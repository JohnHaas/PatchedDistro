Worcester Bleach and Dye Works

The Worcester Bleach and Dye Works is a historic factory complex at 60 Fremont Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. It consists of a pair of primarily brick factory buildings, one of which was built in 1909, and the other built later, between 1911 and 1922, for the named company, which was a major local manufacturer of thread. After the Bleach and Dye Works closed its doors in 1938, the complex has seen a succession of other owners.
The Springdale Dye Works was founded in 1865, and initially operated near Southgate and Gardner Streets on Worcester's south side, and was at the city's industrial height one of six threadmakers. The business's name was changed in 1873 after one of several ownership changes, and in 1879 it moved to premises on Grove Street near the Washburn and Moen Wire Works. In 1888 the company built a wood frame factory at 61 Fremont Street, across the street from the later buildings. This 1888 building was either demolished or partially incorporated into the building now standing on that site.
The first building of the present complex was built in 1909, across the street from the 1888 building. The two buildings were originally joined by a bridge over Fremont Street, evidenced by a doorway on the second floor of the front facade of 60 Fremont. The 1909 building is a two story brick building that fronts directly to the sidewalk on Fremont and Delaware Streets. Its main facade is 18 window bays, and the only major decorative element is the entry bay, which is a Classical Revival style round arch, with granite steps leading up to a recessed entrance. The second brick building is a three story structure, built in a similar style as the first one. The two are connected by a two story wood frame structure that runs the length of the first building, and joins at its southeast corner to the second building. This section was finished in stucco during a 1986 renovation, and is occupied by modern offices.
The Bleach and Dye Works closed in 1938. The next major occupant of the premises was the Economic Machinery Corporation, which machines for handling adhesive labels, and moved out in 1966. Capital Shoe Footwear, founded in 1955, moved in the following year, and was the last shoemaker in the city, closing its doors in 1984. The buildings were purchased by the Valkyrie Corporation the following year, modernized, and used for the production of small leather goods.
The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

2008 Music City Bowl

The 2008 Gaylord Hotels Music City Bowl was the eleventh edition of the college football bowl game played at LP Field in Nashville, Tennessee. The game started at 2:30 pm US CST (2030 UTC) on Wednesday, December 31, 2008. The game, telecast on ESPN, pitted the Vanderbilt Commodores against the Boston College Eagles. The Commodores, playing near their Nashville campus, won 16–14, earned their first bowl win in exactly 53 years, and completed their first winning season since 1982.
Preview.
For the Eagles, this game was the culmination of their tenth consecutive season in a bowl game, a school record. They also entered the game on a streak of eight consecutive bowl wins, the best in Division I FBS. They ended the regular season on a four-game winning streak, but missed out on a chance to gain a BCS berth with a 30-12 loss to Virginia Tech in the ACC Championship Game. The Eagles still had a major milestone to play for, as a win would have given them a third consecutive 10-win season for the first time in school history.
Vanderbilt's recent football history was practically a reverse image of BC's. The Commodores, long hampered by being the only private school in the Southeastern Conference, had gone without a winning season since 1982, and entered the 2008 campaign with only three winning seasons in the last 50 years. While BC was on a streak of 10 consecutive bowl appearances, this was Vandy's first bowl game since a trip to the Hall of Fame Bowl in 1982, and only the fourth in their history.
Despite the Eagles' loss in the ACC title game, they clearly entered the game as the hotter team, winning their last four regular-season games, while Vandy had won only one of their last seven games. The Commodores started out 5-0 for the first time since 1943, rising as high as #13 in the AP Poll. However, their only win for the rest of the regular season was on November 15, when they visited Kentucky and left with a 31-24 win that secured their bowl eligibility.
Neither team was noted for its offensive prowess during the regular season. BC's offense gained an average of 318.5 yards per game, ranking 94th out of 119 FBS teams. Vandy's offense was statistically even weaker, ranking next-to-last in FBS at 260.9 yards per game. The main strength of both teams was defense. The Eagles entered the game ranked sixth in Division I FBS in total defense, giving up 273.4 yards per game. They also led Division I FBS in interceptions (26), turnovers (36), and shutouts (3), and boasted the ACC's defensive player of the year in linebacker Mark Herzlich, who returned two of his six interceptions for touchdowns. Vandy was a less impressive but still respectable 29th in total defense at 318.7 yards allowed per game, and also finished second in the SEC in interceptions with 18.
The game.
First quarter.
Vanderbilt kicked off the game, with the kickoff resulting in a touchback. Starting at their own 20-yard line, BC was only able to gain two yards on their first possession, and punted the ball away to the Commodores, who took possession on their own 41-yard line. The home team, who gave redshirt freshman Larry Smith his first career start at quarterback, proceeded to draw first blood with 11:02 left on a 42-yard field goal by Bryant Hahnfeldt.
After the Commodores forced another Eagles three-and-out on their next series, they got the ball back on their own 35. On their next play from scrimmage, Smith connected with Sean Walker on a 51-yard pass play, giving Vandy a first down at the BC 14. (That play would account for one-fourth of the Commodores' offensive yardage on the day, as they would only gain 200 total yards.) They were unable to put the ball in the end zone, but extended their lead to 6–0 on Hahnfeldt's second field goal of the day, a 26-yarder. The quarter ended with the same score.
Second quarter.
The second quarter saw three key injuries, the game's first turnover, and BC's first sustained drive. Early in the quarter, BC lost center Matt Tennant with an injured elbow, and later lost primary punt returner Rich Gunnell to injury. The next play saw the first turnover of the game, as Vanderbilt's All-SEC cornerback D. J. Moore helped break up a Davis pass that Ryan Hamilton intercepted at the Vandy 15. However, Moore injured his ankle on that play; while he would return in the second half, he could not finish the game.
BC's next possession saw their only sustained drive of the half. Starting with 8:18 left, the Eagles went on a 17-play drive, including a key fourth-down conversion, that culminated in a 4-yard TD pass from Davis to Montel Harris with 1:27 left. The extra point from Steve Aponavicius gave the Eagles a 7–6 lead, and the Commodores chose to end the half by running out the clock.
Third quarter.
BC kicked off, with Vandy returning the ball to their own 27. On the fifth play of the drive, former starting quarterback Chris Nickson entered the game and immediately ran the ball 30 yards to the BC 31, giving the Commodores good position to push for a score. However, the BC defense stiffened, driving Vandy back 11 yards on their next two plays. A third-down incompletion from Smith, who had returned to the game, set the stage for one of the game's key plays.
Brett Upson punted on fourth down from the BC 41. The punt bounced off the left knee of BC's Paul Anderson and went into the end zone, where Vandy's Sean Richardson recovered with 10:35 left. The officials huddled briefly and signaled a Vanderbilt touchdown, which was upheld on review. The ensuing extra point gave the Commodores a 13–7 lead. The remainder of the quarter saw no major action; after two possessions by each team in which the teams moved the ball for only 30 yards combined, the quarter ended with BC driving the ball from their own 3 to their own 41.
Fourth quarter.
The BC drive stalled on the Vandy 42. The next three possessions, two by Vandy and one by BC, ended in three-and-outs; Upson punted for 51 and 58 yards respectively after each Vandy possession, with the second punt being downed at the BC 11 with 7:46 left. The Eagles offense soon came to life, with Davis connecting with Justin Jarvis for 30 yards on third down from their own 15. After an incompletion on the next play, the Eagles scored, with Davis throwing to Colin Larmond, Jr. for a 45-yard touchdown. The ensuing extra point gave BC a 14–13 lead.
Vandy returned the ensuing kickoff to their own 24. On the next play from scrimmage, Eagles defensive end Jim Ramella was called for a face mask penalty, putting the Commodores on their own 44. After an incompletion and 8-yard run from Smith, another former starting quarterback, Mackenzi Adams, went in for what would be his only play of the game. This proved to be a key play for the Commodores when Herzlich was called for roughing the passer, giving them a first down on the BC 34. Nickson was sacked on the next play from scrimmage, but Smith returned to hit George Smith on a 15-yard pass to the BC 25. After a 3-yard loss on third-and-1, the field goal unit came on, and Hahnfeldt kicked a 45-yarder to give the Commodores a 16–14 lead with 3:26 left.
BC went three-and-out on their next possession, and the Commodores got the ball with 2:24 left. Although they were unable to make a first down in that series, the possession was not unproductive, as BC chose to use all three of their timeouts, apparently to give their offense as much time as possible to drive for a potential winning score. The Eagles would get the ball back after an Upson punt at their own 20 with 2:01 left and no timeouts. After an incompletion and a 16-yard pass play, Davis was intercepted for the second time in the game, this time by Myron Lewis, with 1:36 left. Lewis had been beaten by Larmond on BC's previous touchdown play. With the Eagles out of timeouts, the Commodores ran out the clock for the win.
Recap.
Vanderbilt won a bowl game for the first time in exactly 53 years, with their last bowl win being a 25-13 win over Auburn in the Gator Bowl on December 31, 1955. This was also their first win ever over an FBS team with at least nine wins at the time of the game.
The Commodores won despite being held to only 200 yards total offense and converting only one of their 15 third-down attempts. BC gained 331 total yards, and had 17 first downs to Vandy's 8. The major differences in the game proved to be the Eagles' three turnovers, one of which turned into the Commodores' only TD; and the 30 yards of penalties that the Eagles picked up on Vandy's final scoring drive.
Befitting a largely defensive game, the MVP was Vandy punter Upson, who averaged 42.6 yards on his nine punts.

The Eddy Arnold Show is the name of three similar American network television summer variety programs during the 1950s hosted by Eddy Arnold and featuring popular music stars of the day. It was also the name of a radio program starring Arnold.
CBS and NBC.
"The Eddy Arnold Show" debuted on CBS-TV on July 14, 1952 from New York City as a live 15-minute summer replacement for "The Perry Como Show" on Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights from 7:45–8 p.m. ET. Arnold's guitarists Hank Garland and Roy Wiggins (steel guitar) appeared. The program's final broadcast was August 22, 1952.
From July 7 to October 1, 1953, NBC-TV carried "The Eddy Arnold Show" as a live 15-minute summer replacement for "The Dinah Shore Show". The program aired on Tuesday and Thursday nights from 7:30–7:45 p.m. ET, and featured Russ Case and the NBC Orchestra, as well as Garland and Wiggins. Guests included the Davis Sisters; and the Dickens Sisters—Helen, Mary and Patti. The show was directed by Ben Park.
ABC.
"The Eddy Arnold Show" had its longest run on ABC-TV from April 26 to September 26, 1956 as a half-hour series. The live program aired from 8–8:30 p.m. ET on Thursdays as a summer replacement for "Life is Worth Living", then on June 20 moved to 9:30–10 p.m. on Wednesdays.
This show featured a regular cast of Chet Atkins, Garland, Wiggins and the instrumental Paul Mitchell (piano) Quartet. "The Springfield News & Leader" observed that, "The show is plain and warm, utilizing virtually no sets but building its numbers around lighting effects."
The program originated from the Jewell Theatre (before an audience of about 500) in Springfield, Missouri, which was equipped for live television production as the home of ABC's "Ozark Jubilee". Its original producer and writer was Charlie Brown, who left in August 1956 after he had won the Democratic primary election on his way to becoming a US representative. "Jubilee" producer-director Bryan Bisney took over, with the "Jubilee's" Don Richardson becoming writer. Guest stars included:

Vlastislav Hofman (6 February 1884 – 28 March 1964) was a Czech artist and architect. Though he was a painter, set designer, graphic artist, furniture designer, and author, Hofman is best known as an architect strongly influenced by Cubism.
Born in Jičín in Bohemia, Hofman studied architecture in Prague from 1902 to 1907. He was otherwise self-taught in the arts. He was active in avant garde art movements in his homeland, and he associated with artists and writers of the time, including Karel Čapek. Hofman wrote many pieces on political subjects and the philosophy of art, especially for the journal "Právo lidu" ("Human Rights"). His stage designs were mainly for the Vinohrady Theatre (Divadlo na Vinohradich) in Prague. Hofman's design for director Karel Hilar's 1926 production of "Hamlet" was particularly notable.

Woodland Street Historic District

The Woodland Street Historic District is a historic housing district in the Main South area of Worcester, Massachusetts. It consists of 19 Victorian houses that either face or abut on Woodland Street, between Charlotte and Oberlin Streets. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Located directly adjacent to the campus of Clark University, some of the buildings are used by Clark for housing and administration.
When Woodland Street was first developed beginning in the late 1860s, it was on the fringes of development in the city. Seven houses were built on the west side of the street, on large lots, and only a few were built on the east side. In the 1890s development accelerated as growing demand for housing pushed the urbanized parts of the city closer to the area. By 1904, the large lots on the west side were subdivided and filled in with additional houses, and the east side was fully developed.
The houses that were built in the first phase of development are predominantly Second Empire in their styling, although there are three Gothic Revival buildings (110, 114, 140 Woodland) built between 1876 and 1881, as well as the Italianate Charles Kirby House built c. 1870 (105 Woodland). The houses built in the second phase are either Queen Anne (those built early in the 1890s) or Colonial Revival (those built later). The Frank Heath House at 11 Loudon Street is a particularly notable Colonial Revival house, with a high hip roof, a full front porch, and Palladian windows.

Arothron stellatus

Arothron stellatus, also known as the starry puffer, is a demersal marine fish belonging to the family Tetraodontidae. It is found in shallow water in the Indo-Pacific region.
Description.
"Arothron stellatus" is a medium sized fish which grows up to 120 cm length. Its body is oval shape, spherical and relatively elongated. The skin is not covered with scales but is prickly. The fish has no pelvic fin and no lateral line. The dorsal fin and the anal fin are small, symmetric and located at the rear end of the body. The head is large with a short snout which has two pairs of nostrils and the mouth is terminal with four strong teeth.
The background coloration goes from white to grey and the body is harmoniously dotted with black spots. The ventral area is usually more clear. The size of the spots is inversely proportional to the size of the fish, thus a young individual will have large spots and adults of maximal size will have small spots.
The juveniles have a yellowish body background coloration with dark stripes. The young adults still have stripes on the ventral area which will turn to spots later and also some recollection of yellow partially on the body.
Distribution and habitat.
This species is found in tropical and subtropical waters from the Indian Ocean and Red Sea as far as Polynesia, southern Japan, the western, northern and eastern coasts of Australia and Lord Howe Island. It is a relatively uncommon species and lives close to external reef slopes and sheltered lagoons with clear water, but mainly in close proximity to sandy areas, at depths from the surface down to about .
Behavior.
"Arothron stellatus" feeds on benthic invertebrates, sponges, algae, the polyps of corals such as "Acropora", crustaceans and mollusks.
This pufferfish is diurnal. It is mainly solitary and defends a territory.
Potential danger.
"Arothron stellatus" secretes a violent poison, the tetrodotoxin, which protect it from voracious predators. In order to ward off potential enemies, they can inflate their bodies by swallowing air or water.

Whitcomb Mansion

The Whitcomb Mansion (also Whitcomb House) is a historic house at 51 Harvard Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. It is a high Victorian (Queen Anne style) mansion that was built in 1879 as the home of George H. Whitcomb, one of the city's leading businessmen and philanthropists. It is also one of the few surviving houses designed by noted Worcester architect Stephen Earle.
George Whitcomb, a Templeton, Massachusetts native, made a fortune in the business of manufacturing envelopes. In addition to this business, he also dealt in real estate in Worcester and elsewhere. He was active in a number of charitable causes, notably educational causes across the country. After his death in 1918, his house was given to the Society for the Blind.
The house Earle designed for Whitcomb is an asymmetrical polychromatic three story granite structure measuring by . Its front facade is divided into three sections, the central one a projecting gable-ended entry. The front door is flanked by sidelights and is topped by a half-round window, all slightly recessed in an archway. Above the door on the second level of the entry section are a pair of windows, in front of which is a decoratively embellished cast iron balcony. The gable also contains a pair of windows, above which the point of the gable is filled with lighter-colored triangular granite stones. The left section of the main facade is two stories, but the roof is pierced by a single steeply-pitched gable dormer. The right section also has a gable dormer, but is truncated because of the presence of a round tower, which is a full three stories high and is topped by a conical roof. Behind the house stands a carriage house, a single story structure built of local stone, topped by a steep slate roof and cupola.
The interior of the house has retained some of its original details despite alterations made to accommodate the Society for the Blind's use of the building. The downstairs rooms are decorated in a variety of exotic wood finishes, and the walls and ceilings are covered in decorative paintings. The upstairs rooms are finished in cherry, ash, and maple.
The house was listed twice on the National Register of Historic Places: as an individual listing in 1777 (as Whitcomb House) and as part of a multiple resources listing in 1980 (as Whitcomb Mansion).

Apogon maculatus is a cardinalfish from the western Atlantic. The Apogon Maculatus is nocturnal fish, and it usually hides in shadowy areas. This fish can be viewed with a red light in a dark room if needed to. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade because of its uniqueness. In captivity the fish's color tends to fade unless fed color enhancing vitamins. It grows to a size of in length. This fish can be aggressive towards other cardinal fish. Only one should be kept in a tank unless in mated pairs, or two can be placed in a or larger tank. Otherwise it does well with peaceful tank mates as long as it has caves and places to hide. The ideal water conditions are temperatures of , with a pH of 8.1 to 8.4, sg 1.020–1.025, and dKH at 8 to 12.

The William Hogg House is a historic house at 54 Elm Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. The house was first built in 1853 as the Rice House and was significantly altered (technically qualifying as a renovation rather than as a new structure) according to plans by Fuller & Delano. Its front facade has a Corinthian porch sheltering a center entry flanked by bay windows. William Hogg, for whom the house was built, was owner of the Compton Carpet Company.
The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It now serves as dormitory housing for Becker College.

Eddy Arnold Time

Eddy Arnold Time is an American musical television series syndicated to local stations from 1955 through 1957. The show consisted of 26 half-hour filmed episodes starring Eddy Arnold in different roles within a musical narrative. Arnold portrayed, among others, a lumberjack, a traveling salesman, a cowboy, a pet shop owner, himself, and even Stephen Foster.
Production and cast.
Produced, directed and written by Chicago NBC veteran Ben Park, the series featured Betty Johnson, who usually played Arnold's romantic interest; and in supporting roles, the Jordanaires, using the name Gordonaires. A promotional booklet for the program explained that the group used the name Jordanaires "only for their recordings." The more complete explanation is that it legally protected the producers in case the group, which owned the name Jordanaires, left the program prematurely. For this show, the group was composed of Hoyt Hawkins, Hugh Jarett, Neal Matthews, Jr. and Gordon Stoker. Guitarist Hank Garland and Roy Wiggins (steel guitar) also made occasional appearances. A young Ed Asner appeared in one episode. 
The producers termed the program, filmed at Kling Studios in Chicago, Illinois, a "TV filmusical". Production began in October 1954; it was among the earliest syndicated American TV programs. Although popular in some small markets, it suffered from uninspired performances and storylines, a poor soundtrack and inadequate marketing. 
In 1959, episodes were edited together with segments from "The Old American Barn Dance" and Jimmy Dean's "Town and Country Time" (a local Washington, D.C. program) and syndicated by producer Bernard L. Schubert under the title, "Your Musical Jamboree".

Orontium aquaticum

Orontium aquaticum , sometimes called Golden-club, is a species of flowering plants in the Araceae family. It is the single living species in the genus "Orontium", which also contains several extinct species described from fossils. "O. aquaticum" is endemic to eastern North America and is found growing in ponds, streams, and shallow lakes. It prefers an acidic environment. The leaves are pointed and oval with a water repellent surface. The inflorescence is most notable for having an extremely small almost indistinguishable sheath surrounding the spadix. Very early in the flowering this green sheath withers away leaving only the spadix. The sheath was originally classified by Adolf Engler as a spathe due it being the last foliar piece before the spadix. He also noted that species lacked a sympodial leaf. However, in a 1988 paper by Thomas Ray, he argued that the structure was misidentified by Engler and was actually a sympodial leaf. According to Ray the spathe was missing and not the sympodial leaf. This interpretation was determined based on observations of morphological charactestics namely the appearance of a two-keeled bracteole and its positioning. Despite this, the floral structure is still commonly identified in the literature as being a spathe. The flowering occurs in the spring. Native Americans once ate the seeds and rhizome by drying them out and grinding them into a starchy substance.

Whittall Mills

The Whittall Mills is an historic industrial complex off Brussels Street in southern Worcester, Massachusetts. The complex, which was built between 1870 and 1930, is a reminder of the large carpet manufacturing business that was once a major presence in the city. It is a complex of 15 brick buildings located on a bend of the Middle River (a tributary of the Blackstone River), south of Crompton Street and just west of Interstate 295.
The mill complex has its origins in about 1870, when the first of the surviving buildings, a three story brick building with a mansard roof, was erected by the Crompton Rug Company. It was followed a few years later by a dye house. Crompton Rug went out of business in 1879, and these premises were leased to William Hogg, who eventually formed the Worcester Carpet Company, which expanded the complex with a second major mill and the purchase of additional water rights in 1893.
Matthew Whittall, who first gained notice as a supervisor at Crompton Rug, had opened his own factory in other parts of Worcester in 1874. By 1883 his business had grown, and he acquired land next to the Crompton works, where he built a series of buildings over the next 23 years. At the time of the First World War, Whittall was the largest employer in south Worcester, with 1,500 workers operating 350 mills in 500,000 square feet of factory space. The products he produced were purchased by the federal government for use in its buildings, and were selected by President William McKinley for use in the White House.
Whittall sold the mills in 1950. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

John Milton's reception history

The reception history of John Milton and his works has been a mixture of positive and negative responses, with his greatest influence being found within his poetry. 
Contemporary.
Milton's later political works were widely known but were highly controversial and criticized, especially after the Restoration. "The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates" immediately influenced many others, including Bulstrode Whitelocke, John Canne, John Lilburne, John Twyn, and various anonymous works. The amount of attention that the work received prompted John Shawcross to declare that the work, itself, allowed Milton to be viewed as a "great writer". However, the work continued to influence writers later on, including a piece by Algernon Sidney, which copies words directly from "The Tenure"; many responders to Sidney did not know that the lines were Milton's own. 
"Eikonoklastes" suffered a far different fate; it was able to appeal to a larger audience than many of Milton's previous works and sell well, but it was a failure in turning the public sentiment against Charles I. After the Act of Oblivion was enacted on 29 August 1660, a proclamation by the king demanded that "Eikonoklastes" and "Defensio pro Populo Anglicano" be burned. This did not stop the work from selling, and there was a new edition in 1690 after the Glorious Revolution.
Enlightenment.
The generation of poets following the Restoration were influenced by Milton's poetry, especially "Paradise Lost", and viewed it favorably. Alexander Pope, as poet, was heavily influenced by Milton, but he was not as directly attached to the language and concepts within the poetry as other poets, including the English Romantics. However, near the end of his life Pope planned to compose an epic on Brutus, that was to be written in Miltonic blank verse. John Dryden, in an epigram, believed that Milton ranked with Homer and Virgil; but it is uncertain how sincere Dryden was, given that the conventions of the time expected such lofty commendations of individuals. John Dennis praised Milton for composing a poem that was original, and Voltaire teased that France was unable to produce a similarly original epic. 
Samuel Johnson criticized Milton for various things: he attacked Milton for archaic language, he blamed Milton for inspiring bad blank verse, and he couldn't stand Milton's puritan and republican beliefs. Johnson did respect Milton's poetry, and relied on it for many of the quotes contained in his "Dictionary of the English Language". 
Johnson's contemporaries had mixed views of Milton. Although Handel experienced success by setting Milton's poetry to music, including "Il Penseroso", "L'Allegro", and "Samson Agonistes", he refused to transform "Paradise Lost" into an oratorio, objecting to the epic's religious content. Likewise, Edward Gibbon questioned Milton's use of God as a character within a poem and Shaftesbury wondered if it was correct to alter Scripture in such a way. Still, many people believed that "Paradise Lost" equaled the classical epics.
Romantics.
The English Romantic Poets were concerned with Milton's poetry, and they associated themselves with Milton as they sought to explore their own poetic identities. In particular, the various poets relied on images and ideas found in Milton, and they incorporated them into their own works. William Wordsworth, in his "The Prelude", relies on Milton's concept of the fall of man in order to revise the myth and to try and overcome the loss of paradise. John Keats, in "The Eve of St Agnes", relies on images connected to "Paradise Lost" and Eve's description. Percy Shelley, in "Mont Blanc", relies on Milton's description of sensations, especially smell, to achieve the sublime.
20th century.
Kay Stevenson points out that "Milton's "Paradise Lost" and "Paradise Regained" are the seventeenth-century epics which still attract an audience".

Careysburg is a city in Montserrado County, Liberia. It was founded in 1856, and is named in honor of Rev. Lott Carey, the first American Baptist missionary to African and a key figure in the founding of the Colony of Liberia. It is located 15 miles northeast of Monrovia.
It was chartered as a city corporation in 1923, by an act of the Liberian legislature.
Rubber and coffee farming are the major economic activities in the area. It was also the site of a large Voice of America transmitter.
History.
About nine years after Liberia declared its independence on 1847, the Liberian legislature passed an Act authorizing Rev. John Says, as an agent of the American Colonization Society to travel within the country for the purpose of locating an elevated region to establish a settlement to ensure better health conditions for Americo-Liberian settlers. It was further resolved by the Liberian legislature, per Section 12 of said Act: “That the settlement to be founded in the Queh Country shall be named Careysburg, in honor of the late Rev. Lott Carey, and that all other settlements shall be named according to the pleasure of the Legislature". The site that became Careysburg was selected for its abundance of fresh water, potential for agriculture, its cool temperature, absence of deadly mosquitoes, and scenic view. At the time, the people living in the surrounding area were of the Kpelle, Gola and Queh tribes, and Rev. Says negotiated with local tribal chiefs to purchase land.
In 1859, Careysburg was settled by North American freed slaves, mainly from the United States and Barbados. However, some Africans recaptured from ships at sea, destined for sale as slaves in Europe and America, were also settled in Careysburg.

Wellington Street Apartment House District

The Wellington Street Apartment House District of Worcester, Massachusetts encompasses a collection of stylistically similar apartment houses in the city's Main South area. It includes sixteen properties along Jacques Avenue, and Wellington and Irving Streets, most of which were built between 1887 and 1901. The notable exception is the Harrington House at 62 Wellington Street, a c. 1850s Greek Revival house that was virtually the only house standing in the area before development began in the 1880s.
The first other building in the area was also a single family residence, the brick and stone Queen Anne Victorian built in 1855 by Thomas Barrett at 41 Wellington. This was followed in the next few years by six smaller apartment houses that were built with floor plans similar to Worcester's many wood frame triple deckers, but they were built of brick and trimmed in stone. These buildings (23, 25, 37, and 45 Wellington, and 1 and 5 Jacques) were generally owner-occupied.
The development that followed these early buildings was done by developers building income properties, which were larger (at least two apartments per floor), and followed a central hall plan that such apartment blocks followed elsewhere in the city. These were built of brick or stone, and generally trimmed in stone. The only non-residential building in the district is the Gothic Revival First Freewill Baptist Church, designed by Lawrence, Massachusetts architect George Adams and built in 1888.
The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Acanthochromis polyacanthus, the spiny chromis damselfish, is a damselfish from the Western Pacific, which is highly abundant on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Unlike many other coral reef fishes, "A. polyacanthus" has direct development of their larvae, which means that the parents protect their brood from the egg stage (which are laid on the reef), through hatching and onto the fully developed juvenile stage (Kavanagh 2000). There is no pelagic larval stage (unlike the vast majority of coral reef fishes). This form of direct development means that the offspring often take up residence on the reef not far from where they were hatched. Consequently, high levels of local adaptation to their local environment has been recorded in this species (e.g. Fulton et al. 2013). It commonly grows to a length of .

My Elusive Dreams

"My Elusive Dreams" is a country music song written by Billy Sherrill and Curly Putman, which has been recorded by several artists. The best-known version was recorded as a duet by David Houston and Tammy Wynette, becoming a No. 1 hit in October 1967; the song also peaked at No. 89 on the Billboard Hot 100.
The song follows a restless man and his wife, as he attempts to find an ever-elusive and lasting happiness pursing various dreams and schemes, all which are ill-fated. The man's attempts at making something work include stops in at least six states (Texas, Utah, Alabama, Nebraska, Alaska, and Tennessee) and three U.S. cities: Birmingham, Memphis and Nashville. The man admits to his resigned wife that she's tired of following him around the country and that his dreams are fleeting.
Other versions.
Putman's version of the song was released via ABC Records in July 1967, peaking at #41 on the Hot Country Singles charts and #34 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100. Putman's version of the song made its chart debut on the chart dated for July 8, 1967, one week before the Houston-Wynette version.
A third version, recorded by Johnny Darrell, debuted on the country music charts dated for July 22, 1967, released through United Artists Records. This version spent three weeks on the charts and peaked at #73.
Roger Miller recorded a cover in 1968, and in 1970, Bobby Vinton took his version of "My Elusive Dreams" which was also the title to his album of the same name to #27 on the country charts and #46 on the pop charts. Andy Williams released a version in 1974 on his album, "You Lay So Easy on My Mind". In 1975, Charlie Rich took the song again onto the country and pop charts this time taking it to #3 on the country charts and #49 on the pop charts.

Lu Mai

Lu Mai (盧邁) (739 – August 11, 798), courtesy name Zixuan (子玄), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Dezong.
Background.
Lu Mai was born in 739, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His territory of origin is variously reported in the official histories as Fanyang (according to the "Book of Tang") or Henan Municipality (河南, i.e., the eastern capital Luoyang) (according to the "New Book of Tang"). His family traced its origins to a line of officials of Qin Dynasty, Han Dynasty, Cao Wei, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Former Yan and/or Later Yan, Northern Wei, and Tang Dynasty, and he was a distant relative of Lu Han, who served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong's great-grandson Emperor Dezong. Lu Mai's direct male-line ancestors, for several generations, including his grandfather Lu Keming (盧克明) and father Lu Zhao (盧沼), served as local officials. Lu Mai was described as filially pious, loving to his siblings, and careful in his youth, and his maternal uncle Cui Youfu, also a chancellor during Emperor Dezong's reign, loved and respected him.
Early career.
After Lu Mai passed the imperial examinations, he successively served as a scribe for the crown prince (太子正字, "Taizi Zhengzi") and sheriff of Lantian County (藍田, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi). As his written judgments were considered superb, he was then made a secretary at Hunan Municipality. After higher level officials recommended him for his literary talent, he successively served as "You Bujue" (右補闕), a low level official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, "Zhongshu Sheng"); "Shiyushi" (侍御史), an imperial censor; "Xingbu Yuanwailang" (刑部員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of justice (刑部, "Xingbu"), and "Libu Yuanwailang" (吏部員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, "Libu"). During a famine caused by a locust infestation, Lu requested an assignment to the Yangtze River region, because at that time his uncle and siblings were all in that region. He was thus made the prefect of Chu Prefecture (滁洲, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui). He later returned to the capital Chang'an to serve as "Simen Langzhong" (司門郎中), a supervisorial official at the ministry of justice and then "You Jianyi Daifu" (右諫議大夫), an advisor at the legislative bureau. While serving there, he often submitted suggestions to the emperor. He later served as imperial attendant (給事中, "jishizhong"), when he was set to be evaluated for a further evaluation for promotion. He declined, on the basis that he had not served long as "jishizhong" and therefore should not be considered for yet another promotion at that time. For this, he was much respected by others, and he was later promoted to be "Shangshu You Cheng" (尚書右丞), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau (尚書省, "Shangshu Sheng"). While he was serving there, there was an occasion when the minister of palace affairs, Yuan Gen (元亙), was supposed to serve as the ceremonial sacrifice leader for sacrifices to Emperor Dezong's deceased wife Empress Wang. Yuan declined on the basis that the sacrifices to Empress Wang were set on a day that one of his parents had died, and the imperial censors submitted an indictment against Yuan for insubordination. A number of officials were convened to discuss the indictment, and Lu pointed out that Yuan's duty should be first to the state, and he should not have declined on the basis of a family matter. Yuan was thus fined.
Chancellorship, resignation, and death.
In 793, Lu Mai was given the designation "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor "de facto", serving with Jia Dan, Lu Zhi, and Zhao Jing. As Lu Zhi and Zhao effectively were the lead chancellors, Lu Mai was not much involved in the major decisions, and he was said to be cautious and obedient to the law. He was also praised for personally attending the funeral of a cousin, as at that time, chancellors often considered themselves too important to attend the funerals of distant relatives.
In 796, Lu Mai suffered a stroke while at the office of the chancellors, and was taken home in a litter. He offered to resign, but Emperor Dezong declined. As Lu Zhi had by this point been demoted and exiled, Zhao had died, on an occasion when Jia was away observing a memorial for a parent, there was no chancellor on duty, and Emperor Dezong had to send eunuchs to the office of the chancellors to make sure that the affairs of the state were being attended to. Lu Mai subsequently submitted five petitions offering to resign, and in 797, Emperor Dezong approved his resignation and made him "Taizi Bingke" (太子賓客), an advisor to his crown prince Li Song. Lu died in 798 and was given posthumous honors. As his two marriages did not yield a son, his heir Lu Ji (盧紀) was a son of a cousin.

Précieuse

Précieuse ("precious") is the sword of Baligant, the Saracen king in the French epic "The Song of Roland".
Baligant allegedly named his sword in response to hearing that Charlemagne's sword had a name. Throughout the epic, there are several contrasts between the two, with Baligant being portrayed as a foolish counterpart to Charlemagne. Baligant felt inferior, and so named his sword with a similar name.

Suzuki GT series

The Suzuki GT series of motorcycles was introduced to the world in the fall of 1971 as 1972 model year (MY) motorcycles. The final MY of production was 1977 although some markets continued to receive the GT380 to the end of the 1980 MY. In the interests of brevity the single-cylinder models designated as GT have been omitted from this article because they were produced much later and were not true grand tourer (GT) models in the strictest sense.
GT380, GT550, GT750.
The initial lineup consisted of the following models:
Engines.
All engines were piston ported two-stroke types equipped with Suzuki's proven, reliable and very economical Crankcase Cylinder Injection (CCI) multipoint oil injection system (previously known as PosiForce), conventional battery/points ignition system and chain-type final drive. The engines were designed following Suzuki's typical conservative design philosophy and featured classic Schnuerle porting. In a major departure for Suzuki, the alternator fitted was a three-phase excited field type using brushes and slip rings with a wound rotor. A solid state rectifier and a mechanical three-step regulator completed the system.
Up to this point, Suzuki had typically used a permanent magnet single phase alternator setup on its bikes so the new equipment was quite a step up for the GT series. 
The 380 and 550 engines were air-cooled with a system that Suzuki christened "Ram Air". This system consisted of a cast aluminum shroud covering a modified cylinder head to direct the cooling air.
The GT750, however, was liquid-cooled. Suzuki thus led the motorcycle world by being the first company to mass-produce a liquid-cooled motorcycle - a big-bore two-stroke. The GT750 was quickly nicknamed the "Water Buffalo" in North America, the "Wasserbuffel" in Germany, the "Kettle" in the UK and the "Water Bottle" in Australia as signs of the affection felt by owners for this high-torque two-stroke roadburner. This affection continues well into the new millennium, with the GT750 having a large and loyal following worldwide dedicated to the reclamation and restoration of this unique machine.
Piston rings.
Like all engines of this period, the 550 started life with chrome-plated piston rings running in cast iron cylinder bores. However, for the 1976 MY, the 550 received a very forward-thinking design change that featured cast-iron rings running in chrome-plated cylinder bores. 
This change was largely thanks to the RE5, which also used 'SCEM' (Suzuki Composite Electrochemical Material) in its combustion chamber - although their race department may also have had an input. 
Production and sales went along quite successfully from the initial 1972 introduction, no doubt helped by periodic updates and the introduction of the smaller-capacity models for beginners.
Carburetors.
An important change for the 1974 MY was the "unitizing" of the carburetors on all of the three-cylinder machines. For MYs 1972 and 1973 the carburetors had been three separate items with the complex cabling that such an arrangement entails. The unitized carburetors were mounted to a single bracket with a much less complex single push-pull cable arrangement. This arrangement allowed easier and more durable synchronization of the carburetors. This practice was continued through to the end of production of the three-cylinder models. At this point the GT750 received the new Mikuni BS40 type diaphragm style carburetors. These proved to be somewhat troublesome but were eventually sorted out with some remedial jetting work in the field. All the smaller models stayed with the tried and true Mikuni VM type round slide carbs.
Exhaust system.
Another feature differentiating the three-cylinder GT models from their competitors was the bifurcation of the centre cylinder exhaust header. This allowed Suzuki to use four mufflers rather than the "unbalanced 2 and 1" arrangement used by the Japanese competition...or the "three into two" exhaust arrangement favoured by the British manufacturers of three-cylinder machines.
Starting.
The GT550 and GT750 also sported electric starting which is not truly necessary on a two-stroke engine, even ones as large as these. Apparently the sales department felt that the "electric leg" was a must-have item to keep up with the competitors. All other models, with the exception of the GT185, were kick start only.
Transmission.
All models were equipped with five-speed transmissions with the exception of the GT250 and GT380 which had a six-speed.
Brakes.
As well, all models were equipped with drum brakes front and rear. This arrangement only lasted for the 1972 MY. Suzuki did offer owners the option of a dealer implemented upgrade from the twin leading shoe drum front brake to a twin disc set-up but this was extremely expensive. 
All of the 1973 MY three-cylinder machines were equipped with hydraulically operated single disc brakes on the front while retaining their drum brakes on the rear. The GT750, however, had dual discs up front to cater for the braking requirements of this heavier and more powerful machine. This dual disc brake setup was another big "first" for Suzuki since all the competitors were using single front discs only at this time.
Design.
All three GT models followed Suzuki's usual conservative design principles. The frames were all-welded mild steel tubing with long wheelbases to give stability at high speed.
Colour schemes.
Each of these models was available in two different colour schemes with the GT750 being available in three colours in most markets for the initial MY only. It reverted to two colour schemes for succeeding MYs. The engines were mildly tuned to produce more torque than the competition who were producing highly stressed machines with outright power for straight line performance. Suzuki was more concerned with durability and ease of use for its customers. The GT series of machines were large and substantial motorcycles designed for high speed highway riding following the tradition of European touring cars.
GT380 for Italy.
A marketing anomaly concerned the GT380. The actual engine displacement as introduced in the 1972 MY was 371cc and the 380 stayed this way until the end of production for most market areas. However, for the Italian market only, the GT380 received a displacement increase to 384cc starting with the 1975 MY. This engine size was continued through to the end of production for Italy alone. This was a counter to an Italian government import ban on bikes less than 380cc and less than 170 kg. Suzuki simply increased the bore of the GT380 to 55 mm, thus making the engine capacity now 384cc. Suzuki also made sure that the data plate riveted to the frame showed a weight of 171 kg.
GT250.
For the 1973 MY, the venerable T250 twin was updated with new bodywork, gained Ram Air cooling, a single disc brake in front and was now designated GT250. This model thus filled the important 250cc displacement slot in Suzuki's GT lineup. The GT250 retained its original engine and six-speed transmission, both remaining basically unchanged from the T20 X6 Hustler of 1966 through the T250 model to the 1972 MY. The marketing name of "Hustler" was retained for the North American market.
The GT250 continued on with minor changes until the 1976 MY when the engine was changed substantially, both internally and externally. Porting changes now saw the cylinders with four larger transfer ports instead of the previous two smallish ones as well as changes to the CCI system in the crankshaft main bearing area. The carburetors became 28 mm in size instead of 26 mm, the mufflers were modified to cater for the increased airflow through the engine and the transmission ratios were revised to more evenly match the new powerband. The Ram Air cover for the head was deleted and the stock finning on the heads was increased in height to gain the same effect as the Ram Air used to give.
GT185.
Also for the 1973 MY, Suzuki introduced the GT185 twin-cylinder model, which was equipped with Ram Air cooling and drum brakes front and rear. It was marketed in North America as the "Adventurer". It also had a unique combination electric starter/generator setup. For the 1974 MY, the GT185 gained a single-disc front brake to rationalize it with the other GT models. It then remained basically unchanged, except for colour and trim items (which included a tail fairing in the 1977 'B' model and cast wheels in the final year 1978 'EC' model), through to the end of production with the 1978 MY.
In some markets the GT185 became the RG185 and was sold with different trim.
GT125.
The 1974 MY also saw Suzuki introduce the GT125 to the motorcycling world. This model was similar in layout to the GT185 but with a shorter wheelbase and smaller engine displacement so shared only a few common parts. The rest of this model's equipment followed that of the GT185. The electric starter was deleted, probably in the interests of economy, which allowed a more attractive selling price in the very competitive "beginner" market that this model competed in. This model continued basically unchanged, excepting colours and trim items (the 'B' model in 1977 got a tail fairing), until the end of production with the 1977 MY. 
Some markets received 1978 MY (the 'EC' which had tail fairing & cast wheels) & there were MY 1979 & MY 1980 versions of this model with the name changing to RG125 X4. 
The final GT125s were updated and sold with cast wheels and a tail fairing.
Suzuki listed the RG125 X4 in their sales literature until 1980 in continental Europe.
GT500.
For the 1976 MY, the aging two-cylinder T500 Titan was given a new front end with a single-disc brake as well as freshened up bodywork. It was henceforth known as the GT500. The GT500 was discontinued at the end of the 1977 MY, so had a very short production life. The GT500 was not graced with Ram Air cooling, probably because Suzuki already knew that their large-capacity two-stroke road bikes were reaching the end of their production lives. It was probably a way to get a few more sales dollars from what had now become a very dated design reaching back to the 1968 MY.
Introduction of four-stroke engines.
With the 1977 MY Suzuki, bowing to the inevitable, had introduced its line of four-stroke GS machines starting with the 750cc and the 400cc twin-cylinder. These were soon followed by the 550 four-cylinder and a little later the 1000 four-cylinder models. 
The two-strokes and four-strokes were sold side by side for one MY. 
The glory days of smooth and sophisticated two-stroke road machines came to an end with the 1977 MY.
Competition machines.
The Suzuki factory went racing at various levels with both the GT750 and the T500. The models were the TR750 and TR500, respectively.

Ancient synagogue (Barcelona)

The Ancient Synagogue of Barcelona (, , ) is believed to be an ancient synagogue located in the centre of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It has been described as one of the oldest synagogues in Europe. After many centuries of use for other purposes, the building re-opened as a synagogue and museum in 2002. No congregation prays regularly at the "Sinagoga Major", but it is used for festive occasions.
History.
Archaeological investigations show that the original structure of the building was built in the third or fourth century; whether this structure was the synagogue cannot be said with certainty. The building was significantly expanded during the 13th century. Medieval Barcelona is known to have had several synagogues, and the main synagogue was certainly in the immediate area. King James I visited the synagogue in 1263 at the conclusion of the Barcelona Disputation. Shlomo ben Aderet served as the rabbi of the "Sinagoga Major" for 50 years.
The Jews of Barcelona were massacred in 1391. The building has been used for many purposes and its original use was forgotten. Over the centuries, additional stories were added to the building.
In 1987, Jaume Riera y Sans began researching the location of the "Sinagoga Major". His research was based on a reconstruction of the route followed by a thirteenth-century tax collector that ended at the "Sinagoga Major".
Riera's work led Miguel Iaffa to examine the exterior of the building. Iaffa noted that the structure had been built in compliance with religious requirements that the building should face Jerusalem and that it should have two windows. In fact, the eastward orientation of the building (toward Jerusalem) broke with the northwest/southeast alignment of the streets in its neighborhood.
Iaffa purchased the building in 1995 when its owner put it up for sale. The Call Association of Barcelona (), led by Iaffa, undertook the recovery and restoration of the synagogue. The "Sinagoga Major" was opened to the public in 2002, and it drew 20,000 visitors during 2005.
In 2003, two Canadians became the first couple to be married at the "Sinagoga Major" in more than 600 years. A New York attorney donated a 500-year-old "sefer Torah" (Torah scroll) to the synagogue in 2006.
Barcelona also has a handsome, active, modern synagogue, the "Comunidad Israelita de Barcelona."
In 2011, after a meltdown within the property, former Scotland and Hibernian defender Corey Almond bought the synagogue and refurbished to its former traditional state. He bought the synagogue because he thought it was 'beautiful and was a hub for sightseeing Jewish believers'

The WCIS Bank is a historic and unusual bank building at 365 Main Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. It is fashioned out of two separate buildings, each of which has served as a home for the Worcester County Institution for Savings, the county's first chartered savings bank (in 1828). The older part of the building, from c. 1851, is at the corner of Foster and Norwich Street, and was built as a joint venture between the bank's parent, the Worcester Bank, and the Boston and Worcester Railroad Company. It is a granite structure three stories high, decorated in Italianate styling. The WCIS in 1906 moved to a new building at the corner of Main and Foster (365 Main Street), another granite three story building with large Doric columns in the center of its main facade. Needing additional space, the bank repurchased the Foster Street building, and joined the two together in 1953.

2009–10 NCAA football bowl games

The 2009–10 NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision College Football Post-Season followed the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season. It comprises 34 team-competitive bowl games, and three all-star games. The games began play on December 19, 2009 and included the 2010 BCS National Championship Game in Pasadena, California, played on January 7 at the Rose Bowl Stadium. The post-season concluded with three all-star games: the East-West Shrine Game on January 23, the Senior Bowl on January 30, and the Texas vs. The Nation Game on February 6.
The NCAA divided Division I schools into two divisions starting in 1978: The Football Bowl Subdivision (known as Division I-A from 1978–2005) does not have a playoff system, but instead stages Bowl Games. The Championship Game participants are chosen based on their end-of-season conference standings and positions in national rankings (compiled by polls and computers). Participants to other bowl games are based on this, plus discretion of that bowl's organizers (what teams will deliver a compelling game, including TV & Gate receipts). The Football Championship Subdivision (known through this same period as Division I-AA) plays in a sixteen-team, single elimination tournament for a recognized national championship, with the notable exception of the Ivy League and the Southwestern Athletic Conference, which abstain from participation in this playoff. The Ivies choose to limit their football schedule to 10 games and have a long-standing policy against playing postseason football, whereas the SWAC opts for a longer, more easily scheduled regular season, and profitable rivalry games like the nationally televised Bayou Classic in the Louisiana Superdome and the SWAC Championship Game. Between 1991 and 1999, the Heritage Bowl matched top teams from the historically black colleges and universities in a Division I-AA bowl game.
Selection of the teams.
NCAA by-laws state that a school with a record of 6–6 in regular season play is eligible only if conferences cannot fill out available positions for bowl games with teams possessing seven (or more) wins (excluding games played in Hawaii and conference championship games in the ACC, Big 12, Conference USA, Mid-American Conference and the SEC). An example was in 2008 when the Big Ten, the Big 12 and SEC each had two teams selected for the Bowl Championship Series games – Ohio State and Penn State from the Big Ten, Texas and Oklahoma from the Big 12 and Alabama and Florida from the SEC. With each conference sending two teams to the BCS, these three conferences forfeited several bowl game slots due to a lack of teams with a winning record.
As with the 2006 and 2008 seasons, all eligible teams with at least 7 wins made it in to a bowl game. Of the 71 eligible teams, only 68 could play in a game, and all three eligible teams that sat out bowl season were 6-6: Louisiana-Lafayette, Louisiana-Monroe, and Notre Dame, who opted not to play in a bowl game themselves after the firing of head coach Charlie Weis.
For the first time in BCS history, every participant in a BCS bowl was ranked in the top 10 of the final BCS standings.
Fox ends BCS contract.
Fox Sports no longer broadcast the Bowl Championship Series following the conclusion of the Orange Bowl on January 5; the network had carried the first three BCS National Championship stand-alone games. ABC telecast this season's contest because of their separate agreement with the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, the organizers of the Rose Bowl Game and the hosts of the 2010 national championship. Beginning in 2011, ABC sibling company ESPN will begin carrying all of the BCS bowls, in an agreement that will last through 2014. Fox has signed a long-term contract extension with the AT&T Cotton Bowl Classic through 2014, with a new prime-time Friday night date starting in 2011.
Sponsorship and stadium changes.
Maaco became the new title sponsor of the Las Vegas Bowl replacing Pioneer Corporation, and the game was rebranded as the Maaco Bowl Las Vegas. In another change, the Motor City Bowl thanks to Little Caesars now carries the name of the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl. Advocare became the title sponsor of the Independence Bowl. In a stadium shift, the Cotton Bowl Classic moves from its self-named home for 73 years at the grounds of Fair Park to Jerry Jones's new Cowboys Stadium in Arlington. The St. Petersburg Bowl was initially to be played without a sponsor after being sponsored by MagicJack in 2008, but just a few weeks before the Bowl, Beef O'Brady's agreed to be the sponsor, so the game became the "St. Petersburg Bowl presented by Beef O'Brady's".
New bowls in 2010–11.
The Cotton Bowl in Fair Park will be the site of a new bowl game, the TicketCity Bowl, on New Years Day 2011, with the Big Ten and Conference USA providing opponents, and Yankee Stadium will host a game dubbed the Pinstripe Bowl in December 2010, pitting teams from the Big East and Big 12. This contest would be the first bowl game in the Metropolitan New York area since the now defunct Garden State Bowl, and the first in New York City since the now defunct Gotham Bowl was played in the original Yankee Stadium, while a third bowl, called the Cure Bowl benefiting Susan G. Komen for the Cure would pit members of the Sun Belt Conference and C-USA at Bright House Networks Stadium on the campus of the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida. The NCAA Football Issues Committee must approve of these games in the spring of 2010 to make them official.
Coaching changes.
As a result of head coaching changes between the regular season and the bowl season, the following teams played their postseason contests with interim head coaches:
In addition, the following coach retired, but worked his team's bowl game:

USCGC Half Moon (WAVP-378)

USCGC "Half Moon" (WAVP-378), later WHEC-378, was a "Casco"-class United States Coast Guard cutter in service from 1948 to 1969.
Construction and U.S. Navy service.
"Half Moon" began life as the United States Navy "Barnegat"-class seaplane tender USS "Half Moon" (AVP-26). She was laid down on 10 March 1942 by Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, Washington, launched on 12 July 1942, and commissioned into the U.S. Navy on 15 June 1943. She served in the New Guinea campaign and Philippines campaign during World War II, and at Okinawa and in the Philippines postwar. She was decommissioned on 4 September 1946 and placed in reserve.
Transferred to the United States Coast Guard.
"Barnegat"-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed.
The U.S. Navy loaned "Half Moon" to the United States Coast Guard on 30 July 1948. After undergoing conversion for Coast Guard use, she was commissioned into the Coast Guard on 14 September 1948 as USCGC "Half Moon" (WAVP-378).
U.S. Coast Guard service.
Atlantic operations 1948-1967.
"Half Moon" was stationed at Staten Island and Governors Island in New York City throughout her Coast Guard career. Her primary duty was to serve on ocean stations in the Atlantic Ocean to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and-rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and engaged in law enforcement operations.
On 24 August 1951 and 25 August 1951, "Half Moon" assisted the merchant ship "Castello Guadalest" in the Atlantic at Latitude 39°30’ North, Longitude 58°32’ West.
While in Bermuda on a United States Coast Guard Reserve training cruise, "Half Moon" helped civil authorities in Bermuda fight a fire aboard the merchant ship "Coastal Service" at Ordnance Wharf, St. Georges, Bermuda, on 14 August 1963.
"Half Moon" was reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-378 on 1 May 1966. Her loan period from the U.S. Navy came to an end on 26 September 1966, when she was transferred permanently from the Navy to the Coast Guard.
On 11 January 1967, "Half Moon" seized four American fishing vessels seven nautical miles (13 kilometers) northwest of Dog Rocks following a shooting incident in which one person was killed and another wounded. 
Vietnam War service 1967.
"Half Moon" sailed from New York Harbor on 1 April 1967 under the command of Commander Emmett G. McCarthy, bound for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and an assignment to Coast Guard Squadron Three. The squadron, which was designated Task Unit 70.8.6, was activated at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 24 April 1967 when its commander, Captain John E. Day, hoisted his pennant aboard his flagship, Coast Guard cutter USCGC "Gresham" (WHEC-387).
Coast Guard Squadron Three was tasked to operate in the South China Sea in conjunction with U.S. Navy forces in Operation Market Time, the interdiction of communist coastal arms and munitions traffic along the coastline of Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The squadrons other Vietnam War duties included fire support for ground forces, resupplying Coast Guard and Navy patrol boats, and search-and-rescue operations. Serving in the squadron with "Gresham" and "Half Moon" were cutters USCGC "Yakutat" (WHEC-380), USCGC "Barataria" (WHEC-381), and USCGC "Bering Strait" (WHEC-372); like "Half Moon" and "Gresham", they all were former Navy "Barnegat"-class ships. They departed Pearl Harbor on 26 April 1967 and reported to Commander, United States Seventh Fleet, for Market Time duty on 4 May 1967. They were joined by Navy radar picket destroyer escorts (DERs) of Escort Squadrons 5 and 7. 
The ten Market Time ships arrived at Subic Bay in the Philippines on 10 May 1967. The five Coast Guard cutters and five Navy destroyer escorts continuously manned four Market Time stations off Vietnam, while only Navy warships served on two Taiwan patrol stations. One ship rotated duty as the station ship in Hong Kong. 
During her tour, "Half Moon" conducted nine naval gunfire missions in support of forces ashore. On 12 September 1967 she was ordered to fire on an enemy build-up in An Xugen Province; her gunfire killed at least one enemy soldier and destroyed three Viet Cong fortifications on that occasion. During her tour, she was credited with killing at least 13 Viet Cong soldiers, destroyed 64 military emplacements and structures, and sinking four sampans.
"Half Moon" also served as a home base for 50-foot (15.25 m) U.S. Navy fast patrol craft (or "Swift boats") and participated in search and rescue operations. 
"Half Moon" concluded her Vietnam War tour on 29 December 1967.
Atlantic operations 1968-1969.
"Half Moon" returned from Vietnam to her home port at New York City on 22 January 1968 and resumed her rotuine Coast Guard operations in the Atlantic. On 11 July 1968 she helped to evacuate an injured crewman from the West German merchant ship "Brunsdeich". 
Decommissioning and disposal.
The Coast Guard decommissioned "Half Moon" on 15 July 1969. She was sold for scrapping on 29 April 1970 to Cantieri Navali, Genoa, Italy, for a bid price of $66,000 (USD).

Chrysiptera starcki

Chrysiptera starcki is a species of damselfish known by the common name Starck's demoiselle. It is native to the western Pacific Ocean, where it has been reported from the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan to Australia, New Caledonia, and Tonga. It was originally described in 1973 as "Abudefduf starcki".
Description.
Starck's demoiselle is blue with a yellow stripe down its back. It grows up to 7 cm in length.
Ecology.
The fish lives around reefs, often in deeper, outer areas, up to 60 metres deep. It lives in crevices in rocky areas. It pairs up to breed and the male guards and tends the eggs. In the wild, Starck's demoiselle will eat plankton (both zooplankton and phytoplankton). 
Aquariums.
This is a highly desired fish for a saltwater aquarium. Shallow waters are best for the fish. It can be very colorful if fed the correct diet. The minimum aquarium size is 76 L (20 gal). The tank should be decorated with rocks or gravel and should have many hiding places for the fish. It is not a very aggressive fish, but as it gets bigger it may harass smaller, more passive fish. Two of them together in a tank will fight, however. They are very easy to keep in captivity. They will eat many different types of foods in captivity.
Breeding.
When breeding, males will swim back and forth swiftly flashing their colors to attract females. Males will prepare a territory full of rubble for the female to lay her eggs. Then the male will fertilize them and aggressively defend them from intruders.

<doc id="20590712" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20590712" title="Anglo-Saxon women">
Anglo-Saxon women

Women in Anglo-Saxon England were near equal companions to the males in their lives, such as husbands and brothers, much more than in any other era before modern time. Despite this sense of equality in some strata of society, Anglo Saxon women were still subject to concubinage. This equal status prevailed until the Norman Conquest of 1066, at which point a military society re-envisioned women as unimportant.
Occupations.
Women and children were generally involved in tasks that required little physical work. Though, due to climate and weather constraints, women may have done the work that needed attention at the time. While men were ox-herders, labourers, swine-herders, and so forth, women were cheese-makers and dairy-maids. They were also bakers, though not cooks. In Old English the word for cook is "coc", and is only found in the masculine form, while "baecere" and "bascestre" respectively represent the feminine and masculine forms of baker. Female slaves were corn-grinders, serving maids, wet-nurses, weavers, and seamstresses. Common free women may have been found spinning as well as weaving. Women and ladies, including queens, would serve drinks for company and family. This was not only a job for a woman of lower-class, though it would have likely been done by a low-class woman if one were present. Women of this time were also entertainers, comedians, and singers, and may have been employed by households or travelling groups.
Status.
Gender was influenced by social status, religion and sexuality. Many women in Anglo-Saxon England were of solid stance in society. They were not only allowed to have private influence, but also a wide liberty of intervention in public affairs.
Christianity.
Churches in Anglo-Saxon England stressed doctrines that preached about virginity as a virtue and faithful monogamy; this is believed to have limited an individual’s chances of acquiring status, political power and property. Anglo-Saxon England was the first place in history that women had been raised to sainthood, and this was the strongest immediately following the acceptance of Christianity. Within the church women appeared to have been equal as well there are evidences of anti-feminism found in Homilies. Although anti-feminism was found in Homilies, it does not seem to hold true in practice. Women that went into the convent and took vows of poverty, chastity and obedience were glorified in the eyes of the Church and its Fathers. The convent offered self-development and social responsibility to women, something that women are fighting for today. Uniquely, the Anglo-Saxon church had institutions that consisted of male and female monasteries, located together but segregated, and in these the female abbot had the headship of the institution. Convents were run by abbesses, and this was an opportunity for women to have a position of authority. They were responsible for the finances and managing the property, with some the help of the other nuns. This control that women had did not survive the Viking invasion of 789, although women continued to play a major role in the church in late Anglo-Saxon England. Single gendered convents and monasteries had the chores that were commonly done by the other sex would have been performed by the common sex in that location; examples are men would have worked in the kitchens of monasteries and women would have worked in the gardens of nunneries.
It is clear that there were equal opportunities for men and women in the Christian Church in Anglo-Saxon England, but it is still important to look at the “Patriarchs of the Bible.” Although women were given these opportunities it is crucial that they were given them by men and that the Church's significant positions of authority were held by men. Thus the gender differences and coping with the ideological conflicts that have to due with sexuality and kinship resulted from the introduction of Christianity.
Marriage and divorce.
In Anglo-Saxon England there were many laws related to marriage. Some historians profess that the law that either widow, nor maiden was forced to marry a man that she disliked as being a sign of equality however Aethelberht's law contradicts this in as much as a man is legally allowed to steal another man's wife as long as he pays him reparation. Once married, a woman was to situate herself as the object of her husband’s subjectivity, she was to become the object of his protection and the property, although she still remained the owner of her property. The Church saw that married women had no authority and were to stand under the lordship of men. Therefore under the church they were not able to teach, witness, take an oath, nor be a judge. In marriage a male often developed his sphere of influence through his wife. Although women were seen as such under the church while married there were laws that protected them in the public sphere. Divorce was rare and the only documented ones were in times of Adultery. A woman that commits Adultery by sleeping with a man that was not her husband while he was still alive was subject to give what she owned to her husband. Æthelraed’s 1008 code states that widows shall remain unmarried for 12 months after the death of her husband, at which point they have the freedom to choose. This was likely the case to allow for the widows have time to think and not make any rash decisions which may have led to relationships or commitments.
A prospective husband paid money or offered land for a woman’s hand in marriage. This was paid to her directly and she had the right to do with it as she pleased. It is made clear that the marriage finances were held by both man and woman. A woman was free to leave a marriage, keeping in mind the only times divorce was documented in cases of adultery, and if the woman did leave and take the children she was entitled to half the property. These gifts were substantial sums and generally property. The gifts given by the groom were sometimes viewed as a sale of the bride, when in reality it was to safeguard her interests and add security.
Sexual mores.
According to the church sexual desires were evil and sinful, thus appeared as so; therefore women were not to orgasm or enjoy sex. Many times sex was not gentle, because it was a sense of security for the man and not meant to please the woman. When it came to paying for sex with a woman belonging to the King she would have cost roughly 30 shillings, while a commoner only 6 shillings. The transfer of money for sex shows that there was the presence of prostitution, although it is not clearly stated whether the women were forced into the act or not, and this issue is still up for debate, although there still was the sex trade. The fact that rape to a slave was more expensive than seduction of a free woman shows how rape was viewed so negatively in society, although the law protected women against both actions. Laws of Ælfred go into great detail regarding laws about sexual assaults. An example of the law committed by a man was King Æthebald of Mercia who was punished for numerous reasons, including violating holy nuns that were virgins consecrated to God. When compensation was paid a free woman, ceorl or ranked above, she collected the money directly, and the money for slaves went to their owner. It is also unclear as to whether the wife or husband received the money for their servants. Rape as a topic is important because it relates to gender relations, class status, property rights, judicial, female agency, religious virtues of integrity of the body and representation in of all of these in a society. Sexual assaults were greatly penalized whether it was a slave or free woman. Burials suggest that a raped body was unceremonious. Even some men of this era applauded other men who beat their wives and some men even thought that a wife should be beat regularly, unfortunately this was encouraged by the clergy. Even though there were law protecting women that had been raped many times the acts went unpunished, for lack of information or time, the women herself would not tell anyone until many years after, or no one really took an interest in the crime; a wash woman is an example of a typical victim of unnoticed rape.
Sex and rape were also found in literature. There are actual and threatened acts of violent sexual assaults presence in the literature and legal texts; an example is the homily of Wulfstan, a text in which he wrote about women being raped in the hands of the Viking.
Laws.
The written law only represents a portion of the laws that impacted the lives of women; therefore they only reflect partial views of what actually happened. Despite what the churches doctrines taught, women were considered to be a member of the state and their rights were protected, regardless of their status as maiden, widow or wife. Women were classed as oath worthy and could appear as grantors, grantees and witnesses of charters. Women were held responsible and accountable under the law for their activity, although were not held accountable for any criminal activity that her husband did, unless she was a willing accessory to the crime. Along with being law abiding them, they received appropriate compensation for crimes that were committed against them, and the compensation was paid directly to them.
Wills.
Women had property rights and many landowners were women. They were able to bequeath land, as shown in numerous wills. Leaving property by means of a will was not restricted to kin; it could also be left to servants, religious figures, and churches. Documents of wills and charters show that women owned estates, by virtue of grant, will, or inheritance, and that they were seen roughly equal in the common life of the countryside. Evidence in these documents shows no preference to daughters or sons as heirs. Ceorl women and others of high rank were responsible for their homes. Some of the items that women would commonly receive via trust or inheritance were real property estates, slaves, livestock, household furnishings, clothing, jewels, and books. Items such as table clothes, bed sheets, and wall hangings were considered women's property because women made them.
Health.
Anglo-Saxons had warnings for pregnant women, including avoiding foods that were too salty or sweet, pork, and other fatty foods. They were also told to abstain from strong alcohol and too much drink and to avoid travel on horseback. If a woman were to stop menstruating supposedly due to a lack of nutrients and was not pregnant, she was to take hot baths, drink hot herb teas, and dress warmly.

Kentucky In Africa

Kentucky In Africa was a colony settled by freed African-American slaves in present-day Montserrado County, Liberia. 
A Kentucky state affiliate of the American Colonization Society was formed in 1828, and members raised money to transport Kentucky blacks — freeborn volunteers as well as slaves set free on the stipulation that they leave the United States — to Africa. The Kentucky society bought a site along the Saint Paul River and named it Kentucky in Africa. Clay-Ashland was the colony's main town.
Notable residents of Kentucky In Africa include William D. Coleman, the 13th President of Liberia, whose family settled in Clay-Ashland after immigrating from Fayette County, Kentucky, United States when he was a boy. Alfred F. Russell, the 9th President of Liberia, also resided in Clay-Ashland.

Stegastes planifrons

Stegastes planifrons, the threespot damselfish, is a damselfish from the Western Atlantic. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade.
Description.
The adult threespot damselfish is a brownish-grey bony fish with a dusky yellow sheen and a large black spot at the base of the pectoral fins. It grows to a size of 13 cm in length. The large dorsal fin has 12 spines and 15-17 soft rays. The anal fin has two spines and 13-14 soft rays. Neither the pectoral nor pelvic fins have spines.
Juveniles are a much brighter yellow. They have a few tiny blue spots on the head and upper body, including one on the upper iris. They have three distinctive black spots, one at the junction between the dorsal fin spines and the soft rays, one dorsally on the caudal peduncle, and a third smaller one just above the base of the pectoral fins. These tend to have a faint blue rim, and the pectoral spot is absent in very young juveniles, becoming more prominent as the juvenile grows.
Distribution and habitat.
The threespot damselfish is found at depths down to about in the western Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from Florida through the Caribbean Sea to the Bahamas. It is a demersal fish and its favoured habitats are inshore and offshore coral reefs. It is often found among staghorn coral and at night may be found in caves.
Biology.
Threespot damselfish feed mainly on seaweed, but also eat copepods, gastropod molluscs and their eggs, hydroids, marine worms, and sponges.
Adults vigorously maintain large territories, chasing away and nipping intruders, including humans. A male and female will form a breeding pair. The female lays eggs which stick to objects on the seabed, and the male guards these and oxygenates them by fanning them with its fins.

Red Pajamas Records

Red Pajamas Records is an independent American record label. It was founded in 1982 by Chicago singer-songwriter Steve Goodman with help from his manager Al Bunetta. Between 1983 and his death in 1984, Goodman released two albums on Red Pajamas: "Artistic Hair" and "Affordable Art". Two more, "Santa Ana Winds" and the Grammy Award-winning "Unfinished Business", were released posthumously in 1984 and 1987. Red Pajamas Records continues to operate under the management of Oh Boy Records, which is owned by Goodman's friend John Prine. Red Pajamas continues to release archival live performances by Goodman as well as compilations and reissues of his earlier material. The label has also released three recordings of tribute performances by Goodman's friends.
Origin.
Between 1971 and 1980, singer-songwriter Steve Goodman recorded first on the Buddah label, then on Asylum. During this time he wrote and recorded such enduring songs as "City of New Orleans", a 1972 Top 20 hit for Arlo Guthrie and a 1984 #1 Hot Country Single for Willie Nelson; and "You Never Even Call Me By My Name", which was made famous by David Allan Coe in 1974. Following the release of the album "Hot Spot" in 1980, his contract with Asylum ended and Goodman moved to Seal Beach, California. Goodman had been suffering from leukemia for more than ten years, and around this time he came out of remission. Performing was difficult and he wanted to record again, but not with a major label. He decided to create his own label, and Red Pajamas Records was born with the assistance of Goodman's long-time manager Al Bunetta.
Early releases.
For Goodman's first release on Red Pajamas, Bunetta and Dan Einstein edited a series of bootleg live performance tapes. As Goodman's manager, Bunetta had been confiscating these tapes for years from concertgoers who didn't have permission to record Goodman's shows. The resulting album "Artistic Hair" was released in 1983. The title refers to the cover photo, which shows Goodman's chemotherapy-induced hair loss. At first, Red Pajamas Records was a mail-order business, with Goodman and his wife Nancy receiving orders for "Artistic Hair" and shipping copies themselves at a rate of 5 or 6 per day. When Goodman's condition improved he went back into the studio and recorded three more albums. "Affordable Art", with both live and studio cuts, was released in 1983, but then Goodman died in September 1984. "Santa Ana Winds" was released posthumously late in 1984. The appropriately titled "Unfinished Business" was released in 1987, and in 1988 it won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. 
Later releases.
The next two Red Pajamas releases of Goodman's music were compilations drawn from the earlier Asylum material, followed by a two-disc retrospective with both live and studio cuts ("No Big Surprise".) In 1996 "The Easter Tapes" was released, a live album edited from a series of performances taped by DJ Vin Scelsa at New York radio station WNEW-FM in the 1970s. The next five releases were reissues of the Asylum albums from 1975 to 1980. In 2000, another live album of a concert from the 1980s was released ("Live Wire") and critics called it a treasure. In 2003, Red Pajamas released a video containing two of Goodman's performances on the TV program Austin City Limits from 1977 and 1982. The video included interviews with Goodman and others. A 2006 audio release featured Goodman in a 1978 concert at Chicago's Earl of Old Town, and included musicians Corky Siegel on harmonica, Hugh McDonald on bass, Jethro Burns on mandolin, and composer David Amram on pennywhistle and percussion. As of 2008, the latest release is an Extended Play CD titled "The Baseball Singles" containing 4 Goodman songs with baseball-themed lyrics, including "Go, Cubs, Go."
Tributes.
Red Pajamas has produced three tributes featuring friends of Goodman, two on audio and one on video. The first was 1986's "Tribute To Steve Goodman", with Prine, Bonnie Raitt, Fred Holstein, Bonnie Koloc and others. Next was "My Old Man", compiled ten years later by Goodman's daughter Rosanna. The album includes interpretations of Goodman's compositions by her friends Chris Brown, Kate Fenner and others, and includes Rosanna's own delivery of the title tune, which was written by her father Steve about her grandfather Bud. The third tribute is the 2007 DVD "Larger Than Life", a fundraiser for the Old Town School of Folk Music featuring Arlo Guthrie, Lyle Lovett, Jackson Browne, Emmylou Harris and John Prine.

Aristobulus Minor

Aristobulus Minor or Aristobulus the Younger (flourished 1st century BC and 1st century AD, died after 44) was a prince from the Herodian Dynasty. He was of Jewish, Nabataean and Edomite ancestry.
He was the youngest son born to prince Aristobulus IV and princess Berenice of Judea. His parents were first cousins and thus Aristobulus was a grandson to Herod the Great. 
When growing up, he was educated along with his eldest brothers, Agrippa I and Herod of Chalcis in Rome, along with future Roman Emperor Claudius. Claudius and Aristobulus became friends and he became in high favor with the future emperor. Claudius and Aristobulus had sent letters to each other. 
Aristobulus lived at enmity with Agrippa I. Aristobulus denounced Agrippa I and forced him to leave from the protection of Flaccus, the Proconsul of Syria. Agrippa I was charged with bribing the Damascenes to support their cause with the Proconsul against the Sidonians.
Aristobulus married Iotapa, a Syrian Princess from the Royal family of Emesa and daughter of King Sampsiceramus II and Queen Iotapa who ruled Emesa from 14-42. This marriage for Aristobulus was a promising marriage in dynastic terms. Iotapa and Aristobulus chose to live as private citizens in the Middle East. Iotapa and Aristobulus had a daughter called Iotapa, who was deaf and mute. Apart from their daughter, they had no further descendants. 
In the reign of Emperor Caligula 37-41, Aristobulus had opposed the emperor in setting up statues of himself in the Temple in Jerusalem. He survived his brother Agrippa I, who died in 44.

Philip Dorling

Philip Dorling is an author, and was engaged as a Visiting Fellow at the school of Humanities and Social Science in the Australian Defence Force Academy.
Political career.
After successfully completing a doctorate at Flinders University in South Australia, Philip Dorling joined the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1992. Initially employed as a historian, he later took a role in policy – in particular being responsible for issues concerning both arms control and non-poliferation. In 1996, Dorling moved to become an advisor to Laurie Brereton, who at the time was serving as the Australian Labor Party's foreign affairs spokesman. He continued in this post until 2001, and while employed in this role Dorling was "especially engaged in policy relating to Indonesia and East Timorese self-determination". While working with Laurie Brereton, on 16 September 2000, (the first day after the opening of the Sydney Olympics), Dorling's home was raided by the Australian Federal Police on allegations he had leaked confidential information about East Timor to the media. Described in The Sydney Morning Herald as a "political witch hunt", the police were searching for copies of approximately 80 documents, although no evidence was found. After leaving Laurie Brereton's office, Dorling spent two years (2002-2003) working as an advisor to Daryl Melham, the Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs. He was then briefly engaged in the Tasmanian Premier's department in 2003 before moving to the Australian Capital Territory's Chief Minister's department, where he worked until 2008.
Post–politics.
Upon leaving the Chief Minister's department, Dorling was engaged as the National Affairs Correspondent for The Canberra Times. Dorling was, however, once again caught up in controversy when the Australian Federal Police raided Dorling's home on 23 September 2008, after he quoted from classified briefing papers intended for the Australian Minister for Defence, Joel Fitzgibbon. Police reportedly seized "several documents" as a result of their search.

<doc id="20590824" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20590824" title="Spiral array model">
Spiral array model

In music theory, the spiral array model is an extended type of pitch space. It represents human perceptions of pitch, chord and key in the same geometric space, as a mathematical model involving concentric helixes (an "array of spirals"). It was proposed in 2000 by Prof. Elaine Chew in her MIT doctoral thesis "Toward a Mathematical Model of Tonality". Further research by Chew and others have produced modifications of the spiral array model, and, applied it to various problems in music theory and practice, such as key finding and pitch spelling.
The spiral array model can be viewed as an extension of the tonnetz, which maps pitches into a two-dimensional lattice structure. Just like the tonnetz, the spiral array models higher order structures such as chords and keys in the same space as the low level structure: pitches. This allows the spiral array model to produce geometric interpretations of relationships between low and high level structures. For example, you can measure the geometric distance between a particular pitch and a particular key (both represented as points). Like the tonnetz, when applied to equal temperament, the spiral array model folds into a torus as octaves overlap.
Structure of the spiral array.
The model covering basic pitch, major chords, minor chords, major keys and minor keys comprises five concentric helixes. Starting with a formulation of the pitch spiral, inner spirals are generated by a convex combination of points on outer spirals. For example, the pitches C, E, and G are represented as points by the cartesian coordinates C(x,y,z), E(x,y,z) and G(x,y,z). The convex combination formed by the points CEG is a triangle, and represents the "center of effect" of the three pitches. This convex combination represents the triad, or chord, CEG (the C major chord) in the spiral array model. The geometric center (or other point chosen by a weighting of the constituent points, as seen in the equations below) of the C major chord (formed by CEG) can be called the "center" of the C major chord, and assigned a point CM(x,y,z). Similarly, keys may be constructed by the centers of effect of their I, IV, and V chords.
Equations.
The pitch spiral P, is represented in parametric form by:
formula_1
Where k is an integer representing a semitone, r is the radius of the spiral, and h is the "rise" of the spiral
The major chord CM is represented by:
formula_2
where formula_3 and formula_4
The weights "w" effect how close the center of effect are to the fundamental, major third, and perfect fifth of the chord. By changing the relative values of these weights, the spiral array model effects how "close" the resulting chord is to the three constituent pitches. Generally in western music, the fundamental is given the greatest weight in identifying the chord (w1), followed by the fifth (w2), followed by the third (w3).
The minor chord Cm is represented by:
formula_5
where formula_6 and formula_7
The weights "u" function similarly to the major chord.
The major key TM is represented by:
formula_8
where formula_9 and formula_10
Similar to the weights controlling how close constituent pitches are to the center of effect of the chord they produce, the weights "W" control the relative effect of the I, IV, and V chord in determining how close they are to the resultant key.
The minor key Tm is represented by:
formula_11
where formula_12 and formula_13 and formula_14 and formula_15.

Sonny Boy (song)

"Sonny Boy" is a song written by Ray Henderson, Bud De Sylva, and Lew Brown. The hyper-sentimental tearjerker was featured in the 1928 talkie "The Singing Fool". Sung by Al Jolson, the 1928 recording was a hit and stayed at #1 for 12 weeks in the charts and was a million seller.
Lyrics.
Climb up on my knee, Sonny Boy
Though you're only three, Sonny Boy
You've no way of knowing
There's no way of showing
What you mean to me, Sonny Boy.
When there are grey skies,
I don't mind the grey skies.
You make them blue, Sonny Boy.
Friends may forsake me.
Let them all forsake me.
I still have you, Sonny Boy.
You're sent from heaven
And I know your worth.
You made a heaven 
For me here on earth.
When I'm old and grey, dear
Promise you won't stray, dear
For I love you so, Sonny Boy.
When there are grey skies,
I don't mind grey skies.
You make them blue, Sonny Boy.
Friends may forsake me.
Let them all forsake me.
I still have you, Sonny Boy.
You're sent from heaven
And I know your worth. 
You've made a heaven
For me here on earth.
And the angels grew lonely
Took you because they were lonely
I'm lonely too, Sonny Boy.
Eddie Fisher.
Singer Eddie Fisher was always called "Sonny Boy" by his family because of the popularity of this song, which was recorded the same year as Fisher's birth. In his autobiography, Fisher wrote that even after he was married to Elizabeth Taylor in 1959, earning $40,000 a week performing in Las Vegas, spending time with Frank Sinatra and Rocky Marciano, and had songs at the top of the charts, his family still called him "Sonny Boy".
Notable recordings.
Arild Andresen, piano with guitar and bass recorded it in Oslo on March 11, 1955 as the first melody of the medley "Klaver-Cocktail Nr. 4" along with "Top Hat, White Tie and Tails" and "Ain't Misbehavin'. The medley was released on the 78 rpm record His Master's Voice A.L. 3514.
The song has also been recorded by Ruth Etting, The Andrews Sisters and Mandy Patinkin.
The song is used repeatedly in the film "Jacob's Ladder" where it is used to convey a link between Jacob and his dead son Gabe.
Pesach Burstein recorded a Yiddish version (translation by L. Wolfe Gilbert).

IPS/UPS

The IPS/UPS is a wide area synchronous transmission grid of some CIS countries with a common mode of operation and centralized supervisory control. It has an installed generation capacity of 300 gigawatts, and produces 1,200 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year for its 280 million customers. The system spans eight time zones.
History.
The creation of the unified power system started in 1956 by interconnecting the power systems of Center and Middle Volga. By 1978, the unified power system included all of the Soviet Union, excluding Central Asia. In addition, in 1979–1993 the power systems of Poland, German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria, now part of the synchronous grid of Continental Europe (ENTSO-E), operated synchronously with the Unified Power System of USSR. Central Asian countries (excluded Turkmenistan) were included to the integrated system in 2001. In 2009, Uzbekistan disconnected from the system resulting also in the disconnection of Tajikistan.
UPS.
The Russian portion of the interconnection is known as Unified power system of Russia (UPS) () and includes six regional transmission operators: ECO Center, ECO South, ECO North-West, ECO Middle Volga, ECO Urals and ECO Siberia. ECO East operates in isolation from UPS of Russia. 
UPS of Russia came into existence as a result of Russian Federation Decision #526 dated 11 July 2001 "On the Restructuring of the Russian Federation United Energy System". Up until 1 July 2008 RAO UES operated UPS. It is currently being operated by the Federal Grid Company (FGC UES) of Russia.
IPS.
The Integrated Power System (IPS) portion of the network includes the national networks of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Georgia, Moldova and Mongolia.
Interconnections with other systems.
IPS/UPS is synchronously interconnected with the Baltic countries. In addition, it has an interlink to the Nordic system via a back to back High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) connection in Finland with a capacity of 1420 megawatts. Russia and the EU are considering unifying the IPS/UPS network with the ENTSO-E to form a single synchronous super grid spanning 13 time zones.

Hierarchical decision process

The hierarchical decision process (HDP) refines the classical analytic hierarchy process (AHP) a step further in eliciting and evaluating subjective judgements. These improvements, proposed initially by Dr. Jang Ra (a student of Dr. Thomas L. Saaty who developed and refined AHP) include the constant-sum measurement scale (1–99 scale) for comparing two elements, the logarithmic least squares method (LLSM) for computing normalized values, the sum of inverse column sums (SICS) for measuring the degree of (in)consistency, and sensitivity analysis of pairwise comparisons matrices. These subtle modifications address issues concerning normal AHP consistency and applicability in the process of constructing hierarchies: generating criteria, classifying/selecting criteria, and screening/selecting decision alternatives.

The Big 12/Pac-10 Hardwood Series was a four-year series of college basketball games matching teams from the Big 12 Conference and the Pac-10 Conference. Started in 2007 and concluding in 2010, it was primarily a way to guarantee top flight competition for both conferences and garner more recognition for the level of play of both leagues in basketball. This series mirrored the ACC–Big Ten Challenge. There was a "designated" four-day window for the main part of the series matchups and a few other matchups in November and late December. Because there were more teams in the Big 12 at the time, two teams from the Pac-10 played twice against Big 12 teams. The Pac 10 had a slight advantage on the national stage. UCLA (University of California Los Angeles) has 11 national championships, University of Arizona in 1997 & University of Oregon in 1939 The series originally had a 4-year contract which was not renewed by the conferences in 2010, bringing an end to the series.
Results.

Mister Can't You See

"Mister Can't You See" is a song written by Mickey Newbury and Townes Van Zandt that first appeared on Newbury's 1968 debut album "Harlequin Melodies". Newbury's original version was slow and dominated by strings and a very simple drumbeat, with his voice telling a tale of nature's power and beauty. The actual title of the song comes from the line "can't you see the river flowing".
"Mister Can't You see" is best known, however, as recorded by Buffy Sainte-Marie on her 1972 album "Moonshot", where it was the final track and second single.
Owing to a major promotional campaign by Vanguard Records, eager to make up for losses incurred with past Sainte-Marie albums, the label promoted the single vigorously and as a result it became Sainte-Marie's only single "or" album to reach the Top 75 on "Billboard". It peaked at #38 on the Pop Singles chart and #29 on the Adult Contemporary chart.
Sainte-Marie's version is much shorter than Newbury's original and is more straight-ahead rock with the Memphis Horns especially prominent.

The Howard Paradox: Australian Diplomacy in Asia is a 2007 book by Professor Michael Wesley. The book explores whether Australia’s alliance with the United States advances or undermines Australia's relations with Asia. It notes the Howard Government's significant foreign policy successes in the Asia region including close diplomatic relations with Asian leaders and obtaining a seat at the East Asian Summit, which the author says confounded those critical of the early years of the Howard Government. It also examines the impact of John Howard’s "vigorous identification with the West rather than Asia". Discussion of Alexander Downer also features in the book, with his recognition of Australia’s interest in "practical regionalism" not "emotional regionalism".

Dolenz, Jones, Boyce &amp; Hart

Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart was an album released by the group of the same name, released in 1976. The group consisted of Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart. Dolenz and Jones had been members of 1960s pop group/band The Monkees while Boyce and Hart had written many of the group's biggest hits such as "Last Train to Clarksville" and "(Theme from) The Monkees". As such, several publications, such as Allmusic, consider the album to be a Monkees-reunion album. In fact, most of the musicians that appear on this album were featured on Monkees albums in the past. A majority of the vocals are done by Dolenz and Jones ("Right Now", "I Remember The Feeling", "You And I") with Boyce And Hart contributing backing vocals and the occasional lead vocal such as Bobby Hart's on "I Love You I'm Glad That I Said It" Although the album failed to make much of an impact when originally released, renewal of interest in The Monkees led to its reissue on compact disc years later. The group was called Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart because they were legally prohibited from using The Monkees name. Former Monkees members Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork were also invited to join the group, but they both declined.

Dead Skunk

"Dead Skunk" is a 1972 novelty song by Loudon Wainwright III.
The song is musically a simple folk song based on acoustic guitar, but accompanied by drums and strings. The lyrics describe a dead skunk in the middle of a busy road and the smell it produces for pedestrians. Wainwright said the song was an accident, written in 15 minutes.
Although the single was released in November 1972, it was not until well into 1973 that it caught on with radio stations, and its number 16 peak on the Billboard Hot 100 chart was not reached until the week ending 31 March 1973. It was the only record to chart for Wainwright.
The song has been played every Friday near 9 am, on Top 40 radio station KRRY ("Y101") in Quincy, Illinois, since 1985. Y101 disc jockeys Dennis Oliver and Jeffrey Dorsey claim the two have played "Dead Skunk" more than any other radio station in the United States.

Utsumi is a "junkball" pitcher, meaning that he does not have overpowering pitches. His fastball is usually in the 140 km/h (87 MPH) range, and he complements it with a slurve, a changeup, and a forkball. Utsumi relies on his control to get batters out, and it is usually pretty good, but when Utsumi misses his spots, that is when trouble finds him, usually in the form of home runs.

Arthur Schultz

Arthur "Art" Schultz (July 4, 1933 – November 26, 2011) was an American Republican politician. He was a five-term mayor of Joliet, Illinois, the fourth largest municipality in the state after Chicago, Aurora, and Rockford. He was last elected in April 2007. Prior to his first election, he served in the United States Navy and in the Joliet Police Department.
He finished as the first runner-up in the Joliet City Council election of 1989, but when a sitting councilwoman died a few months after the election he was passed over several times for the nomination. This was controversial as the nomination is customarily given to the runner-up in the most recent election. He returned to elective politics to defeat the mayor who did not nominate him in the subsequent election in 1991. 
In his time in office, the Joliet changed from an economy of a prison town with declining population to a fast growing entertainment and tourism economy, focused on riverboat casinos. Residential and commercial construction increased and racing tracks, a baseball stadium, and several civic works developed as a result of the booming economy.
Personal life.
Schultz was born on July 4, 1933 and raised in Joliet. He attended parochial schools in the city, and was an altar boy. Schultz was a graduate of Joliet Catholic High School. After high school, he served four years in the United States Navy during the Korean War. He then worked for the Joliet Police Department for 29 years before being elected mayor in 1991.
Schultz and his wife were married on November 6, 1954 at the Cathedral of St. Raymond in Joliet. As of his 50th wedding anniversary in 2004, Schultz had five children and eight grandchildren.
On November 16, 1993 Schultz had a laryngectomy after having had vocal chord tumors removed the previous May. He lost his voice for a period before regaining it after several months of home recuperation with the aid of a voice prosthesis that was inserted into a neck valve. Schultz suffered congestive heart failure on November 14, 2011, which required hospital care. He died on November 26, 2011, aged 78.
Political career.
Election history.
City Council.
Schultz ran for the election to the Joliet City Council in the spring 1989 municipal elections. He advanced from the February 28, 1989 primary election to the general election in what the "Chicago Tribune" described as a surprisingly strong showing, but finished fourth in the six-way April 4 general election for three seats. 
In August 1989, Joliet Councilwoman Margaret Short died with two years remaining in her term and Joliet Mayor Charles Connor had the responsibility of nominating a replacement for consideration by the remaining councilmen. Rather than following the custom of nominating the first runner-up in the most recent council election (Schultz in this case), Connor nominated a political ally. The council did not support the nomination and after some delay she withdrew on September 19. When Connor's second nomination was again not one of the runners-up, it was again defeated, which led to the council enacting legislation to strip the mayor of his power to nominate councilmen. On October 17, Connor became the first Joliet mayor since the mid-1970s to refuse to sign legislation passed by the Joliet City Council. On November 21, there was unanimous agreement on a compromise candidate who was also not one of the runners-up.
Mayor.
At the time of the non-partisan February 26, 1991 mayoral primary election, the "Chicago Tribune" described Joliet as suffering from a stagnant economy and sagging population. Between 1980 and 1990 the population had declined to 76,836 from 77,956, according to the United States Census Bureau. Connor was challenged by three candidates, including Schultz. Schultz narrowly won the primary election by a 2,709–2,545 (38%–36%) margin over Connor, but both candidates advanced to the April general election since they finished first and second in the primary. On April 2, Schultz defeated Connor by a 6,081–5,534 margin.
Schultz was approved in his re-election bids. In 1995, he earned 67 percent of the vote in the primary election and 68 percent in the general election. He was unopposed in 1999. In 2003, he became the first four-term mayor for Joliet, which was incorporated in 1852, by taking 83% of the vote in a four-way contest. In 2007, he earned 73% of the vote in a three-way contest. He did not run in the 2011 election, and was succeeded by Thomas Giarrante.
Service.
In January 1990, the Illinois legislature passed two bills that permitted gambling along the Mississippi, Illinois, and Des Plaines Rivers. but gambling did not commence in Joliet until June 17, 1992. In January 1993 Schultz described Joliet as "the riverboat-gambling capital of the world". In 1995 Joliet officials expected the town to be debt free by 2001 with Schultz described the sizable gambling industry revenues as "manna from Heaven" and encouraged other cities to try legalized gambling. Between 1993 and 1997 Schultz received US$1,500 in gambling-related political contributions.
During the 1990s, Joliet was one of the fastest growing cities in the state, and in 2000 its residential and commercial construction were at record-setting levels, according to Schultz. Schultz also credited gambling revenues with having enabled the city to halt tax increases for a decade and to build a new police station and three new firehouses. In 1999, the Joliet City Council approved the construction of the Chicagoland Speedway on of land next to the Route 66 Raceway. Between 2000 and 2002 Joliet was the tenth fastest growing city in the United States. Under Schultz, the city ended nearly 150 years as a prison town with the closure of the Joliet Correctional Center and focused its economy on entertainment and tourism.
In the early 1990s the city annexed for the construction of the Empress Riverboat Casino complex. In 1999, the city annexed for the construction of the Chicagoland Speedway, which when combined with the Route 66 Raceway made Joliet the only racing facility host in the United States capable of hosting races from each major category in professional auto racing. In 2001, the city acquired 12 parcels totaling through expedited condemnations to build Silver Cross Field. In 2005, the city annexed to provide a corridor for commercial and residential growth. As of the July 1, 2007 United States Census Bureau population estimates, Joliet had a population of 144,316. Thus, Schultz served as mayor for a city that ranked as the 162nd largest incorporated municipality in the United States and the fourth largest in the state of Illinois.
Silver Cross Field, which was built in 2002 to host the Joliet Jackhammers of the Northern League is located at 1 Mayor Art Schultz Drive. By 2007, prospects of continued growth necessitated that Joliet agree on borders with the neighboring municipality of Oswego and that it consider future borders with others.

Heart of Hajduk Award

Heart of Hajduk () is an annual football award established in 1994 and officially awarded by the Hajduk Split supporters' association Torcida Split to the Hajduk player of the year, e.g. the team's best performing player during the season. 
The inaugural winner of the award was midfielder Ante Miše, a key player in the squad which won the Croatian championship in the 1993–94 season. Two players have won the award twice - striker Nenad Pralija in 1995 and 1996, and goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa in 2000 and 2002. As of 2012, only three foreign players received the award (Josip Skoko in 1998, Mirko Hrgović in 2007 and Senijad Ibričić in 2010), although they all hold Croatian citizenship. Hrgović was originally Croatian but had made a name for himself playing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he was given citizenship and was called up to play for the national side, while Skoko is a Croatian Australian.
In 2006 the title wasn't awarded because, according to supporters' judgment, none of the players deserved it following a string of bad results in both domestic competitions which saw Hajduk, widely considered a powerhouse in Croatian football, finishing fifth in the national championship and exiting the 2005–06 Croatian Cup in the semi-finals.
In 2009 the club had initially struggled to find their form, but improved later in the season and eventually finished second in the championship and runners-up in the 2008–09 Croatian Cup (after coming back from a 3–0 defeat to their biggest rivals Dinamo Zagreb in the first leg and then losing the final in a penalty shootout). The supporters' frustration with yet another trophiless season was further increased when Hajduk went through much turmoil related to the transformation of the debt-ridden club into a public limited company in the summer of 2009. In addition, the team experienced a series of humiliating results at the beginning of the 2009–10 season, and this all led to the cancellation of the award for the second time since its establishment. On 11 August 2011, the award was posthumously awarded to legendary Hajduk manager Tomislav Ivić who died in June 2011. In August 2012, Heart of Hajduk was awarded to the youth academy.

Malibu Locals Only

Malibu Locals Only (also known as "MLO") is a group of youths local to Malibu, California, who have been associated with several violent attacks along with other criminal activity in the city. Frequently involved with party, bar or beach area fights, the group has maintained a feeling of aversion toward residents of the San Fernando Valley region, as well as other outsiders who find their way into Malibu for recreation or leisure. Currently, they are considered to be an unorganized group of an estimated 10 to 15 people, who are often criticized by former MLO members for their attacks on innocent people, rather than operating on the original goals of the organization. They are considered wimps.
Origins.
Initially established in the 1960s by a group of Malibu surfers, the group sought to do two things; stop the San Fernando Valley surfers from using their beaches (which were at the time, private), and protect students of Malibu who were the minority in High Schools at the time (because Malibu High School had not yet been constructed). The group began to graffiti the letters "MLO", which eventually became the name by which the group was referenced, and Malibu Locals Only was born.
Current activity.
Today, the gang has been responsible for multiple instances of brutality. The gang has also been involved in many encounters with Pepperdine University students, frequently at the Malibu Inn. 
Despite the fact that the Malibu Locals Only gang has met the criteria of a criminal gang, as defined by the STEP (Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention) Act passed by the California state legislature, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (the agency contracted by the city of Malibu to perform law enforcement duties) has continued to deny that the group is a criminal gang. This has upset many people, as the organization has continued their criminal activity, affecting outsiders visiting the seaside city.

Ioannis Pangas

Ioannis Pangas or Bangas (, 1814–1895) was a wealthy Greek merchant and philanthropist. He donated vast sums of money to the Greek state, as well as to educational, cultural and humanitarian institutions of the Greek communities in Greece and the Ottoman ruled Greek world.
Life.
He was born in a Greek family in Ottoman Korce, present-day southern Albania (Northern Epirus). Though his father Georgios Pangas was also a notable merchant and philanthropist, Ioannis Pangas made his own fortune. He initially moved to Thebes and then to Chalkis. At 1833 in order to expand his professional activities, he moved to Cairo (Egypt) and then Romania. At a mature age he settled in Athens. Because of his character and hard-working nature he managed to make a fortune.
Benefactory deeds and legacy.
In 1889–88 he donated a significant amount of money for the maintenance and expansion of the Greek schools in his home city Korce, where he also established new libraries and donated a huge amount of educational material at his personal expense. Thus, he became one of the main contributors of the Lasso fund, a community fund that supported the foundation and support of Greek cultural institutions in Korce. The Greek Gymnasium of his home town was named Bangas Gymnasium after him.
While living in Athens, he built a luxurious mansion, designed by the German architect Ernst Ziller, at the center of the Greek capital (on Omonoia square) as well as a second manor, also designed by Ziller, adjacent to his home. On 16 August 1889, Pangas donated to the Greek state his fortune and all of his possessions, as an act of philanthropy to aid the rebuilding of Athens and the growth of the new Greek state. He retained only 1,000 drachmas per month in order to lead a decent life. This form of benefaction was quite unusual, to offer to donate one's fortune while living rather than upon death. Greek prime minister Charilaos Trikoupis personally noted the significance of Pangas's philanthropy.
Pangas's mansion and adjacent manor still stand at Omonoia square. The former operated for many years as the Hotel Alexander the Great. The latter came to be known as the "Pangeion" or "Bangeion" or "Baggeion" () and has been used to house universities and other educational institutions.

Azhakiya Ravanan

Azhakiya Ravanan (English: "Popinjay") is a 1996 Malayalam film directed by Kamal and written by Sreenivasan. Starring Mammootty, Bhanupriya, Sreenivasan, Innocent, Biju Menon, Rajan P. Dev, and Cochin Haneefa. The music is composed by Vidyasagar. The film is a rag-to-riches story of Shankar Das (Mammootty) who eventually gets drunk on his success. 
Plot.
Shankar Das (Mammootty) is a rich businessman who returns to his native village in (Alappuzha). No one in the village is aware of his past. During his childhood he was a servant of the local feudal lord Chatothu Panickar (Rajan P. Dev). He left the job after getting severely punished for kissing the lord's young daughter. He fled to Mumbai and there he became a successful businessman. 
Now he has returned to his native village incognito. He is a very boastful man and revels in the praises showered on him by the sycophants. He reveals his identity to Ambujakshan (Sreenivasan), who is his childhood friend and an aspiring writer. He also confides in him his interest for Panicker's daughter Anuradha (Bhanupriya), who was his childhood infatuation. Ambujakshan succeeds in convincing Shankar to produce a film by telling him that it would help him to earn the respect of the villagers and win over Anuradha. Thus the production of the film starts under the direction of Sharath (Biju Menon), who is the love interest of Anuradha.
Shankar renders unsolicited financial help to Panicker's family. But, Shankar later realizes about the love developing between Anuradha and Sharath the film director and that leads to a pause on the film's production. Later, Shankar proposes marriage to Anuradha, which she declines. However, the family which is indebted to him coerces her to marry him. Anuradha, who is infuriated, decides that she will not present herself as a virgin before Shankar and makes love with Sharath. After the marriage she learns from Shankar that Sharath had accepted money from him for not creating any trouble for their marriage. This causes another heartbreak for her and she confesses about her relationship with Sharath to Shankar. In the end Shankar forgives Anuradha and their marital relationship resumes.
Themes.
The film was also a satirical take on the Malayalam film industry. It depicted how rich business men, who are craving for fame, are entrapped by struggling writers and directors to produce films. This phenomenon resulted in the churning out of mediocre films that lack artistic quality and commercial feasibility. The film also showed how money alone cannot win love and how money corrupts love.
Soundtrack.
The music of the film was composed by Vidyasagar. This movie marked Vidyasagar's entry into Malayalam films. The songs were very popular. Especially the song "Vennila Chandana Kinnam", evokes nostalgic feelings. Lyrics are written by Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri. The soundtrack of this film won Vidyasagar the Kerala State Film Award for best Music.

Schloß Wolfsgarten

Schloß Wolfsgarten is a former hunting seat of the ruling family of Hesse-Darmstadt, located in the German state of Hessen, approximately 15 kilometers south of Frankfurt am Main. The hunting lodge was established between 1722 and 1724 by Landgrave Ernst Ludwig of Hesse-Darmstadt. Ernst Ludwig's purpose in establishing Wolfsgarten was to pursue his passion for hunting with dogs which he introduced into Hesse in 1709. The original building corresponded to the usual pattern for hunting seats of that era with a rectangular yard around which was grouped housing for gentlemen, the stables for the houses, and kennels for the dogs. After Ernst Ludwig's successors abandoned hunting with dogs in 1768, Wolfsgarten was abandoned until the 1830s when the grand ducal family began to restore and expand the property. From 1879, Wolfsgarten became a favorite country retreat for Grand Dukes Ludwig IV and his son Ernst Ludwig.
In the twentieth century, Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig extensively modernized Schloß Wolfsgarten and rearranged its park. After the abolition of the monarchy in 1918, Wolfsgarten became the principal residence of the former grand ducal family. Today, Schloß Wolfsgarten is the property of the Hessian House Foundation (Hessische Hausstiftung), the family trust that holds ownership to the property belonging to all branches of the House of Hesse. The property is open to the public only on two weekends in May during the annual Rhododendrenblüte (Rhododendron festival) and again for a weekend in September for the The Schloss Wolfsgarten Garden Festival.

<doc id="20591657" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20591657" title="Chloroacetyl chloride">
Chloroacetyl chloride

Chloroacetyl chloride is a chlorinated acyl chloride. It is a bifunctional compound, making it a useful building block chemical.
Production.
Industrially, it is produced by the carbonylation of methylene chloride, oxidation of vinylidene chloride, or the addition of chlorine to ketene. It may be prepared from chloroacetic acid and thionyl chloride, phosphorus pentachloride, or phosgene.
Reactions.
Chloroacetyl chloride is bifunctional—the acyl chloride easily forms esters and amides, while the other end of the molecule is able to form other linkages, e.g. with amines. The use of chloroacetyl chloride in the synthesis of lidocaine is illustrative:
Applications.
The major use of chloroacetyl chloride is as an intermediate in the production of alachlor and butachlor; an estimated 100 million pounds are used annually. Some chloroacetyl chloride is also used to produce phenacyl chloride, another chemical intermediate, also used as a tear gas. Phenacyl chloride is synthesized in a Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene, with an aluminium chloride catalyst:
Safety.
Like other acyl chlorides, reaction with other protic compounds such as amines, alcohols, and water generates hydrochloric acid, making it a lachrymator.
There is no regulated permissible exposure limit set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. However, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit at 0.05 ppm over an eight-hour work day.

Maria Gatland

Maria Gatland (born 1948, Dublin, Ireland), is a councillor in the London Borough of Croydon for the Conservative Party. She is also a former Council cabinet member for education, a post she resigned from after being exposed as a former member of the Irish Republican Army (IRA),
Early life.
Gatland was born Maria McGuire, to a middle-class family, and lived in the suburb of Churchtown, Dublin. She was one of four siblings (two brothers and a sister). She was educated at St. Anne's School and then University College Dublin, where she studied English language and literature.
IRA involvement.
McGuire became a member of the IRA in the early 1970s. She moved in the upper echelons of the organisation and had an affair with Dáithí Ó Conaill (later a Continuity IRA chief-of-staff), whom she accompanied to the European continent on an arms buying expedition. The expedition came to nothing because it was reported in the British Press and Conaill and McGuire abandoned the mission.
After an IRA bomb went off on Bloody Friday in Belfast killing nine and maiming over 100, McGuire decided to leave the IRA. She was told by the authorities if she did so she would receive Special Branch protection. In the late summer of 1972 she appeared in London and wrote a series of articles for "The Observer", went into hiding, and wrote a book about her experiences in the organisation called "To Take Arms, A Year in the Provisional IRA" which was published in 1973.
Political career.
In 2002 Maria Gatland was elected as a member of the Conservative Party to Croydon Council as a councillor for Croham ward and in 2006 became Croydon's cabinet member for education. She says that she never hid her past, but membership of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, did not appear on her CV. When the Conservative Party found out about her Republican past she stepped down as a council cabinet member in early December 2008. At the same time Gatland was suspended by the party, but was later accepted back to the Tory fold.
Personal life.
Around 1986 McGuire moved to Croydon where she met and married her late husband Mervyn Gatland, who ran a garden maintenance business. Gatland has said that at this time she was very fragile and had two breakdowns.

Kunwar Narayan

Kunwar Narain (कुँवर नारायण) (born 19 September 1927) is a poet and a presence in Indian literature, often regarded as the leading living poet in Hindi. He has read and traveled widely, written over the last six decades and is among the few intellectuals who combine an international modern sensibility with a grounding in their country’s cultural and imaginative history. Linked to the New Poetry movement, he publishes selectively and is characteristically polite. He read English literature and publishes in Hindi but also plays with English and Urdu. Earlier, he lived in Lucknow where his house was a centre of literary meets and classical performances. He now lives in with his wife and son. Influences on him have been diverse, from the Indian epics and Upanishads to Kabir and Amir Khusro, history and mythology to Buddhism and Marxism, Kafka and Cavafy to Ghalib and Gandhi.
Life.
Born on 19 September 1927, in Faizabad district, Uttar Pradesh Kunwar Narayan passed his M.A. examination in English Literature from Lucknow University in 1951. Married to Bharati Goenka in 1966, he has a son Apurva, born in 1967.
Political leaders Narendra Deva and Acharya Kriplani were key literary influences and he gives formative importance to his first visit to Europe, Russia and China in 1955 and meetings with poets like Nazim Hikmet Ran, Anton Słonimskie and Pablo Neruda. Later, his translations of the French symbolist poets like Mallarmé and Valery, and then of poets like Cavafy and Borges, contributed to his poetic development. His work covers varied genres—poetry, epic poetry, short stories, literary criticism, translations, essays on world cinema, history and Indian classical music, and articles of versatile cultural and human interest. He has been translated nationally and internationally, and his many honours include the Jnanpith Award, Sahitya Akademi Award, Kabir Samman, Vyasa Samman, Lohia Samman, Shalaka Samman, Warsaw University’s honorary medal and Italy’s Premio Feronia for distinguished international author (a prestigious honour given for the first time to an Indian writer and previously awarded to authors like Germany’s Günter Grass, South Africa’s J. M. Coetzee, China’s Gao Xingjian, Syria’s Adonis, Cuba’s Roberto F Retamar, Palestine’s Mahmoud Darwish, Iraq’s Saadi Youssef, France’s Michel Butor and Albania’s Ismail Kadaré).
Work.
His oeuvre began with "Chakravyūh", his first poetry collection published in 1956, a landmark in Hindi literature. About the same time, he co-edited "Yug-Chétnā", an avant-garde literary magazine. A little later in 1959, he was one of the poets in "Tīsrā Saptak" edited by Agyeya. In 1961, his second poetry collection "Parivésh: Hum-Tum" came. "Ātmajayee", published in 1965, a short epic based on the Upanishadic character of Nachiketā, expresses some of the most fundamental metaphysical concerns and is widely recognised as a classic of Hindi literature.
His short story collection "Ākāron Ke Ās-Pās" came in 1971 and is a lasting example of a poetic mind exploring the genre of fiction. In the poems of "Apné Sāmné" (1979), contemporary political and social ironies found a more pronounced place. After a long hiatus, his much-awarded collection of poems "Koī Dūsrā Nahīn" was published in 1993. "Āj Aur Āj Sé Pahlé", a collection of literary criticism (1999), "Méré Sākshātkār", a collection of interviews (2000) and "Sāhitya Ké Kuchh Antar-Vishayak Sandarbh" (2003), as also journals like "Yug Chétna", "Naya Pratik" and "Chhayanat" that he co-edited, and writings on cinema, art and history, reveal yet other aspects of his literary repertoire. In 2002, the poetry collection "In Dino" was published and, in 2008, his latest work, an epic poem "Vājashravā Ké Bahāné", has appeared, which while recalling the contextual memory of "Ātmajayī" published forty years ago, is a chain of independent island-like poems. A selection of his poems in English translation, "No Other World", by his son Apurva has appeared in 2010 from Rupa.
Works.
Compilations.
Poems, stories, essays, criticism, and writings on cinema, music, art and history, have also appeared in journals and anthologies. Works on the poet and translations into national and international languages have been published in journals, anthologies and independent collections.

Jack Redden

Jack Redden (born 9 December 1990) is an Australian rules football player for the Brisbane Lions.
Originally from Keith, South Australia, he is the brother of Tom Redden who was once on the Rookie List of the Adelaide Crows. After attending Sacred Heart College, Redden was selected with the Brisbane Lions' second selection (pick 25 overall) in the 2008 National Draft.
Redden was given the number 30 jumper, previously worn by former Brisbane dual-premiership player Robert Copeland.
AFL career.
2009.
Redden made his senior debut in Round 15 2009 against Geelong, kicking one goal. He remained in the Brisbane side for the remainder of the season, including two finals series matches.
2010.
Redden was one of few Brisbane players to have played in all 22 game season for the Brisbane Lions in 2010.
Redden was the third player (after Todd Banfield and Tom Rockliff) from the Brisbane Lions to have earned a NAB Rising Star nomination in 2010, an award which recognises the standout performers of the AFL who are of 21 years of age or younger and played 10 games before the conclusion of the current season. Redden ended up losing out to Sydney youngster Daniel Hannebery. Redden earned his nomination afer what was said to be an "outstanding" performance in a narrow loss against St Kilda.
Alongside his 4 goals, Redden also took 114 marks and had an average of 17 disposals per game. In his second season, he led Brisbane in tackles (with 115) and was ranked third in the club for inside-50s (with 73).
In the end of year Club Champion Award, Redden ended up with a 5th placed finish with a grand total of 26.5 votes.
2011.
2011 has been considered Redden's breakout season, playing some of his best football. Redden's kicked 14 goals in his 22 matches this season. Redden has also had a career-high 32 disposals v Carlton in round 12 and Hawthorn in round 16, a season-high 9 marks v Sydney in round 11 and Collingwood in round 22 and a career-high 13 tackles v Fremantle in round 1 and Port Adelaide in round 15. Redden totalled 166 tackles for the season (ranked 5th for the season and having the 3rd highest average), having the most tackles of players not to have played in the finals. This caused Redden to be ranked 9th on the all-time list of most tackles in a season since statistics for tackles have been counted.
Redden is said to play a crucial role in the current re-building process which the Brisbane Lions team is undertaking. In this reference, Redden is listed alongside Tom Rockliff, Todd Banfield and Daniel Rich who are considered important to the re-building process. Teammate Matthew Leuenberger is also another player who is excited by the future of Redden and co.
Redden has not missed a game since his debut in round 15, 2009. 
Redden was listed to be Brisbane's most underrated player in a club-by-club analysis of the most underrated players by Fox Sports journalists John Clark and Paul Pickering. Redden was noted to "rarely earn the plaudits as peers Daniel Rich and Tom Rockliff".
With club legend Simon Black considered to be on the back-end of his career, Redden was also considered to be one of the players which could take over the role. In an interview after Brisbane's loss to Richmond in round 13, Redden said "it'll be big shoes to fill when Blacky (Simon Black) does leave... but most definitely I would love to take that spot in the team" but yet admits "there's plenty of other boys that have the potential to do that". In the article, Whiting said Redden has a "hunger for the contested footy" and is a "composed young player with strong hands overhead and a great work ethic".
Redden ranked 3rd in the Brisbane best and fairest awards (otherwise known as the Merrett-Murray Medal) in 2011 with 35 votes, finishing only 2.5 votes behind winner Tom Rockliff and half a vote behind runner-up Simon Black. Because of his third place finish, Redden won the Alistair Lynch trophy. Also, Redden was announced as being the most courageous player for Brisbane in the year, winning him the Shaun Hart Most Courageous Player award.
Redden also polled his first Brownlow Medal vote this year, the award which rewards the AFL's fairest and best player. However, Redden was ineligible this year after being reprimanded for tripping Gold Coast player Gary Ablett. Redden polled the vote in his 27 disposal, 2 goal and 12 tackle effort v St Kilda in round 5.

MKER

The MKER (: "Mnogopetlevoy Kanalynyi Energeticheskiy Reaktor", translation: "multi-loop pressure tube power reactor"), is a development of the RBMK nuclear power reactor. It is a Russian third generation nuclear reactor design.
Operation.
The MKER is a pressure tube reactor with modern safety features including containment and passive safety systems. Fuel can be changed while the reactor is in operation, improving grid and fuel efficiency. Vertical injectors promote a natural convective flow of the light water primary circuit fluid through inlined channels in the reactor core. Graphite blocks in the reactor core serve as a neutron moderator.
There are three different types of MKER: the MKER-800, MKER-1000 and MKER-1500. No MKER of any type has yet been completed.
MKER-800.
The MKER-800 has an electrical generation capacity of 800 MW. An automated process control system for the MKER-800 is under development in a joint project of Westinghouse and NIKIET. Plans for the MKER-800 remain unfinished. Four MKER-800 units were originally planned for the Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant.
MKER-1000.
The MKER-1000 has a thermal power output of 2845 MWth and an electrical output of 1,000 MW. There are four circuits and 1,832 fuel elements in the reactor core. Total fissile material in the reactor is 163 tonnes. Overall responsibility for construction of the MKER design is held by Northern Construction Administration. Major assemblies are produced by the Izhorsky Zavod in Saint Petersburg, and the turbine supplier is the Leningradsky Metallichesky Zavod. Main building and reactor containment is designed by Atomenergoproekt. The MKER is intended to directly substitute for existing RBMK plants producing heat, electricity and medical isotopes. 
The reactor building of the MKER consists of a dual containment structure with an inner diameter of 27.75 meters. An inner liner intended to prevent leakage of radioactive material into the atmosphere can withstand internal pressures of 2.5 bar. Protection from external damage is provided by an outer concrete wall. The two structures are independent and separated physically from one another on a common foundation. Damage from an earthquake of formula_1 8 would be contained by this structure.
Automatic control is an integral part of the MKER design. Located between the reactor building and the turbine hall, the control room oversees the automatic control system and various plant safety systems. It occupies a protected central location, minimizing possibility of damage or compromise. 
The MKER-1000 core includes the pressure tube reactor and eight coolant injector pumps. There are multiple coolant loops with 16 independent circuits, two circuits sharing a pump each. From an overall thermal capacity of 3,000 MWth electrical generation of 1,000 MW plus an additional 130 MW of thermal energy for building heat can be obtained. The design specified turbine is a type K-1000-6, 1 / 3000 at 3000 rpm with an alternator of type TZV-1100-2UZ. Both evaporative cooling and open cycle cooling variations have been proposed.
Low-enriched uranium dioxide fuel with concentrations of 2.0 to 2.4% U-235 equivalence is specified. Fuel is changed using a remote-controlled crane and spent fuel rods would spend up to five years in a cooling pond located in the reactor hall before further processing. The continuous refuelling cycle brings a fuel burnup benefit; individual rods can be left longer in the reactor instead of being swapped en masse as required in most PWR designs.
MKER-1500.
A further proposed development of the MKER is the MKER-1500 or RBMK-1500 with a corresponding electrical generation capacity of 1500 MW. Transfer of heat from the reactor core has been improved in the new design, with primary loops divided into four independent circuits. The diameter of the coolant tubes is expanded to 600 mm and injector pump configuration is changed. Cooling circuits are relocated below the containment. The MKER-1500 was also proposed for the Leningrad nuclear power plant.

2009 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team

The 2009 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team was the third under head coach Tim Brewster. They began play on September 5, 2009, at Syracuse, a member of the Big East Conference. On September 12, the Minnesota opened the new TCF Bank Stadium with a 20–13 win against Air Force, moving from the Metrodome, which had been their home stadium since 1982. The Golden Gophers finished the season 6–7 and 3–5 in Big Ten play and lost 13–14 to Iowa State in the Insight Bowl. Despite the worse overall record, the Golden Gophers only suffered two blowout losses in the 2009 season (20-0 to Penn State and 38–7 to Ohio State), compared to 3 in 2008 (55–0 to Iowa, 42–21 to Kansas, 29–6 to a 3–9 Michigan team, and one could possibly also include a 34–21 loss to Ohio State that was 34–6 until the Buckeye reserves came in).
Preseason.
The Golden Gophers came off a 7–6 season after starting 7–1, capped by an appearance in the 2008 Insight Bowl. On January 6, offensive coordinator Mike Dunbar resigned and defensive coordinator Ted Roof left Minnesota for Auburn. On January 9, former Nebraska defensive coordinator Kevin Cosgrove was hired as the co-defensive coordinator, a position he will share with Ronnie Lee. On January 21, Jedd Fisch was named the offensive coordinator. He had previously been the wide receivers coach for the Denver Broncos.

Martin Swan

Martin Swan (born Sheffield, England) is a Scottish multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, composer, record producer, recording engineer and instrument designer. 
Swan is best known as the leader of the Mouth Music project, whose combination of traditional Gaelic songs and music with contemporary instrumental and technological settings led them to international fame and number 1 placings in world music sales charts in the early 1990s. His multi-instrumental skills and his approach towards the making of folk music (eclectic, restless and frequently non-purist) has seen him compared to a folk music version of Prince.
Swan is also involved in the restoration, manufacture and design of string instruments.
Though born in England, Swan is of Scottish descent and identifies as Scottish.
Musical abilities.
Martin Swan is known to play the following instruments:
Swan also sings (mostly backing vocals, but more recently lead vocals) and whistles, and is a skilled musical arranger.
Musical projects.
Mouth Music.
Swan has been the only consistent member of the musical project Mouth Music since its inception in 1988. Initially an equal partner with singer Talitha MacKenzie, he asserted control over the project following disagreements with MacKenzie and her subsequent departure in 1991 (MacKenzie has continued to challenge Swan's view of the "Mouth Music" concept). Since then Swan has presided over a variety of lineups, working with musicians including Capercaillie/Shooglenifty drummer James Mackintosh, pipe/flute/fiddle player Martyn Bennett, fiddler Alison Crawford and singers Jackie Joyce (aka Helicopter Girl), Martin Furey, Mairi McInnes, Ishbel MacAskill and Michaela Rowan. Over the course of six albums and one EP, Mouth Music’s music has spanned a wide variety of styles from traditional Celtic music to worldbeat, funk, electronic dance, "fiddle fusion" and more.
Ambisonic.
Swan was half of the electronic pop duo Ambisonic (alongside singer Jackie Joyce), who released one album, "Ecohero" on Nation Records in 1997. The project was a spin-off from the third Mouth Music lineup, in which Joyce was lead singer and Swan's main co-writer and creative foil.
Kries.
Swan plays fiddle for the Croatian band Kries (led by ex-Legen frontman Mojmir Novakovic). He appears on the band’s second album "Kocijani" (which he also produced and mixed).
Stobo Village Band.
In 2008, Swan began working with the Stobo Village Band, which is described as playing “fast hypnotic acoustic dance music with fiddle, pipes, accordion, tapan and darabuka, mashing up Scottish/Irish tune playing with the virtuoso traditions of eastern Europe and the Balkans.” The band’s line-up is Martin Swan (fiddle), Lewis Powell-Reid (accordion, guitar), Ross Ainslie (whistle, pipes, cittern), James Mackintosh (percussion) and Fraser Watson (percussion), Mackintosh has previously worked with Swan in Mouth Music.
The band made their public debut on January 16, 2008 (at the Celtic Connections concert series in Glasgow) and have continued to play ceilidhs around the Scottish Borders region.
Zykopops.
In 2010, Martin Swan started a "trash folk" band called Zykopops, based in Croatia. Their first live performance was in Zagreb, in October 2010. The band's slogan ("Zykopops... worse than Turbofolk!") is apparently already gaining them notoriety throughout the Balkans. Zykopops rework classic and obscure traditional songs from Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia and Hungary using a punk- and hip-hop-inflected style which they call ""rakija music"" and which includes ""Ramones tempos and Hajduk virtuoso nonsense."" The group's stated aim is to ""achieve a state of rabbit-ness and to infect others with equal rabbit-ness."" Swan plays violin in the band, which is fronted by Lidija Dokuzovic and also features hip-hoppers Erol Zejnilovic and Konrad Lovrencic, along with ""a random crew of percussionists, beatboxers and physical therapists"" including Nenad Kovacic and Ante
Prgin-Surka.
Selected work as producer and engineer.
In 1998, Swan remixed Martyn Bennett's "Bothy Culture" album.
In 2003, Swan produced and engineered Martin Furey's debut solo album "Howl" (on which he also played guitar using Furey’s invention, the Varichord capo).
In 2006, Swan produced and engineered Nuru Kane's widely-admired "Sigil" album (on which he also played violin and accordion).
In 2007, Swan produced and mixed the second Kries album "Kocijani" (released in 2008).
Work in instrument restoration and design.
In the mid 1990s Swan moved to the Scottish Borders and developed a second career as a woodworker (carpenter, cabinet maker and violin restorer). After cutting off the top of a finger with a woodworking machine in 2008, he decided to give up the large-scale carpentry and concentrate on restoring old violins. He soon became fascinated and exasperated by the variations in tonal quality of old violins and started researching the methods of Eastern European violin makers. This led to him designing a range of handmade violins, violas and cellos, travelling to Transylvania to choose tonewood and developing friendships with the Hungarian luthiers who now make the instruments for him.

Rafflesia baletei

Rafflesia baletei is a parasitic plant species of the genus "Rafflesia". It is endemic to the Philippines.
The species was first collected in 1991 by Bicolano mammalogist Danilo S. Balete on Mount Isarog and was initially thought to be "Rafflesia manillana". It was only in 2006 that Filipino scientists confirmed the identity of this new species, naming it in Balete's honour. After the establishment of the identity of this species, a new population was rediscovered on Mount Isarog and Mount Iriga. See this citation for a review of Philippine "Rafflesia".

Robert S. Beightler

Robert Sprague Beightler (March 21, 1892 – February 12, 1978) was an American military officer and Ohio political insider, engineer, and business owner. In the military, he reached the rank of major general, and served as military Governor of Okinawa, War Department General Staff, and as commander of the 37th Infantry Division, the only National Guard General to lead his troops through training and into battle during World War Two. In political activities in Ohio, he served as head of the Ohio State Highway Department, President of the Army Personnel Board, Executive Director and board member of the Ohio Turnpike Commission.
Beightler was the only World War II National Guard general to have commanded his division for the length of the war. In addition to being one of only eleven generals who commanded their divisions for the entire war and the longest serving of these eleven, Beightler was appointed to the regular army in 1946 as one of only two National Guard major generals to receive such an appointment at that time.
Surname etymology.
Beightler is derived from Bigler. Because some German immigrants were illiterate when they came to Colonial America, the name has been transcribed numerous ways by English clerks not familiar with the ethnic surnames and anglicized, including Beighler, Beigler, and Beegler. The "t" was added to the name upon the arrival of Robert's ancestor in Marysville because of how the name sounded, where his ancestors were said to have spoken with a strong German accent which was barely understandable. The traditional pronunciation of the name is "Beat-ler", reflective of the origins of the name, and is still used by many descendants of Robert's Marysville ancestor Tobias, however, other descendants have adopted the evolutionary pronunciation, "Bite-ler".
Early life.
Beightler was born on March 21, 1892 in Marysville, Ohio, of German-British-French descent. He was the son of William P. Beightler, an elected local surveyor, city and state engineer. His father was also the president of the Perfect Cigar Company. His mother was Joana Sprague, daughter of Franklin B. Sprague and a cousin of Cdre. Oliver Hazard Perry, Gov. William Sprague IV, and U.S. Senator William Sprague III.
Beightler's paternal ancestors came from Germany, having immigrated to and settled in Berks County, Pennsylvania in the 18th century. In the early 19th century, those ancestors were some of the first pioneers of the western United States, first settling in eastern Ohio, and eventually in Marysville. They had served in the American Revolution, and would serve as well in the American Civil War, among other early United States conflicts.
Beightler was raised in a Protestant home that stressed church, community, service, duty, and patriotism. They lived on the westside of Marysville on 7th street. As a young man he learned from his father's industriousness and grew vegetables in the back yard to sell door to door. He was an excellent student, and avid hunter, having been quoted saying "from the time I was knee high to a grasshopper, (I had a rifle in my hands)."
Education.
After graduating from Marysville High School in 1909, he enrolled at The Ohio State University for two years. While there he studied civil engineering, was active is Sigma Alpha Epsilon, trained as a cadet, and was manager of the basketball team. Following the two years at OSU, Beightler left to take employment as an assistant engineer with Union County.
Marriage.
While he was in college, he met his future wife Anna Lawrence Porter, who was a student at Ohio Wesleyan University. Her father was an executive with the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company, and her grandfather was a judge in Union County. They would marry on October 14, 1914 and have three children, two who lived, Robert Jr., and Marjorie. Beightler's best man at this wedding was John W. Bricker, the future Governor of Ohio, U.S. Senator, and 1944 Republican Vice Presidential Nominee.
Military service.
National Guard enlistment.
On August 7, 1911, Beightler had enlisted with the Ohio National Guard. He was part of the 4th Ohio Infantry, which had been re-organized from the 14th Ohio National Guard. Beightler served with Company E, based out of an armory in Marysville. By 1913 Beightler had achieved the rank of first sergeant, and second lieutenant by 1914.
Mexican Conflict.
In August 1916, President Woodrow Wilson mobilized 400,000 troops from across the nation, including from the Ohio National Guard, to be sent to the Mexican border to deal with the border crisis and Pancho Villa. The forces were led by John J. Pershing. A young Beightler would serve in this conflict.
World War One.
On August 5, 1917, Beightler was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army, serving as an adjutant for the 3rd Battalion. The 4th infantry would be designated the 166th U.S Infantry Regiment by the U.S. War Department. Beightler would be moved to Camp Mills on Long Island in preparation for deployment to France in the European theater of World War I.
Before departing for Europe in October 1917, Anne would visit to wish Robert well and inform him that they were expecting their first child. Upon arriving in France, Beightler's regiment undertook basic training operations, including learning the French language. He would be involved in the Sedan incident, as well as other combat during his time stationed in France.
Post-World War One civilian life.
Following the war, he returned home to Ohio in 1919. Re-entering civilian life, he worked as an engineer for the state in Columbus over requests by his father to work in Union County as an engineer. His daughter was over a year old after he left the military, and the young family moved to Columbus to be closer to Beightler's employment. Columbus was also a booming city with many opportunities.
Beightler would complete his engineering degree at OSU. He would also start a private civil engineering firm with Adolph Stellhorn. He went on to Command and General Staff School in Leavenworth, Kansas, to complete a course on National Guard Officers where he was first in his class. In 1930, he graduated from the Army War College's G-2 course.
Return to active duty.
In 1932, Beightler returned to active duty, serving with the Army General Staff in Washington D.C. This exposed him to the highest levels of the Army, something rarely afforded to National Guard officers. He would spend most of his time working on plans for the Interstate Highway System.
In 1936 he returned to Ohio, working as chief of staff for the 37th Infantry Division, and commander of the 74th Infantry Brigade. Having earned the opportunity, in 1939 his longtime friend John W. Bricker, who had become Governor of Ohio, appointed Beightler to Ohio State Highway Director. In 1940, Bricker would appoint Beightler commanding General of the 37th Infantry Division.
Training the 37th Infantry Division.
Beightler assumed his duties as commanding General of the division in 1940, and immediately began exhaustive training and preparation of the soldiers. His philosophy was simple, the better trained the soldiers are, the less casualties there would be. He also had moral reasoning, having been quoted after World War Two saying "... I have never been able to completely harden myself to the sacrifice of American lives. I have always felt a deep-seated responsibility to the families of these men, many of whom might be called my neighbors."
The 37th would participate in the Louisiana Maneuvers, in which future senior military leaders Dwight Eisenhower, George Patton, Omar Bradley, and Leslie McNair were present. McNair would say of Beightler that he was "one of the best" National Guard commanders. A few months later, America would be thrown into World War II following the Pearl Harbor attacks.
World War two.
Following the training of the 37th, Beightler would lead them into battle in the Pacific theater of the war. The "Buckeye Division," as the 37th was called, entered the theater in 1942. The 37th were victorious in numerous battles, including victories at New Georgia, Bougainville and at the Battle of Manila. They would go on to liberate 1300 internees at the Bilibid Prison in Muntinglupa.
The Buckeye Division produced 7 Medal of Honor recipients during this war. Beightler was the only National Guard commanding officer to have led his troops throughout the course of the entire war. They were demobilized in November 1945.
Japanese surrender.
On September 5, 1945, Beightler accepted the articles of surrender from Major General Iguchi, Commanding General, 80th Brigade, Imperial Japanese Army, in Luzon, Philippines.
Post-War.
At the end of the war, Beightler was the only World War II National Guard general to have commanded his division for the length of the war. In addition to being the army's longest serving division commander in 1945, Beightler was appointed to the regular army in 1946 as one of only two National Guard major generals to receive such an appointment at that time. Following the war, Beightler was assigned command of the 5th Service Command at Fort Hayes in Columbus. In 1947, he was appointed President of the Personnel Board of the Secretary of War, moving back to Washington. In 1949, he was assigned to the Far East, taking over the Marianas-Bonins Command on Guam.
Military Governor of Okinawa.
In 1950, he was appointed the Deputy Military Governor of Okinawa, as well as the Deputy Governor of the Ryukyus Islands Command. During this period he dedicated most of his time toward rebuilding the infrastructure of the Ryukyus Islands. Following a massive heart attack in 1952, one of nine Beightler would suffer throughout his life, he was flown to Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington D.C. Beightler retired from the military after 42 years of service, in 1953.
Politics.
Beightler had been involved in politics since his return from World War One. He was a lifelong critic of too much federal power, and constantly feuded with Washington in defending the National Guard. He was a staunch conservative in the classical liberal sense, believing in the freedom of the States and a skeptic of the federal government.
He was active in the Ohio Republican Party, having been a longtime friend of John W. Bricker, and close friends of Ohio Republican leader Ed Schorr and U.S. Senate Majority Leader and Presidential Son Robert A. Taft. He had extensive media contacts in Ohio, from Preston Wolfe at the Columbus Dispatch, David Baylor and Carl George of WGAR Cleveland, Gene DiMario of the Cincinnati Post, and Robert Harper of the Ohio State Journal that he would use to the 37th's advantage in a dispute with the War Department in Washington, as well as to keep up on the political environment personally. At one point he was the mayor of Marble Cliff, Ohio, a tony hamlet just outside downtown Columbus. He was an alternate delegate from the Ohio delegation to the 1940 Republican National Convention.
Gubernatorial and congressional consideration.
In the spring of 1945 the Ohio Republican Party attempted to draft Beightler to run for Governor against Frank Lausche in 1946. His candidacy was urged by Bricker, and Ohio Congressman Clarence J. Brown. This would have provided early key endorsements. Hundreds of insider Republicans wrote to Beightler stating he would have their support, would easily clinch the Republican nomination for Governor, and could defeat Lausche.
However, citing the lack of a completely unified party around his potential candidacy, he didn't want to cause a factional split in the party. He also cited the unlikelihood that he could beat Lausche because he was a great campaigner, as well as the fact that he agreed with him on almost every issue, in deciding that the attempt was not worthwhile. His decision was also influenced by the fact he was still engaged in battle in the Pacific theater.
He did write that ending his public career as governor of "the grand old state of Ohio" was an appealing prospect. Beightler miscalculated the political atmosphere, as Lausche would lose by 40,000 votes the following year in a banner year for Republicans.
In 1946, talks circulated again of Beightler running for political office, this time for Congress. However, he said was not interested in a legislative position and called it "a nobody's job."
Opposition to Eisenhower candidacy.
On November 9, 1950, he sent a letter to Robert A. Taft congratulating him on his Senate re-election victory while stationed in the Pacific. The letter offered a little insight into Beightler's political world, in which he expressed doubt in Dwight Eisenhower being President of the United States, if elected in 1952. The letter discussed a personal meeting with Gen. Douglas MacArthur on the subject, in which Beightler had encouraged MacArthur to run in '52, but MacArthur showed no interest. MacArthur shared the same views as Beightler on Eisenhower, and both would go on to endorse Taft in 1952. In Taft's reply on November 24, 1950, he implies to Beightler that Eisenhower is incompetent and likely to be influenced by money and political endorsements.
Ohio Turnpike Commission.
After leaving the military in 1953, Beightler would head the Ohio Turnpike Commission, being appointed executive director. Beightler oversaw the construction and completion of the Ohio Turnpike. He resigned as executive director to become a member of the commission, before he retired altogether in 1962.
Retirement and family.
Beightler retired officially in 1962 to Worthington, Ohio. Over the years he had been a good investor, and had a large retirement savings. He enjoyed gardening and fishing, and spent his winters in Florida. He followed national and international affairs closely, as well as Wall Street out of interest of his own financial holdings. He was also active in veterans and civic groups.
Beightler had two children with Anne, Robert Jr., who would go onto attend the United States Military Academy at West Point, and Marjorie. Robert Jr. served in the Philippines during World War II as a platoon leader in the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment (United States) of the 11th Airborne Division. Despite both father and son fighting in their respective divisions in the Battle of Manila, neither would meet in combat until April in northern Luzon.
Beightler died on February 12, 1978. He is buried at Oakdale Cemetery in Marysville.
Beightler had said of his hometown “With you, I lived many of my greatest moments, from which I have many of my fondest memories. Memories of Marysville during my 28 years here are among my warmest thoughts.”
Honors.
Robert Beightler was the recipient of numerous honors, including the Distinguished Service Cross for his leadership in the Philippines campaign, the Silver Star Medal, the Purple Heart, the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Distinguished Service Medal for the New Georgia campaign, with an Oak Leaf cluster for his service in Bougainville and Luzon, and the Legion of Merit with an Oak Leaf cluster.
On September 25, 1945, Beightler received his 33d degree from the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. He was awarded the Legion of Honor from the Philippine government. In June 1952, Beightler was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of the Ryukyus for his work in rebuilding the infrastructure. The National Guard armory in Columbus is named in his honor. It is the headquarters of the Ohio National Guard.
In 1969, the city of Marysville, Ohio dedicated 5th Street in honor of Beightler, naming it Major General Robert S. Beightler Way.
In 1993, the Ohio Department of Veterans Affairs inducted him into the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame. In 2007, the Union County, Ohio Chamber of Commerce declared September 28 to be Major General Robert S. Beightler Day.
In 2007, the Ohio Historical Society dedicated an historical marker on 5th Street in Uptown Marysville in honor of Beightler. Hundreds of citizens attended the ceremony, with officials present from the office of Gov. Ted Strickland, U.S. Senator George Voinovich, and the Ohio National Guard. In 2007, the Ohio Department of Transportation funded his memorial marker at the Veterans Memorial in Marysville, Ohio.

Buried in Time (Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys)

Buried in Time is a Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys Supermystery novel.
George Fayne and Nancy Drew go to Oklahoma, where a Jim Haber introduces them to Carson Drew's old friend who was in crisis, Dr. Langford. Langford heads an archaeological dig but strange things are happening at the site. There are cave-ins and thefts in the vaults of the Red Clay artifacts. There, Nancy spots Frank and Joe Hardy, and after lunching together, Nancy finds out that they are there on the case of missing truck shipments that contained uranium and heavy water- materials used to make an atom bomb. 
The next morning, a cave-in has supposedly killed Dr. Langford in a vault. As the interrogations go on, a Comanche woman named Red Sky Winsea and he grandfather John Whiteshirt talk about warning Langfrod that the "spirits" at the Red Clay gravesites were out to avenge their disturbances. The two become prime suspects in the murder after George finds a note with the same warning on it in Langfrod's office. With Langford now gone, Dr. Ottman heads the dig. Nancy and George discover that right before this major site was found by Ottman, he came down with food poisoning and all the credit for the discovery was given to Langford. Some diggers hint that Ottman was probably mad at Langfor for stealing his thunder.
Meanwhile, Frank and Joe Hardy get barked at by Captain Van Allen Lorimor at the Jackson Air Force Base when they reveal that they are the "Network fellas" and gives them the records of the missing shipments, which was really no help. Back at the site, Nancy and George have to tell Lieutenant Deerhunter that they were on a stakeout the night before to see if they could catch the vault thief red-handed. The police are all buddy-buddy with Nancy now, but both cases seem to be gong nowhere, until their dying mysteries got a jumpstart where they realize that both cases may be intertwined after all.

Maxims (Old English poems)

The titles Maxims I (A, B and C) and Maxims II refer to pieces of Old English gnomic poetry. The poem "Maxims I" can be found in the Exeter Book and "Maxims II" is located in a lesser known manuscript, London, British Library, Cotton Tiberius B i. "Maxims I" and "Maxims II" are classified as wisdom poetry, being both influenced by wisdom literature, such as the Psalms and Proverbs of the Old Testament scriptures. Although they are separate poems of diverse contents, they have been given a shared name because the themes throughout each poem are similar.
"Maxims I".
"Maxims I" can be found in the second section of the Exeter Book. The author(s) of this poem is unknown. Although dating can be tricky, scholars generally think that this poem was copied down in the latter half of the tenth century. The maxims in "Maxims I" discuss topics ranging from the afterlife, nature, and the social standing of women. "In the man, martial warlike arts must burgeon; and the woman must excel as one cherished among her people, and be buoyant of mood, keep confidences, be open-heartedly generous with horses and with treasures..." 
These maxims are also called gnomes. The idea of gnomic literature dates back to Aristotle, who defined a gnome as "A statement not relating to particulars, as e.g. the character of Iphicrates, but to universals; yet not to all universals indiscriminately, as e.g. that straight is the opposite of crooked, but to all such as are the objects of (human) action and are to be chosen or avoided in our doings". Since the material in "Maxims I" is sententious in its character, it is regarded as gnomic poetry as opposed to a collection of proverbs or merely wise sayings.
"Maxims I" is divided into three sections. The opening section begins with a dialogue in which the writer espouses a wisdom contest found in other Old English texts. The middle section discusses natural phenomena such as frost and the seasons, as well as containing a passage about a man's wife welcoming him home from a long journey. The final section contains a comparison of Woden, the creator of idols, to the god of Christianity, who formed the earth and everything in it. "Woden fashioned idols, the Ruler of all fashioned heaven and the spacious skies". This section also consists of reflections of those who have been exiled, the comfort of song, and the need for courage in daily life.
"Maxims II".
Stanley Greenfield and Richard Evert, in their article ""Maxims II": Gnome and Poem" characterize the poem "Maxims II" as possessing “a rambling style which covers a great deal of ground, yet never reaches any particular goal”. Some view "Maxims II" as being similar to how a compilation of poetry is written and edited. For example, Henk Aertsen and Rolf Bremmer, in their "Companion to Old English Poetry", state, "lack of unity characterizes these lines". Still other critics disagree. A.P.M. Orchard in "Medieval England: an Encyclopedia" comments, "It can be argued that each maxim is implicitly linked to its neighbor and that, far from being a haphazard list of commonplaces, "Maxims II" (like "Maxims I") has a coherent organic structure”. 
It is widely believed that "Maxims II" was influenced by the monks who copied it, since it contains gnomes of a religious nature. "Maxims II" states, "The shape of the future is obscure and unknowable; the Lord alone knows it, the Redeeming Father". Compared with the Old Testament proverb, "Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring forth" (Proverbs 27:1, Old Testament, NIV), one can readily see the influence of Christianity on the poem. When reading "Maxims II", the organisation and themes of the poem are not readily visible. For example, Paul Cavill writes that the argument of the apparent disjointedness of the poem is important because the poet pits Christ and Fate against each other, thus illustrating the traditional nature and remains of pagan belief in the poetry. Cavill cites the gnomes in "Maxims II", "... the powers of Christ are great, fate is strongest". However, most experts believe that the pagan material in the poems has been thoroughly worked over by their Christian redactors.
Similarities between "Maxims I" and "Maxims II".
In "Maxims I", the Old English verbs "biþ" (implying an actual and ongoing state of being) and "sceal" (stating what ought to be the case) are used repeatedly throughout the first and second sections. Byþ and sceal are an important aspect of the Maxims II. Many people who study these poems and the themes that exist between both the Maxims I and the Maxims II poems discuss this topic. These words are translated for byþ as “be” and for sceal as “shall”. This, however, causes an issue because these translations are not always helpful in context. Marie Nelson suggests that the verb sceal can also be translated to “shall be”, which then raises the “question of whether futurity or necessity is implied.” Nelson sees that the problem may cause an issue in the meaning of the translation and may confuse the reader. As it remains, the two words are most clearly understood as “what is” and “what should be.” (M. Nelson, ' "Is" and "Ought" in the Exeter Book Maxims', Southern Folklore Quarterly 45 (1981), 109-21) The poem combines observations about the world with small stories and moral statements. "Maxims II" does much the same. These poems are part of the genre known as wisdom literature, found in many different cultures, and can also be compared to the method used by Christ by using everyday situations to explain deeper truths. The influence of the Christian monks who copied it upon the traditional material in the poems may thus be seen.
In addition to providing moral guidance and precepts for everyday life, both "Maxims" poems "organize things and people into categories, catalogue trade rules, and list things as diverse as skills, fates, and rune names". As mentioned previously, the references to common occurrences in nature and society made the poems of general interest, though both poems also describe proper behaviour for the aristocracy of the day as well. The reference in "Maxims I" of "A king has to procure a queen with payment, with goblets and with rings". and in "Maxims II" the gnome "The king belongs in his hall, sharing out rings". are evidence of this.
In addition, both poems contain themes that coincide with the most famous Old English poem "Beowulf". "Maxims I" refers to Cain just as "Beowulf" does and contains maxims for the wife of a hero returning home from his exploits which is similar to Beowulf returning home from his adventures. Like "Beowulf", "Maxims II" refers to a dragon. "The dragon belongs in its barrow, canny and jealous of its jewels". The dragon was not considered a fictional animal in this period, but a real part of the natural world - like other animals that Anglo-Saxons had heard of but not seen because they lived in other parts of the world.

Volčji Potok

Volčji Potok (; ) is a village on a terrace on the left bank of the Kamnik Bistrica River in the Municipality of Kamnik in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia.
History.
A cell of the first Communist Party in the Kamnik area was established at the Cerar Inn in 1939. During the Second World War, the Partisans broke into the manor in the village on 14 January 1943 and stole a large quantity of food. After the war, much working-class housing was built in Volčji Potok. A catchment basin for local water supply was built below the village in 1967.
Castle and manor.
The overgrown foundations of Volčji Potok Castle () stand east of the village on Wolf Hill (). The castle was first mentioned in written sources in 1220, but was already in ruins by the 17th century. Construction of Volčji Potok Manor ()), which stood below the hill, was begun by the Bonhomo family in the 17th century. The manor was purchased in 1882 by Ferdinand Souvan (1840–1915), who remodeled it and planted the meadow in front of it with trees. This park was expanded to 12 hectares by his son Leon Souvan (1877–1949), who planted it with domestic and exotic trees and surrounded it with a hornbeam hedge. The manor was burned by the Partisans on 13 April 1944. After the war, the ruins of the manor were razed and the manor chapel was converted into a restaurant.
Arboretum.
Today, Volčji Potok is best known for its arboretum, the largest and most popular botanical garden in Slovenia. The Volčji Potok Arboretum is open from the beginning of March until the end of November. It was established in 1952 by the University of Ljubljana on what was already a well-established estate with extensive parks around a Baroque mansion that was destroyed in the Second World War.
Church.
The local church is dedicated to Saint Oswald. It features several paintings from Leopold Layer's school. The church was first mentioned in written sources in 1526 and was reworked in the 18th century.

K-250 Submarine

The K-250 submarine is usually configured to be a one person personal submarine that is rated to go down to 250 fsw. The sub was designed by retired US Navy WWII submarine captain George Kittredge. It's a basic solid submarine that is usually privately owned.
Kittredge used to build these subs during the 70's and 80's, and there are still a number of them still in use today. They generally weigh 2200 pounds when fully outfitted. Their hull is a quarter of an inch thick, and usually made out of A-36 mild steel, or ASME-516 Grade 70 high carbon steel. They have twin keels, that also act as skids so the sub doesn't need to be placed in a cradle. The K-250 has a 150 pound drop weight, that can be released to make the sub float to the surface if all the other systems have failed. The drop weight is made up of a metal tray and a number of lead bricks. If released, having the lead broken up into smaller bricks makes them easier to recover by a SCUBA diver if they are not too deep.
The plans call for the sub to have three 12 volt car batteries, and two SCUBA tanks, used primarily to blow the water out of the front and rear soft ballast tanks. These external soft ballast tanks are usually made out of a fiberglass composite or steel. Some K-250's have a single action grabber arm in the front.

My Husband Has Gone

"My Husband Has Gone" ("Ibanyi Agyenzire" in Runyankole-Rukiga) is a poem by Ugandan writer Mukotani Rugyendo, composed originally in Runyankole-Rukiga in 1969 and translated into English for an anthology shortly thereafter. It is a popular feature of East African secondary school examinations and has also featured in Oxford's English collection from the region.
History.
Rugyendo originally penned the poem in his Senior Six at Ntare School in Mbarara. Some time later Richard Ntiru, editor of the poetry collection "Tensions", and an old schoolmate, wrote to him from Uganda Publishing House in Kampala, where he was doing vacation work, to let him know that the house was looking to collect poems originally composed in mother tongues and translated by their authors into English. Rugyendo complied, submitting two pieces in both forms. One was "My Husband Has Gone".
When he went to Dar es Salaam for his university studies in 1970, Rugyendo almost completely forgot about the poems. In January 1971, Idi Amin came to power, and he observed the disorienting effect on the lives of his peers, not least of all the high-ranking managers at Uganda Publishing House: "that," he wrote some 35 years later, "seems to have been the end of the project." The poem remained unpublished.
The next time Rugyendo, still in Dar es Salaam, encountered it was when the Oxford University Press contacted hhim from Nairobi, seeking the right to publish the English version in a collection of verse from East Africa. He saw no reason to refuse and promptly jumped at the chance, omitting in the process to ask where the publishers had found the poem and what had become of its mother-tongue version.

Post-transfusion purpura

Post-transfusion purpura (PTP) is an adverse reaction to a blood transfusion or platelet transfusion that occurs when the body produces alloantibodies to the introduced platelets' antigens. These alloantibodies destroy the patient's platelets leading to thrombocytopenia, a rapid decline in platelet count. PTP usually presents 5–12 days after transfusion, and is a potentially fatal condition.
Mechanism and treatment.
PTP is rare, but usually occurs in women who have had multiple pregnancies or in men who have undergone previous transfusions. The precise mechanism leading to PTP is unknown, but it most commonly occurs in individuals whose platelets lack the HPA-1a antigen (old name: PLA1). The patient develops antibodies to the HPA-1a antigen leading to platelet destruction. It is unclear why alloantibodies attack the patient's own, as well as the introduced platelets. It is usually self-limiting, but IV IgG therapy is the primary treatment. Plasmapheresis is also an option for treatment.

<doc id="20592256" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20592256" title="The Best Loved Game">
The Best Loved Game

The Best Loved Game is a book written by Geoffrey Moorhouse. It was written during the summer of 1978 (and it was first published the following year). This book describes the English cricket season of that year. It is worth mentioning that 1978 was an extraordinary time for the cricket world. The arrival of Kerry Packer about a year ago had threatened to change the whole nature of the game. Lured by the money and the media-coverage guaranteed by the media-mogul, some of the top players of world cricket had signed contracts with Packer, thus making themselves unavailable from official international cricket. With the problems being unprecedented, the cricketing world was completely unprepared for this. There were all kinds of confusions and even the high court got involved in the dispute. For a brief period, the future of the royal game looked very uncertain. At that time, Moorhouse, a very distinguished writer, who loved the game immensely, decided to chronicle the cricketing events of the summer. He, like many others at the time, thought that the game would soon change forever. "It seemed important to record an English season while the matter was still in balance, lest the shape and nature of our cricket should presently be spoiled.” 
Theme.
The book contains description of 14 fixtures of various kinds. Obviously, the writer starts the book at Lord's, the Mecca of cricket, with the traditional three-day fixture between the MCC and the County champions of previous season (in this case, Middlesex). He visits the Mecca three more times, during the course of the season, (in June for the test match against Pakistan, in July, for the Oldest Fixture, between Eton and Harrow School, and finally in early September for the Gillette Cup final). But he does not confine himself to big grounds and big matches only. He goes to Oxfordshire to cover a village championship game, he goes to Lichfield for a minor county game. In short, he wants to cover cricket, as a part of English summer, and in this, he succeeds greatly.
Style.
For more than half a century Sir Neville Cardus was the undisputed king of cricket writing. His style influenced more than one generation of cricket writers. Moorhouse was no exception. Of course, he had a few things in common with the great Cardus: they both came from North-West England, Cardus from Manchester, Moorhouse from Bolton, both spent a considerable amount of their professional career at Manchester Guardian, and most importantly, both greatly loved the game of cricket. The greatest thing about this book is that Moorhouse covers the matches as a cricket writer, not as a cricket reporter, and the difference can be enormous. Following the style of the great man, Moorhouse cares less about the statistics (although the scorecards are provided in details at the end of every match report). Instead, in the spirit of Cardus, he gives characters to the players, describes the scenario, talks about the past heroes of Cricket, and even talks about his own emotions. He starts “The Roses Match” recollecting his family connection with the Red Roses. Wherever he goes, he tries to fathom the sprit of the particular match. Thus, this book describes the sprit of the game more than anything else.
An important point to make here is that while the Packer affair had a lot to do with the writing of the book, the writer isn’t interested about the merits or demerits of Packer’s intentions. While he starts the introduction of the book with “This book owes something to Mr. Kerry Packer, without whom it might not have been written”, he also mentions in the same page “I do not wish to argue here the rights and wrongs of the Packer affair, much less to recount its already wearisome history.”.
So, while the name Packer appears many times in the book, the only serious comment that the writer makes about the whole affair (and he is right in his comment) is ”In one respect, and in only one I think, he (Packer) has done a service to the game by forcing us all to face the fact cricketers have been abysmally ill-paid.”. So, as a whole “The Best Loved Game” is not about any controversial issue, it is simply about cricket being part of the English summer.
Interestingly, all the buzz about the Packer affair, which looked such a menace in 78, died down within a year or so, as the richest man in Australia and ICC managed to reach an agreement. Yet, the changes introduced by Packer have not only lasted for a considerable time, in fact, these have continued to produce more changes to the game. Cricket is now fully internationalized, and at the same time fully commercialized. International stars are now richly paid (and so are the commentators), thanks mainly to the backings and blessings of satellite TV channels. In a sense, Packer was a bit too ahead of his time.
The 'Love’ affair.
In 1977, test cricket celebrated its 100th anniversary. While test cricket still remains the most prestigious cricketing event, the general public nowadays are more interested in the shorter versions of the game, One Day Internationals and (in more recent times), the 20-20s. Instead of white shirts, the cricketers now wear multicolored dresses. Day night cricket, introduced by Packer in Australia, is now common everywhere. Yet despite all these changes, there is no doubt that the great game of cricket has its origin in the villages of England. For all the new introductions to the game (like 3rd umpire, TV replay, powerplay etc.) cricket still remains a very simple game. There are many who love the game simply because of its simplicity. For such people, ‘The Best Loved Game” can be a wonderful reading.

Bayerwald-Ticket

The Bayerwald-Ticket (lit: Bavarian Forest ticket) is a special, low-cost, local railway ticket introduced in 1999 for the counties ("Landkreise") of Regen and Freyung-Grafenau in the Bavarian Forest in southeast Germany. Until 2003 it was only valid between May and October; from 2004 it has been valid all-year round.
History.
The Bayerwald-Ticket emerged as a common fare for various German public transport networks ("ÖPNV") that were aimed at tourists.
As a result, in 1995 a dense network of daily bus line routes, using the so-called "Igel" buses (hedgehog buses), was established for hikers during the summer season from May to October by the Bavarian Forest National Park and the towns of Spiegelau, Grafenau, Neuschönau and Mauth.
In 1997 the Regentalbahn took over traffic operations on the Plattling-Zwiesel-Bayerisch Eisenstein, as well as its two branches to Bodenmais and Grafenau. Finally the line was refurbished, new vehicles were bought and regular services were gradually introduced on all three lines.
In the area of Zwiesel a similar bus service concept to that in the southern part of the Bavarian Forest was adopted on two of the routes using the Falkenstein buses.
In order to enable the use of these three transport systems to be simpler and more comfortable, the counties introduced a standard day ticket for buses and trains. In additional to this fare they published a common timetable booklet. At first this offer was only available during the summer season. After ski buses were laid on in winter by both the Igel and Falkenstein buses, from 2004 the ticket was made available all-year round and the timetable produced in summer and winter editions.

The ticket currently costs €7 per day (as at 2013) and covers the railway and bus lines within the aforementioned counties as well as the Regentalbahn railway between Bad Kötzting and Lam in Landkreis Cham. The supplementary fare "Bayerwald-Ticket-plus", at €14, is also valid on the line between Gotteszell and Plattling in the Landkreis Deggendorf. A family ticket was also offered for a while, but later withdrawn.
Since the Regentalbahn has extended its operations via Bayerisch Eisenstein station on several of its services to the Czech town of Špičák and the Regionalbus Ostbayern (RBO) introduced an express bus from Železná Ruda to Passau, the ticket has been extended to cover these routes in the Czech Republic as well.

Plenmeller

 
Plenmeller is a village in Northumberland, England about a mile (1½ km) southeast of Haltwhistle.
Governance.
Plenmeller is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham. The parish council is Plenmeller with Whitfield.
Economy.
Coal mining dominated the history of the area in recent times. Employment at Plenmeller colliery reached its peak in the early 1920s. When the colliery closed in 1932 it caused widespread hardship in the area. More recently coal has been extracted by open cast methods on Plenmeller Common and land then returned to a more natural landscape.
RPC Containers Ltd., maunfacturers of blow-moulded plastic containers, now operate from the site of the old colliery.
Landmarks.
Unthank Hall is a Grade II listed mansion house, now serving as commercial offices, situated on the southern bank of the River South Tyne. The house, which was built in the 16th century, incorporating an ancient Pele tower, was substantially remodelled and extended in 1815. The Hall was later rebuilt between 1862 and 1865. Much of the 1865 house has since between demolished and only the central gables and entrance porch survive.
Transport.
The old Penmeller Halt on the Haltwhistle to Alston line was opened in 1919 to serve the colliery. The halt closed in the 1960s and has been demolished. The village is now served by Haltwhistle railway station on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, also known as the Tyne Valley Line. The line was opened in 1838, and links the city of Newcastle upon Tyne in Tyne and Wear with Carlisle in Cumbria. The line follows the course of the River Tyne through Northumberland.
Passenger services on the Tyne Valley Line are operated by Northern Rail and First ScotRail. The line is also heavily used for freight.
The village lies just to the south of the A69 road as it bypasses Haltwhistle. The road is a major road running east-west across the Pennines, linking Newcastle upon Tyne with Carlisle in Cumbria.

Club career.
Early career.
Sakai was born in New York City to a Japanese father and a German mother. The family moved to Japan when he was two years old. He grew up in Sanjō, Niigata prefecture. Sakai started playing football at Sanjō junior soccer club, together with his brother Noriyoshi. At age 15, he joined Albirex Niigata youth academy and entered Kaishi Gakuen High School. His team played at the Prince Takamado Cup, All Japan Club Youth Soccer tournament and J. League Youth tournament.
Years later in his final year at school, he was chosen as one of the designated players for development by J. League Division 1 and JFA. With this status, he was able to register as a J. League club player while he was still eligible to play for his school. He made his Albirex first-team debut, at the age of 17, on 15 November 2008 in the Emperor's Cup match against FC Tokyo. He officially signed with Albirex Niigata in the following season. After becoming professional, he was assigned the number 24 shirt. He made his professional football debut in the opening J1 League match of the 2009 season also against FC Tokyo.
VfB Stuttgart.
On 1 January 2012, Gōtoku Sakai was loaned out to VfB Stuttgart until June 2013. VfB Stuttgart secured the contract option to sign Sakai permanently.
On 11 February 2012, Sakai made his Bundesliga debut for VfB Stuttgart in a 5–0 home victory against Hertha BSC. He made 14 starts and recorded five assists in his first Bundesliga season. Sakai scored his first goal for Stuttgart on 22 November 2012 in a 5–1 away victory against FC Steaua București in the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League group stage.
On 10 January 2013, Sakai signed a contract with Stuttgart until June 2016 and moved permanently to VfB.

<doc id="20592350" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20592350" title="Missile Approach Warning">
Missile Approach Warning

A Missile Approach Warning system is part of the avionics package on some military aircraft. A sensor detects attacking missiles. Its automatic warning cues the pilot to make a defensive maneuver and deploy the available countermeasures to disrupt missile tracking.
Guided Surface to Air Missile (SAM) systems were developed during World War II but only really started to make their presence felt in the 1950s. In response, electronic countermeasures (ECM) and flying tactics were developed to overcome them. They proved to be quite successful provided that reliable and timely threat warning was given.
The infra red heat seeking missile threat.
Analysis of aircraft losses due to enemy action since the 1960s shows that at least 70% of all losses were attributed to passive heat seeking i.e. Infra Red (IR) guided missiles. This might appear surprising considering that radar guided SAM systems have longer engagement ranges, are faster, have higher maneuvering potential, carries larger warheads and are equipped with proximity fuzes.
The main reason why IR guided missiles were so effective was that it took much longer to develop effective warning systems against them. Most aircraft that were shot down never knew that the missile(s) were coming. Radar warning receivers on the other hand already proved their effectiveness by the early 1970s which considerably improved the survival rate of aircraft against radar threats.
The first air to air IR missiles appeared in the 1950s. The technology allowed more compact missile designs and made it possible to develop IR Man Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) i.e. shoulder launched missiles, which became operational by the 1960s.
IR MANPADS are relatively cheap, quite robust, easy to operate and difficult to detect. They also do not require the infrastructure often associated with radar guided SAM deployments which often reveals their presence.
Vast quantities of MANPADS have been manufactured (more than 700,000 produced since 1970 according to CSIS "Transnational Threats Update" Volume 1. No 10. 2003). Large numbers proliferated during the Cold War and immediate post Cold War era. Substantial quantities are available and affordable on the black market and have found their way into the hands of "non state" organizations or the so-called "asymmetric" threat. (An estimate by Jane's Intelligence Review of Feb 2003 puts this number as high as 150 000). An article "Proliferation of MANPADS and the Threat to Civil Aviation" of August 13, 2003 by Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre estimates that the black market price of MANPADS like the SA-7 could be as low as $5,000.
Intelligence regarding the whereabouts of MANPADS, especially in the hands of "non state" organizations, is usually vague and unreliable. This, in turn, makes it difficult to anticipate where and when to expect MANPADS attacks.
The 2nd and 3rd generation MANPADS appeared by the 1980s and further increased the performance and effectiveness of MANPADS due to advanced new seeker head technology, improved rocket motors and aerodynamic refinements. Their performance improved in terms of lethal range, minimum launch angle, maneuvering potential and all aspect engagement angles (1st generation MANPADS were restricted to only rear sector attacks). They also became more ECM resistant.
MANPADS therefore became even more lethal specifically against more vulnerable platforms such as helicopters, light aircraft, and commercial and military transport aircraft (during approaches and departures). The slower speed of these platforms forces them to spend more time within the kill zones of MANPADS compared to high performance fighter and strike aircraft.
At least 35 MANPADS attacks on civilian aircraft are on record. Twenty four were shot down killing about 500 people in the process.
Missile Approach Warning (MAW) system requirements.
Protecting aircraft against IR guided missiles depends in most cases firstly on reliable detection and warning of missiles and secondly on applying effective ECM. 
An exception to this are Omni Directional IR jammers which do not make use of missile warning at all as they simply radiate modulated IR energy for as long as they are switched on. These jammers have been around since the 1970s and when the correct jamming modulation techniques were applied, were reasonably effective against 1st generation amplitude modulated MANPADS which operated in the near-IR band (1 to 2 micrometres (µm)). The arrival of 2nd and 3rd generation MANPADS however changed that. They operate in the mid-IR band (3 to 5 µm) and make use of more advanced modulation techniques (for example frequency modulation). Therefore instead of jamming these missiles, the Omni Directional IR jammer now actually became a source for the missiles to home in.
Functional requirements.
Providing timely warning against IR MANPADS is a challenge. They give no warning of their presence prior to launch, they do not rely on active IR, radar guidance or a laser designator which would possibly emit a detectable Radiation. They are typically fire and forget and can lock on and engage a target, speed to the target and destroy it in seconds . They do however have a small but visible radar signature and also a propellant which burns - depending on the platform, typically for a very short duration.
MANPADS are relatively short range weapons, typically up to about five kilometers with the heart of the kill envelope one to three kilometers. They therefore allow very little margin for error to effectively counter them as the time to impact (TTI) on a target at one kilometer, is only about three seconds. The TTI for targets at three and five kilometers is also relatively short – only seven to a little over eleven seconds respectively.
The MAW must therefore provide reliable and timely warning to allow appropriate counter measure responses. Near 100% probability of warning (POW) and very fast reaction times to counter nearby missile launches (in the order of one second) are therefore essential.
Air crew will only rely on the system if they have high confidence in it. The MAW must therefore also have sufficiently low false alarm rates (FAR), even when illuminated by multiple sources (which may include threats) from different directions.
Quick response times and low FAR are however inherently conflicting requirements. An acceptable solution therefore requires a balanced approach to provide the most successful end result without compromising the POW. Since a longer time-to-impact (TTI) warning is almost invariably desirable, this leads to the conclusion that there is something like a too-low FAR: all warning systems gather data, and then make decisions when some confidence level is reached. False alarms represent decision errors, which (assuming optimal processing) can only be reduced by gathering more information, which means taking more time, inevitably resulting in a reduced time-to-impact. Most users would tolerate an increased FAR (up to some point where it starts limiting operations) instead of a reduced TTI, because their probability of survival depends fairly directly on the TTI, which represents the time in which countermeasures can be deployed.
Accurate azimuth and elevation angle of attack (AOA) information can be another very important requirement. Directional IR Counter Measures (DIRCM) systems depend on MAW systems for accurate enough initial pointing (about two degrees) to ensure that the DIRCM acquires and engages incoming missiles timely and successfully.
Accurate AOA is also important in deciding the dispensing direction of the counter measure decoys (flares). It is vital to avoid the situation where the platform and the dispensed decoys both remain within the instantaneous field of view (IFoV) of incoming missiles. In situations like that missiles could very well, once they pass the decoys, still hit the platform. This is of particular importance where separation between the decoys and the platform takes too long as is the case with slow flying aircraft.
Accurate AOA is further important where the platform should preferably maneuver when dispensing decoys to increase the miss distance. This is however more applicable to fast jets where their high speed tends to negate the separation caused by the decoy's ejection velocity. A turn towards approaching missiles to establish/increase the angle between the decoy and the platform is especially important in cases where a missile approaches from the rear between the five or seven 'o clock sectors. If the AOA is not accurate enough, the pilot could very well turn in the wrong direction and set himself up for the situation as described above.
The system must also be fully automated as the human reaction time in relevant cases (short range launches) is too long.
Physical requirements.
Light aircraft, helicopters and fighters usually have limited space and mass capacity for additional equipment. The system should also not cause adverse aerodynamic drag which demands minimal physical size and number of boxes. The power consumption must further be kept within the capacity of the platform's electrical system.
To reduce the installation and integration costs, the necessary interfaces have to be provided to ensure communication and co-existence with other on-board avionics.
Human Machine Interface (HMI) requirements.
Integrated display and control functions are desirable to avoid duplication on instrument panels where space is limited. If a platform is equipped with both radar and missile warning systems, the HMI should display both threats clearly and unambiguously.
The integrated HMI must also indicate the system’s operating status, serviceability status, mode of operation, remaining decoy quantities etc. Separate control panels are only justified for safety of flight purposes such as ECM on/off and decoy jettison functions.
Cost considerations.
Procuring EW self-protection systems has direct and indirect cost implications.
Direct costs involve the initial price of the system, spare parts as well as test equipment to ensure that the performance and availability of the systems is maintained throughout their entire life cycle.
Installing and integrating EW systems on aircraft is another direct cost
Indirect cost on the other hand involves degradation of the aircraft’s performance as a result of having the system on-board which in turn impacts negatively on the operating cost of the aircraft.
The lowest initial price of a system does therefore not necessary offer the best solution as all the factors needs to be considered. The overall cost effectiveness of systems i.e. price versus performance is more important in deciding which system to select.
Types of Missile Approach Warning (MAW) systems.
Three different technologies have been used for MAW systems i.e.
based systems. Each technology has their advantages and shortcomings which can be summarized as follows:
MAW systems.
Current available MAW systems as well as those under development, represent all three types of technologies. Each technology has strong and weak points and none provide a perfect solution.

Doug Yeabsley

Douglas (Doug) Ian Yeabsley (born 3 January 1942) in Exeter, Devon, is a former minor counties cricketer who represented the Minor Counties and, particularly Devon County Cricket Club from 1959 to 1990, 31 years.
Career.
A left-arm medium pace bowler and a left-handed tail end batsman, Yeabsley made his debut for Devon "in 1959, aged 17, while still at Exeter School, and continued for 31 seasons, a tribute to his durability and skill".
Yeabsley made four appearances in first-class cricket and 41 in List A matches. His first-class appearances were all made for the Minor Counties representative team against touring international opposition. His best bowling return was achieved against the 1974 Pakistan touring team, taking 3–45 including the wickets of Mushtaq Mohammad, Wasim Bari and Wasim Raja—all Test players.
Yeabsley's last List A appearance, was versus Worcestershire in the 1987 NatWest Trophy, when he was 45. Ian Botham and Graeme Hick both made hundreds. Worcestershire scored their 404 runs at a rate of nearly seven runs per over. Yeabsley's 12 overs cost just 50 runs; the other four bowlers conceded 79–97 runs off the same number of overs.
Yeabsley has been described as "undoubtedly England's best amateur bowler of the Seventies, at left-arm fast-medium".
Family and teaching career.
Yeabsley's two sons, Michael and Richard both played first-class cricket, the latter in particular with some success. Both were educated at Haberdashers' Aske's Boys School, where Doug taught chemistry from 1964 and coached the school first XI and rugby first XV.

Rafflesia lobata

Rafflesia lobata is a parasitic plant species of the genus "Rafflesia". It is endemic to the Philippine island of Panay, particularly the mountains of Antique and Iloilo provinces. This is the second species recorded from the island of Panay. One of the most distinctive features of Rafflesia lobata is that some populations have flowers with a lobed diaphragm that opens outward. Nearly all other Rafflesia (and Sapria) species have diaphragms that curve inward. That said, it is interesting to note that this feature is polymorphic in R. lobata (at least as the species is currently defined). As shown in the photos below, in some populations the diaphragm curves inward and may be 3- or 6-lobed. Note the 6-lobed flower also has 6 perigone lobes. It remains to be seen whether flower merousity has phylogenetic significance that should be taxonomically recognized. It should also be noted that some populations of R. manillana, such as one at Bolos Point, Cagayan Valley, Luzon, also have flowers with lobed, outwardly curving diaphragms. 
The name of the species was derived from its distinctive lobed diaphragm.
The first population of "R. lobata" was discovered by the local conservation group studying Philippine Spotted Deer ("Cervus alfredi").

Trevalga

Trevalga () is a coastal civil parish and village in north Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The parish is bounded on the north by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south-east by Forrabury and Minster parish and on the west by Tintagel parish.
The village of Trevalga lies 500 metres from the coast on the seaward side of the road from Boscastle to Tintagel. Unusually, the village is part of an estate owned by Marlborough College, a public school in Wiltshire. The estate has been held by the college in trust since 1961 under a bequest of the last Lord of Trevalga Manor, Gerald Curgenven (died 1959). This was to ensure its preservation from development and allow local families to remain there. However, in 2010, the college was told that it was breaking charity law by owning a hamlet, and thereafter placed the entire estate on the market (the legality of this is being disputed by the Trustees and Tenants of the estate and the sale has been suspended until this is resolved). This situation has caused understandable concern amongst the tenants, and other inhabitants, about the future of the village. Thereafter, protests and petitions were set up, using the social networking website Facebook in an attempt to save the hamlet. There was formerly a slate quarry and a silver lead mine in the parish.
Trevalga is mentioned in the song "Black and Gold" along with other places nearby.
Trevalga lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation, with the same status and protection as a National Park.
Notable buildings.
The village church is also the parish church and is dedicated to St Petroc. Also in the parish is Trehane Barton (in its present form a farmhouse dating from 1743). The church was built in the 12th and 13th centuries (the tower being later than the nave and chancel). After restoration work the church was reopened in 1875. For many years it has been a member of the Boscastle Group of Anglican parishes.

Saskatchewan Silver Sox

The Saskatchewan Silver Sox are an independent professional baseball team based in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. They play in the developmental Arizona Winter League, a short-season instructional winter league affiliated with the North American League and compete in the International Division, as well as the Calexico Outlaws, San Diego Surf Dawgs, San Luis Atleticos and Team Canada. They began playing their home games in 2009 at Desert Sun Stadium in Yuma. (The Blythe Heat, El Centro Imperials and San Luis Atleticos played home games on their own fields until 2011.) They are owned by Diamond Sports & Entertainment.
Team name.
The Silver Sox brand belonged to the since-defunct Golden Baseball League Reno franchise and Reno's minor league team before them. The franchise began in the GBL as the Mesa Miners in 2005 and played one season at HoHoKam Park before relocating to Reno and becoming the new Silver Sox one year later. They played their home games at William Peccole Park at the University of Nevada at Reno and won the GBL Championship in their first season there in 2006, but suffered for their last two seasons in Western Nevada. Following the relocation of the AAA Pacific Coast League franchise the Reno Aces from Tucson, Arizona, in 2009, the team was purchased by Tucson Baseball owner Jay Zucker, relocated to Tucson and renamed the Tucson Toros. The Silver Sox team name (owned by the league) has since been given to the current Saskatchewan team in the AWL, which has no ties to the original Reno franchise, yet could adopt the team history.
Team name origin.
Unlike its GBL predecessor and name sake, the Silver Sox team name is based on the importance of the precious metal in Saskatchewan where significant silver ore deposits lie in the Canadian Shield in the eastern part of the province near Flin Flon, Manitoba. It is also a not too subtle hint that the summer professional Golden Baseball League, which already has teams in Victoria, Calgary, and Edmonton; would be very open to a new ownership group that would like to add an expansion team in Saskatoon or Regina for the 2010 season.
Attendance and possible relocation.
Supported by throngs of Saskatchewan residents wintering in Arizona, the Silver Sox roster is reflective of the diversity of the province with players from Canada, Korea, Japan, the U.S. and Latin America and is striving to bring a professional baseball championship back to Saskatchewan. The Silver Sox lead the average attendance in 2009 with approximately 1,200. 
Though nothing has been etched in stone, there has been talk between the GBL and a potential investor about bringing a franchise (possibly the Silver Sox) to play at Cairns Field in Saskatoon. The dedicated fan base did catch the attention of Golden Baseball League commissioner Kevin Outcalt. He said in an interview, "The Silver Sox are also a bit of a nod by the Golden League that we'd love to be up in Saskatchewan, too, in Saskatoon or in Regina or Moose Jaw, if we had the right ownership group and ballpark."

Josef Klehr

Josef Klehr (October 17, 1904, Langenau, Upper Silesia – August 23, 1988, Leiferde) was an SS-"Oberscharführer", supervisor in several Nazi concentration camps and head of the SS disinfection commando at Auschwitz concentration camp.
Life.
Klehr was born as the son of a teacher. After attending the Volksschule in Wohlau until 1918 he got an apprenticeship with a cabinet maker, passing the exam in 1921 that allowed him to do it by trade. As of 1934 he worked as a night porter in a community home, then subsequently as a nurse in a sanatorium. From 1938 he was assistant sergeant at Wohlau prison.
Klehr was a member of the Nazi Party and Allgemeine SS as of 1932. He participated in military exercises with the Wehrmacht and received training to become a medic. Shortly before the beginning of the war he was drafted into the Waffen-SS. In August 1939 he was transferred to Buchenwald concentration camp as a guard, then to Dachau concentration camp as a medical orderly a year later. In January, 1941 he was promoted to SS-Unterscharführer and transferred to Auschwitz, working as a medical orderly in the prisoners' infirmary.
Klehr was renowned for killing by phenol injections into the heart, something he essentially took over as of some time in 1942. He devised ways to optimise the speed of the killing process, such as experimenting with the positioning of prisoners before their injection. Klehr occasionally conducted selections himself, and when he was informed that the camp doctor was unavailable, stated immediately, "Today I am the camp doctor.” Due to various descriptions of him standing against a background of corpses "wearing either a white coat or “a pink-rubber apron and rubber gloves” and “holding a 20-cc hypodermic with a long needle” in his hands, Klehr has been described as the "ultimate caricature of the omnipotent Auschwitz doctor."
In 1943 Klehr became head of the disinfection squad ("Desinfektionskommando"). As a handler of Zyklon B his tasks included not only delousing living quarters and clothes, but direct involvement in the mass gassing of prisoners. Klehr was also one of those responsible for inserting the gas. He was present during selections where those incapable of working were sent to the gas chambers, and drew up a schedule as to who under him was to insert the Zyklon B.
On April 20, 1943 Klehr was awarded the War Merit Cross second class with swords. He was transferred to the Gleiwitz subcamp in 1944 where he was head of the prisoners' hospital and was medically responsible for Glewitz camps I to IV.
After the war.
Upon the evacuation of Auschwitz Klehr guarded prisoners being transported to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, after which he was taken under command by an SS combat unit. In the beginning of May 1945 he was taken prisoner in Austria by Americans and was held until 1948. He returned to his family in Braunschweig and resumed work as a cabinet maker. In April 1960 the Frankfurt prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant which was executed in September after Klehr's whereabouts was determined. On August 19, 1965 the court convicted him of murder in at least 475 cases, assistance in the joint murder of at least 2730 cases, and sentenced him to life imprisonment with an additional 15 years. The witness Glowacki testified in court that Klehr killed the women who survived the massacre after the alleged uprising at the Budy female subcamp by phenol injection. 
While in prison, Klehr was interviewed by journalist and film-maker Ebbo Demant. When Demant brings up Holocaust denial, Klehr says:
On January 25, 1988, Klehr's sentence was suspended due to unfitness for custody ("Vollzugsuntauglichkeit"), and on June 10 he was ordered to serve the remainder on probation. After seven months of freedom, Klehr died at the age of 83.

Western Canada Miners

The Western Canada Miners (also known as just the Canada Miners) are a professional independent baseball team based in Yuma, Arizona, and representing western Canada. They play in the developmental Arizona Winter League, a short-season instructional winter league affiliated with the North American League and they play their home games at Desert Sun Stadium in Yuma, as well as the San Diego Surf Dawgs, Saskatchewan Silver Sox, Team Canada and Yuma Scorpions. The team uses the logo and uniforms of the now-defunct Mesa Miners team and are owned by Diamond Sports & Entertainment.
On April 3, 2009, the Miners were announced as one of the three charter teams in the new Arizona Summer League, an instructional league also affiliated with the Golden Baseball League. The league was formed following the success of the AWL. In July 2009, after 14 games and no playoff, they were declared the very first ASL Champions. The ASL version was renamed the Bisbee Miners for 2010 and the Mesa Miners for 2011 and possibly beyond.
The NAL still owns the rights to the "Miners" brand (including name, logo and uniforms) and a future expansion team would have no ties to the original Mesa team. Some suggest that previously sought-after Canadian cities Kamloops and Kelowna should be the new home of the brand because of western Canada's rich mining history, similar to the Saskatchewan team (Regina or Saskatoon are being sought to host the Silver Sox if they continue to express interest).

Inglis Drever

Inglis Drever (1999-2009) was a champion racehorse trained in the North of England by Howard Johnson. He was one of the most successful hurdle racing horses to date and won the World Hurdle three times, matched only by the former champion Big Buck's. He is seen by many as having been the greatest staying hurdler of all time.
His career started as a Flat horse, where he was trained by Sir Mark Prescott and won 4 his 12 starts under Flat rules. His crowning achievement in that sphere being victory in the ultimate staying handicap at Newmarket, the Cesc.
It was over hurdles however that Inglis Drever excelled himself straight from the off, winning on his first run over hurdles in November 2003 at Aintree.
It was victory in the 'Fighting Fifth Hurdle' at Newcastle that had many believing that The Champion Hurdle was a serious prospect for this up and coming Legend.
However as on the flat he proved that The Staying game was his forte. Winning the very 1st running of the '2005 Ladbroke World Hurdle' Previous title of stayers Hurdle. Lowering the colours of Reigning two Time Champion Barracuda. 
Sadly after suffering a potential career threatening injury with a crashing fall at Newbury, Inglis Drever's was denied the chance to defend his title as injury meant that he was unable to run in the race in 2006. (My Way De Sulzen)
He did however return to the track and reclaimed 'The World Hurdle' crown in both 2007 and 2008. In 2008 he was the oldest horse at the time to win The World/Stayers Hurdle. he was ridden by three different jockeys on all three of his Cheltenham Festival wins.
Inglis Drever picked up a leg injury in the 'Long Distance Hurdle' at Newbury in November 2008.
His trainer Howard Johnson had reported him to be recovering well.
However, in January 2009, Inglis Drever was retired as a result of this injury.
Unfortunately he never got to enjoy retirement and was euthanised after suffering a bout of colic on October 16, 2009.

2-4 Family

2-4 Family was a rap/hip hop group, that formed in Germany in the late 1990s. The original line-up consisted of Jo O'Meara, Jay Dogg, Joseph Jazz and Essence Woods.
History.
Jay Dogg and Joseph Jazz met each other in the United States Army in 1989 and became friends. They were both DJs, but decided that Dogg would be the DJ and Jazz would be the rapper. As a duo, they entered many talent competitions. When visiting Germany in 1997, they came across Essence Woods at a party. Jo O'Meara was a friend of Woods, so the four of them formed the group 2-4 Family in 1998.
Career.
2-4 Family released their first single, "Stay", in mid-1998. The song featured lead female vocals from O'Meara, and rapping from the other three members. It peaked at #8 on the Viva Top 100. They released their album "Family Business" in March 1999. Along with other vocalists, 2-4 Family recorded "Hand in Hand for Children - Children of the World". A week after that had been released, "Stay" was re-released for Christmas. 2-4 Family also joined with other vocalists to release a cover version of Wham!'s famous single "Last Christmas" under the moniker Rap Allstars. 
Shortly after this, O'Meara successfully auditioned to become a part of the soon to be created pop group S Club 7 and left 2-4 Family, leaving the group with three members. Parklane Music received a demo of "Killing Me Softly", recorded by a girl named Joanna Biscardine. She soon joined the group, and 2-4 Family released their second single, "Lean on Me" in January 1999. It peaked at #9 on the Viva Top 100, and #69 on the UK Singles Chart. 
Two months later, 2-4 Family released their final album, "Family Business", which peaked at #54 on the Viva Top 100. The album contained twelve tracks, including various mixes of some of the songs. The final single by 2-4 Family was released in mid-1999, titled "Take Me Home".
Split.
The group went their separate ways in early 2000. Another band with the same name was formed, but with none of the five members that had once been a part of 2-4 Family. The recreation was not working and they soon disbanded after an unsuccessful single.

Baoguang Temple

The Baoguang Temple (Chinese: 宝光寺; pinyin: Bǎo Gūang Sì) is located in Xindu district 18 km north of Chengdu, Sichuan province, China. It was founded during the Tang Dynasty.
Temple.
The temples has a number of halls, including the Qing-era Arhat Hall, containing 500 two meter high clay figurines of Arhats. The temple also houses numerous treasures, including white jade Buddha from Burma and a stone tablet engraved with 1000 Buddhist figures.
Pagoda.
The temple's pagoda is the only part of the temple that still dates from the Tang dynasty. It was built between 862-888. It is square, has thirteen floors, and is 30 meters tall. The inside of the pagoda is solid, and one can not go inside. The first floor of the pagoda is quite tall compared to the upper floors. The upper floors all feature upturned eaves, with copper bells hanging from them. The top of the pagoda is gold-plated, and each of the four sides of every floor has an image of the Buddha inlaid in gold.
Shortly after the pagoda’s construction in the Tang Dynasty, the upper part of the pagoda partially collapsed. During the Ming Dynasty, the upper part of the pagoda was restored, but the seventh floor and those above were built tilted slightly towards the west, not according to the pagodas original proportions. As a result, the pagoda has a noticeable tilt.

Mattei sarcophagus I

The sarcophagus with hunting scenes, known as Mattei I, is an ancient Roman sarcophagus of the 3rd century, displayed at the palazzo Mattei in Rome. It is 1.31m high.
From the age of Caracalla onwards carved sarcophagus production shows a kind of reaction to the "pittoricism" of examples from the preceding era (late 2nd-early 3rd century), such as the Portona sarcophagus), with a return to richer plasticity, as is also documented in Roman portraiture between 215 and 250. Hugely influenced by their use in the eastern empire and the middle east, hunting scenes in Roman art had started to become popular in Hadrianic art and the popularity of their use on sarcophagi spread thanks to Caracalla's predilection for Alexander the Great and his hunts and - the Mattei example is one of the earliest with such scenes. The hunting scenes, with major influence from the eastern empire. In the Roman world it acquired a new meaning as a signifier of military values, as shown by the "Virtus-Roma" figure in Amazonian dress standing behind the mounted hunter in this scene. This mounted hunter has a physiognomic portrait (datable to between 220 and 230, by comparison with the style of the portrait of Caracalla) and hurls a spear towards a lion at the right. Beneath this lions paws is a fallen hunter with sword and shield, and under this lion is another, dead lion. To the left are two standing nude divinities, possibly the Dioscuri. To the right, above the live lion, is a beardless mounted hunter in a tunic and another nude standing figure.
The composition is very crowded, with overlapping figures in a scheme unknown in 2nd century classicism. The use of drilling and the abundant chiaroscuro of high relief are typical of the expressionism of the turn of the 2nd/3rd centuries, though the solid plasticity and consistency of the figures indicate a continuing classicism. This compositional pattern is repeated with little variation on later hunting sarcophagi.

Preflexes

Preflexes are the latent capacities in the musculoskeletal system that auto-stabilize movements through the use of the nonlinear visco-elastic properties of muscles when they contract. The term "preflex" for such a zero-delay, intrinsic feedback loop was coined by Loeb. Unlike stabilization methods using neurons such as reflexes and higher brain control, it happens with minimal time delay. Its chief disadvantage is that it works only to stabilize the main movements of the musculoskeletal system.
Visco-elastic correction.
Muscles possess nonlinear visco-elastic properties when they contract. This property can autocorrect movements when a muscle is forced to change its length, and at a velocity different from that with which it was originally commanded. Such automatic correction is useful when a commanded action is perturbated, for example, if a step goes into a hole as this causes the foot to unexpectedly stretch down. The nonlinear visco-elastic properties of muscles interact with these perturbation induced velocity and length differences such that they counteract directly, as they happen, the effects upon the body of the perturbation.
Evolutionary opportunity.
Muscles contain many different systems on which the evolutionary selection of preflex stabilization can operate. The deltoid muscle, for example, consists of at least seven segments with different bone attachments and neural control. Within each muscle segment, there exists a complex internal structure that goes down to one in which each muscle unit consists of a tendon, aponeurosis, and a fascicle of active contractile and passive elements. Another source of variation is in the internal architecture of the fiber orientation relative to a muscle’s line of action, for example, as found in pennate muscles. The complexities of the different visco-elastic length- and velocity-force relationships of these subparts provides the opportunity for the adaptive selection of structurally complex muscle biocomposites with highly task-tuned nonlinear visco-elastic length- velocity- force relationships. This nature of muscles to be composite structures thus provides the adaptive opportunity for evolution to modify the visco-elastic reactions of the musculoskeletal system so they counteract perturbations without the need for spinal or higher levels of control.
Examples.
Leg step recovery.
Helmeted Guineafowl like many other bipedal birds walk upon rough ground. When a guineafowl's leg steps into a hole (a common disruption against which evolution has tuned the nonlinear visco-elastic properties of its musculoskeletal system), a momentarily uncommanded velocity and length change in the muscles that span its leg joints occurs. This length/velocity discrepancy interacts with the nonlinear length and velocity-force relationships that have evolved in response to such a disruption with the result that the leg extends further into the hole, and thus keeps the bird’s body stable and upright.
Leg wiping.
It is the intrinsic musculoskeletal properties of a frog’s leg, not neurally mediated spinal reflexes, that stabilize its wiping movements at irritants when the leg movement is instigated.
Squat jumps.
A human example of a preflex stabilization occurs when a person explosively jumps up from a squat position, and the leg muscles act to provide a minimal time delay against perturbations from the vertical.

Sándor Egervári

Sándor Egervári (born 15 July 1950 in Pomáz, Hungary) is a Hungarian football manager. 
He attended the University of Physical Education in Budapest, and qualified as a football coach in 1983. He has since finished the UEFA A and B course, as well as the Pro license course. He has managed clubs to the domestic title and cup success.
Playing career.
1971–1972 Hungarian First Division – Spartacus S.E
1972–1981 Hungarian First Division – Budapest Honvéd and MTK VM
1974 Member of the national Olympic team
Management career.
Egervári's coaching career began as an assistant coach in Hungary's last appearance at a world cup. This was in the Mexico 1986 tournament, when Hungary were one of the best European sides in the world. He was assistant coach for the national team for three years in total.
He then had a two-year spell, as assistant coach, to the Kuwaiti national team from 1986–88. Egervári then returned home to Hungary, with a growing reputation as a top coach. He assisted József Both, for a season and then helped György Mezey, over the next two years at Honved, during the years 1988–91, where he helped the Budapest club to two titles among other successes. This was achieved with both managers, in the capacity of assistant manager. Honved also fared well in European competition during his time there.
With domestic success behind him, Egervári moved to the now extinct club, BVSC Budapest. He took over when they were bottom, but worked his magic with them. BVSC were league and cup runners-up in his successful time there. Egervári then spent a short time in Saudi Arabia, coaching Al-Ittihad, before the lure of further success in Hungary followed. In 1998, he took over at MTK and guided them to the title and Hungarian Cup success.
Dunaújváros FC (1999–2002).
One of his most notable successes followed when he moved to Dunaújváros in 1999. Once again his good coaching skills worked wonders and they were champions in his second season there. Dunaferr also enjoyed success in the European Cup, when they beat Hajduk Split on their journeys. The following season saw Egervári guide Dunaújváros to a runner-up spot.
MTK Hungária FC (2002–2004).
He then returned to Budapest to once again manage MTK. He brought them the championship in his first year there. MTK also won that year's Super Cup trophy to bring the good times back to the famous Budapest club.
Vasas SC (2004–2005).
A short stint in charge of Vasas SC then followed, before he packed his bags once more and headed back to Kuwait.
Al-Salmiya SC (2006–2007).
He took the Al Salmiya Club to third spot and also managed to help them finish in the top 4 of the GCC cup.
Győri ETO FC (2007–2008).
In 2007, Egervári headed to Győr, in Hungary, and took this club from close to bottom of the league to third spot, and qualification into the UEFA Cup. This was made even more special as it was the first time in 22 years that Győri ETO FC made it into Europe. He helped Győr beat Zestafoni of Georgia, over two legs, before meeting German giants VfB Stuttgart in the next round. His young Győr side suffered numerous injuries, with key captain Peter Stark, breaking his ribs, which resulted in him missing most of the season. Győr also suffered from fatigue after their involvement in the UEFA Cup, and the management of the club decided to do without his services in December 2008.
Hungary national under-20 football team (2009–2010).
Egervári spent a short period of six months out of the game, deciding to focus on improving his English language skills during that time. He did receive offers from clubs for his services, but felt that he needed to properly recharge his batteries. He then received an offer that he simply could not refuse. The then President of the Hungarian FA, Istvan Kisteleki, offered him the U20 national team manager's job, with little over a month before the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup finals in Egypt. He accepted, and began to work on his young squad with very little time allowed. Egervári once again proved his worth by guiding the little fancied Hungarians to a bronze medal position in the finals, which included big wins over the Italy national under-20 football team and Czech Republic national under-20 football team.
His young Hungarian side returned to Budapest airport amidst wild celebrations, with over a thousand people welcoming home his side. It was perhaps the best achievement from a Hungarian side since the FIFA World Cup 1954 finals in Switzerland. He took on the additional role of U21 team manager and defeated the Italian U21 side in Hungary with a 2–0 win. The U21's currently sit in second place, with every chance of qualifying for the London 2012 Olympic games.
Hungary national football team (2010–2013).
The departure of Dutchman Erwin Koeman resulted in Egervári being the obvious choice to manage the full Hungarian national side for the first time. He was officially appointed on 23 July 2010, with his first task being to take the Hungarian national side to England for a friendly at Wembley Stadium on 11August 2010. Once again he had being given the challenge of preparing his side with very little time, but as his success in Egypt with the U20 side showed, he was more than up to the challenge.
In the Euro 2012 qualifying Egervári debuted against Sweden by losing 2–0 in Stockholm on 3 September 2010. On home turf his debut was a 2–1 win against Moldova. In their third match the team crushed San Marino 8–0 at Puskás Ferenc Stadium. Their second away match was in Helsinki Olympic Stadium where Ádám Szalai scored the opening goal. Mikael Forssell equalized the result in the 88th minute, but Hungary still could win the match by a late goal by Balázs Dzsudzsák in the 94th minute.
In 2011 Hungary played their first match against Azerbaijan in Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai. In the 37th minute Gergely Rudolf scored a goal. The second goal was scored by Tamás Hajnal in the 81st minute. Hungary beat Azerbaijan 2–0 in a friendly match. The first match in the Euro 2012 Qualifiers was against the Netherlands at home in the Puskás Ferenc Stadium on 25 March 2011. Hungary was beaten by 4–1 in font of 23,817 supporters. The second match was for days later on 29 March 2011. Hungary was beaten by 5–3 in a thrilling match. Gergely Rudolf scored the equalizer (1–1), Gera Zoltán scored the second Hungarian goal (1–2) and the third goal (3–3). Finally, the Netherlands beat Hungary 5–3 in the Amsterdam Arena. In March 2011, Hungary was the third in their group. One of the most important success of Egervári's coaching career was the Euro 2012 qualifying between Hungary and Sweden. Due to the injuries of key people like Balázs Dzsudzsák, Roland Juhász, and Zoltán Gera nobody expected a victory against Sweden. On 2 September 2011, Szabics scored against Sweden at the Puskás Ferenc Stadium in the last minutes of the first half. However, Sweden equalized in the second half. A late goal by Szabics's fellow striker Gergely Rudolf resulted the celebration of 25,000 spectators after beating Sweden in the Euro 2012 qualifying by 2–1.
On 11 October 2013, Egervári resigned immediately after an 8–1 defeat against the Netherlands in Amsterdam in a penultimate game in the FIFA World Cup 2014 qualifying round, in which Hungary had the chance of securing a second place in Group D that could have entitled it to play-off games.
Management award.
Egervári has picked up many awards over his years as a top coach in both Hungary and the Middle East. He was manager of the year in 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2009.

Ancient Roman sarcophagi

In the funeral and burial practices of ancient Rome, elaborately carved marble and limestone sarcophagi were characteristic of elite inhumation from the 2nd to the 4th centuries AD. At least 10,000 Roman sarcophagi survive, with fragments possibly representing as many as 20,000. Although mythological scenes have been mostly widely studied, sarcophagus relief has been called the "richest single source of Roman iconography," and may also depict the deceased's occupation or life course, military scenes, and other subject matter. The same workshops produced sarcophagi with Jewish or Christian imagery. Early Christian sarcophagi produced from the late 3rd century onwards, represent the earliest form of large Christian sculpture, and are important for the study of Early Christian art.
History.
Cremation was the predominant means of disposing of remains in the Roman Republic. Ashes contained in cinerary urns and other monumental vessels were placed in tombs. From the 2nd century AD onward, inhumation became more common, and after the Roman Empire came under Christian rule, was standard practice.
Themes and imagery.
Details from sarcophagus reliefs
Personization.
Sarcophagi Personalization is the customization of a sarcophagus to display the attributes, achievements, or history of the deceased through art and/or inscriptions. 
Sarcophagus Of Lars Pulena.
The sculpted scene on the front of the coffin shows the deceased in the Underworld between two Charuns (Etruscan death demons) in which signified that his journey to the afterlife was successful. On the lid, Pulena is shown laid across, in a reclining position, resting on his left arm and in front of him, a list of his life’s achievements which were inscribed on an open scroll.
Melfi Sarcophagus.
The Asiatic sarcophagus with kline portrait of a woman also carried an Etruscan influence of sculpting portraiture on the lid. Made of marble, with reliefs on all four sides of the box (a feature in Eastern Sarcophagi production), and sculpted mini statues of Greek gods and heroes in frames are depicted. The lid displays a portrait of the woman with Cupid (right end) and a little dog (in which the paws only remain at the left end). 
Battle of Romans and barbarians.
The unusually large Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus shows a chaotic battle scene between the Romans and barbarian foes. At the centre, a young general wears no helmet nor wields any weapon and has emblem of Mithras, the Persian god of light, truth, and victory over death carved into his forehead. Several scholars have identified him as one of the sons of Trajan Decius, who died of plague.
Santa Maria Antiqua Sarcophagus.
A sarcophagus from the church of Santa Maria Antiqua with philosopher, orant, and Old and New Testament scenes is Early Christian art in which displays the story of Jonah on the left one-third, heads of a praying woman and a seated man reading from a scroll which are unfinished (intended to be portraits of the deceased) in the center, and continuing on, Christ as Good Shepherd, and the baptism of Christ.

Lesnewth Hundred

Lesnewth Hundred is one of the former hundreds of Cornwall, Trigg was to the south-west and Stratton Hundred to the north-east. Tintagel, Camelford, Boscastle, and Altarnun were in the Hundred of Lesnewth as well as Lesnewth which is now only a hamlet but in Celtic times was the seat of a Celtic chieftain who ruled the whole of Trigg.
The division into hundreds is thought to date from the reign of King Athelstan and at the time of the Domesday Survey the internal order of manors in the Exeter Domesday Book for Cornwall is in most cases based on the hundreds to which they belonged (though the hundred names are not used). In the Geld Inquest of 1083 only seven hundreds are found, identified by the names of the chief manors: Connerton, Winnianton, Pawton, Tybesta, Stratton, Fawton and Rillaton. Here Stratton represents a single hundred including the later Stratton, Lesnewth and Trigg.

Alessandra Melucco Vaccaro

Alessandra Melucco Vaccaro (4 April 1940, Rome - 29 August 2000, Rome) was an Italian historian and archaeologist. Her main activity was in the three fields in which she made significant innovations - the High Middle Ages, archaeological restoration, and environment and landscape. President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi conferred the Medaglia d'Oro for culture and art in Vaccaro's memory in February 2001. 
Personal life.
Alessandra Vaccaro was born at Rome on 4 April, 1940 to a notable middle class Roman family. Her grandfather, Michelangelo Vaccaro, was a university professor who wrote a text fundamental to criminal anthropology and became a senator and head of cabinet under the Crispi government. Her father was a chemist who was an international expert on prophylaxis, and her mother, Emerenziana, was director of the Istituto di Patologia del Libro. In 1965 she married Gianfranco Melucco, a lawyer. 
Career.
Vaccaro enrolled in the literature faculty of La Sapienza university at Rome, where she studied Greek and Roman archaeology under Ranccio Bianci Bandinelli, and specialised in archaeology at the Scuola Nazionale di Archeologia. 
In 1962 to 1963, Vaccaro took part in excavations at the Etruscan sanctuary of Pyrgi (today S. Severa) and at the Centro Sperimentale di Archeologia Sottomarina. From 1964 she won a bursary to study at the Scuola Archeologica Italiana di Atene and, in 1965, she worked on the publication of the Annuario di Storia dell'Arte edited by the Biblioteca di Archeologia e Storia dell'Arte di Roma, and took charge of a sector of the excavation at Pyrgi, and the publication of the 'vernice nera' and Hellenistic pottery. 
Vaccaro joined the Amministrazione delle Antiquita e Belle Arti in 1965, where she directed a series of excavations including, from 1970 to 1974, those at the Duomo Vecchio di Arezzo and, in 1971, those at the Longobardi necropolis of Chuisi-Arcisi. Here she widened her interests to take on the reorganisation and restoration of the Roman portraits in the Museo Archaeologico di Firenze; the High Medieval era was a decidedly pioneering field of research at that time. 
She also moved to Rome in 1971 to the Istituto Centrale del Restauro (ICR) and in 1974 was made director of the Museo dell'Alto Medioevo, where she extended the museum's publications along this innovative new line of interest, publications which included the "Corpus della Scultura Altomedievale" and "I Longobardi in Italia", which remain valid reference works today. Further, she introduced the discipline of the High Medieval Era amongst university disciplines which led to it being taught more widely. 
From 1976 to 1979 Vaccaro was elected to the Italian Parliament as a backbench Partito Comunista Italiano MP. Upon leaving parliament she was appointed Sopraintendente Aggiunto and Archeologico at the Minstero dei Beni Culturali e Ambiental (MBCA) as well as becoming director of the Servizio Beni Archeologico at ICR, where her broad scientific interests allowed her to take on many themes put in place innovative and competent restoration projects 
These included directing research into and restoration of the principal marble monuments in Italy dating from the classical era of Rome : 
During the fifteen years she spent at ICR, the innovations she brought to archaeological work were published widely , including works on the conservation of stone, architectural patinas and polychromy of ancient monuments. Her work on restauration and 'maintenance programmes' formed the basis for the 'Carta del Rischio del Patrimonio Culturale Italiano'. At this time Vaccaro also contributed to setting up and teaching numerous new courses integrating archaeology and restoration at several universities in Italy. 
In 1994 she was in charge of the technical service dealing with international relations and great risks to the environment and landscape at the Minstero dei Beni ed Attivita Culturale, and instigated research into natural and anthropogenic risks to the environment and landscape particularly in respect of archaeological zones such as Pompeii. 
Vaccaro also represented Italy in international groups such as the National Work Group for the UNESCO World Heritage List and the Bureau du Conseil de la Cooperation Culturelle of the Council of Europe, amongst her many other national and international roles

Nicholas (Nick) Arthur Folland (born 17 September 1963, Bristol) is a former first-class cricketer, who represented Somerset County Cricket Club between 1992 and 1994.
Folland came into county cricket unusually late; following success at Minor Counties level with Devon, he was persuaded by Somerset that he could combine his teaching with a professional cricket career and made his debut in regular first-class cricket in 1992, at the age of 28. He had played one match earlier for the Minor Counties representative side against the Indian tourists in 1990.
Folland went on to play 32 first-class matches and 68 at List A level. The highlight of his career was the two first-class centuries in a match that he made in 1993 against Sussex. These turned out to be the only two first-class hundreds of his career, and he left regular cricket midway through the 1994 season, deciding, according to Wisden, that "regular first-class cricket was not for him".
His brother, Neil, taught at Haberdashers' Aske's Boys School, with his Devon team mate, Doug Yeabsley.
He is now Headmaster of St John's on the Hill Prep School Chepstow.

<doc id="20592880" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20592880" title="Mu‘assel">
Mu‘assel

Mu‘assel ( which means "honeyed"), or shisha, is a syrupy tobacco mix containing molasses and vegetable glycerol which is smoked in a hookah.
Shisha (شيشة), from the Persian word shīshe (شیشه), meaning glass, is the common term for the hookah itself in Egypt, Sudan and the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf (including Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, UAE, and Saudi Arabia), and in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Somalia and Yemen. Initial traces of hookah smoking have been found in the North Western provinces of India in the states of Rajasthan and Gujarat.
Typical flavors of mu‘assel include apple, grape, guava, lemon, mint, as well as many other fruit based mixes. Unusual flavors, including white gummy bear, blueberry muffin, and Powerbull flavor (similar to the flavor of a Red Bull energy drink), have been introduced in recent years.
Culture.
Middle East.
Arab world.
In many places in the Arab world, the smoking of shisha is a part of traditional culture, and is considered a social custom. Social smoking is typically done with the use of a hookah with a single or double hose, but some hookahs can employ four or more hoses. When the smoker is finished, the hose is either placed back on the table, signifying that it is available, or is handed directly to the next user. Social convention dictates that the mouthpiece and hose should be folded back on itself in such a way that the mouthpiece is not pointing at the recipient.
Most cafés in the Middle East offer shishas. Cafés are widespread and are amongst the chief social gathering places in the Arab world (akin to public houses in Britain). Some expatriate residents arriving in the Middle East frequent shisha cafés in lieu of pubs in the region, especially where prohibition is in place and alcohol is not served.
The Levant.
In the Levant (the Palestinian territories, Israel, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon), shisha (referred to as 'nargila') is widely used, and its availability is nearly universal. Shisha has become part of the culture. Smokers are often seen on the side of the streets, parks, bus stops, and other public venues. Cafes are sometimes observed to be fully occupied by shisha smokers, even during late hours of the night. It is not uncommon to see a female smoking shisha. In the Levant, it is very social, and the activity is often accompanied by a game of Tawla (Backgammon), cards, or tea.
Iran.
In Iran, the hookah is known as a ḡalyān (Persian: قليان, قالیون, غلیون, also spelled "ghalyan", "ghalyaan" or "ghelyoon"). It is similar in many ways to the Arabic hookah but also differs in several ways. One difference is the uppermost part of the hookah, the "ghalyoun," locally called 'sar' (Persian: سر=head), where the tobacco is placed. Compared to Turkish hookahs, the Iranian version tends to be somewhat larger. Additionally, the majority of the hose is flexible and covered with soft silk or cloth, while Turkish hookahs often have mouthpieces and partially rigid hoses which are as long as or longer than the flexible part of the hose.
Each smoker will typically carry their own personal mouthpiece (called an Amjid) (امجید). The amjid is a detachable hookah mouthpiece, and is usually made of wood or metal and can be decorated with valuable or other stones. Amjids are considered to be decorative and are a highly personal item. Public smoking venues will often carry disposable or cleanable amjid for the use of smokers who do not carry their own.
The exact date of the first use of ḡalyān in Persia is not known. According to Cyril Elgood, it was Abu’l-Fatḥ Gīlānī, a Persian physician at the court of the Mughal emperor Akbar I, who "first passed the smoke of tobacco through a small bowl of water to purify and cool the smoke and thus invented the hubble-bubble or hookah." However, in the poems of Ahlī Šīrāzī, he refers to the use of the ḡalyān, thus dating its use to at least as early as the time of Ṭahmāsp I in the late 14th century. It seems, therefore, that Abu’l-Fatḥ Gīlānī should be credited with the introduction of the ḡalyān, already in use in Persia, to India.
Although the Safavid Shah ʿAbbās I strongly condemned tobacco use, towards the end of his reign smoking ḡalyān and čopoq (q.v.) had become common on every level of society. In schools and learned circles, both teachers and students had ḡalyāns during lessons. Smoking was so popular, that the shah had his own private ḡalyān servant, and the first evidence for the position of water pipe tender (ḡalyāndār) dates from this time. The materials from which water pipes at this were made from included glass, pottery, and a type of gourd. Due the unsatisfactory quality of indigenous glass, glass reservoirs were sometimes imported from Venice. In the time of Shah Solaymān in the late 15th and early 16th century, ḡalyāns became more elaborately embellished as their use increased. The wealthy owned gold and silver pipes, and even the general population spent more on ḡalyāns than they did on the basic necessities of life. An emissary of Shah Sultan Husayn, to the court of Louis XV in the early 16th century, on his way to the royal audience at Versailles, had in his retinue an officer holding his ḡalyān, which he used while his carriage was in motion. We have no record indicating the use of ḡalyān at the court of Nāder Shah Afšār, although its use seems to have continued uninterrupted. There are portraits of Karīm Khan Zand and Fatḥ-ʿAlī Shah Qājār which depict them smoking the ḡalyān.
Iranians had a special tobacco called "Khansar" (خانسار, presumably name of the origin city). With Khansar, coals would be put on the Khansar without foil. Khansar has less smoke than the normal tobacco.
Caucasus.
Azerbaijan.
It is one of the popular entertainment and hangout activities, mostly among youngsters and men in Azerbaijan, especially in Baku.
South Asia.
Pakistan.
Although it is traditionally prevalent in rural areas for generations, hookahs have become very popular in the cosmopolitan cities.
India.
The concept of hookah is thought to have originated in India once the province of the wealthy, it was tremendously popular especially during Mughal rule. The hookah has since become less popular; however, it is once again garnering the attention of the masses, and cafés and restaurants that offer it as a consumable are popular. The use of hookahs from ancient times in India was not only a custom, but a matter of prestige. Rich and landed classes would smoke hookahs.
Tobacco is smoked in hookahs in many villages as per traditional customs. Smoking a tobacco-molasses shisha is now becoming popular amongst the youth in India. There are several chain clubs, bars and coffee shops in India offering a wider variety of mu‘assels, including non-tobacco versions.Hookah was recently banned in Bangalore. However it can be bought or rented for personal usage or organised parties only. 
Koyilandy, a small fishing town on the west coast of India, once made and exported hookahs extensively. These are known as Malabar Hookhas or Koyilandy Hookahs. Today these intricate hookahs are difficult to find outside of Koyilandy and not much easier to find in Koyilandy itself.
As hookah makes a resurgence in India, there have been numerous raids and bans recently on hookah smoking, especially in Gujarat
Nepal.
"Hookahs" (हुक़्क़ा), especially wooden ones, are popular in Nepal. Hookah usage is considered to symbolize family elitism historically. Today, however, hookahs have become popular among tourists and young people. 
Bangladesh.
Hookah, as the traditional smoking contraption, has been commonly used in Bangladesh since the Mughal ages. But flavored Shisha was introduced to Bangladesh in the early 2000s. Shisha became very popular among the young crowds, and shisha bars and lounges opened up in large numbers to cater to those crowds. However, due to health concerns and unregulated consumption, the government banned shisha in late 2010. Shisha lounges were ordered to shut down. Very few shisha lounges were given permission to continue business, as they mostly served to foreigners.
Southeast Asia.
Philippines.
In the Philippines, the Hookah or Shisha was particularly used within the minority Arab Filipino communities and Indian Filipino, although particularly among indigenous Muslim Filipinos, a historical following of social and cultural trends set in the Middle East led to the Hookah being a rare albeit prestige social-habit of noblemen in important trade cities such as Cotabato or Jolo.
Hookah was virtually unknown by Christian Filipinos before the latter 20th century, yet the popularity among contemporary younger Christians is now vastly growing. In the capital's most cosmopolitan city, Makati; various high-end bars and clubs offer hookahs to patrons.
Although hookah use has been common for hundreds of years and enjoyed by people of all ages, it has just begun to become a youth-oriented pastime in Asia in recent times. Hookahs are most popular with college students and young adults, who may be underage and thus unable to purchase cigarettes.
South Africa.
In South Africa, hookah, colloquially known as a "hubbly bubbly", "hub", or an "okka pipe", is popular amongst the Cape Malay and Indian populations, wherein it is smoked as a social pastime. However, hookah is seeing increasing popularity with white South Africans, especially the youth. Bars that additionally provide hookahs are becoming more prominent, although smoking is normally done at home or in public spaces such as beaches and picnic sites.
In South Africa, the terminology of the various hookah components also differ from other countries. The clay
"head/bowl" is known as a "clay pot". The hoses are called "pipes" and the air release valve is known, strangely, as a "clutch".
Some scientists point to the dagga pipe as an African origin of hookah.
United States and Canada.
During the 1960s and 1970s, hookahs were a popular tool for the consumption of various derivations of tobacco, among other things. At parties or small gatherings the hookah hose was passed around with users partaking as they saw fit.
Recently, certain cities, counties, and states have implemented indoor smoking bans. In some jurisdictions, hookah businesses can be exempted from the policies through special permits. Some permits, however, have requirements such as the business earning a certain minimum percentage of their revenue from alcohol or tobacco.
In cities with indoor smoking bans, hookah bars have been forced to close or switch to tobacco-free mu‘assel. In many cities though, hookah lounges have been growing in popularity. From the year 2000 to 2004, over 200 new hookah cafés opened for business, most of them targeted at young adults and located near college campuses or cities with large Middle-Eastern communities. This activity continues to gain popularity within the post-secondary student demographic.
According to a 2011 study, 40.3 percent of college and university students surveyed had smoked tobacco from a hookah.
Health effects.
A 2008 study on hookah smoking and cancer in Pakistan found that serum CEA levels in ever/exclusive hookah smokers were higher than in non-smokers and lower than in cigarette smokers. The study also concluded that heavy hookah smoking (2–4 daily preparations; 3–8 sessions a day; 2 to 6 hours net daily smoking time) substantially raises CEA levels.

He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, which was awarded to recognize extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership by Nazi Germany during World War II. He was also one of only 631 men to be awarded the rare Close Combat Clasp in Gold.
Kämpfe, the commander of the III. Battalion, 4th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment "Der Führer", 2nd SS Panzer Division "Das Reich", was captured by the French Resistance on 9 June 1944 by a group headed by Jean Canou. Canou then placed him in the custody of Georges Guingouin.
The following day Kämpfe was executed on the orders of Guingouin or killed during his attempt to escape.
When it was clear that Kämpfe had been kidnapped, the Germans sent out forces to try to locate him. Among these was a unit under the command of Adolf Diekmann, I. Battalion, 4th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment. On 10 June 1944, Diekmann was given information regarding Kämpfe by two members of the Milice, French Vichy-controlled paramilitaries which collaborated with the Germans . Kämpfe was the highest-ranking officer ever to be captured by the Resistance. . His execution was to be a big event. That same day, Diekmann's battalion went to nearby Oradour-sur-Glane and massacred most of its inhabitants.

Early Christian sarcophagi

Early Christians sarcophagi are those Ancient Roman sarcophagi carrying inscriptions or carving relating them to early Christianity. They were produced from the late 3rd century through to the 5th century. They represent the earliest form of large Christian sculpture, and are important for the study of Early Christian art.
The production of Roman sarcophagi with carved decoration spread due to the gradual abandonment of the rite of cremation in favour of inhumation over the course of the 2nd century throughout the empire. However, burial in such sarcophagi was expensive and thus reserved for wealthy families. The end of the Christian persecutions desired by Gallienus in 260 began a period of peace for the Christians that lasted until the end of that century and allowed Christianity to spread in the army, in senior administrative posts and even the emperor's circles. In the second half of the 3rd century, especially due to increased demand from this group of wealthy Christians, the use of sarcophagi spread widely, with plastic treatments following trends in contemporary sculpture.
Production and typology.
The sarcophagi seem to have been produced by workshops who also created pieces with pagan or Jewish iconography. The techniques are the same, but Christian sarcophagi developed a rather different style of layout, with framed scenes, later arranged on two tiers. The images of Christ move in an iconic direction, very unlike the depiction of gods in pagan equivalents, where deities are normally shown, if at all, in narrative scenes. 
Iconography.
A wide variety of subjects are shown on sarcophagi, with the most elaborate containing small cycles of narrative scenes from the gospels and simpler ones symbols such as the Chi Rho. Other motifs depicted include the Hetoimasia, a representation of the empty throne with a book as preparation for the Last Judgment, the Traditio Legis or "giving of the law", with the scroll of the New Covenant given to St. Peter with St. Paul on the other side of Christ, and Christ in Majesty ("Maiestas domini")- representations of the majesty of the lord ranging from visions of prophets to Christ on a throne between the apostles with his feet on a footstool

He was born in New England and moved to King's County in Nova Scotia at a young age. In 1772, he married Amelia Bishop. Around the same time, Dickson settled in Onslow. He served as registrar of deeds for Colchester County from 1777 to 1796 and was also a justice of the peace. During a visit to the West Indies in 1796, he contracted yellow fever and died at Halifax on his return.
His sons Thomas, Robert and William became members of the provincial assembly. His daughter Elizabeth married Samuel George William Archibald. His daughter Eunice married John Chipman.

Portonaccio sarcophagus

The Portonaccio sarcophagus is a 2nd-century ancient Roman sarcophagus found in the Portonaccio quarter of Rome and now held at the Museo Nazionale Romano (palazzo Massimo). Dating to between 190 and 200, it was used for the burial of a Roman general involved in the campaigns of Marcus Aurelius and shows influences similar to those of the Column of Marcus Aurelius.
The sarcophagus is one of a group of about twenty-five late Roman battle sarcophagi, with one exception all apparently dating to 170-210, made in Rome or in some cases Athens. These derive from Hellenistic monuments from Pergamon in Asia Minor showing Pergamene victories over the Gauls, and were all presumably commissioned for military commanders. The Portonaccio sarcophagus is the best known and most elaborate of the main Antonine group, and shows both considerable similarities to the Great Ludovisi sarcophagus, the late outlier from about 250, and a considerable contrast in style and mood.
The face of the general is unfinished, either because the sculptors awaited a model to work from, or they had produced the work speculatively with no specific commission. The general and his wife are also each shown twice on the lid frieze, together holding each other's hands at the centre, and singly at the ends, again with unfinished faces. Pairs of figures of an older man and a woman stand beneath trophies at either end of the main face, uninvolved in the battle. These are at the same scale as the general, and all other the battling figures are smaller; indeed, in defiance of any attempt at perspective, the soldiers and horses at the "front" of the scene in the lower part are somewhat smaller than their equivalents at the "back" in the upper part.

Vitamin K deficiency

Vitamin K deficiency is a form of avitaminosis resulting from insufficient vitamin K1 or vitamin K2 or both.
Vitamin K1 Deficiency.
Vitamin K1-deficiency may occur by disturbed intestinal uptake (such as would occur in a bile duct obstruction), by therapeutic or accidental intake of a vitamin K1-antagonist such as warfarin, or, very rarely, by nutritional vitamin K1 deficiency. As a result, Gla-residues are inadequately formed and the Gla-proteins are insufficiently active.
Symptoms.
Symptoms include ecchymosis, petechiae, hematomas, oozing of blood at surgical or puncture sites, stomach pains; risk of massive uncontrolled bleeding; cartilage calcification; and severe malformation of developing bone or deposition of insoluble calcium salts in the walls of arteries. 
In infants, it can cause some birth defects such as underdeveloped face, nose, bones, and fingers.
Vitamin K2 Deficiency.
According to a study published in the October 14, 2008 edition of PLoS Medicine, Vitamin K1 (5 mg of K1/day) does not protect against age-related decreasing bone density, but may protect against fractures and cancers, in postmenopausal women taking calcium and vitamin D supplements.
Menaquinone (vitamin K2), but not phylloquinone (vitamin K1), intake is associated with reduced risk of CHD mortality, all-cause mortality and severe aortic calcification.
Prevalence.
The prevalence of vitamin K deficiency varies by geographic region.
For infants in the United States, vitamin K1 deficiency without bleeding may occur in as many as 50% of infants younger than 5 days old. Therefore, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that 0.5 to 1.0 mg Vitamin K1 be administered to all newborns shortly after birth.
Postmenopausal and elderly women in Thailand have high risk of Vitamin K2 deficiency, compared with the normal value of young, reproductive females.
Current dosage recommendations for Vitamin K may be too low.
The deposition of calcium in soft tissues, including arterial walls, is quite common, especially in those suffering from atherosclerosis, suggesting that Vitamin K deficiency is more common than previously thought.

Rafflesia schadenbergiana is a parasitic plant species of the genus "Rafflesia". Known as ""bó-o"" to the Bagobo tribe and ""kolon busaw"" to the Higaonon tribe of Bukidnon, it has the largest flower among the "Rafflesia" species found in the Philippines with a diameter ranging from 52-80 centimeters. It has also the second largest flower in the genus after "R. arnoldii".
This species was first collected in the vicinity of Mount Apo, Mindanao during an expedition led by Schadenberg and Koch in 1882. It was not seen for more than a century and was assumed to be extinct until Pascal Lays found a specimen of this species in South Cotabato in 1994 while studying the Tasaday. A population of this rare "Rafflesia" species was recently discovered in Baungon, Bukidnon, just outside of the buffer zone of the Mount Kitanglad Natural Park in 2007.

Parallel-TEBD

The parallel-TEBD is a version of the TEBD algorithm adapted to run on multiple hosts. The task of parallelizing "TEBD" could be achieved in various ways. 
This article introduces the conceptual basis of the implementation, using "MPI"-based pseudo-code for exemplification, while not restricting itself to MPI - the same basic schema could be implemented with the use of home-grown messaging routines.
Introduction.
The TEBD algorithm is a good candidate for parallel computing because the exponential operators used to calculate the time-evolution factorize under the Suzuki-Trotter expansion. A detailed presentation of the way TEBD works is given in the main article. Here we concern ourselves only with its parallel implementation.
Implementation.
For our purposes, we will use the canonical form of the MPS as introduced by Guifré Vidal in his original papers. Hence, we will write the function of state formula_1 as:
formula_2
This function describes a N-point lattice which we would like to compute on P different compute nodes. Let us suppose, for the sake of simplicity, that N=2k*P, where k is an integer number. This means that if we distribute the lattice points evenly among the compute nodes (the easiest scenario), an even number of lattice points 2k is assigned to each compute node. Indexing the lattice points from 0 to N-1 (note that the usual indexing is 1,N) and the compute nodes from 0 to P-1, the lattice points would be distributed as follows among the nodes:
Using the canonical form of the MPS, we define formula_3 as "belonging" to node m if m*2k ≤ l ≤ (m+1)*2k - 1. Similarly, we use the index l to assign the formula_4 to a certain lattice point. This means that 
formula_5, belong to NODE 0, as well as formula_6. A parallel version of TEBD implies that the computing nodes need to exchange information among them. The information exchanged will be the MPS matrices and singular values lying at the border between neighbouring compute nodes. How this is done, it will be explained below.
The TEBD algorithm divides the exponential operator performing the time-evolution into a sequence of two-qubit gates of the form:
formula_7
Setting the Planck constant to 1, the time-evolution is expressed as:
formula_8
Already for computing the first gate, process "m" needs information from its lowest neighbour, "m-1". On the other side, "m" doesn't need anything from its "higher" neighbour, "m+1", because it has all the information it needs to apply the last gate. So the best strategy for "m" is to send a request to "m-1", postponing the calculation of the first gate for later, and continue with the calculation of the other gates. What "m" does is called non-blocking communication. Let's look at this in detail. The tensors involved in the calculation of the first gate are:

Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus

The Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus is a marble Early Christian sarcophagus used for the burial of Junius Bassus, who died in 359. It has been described as "probably the single most famous piece of early Christian relief sculpture." The sarcophagus was originally placed in or under Old St. Peter's Basilica, was rediscovered in 1597, and is now below the modern basilica in the Museo Storico del Tesoro della Basilica di San Pietro (Museum of Saint Peter's Basilica) in the Vatican. The base is approximately 4 x 8 x 4 feet. 
Together with the Dogmatic sarcophagus in the same museum, this sarcophagus is one of the oldest surviving high-status sarcophagi with elaborate carvings of Christian themes, and a complicated iconographic programme embracing the Old and New Testaments.
Junius Bassus.
Junius Bassus was an important figure, a senator who was in charge of the government of the capital as praefectus urbi when he died at the age of 42 in 359. His father had been Praetorian prefect, running the administration of a large part of the Western Empire. Bassus served under Constantius II, son of Constantine I. Bassus, as the inscription on the sarcophagus tells us, converted to Christianity shortly before his death - perhaps on his deathbed. Many still believed, like Tertullian, that it was not possible to be an emperor and a Christian, which also went for the highest officials like Bassus.
Style.
The style of the work has been greatly discussed by art historians, especially as its date is certain, which is unusual at this period. All are agreed that the workmanship is of the highest quality available at the time, as one might expect for the tomb of such a prominent figure. 
The sarcophagus in many respects shows fewer features of the Late Antique style of sculpture typified in the Arch of Constantine of several decades earlier: "The sculpture ignores practically all the rules obeyed by official reliefs. Some figures are portrayed frontally, but certainly not all, and they are not shown in a thoroughly Late Antique manner; the scenes are three-dimensional and have depth and background ... drapery hangs on recognizable human forms rather than being arranged in predetermined folds; heads are varied, portraying recognisably different people." The sarcophagus has been seen as reflecting a blending of late Hellenistic style with the contemporary Roman or Italian one, seen in the "robust" proportions of the figures, and their slightly over-large heads. 
The setting in the niches casts the figures against a background of shadow, giving "an emphatic chiaroscuro effect" - an effect much more noticeable in the original than the cast shown here, which has a more uniform and lighter colour. The cast also lacks the effects created by light on polished or patinated highlights such as the heads of the figures, against the darker recessed surfaces and backgrounds.
Ernst Kitzinger finds "a far more definite reattachment to aesthetic ideals of the Graeco-Roman past" than in the earlier Dogmatic Sarcophagus and that of the "Two Brothers", also in the Vatican Museums. The form continues the increased separation of the scenes; it had been an innovation of the earliest Christian sarcophagi to combine a series of incidents in one continuous (and rather hard to read) frieze, and also to have two registers one above the other, but these examples show a trend to differentiate the scenes, of which the Junius Bassus is the culmination, producing a "multitude of miniature stages", which allow the spectator "to linger over each scene", which was not the intention of earlier reliefs which were only "shorthand pictographs" of each scene, only intended to identify them. He notes a "lyrical, slightly sweet manner" in the carving, even in the soldiers who lead St Peter to his death, which compares to some small carvings from the Hellenized east in the Cleveland Museum of Art, though they are several decades older. Even allowing for "the gradual appropriation of a popular type of Christian tomb by upper-class patrons whose standards asserted themselves increasingly both in the content and in the style of these monuments", Kitzinger concludes that the changes must reflect a larger "regeneration" in style.
Iconography.
The carvings are in high relief on three sides of the sarcophagus, allowing for its placement against a wall. The column and many parts of the figures are carved completely in the round. The arrangement of relief scenes in rows in a columnar framework is an introduction from Asia Minor at about this time. No portrait of the deceased is shown, though he is praised in lavish terms in an inscription; instead, the ten niches are filled with scenes from both the New and Old Testaments, plus one, the "Traditio Legis", that has no Scriptural basis. 
The scenes on the front are:
The tiny spandrels above the lower row show scenes with all participants depicted as lambs: on either side of Christ entering Jerusalem are the "Miracle of the loaves and fishes" and the "Baptism of Jesus". The other scenes may be the "Three youths in the fiery furnace", the "Raising of Lazarus", "Moses receiving the tablets" and "Moses striking the rock".
The sides have more traditional Roman scenes of the Four Seasons represented by putti performing seasonal tasks such as harvesting grapes. On a damaged plaque surmounting the lid is a poem praising Bassus in largely secular terms, and the inscription running along the top of the body of the sarcophagus identifies him, and describes him as a "neophyte", or recent convert. Further small reliefs on the lid, and heads at the corners, are badly damaged, they showed scenes of feasts and a burial procession typical of pagan sarcophagi; it is possible the lid was not created to match the base.
Scenes with Christ.
The emphasis on scenes of judgement may have been influenced by the career of Bassus as a magistrate, but all the scenes shown can be paralleled in other Christian works of the period.
In all the three scenes where he appears Christ is a youthful, beardless figure with shortish hair (though longer than that of other figures), which is typical of Christian art at this period. The angel standing behind Abraham in the Sacrifice of Isaac is depicted similarly, and without wings. Christ appears in the centre of both rows; in the top row as a law-giver or teacher between his chief followers, Peter and Paul (the "Traditio Legis"), and on the bottom entering Jerusalem. Both scenes borrow from pagan Roman iconography: in the top one Jesus is sitting with his feet on a billowing cloak representing the sky, carried by Caelus, the classical personification of the heavens. Christ hands Peter a scroll, probably representing the Gospels, as emperors were often shown doing to their heirs, ministers or generals. 
Before Pilate Christ also carries a scroll, like a philosopher. Pilate, perhaps worried by Jesus's reputation for miracles, is making the gesture Italians still use to ward off the evil eye. Pilate has a mild and passive appearance, contrasting strongly with the powerful and determined expression of the figure in low relief profile behind him on the wall, the only figure in these scenes depicted in this style and technique. If he is not just one of Pilate's subordinate officers, he may be intended as a portrait or statue of the emperor; Roman official business was usually conducted before such an image, upon which (under the deified pagan emperors) any oaths required were made. 
The lower scene loosely follows the entry ("adventus") of an emperor to a city, a scene often depicted in Imperial art; Christ is "identified as imperator by the imperial eagle of victory" in the conch moulding above the scene. There was already a tradition, borrowed from pagan iconography, of depicting "Christ the Victor"; in this work that theme is linked to the Passion of Jesus, of which the entry to Jerusalem is the start, a development that was to play a great part in shaping the Christian art of the future. 
The inclusion of the pagan figure of Caelus may seem strange, but he was not an important figure in Ancient Roman religion, so was evidently considered as a harmless pictorial convention by the Christian designer of the composition, as well as one of the elements showing continuity with Roman tradition. From the following century personifications of the River Jordan often appear in depictions of the Baptism of Jesus, and the manuscript Chronography of 354, just a few years older than the sarcophagus and made for another elite Christian, is full of personifications of cities, months and other concepts. The putti in the Chronography also relate closely to those on the sides of the sarcophagus.
Other scenes.
The Old Testament scenes depicted were chosen as precursors of Christ's sacrifice in the New Testament, in an early form of typology. Adam and Eve are shown covering their nakedness after the Fall of Man, which created the original sin and hence the need for Christ to be sacrificed for our sins. Adam and Eve themselves made no sacrifices, but behind Eve is a lamb, and beside Adam a sheaf of wheat, referring to the sacrifices of their two sons, Cain and Abel. Just to the right of the middle is Daniel in the lion's den, saved by his faith, and on the left is Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac. Job is seen at the point when he has lost everything, but retains his faith; his wife and a "comforter" look on anxiously. Christians saw these as foreshadowings of the sacrifice of God's only son, Jesus, though the Crucifixion itself, a rare subject up until the 5th century, is not depicted. 
The scenes prior to the martyrdoms of Peter and Paul, both common in Early Christian art, show the same avoidance of the climactic moments which were usually chosen in later Christian art. But they demonstrate to the viewer how the heavenly crown could be achieved by ordinary Christians, although the Imperial persecutions were now over. Both scenes also took place in Rome, and this local interest is part of the balance of Christian and traditional Roman gestures that the sarcophagus shows. The reeds behind Paul probably represent the boggy area of the city where Paul's execution was traditionally believed to have happened. Peter's execution was believed to have happened close to his grave, which was within a few feet of the location of the sarcophagus; both executions were believed to have occurred on the same day.

The Oppidan Press

The Oppidan Press is an independent student-run newspaper at Rhodes University in Grahamstown. 
History.
The newspaper was founded in 2007 by two undergraduates Lionel Faull (Editor 2007, Managing Editor 2008), and Ines Schumacher (Deputy Editor 2007, Editor 2008). It received almost no funding from the Rhodes University SRC at the time, and had to rely almost entirely on advertising revenue. 
The Oppidan Press was founded not only to provide news and entertainment to the previously disenfranchised Oppidan community, but also to increase the quality of student media at Rhodes University. The newspaper's direct competitor is Activate.
Purpose.
The Oppidan Press is primarily a newspaper produced for student readers who live off-campus in digs, although its orientation and coverage necessarily includes campus affairs, because all students are members of the Rhodes community. It is published fortnightly during university term-time, i.e. approximately 12 editions per year. However, this does not exclude special editions published for certain events which fall outside of these parameters.
Financing.
Although The Oppidan Press receives a grant from Rhodes University's Student Representative Council, all printing costs are covered by advertisements and private sponsors. The grant is used for the newspaper's extensive training programme, functions and office equipment. This makes the newspaper's editorial side completely independent of the University.

Atithi Devo Bhav

Atithi Devo Bhavah devo bhavaḥ (; English: 'The guest is God' or 'Guest become God') is a Sanskrit verse, taken from an ancient Hindu scripture which became part of the "code of conduct" for Hindu society. Atithi devo bhav regards a procedure of the Host-Guest relationship. Recently it has also become the tag line of India's Ministry of Tourism's campaign to improve the treatment of tourists in India; I Love India, Athidhi devo bhavan, Retrieved February 3, 2011.
Guest is God
The mantras are from the Taittiriya Upanishad, Shikshavalli I.20 that says: "matrudevo bhava, pitrudevo bhava, acharyadevo bhava, atithidevo bhava". It literally means "be one for whom the Mother is God, be one for whom the Father is God, be one for whom the Teacher is God, be one for whom the guest is God." "matrudevah, pitrudevah, acharyadevah, atithidevah" are one word each, and each one is a Bahuvrihi "samasta-pada". 
"Tithi" in Sanskrit denotes a (calendrical) date. In ancient times, when means of communication were limited and it was not possible for guests to anticipate their date of arrival, "atithi" (which literally means "without a fixed calendrical time") was coined to depict a visiting person who had no fixed date of arrival or departure. "Devah" (which, through sandhi or euphonic combination, becomes written/pronounced as "devo" when followed by certain kinds of consonants) means God and "bhava" means Be or Is - "be the one for whom the Guest is God".
Ritual or Puja.
In Hinduism Personal God is worshipped in a five-step worship; this is known as "Panchopchara Puja". The "Shodashopchar Poojan" is more elaborate and formal, and involves 16 steps.
The five steps from the worship become the five formalities to be observed while receiving guests:
Campaign by the Government of India.
India attracts millions of tourists each year, 3.3 million in 2003, but lags far behind other destinations. To attempt to improve the number of tourists travelling to India, the Tourism Department of India started the "Atithi devo bhavah" campaign with the theme Incredible India.
'Atithi Devo Bhavah' is a social awareness campaign that aimed at providing the inbound tourist a greater sense of being welcomed to the country. The campaign targets the general public, while focusing mainly on the stakeholders of the tourism industry. The campaign provides training and orientation to taxi driver, guides, immigration officers, police and other personnel who interact directly with the tourist.

LNER Pacifics

The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) operated various classes steam locomotives with a 4-6-2 (or pacific) wheel arrangement. The LNER operated more pacifics than any other of the Big Four British railway companies, and they were mostly used for express passenger work along the East Coast Main Line, though later in their lives many were displaced to other lines.
Overview.
In 1923, the LNER inherited four pacifics, to two classes each consisting of two locomotives, one class from either of two of its constituents, the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and the North Eastern Railway (NER). The Great Northern Pacifics, were of GNR Class A1, designed by Nigel Gresley and numbered 1470/1. The NER had completed two Pacifics, Nos 2400/1, designed by Vincent Raven. The LNER adopted the GNR classification system by wheel arrangement, with the A-prefix indicating the most prestigious wheel arrangement. The GNR Class A1s remained Class A1 and the NER pacifics were reclassified A2.
The LNER also classified pacific tank engines with A-numbers, and these were initially classified A5-7, and were eventually joined by a class A8. However, because of their different lineage and operational use, they are not further considered here.
The LNER completed an additional three A2s in 1924. In 1929 2404 "City of Ripon" was fitted with a modified A1 boiler, but otherwise the A2s bore little resemblance to the remaining LNER pacifics which were the continued evolution of the same basic Gresley design. The Raven Class A2s were all withdrawn from stock in 1936/7, freeing the A2 designation for later reuse.
Comparisons between the A1 and A2s revealed the A1s to be superior, so they were selected for more building. A total of 52 A1s were eventually built. From 1928, the A1s were started to be fitted with a higher pressure superheated boiler. This reboilering took them into Class A3, and eventually all but one of the 52 A1s would be rebuilt to Class A3, the process taking until 1948. In addition, a total of 23 new A3s (Nos 2743-51, 2595-9, 2500-8) were built.
In 1929 a single experimental Class W1 "Hush-Hush" locomotive was constructed. The W1 was rebuilt in 1936 to a more conventional 4-6-4, retaining its W1 classification. Although not technically not a Pacific, but a Hudson, there were many engineering similarities and operationally it shared similar duties.
The next class to be introduced was the Class A4 in 1935. A total of 35 were built. These were streamlined. One was destroyed during the war.
Post-war, the initially straightforward classification system for LNER pacifics started to break down. In 1945, Edward Thompson rebuilt the first A1 "Great Northern". This was initially kept classified A1 and the few remaining A1s were reclassified A10. The intention was always to rebuilt the remaining A10s into A1s, however this was not done as the rebuild was not successful and they were instead rebuilt to A3s; the Class A10 becoming extinct in 1948. Instead, a brand new class of 49 Peppercorn Class A1s were introduced in 1948/9, and in anticipation of these "Great Northern" was reclassified as Class A1/1 in 1947.
In 1943 and 1944 Thompson also rebuilt the Class P2s into Class A2/2s. In 1944, Thompson built another subclass when another subclass of A2s originally ordered as V2s, these being the LNER Thompson Class A2/1. Another fifteen new engines were built to a third design and classified A2/3.
Under the LNER's 1946 renumbering scheme, the Class A4s were given the lowest (i.e. most prestigious) numbers 1-34. The A3s and few remaining A10s were renumbered 35-112 and the Thompson A1/1 "Great Northern" became No. 113. The Thompson A2s were given 1946 numbers from rebuilding. The A2/1 becoming 507-10, A2/2 501-6, and the A2/3 becoming 500/11-24. A single Peppercorn Class A2, No. 525, was completed before nationalisation in 1948, but a further 6 were given LNER numbers (Nos 526-31) before BR decided on a numbering system. BR then added 60000 to all LNER pacific numbers, though it took a while to apply these. The remaining Peppercorn Class A2s received their BR numbers 60532-9 from new, as did the LNER Peppercorn Class A1s which were numbered 60114-62.
Withdrawal.
Excluding the Raven Class A2s, and one A4 which was destroyed by bombing during the war, British Railways withdrew the LNER Pacifics from stock between 1959 and 1966. The W1 (technically not a pacific by wheel arrangement but sharing many features) was withdrawn in 1959.
Preservation.
A total of eight original LNER pacifics have been preserved; six of these are A4s (of which two are in North America), one A3 and one Peppercorn A2.
"Tornado".
In addition to the preserved engines above, a new build Peppercorn Class A1, 60163 "Tornado" was completed in 2008. it is in its passenger BR blue livery

Elligood

Elligood was a ship of 327 tons and was constructed in New Brunswick in 1793. It may have been wrecked in 1801.
The ship was subsequently registered in London in 1795. Under the command of Master Christopher Dixson, the ship sailed from London in 1800 and arrived in Cape Town on 5 May 1800 and then later King George Sound in Western Australia on 27 August 1800. The ship returned to Cape Town in May 1801 under the command of Job Anthony as it had been reported that both Dixson and nine crew had died of scurvy.
The later history of the ship is unclear. There is some suggestion by J. S. Cumpston that the ship was wrecked on King Island and the wreck was found by William Campbell, the Master of the Brig "Harrington" on 18 March 1802. However, Charles Bateson states that he has found evidence that the ship was described in London in 1803. Its later history is unknown.

The Institut de rythmique Jaques-Dalcroze de Belgique exists from the beginning of the fifties. In 1975, the State of Belgium recognizes it as a National Institution of Musical Education. It is located in the old "Doctor Van Neck's hospital", first work of the famous Belgian architect Antoine Pompe (address: 53 Wafelaerts Street in Brussels). Since 1997, it is managing by Director Pierre Kolp .
Eyrhythmics as Music Education.
The Institut de rythmique Jaques-Dalcroze develops Swiss pedagogue Emile Jaques-Dalcroze's method. The Dalcroze Eurhythmics starts from the idea that the first instrument one has, is the body, since the birth. The learning of art expression must pass by the relations between the body, the space and the time. Dalcroze works on this relation thanks to the rhythm and elaborates, as a background, an education linked sensibility of perceptions ans understanding of happenings. By series of exercises, the method permits to link space and time in an artistic dimension. Since 1975, the Belgian Dalcroze Institute purposes multidisciplinar artistic formations that integrate creativity, interactivity and improvisation. The curricula are based on the sudy of music, dance and rhythms.
Bachelor and Master in Art Education Pedagogy.
The Institute Jaques-Dalcroze of Belgium, as well as the Institute Jaques-Dalcroze of Geneva, forms music education teachers that are able to use the Dalcroze method. The Institute Jaques-Dalcroze of Geneva also organises a Master.
Eurhythmics International Federation.
Nowadays, the Dalcroze Eurhythmics is taught all over the world. The teachers founded an International Association of Eurhythmics teachers (FIER - Fédération Internationale des Enseignants de Rythmique) benched in Geneva. This association publishes annually "Le Rythme/The Rhythm", a book presenting the results of researches.

Yūko Tanaka

Life and career.
Early career.
At the beginning of her career in 1979, Tanaka had a leading role in the NHK TV drama series and she also voiced the role of Judy in the Fuji Television anime movie , based on the novel by Jean Webster, which was broadcast in October 1979. Tanaka appeared in her first theatrical film in 1981, the historical drama "Eijanaika" and later that year she starred in "Edo Porn", a fictional biography of the artist Hokusai. Tanaka received a number of accolades for her work in these two films including Best Supporting Actress and one of the Best Newcomer of the Year awards from the Japan Academy. She also won the Blue Ribbon Award for Best Supporting Actress
as well as the Hochi Film Award for Best Supporting Actress. Tanaka returned to television drama in late 1981 with the Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) series about three office ladies (OL) reaching their 25th birthdays. The series, which also starred Masako Mori and Yūko Kotegawa, ran from September to December 1981.
In May 1982, Tanaka starred in the film directed by Yōichi Higashi, a role which earned her a nomination for Best Actress from the Japan Academy. Later that year, Tanaka played "Keiko", the love interest of Torajirō (Tora-san), in the comedy, "Tora-san, the Expert", part of a long running series of films. In early 1983, Tanaka played the part of a prostitute in the murder mystery with Tsunehiko Watase. Reviewer Kevin Thomas at the Los Angeles Times called Tanaka "So gorgeous and talented" that the film "becomes something extraordinary." For her part in the film she won both the Blue Ribbon Award and the Kinema Junpo award for Best Actress.
"Oshin" and afterwards.
As part of the celebration of their 30th anniversary in 1983, the Japanese TV network NHK inaugurated a new NHK Serial TV Novel titled . The serial told the story of a peasant girl, Oshin, born in 1900, who endures poverty and mistreatment but in later life finds success and happiness. Oshin as a young girl was played by Ayako Kobayashi but Tanaka took over the role as the adult Oshin. The series ran in almost 300 fifteen minute episodes broadcast from April 1983 to March 1984 and its peak rating (62.9%) made it "the most popular drama in Japanese TV history". The series was also popular outside of Japan and Tanaka became a "household name" in China in the 1980s.
After "Oshin", Tanaka returned to feature films with starring roles in the comedy "Capone Cries a Lot" which was distributed by Shochiku in February 1985, and in the August 1985 drama opposite Ken Takakura. Tanaka received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress from the Japan Academy for the two films.
Over the next ten years, Tanaka mostly worked in television, appearing in a dozen TV movies and in the lavish NHK historical series chronicling the period of the Meiji Restoration, , which ran in 48 episodes from January to December 1990. During this period, Tanaka also appeared in two films, one of them the July 1987 sentimental drama about a teacher, . Kevin Thomas at the Los Angeles Times called her "exquisite in her portrayal". In May 1988, Tanaka starred as Kino (Catherine in the novel) in "Wuthering Heights", director Yoshishige Yoshida's film adaptation of the classic Emily Brontë novel set in medieval Japan.
Tanaka met singer and actor Kenji Sawada when they were both in the 1982 film "Tora-san, the Expert" and they also appeared together in the 1985 movie "Capone Cries a Lot". Sawada at the time was married to singer Emi Īto but they separated in 1986 and were divorced in 1987. Tanaka and Sawada married in 1989.
Later career.
When director Yōji Yamada reworked a script from his popular "Otoko wa Tsurai yo" film series after the death of "Tora-san" star Kiyoshi Atsumi as in December 1996, Tanaka, who had earlier worked with Yamada in "Tora-san, the Expert", was chosen to play the true love of a manager of a failing movie theater (Toshiyuki Nishida). In July 1997, Tanaka provided the voice of Lady Eboshi in the anime fantasy "Princess Mononoke" and in the 1999 , Tanaka played one half of a manzai comedy duo whose failing marriage affects their daughter Wakana (Ikewaki Chizuru).
Tanaka continued performing in both film and television roles throughout the 2000s including starring with Ken Takakura in the 2001 Yasuo Furuhata drama, , about Japanese families after World War II. The film was nominated for 13 awards by the Japan Academy including a Best Actress nomination for Tanaka. In the January 2005 film , Tanaka took on the role of real life ceramic artist Kiyoko Koyama. When her son was diagnosed with leukemia, Kiyoko worked to form a patient's group for bone marrow transplants and she was instrumental in the formation of the Japan Marrow Donor Program (JMDP). The film was directed by Banmei Takahashi who is better known for his early work in "pink film". The movie brought Tanaka both the Hochi Film Award and the Kinema Junpo Award for Best Actress. Tanaka's next film role was a fifty-year old single woman who meets an old flame while delivering milk in the July 2005 roamntic drama . Tanaka won a Best Actress Award for her roles in this film and "Hibi" at the 2006 Japanese Professional Movie Awards. Tanaka voiced the character of the wizard Cob () in the July 2006 anime movie "Tales from Earthsea" which was also released in an English language version in the United States in August 2010.
Tanaka returned to television drama starring as the Empress Dowager Cixi in the NHK historical drama . The Sino-Japanese production ran in 28 episodes in Japan from January to July 2010 and in China from March 2010, with both versions receiving excellent ratings. She also reunited with previous co-star Ken Takakura in Yasuo Furuhata's film in August 2012. The next year she took the part of Keisuke Kinoshita's mother in the June 2013 "Dawn of a Filmmaker: The Keisuke Kinoshita Story", a drama based on the life of the famous Japanese film director, and she also played a leading role in Shinji Aoyama's in September 2013.

Rafflesia speciosa is a parasitic plant species of the genus "Rafflesia". It is endemic to the Philippine island of Panay. "R. speciosa" is the third "Rafflesia" species documented to exist in the Philippines, after "R. manillana" and "R. schadenbergiana". It belongs to the medium-sized "Rafflesia" (Meijer, 1997). The species was named by Julie Barcelona and Edwino Fernando.
"R. speciosa" was discovered in the mountains of Sibalom Natural Park (particularly Mount Porras) in Antique, Panay by members of an outdoor club. It was adopted as the symbol of Sibalom Natural Park and the municipality of Sibalom. For more information, see the review of Philippine "Rafflesia".

<doc id="20593361" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20593361" title="Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1">
Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1

The Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1 is the first widely used, new-generation, diesel railcar in Germany and Czech Republic for local railway services. Its most characteristic feature is the trapezium-shaped window frames. The Regio-Shuttle is classified by the Deutsche Bahn as Class 650, by the České Dráhy as Class 840 or Class 841, however numerous private railways have their own Regio-Shuttles.
Technical information.
Originally a product from the firm of ADtranz, the RS1 is now being built and sold by Stadler Rail AG, since Bombardier Transportation had to sell the site at Berlin-Wilhelmsruh in 2001 for legal reasons when they took over ADtranz. The RS1 is a standard gauge railbus built to UIC standards, which therefore can withstand longitudinal forces of 1500 kN; it is available with centre buffer couplings or the usual European coupling and buffer equipment. 65% of the vehicle floor is low-level and designed for a platform height of 55 cm. On the "Schönbuchbahn" a special variant designed for 76 cm platforms is in use. The railbus has a high-level floor over the two four-wheeled bogies at each end.
Two independent diesel-mechanical drive units, e.g. from MAN, run either on diesel fuel or Biodiesel from rape seed oil, each drive both axles on one of the two bogies.
The RS1's appearance is striking because its window design looks like a timber-framed bridge support (or Warren truss), the angled bodyshell pillars being visible at the windows. This construction was originally proposed to ABB (later ADtranz) by Design Triangle during a research study into weight reduction for high speed trains. The study, reported in a paper to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1996, showed that the diagonal pillar concept allowed mass reduction, improved passenger views and flexibility of seating layout, whilst maintaining adequate body strength and stiffness. ABB applied for a patent on the design. The Bombardier Itino uses a similar angled window pillar design. A similar window pillar design had been used on the Schienenzeppelin in 1929.
From an operational point of view the Regio-Shuttle may be used for one-man operations on full gauge railways without any restrictions. Its relatively small capacity (maximum under 170 passengers) is balanced by the fact that the vehicle can be driven in multiples of up to seven units. A rake of five RS1's can thus handle a maximum of just under 850 passengers, albeit somewhat uneconomical compared with a locomotive-hauled train due to the fuel consumption of its ten diesel motors.
In 2006 a Regio-Shuttle was converted by Voith. Amongst other things it was to have stricter exhaust emission and the top speed was to be raised to 140 km/h. A production series was to follow, however it looks as if the production of the Regio-Shuttle ceased in 2006. In 2007 and 2008 further orders followed from the ODEG, the HzL and Rhenus Veniro. Including the machines on order the total number of manufactureed Regio-Shuttles comes to 365 units. At the end of June 2008 the Deutsche Bahn AG agreed a contract with Stadler for the delivery of up to 60 Regio-Shuttles. These will be called off if DB Regio is successful in winning tenders and needs Regio-Shuttles for the services envisaged.
Current areas of operation.
Overview of railway companies.
The following railway companies have Regio-Shuttle RS1's in their fleet:
Employment by Deutsche Bahn.
In 1999 the Deutsche Bahn began to place "Class 650" railbuses into service and currently runs 74 units (as at: June 2005). They are numbered 650 001–027, 650 100–122, 650 201–203 and 650 301–321. 650 100–119 and 650 201–203 were funded by Baden-Württemberg. 650 001–027 and 650 100–122 are identical, 650 201–203 and 650 301–321 are cyclist shuttles, but otherwise constructionally identical with the Regio-Shuttles. The vehicles are operated from Tübingen and Ulm by DB subsidiaries DB ZugBus Regionalverkehr Alb-Bodensee (RAB). Since May 2000 all the vehicles have been in daily service.
Since 2007, numbers 650 322–327, funded by DB Regio Bayern, have also been in operation. In addition, the WestFrankenBahn has taken over a railbus from the "Kahlgrundbahn", number 650 997. This railbus has since been transferred to the SüdostBayernBahn and was deployed in 2008 on the "Traun-Alz-Bahn" between Traunstein and Traunreut.
Employment by České Dráhy.
In 2011 České Dráhy classified new type of regional train as "Class 840" (two magnetic track brakes for steep-grade service; gearing for 100 km/h) for routes in Liberecký kraj and little different "Class 841" (one magnetic track brake; maximum speed 120 km/h) for routes in Kraj Vysočina. From 2011 to 2012 was delivered 16 pieces of 840 ( 840 001-016 ) to Liberecký kraj. In 2011 was delivered 841 001 to Kraj Vysočina, next 16 pieces ( 841 002-017 ) will be delivered from 2012 to 2013.

<doc id="20593371" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20593371" title="California Avocado Commission">
California Avocado Commission

The California Avocado Commission is an agricultural marketing organization and trade association serving avocado producers in the American state of California.
Avocado production in California.
Avocados, native to Central and South America, have long been produced in California. California produces 90 percent of fresh avocados consumed in the United States (frozen and processed avocados are imported regularly from other countries). As of 2008, approximately 6,500 growers produce avocados on 60,000 bearing acres of land (less than 100 square miles). Price and production levels vary from season to season, and from year to year, due to weather and incidents such as fires. In a typical year production averages 350 million pounds at a wholesale price of $1 per pound, although 2008 was an exceptionally low yield year. Most avocados are grown from San Luis Obispo south, with San Diego County the largest producer.
Organization history.
The California Avocado Commission's predecessor organization, the California Avocado Advisory Board, was organized in 1961 out of dissatisfaction by individual growers with the success of the state's largest agricultural cooperative, Calavo Growers, Inc., to secure stable prices for avocados. New laws were passed allowing growers to form an association that would obtain a compulsory contribution from businesses directly involved in the avocado industry, and use the money to advertise and promote avocados to consumers throughout America. The Board assumed this marketing responsibility from Calavo, which continued to manage distribution and relations with retailers for the 60% of growers who remained in the co-op.
The newly organized Board began marketing avocados to American housewives and stay-at-home fathers, attempting to downplay the fruit's Mexican origin in favor of an exotic tropical or Mediterranean image, as well as its suitability for mass-produced processed food. The Board also attempted to counter the avocado's reputation as being unhealthy and fattening, a marketing effort that has continued sporadically through the present in an attempt to increase sales.
In the 1970s guacamole, once primarily consumed in America by Mexican-Americans, became popular throughout all of America, initially due to a Sunset Magazine cover story featuring avocado recipes. In the late 1970s to early 1980s consumption surged again due to Latino immigration. During the period Avocado consumption tripled in Mexico as well. 
The present Commission was organized in 1978 as a successor to the Advisory Board.
In the 1980s there was a boom in Avocado planting in California, mostly by small, semi-professional growers. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the Commission lobbied to prevent imports of fresh avocados from Mexico, which has a much larger avocado industry and lower labor, water, and land costs. One argument it used successfully until 1997, when importation was finally allowed, was that allowing Mexican avocados into the United States would spread crop disease. However, after 1997, lower costs of production in Mexico forced California growers to lower wages to become competitive.
Programs.
The organization is based in Irvine, California. Among its initiatives are advertising, public relations, defending growers from effects of importation of avocados from Mexico, compiling and disseminating industry news and information, lobbying, research on growing and production, and policing groves from "avocado rustlers" who steal fruit.
Revenues vary from $10–20 million per year (they vary with industry income).

Michael Hurley (footballer)

Michael Hurley (born 1 June 1990) is an Australian rules footballer for the Essendon Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).
Junior career.
A good junior cricketer and footballer, Hurley entered top-level football early, joining the TAC Cup competition for the Northern Knights. His accomplishments as a junior included selection as full-back in the All-Australian TAC Cup Team of the Year sides in 2007 and 2008. Despite concerns about his gall bladder—consequently removed in January—and a lack of pace. Hurley was selected with Essendon's first pick, and fifth overall, in the 2008 AFL Draft.
AFL career.
A key position utility, 1.93m (6 ft 4 in) tall and weighing , Hurley predominately played in the forward and backline in his AFL career to date.
Hurley made his AFL debut in 2009, winning the AFL Rising Star nomination in round 20, but played only nine regular season matches because of a quad strain and broken wrist.
In round 22, nine matches into his career, Hurley scored four goals, in a match-winning performance against Hawthorn. In the following week, former Brisbane Lions coach Leigh Matthews said, "Very few young talls have the physical maturity to match it with their older and stronger opponents, which is why the brilliant early form of young Bomber Michael Hurley is quite amazing."
On 25 September 2009 Hurley was arrested after a drunken altercation with a taxi driver, after the driver demanded payment for the fare when Hurley asked him to stop at a fast food drivethrough. Hurley was later charged with multiple counts of assault; it is alleged that he punched the driver and kicked him in the groin.
As of season 2010, Hurley has inherited the No.18 jumper left vacant by the retired Matthew Lloyd.
On the 22nd March 2012, Michael Hurley re-committed to the Essendon Football club until 2017 after agreeing to a new 5-year deal.

Europa Hut

The Europa Hut (German: "Europahütte") is a mountain hut located in the Mattertal above Randa in the Mischabel range at 2,265 m, owned by the Swiss Alpine Club. It lies on the Grächen-Zermatt high trail, called "Europaweg" (also part of the Monte Rosa Tour). From the hut a trail leads to the Dom Hut, on the normal route to the Dom.
The Europaweg is badly affected by unstable terrain; the entire path is prone to rockfalls and sections are sometimes closed. Do not be tempted to ignore the signs. The section between the Europahütte and Zermatt reopened on 4 July 2010 with the construction of a 230 metre suspension bridge over the Grabengufer, but this has since been closed due to the risk of falling rocks.[http://www.zermatt.ch/en/page.cfm/Aktuelles/News/europaweg_gerettet]. Diversions are in place which make the routes significantly longer.

Russ McKelvy

Russell Errett McKelvy (September 8, 1854 – October 19, 1915) was an American Major League Baseball player who played center field for the Indianapolis Blues of the National League (the only year the Blues were in the Major Leagues), and one game in right field for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys.
Career.
After attending Allegheny College from 1873 through 1877, McKelvy signed with the Indianapolis Blues of the National league for the 1878 season. He became the first player from Allegheny College to make it to the Major League level, as well the first to hit a home run. It came against Bobby Mitchell on June 1, 1878, in the top of the third inning, when he hit a two-run, inside-the-park home run. It was the only home run Mitchell surrendered during his four-year career. McKelvy played in a league leading 63 games that season, 62 of them in center field, which also led all National league center fielders in games played. His two home runs were third, and his 36 runs batted in were seventh amongst the league leaders. He pitched in a total of four games as a pitcher, one of which was a start, and the other three came in relief. 
1878 was the only year that the Blues were at the Major League level, and McKelvy did not reappear in the Majors until he made a one-game return, for the 1882 Pittsburgh Alleganys. In that game, played on August 24, 1882, he played right field, batted four times, and did not have a hit. This was his last appearance in the Majors.
Post-career.
McKelvy died at the age of 61 in Omaha, Nebraska, and is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Omaha.

Front of the Class (film)

Front of the Class is a 2008 American drama film based on the book by Brad Cohen, "Front of the Class: How Tourette Syndrome Made Me the Teacher I Never Had", co-authored by Lisa Wysocky.
The book was made into a Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie starring newcomer James Wolk—a 2007 University of Michigan graduate—and featuring Treat Williams and Emmy Award-winning actress Patricia Heaton as Cohen's parents; the movie aired on CBS on December 7, 2008.
Synopsis.
Brad Cohen's story starts as a young boy whose mother helped doctors to realize that he had Tourette syndrome. With his mother's help and the support of his school principal, Brad eventually becomes an award-winning teacher.
Thanks to his mother never giving up, Brad is a success story and shares his success with everyone around him.
Plot.
Twelve-year-old Brad lives in Missouri with his divorcée mother, Ellen, and younger brother, Jeff. He constantly gets into trouble with his father Norman and his teachers at school due to his tics. In one class, his teacher calls him to the front to make him apologize to his class for disrupting the class and promise he won't do it again. Determined to find out what is wrong with her son, Ellen seeks medical help. A psychiatrist believes that Brad's tics are the result of his parents' divorce. One lady suggests an exorcism. Ellen takes her search to the library and comes across Tourette syndrome (TS) in a medical book. She show this to the psychiatrist, who agrees with the diagnosis, and says that there is no cure. Brad and his mother attend a support group for the first and last time. From then on, Brad aspires to never be like the other members of the support group and to become successful. 
At the beginning of middle school, Brad is sent to the principal's office for being disruptive. The Principal invites him to the school concert later in the afternoon. At the end of the concert, he calls Brad up to the stage and asks Brad to talk about his TS. As Brad makes his way back to his seat, the school applauds him.
As an adult, Brad lives with his house mate Ron in Georgia, and is looking for work as an elementary school teacher. He is turned down after many interviews because of his TS. He finally gets an interview where the staff are accepting and they give him the job. 
On his first day, Brad explains his TS to the children. He helps Thomas with reading and makes an impression on Heather, a girl with terminal cancer. One student's father pulls her out of Brad's class as he fears Brad will distract her. 
Brad meets Nancy on an online dating site and invites her over for Thanksgiving back at Ellen's house, where he tells Nancy he loves her, and the feeling is reciprocated. He confides in Ellen his concern that Nancy will get fed up of his tics, but she reassures him that he mustn't let his TS get in the way.
An observer at the school assesses Brad's teaching, and the headteacher announces that Brad has been chosen to receive the Teacher of the Year award, which he accepts his award in front his family, friends and students. The ending titles tell that Brad got his Master's degree; he dressed up as Homer, the Atlanta Braves mascot; he married Nancy in 2006; and photographs of the real Brad Cohen teaching his class are shown.
Production.
The script was adapted from the book by Tom Rickman and the movie was directed by Peter Werner. Production was in Shreveport, Louisiana.
Following his 2006 appearance on "The Oprah Winfrey Show", in 2007 Cohen spoke at a conference after Timothy Shriver of the Special Olympics. According to Shriver, "The audience 'was laughing, then crying, then laughing, then crying, then cheering, and at the end, they gave him a huge standing ovation.'" Shriver suggested the movie to Cohen, and became the executive producer one year later.
To portray Cohen's tics accurately, Wolk and Kay viewed videotapes and worked with a dialect coach, describing their preparation as a "Tourette's boot camp". Cohen said the portrayal of his tics is "very, very authentic". Heaton, the mother of four children, was attracted to the script because she related to the strong mother: "Finally, she went to the library herself—as mothers will do to fight to the end for their kids and find out what's wrong—and realized he had Tourettes," Heaton explained.
Although tics steadily decline for most children as they pass through adolescence, Cohen still has frequent and loud vocal tics and barking. He joked: "I'm hoping I don't get kicked out of my own movie."
Release.
The movie was released on DVD in January 2009. A signed copy by author Brad Cohen was also released on DVD.
Reception.
Cohen was concerned that the movie should stay truthful and avoid sensationalizing Tourette syndrome. He was pleased with the overall result, although he noted some dates in his life were sped up for effect (for example, the date of his wedding).

Theodul Pass

Theodul Pass, elevation , (German: "Theodulpass", Italian: "Colle del Teodulo", French: "Col de Saint-Théodule", Walser German: "Théoduljoch") is a high mountain pass across the eastern Pennine Alps, connecting Zermatt in the Swiss canton of Valais and Breuil-Cervinia in the Italian region of Aosta Valley. Theodul Pass is the second lowest pass (after Furggjoch) and the easiest pass between the valleys of Zermatt and Valtournanche.
The pass lies between the Matterhorn on the west and the Breithorn on the east and is overlooked by the Theodulhorn and Testa Grigia. The "Rifugio del Teodulo" (hut) is located just above the pass. The east side of the pass is covered by large glaciers and is part of a year-round ski area.
Traverse by bicycle.
In 1965, Percy Stallard (aged 55) rode his bicycle solo over the Theodul Pass. The Rough Stuff Fellowship, an organisation for enthusiasts of cross-country cycling, acknowledged that it was probably the first time a cyclist had done it. Stallard made it in less than 15 hours, sometimes through deep snow.

Retail foreign exchange trading

Retail foreign exchange trading is a small segment of the larger foreign exchange market where individuals speculate on the exchange rate between different currencies. This segment has developed with the the advent of dedicated electronic trading platforms and the internet which have allowed individuals to access the global currency markets. In 2007 it had been speculated that volume from retail foreign exchange trading represents 5 percent of the whole foreign exchange market which amounts to $50–100 billion in daily trading turnover.
Prior to the development of forex trading platforms in late 1990s forex trading was restricted to large financial institutions. It was the development of the internet, trading software and forex brokers allowing trading on margin that started the growth of retail trading. Traders are able to trade spot currencies with market makers on margin. Meaning they need to put down only a small percentage of the trade size and can buy and sell currencies in seconds.
Fraud.
Retail forex trading has been promoted by some as an easy way to make profits and has thus been the focus for a number of foreign exchange frauds. In response financial regulators in a number of countries have introduced restrictions or provided warnings about this type of trading as well as legal actions against perpetrators. However due to the decentralized nature of currency trading and the easy global access to the internet, a number of brokers are based in less restrictive jurisdiction and investors should take caution when doing business with companies in less regulated countries. 
History.
1996 saw the first generation of forex online trading platforms based on the internet. These allowed both the foreign exchange and customer markets to flourish. The web-technology allowed retail foreign exchange trading to foster easy and fast ways for customers to access the markets and the currency pairs while making trades from their own computers.
The software development of trading platforms have seen a number of stages, initially trading platforms were based on basic programs downloaded to the computer. This was followed by the development easier to use interfaces and advanced features such as charting and technical analysis tools. The next stage saw the move to web based platforms and to mobile devices such as tablets and smart phones. There has also been a focus on developments to integrate automated trading tools and social trading into the forex trading platforms.

True vapor pressure

True vapor pressure (TVP) is a common measure of the volatility of petroleum distillate fuels. It is defined as the 
equilibrium partial pressure exerted by a volatile organic liquid as a function of temperature as determined by the test method ASTM D 2879.
The true vapor pressure (TVP) at 100 °F differs slightly from the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) (per definition also at 100 °F), as it excludes dissolved fixed gases such as air. Conversions between the two can be found here (p 7.1-54 and onwards)

Jizz in My Pants

"Jizz in My Pants" (known in the edited version as "J*** in My Pants") is a SNL Digital Short which aired on "Saturday Night Live" on December 6, 2008 and YouTube on the same day. It serves as the music video for the first single from The Lonely Island's debut album, "Incredibad". The video stars The Lonely Island members Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone and, briefly, Akiva Schaffer, and also features guest appearances by Justin Timberlake (who had also appeared in "Dick in a Box"), Molly Sims and Jamie-Lynn Sigler. "Jizz in My Pants" has been viewed over 128 million times on YouTube, , outviewing OK Go's popular treadmill music video, "Here It Goes Again", in less than six months.
The video's availability on YouTube is due to its publishing by The Lonely Island (and later Universal Republic in an edited version) instead of "Saturday Night Live". "SNL" had previously posted its own videos on YouTube, but removed its channel when Hulu.com was created.
Background and music video.
"Jizz in My Pants" was written by The Lonely Island during the summer of 2008. The comedy troupe rented a house in Los Angeles and created a makeshift studio where they would record songs. The music video was filmed in early September 2008, the week before the 34th season of "Saturday Night Live" premiered. The Lonely Island did not originally intend for it to actually be aired on the show, but the positive reactions by fellow cast and crew members persuaded them to change their minds.
The singing, done in English accents, is similar to the Pet Shop Boys and their song "West End Girls", with Samberg additionally comparing the beat to the works of producer Timbaland. The video opens with Samberg in a night club singing as he is about to hit on a girl (Molly Sims). They head to her apartment, but as they share a kiss in the hallway outside her door he ejaculates, or "jizzes", prematurely. He refuses to apologize, saying it would be "absurd" and blames the girl for overstimulating him by touching his buttocks. Taccone is then shown in a grocery store (where Justin Timberlake makes a cameo appearance as a janitor) conversing with a check-out girl (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), but jizzes in his pants as well when she asks, "Cash or credit?" He then decides to pay by check.
Samberg then exits a movie theater when the discovery of a missed cellphone call from the girl he met at the club causes him to prematurely ejaculate. In another scene, Taccone is seen driving a Mercedes-Benz while listening to the radio, when a song begins to play that reminds him of the check-out girl, causing him to "jizz" in his pants yet again. Samberg and Taccone then sing about how easily they "jizz in pants" from stimuli such as an alarm clock, opening a window, the twist ending of "The Sixth Sense", and simply eating a grape. They explain that merely being adjacent to women causes them to ejaculate, which, they lament, necessitates the constant wearing of condoms under their boxer shorts. Akiva Schaffer can be seen in the background at various times as the disc jockey.
Reception.
Critical.
A number of commentators enjoyed "Jizz in My Pants". Jennifer Maerz of "SF Weekly" felt the video was "funny in a totally moronic way," describing it as "pure electro-trash" with "douchebag clothes, attitudes, and beats". Mickey O'Connor of TV Guide liked the song's "clever lyrics" which "brilliantly satirize the pompous chill of '90s synth rock.'" "The New York Observer" writer Christopher Rosen described the video as "awesomely catchy", in contrast to the rest of the "SNL" episode, which he felt was not very good.
"Jizz in My Pants" reception was not all positive, however. Jerry Portwood of "New York Press" compared the video unfavorably to the work of "Weird Al" Yankovic. The video did not satisfy him "beyond a few chuckles." Portwood preferred Yankovic's ability to parody current events and pop culture, dissecting "what was actually manipulative and mind-numbing about popular music and the market as a whole". He wrote that Samberg, in contrast, sticks to "safe and, ultimately, ineffective parody."
Commercial.
The track sold 76,000 downloads in its first two weeks of availability. The song has gone Gold in Australia with sales in excess of 35,000.
The video was published first on YouTube along with most of Lonely Island's works. , "Jizz in My Pants" has been watched over 126 million times, making it the 38th most viewed video on YouTube and Lonely Island's second most popular video ever, coming after "I Just Had Sex ft. Akon".
It is also the 30th most liked video on YouTube as of May 2013.
