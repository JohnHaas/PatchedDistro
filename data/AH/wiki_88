National Counterproliferation Center

The National Counterproliferation Center (NCPC) is the primary organization within the United States Intelligence Community for combating the spread of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.
NCPC works with the Intelligence Community (IC) to identify critical intelligence gaps in counter-proliferation collection or analysis and then develops solutions to help close those gaps. NCPC also works to find and fund new technologies to help combat proliferation. Additionally, NCPC works to identify “over the horizon” proliferation concerns and creates strategies to ensure that the IC is well-positioned to address them.
History.
In 2004, then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist proposed a National Counterproliferation Center, noting that, "The greatest threat facing our country today is not solely a terrorist, but a terrorist armed with a weapon of mass destruction." 
He noted that a Center was needed "to focus, clarify and coordinate" U.S. efforts to stop the spread of chemical, biological and nuclear arms and missiles. Frist continued: "The bottom line is this: Just as we must take the offensive in the global war on terrorism, we must similarly take the offensive in stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We need a good offense, and counterproliferation is just the answer.
At its founding, then-Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte noted that, “… NCPC will enhance our country's ability to prevent terrorists or terrorist-related entities from acquiring" WMD.
Current Initiatives.
NCPC Funding of Counterproliferation Technologies
Shortly after its 2005 founding, NCPC established a fund to foster the development of innovative, counterproliferation technologies. It has been estimated that the fund “is in the low tens of millions.” 
According to a former Office of the Director of National Intelligence budget official, “fund will be seed money” that NCPC can focus toward worthwhile, cutting edge counterproliferation projects across the Intelligence Community.
Counterproliferation Reserve Corps
In a 2008 speech by Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence Donald Kerr, “Our National Counterproliferation Center is trying to lead the way in developing a plan to have a Counterproliferation Reserve Corps. It's really an adjunct to the Intelligence Reserve Corps that we already have, but we're really trying to bring these people back in a way that we can get another ten years or so out of their accumulated knowledge. It's going to be very important not just in the proliferation area. I think there are a number of others where we're going to have that same issue.” 
Advisory Committee on Bioterrorism
In 2006, it was announced that NCPC had formed a committee of medical experts to collaborate with the Intelligence Community on biological threats. According to NCPC Director Kenneth C. Brill, “While such a pandemic would be largely dealt with by those U.S. government agencies concerned with domestic and international public health issues, the Intelligence Community would be looked to for actionable medical intelligence about the spread of pandemic diseases that would not be available publicly…” 
NCPC received praise for this effort in the Report of the Commission on the Prevention of WMD Proliferation and Terrorism, which noted that, “NCPC also reaches out to elements inside and outside the U.S. government to identify new methods or technologies that can enhance the intelligence community’s capability to detect and defeat future proliferation threats.”

Meldemannstraße dormitory

The men's dormitory on Meldemannstraße 27 in Brigittenau district, Vienna, Austria was a public dormitory for men () from 1905 to 2003. It is a subject of public interest primarily because it was the residence of Adolf Hitler, the later dictator of Nazi Germany, from 1910 to 1913.
The dormitory in the 1900s.
The construction of the dormitory in 1905 was financed by a private charitable foundation which aimed at reducing the number of "Bettgeher" ("bed-goers") in Vienna. "Bettgeher" were poor people with no fixed abode, often shift workers from the countryside, who paid a small fee for the use of a bed in a private house for a few hours during the day. In 1910, they numbered 80,000 in Vienna, and were regarded as a threat to the morals of the host family.
The six-story dormitory was among the most modern facilities of its kind when it was opened in 1905. It was lit by gas lamps and light bulbs, and heated by a modern steam heater. On the ground floor, it featured a mess hall, a reading room with daily newspapers and a library. The underground floor held cleaning rooms, a luggage room, a bicycle storage room as well as a shoemaker's and a tailor's workshop. Moreover, the dormitory included a sick room with a resident physician, a disinfection chamber for the de-lousing of new residents, washrooms, a shaving room and a bathroom with sixteen showers and four bathtubs.
The actual dormitory was located on the upper four stories. Each of the up to 544 residents had a small cabin to his own, measuring by . The cabins, which were unlocked each evening at 8 p.m. and had to be vacated by 9 a.m., had a lockable door, a lightbulb, a bed, a small table, a clothes-hanger and a mirror.
The weekly rent was 2.50 crowns, about as much as a "Bettgeher" would have to pay for the use of a bed, which made it a very affordable lodging for unskilled labourers or journeyman artisans with an annual income of about 1,000 crowns. When the dormitory opened, the Viennese press praised it as "fantastical quarters, a paradise on earth" and as a "wonder of elegance and inexpensiveness".
Adolf Hitler's stay.
According to police registration files, Adolf Hitler – at the time unemployed and living off the sale of his paintings – lived in the dormitory for three years, 9 February 1910 to 24 May 1913. He had moved in from a homeless shelter in Meidling, where he had stayed since December 1909, and moved to Munich in 1913 after receiving his father's inheritance.
Hitler himself appears to have provided no details about his daily life in Vienna, but several of his co-residents later published their recollections of Hitler's stay in the dormitory. They report that he read the newspapers each morning in the non-smoking area of the reading room, where he also painted, discussed politics with other residents and gave speeches.
Among the men who wrote about Hitler's residence in the dormitory were Reinhold Hanisch, a vagabond and part-time labourer who died in prison in 1937 under unclear circumstances and whose recollections were published in "The New Republic" in 1939; one Karl Honisch who wrote a report for the Nazi party archives in 1938; Josef Greiner, a worker who published slim memoirs in 1938 and 1947; and an anonymous man who wrote reports that appeared in Czech newspapers in the 1930s.
Other co-residents of the dormitory with whom Hitler was involved included his Jewish friends Eduard Löffner and Josef Neumann, the Viennese druggist Rudolf Häusler who moved to Munich with Hitler in 1913, and a rival painter, Karl Leidenroth.
Later history.
In the 1990s, the Viennese city government decided to close the timeworn dormitory, which now served as a shelter for the homeless, in favour of a new shelter in Floridsdorf. Prior to its closure on 28 November 2003, the dormitory served in 2002 and 2003 as the venue of regular productions of George Tabori's play "Mein Kampf", whose subject is Hitler's stay in Vienna.
After its closure, the building was briefly occupied by squatters. In 2007, the former dormitory was converted to a retirement home with 200 rooms, named "Seniorenschlössl Brigittenau", which opened in January 2009.

Art.
Olinalá is located in the state of Guerrero. It is considered the most important center for the production of lacquer in Mexico and for this is known worldwide.
In Olinalá there are artisan workshops that have passed the techniques for lacquer production from generation to generation since pre-Hispanic times. The wide variety of products made using these techniques ranges from products of everyday use, such as chests, folding screens, trays, to the famous “cajitas de Olinalá”, small lacquered boxes. These crafts are part of a long and laborious process that involves approximately 29 steps.
There are different techniques involved in the decoration of these works: golden on the lacquered wood is made with a very fine paintbrush made of cat hair. The “rayado vaciado” with two layers of lacquer; the “rayado punteado” and traditional decorations with bright colors. Each work is let dry for various days before applying the last step: a varnish with linseed oil.
The motifs in the decorations also vary. Generally, they are nature themes, and can range from flowers, foliages and landscapes to animals, with a strong preference for the rabbit. The result is a perfectly finished work, of lively colors and entirely unique.

Xochistlahuaca

Xochistlahuaca is a town and municipality located in the southeast corner of the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is part of this state's Costa Chica region and while near the Pacific Ocean, most of the territory is mountainous. The population is dominated by the indigenous Amuzgo ethnicity, whose women are noted for their traditional hand woven garments, especially the huipil, which is made both for home use and for sale outside the area.
The town.
The center of population and of the Amuzgos in Guerrero is the town of Xochistlahuaca with a population of 4,152. It is located in rugged territory at an elevation of 390 meters above sea level.
The town is home to a communal Amuzgo radio station called Radio Ñomndaa (Word of water, referring to the Amuzgo language). It has become notable for its advocacy on Amuzgo issues locally and nationally.
The Museo Comunitario Amuzgo has two halls. One contains pre Hispanic pieces, other historical items such as those from the Mexican Revolution and other antiques. The other is dedicated to the Amuzgo handcrafts, especially textiles, and photographs related to the Amuzgo people.
The municipality.
As seat, the town of Xochistlahuaca is the local government of 103 communities which cover a territory of 430km2. It borders the municipalities of Tlacoachistlahuaca and Ometepec with the state of Oaxaca to the south and east. The seal of the municipality has a flower called a "laja nido" in the center, along with geometric designs which represent the weaving of Amuzgo women. The municipal government has one municipal president, a "síndico" and six representatives called "regidors."
The municipality has 103 communities. The largest communities after the seat are Guadalupe Victoria, Los Lirios, El Carmen and Arroyo Grande. Other important communities include Plan Maguey, Cabeza de Arroyo Nuevo, Llano del Carmen, Los Lirios, El Santiago, Plan de Pierna, Plan Lagarto, Guadalupe Victoria, Tierra Colorada, Arroyo Gente, Linda Vista, Arroyo Guacamaya, Arroyo Pájaro, Arroyo Montaña, Piedra Pesada, La Ciénega, Cumbre de San José, Rancho del Cura, Arroyo Grande, Junta de Arroyo Grande, Rancho del Cura Ejido, Cerro Bronco, Crucero de Camino, Ma-nantial Mojarra, Colonia Renacimiento, Plan de los Muertos, Cabeza de Arroyo Caballo and Colonia Luis Donaldo Colosio.
The highway connecting the municipality with Ometepec, the region's commercial center, was built in 1995. However, most transportation along this road is controlled by a single group of truckers and bus drivers because of the investment needed to by a vehicle. Others must work with this group to transport.
Demographics.
The population is young with just over fifty percent under the age of twenty. As of 2005, 91.7% of the population was indigenous with almost 86% of these being Amuzgo. The rest are almost all Mixtec . Xochistlahuaca is the largest of the Amuzgo communities which are located in this mountain area on both sides of the Guerrero/Oaxaca border although eighty percent are in Guerrero. Most of the Amuzgos in the municipality still speak the language, which is of the Oto-Manguean family. Some are monolingual, not speaking Spanish. The origin of the Amuzgo people is not known but as their language is related to Mixtec, it is possible they migrated along with these people from the north and separated out to this region to escape inter-ethnic violence. The Amuzgo name for Xochistlahuaca is Suljaá.There are some mestizos, which live primarily in the seat.
Culture.
Most of the municipality's cultural heritage is based on that of the Amuzgos, as the largest community of this ethnicity. Children from the municipality have been gathering indigenous oral stories for recording as part of the Concurso National de Narraciones Orales en Lenguas Indígenas (National Contest for Oral Narrations in Indigenous Languages). Juana Iriabth Moctezuma Tapia won the contest in 2004.
Most of the population is classified as Catholic although there is a small but growing percentage of Protestants. Protestantism was introduced to the region by the Instituto Lingüistico de Verano in the 1940s. Catholic beliefs are generally a syncretism with Amuzgo ones. On the feast day of Saint Mark, which comes at the beginning of the rainy season, chickens are sacrificed over a set of blue rocks which represent thunder and lightning. This is in petition for abundant rain and crops for the coming growing season. The end of the growing season and harvest are marked by the feast day of the Archangel Michael on September 29. Traditional medicine men and healing are still preferred by many as illness is generally conceived of as spiritual. Other important festivals include Carnival and the feast day of the Virgin of Guadalupe on December 12. In the community of Cozoyoapan, the feast day of Saint Sebastian on January 20 is important.
Most women and even men wear traditional clothing, made with either commercial or hand woven fabric. Industrial weaving has made hand weaving obsolete except for specialty garments or for those made for sale. the Amugo women of Xochistlahuaca are known for their hand woven fabric using the most traditional techniques and designs. Most of this fabric is sewn into "huipils", a traditional women's garment and other traditional items such as tablecloths, napkins and "rebozos". All pieces are original with no two exactly alike. Amuzgo women begin learning the weaving process when they are children with simple tasks such as cleaning and carding cotton. As they grow, they learn more difficult techniques and designs from the mothers and grandmothers using a traditional backstrap loom. Historically, weaving was to make clothing from the family, but it has become an important source of income for many Amuzgo families. A number of Xochistlahuaca weavers have won awards for their work such as the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes in 2004 and the weavers receive support from federal and other sources. Cooperation with government and university institutions has allowed the weavers to create new items and designs including pants, bathrobes, skirts and more. However, the "huipil" remains the most common and most sought-after item even though they tend to sell better to foreign buyers than Mexican ones as foreigners tend to appreciate the effort that goes into traditional weaving.
The traditional diet of the municipality is based on corn and other locally grown products. Chocolate is generally consumed as a beverage, especially during special events such as weddings. Tamales are a fundamental part of the diet and come in a variety of forms and fillings such as sweet corn, pork, chicken, freshwater shrimp and more. One local dish is called the "cabeza de viejo" or old man's head and there is a type of sweetened tortilla called a "ticaso".
History.
There is evidence that Xochislahuaca was the capital of an Amuzgo dominion, which was subject in part to the Mixtec province of Ayacastla when the Aztecs arrived in the 15th century. While Ayacastla was subjugated, the Amuzgos were never completely or directly under the control of the Aztecs. However, because of Aztec domination of the area, the name Xochistlahuaca comes from Nahuatl and means "plain of flowers." This is also the case for "Amuzgo" which means "where there are books," probably referring to the Xochistlahuaca's role as an administrative center. Much of the Amuzgo concentration in this region is due to the displacement of these people from the coast, first by Mixtec expansion, then by Spanish domination. Lastly, escaped slaves and their descendents came to dominate former Amuzgo lands, especially in what is now Cuajinicuilapa. The community of Cozoyoapan was founded by displaced Amuzgos in the colonial period from what is now San Nicolás in Cuajinicuilapa.
The area was conquered by Pedro de Alvarado in 1522. After the Spanish conquest, many indigenous in Guerrero died of disease and war, leaving the Amuzgos as one of only four ethnic groups to survive. In 1522, Xochistlahuaca had a population of about 20,000 but in 1582, this was down to 200 Amuzgos before recovering later in the colonial period. The Amuzgos were integrated into colonial rule via evangelization. In 1563, the town was named an administrative and religious center, similar to its role in the pre Hispanic era. During the 16th century, it was subject to Oaxaca city (then called Antequera) then it became part of the Puebla province. In the 17th century, it became part of the Chilapa diocese under Puebla and in 1884, it lost its status as a religious center.
During the Mexican War of Independence, Vicente Guerrero and his troops passed through the area in 1812, stopping at the Cerro Verde to reorganize and supply. In 1821, it became part of the Capitanía General del Sur, but then went back to Puebla in 1823 as part of the municipality of Ometepec. When the state of Guerrero was created in 1849, the town was made the seat of a municipality, which was then ratified in 1872. However, the seat was moved to Abasolo in 1873. In 1932, the town became a seat of a municipality again, this time separating from Ometepec. This was recertified in 1934.
From the colonial period through the 19th century, the Amuzgos lost control of their lands, paying rent to Spanish lords such as Guillermo Hacho. In 1920, the Amuzgos began to fight to regain control with the Xochistlahuaca ejido established in 1933 on 6,384 hectares. This ejido was recognized as the Xochistlahuaca municipality in 1934. In 1967, the ejido/municipality received 1,419 hectares more territory for a total of 7,803 hectares today.
In 1997, Hurricane Pauline, one of the worst cyclones to hit Mexico's Pacific coast, caused heavy rain leaving the municipally stranded by the loss of roads.
Since the latter 20th century, the political situation in Xochistlahuaca has been unstable. It is complicated by the fact that there are two authorities, traditional indigenous councils, mostly Amuzgo and the constitutional municipal government, dominated by mestizos. The Amuzgo council usually consists of elders selected for their participation in the community, especially the sponsorship of religious festivals as well as family ties. The municipal authorities are dominated by mestizos because of their command of Spanish and greater ties to the overall Mexican culture. This has caused tension between the two groups which has been complicated by converts to Protestantism who reject the traditional councils and independent political movements, especially since the 1980s. In the early 2000s, the political situation was particularly volatile with the municipal president Aceadeth Rocha refusing to recognize certain traditional authorities. In 2001, a group of Amuzgos took over the municipal palace to protest. This action spurred the creation of the Frente Cívico Indígena de Xochistlahuaca and the Frente Comunitario de Xochistlahuca, which have had influence in both political and social issues. Sentiments among the Amuzgos have run particularly against the PRI political party, which dominated municipal politics for decades and mostly in favor now towards National Action Party (PAN). Since 2006, both traditional and municipal authorities have recognition but the situation remains uneasy. 
On March 20, 2012, a 7.4 earthquake was centered very near the municipality affecting it and most of the rest of the Costa Chica region. It was the strongest in Mexico since the 1985 earthquake. Over fifteen communities in the municipality suffered moderate damage including large cracks and separated walls in a number of community churches and landslides covering roads.
Geography and environment.
The town and municipality is located southeast of the Guerrero capital of Chilpancingo. It is part of the Costa Chica region of the state which extends from Acapulco to the Oaxaca border. The municipality straddles the Sierra Madre del Sur and the flatter areas that reach down towards the Pacific Ocean. About 65% of the terrain of the municipality is mountainous and rugged, mostly in the north with small mountain ranges known as Pajaritos and Malinaltepec, which reach about 2,000 meters above sea level. The two most important elevations are the Cerro Verde and the Cerro de Agua. About 25% is flat and semi-flat with the rest being small valleys and riverbanks.
The main river is the Santa Catarina which separates the municipality from the state of Oaxaca. Other important rivers include the Puente and the San Pedro or Xochistlahuaca River. These rivers with year-round flow provide potable water for most of the area's population in towns such as Tres Arroyos, La Montaña, El Pájaro, El Chacale, La Guacamaya, El Lagarto and Arroyo Caballo. Other rivers include Atotonilco Verde, Mujer, Totole, Fierro, Pájaro and Lagarto. There are also many streams which flow year round as well.
The climate is semi moist with temperature ranges between hot, semi hot and temperate depending on altitude. Tlacoachistlahuca border are the coolest. The average annual temperature is 25C. Average annual rainfall is between 1000 and 2000 mm per year with a defined rainy (May to October) and dry (November to April) season which are agriculturally and culturally important.
Most of the territory is used for either agriculture or livestock. There are some areas with forest. There are two main types of wild vegetation in the municipality. The first runs along the north side of the Sierra Made del Sur where there are mixed forests with various species of trees including oak and mahogany. On the south side, there is low-growth rainforest (under fifteen meters of height) with much of the area's fruit growing takes place. Many of the trees lose their at least some of their leaves during the dry season. Much of the area's habitat has been degraded but there is still some wildlife such as raccoons, badgers, foxes, wild boar, deer, wildcats, and a number of reptile and bird species.
Socioeconomics.
The municipality, including its seat, has a very high level of socioeconomic marginalization. It is the fourth poorest in the state of Guerrero and the sixteenth poorest in Mexico. As of 2010, there were 6,019 residences in the municipality. Most of these are constructed with adobe and thatch instead of more modern cinderblock and brick, especially outside the municipal seat. Most are one or two rooms, and some are simple structures meant to be occupied during the growing season. Most homes in the municipality lack one or more services such as running water, electricity and drainage. Almost 30% with dirt floors. 
Almost 33% earn less than minimum daily wage. Migration out of the municipality is low but it is growing. Most are men who go to Acapulco, Chilpancingo, other states in Mexico and some to the United States. This migration is both seasonal and permanent. Women who migrate usually stay in Mexico and work as domestics.
There is an illiteracy rate of almost 30%. About 54% do not complete basic education.
One improvement is that access to health services rose from less than fifteen percent in 2005 to over 73% in 2010. 
The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, livestock, handcrafts especially textiles and ceramics and some commerce. Newer products include the making of cheese and piloncillo. Most of the products which are sold outside of the municipality go to the mestizo markets in Ometepec. These include cash crops such as oranges, mamey, sugar cane, jicama and piloncillo, along with handcrafted items such as textiles and fireworks. Economic activity is generally assigned by gender with men doing the farming and livestock raising and women doing domestic chores and weaving.
The main economic activity in Xochistlahuaca is agriculture. Agriculture is mostly of the slash-and-burn variety with most land held communally. The most important crops are corn, beans, sesame seed and hibiscus followed by squash, chili peppers, tomatoes, cotton and cacao . Important cash crops include mangos, sapotes, tamarind, hibiscus, amaranth, spearmint, tomatoes and potatoes. Most is grown on the south side of the municipality.
There has been a growing industry of cattle raising and dairy products, such as cheese for sale to surrounding municipalities, especially Ometepec. The forest as a number of tropical hardwood species which are used to make furniture with an annual harvest of about 2500m2 per year.
About 45% of the population is dedicated to industry, mostly women who weave. Weaving and other handcrafts play an important economic role as in many cases, farming is not enough to meet subsistence needs.
Most of the commerce is in the municipal seat and includes shops selling sewing supplies, groceries, farming supplies and food stands. There is some tourism by people who come to see the textiles.

Moro Cojo Estuary State Marine Reserve (SMR) is a marine protected area established to protect the wildlife and habitats in Moro Cojo Slough. Moro Cojo Slough is located inland from Monterey Bay on the central coast of California, directly south of the more widely known Elkhorn Slough. The area covers . The SMR protects all marine life within its boundaries. Fishing and take of all living marine resources is prohibited. 
History.
The Moro Cojo SMR was established in September 2007 by the California Fish and Game Commission. It was one of 29 marine protected areas adopted during the first phase of the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative. The Marine Life Protection Act Initiative (or MLPAI) is a collaborative public process to create a statewide network of marine protected areas along the California coastline. 
Within Moro Cojo SMR all living marine resources are protected.
Geography and natural features.
Moro Cojo SMR is near the Moss Landing State Wildlife Area, the Elkhorn Slough State Marine Reserve and the Elkhorn Slough State Marine Conservation Area.
Moro Cojo SMR includes the waters within Moro Cojo Slough below mean high tide and east of the Highway 1 Bridge and west of the crossing of the Southern Pacific railroad tracks.
Habitat and wildlife.
Moro Cojo Slough provides representation of rare brackish habitats that support threatened species. Habitat types include mudflats, tidal creeks and channels.
Moro Cojo and nearby Elkhorn sloughs host year-round residents tightly associated with estuaries, such as pickleweed, eelgrass, oysters, gaper clams, and longjaw mudsuckers, as well as important seasonal visitors such as migratory shorebirds, sea otters, and sharks and rays.
Recreation and nearby attractions.
The nearby Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve and Elkhorn Slough Foundation provide on-site management, education, and stewardship and offer public access via of trails, as well as a Visitor Center and volunteer opportunities.
Also nearby is the Moss Landing Wildlife Area which protects of salt ponds and salt marsh. Limited recreation is permitted within the Wildlife Area.
California’s marine protected areas encourage recreational and educational uses of the ocean. Activities such as kayaking, diving, snorkeling, and swimming are allowed unless otherwise restricted. 
Scientific monitoring.
As specified by the Marine Life Protection Act, select marine protected areas along California’s central coast are being monitored by scientists to track their effectiveness and learn more about ocean health. Similar studies in marine protected areas located off of the Santa Barbara Channel Islands have already detected gradual improvements in fish size and number.

1993 Stanley Cup playoffs

The 1993 Stanley Cup playoffs, the championship of the National Hockey League (NHL), began at the conclusion of the 1992–93 NHL season on April 18, and ended with the Stanley Cup win on June 9. 
The Presidents' Trophy-winning Pittsburgh Penguins, who had won the Stanley Cup the previous two years, were the favourite to "three-peat" (Just like the NBA's Chicago Bulls). However, both conferences saw numerous upsets (The 3rd place team in every division reached their respective conference finals), and the championship went instead to the Montreal Canadiens, who won in a five-game series with the Los Angeles Kings. The Canadiens had 11 consecutive wins in total (tying the record), and they also set an NHL playoff record by winning 10 overtime games.
This was the first time since the 1979 NHL-WHA merger that the Edmonton Oilers had missed the playoffs. It was also the first time that longtime Oiler and then-New York Rangers captain Mark Messier had missed the playoffs in his career.
This was the only year between 1984 and 1994 that the Bruins and Canadiens did not face each other in the playoffs.
Division semi-finals.
Adams Division.
Boston vs. Buffalo.
Although Boston had entered the playoffs with the second best record in the entire NHL and the Sabres had the second lowest point total of any playoff team, Buffalo upset the Bruins by sweeping the heavily favored Boston squad. The fourth game saw Brad May's game-winning goal in overtime, which has become famous in NHL lore thanks to Rick Jeanneret's "May day!" call. 
"Buffalo wins best-of-seven series 4–0"
Quebec vs. Montreal.
The Canadiens lost the first two games of this series against the rival Nordiques, due in part to a couple of weak goals let in by star Montreal goaltender (and Quebec City native) Patrick Roy. Afterward, a newspaper in Roy's hometown district suggested that he be traded, while Nordiques goaltending coach Dan Bouchard also proclaimed that his team had solved Roy. However, Montreal coach Jacques Demers held himself to a promise he had made to Roy earlier in the season and kept him as the starting goalie.
With the Habs staring a potential 3–0 series deficit to the Nords in the face, overtime in Game 3 was marked by two disputed goals that were reviewed by the video goal judge. The first review ruled that Stephan Lebeau had knocked the puck in with a high stick, but the second upheld the Habs' winning goal, as it was directed in by the skate of Quebec defenceman Alexei Gusarov and not that of a Montreal player. 
As it turned out, this was the final playoff series between the provincial rivals before the Nordiques moved to Denver in 1995 and became the Colorado Avalanche.
"Montreal wins best-of-seven series 4–2"
Patrick Division.
Pittsburgh vs. New Jersey.
The two-time defending Stanley Cup champions were a heavy favorite to be the first team since the 1980-83 New York Islanders to win more than two consecutive Cups. Entering the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winner, the Penguins faced off against the #4 qualifier from their division, the New Jersey Devils, who were making their fourth straight appearance in the playoffs after several years of struggling. By winning the first three games of the series, Pittsburgh extended its playoff winning streak to fourteen games, dating back to game 4 of their 1992 Patrick Division Final against the New York Rangers, and set an overall playoff record for longest winning streak. The streak ended in Game 4 when the Devils were able to stave off elimination, but the Penguins quickly closed out the Devils in the next game to advance.
"Pittsburgh wins best-of-seven series 4–1"
Washington vs. New York Islanders.
The Islanders were returning to the playoffs after missing them the past two seasons while the Capitals were looking to win their first series in the last two years. Instead, the Islanders won in a six-game series for their first playoff series win since defeating Washington in a seven-game affair in 1987.
Game 6 of this series was marred by a vicious hit by the Capitals' Dale Hunter on the Islanders' leading scorer, Pierre Turgeon, moments after Turgeon scored a third-period goal to put the game and the series out of reach for Washington. Turgeon suffered a separated shoulder on the play and missed almost all of the next round. Hunter received a 21-game suspension for his actions, the longest in NHL history up to that time, which was served during the 1993–94 season.
"NYI win best-of-seven series 4–2"
Norris Division.
Chicago vs. St. Louis.
The Blackhawks, on an overtime goal in Game 4, became the second division champion after the Bruins to be swept in the first round of the playoffs. Chicago goaltender Ed Belfour complained that St. Louis star Brett Hull had interfered with him on the play, but to no avail as the tally stood as the game- and series-winner. Belfour famously went on a rampage after the game, breaking a hot tub, coffee maker, and television in the visitors' locker room at the St. Louis Arena. In 1999, Hawk fans would be left to contemplate the irony of the situation when Belfour and Hull were teammates on the Cup-winning Dallas Stars, who in 1993 were known as the Minnesota North Stars. With the sweep at the hands of the Blues, Chicago saw their playoff losing streak extended to eight games, dating back to the Stanley Cup Finals of the previous year against the Penguins.
"St. Louis wins best-of-seven series 4–0"
Detroit vs. Toronto.
In a revival of the heated Original Six rivalry, Nikolai Borschevsky's Game 7 overtime goal gave Toronto the series and made them the sixth club to eliminate a team with a better regular season record in the first round of the playoffs. This was also Toronto's first playoff series win over Detroit since the Leafs beat the Wings in the seven-game 1964 Stanley Cup Finals.
"Toronto wins best-of-seven series 4–3"
Smythe Division.
Vancouver vs. Winnipeg.
The Smythe Division champions from Vancouver managed to shut down the Jets in six games and eliminate them for a second year in a row. Game 6, however, was not without controversy. Greg Adams would score the first goal for the Canucks, however, video replay showed the goal was clearly scored with a high-stick, but still counted. Adams would go on to score the game winner in overtime, once again, the goal was surrounded with controversy as video replay showed Adams crashing into the net and goalie Bob Essensa, then sending the puck into the net with the back of his skate. The goal also counted and Jet fans in attendance began to throw debris onto the ice in frustration with the call. 
"Vancouver wins best-of-seven series 4–2"
Calgary vs. Los Angeles.
The Kings upset the Flames in a high-scoring six-game series. The winning team scored 9 goals in 3 of the 6 games. However, the series turned in the lowest scoring game. Trailing 2 games to 1 and having lost 2 straight, Kings coach Barry Melrose inserted backup goalie Robb Stauber for the struggling Kelly Hrudey, who had allowed 17 goals in 3 games. Stauber played brilliantly in the Kings 3-1 win; instead of going back to Calgary down 3 games to 1, it was a brand new series, tied at 2 wins apiece. Stauber remained the Kings' starting goalie until game 2 of the next series against Vancouver, when Hrudey took his job back for the remainder of the playoffs. However, it was the Kings offense that was largely responsible for winning the series, scoring 9 goals in games 5 and 6.
"Los Angeles wins best-of-seven series 4–2"
Division finals.
Adams Division Final: Montreal vs. Buffalo.
The long-awaited series between two of the NHL's top goaltenders, Montreal's Patrick Roy and Buffalo's Grant Fuhr, had finally arrived. However, the Canadiens swept the series, winning every game by a score of 4–3 and claiming the Adams Division championship. A pivotal moment came in the 2nd period of game 3 when Sabres star Alexander Mogilny suffered a badly broken leg, ending what had been a tremendous campaign of 76 goals in 77 regular season games followed by 7 goals in 7 playoff games. As in their previous series, the Habs played three overtime games, this time winning all three.
"Montreal wins best-of-seven series 4–0"
Patrick Division Final: Pittsburgh vs. New York Islanders.
The Islanders upset the two-time defending Stanley Cup Champions to win the last Patrick Division playoff championship. David Volek's overtime goal in Game 7 was the deciding tally, as New York rallied from a 3-2 deficit to defeat the Penguins. Islanders defenceman Darius Kasparaitis played a large role in his team's win, neutralizing Pittsburgh stars Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr with big hits. With their upset of the Pens, the Isles reached the Wales Conference Finals for the first time since 1984, which saw the Islanders make their fifth consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Finals. 
"New York Islanders win best-of-seven series 4–3"
Norris Division Final: Toronto vs. St. Louis.
The Maple Leafs defeated the Blues in seven games to win the Norris Division playoffs, despite Blues' goaltender Curtis Joseph's best efforts. St. Louis was heavily outshot throughout the series, including more than 60 shots in Game 1 alone. Game 7 of the series was the first to be played at Maple Leaf Gardens since Game 7 of the 1964 Stanley Cup Finals, when Andy Bathgate scored the Cup-clinching goal for the Leafs over the Red Wings.
"Toronto wins best-of-seven series 4–3"
Smythe Division Final: Vancouver vs. Los Angeles.
The Vancouver Canucks, who easily won the regular season Smythe Division title, were strong favourites over the Kings. Especially winning all home games against the Kings. Their 5-2 win in game 1 did nothing to change that. Kings coach Barry Melrose re-inserted Kelly Hrudey as the Kings starting goalie in game 2 and he responded with a strong effort as the Kings evened the series with a 6-3 win. After the teams split the two games in Los Angeles, they headed back to Vancouver for the crucial game 5. Kings fourth line forward Gary Shuchuk scored on a rebound during a goal mouth scramble late in the second overtime, and the Kings skated off the ice in front of a stunned Vancouver home crowd with a 3-2 series lead. Back in Los Angeles for game 6, the Canucks could not recover; the Kings jumped out to a 5-1 lead in game 6 and won the series despite two late Canuck goals. Thus the Kings advanced to the Campbell Conference finals as the winners of the Smythe Division playoffs.
It was the only one of the twelve Smythe Division Finals contested from 1982 through 1993 to be won by the LA Kings (The only American team in this division).
"Los Angeles wins best-of-seven series 4–2"
Conference finals.
All teams in the Conference finals were seeded third in their division.
Wales Conference Final: Montreal vs. New York Islanders.
The Canadiens came into the series well rested after having a week off following their four game sweep of the Sabres, while the Islanders came in very weary after eliminating the Penguins two days earlier. Montreal's win in game three was their eleventh straight, tying the single-playoff record set a year earlier by Pittsburgh and Chicago. They also added two more overtime victories, bringing their total to seven straight for the playoffs (they lost their first OT game in this year's playoffs), and won the final Wales Conference championship.
Campbell Conference Final: Toronto vs. Los Angeles.
This was the first conference final since 1982 not to have "either" the Calgary Flames or the Edmonton Oilers representing the Smythe Division, and the only one between 1982 and 1994 not to feature a team from Western Canada. The Toronto Maple Leafs iced a competitive team for the first time in many years and were hoping to reach the Stanley Cup finals for the first time since their championship in . The Los Angeles Kings, led by captain Wayne Gretzky, also had high ambitions. Gretzky had never played a postseason game in Toronto prior to the series. During Game 1, Los Angeles blue-liner Marty McSorley delivered a serious open-ice hit on Toronto's Doug Gilmour. Leafs captain Wendel Clark took exception to the hit and went after McSorley for striking their star player, and Toronto coach Pat Burns tried scaling the bench to get at Los Angeles coach Barry Melrose because he thought Melrose ordered the hit on Gilmour (McSorley later remarked in interviews that he received dozens of messages threatening death on his hotel phone from angry fans). 
Toronto took a 3–2 series lead heading into the controversial Game 6 in Los Angeles. With the game tied at 4-4 in overtime, Gretzky high-sticked Gilmour in the face, cutting his chin open. Many thought that referee Kerry Fraser should have called a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct on the play (generally given for high sticking penalties that result in a cut at that time; linesmen can also call penalties for stick infractions, or at least advise the referee that an infraction occurred). However, Gretzky was not penalized and went on to score the winning goal moments later, evening the series at 3–3. In Game 7 at Toronto, Gretzky scored a hat trick (three goals) and added an assist to give the Kings another 5-4 win and the first Stanley Cup Finals berth in team history. Gretzky later called Game 7 of the 1993 Campbell Conference Finals the greatest game he had ever played.
Final.
This was Montreal's first trip to the Final since 1989. It was Los Angeles' first appearance ever in the Final, and Wayne Gretzky's first and only appearance in the Final with the Kings. Montreal would capture their 24th and most recent Stanley Cup championship.

Meadeau View Institute

The Meadeau View Institute was a conservative constitutionalist organization that operated in Duck Creek, Utah, from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. The institute was notable for seeking to build a Utopian community of alternative-lifestyle conservatives in Southern Utah. The community collapsed in 1994 due to financial problems incident to the loss of property in an accidental explosion.
Founding.
William H. Doughty, the institute's founder and money manager, accepted over $1 million in donations and loans from backers in an attempt to build a conservative Utopia in Duck Creek and Mammoth Valley, Utah (near Hatch). In December 1986, Doughty purchased a vacant lodge in Duck Creek from Harry and Gabrielle Moyer, who carried the note for him. He later moved his Institute for Constitutional Education (ICE) from Cedar City to the lodge. Contributors include Cleon Skousen, Glenn Kimber, and Donald N. Sills.
Collapse.
During the winter of 1993, snow build-up from a record snowfall led to a propane explosion at the Meadeau View lodge. The investment which had been made in this asset was lost, as well as the income from seminars and conferences. As a result, donations and other fundraising efforts also failed, leading to the demise of the organization. The fledgeling George Wythe College, which had been holding classes in the lodge, moved to Cedar City, and those who sought to build the community, including Shanon Brooks (who later became president of George Wythe University), left.
As of 2004, Doughty still maintained a ranch in Mammoth Valley.
Aftermath.
The "Deseret News" reported that participants who lost money were reluctant to come forward to authorities, due to their inherent distrust for the government.

Club career.
Youth career.
Leerdam started his career at local Utrecht club USV Elinkwijk. Feyenoord followed the midfielder for many years and eventually joined the Feyenoord youth academy in the season 2005–06.
Coming from an amateur side, Leerdam had a difficult start in the Feyenoord youth. The first two seasons he was mainly used as a substitute. Leerdam joined a successful generation in Feyenoord U17, where he had to compete with players like Leroy Fer, Georginio Wijnaldum and Kevin Wattamaleo for a place on the midfield. After two years, when other players took their chance on a higher level, Leerdam became a regular starter in the U19 team. Thanks to his hard work and dedication, Leerdam eventually made it to Feyenoord's first team squad as well. In January 2007, Leerdam was invited to the first team's training camp in Belek, Turkey, by Feyenoord manager Erwin Koeman. On 6 June 2008, Leerdam signed his first professional contract until 2011.

Kevin Barnes (American football)

Kevin Barnes (born September 15, 1986) is an American football cornerback who is currently a free agent. He played college football at the University of Maryland. He was drafted by the Washington Redskins in the third round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He has also played for the Detroit Lions.
Early years.
Barnes was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on September 15, 1986, and raised in Dunn, North Carolina, but later moved to Glen Burnie, Maryland. Where he was raised by parents Kenneth and Debra Hilliard. He attended Old Mill High School, where he played football as a cornerback and wide receiver. Barnes also played basketball and competed in track and field.
As a junior in 2002, he recorded ten receptions for 222 yards and four touchdowns. That year, he was named an Associated Press Big School second-team all-state, "Baltimore Sun" honorable mention All-Met, and all-county player. As a senior in 2003, Barnes recorded 62 tackles, including 32 solo, three interceptions, and three broken-up passes. That year, he was named an Associated Press Big School all-state, "Baltimore Sun" All-Met, and "Washington Post" honorable mention All-Met.
Barnes was named a SuperPrep Mid-Atlantic all-region and PrepStar all-region player. He was not highly recruited, however, and was rated a two-star prospect by Scout.com. Duke and Virginia recruited him before he committed early to Maryland.
College career.
Barnes redshirted in 2004 and was named the defensive scout team player of the week prior to the NC State and Virginia Tech games. In 2005, he saw action in ten games, mostly on special teams. He recorded four solo tackles and a pass broken up. In 2006, Barnes played in all 13 games including one start, the first of his career, against . That season, he compiled 11 tackles, which included nine solo.
In 2007, he was the first on the team in interceptions with four, second in passes broken up with nine, and fifth in tackles with 65, including 47 solo. He recorded the most interceptions by a Maryland player since Domonique Foxworth in 2002. After the 2007 season, the Terrapins lost three starters in the secondary to graduation, and Barnes stepped in to assume a leadership role during his senior year.
As a fifth-year senior in 2008, Barnes played in the first seven games before suffering a shoulder injury. He recorded two interceptions returned for 27 yards, 20 tackles including 15 solo, five passes broken up, seven passes defended, two forced fumbles, and one blocked kick.
In the third game of the season, against California, Barnes gained notoriety for the delivery of a hard hit against running back Jahvid Best, an early Heisman Trophy prospect. Late in the second quarter, Cal quarterback Kevin Riley recognized Maryland was in man-to-man coverage. Since he saw there were no safeties in the middle of the field, he threw a short screen pass to Best. Barnes, who had anticipated the play from the snap, immediately delivered a bone-jarring tackle that almost knocked off Best's helmet. While still lying on the field, Best rolled onto his side to vomit. Footage of the hit and its aftermath circulated widely on the internet and became a viral video phenomenon that received 50,000 views on YouTube within a week. After the game, Best said, "That's probably the hardest hit I've ever taken in my life... It really knocked the wind out of me, and I had a little trouble breathing for the rest of the game." When asked if he felt bad about the tackle, Barnes said, "He's not permanently hurt, so I'm fine with that. Had he died or something, I'd have felt bad, but he'll probably be playing next week."
In the seventh game of the season, he used his left shoulder to hit Wake Forest wide receiver D. J. Boldin, who was attempting to catch a pass. Barnes suffered a torn glenoid labrum, fractured left scapula, damaged rotator cuff, and broken clavicle. The injury ended his season, and he missed the final six games of his senior year. Barnes later remarked, "It was my last hit ... Even though I got hurt, it caused a guy to fumble. I've got to look at it that way. I still have smile on my face." Despite being unable to play, Barnes remained actively involved with the Terrapins for the rest of the season and took on the role of a student coach. Secondary coach Kevin Lempa said:"He's another coach out there right now... He's been such an important player for our defense for a long time, and he still wants to help as much as he can. All throughout the game in the pouring rain against NC State, he was talking to the guys on the sideline, so he's like another coach... We all miss having him on the field, but we're glad he's still with us in some capacity."
Barnes received an unusually early invitation to the 2009 Senior Bowl, on September 18, just five days after the game against California in which he tackled Best. He attended, but due to his shoulder injury, could not participate in the game.
Professional career.
Washington Redskins.
2009 season.
In the 2009 NFL Draft, Barnes was selected by the Washington Redskins in the third round as the 80th overall pick. He had participated in the 2009 NFL Combine, where he impressed scouts by scoring highly among cornerbacks in the speed and agility tests. Barnes also scored the highest grade at the combine on the Wonderlic intelligence test with a 41 out of 50, which far exceeded the average prospect's grade of 19. He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.52 seconds, which was 0.06 seconds slower than the fastest time record by a cornerback. His vertical jump of 38.5 inches was the sixth-best recorded by a cornerback. Maryland coaches reportedly told Redskins head coach Jim Zorn that Barnes was "maybe the only guy in that league who could run with wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey," who recorded the fastest 40-yard dash time at the combine and was selected seventh overall in the draft.
Zorn also said, "were impressed when we watched him on video, when we interviewed him and talked to people who knew him." Referring to his height and speed, he described Barnes as a leaner version of Carlos Rogers. Unlike some other NFL teams, the Redskins were not concerned about Barnes' injury, and Zorn said his shoulder "was repaired... He's not going to have a problem at all." His mother is an avid fan of the Dallas Cowboys, the Redskins' biggest rivals. Barnes himself said, "The first team I liked was the Cowboys, so how ironic that I would go to the Redskins, but I love to be a Redskin." After summer minicamp, the Redskins signed Barnes to a four-year contract with a $782,000 signing bonus. Regarding his offseason performance, the club's executive vice president, Vinny Cerrato, said, "It was like a light came on, so Kevin was just playing instead of thinking all the time... He had four interceptions and was really breaking on the ball." Barnes was expected to compete with Justin Tryon for the fourth cornerback position on the depth chart.
2010 season.
In camp before the 2010 season, Barnes and veteran cornerback Phillip Buchanon out-performed Tryon, who was eventually traded to the Indianapolis Colts. At the start of the season, with Zorn replaced by Mike Shanahan as head coach, Barnes and linebacker Brian Orakpo were the only players retained from the 2009 draft class. In the second half against the New York Giants, Barnes replaced Buchanon, whom coach Shanahan said "wasn't playing good enough in the first half." Barnes recorded three tackles and defended one pass in the game, which was his most extensive playing time to that point. Against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Barnes started as a safety alongside Macho Harris because of injuries suffered by LaRon Landry, Kareem Moore, and Reed Doughty. In that game, Barnes intercepted a pass from David Garrard in overtime, which set up the game-winning field goal, 20–17.
Prior to the 2011 season, Barnes was named as an Honorable Mention player on ESPN's list of the top 25 breakout players of the 2011 season. Multiple depth charts list Barnes as the starting nickelback and immediate back-up to DeAngelo Hall. Coaches have praised Barnes for his hard work ethic and knowledge of the game.
Kevin Barnes intercepted a pass thrown by Tony Romo on Monday Night Football in a Redskins loss (18–16) against the Dallas Cowboys.
2011 season.
After Carlos Rogers left the team, Barnes switched from his original jersey number of 25 to 22. In the 2011 season, he would serve as the team's nickel cornerback. He would have his first interception of the season and second of his career in Week 3 against the Dallas Cowboys.
Barnes would catch another interception in Week 10 against the Miami Dolphins after nose tackle, Barry Cofield, hit Matt Moore's arm while throwing a pass.
He finished the season with 26 combined tackles, four pass breakups, and two interceptions.
2012 season.
Despite being used as a nickelback last season, it was reported that Barnes has been taking snaps at both the free safety and outside cornerback positions in the 2012 off-season under new defensive backs coach, Raheem Morris. With DeAngelo Hall taking over the nickelback position, he competed with and lost to the Redskins' free agent acquisition, Cedric Griffin, for the second outside cornerback slot opposite to starter, Josh Wilson.
Detroit Lions.
On August 27, 2012, Barnes was traded to the Detroit Lions for an undisclosed draft pick. He was waived on September 18.
Cleveland Browns.
On March 25, 2013, Barnes signed a one-year contract with the Cleveland Browns. He was released on May 13, 2013.

Zero Cipher

Zero Cipher were a metal/rock/alternative band from Farnham, Surrey. The band formed in the year 1998 from members of other bands within their local area. They played a style of music that fuses metal, rock, and industrial, although they cite wide ranging influences like Carcass, Wham, and Depeche Mode. Googlism describes them as 'noisecore mixed with turntablism'. They broke up in October 2009, citing numerous reasons behind the decision.
Overview.
Zero Cipher take their name from a mathematical riddle based on "cryptography". They have released albums on Anticulture records, and Deck Cheese records, as well as self-funded releases on Copro records, and their own label, Null Void records. They have played in the past with bands such as Skindred, Stampin' Ground and Breed 77; and have been supported by the likes of Enter Shikari and Bullet For My Valentine. They were the last band to tour with rap/metalcore band One Minute Silence in July 2003, and OMS' singer Yap performs guest vocals on "My Statement of Misintent", a track on their second album "Diary of a Sadist".
Recent news.
Zero Cipher have a third album, titled "Juggernaut" due out in 2009.
An early demo from "Juggernaut", titled "Fist of the North Star" was released by "Metal Hammer" magazine in November 2007, to coincide with their appearance at the Hard Rock Hell festival with Cradle of Filth and Twisted Sister - The band have also been featured by Rock Sound, Kerrang and Big Cheese, leading to performances at Kerrang's Scumfest and a European tour with Austrians, 'Spout', including a performance at Rock Im Park festival.
History.
Line-up changes.
Zero Cipher changed rhythm section in 2003, appointing Ryan Harris of Fony on bass guitar.
Video Controversy.
Zero Cipher's video for the track "Stupid People Make Me Angry" was playlisted on Totalrock Radio and Scuzz TV. Subsequent Zero Cipher videos have failed to make such an impact on mainstream music television, with MTV2 turning down the videos for "The Hijack" and "The Thrills, The Kills, The Rapture" because of their depictions of drug use and/or violence. Organ TV, a Public-access television cable TV channel, screened the TV premier of the video for 2005 single "It's No Secret"
Endorsements.
Somewhat unusually for an unsigned band, Zero Cipher were endorsed by Marshall amplifiers before ever releasing an album. In 2006, Duncan became endorsed by Vigier guitars, who made him a custom all-black "Indus" model. Duncan subsequently appeared at the London International Music Show in 2008 on the Vigier stage.

DB Class 724

The Class 724 operated by the German national railway, Deutsche Bundesbahn, was a railway department vehicle used for testing Indusi installations. Only three examples of this class existed.
724 001.
After its retirement on 21 June 1963, having clocked up 1,236,000 kilometres, the Uerdingen railbus VT 95 906, one of the original prototypes of its class, was converted in the repair shop ("Ausbesserungswerk" or "Aw") at Kassel into a test vehicle for "Indusi" railway installations. Designated as 6205 Wt it began its new duties on 25 February 1964 at "Bahnbetriebswerk" ("Bw") Wuppertal and replaced the measurement draisine previously used for this task. On 1 January 1968 it was given the number 724 001-3. The installation of testing magnets on both sides of the vehicle in 1971 considerably improved its utility, making it possible to test station entry and exit signals in one pass. Number 724 001 was retired on 18 January 1986 at "Bw" Heidelberg. Since then the vehicle was left by itself for many years and eventually stood in a very dilapidated state in front of Worms locomotive shed. In 2007 the railbus was bought up by the "Vulkaneifelbahn" and taken away to Gerolstein, where the intention is to restore it in the medium-term.
No. 724 001 is the last existing Uerdingen railbus prototype, the former Class VT 95. 
724 002 and 724 003.
Because more and more lines were equipped with Indusi, one vehicle no longer proved sufficient. So in 1972 the retired railbuses, VT 795 144 and 471, were also converted to test vehicles, again at Aw Kassel, and numbered as 724 002-1 and 724 003-9.

Nayeemul Islam Khan

Nayeemul Islam Khan (; born 1958) is a renowned media personality in Bangladesh who has been active in Bangladeshi journalism since 1982. He is currently the editor of the Bengali-language daily "Amader Orthoneeti". He is best known for his introduction of the modern approach of Bengali daily newspapers with the illustrated daily, "Ajker Kagoj", launched in 1990. He was also the founding editor of the popular daily "Amader Shomoy" in 2003. He frequently appears on TV talk-shows since 2007.
Life.
Born on 21 January 1958, Nayeemul Islam Khan is from Comilla. He was the eldest among the 6 children of Nurul Islam Khan, a politician and lawyer, and Nurun Nahar Khan, their mother. He studied at the Comilla Zilla School and passed SSC examination, then went to Dhaka University and obtained his B.A and M.A in Mass Communication & Journalism. He married poet and physician Taslima Nasreen in 1990; they divorced in 1991. He worked with the Bangladesh Center for Development and Journalism and married Nasima Khan. In 2007 he joined the Stamford University, Dhaka as an adjunct faculty in the Department of Journalism and Media Studies.
Career in journalism.
Nayeemul Islam Khan's debut as an editor was for the short-lived monthly magazine "Shomoy" that was published for a few months in 1982. His next project was editing "Khoborer Kagoj", which made its debut as a weekly in 1987. He is acclaimed as the father of modern approach to the Bengali-language newspaper for his work at "Ajker Kahoj", in which he served as editor from its founding 1990 until 1992. In 2002, he re-joined the "Ajker Kahoj" as advisory editor. That newspaper later closed in 2007. In 1992, he also founded another Bengali-language daily "Bhorer Kagoj", which was later edited by Matiur Rahman. Both "Ajker Kahoj" and "Bhorer Kagoj" were non-traditional in style and tone. He quit the "Bhorer Kagoj" in 1992 to run the non-governmental organization Bangladesh Centre for Development, Journalism and Communication. In 2003, he made an abortive attempt to publish another daily under the title "Notundhara". He also started his own daily, "Amader Shomoy" in 2007 but was removed as publisher by a court order in 2012. It was a four-page daily that cost TK 2.
In Taslima's "KA".
In the third volume of her autobiography "Ka", Taslima described Nayeemul as an unimpressive figure. He insisted that she have an abortion, as he suspected that the child she was carrying was not his own. After this they were soon divorced.
Attacked.
In 2013, Khan and his wife were returning home from a social event on 11 March when his car, which was clearly marked as a car belonging to the media, was attacked with molotov cocktails, one of which hit the car. He and his wife had to go to the hospital for treatment. The source of the attacks is unknown. The International Federation of Journalists believed he could have been targeted as he had been making frequent television appearances. The Committee to Protect Journalists called for quick investigations and demanded the violence directed against journalists be stopped.

Callophrys gryneus

The Juniper Hairstreak ("Callophrys" [="Mitoura"] "gryneus") is a butterfly native to North America. It belongs in the family Lycaenidae.
Description.
"For a key to the terms used see Lepidopteran glossary"
The Juniper Hairstreak has many subspecies or races, some of which may even be separate species. The upper side of the "Olive" Juniper Hairstreak ("Callophrys gryneus gryneus") is tawny orange or a bronzy color in males, and blackish brown in females. The underside of the wings is bright green with a variable amount of brown scaling. There are two white postbasal spots and a white zigzag postmedian line edged inward with brown on the hind wing.
"Sweadner's" Juniper Hairstreak ("Callophrys gryneus sweadneri") is very similar to the "gryneus" race except the two white postbasal spots are reduced.
The "Siva" Juniper Hairstreak ("Callophrys gryneus siva") is also similar to the "gryneus" race. It lacks the postbasal spots, the postmedian line is straight, and some individuals are brown. Intermediates of the "gryneus" and "siva" races occur in west Texas and New Mexico.
The underside of "Nelson's" Juniper Hairstreak ("Callophrys gryneus nelsoni") is brown with a violet sheen; the white postmedian line is faint, sometimes partial or absent; and the postbasal spots are lacking.
"Muir's" Juniper Hairstreak ("Callophrys gryneus muiri") is similar to the "nelsoni" race except the underside of the wings are a darker brown with a purplish-greenish tint, and the postmedian line is partial to complete.
The underside of the "Loki" Juniper Hairstreak ("Callophrys gryneus loki") is green to purplish-brown. Inward of the white postmedian line, the hind wing often has a dark band.
"Thorne's Juniper Hairstreak ("Callophrys gryneus thornei") is quite similar to the "loki" race except it usually lacks green more often being a violet-brown to a brownish-gray color.
Similar Species.
The Hessel's Hairstreak ("Callophrys hesseli") is the only similar species in the Juniper Hairstreak's range. The Hessel's Hairstreak is similar to the "gryneus" and "sweadneri" races. It is often more of a blue-green color, the postmedian line is edged with brown on both sides, and it has a white spot near the fore wing costa.
Habitat.
Habitats include bluffs, open fields, barrens, and dry or rocky open places. They are almost always found near or on junipers in these habitats.
Nectar Plants.
Both sexes visit flowers near the host plant, especially the "sweadneri" race.
Life cycle.
Males are highly territorial on cedar trees, where they perch in search of females. Often, males can be set in flight by gently shaking the trees. Females lay their eggs singly at the tip of host plant leaves. The eggs are pale green with white ridges. The larvae are vivid green with a faint middorsal stripe that begins at the thorax and runs down the abdomen. Whitish-yellow spots occur on either side of the middorsal stripe. A whitish-yellow subspiracular stripe (sometimes broken between segments) runs the length of the body. The chrysalis of the "gryneus" race is brown to pale brown and is mottled with black with the abdomen being a bit reddish. Chrysalids of western races are dark brown. The Juniper Hairstreak overwinters as a chrysalis. The "gryneus" race has 2 broods per year; "sweadneri", 2 broods per year; "siva", 2-3 broods per year; "nelsoni", 1 brood; "muiri", 1 brood; "loki", 1-2 broods; and the "thornei" race has 1 brood per year.
Host Plants.
Here is a list of host plants used by the Juniper Hairstreak:

<doc id="20822735" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20822735" title="Neilson v Harford">
Neilson v Harford

Neilson v Harford (1841) 151 ER 1266 is a 19th-century English patent law decision that several United States Supreme Court patent law opinions rely upon as authority. The question, as Baron Alderson posed it, was “is the difference between claiming a principle, which is to be carried into effect any way you will, and claiming a mere principle?” The answer, as the opinions of the various courts that have considered the matter develop, is "nowhere".
Facts.
Neilson discovered that a blast furnace for converting high-carbon iron to lower-carbon iron or steel worked better if the air was heated before being blown through the molten iron. He therefore passed the air through a heated chamber on its way to the molten iron. The relevant technology is discussed elsewhere in Wikipedia.
Judgment.
The Exchequer Court rejected the argument that the patent merely covered the principle that furnace temperature could be increased by injecting hot air instead of cold air into the furnace, for the principle of itself could not be patented. It ruled instead that the patent covered the use of the heated chamber. Baron Parke observed, 
Application.
The United States Supreme Court explained the "Neilson" decision in "O’Reilly v. Morse": 
It is very difficult to distinguish it Neilson patent from the specification of a patent for a principle, and this at first created in the minds of the Court much difficulty; but after full consideration, we think that the plaintiff does not merely claim a principle, but a machine, embodying a principle, and a very valuable one. We think the case must be considered as if the principle being well known, the plaintiff had first invented a mode of applying it. We think this case must also be considered as if the principle or mathematical formula were well known.
In "Parker v. Flook", the Supreme Court emphasized and adopted Baron Parke’s statement in "Neilson" (repeated in "Morse") that “the case must be considered as if, the principle being well known, the plaintiff had first invented a mode of applying it by a mechanical apparatus,” which is to say that the abstract idea or natural principle must be considered as if part of the prior art and the invention, if any, is in the mechanical implementation of the principle. Thus, if the implementation is concededly conventional, as it was in "Flook", or trivial, as it was in "Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co.", the subject matter cannot be patented. This analysis was repeated in "Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Labs., Inc."

Dudley Leavitt Pickman

Dudley Leavitt Pickman (1779–1846) was a Salem, Massachusetts, merchant who built one of the great Salem trading firms during the seaport's ascendancy as a trading power in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Pickman was a partner in the firm Devereux, Pickman & Silsbee and a state senator. Among the wealthiest Salem merchants of his day, Pickman used his own clipper ships to trade with the Far East in an array of goods ranging from indigo and coffee to pepper and spices, and was one of the state's earliest financiers, backing everything from cotton and woolen mills to railroads to water-generated power plants. Pickman also helped found what is today's Peabody Essex Museum.
Early life and career.
Dudley Leavitt Pickman was born at Salem, Massachusetts, in May 1779, the second son of Salem's chief Naval Officer, William Pickman (1779–1815) and his wife Elizabeth (Leavitt) Pickman, daughter of Dudley Leavitt, an early Congregational minister in Salem, and his wife Mary (Pickering) Leavitt, sister of United States Secretary of State Timothy Pickering. William Pickman secured his son After working briefly for Hiller, Dudley Leavitt Pickman left the Customs Service in 1799 to go to sea as a ship's supercargo – business agent for the owner.
Pickman embarked on a merchant's career as a young man. He helped found the East-India Marine Society (today's Peabody Essex Museum) of Salem in November 1800. (Joining two months prior was the eminent Salem merchant Elias Hasket Derby as well as Nathaniel Bowditch). In 1804 the East-India Marine Society moved to the Pickman Building on Essex Street, which had been specially fitted for the society.
Early in his career, Pickman traveled to India as supercargo on a ship belonging to several Salem merchants. In his diary of the journey, "Journal of the Belisarius", Pickman noted the appearance of the British fort at Calcutta: "Fort St. George is a handsome brick fortification. It appears very strong, but is probably too much extended to make as able a defense as might otherwise be done." 
Pickman kept journals on several of his other voyages as supercargo and then owner, and as its charter required, these journals were filed with the East-India Marine Society of Salem. These early documents show the vast reach of the large Salem trading houses. In 1799–1800, for instance, Pickman noted that the "Belisarius" had traveled first to the island of Tenerife, back to Salem, then on to Madras and Tranquebar, India, before returning to the Massachusetts port loaded with her bounty. The following year, Pickman kept the journal of the voyage of the ship "Anna", captained by Benjamin Swett, which sailed from Boston to Sumatra and back in 1801. 
Pickman made his early career out of repeated trips on the "Belisarius". Before the ship went to pieces in a gale in the Bay of Tunis in April 1810, the clipper made repeated voyages to India and Sumatra with several captains in command and Pickman acting as supercargo. The clipper ship's voyages prompted Salem cleric Dr. William Bentley to call her "one of the richest ships of our port." (Capt. Samuel Skerry, the most renowned of the "Belisarius"'s captains, died at age 36 after being kicked in the head by a horse.)
Later career.
Pickman soon founded his own trading firm. He and his partners owned an array of clipper ships including the brig "Endeavor", the "Malay", the "Borneo", the "Belisarius", the "Herald", the "Coromandel", the "Persia", the "Friendship" and others. The ships traded with India, Zanzibar, Madagascar, Sumatra, Java, the Philippines, Malaya and other far-flung trading ports.
Initially a partner of the Salem trading firm of Stone, Silsbees, Pickman & Allen, Pickman later became one of two partners of the firm of Silsbee & Pickman, one of the largest Salem trading houses, operated by Nathaniel Silsbee and Pickman. His firm was so influential that was known in Salem as "The Old East-India Company."
As Pickman's business investments took off, he became an active financier, and owned interests in emerging industries across New England. He was a founding investor in the companies that developed the water power and owned much of the real estate in Lowell, Manchester and Lawrence. He was also a large stockholder in many cotton and woolen mills in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and was a large investor in many early railroad companies.
Pickman was an active merchant, writing to politicians such as Henry Clay to promote his mercantile interests and arguing for the need for protective tariffs. Pickman also frequently corresponded with other powerful merchants and statesmen such as Paine Wingate and Samuel Curwen.
Pickman was heavily involved in nearly all aspects of Salem's municipal and business life. He served with Leverett Saltonstall and Nathaniel Bowditch as trustees of the estate of Simon Forrester. A ship captain born in Ireland, Forrester had become one of the pioneers of Salem merchant shipping and became one of Salem's leading merchants and philanthropists.
The large brick mansion built for Pickman by architect Jabez Smith in 1819 at the corner of Chestnut and Pickering Streets in Salem was later known as the Shreve-Little House (and later still as the Baldwin-Lyman House). Pickman married on September 6, 1810, Catherine Saunders, daughter of Salem merchant Thomas Saunders
Dudley Leavitt Pickman was a longtime member of Salem's old North Church. His portrait is owned by the Peabody Essex Museum, where it forms part of a collection of the founders of Salem's East India Marine Society in 1799. In the Massachusetts Historical Society is a copy of William Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" from the library of Dudley Pickman Leavitt – a copy of the first publication in America of the English playwright's work.
Descendants and legacy.
Dudley Leavitt Pickman's son William Dudley Pickman continued the family trading enterprises, eventually moving the shipping interests to Boston but retaining a counting house in Salem. William Dudley Pickman married Caroline Silsbee, daughter of Salem merchant Zachariah F. Silsbee. William Dudley Pickman's partner in the Boston-based firm was his son Dudley Leavitt Pickman, as well as a trustee of Salem's Peabody Museum. 
Dudley Leavitt Pickman's daughter Elizabeth became the second wife of Salem merchant Richard Saltonstall Rogers, whose first wife Sarah Crowninshield died young. Pickman's daughter Catherine Saunders married Boston merchant Richard S. Fay. One of Pickman's sons, Edward Motley, attended Harvard Law School, and became a Boston writer.
His son Dudley Leavitt Pickman Jr. attended Noble and Greenough School, Harvard College, where he was president of the Hasty Pudding Club, and Harvard Law School, practiced law in Boston and lived in a 40-room granite mansion, staffed by five servants and designed by architect Stanford White at 191 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, as well as in Beverly, Massachusetts. He served as a director for a number of public companies, including a subsidiary of Calumet and Hecla Mining Company and as one of the first three trustees of the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow House National Park site in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
Dudley Leavitt Pickman Jr. continued the family's tradition of making gifts of significant family heirlooms and antiques to the collection of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, including a teapot by silversmith John Coburn bearing the Pickman family coat of arms. Born in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1885, Dudley Leavitt Pickman Jr. also became a noted mountaineer and porcelain expert, who published several books on the subject. Along with his friends Harold Stirling Vanderbilt, Francis Bacon and Frederic Allen, Pickman played the first game of contract bridge in its modern form. He married the widow of Boston businessman Alexander Lynde Cochrane.
In its obituary of Dudley Leavitt Pickman Jr., "The New York Times" noted the lawyer and author's service as trustee of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, as well as his avocation as "a noted mountain climber". Pickman, who died at his residence at 38 Beacon Street on Beacon Hill, was 87.
The Pickman family intermarried with other prominent early Salem and Boston families, including that of Joseph Story Fay, the Crowninshields, the Pickerings, the Rodmans, the Silsbees, Rogers, Saunders and Motleys and others. 
The family also later owned an estate located near Two Brothers Rocks in Bedford, Massachusetts, so named because the lands were patented by both Massachusetts Bay Colony governors John Winthrop and Thomas Dudley. Dudley Leavitt Pickman and his progeny were descended from both early governors.
The Salem merchant Dudley Leavitt Pickman is buried at Salem's Harmony Grove Cemetery, not far from the grave of his partner, merchant and United States Senator from Massachusetts Nathaniel Silsbee. Pickman's tombstone reads: "A successful merchant, distinguished for his sound practical good sense and an inflexible regard to truth and justice."

Pastoral (theatre of Soule)

The pastoral is a traditional kind of play from the Basque Country held in the region of Soule (Zuberoa in Basque), France. It features a set range of characters and acts repeated on all pieces. This kind of theatre represents a dualism between the wicked (dressed in red, called "türkak" or "satanak", literally 'the Turkish' or 'the Demons') and the righteous (blue outfit, called "kiristiak", 'the Christians'). On every new creation, a different story is staged, where verses are recited in Zuberoan Basque by the players following a pre-established stance and steps on the scene. Singing and dance play an important role too, the performance actually culminating with a choral staging where the collective spirit is voiced. The development of the story is supported by a brass-band and/or the xirula and the psalterium (ttun-ttun).
Unlike the other traditional theatrical event of Soule, the maskarada, the pastoral is not a comedy but a tragedy, revolving around a main character, a hero of historical significance, linked to the region or the Basque Country, while prior to the second half of the 20th century the characters portrayed were religious or French national icons. Back then women were banned from playing in the pastorals too, with female roles being performed by men. During the revival of the event in the decades following World Word II, this rule was overturned and currently women take part normally in the plays.

Pu Yen

Yen Kaewmanee or Pu Yen (Grandpa Yen), Thai: ปู่เย็น was a famous centenarian who lived to an age of 108. The Thai-muslim man was known for his self-sufficient and economical way of living. His lifestyle embodied King Bhumibol Adulyadej's philosophy on self-sufficiency. The elderly man made his living fishing from the Phetchaburi River in Phetchaburi, Thailand. He sold the fish to locals at inexpensive prices in exchange for other necessities. For many years until his death, he refused offers of free food, preferring to live in his small boat.
Biography.
In 1993, Pu Yen's wife died. That's when he decided to save on rent by living in a small houseboat in Phetchaburi River. He lived on one small fish each day. If there were extra fish caught, he would sell them at inexpensive prices to locals.
In 2004, Pu Yen became famous when a documentary “Khon Kon Khon” was made about his life and nationally televised. In addition, he was officially recognized by Queen Sirikit and given a covered fiberglass boat on his 105th birthday.
Visitors who talked to him said that although he received many guests, he was always welcoming and cheerful to them. He maintained a positive attitude towards life and was a role model of self-sufficiency to many Thais.
Although Pu Yen lived in relative peace, he suffered a setback when thieves stole $2,060 in cash from his small boat.
Before his death, he lived a quiet life on his boat under the Lumyai (Longan) Bridge in Phetchaburi city. The place where he used to live is marked by a small landing with a small light bulb suspended from a tree.
After his death on October 12, 2008 from natural causes, he was buried in a local Phetchaburi mosque and the boat was donated to a local museum in the province.
Impact.
Pu Yen's life and death highlighted the plight of many elderly people in Thailand without adequate medical care and attention. Following his death, Thailand's Health Minister Chalerm Yubamrung issued orders for special check-up facilities for the elderly which would shorten the waiting time for receiving health care. Also, the Health Department chief Narongsak Ankhasuwapala has suggested that a club for the elderly be made available in every tambon. Currently, there are over 4,000 registered centenarians in Thailand.

<doc id="20822899" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20822899" title="Bootstrapping node">
Bootstrapping node

A bootstrapping node, also known as a rendezvous host, is a node in an overlay network that provides initial configuration information to newly joining nodes so that they may successfully join the overlay network. Bootstrapping nodes are predominantly found in decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) networks because of the dynamically changing identities and configurations of member nodes in these networks.
Overview.
When attempting to join a P2P network, specific discovery or membership protocols (or other configuration information) may be required, and, if a newly joining node is unaware of these protocols, the newly established joining node will not be able to communicate with other nodes and ultimately join the network. Furthermore, these protocols and configuration requirements may dynamically change as the infrastructure and membership of the P2P network evolves. Therefore, there is a need to be able to dynamically inform a newly joining node of the required protocols and configurations.
Identifying a bootstrapping node.
A newly joining node may identify which nodes are bootstrapping nodes by using multiple different ways. New nodes may be pre-configured at creation with static addresses of the bootstrapping nodes. In such a case, the bootstrapping node addresses can not change, and therefore should be stable members of the network. Stable, in this case, meaning fault-tolerant and having no desire to leave the network. Alternatively, the bootstrap node can be identified via a DNS service, where a domain name resolves to one of the bootstrapping nodes' addresses. This allows the bootstrapping nodes' addresses to change as needed, and overly stable nodes are therefore not necessary.
Configuration information provided.
The objective of the bootstrapping node is to provide newly joining nodes with sufficient configuration information so that the new node may then successfully join the network and access resources, such as shared content. Discovery protocol information can instruct the new node how to discover peers on the network. Membership protocol information can instruct the new node how to request-to-join and subsequently join peer groups on the network. Other configuration information, such as overlay network dependent instructions, may be provided. An example of overlay dependent instructions is instructing a new node how to obtain a zone of a CAN. Further configuration information may be designed for P2P network admission control, used when joining a network that supports trust management, and include such things as encryption/signature protocols or admission policies.

Journey's End (1930 film)

"Journey's End" is a 1930 British-American war film directed by James Whale. Based on the play of the same name by R. C. Sherriff, the film tells the story of several British soldiers involved in trench warfare during the First World War. The film, like the play before it, was an enormous critical and commercial success and launched the film careers of Whale and several of its stars.
The following year there was a German film version "Die andere Seite" directed by Heinz Paul starring Conrad Veidt as Stanhope and Wolfgang Liebeneiner as Raleigh. The film was banned just weeks after the Nazis took power in 1933.
In 1976, the film was remade as "Aces High" with the scenario of the play and 1930 film shifted to the British Royal Flying Corps.
Plot.
On the eve of a battle in 1918, a new officer, Second Lieutenant Raleigh (David Manners), joins Captain Stanhope's (Colin Clive) company in the British trench lines in France. While the two men knew each other at school, Stanhope loves Raleigh's sister. Raleigh sees a changed man, who after three years at the front, is on the verge of a breakdown and has turned to drink. A fellow officer, Lieutenant Osborne (Ian Maclaren) desperately tries to keep Stanhope from cracking. Osborne and Raleigh are selected to lead a raiding party on the German trenches where many soldiers are killed, including Osborne. Although he resents the younger man, when Raleigh is mortally wounded, the commander faces a desperate time, friendless and grief-stricken, he prepares to face another furious enemy attack.
Production.
When Howard Hughes made the decision to turn "Hell's Angels" into a talkie, he hired a then-unknown James Whale, who had just arrived in Hollywood following a successful turn directing the play "Journey's End" in London and on Broadway, to direct the talking sequences; it was Whale's film debut, and arguably prepared him for the later success he would have with the feature version of "Journey's End", "Waterloo Bridge", and, most famously, the 1931 version of "Frankenstein". Unhappy with the script, Whale brought in Joseph Moncure March to re-write it. Hughes later gave March the Luger pistol used in the famous execution scene of the film's ending.
With production delayed while Hughes tinkered with the flying scenes in "Hell's Angels", Whale managed to shoot his film adaptation of "Journey's End" and have it come out a month before "Hell's Angels" was released. The gap between completion of the dialogue scenes and completion of the aerial combat stunts allowed Whale to be paid, sail back to England, and begin work on the subsequent project, making Whale's actual (albeit uncredited) cinema debut, his "second" film to be released.

The Good Companions (musical)

The Good Companions is a musical with a book by Ronald Harwood, music by André Previn, and lyrics by Johnny Mercer. It is based on the 1929 novel of the same title by J. B. Priestley.
Plot.
The plot focuses on the trials and tribulations of a touring concert party known as the Dinky-Doos who are stranded in the English countryside when their manager absconds with the most recent box office revenue and the lady pianist. Jess Oakroyd, an amiable man who has abandoned his shrewish wife, endears himself to the company with his homespun advice, and they invite him to join them as a carpenter, baggage handler, and dogsbody. Elizabeth Trant comes to their rescue when she decides to use her inheritance to finance the troupe and escape from her boring life in the Cotswolds.
Because of his habit of playing the piano late at night, songwriter Inigo Jollifant has been fired from his position at the Washbury Manor School in East Anglia, and he replaces the concert party's recently departed pianist, bringing with him banjo player and illusionist Morton Mitcham. As Miss Trant slowly achieves managerial authority, she encourages the troupe - which includes comedienne Susie Dean and singer Jerry Jerningham - to change its name to The Good Companions.
They continue their tour and eventually arrive at the Sandybay Pavilion, where they play to a full house when a storm forces passersby to seek shelter in the theatre. Their success leads Inigo to contact a music publisher, who buys his songs and arranges for an impresario to see The Good Companions in Sandybay. The producer signs Susie and Jerry for his new revue, and he secures the remaining members of the company bookings in high class towns like Bournemouth.
In the end, Miss Trant marries her solicitor, Susie heads to the West End, Inigo makes a fortune with his music, and Jess Oakroyd departs for Ontario, Canada to visit his daughter.
Productions.
After a tryout in Manchester, "The Good Companions" opened on July 11, 1974 at Her Majesty's Theatre in London and ran for 252 performances. The cast included John Mills as Jess Oakroyd, Judi Dench as Elizabeth Trant, Christopher Gable as Inigo Jollifant, Marti Webb as Susie Dean, Malcolm Rennie as Morton Mitcham, and Ray C. Davis as Jerry Jerningham. The score was orchestrated by Herbert W. Spencer and Angela Morley. An original cast album was released on compact disc by DRG in September 1992. 
The concept of a concert party was foreign to American audiences, and a non-musical stage adaptation of the Priestly novel had closed on Broadway after only 68 performances in 1931 so, despite the popularity of the Previn/Mercer score, it was decided not to open a production in New York City. When a proposed West End revival failed to materialize, Warner-Chappell London granted 42nd Street Moon, a San Francisco company whose mission is to present staged concert revivals of "lost" musicals, the rights to present the American premiere of "The Good Companions", which it did in August 2000.

Prussian G 8.3

The Prussian G 8.3 was a 2-8-0, superheated, freight locomotive with three cylinders. It was developed to redress the lack of goods locomotives after the First World War. The inspiration to design a 2-8-0 locomotive based on the 2-10-0 Prussian G 12 came from Württemberg. The first vehicle was delivered in 1918. Compared with the G 12, the G 8.3 had one boiler shell and coupled axle fewer. After it had proved itself, a total of 85 examples of the G 8.3 were placed in service, all of which were taken over by the Reichsbahn, where they were numbered 56 101–185. No more were built thereafter because the G 8.2, with only two cylinders, was less costly to procure and maintain.
Of the 68 engines that survived the Second World War, 6 went into the Deutsche Bundesbahn, who transferred them in 1948 to private railways, and 62 to the DR in East Germany. The DR machines were retired by 1967.
The vehicles were equipped with Prussian pr 3 T 20 tenders.

Pauline Fjelde

Pauline Fjelde (1861 – December 23, 1923) was a Norwegian born American painter, embroiderer, and textile artist. 
Background.
Pauline Gerhardine Fjelde was born in Ålesund, Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. She and her family immigrated to the United States in 1887. Pauline Fjelde is one of a lineage of family artisans. Her brother Jacob Fjelde created many of the sculptures found in Minneapolis parks. Pauline Fjelde was also the aunt of noted American sculptor Paul Fjelde and the great-aunt of his son, Ibsen scholar Rolf G. Fjelde.
Career.
Pauline Fjelde was a highly skilled textile artist. She studied gobelin weaving at the Gobelins Manufactory in Paris. She was associated with the development of the European Arts and Crafts movement within Norwegian-American textile arts. She was perhaps most notable for having embroidered the first Minnesota State flag along with her sister Thomane Fjelde Hansen, who was also an accomplished textile artist. 
In 1893, the Minnesota State Legislature commissioned the design of an official state flag for display at an exhibit at the fairgrounds in Chicago at the World’s Columbian Exposition. Amelia Hyde Center submitted the winning design. Pauline Fjelde and her sister, Thomane, were contracted to produce the actual prototype flag. The Minnesota flag earned a gold medal for embroidery at the Chicago exposition.
Legacy.
Her works have been on display at the Minneapolis Institute of the Arts and are in a permanent collection at Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum in Decorah, Iowa. Some of her oil paintings also reside at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The Hennepin History Museum maintains a file containing her career. Family photos are in the Minnesota Historical Society database.

Achille Lauro

Achille Lauro (16 June 1887, Piano di Sorrento - 15 November 1982, Naples) was an Italian businessman and politician.
Life.
Born the fifth of six children of the shipowner Gioacchino and of Laura Cafiero, he was on his part the shipowner and founder of the "Flota Lauro", one of the most powerful Italian fleets of all time and one of the major fortunes in the south of Italy, in addition to the owner of a true financial empire created by himself. A determining fact in marking the force of his activities was his genial intuition that his workers should participate in the benefits of their activities.
Often found in society news for his frequent romantic encounters, the popular tradition recorded legendary characteristics to his amatory capacities.
As a politician, he maintained a great popularity and was venerated by the majority of the population of the city of Naples, to the point that in the municipal elections of 1952 and 1956 he received almost 300,000 votes, higher than any number of votes received by any candidate in local elections up to that point. In the general elections of 1953, he received 680,000 votes for the Chamber of Deputies, also a number that had never been achieved before.
During the decades of Italian fascism, he was named the National Counsellor of the Chamber of the fasces and the corporations, appointed to this position by Galeazzo Ciano, the son-in-law of Benito Mussolini himself, who was active in shipping commerce. Also during this period he was named president of the Naples football club SSC Napoli, where he succeeded Giorgio Ascarelli. 
After the war, after an initial participation in the Common Man's Front, he became active in the monarchist movement of Alfredo Covelli and financially supported the birth of the Monarchist National Party (PNM), and was for a long time the mayor of Naples, appreciated and questioned for his management of the public funds.
A square in the coastal town of Sorrento is named in his honour.

Rocky Mountain Fuel Company

The Rocky Mountain Fuel Company was a coal mining company located in Colorado, operating mines in Louisville, Lafayette, and other locations north and west of Denver. The mine was founded by John J. Roche to supply coal to sugar beet factories. During the 1930s, the company was the second-largest producer of coal by volume in the state of Colorado. However, the company was severely impacted by the Great Depression, declining productivity of local coal deposits, and the increased popularity of natural gas, and went bankrupt in 1944.
The mine is notable among the many coal mines operating in the same region at the time for its leadership by Josephine Roche. She inherited a minority stock ownership from her father upon his death in 1927, becoming vice president of the company in 1928 and president by 1929. Roche was a dedicated believer in labor unions, and soon after becoming president she invited the United Mine Workers of America back to Rocky Mountain Fuel Company's mines, offering top pay and taking actions to repair labor-management relations. This was to the great chagrin of fellow mine owners, who broke the unions in 1914 after years of intense and often violent disputes, culminating in events such as the Columbine Mine and Ludlow Massacres. Roche's pro-labor policies, however, were effective - within a few years, the company's productivity per worker was the best in the state. After leaving the company in 1934 to enter politics, Roche returned in 1937, but even with the active support of her workers she was unable to save the company, which folded in 1944.

Spenceans.
During the early nineteenth century, the Jamaican-born activists William Davidson and Robert Wedderburn were drawn to the politics of Thomas Spence.
Aftermath of First World War.
Many African-Caribbean activists were radicalised while in the British West Indies Regiment (BWIR). Having served in Europe and the Middle East, many of them experienced racism from both British Officers and common soldiers, which alienated them from British nationalism. Some of them from the 9th Battalion had participated in the Taranto Revolt, which started on 6 December 1918, shortly after the armistice. This was stimulated by the War Office refusing to allow the troops of the British West Indies Regiment receive the extra 6 pence a day which had been given to British soldiers. This was explained as being because they were "natives". The all-white Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps did receive the increment. They were also put to work as labourers for the White Italian Labour Corps. Officers were attacked and explosives and guns were used. The Worcestershire Regiment was dispatched to quell the revolt, and they executed one rebel by firing squad. Nevertheless, some 50 to 60 sergeants met on 17 December to form the "Caribbean League" which had four meetings in the next few weeks. Aside from addressing various grievances they had, pan-Caribbean sentiments were fostered, and a movement for independence in the West Indies was discussed. This included plans to set up an office in Kingston, Jamaica, and organise strikes. After being betrayed to the authorities, the league was disbanded. In February 1919, Army Order No. 1, granting the wage increase, was extended to the BWIR.

HMS Hecate (1809)

HMS "Hecate" was a Royal Navy 18-gun , built by John King at Upnor and launched in 1809. After serving in the British Navy, essentially entirely in the East Indies, she served in the Chilean Navy as "Galvarino" from 1818 until she was broken up in 1828.
Royal Navy service.
"Hecate" was commissioned in 1809 under Commander William Buchanan. Commander Edward Wallis Hoare replaced him in October and sailed for the East Indies on 31 October.
In 1810, Lieutenant George Rennie became acting commander and "Hecate" was detailed for service with the squadron under Admiral Albemarle Bertie engaged in the Invasion of Île de France. In 1814 she would share in the prize money resulting from the capture of the island.
In 1811 she was under Commander Thomas Graham until July, when Commander Henry John Peachey assumed command. From 3 August she was part of the fleet involved in the invasion of Java, which ended with the surrender of Dutch and French forces on 16 September. For this service all of her crew who had survived to 1847 and chose to were entitled to claim the Naval General Service Medal with clasp "Java". In 1815 "Hecate" also shared in the prize money arising out of the invasion.
Peachey was promoted to post-captain on 7 August 1812 and removed to . Lieutenant William Case may have followed Peachey as acting commander, but then the newly-promoted Commander Case took command of "Samarang", and Commander Joseph Drury transferred from "Samarang" to "Hecate". At some point in 1812 pirates from the Sultanate of Sambas, in western Borneo, captured nine sailors from "Hecate" and killed or enslaved them, after cutting their hamstrings or otherwise mutilating them. In June 1813 "Hecate" participated in a punitive expedition against the Sultanate of Sambas.
"Hecate" sailed for Madras in January 1814 and her next commander, from 4 February 1814, was Commander John Allen. On 20 November 1815 command passed to John Reynolds.
"Hecate" arrived in Portsmouth on 17 August 1816, from Trincomalee, which she had left on 20 March. She had sailed via the Cape of Good Hope and Saint Helena. On 22 May 1817 the Admiralty offered "Hecate", then lying at Portsmouth, for sale.
Chilean Navy service.
On 30 October 1817 the Admiralty sold "Hecate" to Mr. Parkin for £860. In Buenos Aires she was also known as the name "Lucy". She was resold to the Chilean Revolutionary government, arriving in Chile on 9 November 1818 under the command of Captain Guise. She served the new Chilean Navy as "Galvarino", first under Captain Spry (until Admiral Thomas Cochrane dismissed him) and then under Captain Winter. On 2 October 1819 she was at the second attack on Callao where a lieutenant onboard was killed by Spanish fire. In 1821, while under the command of Captain I. Esmond, her crew mutinied and refused to go to sea until they had received their back pay and prize money.
She participated in the Freedom Expedition of Perú, but after the final confrontation between San Martín and Cochrane and the subsequent loss of many officers and seamen to the new Peruvian Navy, the "Lautaro" and "Galvarino" were sent back to Valparaíso to ease the demand for seamen.
Fate.
She was broken up 1828.

John McIntire (pioneer)

John McIntire (October 15, 1759 – July 29, 1815) was the founder of the city of Zanesville, Ohio.
McIntire was born in Alexandria, Virginia. He married Sarah Zane, the daughter of Colonel Ebenezer Zane, in December 1789. McIntire founded Zanesville in 1797 on land deeded by Colonel Zane.
One family history claims that in 1802 while exiled from France, Louis Philippe, who later became King of France, stayed with the McIntires and was very impressed by them. United States Ambassador to France Lewis Cass, under pseudonym "An American", wrote "France: its King, Court and Government" in 1840. He had this to say of the King's tour through the Northwest: 
Parents.
Nothing certain is known of McIntire's background prior to his arrival in Muskingum County, Ohio. A family history written by Isaac McIntire in 1902 claims that his parents were John McIntire of Scotland, Ireland, and Charlotte Hedge, an English woman. Currently this claim has not been proven.
Politics.
In 1802, Zanesville was still located in Washington County, and McIntire was elected as one of four Washington County delegates, along with Ephraim Cutler, Benjamin Ives Gilman and Rufus Putnam, to the first Constitutional Convention of Ohio which met November 1-29, 1802. 
Epitaph.
A description of the life John McIntire appears on his gravestone. The epitaph is as follows: 
""Sacred to the memory of John McIntire, who departed this life July 29, 1815 aged 56 years. He was born at Alexandria, VA, laid out the town of Zanesville in 1800, of which he was the patron and father. He was a member of the convention which formed the constitution of Ohio. A kind husband, an obliging neighbor, punctual in his engagements, of liberal mind and benevolent disposition, his death was sincerely lamented.""
Namesake.
Mr. McIntire's memory lives on in the town he founded. Places around Zanesville named for him include: John McIntire Library, John McIntire Elementary School, and McIntire Avenue.

Toledo-Lucas County Public Library

Toledo-Lucas County Public Library is a public library located in Toledo, Ohio. It has the fifth largest collection in the state and has been ranked by the Hennen American Public Library Rating (HALPR) as one of the top libraries in the United States.
History.
Dating back to 1838, the library was Ohio's first public library founded using tax money. The main library on Michigan Avenue officially opened on September 5, 1940. The current system was created when the Toledo Public, Lucas County, and Sylvania Public libraries merged. In 2001, the library had a major expansion and restoration, which added to an Art Deco facility.
Collection.
Toledo-Lucas County Public Library is Ohio's fifth largest public library collection, because the main library holds 1.2 million reference materials, including books, DVDs, videos, and CDs. The library uses AuthorityWorks cataloging and uses Federated Search to sort all of this material, which is mostly Ohio and Michigan related. However, it also contains photographs, genealogical resource materials, periodicals, family histories, obituaries, court records, and archives from the "Toledo Blade". 
There is a single floor layout with 750 thousand books resting on 95% open stacks.
Almost one million resources are checked out every year by over 500 thousand patrons, who can make use of the discussion groups, meeting rooms, and/or 400 free internet-ready computers.
Branches.
The library has 18 branches: Birmingham Branch, Heatherdowns Branch, Holland Branch, Kent Branch, Lagrange Branch, Locke Branch, Maumee Branch, Mott Branch, Oregon Branch, Outreach Services, Point Place Branch, Reynolds Corners Branch, Sanger Branch, South Branch, Sylvania Branch, Toledo Heights Branch, Washington Branch, Waterville Branch, and West Toledo Branch.
Activities.
Currently, Toledo-Lucas County Public Library is working on setting a world record for the "largest shared learning experience that involves children and adults". The system also occasionally gives tours of downtown Toledo.

Prussian G 8

The Prussian Class G 8 locomotives were eight-coupled, superheated, freight locomotives operated by the Prussian state railways. There were two variants: the G 8 built from 1902 with a 14 tonne axle load and the "reinforced G 8" ("verstärkte G 8") built from 1913 (later designated the G 8.1) with a axle load. The latter was the most numerous German state railway ("Länderbahn") locomotive, over 5,000 examples being built.
History.
A total of 1,054 Prussian G 8 locomotives were built between 1902 and 1913 by various manufacturers. It was the first superheated goods train locomotive in Prussia, which is why it initially suffered from a host of teething troubles. One further problem was the restriction to a axle load; as a result many components had to be made too light in order to save weight. During its period of procurement constant modifications were made to the locomotives: the cylinder bore was increased from ; and the grate area, evaporative heating area and superheater area were also increased in size.
Seven engines were experimentally fitted with "Stumpf" parallel flow cylinders ("Gleichstrom-Zylindern"). Ten more were given Lenz valve gear. Neither of these variants improved on the standard design however.
After the First World War, 336 locomotives had to be given to Germany's former enemies as reparations and 18 units to the Saar Railway. In 1925 the Deutsche Reichsbahn took over 656 locomotives as Class 55.16-22, numbering them as 55 1601-2256 in their renumbering plan. In 1935 they were joined by another twelve were from the "Saarbahn", nos. 55 2257-2268. In the Second World War several more came from Poland and were given the numbers of already retired engines between 55 1604 and 55 1710.
After the war the DB ended up with 205 examples, and the DR 50. In the GDR the last one was retired in 1969, whereas the DB had retired them by 1955.
After the Second World War, locomotives 55 1681, 1881 and 2180 were left in Austria. No. 55 1881 was returned to the DB in 1950. The two remaining engines formed ÖBB Class 755 in the ÖBB keeping their serial numbers. Number 755.2180 was retired in 1954, and 755.1681 not until 1957.
Locomotive "Nr. 4981 Mainz" (see picture in the infobox) is in working condition. Built in 1913 by Hanomag as No. 6721 and in service with the Prussian state railways as "4981 Münster", it sent was to work in 1916, along with 24 others, on the construction of the Baghdad Railway (Bagdadbahn) in Turkey, where she was given Turkish Railways number 44 079. In 1987, the still operational locomotive was purchased by German railway fans, to be hauled across Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Austria to Germany and restored by the Darmstadt-Kranichstein Railway Museum. The journey, which had cost 47,000 deutschmarks of which 36,531 DM were invoiced by Deutsche Bahn for the leg in Germany, is documented in a book.
The locomotives were equipped with Prussian tenders of classes "pr 3 T 12", "pr 3 T 16.5" and pr 2'2' T 16.

Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference

Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference were biennial meetings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominion members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Seventeen Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences were held between 1944 and 1969. As well, the prime ministers met for a Commonwealth Economic Conference in 1952. These series of conferences were a continuation and regularisation of the earlier Imperial Conferences which had been held periodically from 1887 to 1937. Since 1971, Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings have been held.
Of the seventeen meetings, sixteen were held in London, reflecting then-prevailing views of the Commonwealth as the continuation of the British Empire and the centralisation of power in the British Commonwealth Office (the one meeting outside London, in Lagos, was an extraordinary meeting held in January 1966 to coordinate policies towards Rhodesia). Two supplementary meetings were also held during this period: a Commonwealth Statesmen's meeting to discuss peace terms in April 1945, and a Commonwealth Economic Conference in 1952.
The first British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference was held May 1–16, 1944 in order to coordinate the war effort. In attendance were: 
The British Commonwealth leaders agreed to support the Moscow Declaration and reached agreement regarding their respective roles in the overall Allied war effort.
Conferences consisted of the prime ministers or presidents of independent states as well as the premiers of some senior colonies. This policy changed with the 1964 Prime Ministers' Conference which was confined to independent states and thus excluded Southern Rhodesia whose prime ministers had attended Imperial and Commonwealth conferences since the 1930s. While the growing number of Commonwealth states was given as the reason for this change, it coincided with the emergence of white minority rule in Rhodesia as a major issue. 
The 1960s saw an overhaul of the Commonwealth. The swift expansion of the Commonwealth after decolonisation saw the newly independent countries demand the creation of the Commonwealth Secretariat, and the United Kingdom, in response, successfully founding the Commonwealth Foundation. This decentralisation of power demanded a reformulation of the meetings. Instead of the meetings always being held in London, they would rotate across the membership, subject to countries' ability to host the meetings: beginning with Singapore in 1971. They were also renamed the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings to reflect the growing diversity of the constitutional structures in the Commonwealth.

São Paulo School of Arts and Crafts

The School of Arts and Crafts of São Paulo () (LAOSP) is a Brazilian private civil society, whose main activities are involved with technical education. The institution also acts on cultural and industrial production.
Currently, the school of Arts and Crafts unfolds on three different bodies:
History.
The institution was created in 1873 by a group belonging to the elite of coffee aristocrats who intended to form specialized labor for a possible future industrialization of the country, according to the positivist ideal that preached the "dignity of man through work".
Initially it took the name "Propagator Society for People Instruction". During its early years, it was not intended to promote professional education. Nightly courses of first letters and Arithmetic, among others, were lectured for adults and children. Since then, however, there was already a Superior Council (chaired by the Director Leôncio de Carvalho) which represented the elite of Sao Paulo at that period.
After seven years, the Superior Council decided to completely reformulate the institution and turn it into a technical school. By then, the school had not yet a head office nor curriculum guidelines and the model adopted for the new institution was the European experiences of schools of Arts and Crafts (idealized by William Morris) . The "Arts and Crafts Movement" had already been happening in Europe for some time and preached the value of the manual work of craftsmen in the capitalist industry.
With the adoption of the name "Lyceu de Artes e Officios", the new model began to be applied and courses of carpentry, locksmiths, cast, design, among others, were lectured, in the spirit of bourgeois positivist-Arts and Crafts.
From 1890, architect Francisco Paula Ramos de Azevedo took the direction of the Liceu, and was responsible for a new reform of the school curriculum and administration that would make it thrive in an unprecedented manner.
Ramos de Azevedo was also a founder of Polytechnic School of the future University of São Paulo, and brought from Belgium an entrepreneurial spirit that would meet the interests of the Superior Council. From his reform on, the students of the school began receiving financial support for the work they produced. This work would carry the brand of quality of the school and sold throughout the country. With this model, the LAOSP has become self-sufficient and independent.
The school's financial prosperity enabled the creation of a permanent head office. In 1897 the Technical Office Ramos de Azevedo started the project the Praça da Luz building, which was never completely concluded, but was delivered in 1900. This building, through an agreement with the State of Sao Paulo, would be shared between the newly created LAOSP and the art gallery Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo.
Industrial production of Liceu prospered significantly during periods of World Wars, with the increased consumption of items produced in the country, due to the reduction of imports.
In this period, names like Victor Brecheret Alberto Santos-Dumont and Adoniran Barbosa have been through the School. It became the main promoter and director of works in art nouveau style in Brazil.
From the 1950s on, the country adopted new model of industrial development, and the craftsmen of the Lyceum became inadequate for the new production activities. There was a separation between the industrial activity of the institution and its educational section. All the original ideal of inseparability between art and industry was lost from there.
Among the products of this new industrial phase are the implementation of casings at the MASP; accomplishment of part of the furniture Cumbica International Airport and production of 24 hour cash machines.
In the 1970s, with a new curriculum reform, the Technical School itself is established. The first courses were Edification (EDI), Machinery and Engines (Into Mechanics - MEC - later), Decoration, Electronics (ELO) and later of Design Construction (DCC) and Electrotechnics. Four of these courses (EDI, ELO, MEC and DCC) represented the core teaching of the school and survived until 2002, the date of graduation of its latest class.
Throughout history, the school was guided by a group of principles of action generally linked to free education, vocational training and humanistics. Recently, however, through the reforms implemented by LAO-Industry, a paid model of education was instituted, and professional education was completely separated from regular high school course.
Works with the brand Liceu.
The following list comprises buildings and monuments in which there are records of the actions of the school, whether in its construction process or in the materials employed

Perceval Maitland Laurence

Sir Perceval Maitland Laurence (1854–1930) was an English classical scholar, judge in South Africa and a benefactor of the University of Cambridge.
Early life and education.
Perceval Maitland Laurence was born on 20 April 1854 in Woking the eldest son of Perceval Laurence, a clergyman and Isabella Sarah Moorsom.
In 1872 Laurence went up to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge to read Classics, graduating with first class honours in 1876. Like his father before him, he was President of the Cambridge Union Society, holding office in the Easter Term of 1874.
The law.
On graduating his studies turned to the law. As a fellow of Corpus Christi, he was awarded the Yorke Prize in 1878 for his essay, written jointly with Courtney Stanhope Kenny, on "The Law and Custom of Primogeniture", the Master of Laws degree in 1879, the Chancellor’s Gold Medal for Legal Studies and in 1885 the degree of Doctor of Laws.
Laurence was called to the Bar by Lincoln’s Inn on 18 November 1878 but the effects of tuberculosis curtailed his English practice of the law and took him instead to the Cape Colony for the beneficial effect of the drier climate. He practised initially in Kimberley before being appointed second puisne judge of the High Court of Griqualand in 1882 and subsequently becoming Judge President in 1888. Moving to Cape Town in 1905, he served as Chairman of the War Losses Compensation Commission and the Transvaal Delimitation Commissions, for which he was knighted in 1906.
Retirement.
In 1913 Laurence retired and returned to England and in 1914 was made an honorary fellow of Corpus Christi College. In 1921-23 he served on the Royal Commission on Fire Brigades and Fire Prevention. His final work was a biography of John Xavier Merriman, the last prime minister of the Cape Colony, published in 1930, the year of Laurence's death.
Benefactor.
Laurence died on 28 February 1930. By his will he endowed funds at Cambridge University for the benefit of the Cambridge University Library, to establish the Laurence Professorship of Ancient Philosophy and the Laurence Professorship of Classical Archaeology and to provide funds generally for the purposes of classical studies. He also endowed his college, Corpus Christi, with funds to support the study of classics and prizes in his name continue to be awarded.

Manuel Klein

Manuel Joachim Klein (December 6, 1876 – June 1, 1919) was an English-born composer of musical theatre and incidental music who worked primarily in New York City.
Biography.
Klein was born in London, England, to parents Herman and Adelaide (née Soman). Apparently, the elder Klein emigrated from Riga, Latvia. Once in Norwich, Hermann became a professor of foreign languages at the King Edward VI Grammar School, and Adelaide taught dance. The younger Klein's five brothers included Max, a violinist; Charles, a playwright; Herman, a music critic and music teacher; Alfred, an actor; and Philip. They had a sister, Adelaide. He was the uncle of producer Philip Klein (1888–1935). Klein was educated in London and at Tivoli House Academy, Gravesend, Kent, England.
Career.
Klein moved to the U.S. on April 11, 1896. He was the music director for David Belasco's theatre company in New York City for several years before devoting himself to composing. His first Broadway success was the musical "Mr. Pickwick", starring De Wolf Hopper. Grant Stewart wrote the lyrics, and Klein's brother Charles wrote the book. He also conducted for Charles Frohman, with whom Klein's brother, Charles, was later killed on the RMS Lusitania, among others.
Tin Pan Alley songwriter and publisher Gus Edwards helped Klein to obtain the position of musical director of the prestigious New York Hippodrome theater in 1905. Klein was soon composing songs and music for numerous spectacles presented at the Hippodrome consisting of different acts, each one with their own thematic musical concept. He collaborated with L. Frank Baum on "The Tik-Tok Man of Oz", beginning in 1909, which was finally produced in 1913 without Klein's music. He left the Hippodrome in 1915 after a disagreement with its manager, Jacob J. Shubert, over the orchestra. Shubert asked Klein to send some drums, trumpets and other instruments over to the Winter Garden Theater, where he was producing another show. Klein refused to send them, as he needed them for his own orchestra. After an argument, Klein offered his resignation and Shubert accepted it. The Hippodrome company sided with Klein, and Shubert was forced to sell his interest. Klein went back to England the same year and became music director of the Gaiety Theatre, London. He suffered a trauma at the bombing of the theatre during World War I by the Zeppelins and never fully recovered. 
Klein returned to New York and died in Yonkers, New York on June 1, 1919, as a result of the earlier trauma. After his death, the Klein family sued the German government for the loss of Manuel and his brother Charles (a victim of the sinking of the RMS Lusitania).
Family Life.
Klein married his wife, Helen (born September 16, 1884 in Cincinnati, Ohio), in approximately in 1905. They had a daughter, Marjorie, born March 28, 1909 and a son, Gerald, born March 18, 1912. Klein became a naturalized American citizen on August 9, 1910.
As of the 1930 United States Federal Census, the family had moved to Beverly Hills, California. Helen was working as a teacher, Marjorie as a stenographer for the movie industry, and Gerald as a radio repairman.
Legacy.
Although many individual songs by Klein were published, much of his incidental music remains in manuscript. Since he worked "for hire" at the Hippodrome, Charles Frohman and later R. H. Burnside retained his music manuscripts. They now form part of the Burnside collection of American theater music manuscripts in the Music Division of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.

Biełaruskaja Krajovaja Abarona

Biełaruskaja Krajovaja Abarona (Belarusian Land Defence; BKA) was the name of the armed forces of The Belarusian Central Rada from February 23, 1944 to April 28, 1945. The Belarusian Land Defence was formed under the control of Governor-General Curt von Gottberg with the help of German special services. In indispensable cases, the help of administrative governments and public organizations like SBM was used. 
On March 6, 1944, after preliminary preparation, the general mobilization of all healthy men born between 1908 and 1924 into the BKA started. About 500 to 600 men from each region (Uezd) were recruited.
On March 26, all personnel belonging to the BKA gave their oath: "I swore, that sleeve to sleeve with German soldier, I will not drop my weapon until there is peace and security in our farms and cities, until in our Motherland the last enemy of the Belarusian people will be destroyed." That day in Minsk, at 8:30 AM, in Freedom Square, Minsk, in the presence of SS and Police Leader Curt von Gottberg, the President of BCR and BKA General staff accepted this oath from cadets of the First Minsk Officer School BKA. Analyzing the mobilization, the president of Belarusian Rada Radasłaŭ Astroŭski noted, that: "Germans invoke commissions and for different payments/bribes, free people of mobilization, and because of that, accepted the solution to preserve former mistakes, not to suppose Germans". He also noted that partisans can dive in BKA, and all personal structure with Sicherheitsdienst needed inspection. 
On March 31, BKA battalions received their personal numbers. All officers from Russian, Polish, and Red armies not older than 57 years and Unteroffiziers not older than 55 years except serving in government, police, were drafted into BKA. Invoking was controlled by Police and SD commandants. The main assignment of BKA was antipartizan operations, and later at front with Red Army. Belarusian Central Government (Rada) BCR sent the BKA throughout Belarus except Pripyat river region and town Lida area; Brasław, Wołożyn, Miadzioł, Volost center Kozłowszczyzna and in Minsk region Uzda and Iwenec weren't patrolled by the BKA. 
After evacuating Rada to Königsberg, and soon to Berlin in November 1944 for updating and tutoring officers for BKA, the 1st personnel battalion BKA was formed. Battalions of BKA, on Belarusian territory, mainly were used in anti-partisan operations and later on the front with Red Army, but the BKA didn't exist after Soviets entered Belarus. The BKA retreated with the Germans to the West.
The BCR formed under occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany exists today in the US and president Radasłaŭ Astroŭski worked till 1960. Most of its members, as members of other organizations, received political asylum as immigrants. In April and May 1945, most of the BKA and SBM submitted to Russian Liberation Army surrendered to the Allies, knowing that in their motherland a long and difficult death by NKVD awaited them. Later propagandists hold that the Belarusian Liberation Armies 1st personnel battalion in Berlin in fact was a reserve for the 30th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Russian). Eleven its officers, including B. D. Rahula and others entered the 1st Grenadier Sturm Brigade SS "Belarus", formed in Nazi Germany; it was sent to the Battle of Monte Cassino, and acted against the II Corps (Poland) of General Władysław Anders (Anders Army). BKA soldiers were not trusted by the Germans, which explains why Russian Liberation Army formations weren't sent to the Eastern Front, and combat at Western Front.

I Like Killing Flies

I Like Killing Flies is a 2004 documentary film produced, directed, filmed, and edited by Matt Mahurin. It documents Shopsins restaurant in New York City's Greenwich Village and its owner and head cook, Kenny Shopsin. In 2002 and 2003, Mahurin followed Shopsin in his final year at the location he ran for over 30 years. Throughout the film, Shopsin offers what he calls "half-baked" philosophy, peppered with profanities.
In the first half, Shopsin opens his eatery for the day and talks about his kitchen, his business, his employees, and his customers. We meet the regulars and friends who eat some of the 900 eclectic dishes he prepares, and we learn the rules of the restaurant: all customers must eat, parties of five or more are unwelcome, and anyone who irritates the owner will be swiftly shown the door. Shopsin's wife and children, all of whom work at the restaurant, weigh in on what it's like to work for this eccentric and occasionally hot-tempered man.
In the film's second half, Shopsin loses his lease and is forced to move his establishment to a larger location on nearby Carmine Street. Family, friends, and customers all pitch in to help with the move. Everything must go, from hundreds of knick-knacks and supplies to an alarmingly rickety stove. The reopening is a resounding success. The epilogue grants the audience one last glimpse of Shopsin's life the following year, and it is revealed that Shopsin's wife has died, but he seems not to have changed at all.
Shopsin, who has been profiled in "The New Yorker" by Calvin Trillin, wrote a 2008 book with Carolynn Carreño entitled "Eat Me: The Food and Philosophy of Kenny Shopsin".

Woodrow Wilson Foundation

The Woodrow Wilson Foundation was an educational non-profit created in 1922, organized under the laws of New York, for the "perpetuation of Wilson's ideals" through publications and support of research. Franklin D. Roosevelt was the national chairman, and there were local chairmen in each of the 48 states. The initial goal of the foundation was 1 million dollars. Among the foundation’s goals was the establishment of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award for distinguished public service.
In 1963, the Foundation undertook the financial responsibility for the completion of "The Papers of Woodrow Wilson", a 69 volume edition of all of Wilson's papers, which was jointly sponsored by Princeton University. Princeton housed Wilson’s papers and provided the staff for the project. The first volume was published in 1966 and the final volume in 1994. This project consumed all of the energies and funds of the foundation during its thirty year duration. Following the publication of the final volume, the foundation intended to return to its support of research, but the drain of funds had been too great, and the foundation folded in 1993. Various functions of the foundation were turned over to Princeton University.
Award recipients.
The foundation established the Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award for "distinguished public service". Later, in 1947, an award was created for the "best book on government, politics, or international affairs." It is awarded by the American Political Science Association (APSA).

In some years two books were recognized as co-recipients. Winning authors and their books include:

Holtzer-Cabot

Holtzer-Cabot was a Boston, MA company founded in 1875. They specialized in small motors, fire alarm systems, telegraph-related products, and various other electric devices. The company closed in 1972.
History.
Charles Holzter founded the company as "Holtzer Co." and began manufacturing simple electrical devices such as doorbells and electric igniters. In 1880, Seth W. Fuller partnered with Holzter, and the company became known as "Seth W. Fuller & Holtzer", and later as "Fuller, Holtzer & Company". George E. Cabot joined the business, and Fuller left in 1889. The company then changed its name to "Holtzer-Cabot", which remained their name until their closing. In 1891, the company built an electric car that sat four people and moved approximately 16 MPH. It was the first to feature a steering wheel, and is known as the first successful electric vehicle in America, though other unsuccessful prototypes had been built before. Around the turn of the 20th century, the company branched out to create various telephone/telegraph-related products, clocks, and fire alarm systems. They invented the first shunt-type fire alarm system, where a local alarm pulled in a building would also trigger the nearest municipal street fire alarm box. Most of their fire alarm systems were installed in hospitals, factories, and institutions. In 1927, Charles Holtzer died. Throughout World War II, the company branched out even more, but struggled to retain business. In 1972, the company officially closed its doors, and sold the remainder of their lines to Eastern Air Devices based in Dover NH (Now known as Electrocraft). The original factory in Jamaica Plain, MA still exists, but has now been converted to an apartment complex.

The students go by the name of the Pottstown Trojans and the school mascot is a Trojan. The school colors are blue and white.
Music program.
The Pottstown Senior High has a music program. A band marches in Walt Disney parades every other year located in Florida, while the chorus goes down to Florida in the other years. There is a bell choir, mixed ensemble choir, show choir, flute and clarinet ensembles for band, a jazz band, and a concert band.
Senior Project.
To graduate from the school a senior must fulfill a Senior project, sometimes known as a Graduation project. This project must be completed and presented in front of a panel of three teachers in order for a person to graduate. The planning for the Senior project begins in the sophomore year of high school, 10th grade. If a person doesn't turn their requirements in on time, they become ineligible for all activities and sports within the school.
Some things that are included in the project are: Proposal, Service Contract, at least 45 hours of community/volunteer service on the project (not during school hours), Journals, and a Reflection Paper.

Building and other facilities.
In front of the entrance to the Pottstown Senior High School, to the side where the soccer and baseball fields are, is an area called the Square. Running the square is good exercise, and sometimes used during physical education. The Square goes down from the main entrance of the school, down North Franklin towards the middle school, and then turn north, still on the sidewalk, and then it runs along the side of the high school making it a square.

Max d'Ollone

Maximilien-Paul-Marie-Félix d'Ollone was a French composer, who was born on 13 June 1875 at Besançon and died in Paris in 1959.
He started composing very early, entering the Paris Conservatoire at 6, winning many prizes, receiving the encouragement of Gounod, Saint-Saëns, Massenet, Thomas and Delibes. His teachers at the Conservatoire were Lavignac, Massenet, Gédalge and Lenepveu; he won the Prix de Rome in 1897.
He was director of music in Angers, professor at the Paris Conservatoire and director of the Opéra-Comique. In 1932 he wrote three important articles for "Le Ménestrel" (29 July, 9 & 16 December) arguing for a more populist approach to composition.
In addition to the works listed below, d'Ollone produced a number of song cycles (including "Les Chants d'Ailleurs"; " Les Chants d'Exil"; "Impressions d'Automne"), which demonstrate a considerable mastery of the French mélodie. There are several works for orchestra, solo instrument and orchestra, and piano works.

BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award

The BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award is the titular award of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony, which takes place each December. The winner is the sportsperson, judged by a public vote, to have achieved the most that year. The recipient must either be British or reside and play a significant amount of their sport in the United Kingdom. The winner is selected by a public-vote from a pre-determinted shortlist.
Sports Personality of the Year was created by Paul Fox, who thought of the idea while he was editor of the magazine show "Sportsview". The first award ceremony took place in 1954 as part of "Sportsview", and was presented by Peter Dimmock. For the first show, votes were sent by postcard, and rules presented in a "Radio Times" article stipulated that nominations were restricted to athletes who had featured on the "Sportsview" programme since April. Approximately 14,500 votes were cast, and Christopher Chataway beat Roger Bannister to win the inaugural BBC Sportsperson of the Year Award. Since then, numerous other awards have been introduced to the ceremony, which now consists of eight awards.
Three people have won the award multiple times: boxer Henry Cooper and the Formula One drivers Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill have each won twice. Snooker player Steve Davis has finished in the top three a record five times. HRH The Princess Anne (1971) and her daughter Zara Phillips (2006) are the only pair of award-winners to be members of the same family. The oldest recipient of the award is Dai Rees, who won in 1957 aged 44. Ian Black, who won the following year, aged 17, is the youngest winner. Out of the fifty-seven recipients, thirteen have been female. Sixteen sporting disciplines have been represented; athletics has the highest representation, with seventeen recipients.
Torvill and Dean, who won in 1984, are the only non-individual winners of the award. Counting them separately, there have been forty-five English winners of the award, five Scottish, four Welsh, three Irish, and one Manx. The most recent award was made in 2013 to tennis player Andy Murray.
Nomination procedure.
The shortlist is announced at the beginning of December, and the winner is determined on the night of the ceremony by a public telephone vote. Prior to 2012, a panel of thirty sports journalists each submit a list of ten contenders. From these contenders a shortlist of ten nominees was determined—currently, in the event of a tie at the end of the nomination process, a panel of six former award winners determines the nominee by a Borda count. However, this method was criticized following the selection of an all-male shortlist in 2011. The selection process for contenders has been changed for the 2012 (and future) awards as follows:
The BBC introduced an expert panel. The panel will be asked to devise a shortlist that reflects UK sporting achievements on the national and/or international stage, represents the breadth and depth of UK sports and takes into account ‘impact’ within and beyond the sport or sporting achievement in question.
The 2012 panel comprised:

Carmen Espinoza-Rodriquez (born July 16, 1970 in Muleshoe, Texas) is an American singer-songwriter. Carmen attended Texas Tech in Lubbock and West Texas A&M University in Canyon and received her degree in the study of Montessori Education in 1997.
Biography.
She is one of ten children of Camilo Espinoza, Jr., and Maria Guadalupe Orozco Espinoza. Her first performance was at the age of six with her father, who performed with Bob Wills, Marlon Brando, and The Lennon Sisters. Her love for music and stage grew. In high school, she received the Louis Armstrong Jazz Award for vocals. 
Soon after, she was asked to be the lead vocalist for Hacienda Records artist, Algo Simple. After a twelve year span with Algo Simple, she decided to go solo. It was at this turning point when she was recommended by CMA Award winning singer-songwriter Susan Gibson (writer "Wide Open Spaces") to appear on a PBS video documentary. Inspired, she recorded an original composition and shot a video entitled "America" that has since been featured in two PBS documentaries; "Celebrate America!" and "Southwest Expressions". Past members of her band include Robin Brannon from the Christian vocal group Acappella (group). Carmen was invited to record and perform as a special guest with the WTAMU Jazz Ensemble. During this time, she was approached to go on tour with Texas X-press, an outreach touring troupe for the outdoor musical drama Texas Legacies. It was during the tour that she was asked by the executive producer of "Texas Legacies" to take on the lead role (and was the first minority to be offered a lead role) as Maria Hinojosa' in "Texas Legacies". Carmen accepted the role for the 2003 season. Since then, she has shared the stage with country artists including Lee Roy Van Dyke, Steve Wariner, Restless Heart, Holly Dunn, and Michael Martin Murphey.

HMS Hesper (1809)

HMS "Hesper" was a Royal Navy 18-gun ship-sloop of the "Cormorant" class, launched in 1809 at Dartmouth. Her original builder, Benjamin Tanner, became bankrupt during her construction, so John Cock completed her. In 1810 she was reclassed as a 20-gun sixth rate ship (but without being re-armed); in 1817 she was again re-rated, this time as 26 guns. She served primarily in the Indian Ocean. In 1810 she participated in the Invasion of Isle de France. The next year "Hesper" participated in the capture of Java, which she followed in 1812 by capturing Timor. She was sold in 1817.
Service.
G. Aklom apparently commissioned "Hesper" in March 1807. However, "Hesper" was not launched until 1809 and did not actually enter service until 1809. Captain George Hoare was appointed to "Hesper" in 1809, commissioned her in August and sailed for the Indian Ocean on 9 October. In October 1810 Commander David Paterson took command. 
"Hesper" was detailed for service with the squadron under Admiral Albemarle Bertie engaged in the invasion of Isle de France (Mauritius). Bertie set "Hesper" and to join the squadron blockading Port Louis. While she was there, she and the government armed ship "Emma", Lieutenant B. Street commanding, performed a useful reconnaissance taking soundings at night of the anchorage on the coast, a service for which Bertie commended them. They identified a place in a narrow strait between an islet called the Gunner's Coin and the coast where the fleet could anchor and where boats could land through an opening in the reef. The island surrendered on 3 December. In September 1814 prize money was paid to the officers and crews of the vessels that had been present at the capture of Isle de France.
Following the successful invasion, "Hesper" was at the centre of a dispute between Admiral Bertie and Admiral William O'Bryen Drury whose commands overlapped. Bertie appointed Lieutenant Edward Lloyd to command "Hesper" and he sailed her back to Bombay with Major-General John Abercrombie and his staff as passengers. There Lloyd found out that Drury had appointed Barrington Reynolds to command her. Although Drury died before the dispute was settled, Reynolds was confirmed in command. 
On 5 January 1811, "Hesper" was one of six ships that shared in the capture of the "Mouche". Later in 1811, "Hesper" was attached to the squadron of Admiral Robert Stopford that captured Java. 
On 31 August the frigates "Nisus", "President", and "Phoebe", and "Hesper" were detached to take the seaport of Cheribon. Reynolds received a promotion to Post-captain, confirmed the next year, for his role. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp "Java" to all remaining survivors of the campaign.
In February 1812 command passed to Charles Thomas Thurston, who was blown by a storm to Timor, which had been out on contact with Europe for two years. Thurston was able to persuade the Dutch garrison there to surrender and captured the island without fighting. Thurston was later invalided home. Lieutenant Henry Theodosius Browne Collier took command on 30 June 1812, but he too was invalided home before the confirmation of his promotion to Commander on 24 October 1812. Command then passed to Commander Joseph Prior. As a lieutenant he had transferred to "Hesper" in 1809.
In October "Hesper" was in the Persian Gulf, delivering despatches to Bushire for the British ambassador at Teheran. She then visited Abu Dhabi. Captain Charles Biddulph replaced Prior in August 1812 and served until 22 April 1815 when he died. Before he died 22 May 1815, aged 29, he charted the four Biddulph's Islands (or Biddulph Group), which lie on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf.
"Hesper" was without a captain for a while and then on 20 September 1815 Michael Matthews was made Commander on "Hesper". Commander Robert Campbell (acting) was his replacement.
Fate.
"Hesper" was sold in 1817.

Josephine Roche

Josephine Aspinwall Roche (December 2, 1886 - July 1976) was a Colorado humanitarian, industrialist, activist, and politician. She was born in Neligh, Nebraska, and raised in Omaha, attending private girls' schools there before matriculating at Vassar College in 1904. There she double-majored in economics and classics, and participated in basketball and track clubs. After graduating in 1908, Roche earned a Masters Degree in social work in 1910 from Columbia University.
In 1906 her parents, John and Ella Roche, moved to Denver, where much of her life's work would be centered. Roche volunteered for social causes in both New York City and Denver, studied cost of living issues, and in 1912 returned to Denver full-time to become that city's first female police officer. However, her tenure there was short-lived, as her zealous prosecution of sumptuary laws and prostitution caused the city's more lenient law enforcement community to force her resignation.
Over the following decade, Roche held a number of jobs in Denver and Washington, D.C., including serving as chair of the Colorado Progressive Party and campaigning against child labor in the sugar beet industry. While in Washington, she was briefly married to author Edward Hale Bierstadt, a colleague at the Foreign Language Information Service, of which she was the director; the marriage lasted from 1920 to 1922 and ended in divorce. In 1925, she returned to Colorado due to her father's failing health, and in 1927 inherited his holdings in the Rocky Mountain Fuel Company, a coal mining company which he had founded. By 1929, she had purchased a majority interest in the company and become president. She then proceeded to enact a variety of pro-labor policies, including an invitation for the United Mine Workers of America to return to Colorado and unionize her mines, 15 years after her father and other coal mine owners had broken the unions in the aftermath of the Ludlow Massacre of 1914.
Roche left Rocky Mountain Fuel in 1934 to run for Governor of Colorado. After being defeated in the Democratic Party primary by Edwin C. Johnson, president Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed her as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. She held that post from 1934 until 1937, when she resigned to return to Colorado and run Rocky Mountain Fuel following the death of its president. However, the company was too much impacted by a variety of economic forces, and declared bankruptcy in 1944.
Beginning in 1948, Roche served as one of three directors of the United Mine Workers' welfare and retirement fund. In 1968, the union and its leadership were sued for mismanagement of the fund. The mismanagement charge was eventually proven in court, forcing Roche to step down in 1971.
Over the course of her life, Roche was honored by a number of business and civic organizations, and received honorary degrees from Smith College, Oglethorpe University, Mount Holyoke College, and the University of Colorado.

Crooked House (TV series)

Crooked House is a supernatural drama mini-series which aired on BBC Four in December 2008.
The three-part series was broadcast on consecutive nights from 22 to 24 December 2008. It was written and co-produced by actor and writer Mark Gatiss, who found fame in the BBC series "The League of Gentlemen". The three linked episodes form an anthology story, influenced by the writings of M. R. James and Amicus horror movies, and a Māori death-mask belonging to Gatiss. They concern the ghostly secrets of fictional Geap Manor, a recently demolished Tudor mansion.
The first story, "The Wainscoting", is set in the late 18th century. Gatiss plays a museum curator who is given a strange door-knocker, which inspires him to share his dark researches into the Manor. The first tale related the story of Joseph Bloxham, who buys and improves the Manor after capitalising on an investment which ruined his fellow speculators. Strange noises are heard behind the newly installed wainscoting, the wood of which came from the gallows known as 'Tyburn Tree'.
The second story, "Something Old", takes place in the 1920s, where, at the Manor, a lavish costume ball is being held. During the ball young Felix de Momery announces his engagement to Ruth, much to the surprise and annoyance of his grandmother and his friends, Billy and Katherine. The young couple's future seems to be inextricably linked with another tragic wedding day and a ghostly bride who haunts the corridors. 
In the third episode, "The Knocker", Ben himself discovers that, even though demolished, Geap Manor continues to cast a long shadow. Recently split from his girlfriend, he finds the cosy blandness of his modern house suddenly altered by events from the distant past, and by the sinister figure of Sir Roger Widdowson. 
The cast included Mark Gatiss, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Ian Hallard, Philip Jackson, Lee Ingleby, Jean Marsh, Samuel Barnett, Daniela Denby-Ashe, Anna Madeley, Andy Nyman and illusionist Derren Brown. The series was directed by Damon Thomas.

Sidon sequence

In number theory, a Sidon sequence (or Sidon set), named after the Hungarian mathematician Simon Sidon, is a sequence "A" = {"a"0, "a"1, "a"2, ...} of natural numbers in which all pairwise sums "a""i" + "a""j" ("i" ≤ "j") are different. Sidon introduced the concept in his investigations of Fourier series.
The main problem in the study of Sidon sequences, posed by Sidon, is to find the largest number of elements a Sidon sequence "A" can have smaller than some given number "x". Despite a large body of research, the question remained unsolved for almost 80 years. In 2010, it was finally settled by J. Cilleruelo, I. Ruzsa and C. Vinuesa.
Early results.
Paul Erdős and Pál Turán proved that, for every "x" > 0, the number of elements smaller than "x" in a Sidon sequence is at most formula_1. Using a construction of J. Singer, they showed that there exist Sidon sequences that contain formula_2 terms less than "x".
Infinite Sidon sequences.
Erdős also showed that if we consider any particular infinite Sidon sequence "A" and let "A"("x") denote the number of its elements up to "x", then
That is, infinite Sidon sequences are thinner than the densest finite Sidon sequences.
For the other direction, Chowla and Mian observed that the greedy algorithm gives an infinite Sidon sequence with formula_4 for every "x". Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi improved this with a construction of a Sidon sequence with
The best lower bound to date was given by Imre Z. Ruzsa, who proved that a Sidon sequence with
exists. Erdős conjectured that an infinite Sidon set "A" exists for which formula_7 holds. He and Rényi showed the existence of a sequence {"a"0,"a"1...} with the conjectural density but satisfying only the weaker property that there is a constant "k" such that for every natural number "n" there are at most "k" solutions of the equation "a""i" + "a""j" = "n". (To be a Sidon sequence would require that "k" = 1.)
Erdős further conjectured that there exists a nonconstant integer-coefficient polynomial whose values at the natural numbers form a Sidon sequence. Specifically, he asked if the set of fifth powers is a Sidon set. Ruzsa came close to this by showing that there is a real number "c" with 0 < "c" < 1 such that the range of the function 
"f"("x") = "x"5 + ["cx"4] is a Sidon sequence, where [.] denotes integer part. As "c" is irrational, this function "f"("x") is not a polynomial. The statement that the set of fifth powers is a Sidon set is a special case of the later conjecture of Lander, Parkin and Selfridge.
Relationship to Golomb rulers.
All finite Sidon sets are Golomb rulers, and vice-versa.
To see this, suppose for a contradiction that "S" is a Sidon set and not a Golomb ruler. Since it is not a Golomb ruler, there must be four members such that formula_8. It follows that formula_9, which contradicts the proposition that "S" is a Sidon set. Therefore all Sidon sets must be Golomb rulers. By a similar argument, all Golomb rulers must be Sidon sets.

Francois Thibaut

François Thibaut (born January 3, 1948) is an educator known for developing the "Thibaut Technique" second language acquisition method for children and is the Founder/Director of "The Language Workshop for Children" (“LWFC”) nationwide educational centers based in New York City. Thibaut’s technique is the basis of the curriculum offered at LWFC programs and in the Professor Toto children’s language education animation. The LWFC begins teaching languages to children at the age of six months, when they’re preverbal.
Childhood Observations, The Basis of the Thibaut Technique.
At the age of six Thibaut was enrolled at the College Saint Barbe boarding school in Paris where teachers made no effort to translate or explain the meaning of the French language curriculum in which newly enrolled, non-French speaking students would be immersed. Instead after six weeks absorbing French in a context-rich language immersion classroom, the non-French elementary age children would begin speaking single French words. By week eight they would use two and then three word sentences, and by 2½ months they could construct complete, accent-free French sentences, correctly attribute noun genders, and use past, present, and future tenses. Thibaut observed an example of what neurolinguist Eric Lenneberg later identified as a critical period language development in his Biological Foundations of Language (1967). Young Thibaut’s observations led him to make language immersion, emotionally stimulating and context-rich activities, and no-translation central to the LWFC’s classes and his Thibaut Technique method.
Early Teaching Experience.
Thibaut emigrated to New York in 1973, when foreign language instruction was focused on high school and college students. As a teacher he was frustrated by watching his college-age students struggle to acquire the same French grammar, pronunciation, and vocabulary lessons week after week through traditional translation and grammar drill methods. So he switched his teaching focus to children, abandoned translation-drill methods, and adopted the context-rich, language acquisition devices that he had observed at his elementary school, adding play, color, and humor.

Northumberland Development Project

The Northumberland Development Project is a project to build a football stadium which will replace White Hart Lane as the home stadium of Tottenham Hotspur. The stadium is intended to have a capacity of 56,250 spectators. The development plans were also drafted to include 200 homes, a 150-room hotel, a supermarket and a public square for community events such as ice skating or street markets. However recently the plan for a 150-room hotel has been rebuffed. After an extended period of consultation with the local community, negotiations with Haringey Council and the Mayor of London, planning permissions were issued on 20 September 2011.
Background.
The club stated in 2007 that it was considering options for increasing stadium capacity involving redevelopment of the current site or a move to a new site. It advised in the 2007/8 Interim Financial Statement that the preferred option would be announced in the first half of 2008, but later delayed this decision until the autumn of 2008. The Club had also considered a move to a new site. One possibility for the club was to use the Olympic Stadium after the London 2012 Olympics. As this would have involved a move out of the Tottenham area and because the stadium was required to retain a running track the Club advised the plan was dropped.
In November 2007 Tony Winterbottom, formerly of the London Development Agency, who had worked on development of Arsenal's Emirates Stadium, was reported as leading the development of the options for the new stadium.
In April 2008 it was revealed in the press that investigations were taking place into the possible use of the adjacent Wingate industrial estate. If planning permission and the agreement of the current businesses there was granted, a 55–60,000-seat stadium could be constructed on the current White Hart Lane site.
In December 2008, the design for the new stadium, by KSS Design Group and Buro Happold was revealed. A projected completion date was first announced in October 2009, when Spurs' chairman Daniel Levy stated that Spurs intend to move into the partially built new stadium for the start of the 2012–13 season, with the final 56,250-seat venue ready for the following campaign. However, subsequent delays have put the completion date back to at least 2016.
Middle Eastern Company Qatar Investment Authority have been linked with purchasing naming rights of the stadium when complete.
Development project plans.
The Northumberland Development Project covers an area of around , bordered by Park Lane to the South, Worcester Avenue to the East, Northumberland Park to the North and the High Road to the West. The stadium will be built alongside the existing White Hart Lane. and will be designed in such a way that the crowd will be close to the pitch in order to maximise the atmosphere inside the ground. It will feature a single-tier stand, similar to the Kop at Liverpool's Anfield ground. 
Tottenham Hotspur had originally planned to move into the new stadium, whilst it is partially built, for the beginning of the 2012–13 season, and the stadium would be completed by the end of the following season. Delays due to the need to submit revised plans and seek funding have delayed the project. September 2012 saw the start of the project with work on the site where a Sainsburys supermarket will be located. The estimated completion date of the whole project is now anticipated for 2016.
Spurs have not released the projected cost of the stadium, although it is estimated at around £400 million. Instead of maintaining the White Hart Lane name, the club plans to pursue corporate sponsorship of the stadium . with Spurs eyeing potential suitors in the UAE.
As of May 2013 the plans comprise:
(Plans for a 150 bedroom hotel with restaurant and skyline bar were dropped in 2012 in favour of increased commercial premises, homes and educational facilities).
The Club, which is a founding participant of the environmental campaign has summarised the energy saving measures and other environmentally friendly elements of the project which it claims will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by around 40% compared to current Building Regulation requirements and make it one of the most environmentally sustainable stadia in the United Kingdom.
Project funding.
On 21 August 2009 Tottenham Hotspur made a Stock Exchange announcement that it was issuing 30 million new shares aimed at raising £15 million to fund the first stage of the proposed development. The funds specifically relate to the professional costs required to advance the project to the point where a full planning application can be submitted. The club's major shareholder, ENIC International Ltd subscribed to take up 27.8 million of the shares. The club have also bid for an investment from the Regional Growth Fund (RGF). A decision is still awaited.
On 22 July 2011, supporter group Supporting Our Future submitted a proposal for a £50 million funding initiative to Spurs to support the Northumberland Development Project by way of a Community Share scheme. This proposal was presented after polling Spurs fans on their views of the club and Northumberland Park Development, and extensive consultation with the club, Haringey Council, and Supporters Direct.
Application for planning permission.
The club originally submitted a planning application for the stadium to Haringey Council in October 2009, with a view to starting construction in 2010. However, following criticism by English Heritage, and the Government’s advisory body on architecture, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, and other conservation groups about the proposed demolition of listed buildings, in May 2010 the club withdrew its planning application in favour of a revised plan, which retained the listed buildings, reduced the number of new-build residential houses and improved the public spaces. On 30 September the Planning Committee of Haringey Council unanimously approved the revised planning application. Daniel Levy, Tottenham chairman said:- 
The Mayor of London gave his approval to the plans to redevelop the stadium on 25 November 2010. The club confirmed, on 9 December 2010, that the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs had written to confirm that she did not propose to call in the planning application and that English Heritage would not be seeking further consideration of the listed building consent application for the Northumberland Development Project, the club concluded the Section 106 agreement with Haringey Council and planning permission was granted on 20 September 2011. 
Following the riots in the Tottenham area other parts of London and elsewhere in England in August 2011 the Greater London Authority and Haringey Council announced on 28 September that it would relieve the club of all community infrastructure payments that planners would normally require, estimated at £8.5m, and to provide a further £8.5m for regeneration and infrastructure projects. As part of the agreement an additional £9m was also committed by the London Borough of Haringey to improve services for residents in the area.
Olympic Stadium site.
On 1 October 2010 Daniel Levy confirmed in a press statement issued following planning approval of the Northumberland Development plan the previous day that the club had also registered an interest in the Olympic Stadium site in conjunction with AEG (Europe) as the deadline for declaring interest was on 30 September 2010. The Chairman explained that:-
On 12 November 2010 the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) announced that together with West Ham United, the Tottenham Hotspur/AEG consortium were the preferred bidders to take over the Olympic stadium after the 2012 Olympics. The OPLC advised that negotiations would proceed with both bidders and the winning bid would be confirmed in March 2011. On 13 January 2011, David Lammy, the Member of Parliament for Tottenham threatened to take legal action against the use of name 'Tottenham' if the club went ahead with a move out of Tottenham. The OPLC announced on 11 February 2011 that West Ham had been selected as the preferred bidder for the Olympic Stadium, subject to the decision being ratified by Government departments and the Mayor of London. In a statement Tottenham Hotspur advised that as the deal was not yet concluded the club would continue to "monitor the situation". Spurs then applied for a judicial review to overturn the OPLC's decision, however this appeal was rejected in June 2011
The Olympic Legacy Company announced on 5 July 2011 that an independent review into the awarding of the Olympic Park Stadium to West Ham F.C. was to be carried out on its behalf by auditors Moore Stephens. This was a consequence of the discovery on 30 June 2011 that an employee of the Legacy Company, Dionne Knight, had been engaged by West Ham to carry out consultancy work relating to the Olympic Stadium without permission of the OPLC. The OPLC announced that Ms Knight had been suspended whilst a possible conflict of interest was investigated. It also became known that Ms Knight had already declared to the OPLC that she was in a personal relationship with a director of the football club. Meanwhile, Tottenham Hotspur announced it was seeking a judicial review of the decision to award the stadium to West Ham after the Olympics.
On 24 August 2011, Tottenham and Leyton Orient won a review of the decision, being told that they had an arguable case. The review was due to take place on 18 October 2011. However, on 11 October 2011 the deal to sell the stadium to West Ham collapsed. On 17 October 2011 it was announced by the government that Tottenham Hotspur (and Leyton Orient F.C.) had withdrawn legal action seeking a judicial review into the handing of the Olympic Stadium to West Ham.

Mob Wars

Mob Wars is a multiplayer role-playing game hosted on the social networking site Facebook. It allows players to engage in Mafia-style wars with one another and has become one of the most lucrative Facebook applications and the first to net USD 1M per month in revenue.
However, this number has never been confirmed by the developer or any third parties.
Developed by David Maestri while he worked for Freewebs.com, it was subsequently the subject of an unsuccessful intellectual property lawsuit as Maestri's former employers attempted to claim ownership over the asset.
The lawsuit was ultimately settled in December 2008 with the IP for "Mob Wars" remaining with Maestri but with SGN allowed to develop their own Mafia based role-playing application.
In August 2008, Mob Wars had 2.5 million active users.
It has spawned several very similar games with nearly identical gameplay and format on both Facebook and MySpace, some of which, such as Zynga's Mafia Wars, were the subject of further lawsuits. Zynga made some changes to "Mafia Wars" so it wouldn't resemble "Mob Wars" as closely, but Mob Wars creator David Maestri moved forward with his lawsuit. In September 2009, Maestri and Zynga settled the case for about $7–$9 million, less than the $10 million Maestri had originally demanded.
In 2009 the developers of Mob Wars created a spin-off game called "Mob Wars: La Cosa Nostra", which follows a similar format, but awards skill points at a much faster pace than the original game.
Gameplay.
"Mob Wars" is a simple role-playing game. There is no world for the player to move around in. The only type of character interaction the player experiences with other players, is either by sending them messages, weapons, and energy boosts, or attacking them. Like many Facebook applications, most of the gameplay revolves around having friends of the player join the player's mob through means made possible in the game.
The player starts off as a petty thief and works their way up to doing bigger and better paying "jobs" and "heists". The player gains strength by equipping his mob with weapons, armor and vehicles. These can be "drops" from doing "jobs" and "heists", gifts from friends, or they can be purchased with game money (earned by doing jobs, fighting other players, or as income from investments in properties.)
Favor Points (sub-currency also known as "Godfather points") can be used to heal or gain more game money. They are slowly earned as you level up or can be gained quickly by participating in sponsor surveys or off site membership purchases with a credit card.
Soon after the development of the game alliances were formed by many players, to promote levelling and to organize group attacks, and to protect against those same tactics. Some families were more organized than others and these alliances would range from only a few players to hundreds. Eventually the game itself evolved to promote the family aspect of the game, giving each players character the option of either staying on their own, creating their own family or joining another family. If the respective character is a member of an in-game family, they would be "tagged" with the family name, which would link to the family page, listing all of the mobsters in that respective family. Many of the original families created in-game family alternatives, but since they were limited to 50 members per family the groups lost many members to other newcomers. In 2012 the Family aspect of the game was improved to include a Win-Loss percentage in "Wars".

Seasons for Fasting

The title (The) Seasons for Fasting refers to an incomplete Old English homiletic poem, which deals primarily with the observance of fasts on the appropriate dates of the liturgical calendar, but which also attacks the misbehaviour of lax priests. The piece appears to have been composed by a clergyman and directed at a lay audience, addressed as "folces manna" in line 212, whom he perhaps believed to have been potentially misguided.
Witnesses.
The original manuscript, MS Otho B XI, was largely destroyed in the Cotton fire of 1731 and "Seasons for Fasting" was among the losses. Fortunately, the antiquarian Laurence Nowell had made a transcript in 1562, which was recovered by Robin Flower in 1934 and which is now contained in MS Add. 43703 (London, British Library). Moreover, eight lines of the poem were transcribed by Abraham Whelock. Nowell's transcript has the poem on ff. 257-60v, where it breaks off suddenly, and continues on ff. 261r-64v with Old English remedies and leechdoms and on f. 265-67 with a further transcription of the Laws of Æthelstan. When Humfrey Wanley inspected the manuscript in 1705 for his catalogue, the poem had become the last item.

Halloween Massacre (Angola)

The Halloween Massacre (also known as the Three Day War) refers to events which took place from October 30 to November 1, 1992 in Luanda, Angola as part of the Angolan Civil War. 
Context.
The Halloween Massacre took place following the 1992 presidential and legislative elections, which were the first in the country's history. The government party, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), claimed victory in these elections. The opposition movement turned political party, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), questioned the fairness of the election. Because neither the MPLA nor UNITA obtained the required absolute majority of the presidential election, a follow-up election was necessary according to the constitution.
Events.
As both sides heightened war rhetoric, the MPLA attacked UNITA positions in Luanda. Fighting ensued, leading to the deaths of many prominent UNITA officials, including Jeremias Chitunda, Elias Salupeto Pena and Aliceres Mango, who were pulled from their vehicle and shot dead. Thousands of UNITA and National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) voters were massacred nationwide by MPLA forces over three days.
Results.
Over 10,000 UNITA and FNLA voters were killed by MPLA forces, mostly of the Ovimbundu and Bakongo ethnic groups. Other estimates, based on church figures, estimate 25,000 to 40,000 UNITA and FNLA supporters were killed.

Ladora Savings Bank

The Ladora Savings Bank is a historic structure along U.S. Route 6 in Ladora, Iowa, United States. Constructed in 1920, it was closed when the bank that built it failed in the Great Depression, leaving it to be used by a succession of businesses. Today, it is occupied by a restaurant, the Ladora Bank Bistro. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since August 3, 1990.
Structure.
Designed by William Lightner and Charles B. Zalesky, the masonry Neoclassically-styled building included two substantial Doric columns in its facade and several tall windows on the sides. The structure originally included restrooms (including an outside exit for women to use discreetly), which were an unusual feature; at its opening, the bank promoted these restrooms to its customers. Among its interior features visible to the public were marble counters, wooden floors, and paintings on the wall, while massive vaults were built to protect valuables; recent renovations have restored these features, most of which still remain.
History.
The Ladora Savings Bank building was dedicated on July 26, 1920. The bank survived the tumultuous economic times of the 1920s, but it could not withstand the Great Depression, which led to its closure on July 27, 1931. The building remained a center of life in Ladora: during various times in its history, it served as a community center, housing a Red Cross office during World War II and a civil defense shelter during the Cold War; it was also a polling place for many years. It was also a commercial building at certain points in its history, housing at various times an insurance salesman's office, an attorney's office, an antique shop, and a rest area for truck drivers traveling along U.S. 6. During this period, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places, being included primarily for its architecture.
Reopening.
After some years of inactivity, the bank building was purchased in October 2004 by businessman Brad Erickson, who also owns properties around the bank. With his fiancée Colleen Klainert, Erickson proceeded to renovate the building: the couple replaced the roof, redesigned the interior, and gradually restored the interior to an appearance similar to that of a bank from the 1920s. Hoping to open a restaurant in the building, they refurbished several major side rooms: as the celebrated original restrooms no longer functioned, they were turned into museum rooms, while the bank's substantial vault became a lounge. They opened their new restaurant on May 15, 2008.

A legislatively referred constitutional amendment is a constitutional amendment that appears on a state's ballot as a ballot measure because the state legislature in that state voted to put it before the voters. 
A legislatively referred constitutional amendment is a limited form of direct democracy with comparison to the initiated constitutional amendment. With the initiated constitutional amendment, voters are in charge of the process from beginning to end, whereas with the legislatively referred amendment, they can only approve or reject amendments which their legislature votes to place before them.

<doc id="20824119" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20824119" title="Ballot title">
Ballot title

A ballot title is the official, short, summary of a ballot measure that appears on the ballot. The goal of a good ballot title is to be a neutral summary that accurately conveys to voters the gist of what the proposed new law says or would do. The National Conference of State Legislatures says, "The ballot title and summary are arguably the most important part of an initiative in terms of voter education. Most voters never read more than the title and summary of the text of initiative proposals. Therefore, it is of critical importance that titles and summaries be concise, accurate and impartial."
However, it is not always clear how one would neutrally describe the gist of what a new law would do.
As a result, ballot titles are fertile grounds for conflict and lawsuits.
Differences between states.
One way that states differ in laws governing the initiative process has to do with whether the ballot title is determined "before" signatures are collected, or "after".
Another way that states differ has to do with whether the ballot title is determined by the government (which could be a commission, a ballot title determination board, the Secretary of State, or some other election official) or whether the ballot title is determined by the political organization that is advocating for the measure.
Pre-circulation ballot titles.
States where the ballot title is set prior to circulation include:
Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon (In Oregon, the ballot title is set after 1,000 initial sponsorship signatures have been submitted) and Washington.
Post-circulation ballot titles.
States where the ballot title is determined by the government "after" the signatures have been collected are:
Arizona, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, Utah, Wyoming.
Ballot titles determined by proponents.
In Florida and South Dakota, the ballot title is determined by the proponent, subject to legal challenge by opponents in court.
Impact of ballot title on election outcome.
There is a general consensus that the ballot title can be highly determinative of whether a ballot measure wins or loses.

<doc id="20824136" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20824136" title="List of regions in Faerûn">
List of regions in Faerûn

This is a list of fictional regions, geographical features, and other locations on the continent of Faerûn from the "Forgotten Realms" setting. These locations have appeared in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for the "Dungeons and Dragons" fantasy role-playing game, the multiple series of novels set in the Forgotten Realms, or the numerous video games set in the Forgotten Realms, or any combination thereof.
Also note that there are separate lists for cities and nations of the "Forgotten Realms" setting.
A.
Anauroch.
Anauroch, also called "The Great Sand Sea", is a magical desert on the continent of Faerûn.
The desert is a remnant of the once-powerful Netheril Empire. It is presently inhabited by the Bedines, magically transported there from Zakhara as well as the vicious asabi and the dreaded phaerimms and, since very recently, by the archwizards of Shade.
Elminster has said of Anauroch that "It is not a natural desert, and it is not all hot sands."
In fact it is three deserts. The hot, dry desert of sand dunes which most folk imagine all Anauroch to be like is known as "the Sword" and actually makes up only roughly the southern third of the region. North of that lies a region of wind-scoured bare rock, called "the Plain of Standing Stones" despite very little of it being flat plain. The most northerly region is a vast sheet of ice overlying bedrock and marked with many rifts named "the High Ice."
Related places.
The Empire of Shadows is nebulous country in southern Anauroch, mainly consisting of whatever territory the City of Shade controls at any given time. The Shadovar are currently striving to make the Empire of Shadows into a cohesive and permanent nation.
Hlaungadath is one of the three floating cities that Mystra saved during the destruction of Netheril. It is a city that landed near the "High Ice" and was eventually abandoned. The drow in the "War of the Spider Queen" series arrive here by means of a portal. They are forced to flee after they are set upon by lamias (humanoid lions that work magic) and their legions of asabis.
Reghed, or "High Ice", is a frozen wasteland located on a plateau in northern Anauroch.
C.
Chultan Peninsula.
The Chultan Peninsula is a peninsula with a tropical climate that lies at the tip of Southwest Faerûn on the continent of Faerûn. It is positioned east of the island kingdoms of Nimbral and Lantan, and to the west of Halruaa.
Related places.
Entirely covered by jungle, Chult is the name of the jungle that entirely covers the Chultan Peninsula. It is inhabited by dinosaurs and was at the dawn of time one of the most powerful empires, ruled by the sarrukh. There are 440,000 people, of many different species, living in Chult. Mainly pseudo African humans, there are sizable numbers of goblins and lizardfolk, as well as wild dwarves and pterafolk.
There are many tribes living throughout the jungle, while the human settlements is governed by a theocracy from the capital of Mezro.
The Flaming Fist mercenary company has, following an expedition for Anchorome in search of wealth, set up the small fort Belurian in Chult.
Samarach is a small country in the southern part of the Chultan peninsula, with the capital of Samargol.
Tashalar is a country to the east of the Chultan peninsula, linking the peninsula with the continent, more specifically the country of Halruaa. It is a merchant oligarchy of 900,000 inhabitants, mainly humans, but with a small minority of lizardfolk and yuan-ti as well. It is governed from the capital of Tashluta.
Cold Lands.
The Cold Lands is a region of Faerûn. Centered around the Great Glacier, a glacier formerly inhabited by the empire of Pelvuria, the Cold Lands are now scarcely populated because of the harsh arctic climate.
The countries of Vaasa and Damara are found here, as are Sossal and Narfell.
Cormanthor.
Cormanthor is an ancient forest realm in the fictional fantasy setting of the "Forgotten Realms".
Cormanthor was long the place of the elven empire of Cormanthyr, Cormanthor being both the name of the forest and of the capital. After the Elven Retreat only a small number of elves remain, with the main part of the population leaving for Evereska or Evermeet.
Publication.
The realm of Cormanthor was the subject of "Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves". Written by Steven E. Schend and Kevin Melka and published in 1998 by TSR, this "AD&D" Second Edition source book contains information on the physiology and mindset of elves; the history of the elves; Cormanthyr, Myth Drannor, Semberholme, the Tangled Vale, the Elven Court, and Windsong Tower; elven magic, including notable elves of the Art such as the Srinshee, mythals, and magical items; and more.
D.
Dragon Coast.
The Dragon Coast is a geographical region on the continent of Faerûn. It lies at the western extent of the Sea of Fallen Stars, on the southern shore of the Dragonmere, and to the north of the Shinning Plains. To the east it borders upon the nation of Turmish. Much of this land is occupied by the forest Gulthmere. It is separated from Turmish by the Orsraun Mountains.
Unlike nearby Cormyr and Sembia, the Dragon Coast has never been able to unite, and the region has seen the rise and fall of numerous city-states. Corruption is commonplace. The Red Wizards of Thay and the Cult of the Dragon both make strategic use of the region.
H.
Hordelands.
The Hordelands (also known as the Endless Wastes) is a region in the fictional fantasy setting of the Forgotten Realms, modelled on the steppes of Mongolia and Central Asia. It was once the territory of the mighty empire of Raumathar.
The Hordelands is the Faerûnian name of the region, though it goes by a number of names in other countries; Al-Tirmaq (Durpar), Plain of Horses (Kara-Tur), or Taan as its inhabitants call it. Now, the Hordelands is populated by the Mongol-like Tuigans. It is bordered on the north by Yal-Tengri, on the west by Narfell, Rashemen and Thay, on the south by Murghôm, Semphar and the massive Himalaya-like Yehimal mountain range, and on the East by the empire of Shou Lung.
Notable features.
There are three ways to go from Faerûn to Kara-Tur:
I.
Island Kingdoms of Faerûn.
The Island Kingdoms of Faerûn are island realms, spread out across the continent of Faerûn. They were detailed in "FR2, Moonshae", published in 1987 by TSR, Inc., focusing largely on the Moonshae Isles. Mainly located in the vast Trackless Sea, the equivalent of the Atlantic Ocean, the islands are small, but significant, as both the home and main place of worship of the elves, Evermeet, and of the gnomes, Lantan.
Other notable locations of island kingdoms are the Shining Sea and the Lake of Steam.
Related places.
The distant island of Nimbral, is also known as the Sea Haven, is located to the southwest of Lantan, in the Trackless Sea. The deceptive inhabitants, called Nimbrali, are expatriates from Halruaa, focusing heavily on the school of illusion, and are all accomplished illusionists. It seems their prolonged contact with magic changed their mage into something else than humans. Nimbral illusionists do not have any forbidden school of magic.
Prespur is an isle located in the Sea of Fallen Stars.
Tharsult is an island of unscrupulous traders, located in the Shining Sea, with the capital of Urbeth.
L.
Lost Empires of Faerûn.
The Lost Empires of Faerûn are part of the fictional fantasy setting of the "Forgotten Realms". Nearly all of the lands and cities on Abeir-Toril are built on the ruins of lost empires, and throughout the Faerûnian countryside, terrible secrets of an age past lie in waiting.
Illefarn, Imaskar, and Netheril were also major Lost Empires.
The Lost Empires.
Ammarindar is a dwarven kingdom founded before Cormanthyr and "Netheril".
Athalantar, the "Kingdom of the Stag" (or the "Stag Kingdom") is Elminster's birthplace. Its capital city, Hastarl, was located at the junction of the Unicorn Run and the River Delimbiyr, a site presently occupied by the village of Secomber.
Coramshan is the ancestor of Calimshan.
Deep Shanatar was once High Shanatar, a mighty dwarven realm in the Underdark. Of the original eight kingdoms that composed it, the sole survivor is the reclusive Iltkazar.
Eaerlann was an ancient elven empire located in the High Forest.
Eastern Shaar was once the kingdom of titans, but is now nothing more than an extension of the Shaar. It is bordered to the north by the country Unther, to the east by the Giant's Belt mountain range (which separates it from Raurin), to the south by the Toadsquat Mountains, and to the west by the Great Rift, which separates it from the Shaar. Its major feature is the Council Hills.
Guge is an ancient kingdom that existed in the Endless Wastes. It is apparently inspired by the real ancient kingdom of Guge in Western Tibet.
Ilythiir was the ancient elven empire of the dark-skinned, tropical elves who became the drow.
Jhaamdath was a militaristic psiocracy (government by psionicists), one of the few on Toril. This ancestor of present Chondath was founded circa –5800 DR and destroyed in –255 DR by elven high mages of Nikerymath. Their tutelar divinity was Auppenser.
Miyeritar was an ancient elven empire of Dark and Green Elves. At its height, it was the center of Elven art and High Magic, but was destroyed by the evil Empire of Gold and Moon Elves, Vyshaantar. Recently, a small portion of this realm was brought back by the wizard Khelben, in the novel "Blackstaff", by Steven Schend.
Pelvuria, also known as "The Great Glacier", is a great, magical glacier created in -2550 DR that was once Ostoria, the kingdom of Giants (the city of Gharreil is a testimony of it). It is presently home to several kingdoms: Alpuk, Angalpuk, Nakvalicach and Novularond.
Raumathar was the great eastern empire that once included Rashemen and Thay. It is over two millennia old and almost a thousand years dead, perishing in battle with its foe Narfell. Its people were known as powerful battle-wizards, and their art of fighting is still known by some.
An ancient empire of Giants located in the North, Ostoria was divided up into separate kingdoms for each of the giant races. A falling between the giants and giant-kin led to the destruction of the empire and the creation of the Great Glacier (Pelvuria).
Shantel Othreier was an ancient elven empire.
A country that had occupied the once fertile lands of the current Quoya desert, Tsharoon lies in the Endless wastes.
M.
Moonsea.
The Moonsea is a region in the North of Faerûn. The region is dominated by the large titular lake Moonsea, that is connected to the Sea of Fallen Stars to the south by the River Lis. The shoreline is a wild, frontier area that is home to several city states that are dominated by despots, and the region doesn't have a capital.
The most notable of the city-states is Zhentil Keep at the western end, the greatest base of operations of the once-secret society of the Zhentarim; Mulmaster in the southeast; Phlan; Melvaunt on the northern side; and Hillsfar in the southwest. The region is rich in ruins (notably the one of Northkeep), monsters, pirates, and harsh, cold terrains.
West of the Moonsea is the northernmost of the Dales, Teshendale. North-west of the sea are the Dragonspine Mountains.
Related places.
The Dragonspine Mountains is a mountain range northwest of the Moonsea, which houses the infamous Citadel of the Raven on their western slopes.
The sunken city of Northkeep was the first human settlement on the shores of the Moonsea.
Voonlar is a place conquered by the Zhentarim.
O.
Old Kingdoms.
The Old Kingdoms of Faerûn is a region of kingdoms. Located in the East Faerûn region, the Old Kingdoms lie on the coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars. They were once powerful nations, but over the centuries the region has succumbed to internal warring, which has weakened the countries.
The nations of Chessenta, Mulhorand, Murghôm, Semphar, and Unther are found in this region.
S.
Savage Frontier.
The Savage Frontier is a region of the subcontinent of Faerûn. It is situated west of the Silver Marches and east of the Sword Coast, where the cities of Neverwinter and Luskan lie. This region was first detailed in "FR5, The Savage Frontier", published in 1988.
Contrary to its name, much of the area is really not a savage frontier and it is quite civilized. In some "Dungeons & Dragons" modules, however, broader conflicts (such as those between Luskan and Waterdeep, the cities and the Zhentarim etc.) make the area a dangerous one.
The MMORPG "Neverwinter Nights" (AOL, 1991–1997) and the video games "Neverwinter Nights", "Gateway to the Savage Frontier" and "Treasures of the Savage Frontier" are all set in this region.
Sea of Fallen Stars.
The largest inland body of water in the world of Faerûn, the Sea of Fallen Stars is said to have been formed by a star sent by deities to punish titan's arrogance (some say it was actually the eggs of the first dragons). Its major ramifications include the "Dragonmere" (a.k.a. Lake of Dragons) on the West, the Moonsea on the North, the "Alamber Sea" on the East and the Vilhon Reach on the South. They are just the most notable ones, others being the Lake of the Long Arm, the Deepwash, the Bay of Chessenta, the Akanamere, the Alaor or the Easting Reach.
Its surrounding lands include Cormyr, the Dalelands, Sembia, the Vast, Impiltur, The Great Dale, Thesk, Aglarond, Altumbel, Thay, the Priador, Mulhorand, Unther, Chessenta, Chondath, Turmish, the Shining Plains and the Dragon Coast.
Some notable isles include the Pirate Isles and the Isle of Prespur.
Sea of Moving Ice.
North of Icewind Dale and Reghed, the Sea of Moving Ice is the northernmost place in known Faerûn and is located west of the Endless Ice Sea. Almost completely uncharted, it is filled with icebergs and Faerûnians believe that beyond it lies the domain of their gods.
Shaar.
Shaar and the Eastern Shaar is a region on the continent of Faerûn. The vast savannah-like landscape that forms Shaar is modeled after African savannah and veldt. It is populated by an endemic race of elephant-like humanoids known as loxos, as well as by the insectoid thri-kreens and the tauric wemics.
“Thousands of miles of grass, as far as the eye can see, sloping from east to west but with a cliff in the middle, the Landrise, where west drops down to east. The Eastern Shaar is more dry, but both bake by day and freeze by night. Fierce horse nomads herd rothé, wemics and centaurs, and there must be something worth trading for out there, hidden in all that open space. They give us slaves and trinkets and a little ivory, but would rather raid the Border Kingdoms and everywhere else they can reach. Magnificent horses, but they seem to sicken if taken away in trade.”
Shining South.
The Shining South is a region which lies on the southern coast of the continent, out to the Great Sea, stretching from South Faerûn to Southeast Faerûn, and consists of many city-states and kingdoms.
The nations of Durpar, Estagund, Halruaa, Luiren, and Var the Golden are found here, as well as the region called Shaar.
Related places.
The Great Rift is the land of the Gold Dwarves, though there is also a human city nearby, called Khôltar. The land is inhabited by 1,300,000 dwarves, gnomes, halflings, and the country, called the Deep Realm, is ruled by a monarchy from the capital of Underhome.
Rethild, also known as the Great Swamp, is a swamp cursed by an ancient wizard, and the home of the magic-draining monsters called larakens. It is separated from Halruaa by the East Wall Mountains (Muaraghal).
Silver Marches.
Silver Marches (formerly known as Luruar) is a region and political entity on the continent of Faerûn.
It is bordered by the Anauroch desert to the east, the High Forest to the south, the Savage Frontier to the west and the Spine of the World mountain range to the north and has an estimated population of 1,090,800.
The confederation of the Silver Marches consists of its capital city Silverymoon (est. population 37,073) as well as Everlund, Sundabar, Mithril Hall (est. population 4,991), Citadel Adbar, Citadel Felbarr and some minor towns and villages, including Quaervarr in the Moonwood, Deadsnows and Newfort. The current leader of the confederation is High Lady Alustriel Silverhand, one of the many chosen of Mystra.
One of the more well known locations in the Silver Marches is Beorunna's Well (estimated population 2,139), which is featured in the video game "Neverwinter Nights".
Related places.
A Dwarven Citadel to the east of Sundabar, Citadel Adbar is ruled by the venerabal King Harbromme, and protected by the famed Iron Guard.
A large, dense forest dominated by evergreens, shadowtops, and duskwoods, the Moonwood is home to few natural predators and no orcs or goblinoids. Its southern fringes are peaceful enough home to small bands of moon elves and wood elves who roam its green depths and fair meadows, as well as the rustic homes of woodcutters and trappers. The northern depths are a different matter—there, the woods become darker, thcker, and more overgrown, and the People of the Black Blood hunt. The Moonwood is a little over a hundred miles from north to south, and approximately 60 miles wide in the Northern parts. It tapers down to the south west.
The Moonwood is home to a few characters in the Drizzt Do'Urden series by R.A. Salvatore including Ellifain Tuuserail, Tarathiel, and Innovindil.
Spine of the World.
The Spine of the World is the range of mountains in Northern Faerûn that lies just south of Icewind Dale and the northern icecaps. It is said to be almost impossible to cross, teeming with ogres, orcs, and other foul creatures of the north. Bards say that if one does manage to cross it, one comes to an endless sea of mist and ice, in which white dragons (the least intelligent of true dragons) wait to consume anything that comes their way. This is just a myth, however, as white dragons are quite rare.
"The Spine of the World" is also a novel by R. A. Salvatore.
Sword Coast.
The Sword Coast is a portion of the northwestern coast of Faerûn, and stretches from the city-state of Baldur's Gate, in the south, along the coast of the Sea of Swords, to city-state Waterdeep, and from Waterdeep further north to Neverwinter, Luskan, and Icewind Dale, the Arctic and northernmost region of the Sword Coast.
The metropolises of Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate are not counted as part of the Sword Coast, instead Baldur's Gate lies in the Western Heartlands, while Waterdeep is an independent city-state. Mirabar and Ten Towns are found here.
Because of its quasi-lawless, "frontier" setting, being a place where all races can meet and interact, it has been the setting for many modules (especially those subtitled with the "Savage Frontier" name), as well as the MMORPG "Neverwinter Nights" (AOL, 1991–1997) and the video games "Neverwinter Nights" (Bioware, 2002), "Baldur's Gate", "Gateway to the Savage Frontier" and "Treasures of the Savage Frontier".
"" is the title of an expansion disc for the game "Baldur's Gate".
Related places.
Icewind Dale is a sub-Arctic region, along the northernmost part of the Sword Coast. It is famous because many events involving the drow hero, Drizzt Do'Urden, occurred here, chronicled in "The Icewind Dale Trilogy", a series of fantasy novels by R. A. Salvatore.
Icewind Dale is an icy tundra and the northernmost explored area of Faerûn. Its only permanent settlements are known as the Ten Towns, a confederation of a number of minor settlements cooperating with each other. The region is mainly populated by fishermen, craftsmen, rangers, dwarves mining the deeps for minerals and precious stones, barbarians, and merchants who tolerate the hostile climate in the hope of trading in ivory and gems. The "capital" of the region is the town of Bryn Shander.
Another notable feature of Icewind Dale is Kelvin's Cairn, a mountain north of Ten Towns. It was in a cavern on the northern face of this mountain that Drizzt Do'Urden resided for some time as a sort of 'scout' for Ten Towns.
U.
Unapproachable East.
The Unapproachable East is a region on the subcontinent of Faerûn. It is a border region between the Northeast Faerûn and East Faerûn. The region sports great adversity; from the scheming Red Wizards of Thay to the boisterous barbarians of Rashemen, it is a place rife with conflict. The region is bordered to the south by the Old Kingdoms, and to the north by the Cold Lands. To the northeast are the Hordelands.
The nations of Aglarond, Impiltur, Rashemen, Thay, and Thesk are found in this region.
Related places.
The Great Dale is governed by a Druidic hierarchy, under rule of Nentyarch. It is a human land, of 200,000 inhabitants.
According to rumours, The Great Dale is the place from which Dalelanders come.
V.
The Vast.
The Vast is a region on the continent of Faerûn. The most important places in The Vast are the cities of Ravens Bluff and Sarbreenar.
Vilhon Reach.
The Vilhon Reach is a region on the fictional continent of Faerûn in the role-playing game setting of the "Forgotten Realms". The region is named after a body of water called the Vilhon Reach, a part of the Sea of Fallen Stars.
Through its many port cities, the Vilhon Reach is established as an essential trade center between the cities of the southern bodies of water, the Lake of Steam and the Shining Sea, and the many kingdoms and city-states around the inner sea of the continent, the Sea of Fallen Stars.
The nations of Chondath and Turmish are found in this region.
Related places.
Hlondeth is an independent city-state at the end of the "Vilhon Reach" which controls a region of mountainous territory to the southwest of Turmish. The city has long had an association with serpents, and is ruled by the Extaminos family, with mixed blood that is not quite human.
The Shining Plains is a region located west of Turmish, the city of "Ormath", established in 125 DR is a location of interest.
W.
Western Heartlands.
The Western Heartlands are a fictional region in the fantasy setting of the "Forgotten Realms". Located in West Faerûn, the Western Heartlands stretches west from Cormyr and the Dragon Coast to the east, and slowly blends into the coastal Sword Coast region at the Sea of Swords. The Western Heartlands is in no way a state, but consists of numerous city-states and hamlets, with the metropolis of Waterdeep its most dominant city.
Other locations found in the Western Heartlands include the city of Baldur's Gate, Daggerford, Castle Darkhold, Dragonspear Castle, Evereska, the High Moor, Scornubel, and Secomber.

Beregost was founded around a school of magic run by the wizard Ulcaster, but the school is now but ruins to the east of the town.
In 1373, Beregost was the site of a battle between two metallic dragons, the copper dragon Chalintash and the mercury dragon Trinculo. These events are contained in Murray J.D. Leeder's short story "The Strength of the Jester," in the anthology "Realms of the Dragons II".
The fortress library of Candlekeep stands on a cliff, looking down upon the Sea of Swords. The library contains every book and scroll of knowledge possible, and it was the home of the great seer Alaundo, who among other visions, foresaw the coming of the Bhaalspawn. Candlekeep is currently ruled by the "Keeper of the Tomes", Ulraunt, and his assistant, "First Reader" Tethtoril.
To gain entry to the halls of wisdom, a visitor must gift the library collection with a new tome of immense value.
The small community of monks and scholars residing in Candlekeep mainly favours Oghma, the god of knowledge, as well as the deities Deneir, Gond, and Milil.
The Friendly Arm Inn is a stone keep which houses the titular inn and is surrounded by an outer wall, which also protects the Temple of Wisdom (a shrine dedicated to Garl Glittergold), a handful of houses, and stables. With its location on the trade way between Baldur's Gate and the town of Beregost, the Friendly Arm is a safe haven for travellers.

Navesink tribe

The Navesink, or Navisink, (or Nave Sinck) were a group of Lenape who inhabited the Raritan Bayshore near Sandy Hook and Mount Mitchill in northern North Jersey in the United States.
Their territory included the peninsula, as well as the highlands south of it, where they lived along its cliffs and creeks. Archeological artifacts have been found throughout this area. The Navesink shared the totem, a turtle, and spoke the same Lenape dialect, Unami, as their neighbors, the Raritan, and other groups such as the Hackensack and Tappan.
Early European contact was in the 16th and 17th centuries. The explorer Henry Hudson, an English sea captain first had contact with the Navesink among Native Americans, as recorded in journals from his ship, the "Halve Maen" on September 3, 1609. When crew went off the ship, they were attacked by Navesink. John Colman was killed and was said to be buried at what is now called Coleman's Point.
Cornelius Van Werckhoven, an investor in New Netherland purchased a tract called "Nevesings" in November 1651. 
At the time of the surrender of the Dutch provincial colony of New Netherland to the British in 1664, the Navesink sachem, or chief, was "Passachquon". In 1668, English settlers bought the whole peninsula from the Navesink Lenape and called it Portland Poynt.
Middletown Township, New Jersey is one of the oldest sites of European settlement in New Jersey., originally formed on October 31, 1693.

Plaza San Martín (Lima)

The Plaza San Martín is one of the most representative public spaces of the city of Lima, Peru. It is located at the ninth block of Colmena avenue, within the Historic Centre of Lima which was declared a World Heritage Site in 1988 by UNESCO. It is located near the Plaza Mayor of Lima and is connected to it by the Jiron de la Union. Its central monument gives homage to Peru's liberator, José de San Martín.
History.
Precedents.
The location of the plaza previously was home to the San Juan de Dios hospital which was torn down in 1850 and replaced by a railway station, which in turn was torn down between 1911 and 1918. 
Construction.
The Plaza San Martín was inaugurated on July 27, 1921 in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the independence of Peru. The design, ornamentation, furnishing, and gardening of the plaza was designed by Manuel Piqueras Cotolí. The benches and handrails were constructed out of marble and the paving, of granite. There were also four water fountains, bronze streetlamps, and flower-filled gardens. The design for the monument to José de San Martín was chosen in an contest in which the design created by the Spanish sculptor Mariano Benlliure emerged victorious and illustrated San Martin during his voyage across the Andes.
Architecture.
The construction of the buildings that surrounded the plaza occurred at a gradual pace. The Colón Theater and the Giacoletti buildings were the first structures to be built and were erected in 1914 before the construction of the plaza. The other buildings were later built in three stages. The Hotel Bolivar was built in 1924 and was designed by Rafael Marquina. The Zela and Pumacahua arcades were built during the second stage in 1926 and also were designed by Rafael Marquina. The Club Nacional was built in 1929 by Ricardo de Jaxa Malachowski and Enrique Bianchi. In the third and final stage of the project from 1935-1945 the remaining flanks of the plaza were built up with the construction of the Cine Metro, Fénix, Boza, and Sudamérica buildings which were built in the "Neocolonial" style (similar to the Spanish Colonial Revival architecture).
As a result, the plaza maintains uniformity with respect to its buildings' facades. Its overall appearance is primarily baroque; the buildings, plaza, and central monument all cohere to uniform and specific styles. The architectural style to which most of the surrounding buildings belong to is that of the neohispanic or neocolonial styles within the realm of European derived architecture.

Rashad Andre Jennings (born March 26, 1985) is an American football running back for the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the seventh round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He played college football at Liberty.
College career.
He went to Pittsburgh in 2005 and became only the fourth true freshman running back to start there. However, his father became ill, and he transferred to Liberty to be closer to home in spring 2006. He was suspended for the first two games of the 2007 season due to a rules violation concerning a campus housing stipend. Despite this, he excelled at Liberty, setting a Big South Conference record with 3,633 yards with 42 TDs and a 5.7 yards per carry average.
Professional career.
Jacksonville Jaguars.
After being coached by the Jacksonville Jaguars' staff during the 2009 Senior Bowl, Jennings was selected by them in the seventh round (250th overall) of the 2009 NFL Draft. He scored his first career touchdown in Week 9 against the Kansas City Chiefs, rushing for 28 yards. In 2011, he suffered a concussion in the first preseason game, and then injured his knee in the third pre-season game. After the preseason, he was placed on injured reserve, ending his 2011 season.
Jennings was named the starting running back for the team's 2012 regular season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. This was due to a contract holdout by Maurice Jones-Drew, who reported to the team just one week before the game. Jones-Drew returned to the starting lineup the following week against the Houston Texans. He was placed on season-ending injured reserve on December 24, 2012.
Oakland Raiders.
Jennings was signed by the Oakland Raiders on April 10, 2013.
Jennings is the backup running back to Darren McFadden. McFadden, the often injured running back, missed many games the 2013 season, thus Jennings became the starting running back weeks 5, 10, 11, 12, (Jennings was injured week 14 against the Jets so fullback Marcel Reece got the starting nod that day) and 15. Jennings saw his best rushing game of the season on week 11 against Houston where he rushed 22 times for 150 yards (6.8 ypc) with one touchdown. He also broke out for an 80 yard play that game.

Zane Lewis (born 1981) is an American contemporary artist who lives and works in New York.
Lewis frequently blurs conventional distinctions between painting and sculpture sometimes presenting his work in an installation-type format. For example, Lewis used a unique drip painting technique in which cascades of poured paint leaked from canvases and spilled onto the floor of the exhibition space. Christopher Bollen, Editor of "Interview" Magazine, called this method of Lewis' "making art bleed." "The artist allows the gash to “bleed” brightly colored paint (which he has applied), in order to express a transient and dying glamor." 
Lewis was included in the "Wall Street Journal" article titled "The 23-Year Old Masters," along with Ryan Trecartin. He has exhibited in the Whitney Museum of American Art Party alongside such artists as Terence Koh.
And featured as a "Groundbreaker" artist in the Whitney Museum groundbreaking ceremony for the new location in lower Manhattan.

Housing.
Early Midton was started in 1944 and consisted of 11 pre-fabricated) houses (pre-fabs) built on part of the "Tower Hill" The houses were made of asbestos with flat roofs. These houses were Winston Churchills solution to the post war housing shortage. The houses were designed to last for only 10 years, but in fact they stood well into the 1960s.
Their main features were that they were fully fitted with Electric Cooker, refrigerator, Coal fire, 2 bedrooms, bathroom, and front and rear garden space. The rent at that time was 10 shillings per week equal. There was no bus service into the town of Gourock approx 1 mile away. With no shops and the roads still under development all provisions had to be physically carried from the town to Midton. The local farm (Holburns) in the area could provide milk. The cows from the farm grazed on tower hill and in the early days ware a bit of a pest when they got into the gardens causing havoc.

Ritch Workman

Ritch Workman (born on May 3, 1973) is a Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 52nd District, which includes southern Brevard County, stretching from Melbourne to Palm Shores, since 2012, and previously representing the 30th District from 2008 to 2012.
History.
Workman was born in Belleville, Ontario, in 1973, and in 1980, his family moved from Canada to the state of Florida, despite never having been there before, due to the fact that Pierre Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada were successful in the 1980 federal election, and his father did not want to live in a socialist country. Workman graduated from Satellite High School in Satellite Beach and then attended Appalachian State University, where he graduated in 1995. Following graduation, he served in the National Guard from 1990 to 2005, including as a Battery Commander in Operation Noble Eagle. When incumbent State Representative Mike Haridopolos was elected to the Florida Senate in a 2003 special election, Workman ran to succeed him in the 30th District, which stretched from Rockledge to Palm Bay in southern Brevard County. Workman ultimately lost to Thad Altman in the Republican primary, receiving 29% of the vote to Altman's 41%.
Florida House of Representatives.
When Altman opted to run for the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election in 2008, Workman ran to succeed him. In the Republican primary, Workman faced Tres Holton, whom he easily defeated, winning 62% of the vote. He faced Amy Tidd, the Democratic nominee, and, following a contentious campaign, narrowly defeated her, winning 54% of the vote to Tidd's 46%. When running for re-election in 2010, Workman once again faced Tidd, and he campaigned on his sponsorship of legislation similar to SB 1070 in Arizona, which would allow police officers to "detain a person who cannot prove their citizenship or legal status." When Tidd responded that she was "still waiting to see his papers," Workman responded, "Is it because I'm white that this is not a racial sur? I'm offended, but she makes my point for me. I'm pro-immigration reform because when someone comes here illegally, it diminishes my struggle." The "Orlando Sentinel" endorsed Tidd over Workman, criticizing Workman's "dubious priorities," including "aligning himself with a fringe group that rejects federal authority over states, though he sees no contradiction in Florida taking billions of dollars in stimulus money from Washington, D.C." Despite this, Workman managed to expand his margin of victory over Tidd, defeating her in a landslide with 61% of the vote.
In 2012, when the state's legislative districts were reconfigured, Workman was moved into the 52nd District, which included most of the territory that he previously represented in the 30th District. He faced no opposition in the Republican primary or the general election, and won his third term entirely uncontested.

<doc id="20824431" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20824431" title="Muslim Independent Party">
Muslim Independent Party

This party was floated in 1936 by the influence of Maulana Sajjad - that time Amir of Imarat-e-Sharia, Bihar. The need of such party was felt by Muslims of Bihar when they got dissillusoned from Congress and Muslim League. As congress was not giving a clear policy statement for the country's second largest minority and Muslim League was giving the slogan of separate nation which was dividing the country so Muslims of Bihar decided to float their own Party.
Barrister Mohammad Yunus and Syed Abdul Aziz were two most influential leaders of Bihari Muslims at that time. Barrister Mohammad Yunus formed Muslim Independent Party showing their Non - Alliance to either congress or Muslim League by using word "Independent" and Syed Abdul Aziz formed Muslim United Party. In 1937 election party emerged as the largest Muslim political party in Bihar and second largest party in Bihar after Congress.
The Muslim Independent Party formed the government in Bihar in 1937. Mohammad Yunus, the President of the party, became the chief minister. It is a lesser known fact that Mohammad Yunus became first chief minister of Bihar on 1st April 1937. On 13th May 2012 that is on 60th death anniversary of Mohammad Yunus when addressing a conference "Mohammad Yunus - Hayat wa Khidmaat" organised by Mohammad Kashif yunus, the great grandson of Mohammad Yunus and also Chairman of Barrister Yunus Foundation, Nitish Kumar announced that Bihar Government will arrange "Rajkiya Samaroh" from next year on the occasion of Birthday of Mohammad Yunus which is on 4th May. On 4th May, 2013 it was the first time that Bihar government observed birth anniversary of Mohammad Yunus as "Rajkiye Samaroh" in Sri Krishna Memorial Hall attended by Sri Nand Kishore Yadav and Mohammad Kashif Yunus and others. 
Out of 40 seats reserved for Muslims, Muslim Independent Party won 20. Muslim United Party of Syed Abdul Aziz won 7 Muslim seats. Ahrar party also tried but failed to secure any seat. 4 Muslims won on congress ticket. 8 Independent uslim candidate also won. Some prominent names who won on Muslim Independent party ticket are Barrister Mohammad Yunus from Patna West (Rural), Maulana Minatullah Rahmani from Bhagalpur/Munger.
Begum Imam won from Patna (women seat) independent in this election. Two more important Muslim names who won elections in 1937 were Prof. Abdul Bari from Champaran on congress ticket and Syed Abdul Aziz of United Party. 
hen youth leader Jayaprakash Narayan (as a staunch socialist) harshly criticised Barrister's Yunus acceptance to the governor's invitation for formation of the government. His party (Congress Socialist Party) continued protests to the Muslim Independent Party government.
As Muslim Independent Party was the party which got 20 seats from 40 seats reserved for Muslim and congress got only 4 Muslim seats, Muslim independent Party wanted to form an Alliance govt. with congress so that a better answer could be given to Muslim League that Hindu and Muslims, these two biggest religious majorities could exist with equal dignity and rights but congress refused to barrister Yunus's brilliant proposal and did it best that formed the government alone. Congress which was having just 4 Muslim Members assembly out of 40 didn't showed any respect of Muslim mandate which was given to Muslim independent party in Bihar. Same situation aroses in West Bengal. Which ultimately just after 10 years resulted in partition of India.
All these records are given in the diary of Barrister Yasin Yunus who was elder son and Political secretary of his father Barrister Mohammad Yunus. The diary was later with Mohammad Yaqub Yunus, younger son of Barrister Yunus and Founder president of Bihar Muslim Majlise-e-Mushawarat Which is now with Baber Yunus (Director, Yunus Construction Pvt. Ltd. and son of Late Yaqub Yunus). After his government fell, the first Congress Ministry (led by Premier Sri Krishna Singh and Dr. A.N. Sinha as deputy premier) came to existence.
Although the party lost the power soon and congress formed the govt. in state. (REF: 2 December 1937 Indian Nation Daily)
It is one of the aspiring fact of those days that the Pioneer of the Party Maulana Abul Mohasin Sajjad (RH) used to attend all the meetings of the party which were mostly held in Fraser Road (now Maulana Mazhar-ul-Haq Road) or Bankipur. Sometimes it was late nights when these meetings used to finish. As from Patna to Phulwari, Tam Tam/ Tanga was the only transportation available but sometimes even the Tanga was not available in late night. Maulana Sajjad (RA) along with Maulana Minatullah Rahmani (RA) used to go back on foot, walking all along from Patna Railway station to Phulwari (around 7-8 Kilometer). Maulana Sajjad used to avoid using car of rich leaders of Party like Mohammad Yunus.

Lockdown (2009)

Lockdown (2009) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion, which took place on April 19, 2009 at the Liacouras Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was the fifth event under the Lockdown chronology. In the tradition of Lockdown events, every match took place inside a steel structure with six sides, known as Six Sides of Steel.
The main event was a Six Sides of Steel cage match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which Mick Foley defeated the reigning champion, Sting, to win the championship. Following another tradition of Lockdown events, TNA held the annual Lethal Lockdown match, which was contested inside a steel structure with a flat roof; in this match, Team Jarrett defeated Team Angle. Two featured bouts were scheduled on the undercard. In a Philadelphia Street Fight for the TNA World Tag Team and IWGP World Tag Team Championships, Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon) defeated Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) to retain the IWGP World Tag Team and to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship. The other bout was a Doomsday Chamber of Blood match, which saw Matt Morgan defeat Abyss.
Mick Foley chronicled the build to his match against Sting in the fourth volume of his memoirs, .
Background.
Lockdown featured nine professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers will be portrayed as either villains or heroes in the scripted events that build tension and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches. Traditionally, every match was contested inside a 16 foot (4.9 m) high steel structure with six sides known as Six Sides of Steel.
The main event at Lockdown featured TNA World Heavyweight Champion Sting defending the title against Mick Foley in a Six Sides of Steel cage match. On the March 19 episode of TNA's primary television program, "TNA Impact!", the team of Foley and Jeff Jarrett defeated the team of Kurt Angle and Sting, after Foley hit Sting with a steel chair which allowed Foley to gain the pinfall victory. As a result of Foley's actions, Sting challenged him to a match at Lockdown with the TNA World Heavyweight Championship on the line.
Continuing another tradition of Lockdown events, TNA held the fifth annual Lethal Lockdown match. In this match, one wrestler from each four-member team started in the ring; after five minutes, another wrestler entered, followed two minutes later by a member of the other team. Every two minutes, a new wrestler entered until all ten were in the ring; at this point a ceiling with weapons attached was lowered and pinfalls or submissions were allowed. On the March 26 episode of "Impact!", a 20–man Six Sides of Steel Gauntlet match was held to determine the two captains for the match at Lockdown; the last two wrestlers to not be eliminated in the match would win this honor. Kurt Angle and Samoa Joe were last two remaining wrestlers in the contest. Joe refused to be captain of his team at Lockdown so Jarrett was appointed in his place on the April 3 episode of "Impact!"; setting up the official teams at Lockdown—Team Angle and Team Jarrett. Also on that episode, Booker T, Kevin Nash, and Scott Steiner were chosen by Angle to compete alongside him at Lockdown, while A.J. Styles was given the third spot in Team Jarrett; joining Jarrett and Joe. On the April 10 episode of "Impact!", Christopher Daniels was announced as the fourth member of Team Jarrett.
The main feud in the tag team division was between Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon) and Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm). Beer Money, the TNA World Tag team Champions, granted Team 3D a title shot at Lockdown in Philadelphia (the city where Team 3D wrestled when apart of the hardcore wrestling promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling). Team 3D, who were the IWGP Tag Team Championsions agreed to the match and announced they would defend their IWGP titles too - making the winner of the match both TNA and IWGP Tag Team Champions.

Shannon Baker

Shannon Baker is a Canadian model, actress, spokesperson, and businessperson,
better known with her twin sister Shauna as the The Baker Twins. She and her twin sister appeared on Tyra Banks' talk show "The Tyra Banks Show" to talk about the stereotypes put on Native American and First Nations people and lack of representation.
Early life.
Baker was born in Stellat'en First Nation reservation, British Columbia, Canada. Shannon is of the Carrier Dene tribe. As a baby an elder put warm bee honey in the palm of her hands so that she may have strong artistic abilities. She has always been in competitions since being a small child. At age 16, she was in competition for classical music.
Personal life.
In keeping with the traditions of the Carrier-Sekani people, Shannon and Shauna were raised by their grandmother, Emma Baker. Shannon competed in the Miss Universe Canada 2007 pageant without Shauna by her side. She explained that the competition made her more aware of how being a twin was a "huge facet of her identity". The twins believe being identified as a unit works to their advantage.
Shannon Baker currently resides in Los Angeles, California.
Career.
Modeling.
Her first introduction into modeling occurred in a shopping mall, but Shannon and her sister believed it was scam. Shannon and her twin sister were frequently being approached by agencies, and decided to inspect each one closely. Both women manage their own model careers, and have been featured in several magazines such as:UMM Magazine, Vancouver Magazine, and Say Magazine. Shannon stated with her sister: "We firmly believe that First Nations people need to be represented in mainstream media a lot more, and feel that we can help to facilitate a positive profile for our people through initiatives like the Miss Universe Canada Pageant...I hope I can represent First Nations people in a really good way and that's why I am competing in the pageant. "
When Shannon competed in the Miss Universe Canada pageant she found the competition made her more aware of how being a twin was a "huge facet of her identity".
In 2007, Shannon and Shauna were scouted by a modeling scout from Playboy but declined the offer. In an interview Shauna recounted the experience: "We have gone this far keeping a clean image, why throw that out the window now? We want to show young ladies that you can be a good girl and still make it in this industry. There are enough half naked girls shown on television and music videos already, I wouldn’t want to blend in with them. Plus, I would be horrified if my little sister and little cousins saw me nude in a magazine." Shannon added: "We do not need Playboy to pioneer our careers. We will make it without being in Playboy. The industry is changing, and our generation will be the ones that pioneer that change. We want to work harder and so, we aren't going to take our clothes off just to boost our careers. We would rather take a route with obstacles rather than what many deem to be the ‘easy’ path. "
Move into television and film.
Shannon has been featured in the television show Smallville. Her single part became two roles when the producers found out about her identical twin.
Along with her sister, she has appeared in Tin Man, Sharp as Marbles, Hard Impact, A Wedding Story, amongst other films.
The twins made an appearance on The Tyra Banks show in 2007 to discuss stereotypes they deal with in the entertainment industry, as well as the media, and the misconceptions they have of First Nations people.

Sacrifice (2009)

Sacrifice (2009) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), which took place on May 24, 2009 at the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the fifth event under the Sacrifice chronology. There were eight matches on the card.
The show's main event was dubbed the Four Way Ultimate Sacrifice match, which pitted TNA World Heavyweight Champion, Mick Foley, against Sting, Kurt Angle, and Jeff Jarrett with each participant wagering an important aspect of their career: Foley's title, Sting's career, Angle's leadership of the Main Event Mafia, and Jarrett's shares in the company. The match was ultimately won by Sting, who pinned Angle, thus winning leadership of the Main Event Mafia. There were two other high-profile matches with A.J. Styles defending the TNA Legends Championship against Booker T in an "I Quit" match as well as Beer Money, Inc. winning the "Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament" against The British Invasion. Other matches on the undercard included: a six man tag team match between the team of Jay Lethal, Consequences Creed, and Eric Young versus the Motor City Machineguns and Sheik Abdul Bashir, Daffney versus Taylor Wilde in a Monster's Ball match, Christopher Daniels challenging Suicide for his TNA X Division Championship, Angelina Love defending her title against Awesome Kong, and Samoa Joe versus Kevin Nash.
Storylines.
Sacrifice featured eight professional wrestling matches and one pre-show match that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.
Another rivalry heading into Sacrifice was between A.J. Styles and Booker T. At Destination X, Styles won the TNA Legends Championship from Booker and since then, there had been constant confrontation between the two. On the April 30 edition of "Impact!", one final confrontation between the two led to TNA management scheduling Styles to defend his title in an "I Quit" match against Booker T; this match requires the two wrestlers to fight until one wrestler says, "I Quit", letting the other wrestler to win the match.
The main rivalry from the women's division was between Angelina Love (Lauren Williams) and Awesome Kong (Kia Stevens). At Lockdown, Love won the TNA Women's Knockout Championship from Kong in a three-way match by pinning Taylor Wilde (Shantelle Malawski). On the April 30 and May 7 editions of "Impact!", Kong defeated Love's associates in her group, The Beautiful People, Madison Rayne (Ashley Simmons) and Velvet Sky (Jamie Szantyr) (and later Love's manager, Cute Kip (Monty Sopp)) in stretcher matches. It was later announced that Love would defend her title against Kong at Sacrifice.
Another event that happened going into Sacrifice involved the tag team division. Current IWGP Tag Team and TNA World Tag Team Champions, Team 3D (Brother Ray (Mark LoMonaco and Brother Devon (Devon Hughes)), announced the "Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament", which was an eight-team, three-round single-elimination tournament with the winning team receiving a trophy, a check for $100,000, and a shot at the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On the May 7 edition of "Impact!", the semi finals took place with James Storm and Robert Roode, also known as Beer Money, Inc., advancing to the finals by defeating the team of Eric Young and Jethro Holliday (William Mueller). The following week of "Impact" had Doug Williams and Brutus Magnus (Nick Aldis) (collectively known as The British Invasion) advancing to the finals after defeating Suicide and Amazing Red.
Event.
Pre-show.
Before the show was broadcast live, there was a match that aired on TNA's Web site and for free on television, which pitted Amazing Red against Kiyoshi (Akira Raijin). Red won the match by pinfall after hitting a standing shooting star press.
Preliminary matches.
The coming match was Monster's Ball between Taylor Wilde and Daffney (Shannon Spruill), with Abyss (Chris Parks) in her corner, that saw both women exchange weapons shots before Wilde was able to get a pinfall victory over Daffney after using a fireman's carry takeover to throw Daffney onto a trash can. Following the match, Abyss' storyline therapist, Dr. Stevie (Michael Manna), came down to the ring with a bag filled with thumbtacks, and demanded Abyss to throw Wilde onto the contents of the bag that were spilled onto the mat. After some influence from Lauren (Lauren Brooke), an interviewer for TNA with personal ties to both Wilde and Abyss, he turned on Stevie by chokeslamming him onto the thumbtacks.
Daniels (Daniel Covell) challenged Suicide for the TNA X Division Championship after he saved Suicide from an attack a week prior on "Impact!"; their match was interrupted by two of last week's assailants, the Motor City Machineguns, who were determined to reveal the identity of Suicide, attacked him before fleeing the ring as Daniels pinned his opponent; once he saw a replay of what transpired to have him win the title, he refused to accept the title under the circumstances presented to him; he requested the match to continue, adding an additional five minutes, which expired, leading to Suicide retaining the title.
Following was a second title match for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship, which pitted Angelina Love, the champion, against Awesome Kong. The match was centered around Love running from Kong before being blocked by Kong's manager, Raisha Saeed (Melissa Anderson), which saw Kong beat down on her opponent before the referee was distracted while the champion grabbed a can of hair spray, and expelled the contents into the challenger's eyes before capitalizing on her opponent's compromised state, executing a roll up-style cover to get the pinfall victory. Following the match, an irate Kong would recover, and confront Love before grabbing her, and executing her signature drop, the Implant Buster, driving Love's face into the mat, before the leaving the ring.
Next was the match between Samoa Joe and Kevin Nash. The match fell to the outside with both men jockeying for the control of a steel chair with Joe hitting his opponent in the face, causing him to bleed. After two failed attempts at his signature rear naked choke, the Coquina Clutch, Joe would end up winning the match by applying another choke, a choke with a half nelson hold cinched in. After the victory, he continued to beat on Nash with elbow strikes before several officials came to the ring to break up two.
Main event matches.
The finals for the "Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament" was held at Sacrifice with Beer Money, Inc. against The British Invasion (Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams). It was a physical match that saw all four men perform a plethora of tag team maneuvers and high spots with a highlight being Storm performing a headscissors takedown from the top rope on Williams followed by a top rope body press by Roode to his downed opponent. Beer Money won the match following Roode pinning Williams after the latter was hit in the face with one of the briefcases that The British Invasion had recently commandeered.
The main event followed for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between defending champion, Mick Foley, Kurt Angle, Jeff Jarrett, and Sting. The match quickly turned into a brawl on the outside of the ring and the entrance ramp. After a few minutes of action from Foley, he decided to take a rest, and started doing commentary while all three of his opponents continued to wrestle. Fellow members of the Main Event Mafia, Angle and Sting, would double team Jarrett before a communications breakdown, leading to the two fighting each other. After Sting was taken down, Angle turned his attention to Foley at the announcers table, diving onto him, leading to Foley returning to the ring. Foley would then apply a claw hold to the jaw on both Sting and Jarrett, attempting for a dual submission, which led to a potential dual pin (both men went to the mat with their shoulders down). The match ended when Jarrett dropped Angle from the second turnbuckle with his finishing maneuver, the Stroke, onto a chair, only for Sting to sneak into the ring and pin Angle, winning the match. This made Sting the leader of the Main Event Mafia.
Aftermath.
With Sting the new leader of the Main Event Mafia, he immediately made some changes to the line up of the organization: he would ban Sharmell and Jenna Morasca, then fired Kurt Angle's bodyguards.
Upon winning the "Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament", Team 3D met with Beer Money, Inc. on the May 29 edition of "Impact!" where Robert Roode and James Storm received their check for $100,000, and trophies for winning the tournament; it was subsequently announced that the match guaranteed to the winners for the TNA World Tag Team Championship would take place at TNA's seventh anniversary event, Slammiversary.
The TNA World Heavyweight Championship would still be in Mick Foley's hands as he would defend the annual King of the Mountain match; simultaneously, he would also be lobbying to only have to defend his title once a year.
Continuing their quest to reveal the identity of Suicide, The Motor City Machine Guns and Lethal Consequences would again assault Suicide in the coming weeks until it was announced on the June 4 edition of "Impact!" that all five men would compete in another King of the Mountain match for Slammiversary.
Reception.
The show was given positive feedback from critics. Dave Meltzer, writer of the professional wrestling periodical, The "Wrestling Observer Newsletter", would say multiple times in his pay-per-view report for the show that it, "overachieved", and he gave special attention to the "Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament" finals and the "I quit" match. The only form of criticism he gave the show were some of the illogical booking tactics made by the company. The Pro Wrestling Torch reporter, James Caldwell, reviewed the show, as well, giving it a generally good review, but also criticized the show in a number of spots, specifically the "I quit" match: "Best match of the PPV until the finish with Sharmell-Jenna continuing their feud on PPV TV. Keep it on free TV (if TNA is so adamant about continuing this), but don't put that dumb storyline on pay TV. As usual, TNA tries to find a way out of a stipulation. Sucks to rant on that, because the match was awesome and one of Booker's best performances in years."
A common theme amongst the criticism was the "lack of common sense", as wrestling journalist, Ben Miller, put it. He made particular mention to the World title match, by saying, "...there was no reason for Jarrett, Angle or Foley to attempt to beat Sting. You can win a championship, control of the company, leadership of a powerful faction or... what? If you end Sting’s career do you become six-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion. There is, of course, the argument that by pinning Sting you eliminate a potential rival. I don’t think the crowd bought that argument. The heat was spotty during the match and the lack of a sensible reason for attacking Sting appeared to be a big part of it. TNA Sacrifice 2009 felt flat, but it shouldn’t have. Most everyone worked hard, some angles paid off and some angles left fans intrigued. Those three ingredients usually make for a good show. Instead, one-third of the matches had conceptual problems...".

New Providence, Tennessee

New Providence was a small railroad town in Montgomery County, Tennessee. It was a mostly working class city until about the mid 20th century when it was annexed by the nearby city of Clarksville. 
Nineteenth century.
The nineteenth century saw the advent of the railroad through New Providence and the nearby hubs of Clarksville and Saint Bethlehem. It brought new industry to the town, and a rise in population. Though it did not compare to that of nearby Clarksville, it fed railroads lines that went to St. Louis, Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga, Atlanta, and many other major hubs in the southern United States. During the Civil War, the town was a strategic hub, given its railways and proximity to Fort Donelson in Stewart County. After the war, the town began to decline.
Twentieth century.
The railroads still brought many jobs to the town, but it paled in comparison to many of its neighboring communities. The two world wars and the building of nearby Fort Campbell, saw many young men enlisting in the United States Army. During the 1960s the town was annexed into the city of Clarksville, which now incorporated Clarksville, St. Bethleham, parts of Sango, and other parts of Montgomery County.
Crime.
Since New Providence became part of Clarksville, one of its rising problems was that of rising crime rates and gang enrollment. The area has been known for its notorious incidents of businesses being robbed and burglarized. It has also been known in the local area for its drug and illegal alcohol substances problems. There have been numerous drug bust in the neighborhood, and local police have always had problems with moonshine stills. In recent years it has contributed to the rising murder rate in the Clarksville area, and the Clarksville, TN-KY metropolitan statistical area.

Christian Schoyen

Christian Schoyen (born February 13, 1966) is a headhunter, expert in human behavior and futurist with speciality in human behavior futurology. He has since 1997 been the CEO for a successful international headhunting company that he founded, with offices in the U.S. and Europe.
On December 19, 2013 the parade and block party for the children of Sierra Oeste took place, launching the initiative of Hometown Heroes United, a group with Christian Schoyen as the project director, formed by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and Hometown Heroes to fight crime and improve the conditions for children in poverty. The block party which had Christmas music, free food, gifts and a drawing contest gathered hundreds of children in Sierra Oeste, which is considered to be the most dangerous place to live in Las Vegas. Over several weeks Christian and others involved in the project knocked on every door to get to know the families and better understand what troubles the community. Christian said in an interview with Las Vegas Review Journal;” We want to reduce crime and reach out to the children. We hope to bring a strong community spirit to the area, something that is vital for children to thrive and to break the cycle of violence that has plagued the neighborhood for years and hope we can alter that life path. Transforming a neighborhood known to many as the “baby ghetto” won’t be easy. A drastic situation needs drastic measures."
In 2011, Christian's futuring project; "Las Vegas 2020" was selected for presentation at World Future Society international Conference in Vancouver, Canada. The project which was done in conjunction with futurist Nils Rasmussen introduced a new model for city government, together with a vision of how to ensure optimal allocation of resources to provide a higher quality of life for the citizens of Las Vegas.
He has written several books, this including; Can People Change? - When trapped in a bubble, which has its basis in his 17 year study in human behavior and predictability. His docudrama Living the Dream linking childhood conditioning to adulthood plays an important part of his behavior study. Christian is also the author of the US bestselling book for companies on how to recruit; Secrets of the Executive Search Experts, The Hidden Job Market: Secrets of an International Headhunter, Recruitment in the European Economic Area (EEA): Forecast of Future Labour Market (The Norwegian Government Research Council/ ISBN 978-1-4675-2151-2), How to Get the Job: A Handbook for International Job Seekers and A Second Life: Your Second Chance at Life.
Christian graduated with a BBA from Pacific Lutheran University, Tacoma, WA in 1991 and conducted his ethnic studies at California State University, Northridge.

Historiography of Switzerland

The historiography of Switzerland is the study of the history of Switzerland. Up until the late 20th century, it was largely shaped by the centuries-old traditional account of the founding of the Old Swiss Confederacy through the Federal Charter of 1291 as a defensive alliance of small republics against European tyrants. More recent Swiss scholarship supplements this tradition's emphasis on political and military events with other approaches such as research into Swiss economic history, legal history and social history.
Swiss historiography received substantial public attention in the 1990s, when controversy over Switzerland's conduct during World War II, triggered by a U.S. lawsuit, prompted the Swiss government to commission a much-publicised report by a board of historians.
Early works.
The earliest works of Swiss history are the battle songs and folk songs in which the earliest Confederates celebrated their deeds, as well as the illustrated chronicles written mostly in the 15th to 17th century on behalf of the authorities of the city-states of Berne and Lucerne. While these chronicles were written from the point of view of the individual states, even the earliest did address issues of all-Swiss significance in some detail.
With the introduction of movable type in Europe, chroniclers could reach a wider audience and begin to write about Swiss history as a whole. The 1507 "Chronicle of the Swiss Confederation" by Petermann Etterlin exerted great influence on later writers because, as a printed work, it was the first to be generally available. Moreover, Humanist scholars such as Johannes Stumpf and Aegidius Tschudi connected the history of their time with the Roman era of Switzerland and to the accounts of the Helvetii, giving a greater depth to the emerging discipline of history in Switzerland. 
This development came to a close with Josias Simler's 1576 "De Helvetiorum republica libri duo", a sober account of the Confederacy's constitutional status and historical background. The work remained the definitive account of Swiss political history for centuries – it saw some 30 editions up until the 18th century, and was immediately translated into German and French. The rest of the world learnt of Swiss history essentially through Simler's treatise.
17th and 18th centuries.
As the Swiss city-states grew more stratified and oligarchical, and as confessional, social and political barriers became more pronounced, the 17th century saw a shift of focus in historical writing from the affairs of the Confederacy to that of the individual state. The continuation of the last great work of Swiss humanist historiography, Franz Guilliman's "De rebus Helvetiorum sive antiquitatum", was thwarted by partisan politics. The baroque appetite for "curiosa" was allayed by Matthäus Merian's great engravings.
Historical research bloomed again in the time of the Enlightenment, when as early as with Johann Jakob Wagner's 1680 "Historia naturalis Helvetiae curiosa", the spirit of critical inquiry took hold in Swiss scholarship. Conditions were not optimal – state archives remained mostly closed to private researchers and the "zeitgeist" favoured a heroic interpretation of history in a less than heroic present. Still, the early 18th century saw the first critical editions of ancient sources (by Johann Jakob Bodmer in 1735) and the publication of the first Swiss historical journals ("Helvetische Bibliothek", also by Bodmer, and "Mercure Helvétique", both in 1735). The century's most significant work of historiography was the country's first historical dictionary, the 20-volume "Allgemeines helvetisches eidgenössisches Lexikon" in 20 volumes (1743–63), written by scholars from all cantons and edited by Johann Jakob Leu.
The first comprehensive historiography was Gottlieb Emanuel Haller's six-volume "Bibliothek der Schweizergeschichte" (1785–88). The need for a historical overview was met by François-Joseph-Nicolas d'Alt de Tieffenthal's very patriotic "Histoire des Hélvetiens" (1749–53), Alexander Ludwig von Wattenwyl's prelude to Swiss criticism "Histoire de la Confédération hélvetique" (1754) and Vinzenz Bernhard Tscharner's "Historie der Eidgenossen" (1756–71). These works were complemented by treatises on the early history of Switzerland, the Reformation in Switzerland or Swiss military service abroad, as well as an increasing number of reports by foreign travelers in Switzerland.
All these works, in general, hewed closely to the popular account of the Confederacy's creation as established in the 15th and 16th century. According to that tradition, it was established in 1291 as an alliance between Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden, the result of a patriotic uprising against Habsburg occupation, triggered by William Tell's just tyrannicide of the brutal bailiff Albrecht Gessler. When the Bernese Uriel Freudenberger and Gottlieb Emanuel Haller were the first to publicly question the historicity of Tell – not really believed in any more by Enlightenment-era intellectuals – they triggered a political scandal and caused tensions between Berne and Tell's traditional home state, Uri. Their 1760 book "Der Wilhelm Tell. Ein dänisches Mährgen", in which they showed the Tell saga to be an adaptation of a Danish legend, was banned and burnt in public. As the rationalist Enlightenment gave way to the more emotional period of Romanticism, the questioning of popular heroes grew more unpopular still, and the traditional account of Tell was reestablished for generations by Friedrich Schiller's play "William Tell" of 1804.
19th century.
Building a national history.
The 19th century's most influential work of historiography was Johannes von Müller's epic and lively five-volume "Geschichten Schweizerischer Eidgenossenschaft" (1786–1806). It helped Switzerland, thrown into turmoil by Napoleon's violent overthrow of the "Ancien Régime" and the establishment of the short-lived Helvetic Republic, to find a sense of national identity and to refound the Confederation after Napoleon's fall. 
The work, which did not go beyond the Swabian War of 1499 – Switzerland's war of independence – was soon continued in the works of an entire generation of historians. Robert Glutz von Blotzheim and Johann Jakob Hottinger in the German-speaking part of Switzerland as well as Louis Vuillemin and Charles Monnard in the Romandie translated and extended Müller's work, providing the new federal state founded in 1848 with a reasonably coherent common national history.
Von Müller's work was eventually supplanted by Johannes Dierauer's seminal "Geschichte der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft" (1887–1917, with extensions up until 1974), which remains indispensable to modern research thanks to its thorough critical apparatus.
Popularization of history.
In the period of historicism, learning from this national history became a general preoccupation, and dozens of works of popular history – notably by the educator Heinrich Zschokke and by the liberal historian André Daguet – were published to meet this demand. The democratic reforms of the 18th century caused a broadening of public education and the publication of innumerable historical textbooks. 
Cantonal archives along with the new Federal Archives were opened to researchers, and chairs of Swiss history were established in Swiss universities. The first historical society in Switzerland was founded in 1841.
Publication of official documents.
An important foundation for later research was laid in the later 19th century through the edition and publication of official documents, including those of the Old Confederacy and the Helvetic Republic, in voluminous series whose publication was not completed until 1966. This tradition is being continued in the ongoing publication of Swiss diplomatic archives by several Swiss universities starting in 1979.
Focus on early history.
With the 17th and 18th century seen by later 19th-century historians as uninteresting periods of stagnation, academic interest focused on the early history of Switzerland, whose discovery was aided by new archaeological methods, and, following European trends, on the medieval period and the Reformation. The conservative Roman Catholic cantons – who had been defeated in the 1847 Sonderbund war – also received little attention from scholars situated in the liberal Protestant mainstream of the time.
20th century.
Topical histories.
The early 20th century saw the publication of great topical histories of Switzerland, including Eugen Huber's legal history ("Geschichte und System des schweizerischen Privatrechts", 1893), Andreas Heusler's constitutional history ("Schweizer Verfassungsgeschichte", 1920; supplanted by Hans Conrad Peyer's "Verfassungsgeschichte" of 1978) and Paul Schweizer's diplomatic history ("Geschichte der schweizerischen Neutralität", 1895; continued by Edgar Bonjour from 1946 on).
Shifts in approach.
On the whole, Swiss historiography up until the early 20th century was focused on the political and military history of Switzerland. The liberal, Radical intellectual mainstream, which viewed Swiss history as a steady progression of liberty culminating in the founding of the 1848 federal state, was dominant.
Some academic attention also shifted to the economic and social history of Switzerland, which began to be treated in substantial monographs by William Rappard and Eduard Fueter in the 1910s. These developments, inspired by Anglo-American historiographical trends, were however cut short by the World Wars. Attempts by non-historians including Robert Grimm to write a Socialist history of Switzerland had no impact.
On the other hand, apologists of the "Ancien Régime" such as Gonzague de Reynold, who praised the perceived enlighted authoritarianism of the Old Confederacy, left an imprint on the generally conservative historiography of the post-World War II generation. One historian, Karl Meyer, even attempted to rehabilitate the historicity of the national founding legends in a 1933 work. The early Cold War period's emphasis on "geistige Landesverteidigung" – "intellectual defense of the country" – did also not encourage a re-thinking of Swiss history.
It was only with the societal upheavals associated with the year 1968, which in Switzerland as elsewhere in the West began to move the mainstream of academic thought to the political Left, that the approach of Swiss historians began to shift again. Picking up where Rappard and Fueter had left off, historians of the 1960s and 1970s published large treatises on the social and economic history of Switzerland. Adapting the newer methods of historical research in the United States, the United Kingdom and France, researchers used disciplines such as historical demographics and ecology to support their work. Inspired by the Annales School, the postulate of "total history" – a comprehensive view of history aiming to understand long-term structures instead of explaining the current state of affairs – is now well-established in Swiss historiography.
Contemporary works.
Dierauer's seminal work of 1887–1917 was eventually supplanted as the leading work of Swiss historiography by the "Handbuch der Schweizer Geschichte", a collaborative work of 1972–77, which remains largely rooted in the conservative mainstream of the early 1960s. A historians' "committee for a new history of Switzerland", avowedly following the new "total history" approach, published its three-volume "Nouvelle histoire de la Suisse et des Suisses" in 1982/83; a condensed one-volume edition ("Geschichte der Schweiz und der Schweizer", last reprinted 2006) is currently the standard university textbook of Swiss history.
The principal ongoing project of Swiss historiography is the Historical Dictionary of Switzerland, which as of 2008 has reached its seventh volume (letters J to L). It is also accessible online, as are more and more topical historical dictionaries, including SIKART (a biographical dictionary of Swiss artists) and the Culinary Heritage of Switzerland project (a historical encyclopedia of Swiss food).

Doug Ring with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948

Doug Ring was a member of Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team which toured England in 1948. Bradman's men went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet "The Invincibles".
A leg spinner, Ring was not prominent in the team's success. Regarded as the last bowler to be selected for the team, Ring played in only the Fifth Test, taking one wicket for 44 runs (1/44) for the match and scoring nine runs in his only innings after replacing off spinner Ian Johnson, who was dropped for poor form. Along with Ron Hamence and Colin McCool, neither of whom played in a Test during the tour, Ring called himself "ground staff" because of the paucity of the trio's on-field duties in the major matches and they often sang ironic songs about their status.
For the entire tour, Ring took 60 first-class wickets at a bowling average of 21.81, the most expensive among Australia's frontline bowlers. As England agreed to have a new ball available 55 overs after the start of each innings in the Tests—more frequently than usual—fast bowling dominated over spin, and Ring was used primarily in the non-Test tour matches. Outside the Tests, only Bill Johnston bowled more overs, and Ring was used to relieve the workload on Bradman's pace spearheads to keep them fresh for the Tests. Ring scored 150 first-class runs at a batting average of 16.66 during the tour, and a top-score of 53 was his only effort beyond 50.
Background.
Ring made his Test debut in last international match of the 1947–48 Australian season, the Fifth Test against India. Australia rested a few of its players and some fringe cricketers such as Ring and Sam Loxton were given a debut so that their ability could be evaluated before the tour of England. Ring took six wickets for the match and was selected for the tour along with Loxton, who scored 80.
Early tour.
Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Ring was omitted from this match, despite having replaced Colin McCool to make his Test debut in the fifth and final match against India in Australia during the 1947–48 season that preceded the tour of England; Ring had taken six wickets for 120 runs (6/120). Fellow leg spinner McCool and off spinner Ian Johnson—who had been regular Test players since World War II—were the two slow bowlers picked as Australia started their campaign with an innings victory.
Ring was called into the team for the second tour match against Leicestershire. He made two runs with the bat before being run out as Australia ended on 448. Ring took two top order wickets to leave the hosts at 3/56 before returning to take three late wickets as Leicestershire lost their last four wickets without addition to be all out for 130. Ring ended with 5/45. Made to follow on, Leicestershire scored 147 and lost by an innings. Ring failed to add to his wicket tally in the county's second innings, conceding 26 runs. Ring was rested for the next match against Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. It was the closest Australia came to defeat on the tour, as they scraped home by four wickets in a low scoring affair. The Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval, and Ring made two in the tourists' 632. He then took 3/34 in the first innings, removing Arthur McIntyre, Alec Bedser and Jim Laker. He bowled five wicketless overs in the second innings as Surrey were defeated by an innings. Ring then took 1/18 and 0/52 from a total of 44 overs as Australia amassed 4/414 declared and defeated Cambridge University by an innings.
In the following match, Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs, its largest winning margin for the summer. On the first day, Australia set a world record by scoring 721, the most first-class runs made in a single day's play, but Ring was unable to contribute to the surfeit of scoring, making only one. He bowled 18 overs and conceded a total of 35 runs without success as the hosts were bowled out for 83 and 187. This was followed by another innings victory, this time over Oxford University. After having failed to score more than two runs in any of his first three innings of the tour, Ring came to the wicket at 7/317 and scored 53, adding 87 runs in partnership with fellow Victorian Sam Loxton before being bowled. After Australia were out for 431, Ring took a match total of 1/51, removing Geoffrey Keighley as the hosts made 185 and 156.
The next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests,N- and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance for both teams to gain a psychological advantage. At this point of the tour, Ring had only taken ten wickets at an average of 28.30, while McCool had taken 17 at 14.35. McCool retained the first-choice leg spinner's position and took 4/35 as Australia won by an innings.
Ring was rested for Australia'a first non-victory of the tour, a rain-affected draw against Lancashire. He returned for the match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, which was also drawn. Ring took 2/31 in the first innings, both of his victims being stumped, as the hosts made 179, before making an unbeaten nine in Australia's reply of 400. He then shouldered the heaviest workload as Nottinghamshire made 8/299 in the second innings, the highest score against the Australians thus far on the tour. Ring bowled 43 overs and took 4/104. He removed Joe Hardstaff junior, who had made the first century against Australia for the season, triggering a collapse that saw the loss of four wickets for 27 runs to leave the hosts at 8/289. He also dismissed future Test batsman Reg Simpson for 70. The hosts were 32 runs short of making Australia bat again, but held on for a draw as time ran out.
Against Hampshire, Ring took 1/19 as the home team made 195 after being put into bat on a drying pitch. He made a duck as Australia collapsed to 117 to trail by 78 runs, the first time the tourists had conceded a first innings lead during the English summer. Ring was not required to bat in the Australian second innings, as Hampshire were bowled out for 103 in 42.5 overs and Australia then reached their target of 182 to win by eight wickets. Ring had a final chance to push for Test selection in the innings win over Sussex, the last match before the First Test. He bowled only two wicketless overs as the pacemen skittled the hosts for 86, and did not bat as Australia amassed 5/549 declared. He then took three consecutive wickets as Sussex fell from 5/98 to 8/109 before eventually being bowled out for 138. Ring ended with 3/42 from 13 overs.
Test omission.
Ring's performances were not enough for him to take McCool's place in Bradman's first-choice team. Instead, Bill Johnston, who had taken 10/40 against Yorkshire and 11/117 against Hampshire on damp surfaces, was given the place on the opening morning of the First Test when rain appeared likely. Johnston then took nine wickets in Australia's victory, cementing his position in the team. This left Ring jostling with the other spinners—Johnson and McCool—for one spot in the Test team.
After the First Test, Ring returned to action as Australia completed an innings victory over Northamptonshire. He took 1/31 in the hosts' first innings of 119, before making an unbeaten 16 in partnering McCool in an unbroken stand of 39 as Australia declared at 8/352. In the second innings, he took four of the last five wickets and ended with 4/31 as Northamptonshire collapsed from 5/142 to be all out for 169. This was followed by a drawn match against Yorkshire, in which Ring scored three runs and was not asked to bowl in the first innings. Yorkshire were bowled out for 206 from 90.1 overs; Bradman called on Ernie Toshack and Johnston to bowl 81.1 overs and did not entrust the other bowlers with substantial work. Ring then took 1/22 in the second innings as the match petered out into a draw.
Ring was overlooked for the Second Test at Lord's as Bradman retained the same XI, despite the incumbent spinner Johnson managing only 1/85 in the First Test. Australia won convincingly by 409 runs. The next match was against Surrey, starting the day after the finish of the Test. Ring took 3/51 from 21.2 overs in the first innings, leading the way in terms of wickets and overs; most of the Test bowlers were given a light workload. He then contributed an unbeaten 15 in Australia's first innings of 389. After Australia took a first innings lead of 168, Ring bowled another 24 overs in the second innings and took 1/54. He twice dismissed Jack Parker, who had top-scored in each innings with 76 and 81. Australia then chased down the 122 runs for victory in less than an hour, to complete a 10-wicket win.
In the match against Gloucestershire immediately before the Third Test, Ring did not bat as Australia reached 7/774 declared, which was their highest score of the tour and which underpinned an innings victory. Ring took two wickets in the space of three runs, including Test batsman Charlie Barnett, to end with 2/83 in 25 overs as the hosts made 279. After stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett enforced the follow on—Bradman had rested himself—Ring removed Test batsmen Barnett and George Emmett to leave Gloucestershire at 2/20. After resting he resumed bowling with the score at 4/93 and took three more wickets, as the hosts fell to 9/109 and then 132 all out. Ring took 5/47 and bowled the most overs (25) in the second innings. Johnson, however, took 11/100 in the match and retained his place in the team for the Third Test at Old Trafford. The Test was drawn amid inclement weather.
Ring then played against Middlesex in Australia's only match before the Fourth Test. He took one wicket in each innings for a match total of 2/57. After only scoring two in the first innings, Ring opened the batting with McCool in the second innings, with a target of only 22 runs. They promptly reached the target without loss, with Ring unbeaten on 15. This was not enough for Ring to force his way into the team for the Fourth Test at Headingley. Australia persisted with the same bowling attack and posted 3/404 in the second innings, setting a world record for the highest successful run-chase to win a Test. Former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised the Australians for using only one spinner, pointing out that he and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, a left-arm wrist spinner, had taken 17 wickets between them during the last Anglo-Australian Test at Headingley in 1938. O'Reilly cited the 1934 Headingley Test the same venue in 1934 in which he and Clarrie Grimmett had significant success for Australia, and said that at least one of McCool or Ring, should have played alongside Johnson. England had been at 2/423 in their first innings, before collapsing to be 496 all out; O'Reilly blamed Australia's lack of early success on the absence of a leg spinner, attributing England's collapse to inept batting.
Immediately after the Headingley Test, Ring scored four as Australia amassed 456 against Derbyshire. He bowled the most overs in the first innings, taking 3/73 from 24 overs as the hosts made 240. He then took 0/23 from six overs after Australia enforced the follow on and ultimately won the match by an innings. In the next match against Glamorgan, Ring led the bowling with 3/34, including the wicket of opposition captain Wilf Wooller as the hosts folded for 197. Ring did not bat, as rain ended the match early, with Australia's score at 3/215. Ring was then rested for the match against Warwickshire, which Australia won by nine wickets.
Bradman recalled Ring as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. Ring scored 17 not out as Australia made 321; he then dismissed Test players Ken Cranston (who was captaining Lancashire) and Dick Pollard, to end with 2/25 in the first innings. In the county's second innings Ring bowled 22 of the 57 overs during which Australia reduced Lancashire to 7/199 before time ran out. He took 2/88, including the wicket of Cranston for the second time. In a non-first-class match against Durham, the last fixture before the Fifth Test, Ring made an unbeaten single as Australia scored 282. He then took 1/24 as the hosts fell to 5/73 in their first innings, before rain washed out the match.
Fifth Test.
After taking only seven wickets at 61.00 in the first four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval; Ring replaced him as the team's spinner. English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, which was regarded as a surprising move by the majority of the press corps. Precipitation in the previous week caused an extremely wet outfield, which meant that the Test could not start until midday had passed. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton speculated that the Australians would have bowled if they had won the toss.
Along with the effects of the rain on the pitch, the humid conditions assisted the Australian fast bowlers, who were able to make the ball bounce at variable heights. Led by Lindwall, who took 6/20, Australia skittled England for 52, and Ring did not get a chance to bowl. Ring then made nine before being caught by Jack Crapp in the slips as Australia replied with 389. England started their second innings 337 runs in arrears late on day two and resumed at 1/54 the next morning. During the first session, Ring bowled a tidy spell of 13 overs as Denis Compton and Len Hutton added only 67 runs for the session. Ring did not bowl consistently or accurately, and although the batsman hit him regularly, they did not place their shots, which often went to the fielders. There were four men in the off side ring and they had much work to do as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly. The English batsmen progressed steadily although Ring had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton. Later in the day, Ring dismissed debutant Allan Watkins for two to take his only wicket of the match. Watkins lofted a delivery from Ring to the leg side straight into the hands of Hassett, who did not need to move from his position on the boundary, leaving England at 6/167. The hosts were eventually bowled out early on the fourth morning for 188, sealing defeat by an innings and 149 runs. Ring had taken 1/44 after sending down the most overs in the innings (28), including 13 maidens.
Later tour matches.
After the Fifth Test seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia rested Ring for the match against Kent, which Australia won by an innings. This was followed by a game against the Gentlemen of England, the leading amateurs in the country. Ring was not required to bat as Australia amassed 5/610 before declaring. He then bowled the most overs in the first innings, sending down 25.3 and taking the wickets of English Test batsmen Bill Edrich, Trevor Bailey and Freddie Brown. Ring ended with 3/74 as the hosts were bowled out for 245. Australia enforced the follow on and Ring again shouldered the heaviest workload. He removed Reg Simpson to break the opening stand of 60. The Gentlemen progressed to 3/217 before Ring dismissed Edrich for 128, followed by George Mann for a duck without further addition to the score. Ring then bowled Yardley and dismissed Wilf Wooller soon after, leaving the hosts at 7/240; they were eventually all out for 284, which sealed an innings victory for Australia. Ring ended with 5/70 from 32 overs. The following match against Somerset followed a similar pattern. Ring did not bat as Australia declared at 5/560. He then took 2/17 in the first innings and was not required to bowl in the second innings as the hosts collapsed for 115 and 71 to cede another innings victory.
Ring was rested for the match against the South of England. Australia declared at 7/522 before the hosts made 298; rain ended the match before the second innings could start. Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the previous Australian tour of England in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play for the hosts. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team. He made only one change from the team that won the Fifth Test, dropping Ring for Johnson. Australia led by 312 runs on the first innings before persistent rain ended the match.
The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first, Ring made an unbeaten three as Australia scored 236. He bowled five overs without success in the first innings, before removing four of the first five batsmen in the second innings and ending with 4/20. Scotland made 85 and 111 to lose by an innings. In the second match, Ring was the costliest bowler in the first innings, conceding 42 runs without success in Scotland's 178. After Australia declared at 6/407, Ring took the leading figures of 4/30, including the wickets of both openers as Australia ended the tour with another innings triumph.
Role.
Although the 1948 tour of England was an unprecedented triumph for the Australians, Ring's leg spin was not prominent in the success. He jostled with McCool and Johnson for a position as Bradman selected only one specialist spinner in the Tests. Headlined by Lindwall, Miller and Johnston, the faster bowlers dominated the bowling attack. With a new ball allowed at intervals of 55 overs in Tests, a period that usually elapsed sooner than the 200 runs stipulated under the usual rule of the time, spinners were given few opportunities and made little impact in the big matches. Bradman and his fellow tour selectors—vice-captain Lindsay Hassett and Arthur Morris—picked a pace-dominated attack to exploit the more frequently shiny ball, as a new ball swings and seams more for fast bowlers, while slower bowlers can impart more spin with a worn ball. In its summary of the tour, "Wisden" said that Ring "was never a trump card in the pack". Such was the strength of the bowling that Ring's 60 first-class wickets at an average of 21.81 made him the most expensive of the regular bowlers on the tour. Among the seven frontline bowlers, Ring's strike rate of 54.26 was the second least incisive and his economy rate of 40.20 was the second most expensive. Although McCool was less economical, he had the second highest strike rate, and while Toshack had the worst strike rate, he was the second most economical of the Australians in the first-class fixtures.
Ring did most of his work in the non-Test first-class matches, in which he sent down 3,088 deliveries. This was second only to Johnston, who bowled 3,251. In contrast, Lindwall and Miller sent down only 2,105 and 1,749 deliveries outside the Tests respectively, as Bradman sought to preserve them for hostile bursts with the new ball against England. Along with Lindwall, Ring was the equal third highest wicket-taker in first-class matches excluding the Tests, with 59 scalps, doing a large part of the work in the county matches so that the leading bowlers could conserve energy for the Tests.
Ring had limited opportunities with the bat. Along with Toshack and Johnston, he invariably batted in the bottom three positions.N- This was because Australia's other frontline bowlers tended to be capable with the bat; Lindwall, Miller, and McCool all made Test centuries and more than nine triple-figure first-class scores, with the latter pair averaging over 30 in Tests. Johnson passed fifty on 21 occasions in his first-class career, six of them in Tests. The strength of the batting side meant that Ring batted only 14 times in his 19 first-class matches on the tour, as Australia often batted only once and won by an innings, and several times declared their first innings closed before Ring could bat. Ring scored 150 runs at 16.66, an aggregate and average better than only Toshack's. He passed 50 only once, and his tour batting average was lower than his career benchmark of 23.25. Ring also took 12 catches.
Ring and fellow fringe members of the squad McCool and Ron Hamence, would refer themselves as the "ground-staff", as it was unlikely that the tour selectors would include them in the Test team during the tour. The trio were known to sing ironic songs about the paucity of their on-field duties during the tour.

Slammiversary (2009)

Slammiversary Seven was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), which took place on June 21, 2009 at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan. It was the seventh event under the Slammiversary chronology and used to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the promotion. There were seven matches on the card.
The main event for the show was annually-held King of the Mountain match (KOTM) for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship which saw Kurt Angle defeat Mick Foley, Jeff Jarrett, Samoa Joe, and A.J. Styles. For the first time, the undercard for the event also featured another KOTM for the TNA X Division Championship having champion Suicide retain over Consequences Creed, Jay Lethal, Chris Sabin, and Alex Shelley. Other matches featured include: Robert Roode and James Storm (known as Beer Money, Inc.) versus Team 3D for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, Angelina Love versus Tara for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship, Daniels wagering his position in the company against a returning Shane Douglas, Abyss and Taylor Wilde fighting Raven and Daffney in a Monster's Ball Mixed Tag Team match, and Sting versus Matt Morgan.
Storylines.
Slammiversary featured seven professional wrestling matches and one pre-show match that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.
The main rivalry heading into Slammiversary was the annually held King of the Mountain match (KOTM). The KOTM involves five competitors fighting to gain a pinfall or submission to be allowed to climb a ladder and hang a championship belt above the ring to win. Mick Foley was the first competitor in the match as he was the TNA World Heavyweight Champion heading into the show. On the May 29 edition of "Impact!", TNA's primary television program, Foley announced that there would be a series of qualifying matches to determine the other four competitors starting that night. The first match saw Jeff Jarrett defeat Eric Young, then, later on the same edition of "Impact", A.J. Styles defeated Daniels. The following week on "Impact!" Samoa Joe qualified for the match by defeating Kevin Nash. The final competitor was determined to be Kurt Angle the next week after defeating Sting.
Another rivalry involving the tag team division was between TNA World Tag Team Champions Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon) and Beer Money, Inc., Robert Roode and James Storm. At Sacrifice, Beer Money won the Team 3D Invitational Tag Team tournament by defeating The British Invasion (Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams) gaining a TNA World Tag Team Championship match.
The main rivalry from the women's division was between TNA Women's Knockout Champion Angelina Love and Tara. On the May 28 episode of "TNA Impact!", Love expressed her perceived dominance in the division, only for Tara to interfere in the proclamation, leading to a series of assaults until it was announced on the June 11 edition of "Impact!" that the title would be contested between the two.
During Daniels' match with Styles on the May 29 edition of "Impact!", Shane Douglas, who was making his return with the company, interfered during the match, assaulting him with a chain, causing him to lose the match. The animosity would progress the following week with Douglas explaining his resentment towards Daniels due to the fact Daniels was given an opportunity to return rather than him. Daniels gave rebuttal of challenging Douglas for a match at Slammiversary with Daniels' contract with the company being held up and given to the winner. On the June 18 edition of "Impact!", Douglas accepted.
Another feud being represented at Slammiversary was the conflict between Abyss and Dr. Stevie and his associates. For several months prior to the show, Abyss had been seeking storyline therapy from Stevie, only to have revealed Stevie's abusive treatments towards Abyss. After a match between Taylor Wilde and, an associate of Stevie, Daffney at Sacrifice, Abyss would assault his therapist, leading to Stevie, Daffney, and another associate in Raven, apprehending Abyss and Wilde leading to the announcement of an intergender tag team match pitting Abyss and Wilde against Raven and Daffney with a Monster's Ball stipulation.
Event.
Pre-show match.
Prior to the show airing live on pay-per-view, a pre-show match that aired on TV and online had the team of Eric Young and Rhino against The British Invasion (Doug Williams and Brutus Magnus) in a tag team match was shown. Young would leave his partner by walking out on him during the match, leading to Williams and Magnus beating down on their lone opponent until Rhino's student, Jesse Neal, put himself in the match to fill the role of Rhino's partner. The team would be defeated by the Invasion after Neal was pinned by Magnus following a bearhug hold / diving European uppercut combination.
Preliminary matches.
The show started with the King of the Mountain match for the TNA X Division Championship. The four challengers- Jay Lethal, Consequences Creed, Alex Shelley, and Chris Sabin -initially attacked the champion, Suicide, in order to gain the upper hand. When the ladder was introduced to be used as a weapon against him, Suicide knocked the ladder back, incapacitating his opponents, before pinning Lethal. As per match rules, Suicide was now eligible to win the match suspending the belt above the ring, and Lethal would have to spend time in the penalty box. Once all five men became eligible to win the match, Sabin grabbed the title to suspend it above the ring only to have Suicide head him off. This was followed by a plethora of spots before Suicide was able to obtain the belt himself, only to have Lethal push him off the ladder he was climbing, having him land on the penalty box. Shelley would then obtain the belt before Suicide would run and jump to his opponent climbing the ladder, applying a facelock and dropping Shelley down with a cutter before recovering, grabbing the title, and hanging it over the ring to win the match.
Following was Daniels wrestling Douglas for his position in the company. The match started with both men getting quick assaults on each other until Douglas would slide out of the ring to recuperate as Daniels would ascend to the top rope, springboard off of it, and connect with a moonsault to his opponent on the floor of the arena. When the match returned to ring, Daniels would catch his opponent with a back heel trip and clothesline known as the STO before jumping to the top rope and connecting with another moonsault to get the pinfall victory.
Angelina Love would defend the TNA Women's Knockout Championship next against Tara. The match started with Tara beating down the champion; once Tara was about to win, Love's associate, Velvet Sky, would use hairspray to blind Tara before Love took her down with a facebuster, called Lights Out, to retain the title.
Abyss and Taylor Wilde's Monster's Ball match against Raven and Daffney started with Abyss attacking Daffney before throwing her onto Raven and Dr. Stevie, who was in their corner; this was followed by Wilde diving onto her three adversaries. The women would proceed to brawl their way to the entrance ramp, with Wilde performing another dive onto Daffney, as Abyss would retrieve a bag of thumbtacks, spilling its contents onto the mat. This would lead to the women returning to the ring for Wilde to throw her opponent onto them. The finish of the match came when Raven hit his opponent with a steel chair followed by a DDT, only to have Abyss recover and drop Raven onto the tacks with his finishing move, the Black Hole Slam, before pinning him.
Sting made a challenge to Matt Morgan, guaranteeing him a position in his contingency, The Main Event Mafia, if he were to win. The match was fought with both men exchanging strikes before Morgan would physically dominate his opponent. As Morgan went to tackle Sting in the corner, he was countered by Sting getting behind with a facelock, and driving his head to the mat with his Scorpion Death Drop before getting the pinfall victory.
Main event matches.
The main event followed for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Before the match started, Samoa Joe would assault rival, Kurt Angle, sending him straight to the match's penalty box. Jeff Jarrett became the first person to qualify for winning the match officially by pinning Mick Foley, who, once out of the penalty box, was placed back in by Joe, who choked him unconscious with his rear naked choke. The match would feature a plethora of high spots including A.J. Styles springboarding off the top rope to execute a dropkick to Foley and Jarrett as they climbed a ladder. Foley and Styles would eventually make their way to the top of the penalty box before the former threw off his opponent with a hip toss. The match ended following Styles preventing Angle from climbing the ladder to hang the belt before attempting the feat himself; Joe stopped him with a powerbomb off of the ladder. Joe made his attempt to win the match while Angle himself was climbing opposite of him. Just as he was about to hang the belt, he handed it to Angle, allowing him to win the match and the title.
Aftermath.
On the edition of "Impact!" following Slammiversary, the motives of the end of the TNA World Heavyweight Championship match came to light. Kurt Angle had hired Samoa Joe to regulate the match to insure Angle's victory with no one the wiser. Joe had subsequently joined The Main Event Mafia, and Angle claimed to be the leader of the group.
Reception.
The show was generally positive by many critics. Wade Keller of the online wrestling newsletter, Pro Wrestling Torch, expressed favorable comments for the show in the X Division King of the Mountain match, saying the competitors, "delivered supreme athleticism and creativity". Dave Meltzer, journalist of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, gave a live match-by-match report of the show; he praised the show in general, specifically the TNA World Tag Team Championship, as well as feeling the Monster's Ball match was good for a "weapons match".
The common criticism from writers was that the wrestling on the show was merely above average and not really memorable. Wade Keller gave his opinion on the show by saying the main event will not be remembered and believed the swerve in the ending was way to have the match to be remembered.

John Raphael (sportsman)

John Edward Raphael (30 April 1882 – 11 June 1917) was a Belgian born English sportsman who was capped nine times for England at rugby union and played first-class cricket with Surrey.
Biography.
Educated at Merchant Taylors, Raphael won his first cap in 1902 when England took on Wales in the Home Nations Championship. A centre, winger or full-back, he also played in the 1905 and 1906 Championships as well as in Test matches against both France and New Zealand. The only points of his career came through a try which he scored in 1906 when playing Scotland. He captained the 1910 British Lions tour to Argentina, which included of the South American nation's inaugural Test match.
Raphael, who was Jewish, played his cricket as a specialist batsman and most of his appearances at first-class level were for either Surrey or Oxford University. He also played first-class matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club, Gentlemen of England, London County and an England XI amongst others.
Four of Raphael's five centuries were scored for Oxford University, including his career best score of 201 which he made against Yorkshire, who had the bowling of Wilfred Rhodes at their disposal. It remains the only double hundred to be made by an Oxford cricketer against Yorkshire. His only century for Surrey came in the 1904 County Championship, which he captained his county for much of, scoring 111 against Worcestershire.
A part-time bowler, his three first-class wickets were of Samuel Coe, Lord Dalmeny and Test cricketer John King.
In World War I Raphael served with the King's Royal Rifle Corps as a Lieutenant and died of wounds in 1917 at the Battle of Messines, while fighting in the country of his birth.

<doc id="20824677" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20824677" title="Colin McCool with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948">
Colin McCool with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948

Colin McCool was a member of Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948. Bradman’s men were undefeated in their 34 matches and this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet "The Invincibles". 
A frontline leg spinner and middle-order batsman, McCool was not prominent in the team's success. Although McCool started his Test career strongly, his form began to decline during the previous Australian season. After starting the tour in Bradman's first-choice team, a bloodied callus on his spinning finger troubled McCool. This prevented him from bowling for prolonged periods, and along with Ron Hamence, he was one of two squad members who did not play a Test on tour. Along with Doug Ring, the trio called themselves "ground staff" because of the paucity of their on-field duties in the major matches and they often sang ironic songs about their status. 
During the tour, McCool took 57 first-class wickets at a bowling average of 17.82; he was the fifth most prolific wicket-taker and had the fourth best average among Australia's seven frontline bowlers. With England agreeing to have a new ball available after every 55 overs, more frequently than the old rule of replacing the ball after every 200 runs, fast bowling dominated over spin. As a result, McCool did not play in the Tests, but was used heavily in the tour matches so the leading pacemen could conserve their energy for the important matches. Outside the Tests, McCool had the fourth heaviest workload among the regular bowlers, although overall, he delivered the least overs because of his injured finger. McCool took five wickets in an innings three times, his best return being 7/78 against Cambridge University. 
Although McCool also played as a frontline batsman during his career, his performances during the tour were far below his usual standards, scoring only 306 runs at a batting average of 20.40 with three half-centuries. However, he remained prominent with his fielding, taking 20 catches in 17 matches.
Background.
Following the resumption of cricket after World War II, McCool had started his Test career strongly. After making his debut in a one-off Test against New Zealand in 1945–46, he played in all five Tests against England during the 1946–47 home season, scoring 272 runs at an average of 54.40 and taking 18 wickets at just over 27 apiece. "Wisden" said his batting featured "wristy cuts" and "vigorous hooks", adding that there were "few better players of spin bowling on a difficult pitch". "Wisden" judged his slow and loopy leg spin "a clever mixture of leg-breaks and googlies". However, when India toured Australia for the first time in 1947–48, McCool played in three Tests without much success, scoring only 46 runs and taking only four wickets. As a result, he was dropped for the last Test.
Early tour.
Nevertheless, McCool gained selection as part of Australian team to tour England in 1948 under Donald Bradman. Australia had traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the opening match of the tour, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Although he was only selected sporadically during the preceding Test series against India, McCool was chosen alongside off spinner Ian Johnson and appeared to be part of Bradman's Test plans. The home side batted first and McCool took his maiden wicket on English soil, having former England captain Bob Wyatt stumped by fellow Queenslander Don Tallon. He removed Wyatt's replacement for a duck without further addition to the score and ended with 2/38 as the home side were dismissed for 233. McCool returned the favour during Australia's innings. Coming in at No. 5, he made a fifth ball duck and was part of a middle-order collapse that saw Australia lose 4/38 before steadying to declare at 8/462. In the second innings, McCool did the bulk of the damage, taking four of the five first wickets—two of whom were stumped by Tallon—to leave the hosts at 5/122 before Australia completed an innings victory. McCool had been the most successful bowler in the opening match. 
McCool was rested for the second tour match against Leicestershire, which Australia won by an innings. The next match against Yorkshire—on a damp pitch favourable to slower bowling—was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour. McCool made three in the first innings as Australia replied to Yorkshire's 71 with 101. After the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 5/20 in pursuit of 60 for victory when McCool arrived at the crease. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia effectively only had four wickets in hand and faced the prospect of losing to an English county for the first time since 1912. McCool scored five before hitting a long hop back to left-arm spinner Johnny Wardle to leave Australia at 6/31. However, Australia lost no further batsmen and scraped home by four wickets. McCool’s leg spin was used as Keith Miller and Bill Johnston bowled almost unchanged for the entire match. 
McCool was rested as the Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval and won by an innings. McCool returned for the next match, which was Cambridge University. After going wicketless for 31 runs in the first innings, he did not bat as Australia declared at 4/414 in reply to the hosts’ 167. In the second innings, McCool took the first four wickets—including two stumpings by Ron Saggers—to leave the hosts at 4/73. He returned to take three more wickets and end with 7/78 as Cambridge fell for 196 to lose by an innings and 51 runs. 
McCool was rested as Australia defeated Essex by an innings and 451 runs, its largest winning margin for the summer. During this match, the other batsmen set a world record by scoring 721 on the first day, the most first-class runs compiled in a day’s play. He returned for the innings victory against Oxford University. McCool made his first substantial contribution with the bat, coming in at 5/214 and scoring 50 in a 91-run partnership with Loxton as Australia made 431. He removed Indian Test cricketer Abdul Hafeez Kardar in the first innings, before taking 3/29 in the second as Australia won by an innings. 
The next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage, with Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Bill Edrich—three of England's top four batsmen—all playing. Batting at No. 8, McCool made a duck as Australia collapsed late in their innings, losing 5/54 to be bowled out for 552. He was not required to bowl in the first innings as the three pacemen Ray Lindwall, Ernie Toshack and Miller skittled England for 189. McCool was given the shortest spell of the frontline bowlers in the second innings as the fast bowlers again made early inroads. He sent down 7.2 overs, and disposed of the tail, removing the last four wickets, including MCC and England captain Norman Yardley. McCool ended with 4/35 as the MCC lost their last four wickets for 28 to be all out for 205, giving Australia a victory by an innings and 158 runs. 
Four matches followed the MCC fixture before the First Test at Trent Bridge. McCool was rested for the first of these against Lancashire at Manchester, a rain-affected draw that was Australia's first non-victory of the season. He returned for the following match against Nottinghamshire, which was drawn, but had little success, taking a total of 0/68. He failed to maximise his promotion to No. 4, making only 17 as Australia scored 400 in their only innings. McCool did not get any more opportunities to push for selection, as he was rested from the next two matches against Hampshire and Sussex. Australia won the former by eight wickets after conceding a first innings lead for the first time on the tour, before winning the second by an innings by 325 runs.
Test omission.
Bill Johnston—a left arm bowler who could bowl both pace and spin—was not initially in Bradman's plan for the First Test at Trent Bridge. However, Bradman changed his mind on the morning when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket; he had previously taken match-winning figures of 10/40 and 11/117 against Yorkshire and Hampshire respectively on rain-affected surfaces. In addition, McCool had been struggling with an injury on his spinning finger, and Bradman was worried McCool would not have the endurance required for a five-day Test, which was two days longer than a normal tour match. Johnston's inclusion at the expense of McCool was the only difference between the team for the First Test and those against Worcestershire and the MCC. Johnston subsequently cemented his position by taking nine wickets in the match—the most among the Australians. Johnson, the only specialist spinner chosen, took 1/85. 
Between Tests, McCool was recalled for the match against Northamptonshire. He took 1/19 in the first innings before coming in at the fall of the fifth wicket and scoring an unbeaten 50 as Australia declared at 8/352. McCool only bowled three overs in the second innings and went wicketless as Australia won by an innings. Johnson, the incumbent Test spinner, took 4/59. In the second match before the Second Test, against Yorkshire, McCool made only four and seven not out before Australia declared in their second innings. After not being bowled in the first innings, he took 2/33 in the last hour of the match as Yorkshire ended at 4/85 to secure a draw. McCool was overlooked for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded the same XI that had won the First Test by eight wickets. Bradman's men went on to complete a crushing win by 409 runs, and Johnson registered match figures of 3/75. 
The next match was against Surrey and started the day after the Second Test. McCool bowled only three overs in the first innings, before contributing 26 with the bat in Australia's reply. After the tourists had taken a first innings lead of 168, McCool bowled heavily as Bradman eased the workload on his Test players in the second innings. McCool removed Surrey's top three batsmen—two of them stumped by Saggers—to leave the hosts at 3/94. A 107-run seventh wicket stand saw Surrey recover to 6/267 before McCool took three of the last four wickets to end the innings at 289. McCool ended with 6/113 from 45.5 overs, having bowled approximately 40% of the overs. Australia chased down the 122 runs required for victory in less than hour to complete a 10-wicket win. 
In the following match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test, McCool came to the crease late on the first day with Australia at 5/529. Unbeaten on eight at stumps, with the score at 5/560, he continued the next morning and proceeded to add 140 for the sixth wicket with Loxton, before falling for 76, his highest first-class score of the season. Australia reached 7/774 declared, its highest of the tour, laying the foundation for an innings victory. McCool bowled a total of 19 overs to end with 0/51, while Johnson took 11/100 and retained his place for the Third Test at Old Trafford, which was drawn amid inclement weather. 
The match against Middlesex was the only fixture between the Tests. McCool toiled for 18 overs before snaring the last two wickets to end with 2/54 after the hosts had batted first. He made a duck as Australia scored 317 to take a 114-run lead. In the second innings, McCool took 3/54 including the wickets of John Dewes and Leslie Compton as the hosts lost 4/22 to be all out for 135. With only 22 runs needed for victory, Bradman let McCool and fellow leg spinner Doug Ring open the batting. The pair duly saw Australia home without losing a wicket, with McCool on seven. 
McCool was again overlooked for the Fourth Test at Headingley, in which Australia posted 3/404 in the second innings to win by seven wickets, setting a world record for the highest successful run-chase in a Test. Immediately after the Headingley Test, McCool made 31—batting at No. 8—as Australia amassed 456 against Derbyshire. After taking 0/45 in the first innings, McCool bounced back as Australia enforced the follow on. A 100-run second wicket partnership by Arnold Townsend and Denis Smith took Derbyshire to 1/110. McCool removed Townsend for 46 and quickly dismissed the next two batsmen to leave Derbyshire at 4/116. He returned with the score at 5/163 and took three further wickets in close succession to dismiss the hosts for 182, sealing victory by an innings. McCool ended with 6/77 from 29 overs. 
In the next match against Glamorgan, McCool neither batted nor bowled in a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. In the following fixture against Warwickshire, McCool did not bowl in the first innings and scored 19, before taking 4/56 in the second innings, helping to set up a win by nine wickets. McCool was then rested as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. He returned for the non-first-class match against Durham, and came to the crease with Australia in trouble at 3/22. He top-scored with 64 to help Australia reach 282 all out. McCool took 1/17 as the hosts fell to 5/73 in reply when rain ended the match after the first day. After taking only seven wickets at 61.00 in the first four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval. However, it was fellow leg spinner Ring and not McCool who was called in. Australia crushed England by an innings and 149 runs to take the series 4–0.
Later tour matches.
Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and McCool made a duck in their total of 361. He then took 2/13 as the hosts were skittled for 51. Forced to follow on, Kent were bowled out for 124 to lose by an innings, but not before attacking McCool and taking 42 runs from his five wicketless overs. In the next match against the Gentlemen of England, McCool was rested as Australia amassed 5/610 and won by an innings. He returned for the next match against Somerset. Promoted to fourth drop, McCool could only make six as Australia declared at 5/560. Somerset reached 2/63 in reply before McCool took four quick wickets amid their collapse to 7/68. McCool ended with 4/21 as the hosts folded for 115. Forced to follow on, Somerset reached 3/49 before McCool took four of the next five wickets as the hosts fell to 8/66, and eventually 71 all out, handing Australia victory by an innings and 374 runs. In the following match against the South of England, McCool batted at No. 8 and made five as Australia declared at 7/522. McCool toiled for 36 overs in taking 2/89 as the hosts were bowled out for 298 when rain caused the match to end in a draw. 
Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current England Test players be allowed to play. After the hosts had complied, Bradman selected a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Ring’s omission for Johnson, so McCool was left out. After Australia had taken a 312-run first innings lead, the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. 
The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first match, McCool came in with Australia 4/91 and put on 109 with Arthur Morris to consolidate the innings. When McCool was out for 52 and Morris for 109, the Australians collapsed and lost 6/36 to end with 236. McCool took 1/19 and 1/20 as Australia enforced the follow on and completed an innings victory. In the second match, McCool took 3/31 as the hosts made 178 after batting first. He opened the innings with the bat and made 108 in three hours, with 13 fours. Australia declared at 6/407 and McCool took 0/19 in seven overs as Australia wrapped up the tour with another innings victory.
Role.
A frontline leg spinner and middle-order batsman, McCool was not prominent in the team's success. Although he had started his Test career strongly, McCool's form began to decline in the previous Australian season of 1947–48. In his first full Test season in 1946–47, which featured five Tests against England, McCool batted at No. 6 and scored 95 and 104 not out. He also took five wickets in an innings on two occasions. He ended the series with 272 runs at an average of 54.40 and took 18 wickets at just over 27 apiece. However, in the following season he made only 46 runs and took only three wickets in three Tests against India before being dropped. Nevertheless, McCool started the tour in Bradman's first-choice team, and was selected in the tour opener against Worcestershire and later against the MCC in his role as an all rounder. 
Bowling for long periods caused McCool to continually tear a callus on his third finger, which he used to impart spin on the ball. As a result, Bradman felt compelled to leave him out of the Test matches, feeling that his finger would not be able to handle the necessarily long bowling spells. This decision was aided by England and Australia’s agreement to allow a new ball to be used every 55 overs, instead of the incumbent regulation of permitting a new ball for every 200 runs scored, which usually took longer than 55 overs. This meant the ball was in a shiny state more often, and therefore more conducive to fast and swing bowling, so Bradman relied heavily on his pacemen. For the rest of his career, McCool was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning finger. 
McCool was thus one of two players along with Ron Hamence who did not play a Test during the season. Along with Doug Ring, Hamence and McCool called themselves "ground staff" because of the paucity of their on-field duties in the major matches, and they often sang ironic songs about their status. The cricket writer Alan Gibson, who knew McCool well in his later cricket career at Somerset, said the omission "distressed him greatly at the time, though he could be philosophical enough about it later". 
McCool took 57 first-class wickets at 17.82; he was the fifth most prolific wicket-taker and had the fourth best average among Australia's seven frontline bowlers. As England agreed to have a new ball available after every 55 overs, fast bowling dominated in the Tests, so McCool was used heavily in the tour matches to allow the leading pacemen to conserve their energy in preparation for the Tests. Outside the Tests, McCool had the fourth heaviest workload among the regular bowlers, although overall he bowled the least overs due to his injured finger. McCool had the worst economy rate among the regular bowlers, but he took his wickets at a faster rate; his strike rate was second only to paceman Ray Lindwall. 
Although McCool also played as a frontline batsman during his career, with a first-class average of 32.85 and 18 centuries, his batting performances during the tour were far below his usual standards, garnering only 306 runs at 20.40 with three half-centuries. His highest score was 76 against Gloucestershire, although he added two more fifties and a century against Scotland in the three non-first-class fixtures. During the tour, McCool usually batted from Nos. 5 to 8.N- A specialist at first slip, McCool remained prominent with his fielding, taking 20 catches in 17 matches.

Ron Hamence with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948

Ron Hamence was a member of Donald Bradman's famous Australian cricket team of 1948, which toured England and was undefeated in its 34 matches. As a result of this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England, the team earned the sobriquet "The Invincibles".
A right-handed middle-order batsman, Hamence was not instrumental in the team's success. Regarded as the last batsman to be chosen for the team, his selection was the subject of controversy because many batsmen who had scored more runs in the preceding Australian season had been overlooked. Hamence and Colin McCool were the only squad members who did not play a Test on tour. Hamence was used in non-Test tour matches so that the leading batsmen could conserve energy for the Tests, as play was scheduled for six days a week. Along with Doug Ring, Hamence and McCool called themselves "ground staff" because of their scant playing duties in the major matches, and they often created and sang ironic songs about their lack of opportunities. Bradman was reluctant to risk the team's unbeaten record and as a result, Hamence did not receive many opportunities to bat high in the order, something that was the subject of criticism.
Hamence scored 582 runs at a batting average of 32.33, with a top-score of 99. He was the only frontline Australian batsman not to score a century. The remaining eight frontline batsmen each scored at least 973 runs and all averaged no less than 47.30. Hamence also occasionally opened the bowling in the tour matches with his gentle medium pace, allowing the team's leading bowlers to recuperate between Tests.
Background.
During the preceding 1947–48 season in Australia, Hamence was dropped from the national team. He had played sporadically in the Test team, being selected in three of the ten matches in the previous two seasons. In those three Tests he scored a total of 81 runs at an average of 27.00. Returning to domestic cricket following his omission, Hamence scored 85 and 66 against Queensland, a performance which kept him in the running for a place in the national team. His selection for the 1948 tour of England under Bradman was the subject of considerable controversy, as many other batsmen were overlooked despite being more productive during the Australian summer. For his part, Bradman described his middle-order—Hamence among them—as "an array of batsmen who could scarcely fail". From the start, Hamence was on the outer with regards to selection in the Tests. He was not selected for any of the Tests during the English campaign, but in a 2008 interview, emphasised that he felt no resentment over his omission. Hamence was a popular member of the touring party and his cheerful nature and splendid tenor voice added to the good spirits of the team. His roommate during the tour was the seamer Ernie Toshack.
Early tour.
Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Being a fringe member of the squad and having made only sporadic Test appearances in previous seasons, Hamence was not selected. Australia promptly crushed the hosts by an innings.
Hamence made his debut on English soil in the second tour match against Leicestershire. Batting at No. 6, he came in at 4/344 and made only seven. His dismissal triggered a collapse of 5/38 as Australia were bowled out for 448 before winning by an innings. The next match against Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling, was the closest Australia came to defeat on the tour. Batting at No. 4, Hamence made 12 in the first innings as Australia replied to Yorkshire's 71 with 101. He batted slowly, coming in at 2/24 before departing at 7/74. After Australia dismissed the hosts for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 3/13 in pursuit of 60 for victory. Hamence came in and scored one before he was run out after being slow to set off for a quick single; Australia collapsed to 6/31. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia effectively had only three wickets in hand and faced their first loss to an English county since 1912. However, Australia scraped home by four wickets after a counterattack by Neil Harvey and Don Tallon, aided by a dropped catch and missed stumping.
Hamence was rested as the Australians travelled to London to defeat Surrey at The Oval by an innings. He returned for the next match against Cambridge University. Elevated to No. 3 by stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett, Hamence came in at 1/64 and put on a partnership of 176 with Bill Brown, ending with 92 as Australia piled on 4/414 and won by an innings. Hamence scored mainly from the back foot, and Jack Fingleton opined "a nice innings it was, too, in its neat strokemaking". Hamence also bowled for the first time on tour, sending down three overs for seven runs in the second innings without taking a wicket.
In the following match, Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs, their largest winning margin for the summer. On the first day, Australia set a world record by scoring 721, the most first-class runs added in one day. Halfway through the day, at 2/364, all rounder Keith Miller came to the crease. A cavalier and carefree character, Miller resented Bradman's ruthless attitude towards annihilating the opposition and often refused to try when Australia were in an unassailable position. He deliberately let the ball hit the stumps and was out for a golden duck. Hamence came in and struck 46, adding 146 runs for the fifth wicket with Sam Loxton. The partnership took only an hour, and Australia went on to win by an innings. Miller later said that one of his reasons for gifting his wicket was to protest the lack of opportunities given to Hamence and other fringe batsmen. Batting at No. 5 in the next match against Oxford University, Hamence made only three as Australia made 431 and proceeded to another innings victory.
The next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests,N- and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage. Given Hamence's early struggles in the English conditions, which saw him make only 161 runs at 26.83 in his first six innings, while all of Australia's first-choice top six had made centuries,N- he was not selected; Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings.
Recalled for the next match, against Lancashire at Old Trafford in Manchester, Hamence scored two while batting at No. 7 in the first innings and an unbeaten 49 at No. 6 in the second, putting on an unbeaten century partnership with Harvey as the match ended in a draw after the entire first day's play was lost to rain. His second innings was praised for the aesthetic quality. It was the first match on tour that Australia had failed to win. Hamence was rested for the following match against Nottinghamshire, which was again drawn, before returning against Hampshire. He made five as Australia were dismissed for 117 in reply to the home side's 195, the first time the tourists had conceded a first innings lead during the season. He did not get another chance with the bat as Australia recovered to win by eight wickets.
Hamence had one last chance to make his case for Test selection in the match against Sussex at Hove, the last county fixture before the First Test at Trent Bridge. He came to the crease at 4/453 and made 34 in a stand of 96 with Harvey. His dismissal and Harvey reaching his 100 prompted Australia to declare at 5/549. Bradman said that Hamence was "the unlucky player of the match" and that he was standing on the balcony ready to declare when Hamence fell on the last ball of the over. Australia went on to complete an innings victory. In the second innings, Hamence opened the bowling with Ray Lindwall. He took an early wicket before ending the innings by claiming the last man to fall, a stumping by Ron Saggers standing up to the stumps.
Test omission.
Since World War II, the first five positions in Australia's Test batting order had regularly consisted of Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman, Hassett and Miller, while the sixth position saw many occupants. All of the first five were selected for the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC, and retained their positions for the First Test.
This left one position for the remaining batsmen in the squad. Up to this point, Brown had scored 800 runs on tour at an average of 72.72, with four centuries, and was on his third tour of England. Brown had played in the first-choice team in the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC. Harvey had accumulated 296 runs at 42.29, all rounder Loxton had 310 runs at 51.66, but was injured, while Hamence had made only 251 runs at 27.88 and was the only one of the four to not have scored a century. Hamence was overlooked while Brown gained selection in the First Test at Trent Bridge, batting out of position in the middle-order while Barnes and Morris were preferred as the first-choice opening pair, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India. This was the exact situation that had unfolded in the Worcestershire and MCC matches where Australia fielded their first-choice team; Brown batted in the middle order. Bradman explained the decision in his memoirs: "Hamence was not in good enough form and Harvey scarcely ready". During the opening stages of the tour, Bradman spent little time talking to Hamence at practice sessions, leading analysts to conclude that the Australian skipper viewed Hamence as being highly unlikely to play in the Tests. Australia went on to defeat England by eight wickets, although Brown struggled and made only 17.
Between Tests, Hamence earned selection for the match against Northamptonshire, batting at No. 4 and scoring 34; he partnered acting captain Hassett in a stand of 104 for the third wicket. He took 1/11 in the second innings as Australia won by an innings. In the second match before the Second Test, which was against Yorkshire, Hamence made 48 and six not out, and took a total of 1/17 as the game ended in a draw. He batted slowly and cautiously; Bradman gave him few opportunities, so he had to make the most of them. The first innings 48 was a determined performance on a sticky wicket that helped Australia to 249; Bradman felt that Hamence's grit was a notable factor in Australia managing to pass 200. Harvey made 49 and 56 while Brown made 19 and 113 as an opener. This was enough for Brown to retain his middle-order position for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded an unchanged team. Australia went on to a crushing win by 409 runs but Brown made only 24 and 32.
The next match was against Surrey and started the day after the Second Test. As the Test players were tired, Bradman gave them a lighter workload and assigned Hamence and Loxton to open the bowling. Both took two wickets and Hamence snared opposing captain Laurie Fishlock and Eric Bedser to end with 2/24. Brown injured a finger while fielding, so he was not able to bat in Australia's first innings. Hamence was thus elevated to open the batting. Hamence made a duck, but Australia nevertheless took a 168-run lead. Hamence opened the bowling for the second time, although he was unable to take a wicket and ended with 0/30. In the second innings, Harvey volunteered to play as a makeshift opener alongside Loxton and they chased down the 122 runs for victory in less than an hour to complete a 10-wicket win.
For the following match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test, Brown and Hamence did not play. Harvey made 95 and Loxton ended on 159 not out as Australia reached 7/774 declared, its highest of the tour, underpinning an innings victory. As a result of the performance, Loxton seized Brown's middle-order position for the Third Test at Old Trafford.
During the drawn Third Test, opening batsman Sid Barnes was injured. This opened up a vacancy for the Fourth Test. Hamence made 30 as Australia defeated Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match before the Fourth Test at Headingley. Hamence was overlooked for the vacancy as Harvey was called in. Australia scored 3/404 to set a world record for the highest successful Test run chase; Harvey scored a century.
Immediately after the Test, Hamence made 21 at No. 6 as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings. In the next match against Glamorgan, Hamence was yet to bat when rain ended the match at 3/215 in Australia's first innings. He was rested as Australia defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets. Hamence was recalled as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. He made 14 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 10 in the second when Australia declared, having batted at No. 5 both times. In the last match before the Fifth Test, a non-first-class fixture against Durham, Hamence scored 24 batting at No. 6 in Australia's 282. The match was a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. Hamence was overlooked for the Fifth Test, as Australia won by an innings to seal the series 4–0; the drawn Third Test was Australia's only non-victory.
Later tour matches.
Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and Hamence made 38. Hamence was the ninth man to fall as partners ran out and Australia lost their last seven wickets for 89 to end at 361. Despite this, they completed an innings victory. In the next match against the Gentlemen of England, Hamence batted at No. 7 and only had a limited opportunity to contribute, coming in at 5/532 and scoring 24 before Bradman declared at 5/610 when Hassett reached 200. Hamence bowled in both innings for a total of 1/41 as Australia won by an innings. In the next match against Somerset, Hamence put on 195 for the fifth wicket with Ian Johnson to take Australia to 4/501 with his score on 99. The other batsmen had all made centuries, and the Australian players were keen to see Hamence do the same. With his score on 99, the rest of the team left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone. However, Hamence hit two balls from the middle of the bat, only to see them travel directly to the fielder, yielding no runs. Anxious to reach his century, Hamence then charged down the pitch and was then stumped for 99, his highest score for the season. According to Bradman, Hamence "fell to what everyone said was the best ball all day". Nevertheless, Australia won by an innings and 374 runs. In the following match against the South of England, Hamence made seven as Australia declared at 7/522. The match was washed out; Hamence bowled three overs without success in the hosts' only innings.
Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was the fixture against Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six players currently in England's Test team be allowed to play for the hosts. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, so Hamence was left out. Australia led by 312 on the first innings and were well in control, but the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Hamence batted once in each match, scoring six and 15 as Australia ended the tour with two innings victories.
Role.
During the tour, Hamence played 19 first-class matches and scored 582 runs at an average of 32.33. An occasional bowler who delivered 56.3 overs of medium pace during the tour, he took seven wickets at 21.42 and completed nine catches. He was the most successful of the specialist batsmen with the ball, occasionally opening the bowling in the tour matches, such as in both innings of the second match against Surrey and the second innings of the second match against Yorkshire. This allowed Bradman to rest his first-choice bowlers to keep them fresh for the Tests. Hamence's primary role was to allow the leading batsmen an opportunity to conserve energy for the Tests; the Australians generally had six days of play scheduled every week. In most of the matches, Hamence batted in the middle order at Nos. 5, 6 and 7.N- Along with Loxton, he was given 22 first-class opportunities with the bat, whereas the other eight frontline batsmen had at least 26 innings. Loxton scored 973 runs, while the others all scored more than 1,000. All of the batsmen other than Loxton averaged at least 47.30. and as Australia won many of their matches by an innings or by eight or more wickets, he seldom batted in the second innings. On four occasions, he was unbeaten when Australia either declared, reached their target or time ran out. 
Teammate Sid Barnes criticised the omission of Hamence from much meaningful cricket on the tour. Referring to the match against the Gentlemen of England, Barnes criticised the fact that Bradman, Hassett and himself all made centuries, while Hamence was only given a short innings in the lower order and was not out on 24 when Australia declared. As the tourists were already in a strong position, Barnes reasoned that Hamence "could have been sent in first wicket down, where he batted with his interstate team ... Despite this, Hassett still went in before Hamence in the next game, against Somerset ... Hamence batted No. 6... but he should have been sent in No. 3." 
Barnes reported that Hamence, along with the other frequent omissions Colin McCool and Doug Ring, termed themselves the "ground staff". He added: "In the dressing room during county games they would break out into ironic song about the few chances they got." Loxton reported that these songs included the "odd risque limerick". Bradman did later state that "because of the strong array of batsman ahead of him, seldom had an opportunity to make big scores" but "was an extremely useful reserve who could have been played in the Tests with confidence". Following the 1948 tour, Bradman described Hamence as "a fine batsman of the strictly orthodox type. Very sound and reliable with his game based on driving" and a "very safe fieldsman". Bradman added that Hamence had few opportunities because of Australia's batting strength but "always batted well and often at a critical moment made valuable runs". Bradman said that Hamence "could have been played in the Tests with confidence" and praised his contributions to team morale. Fingleton said "there was criticism of his selection in this side, but had the war not intervened he undoubtedly would have made a [Ashes trip before".

German Prince

Definition.
The term German Prince or Princess is often used to refer to members of royalty that were from a German state. Today Germany is one nation, but up until 1914, Germany and Central Europe was ruled over by a large number of independent states. Up until World War I, the term German could have referred to peoples from areas of what is today the states Germany, Poland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, and even Croatia and the Netherlands. From 1815 to 1860 this number was 35 separate German sovereign states (including Prussia and Austria) plus another 4 free cities, who together formed the German Confederation. Prior to 1789 there were over 300 independent sovereign states and thousands of other bishoprics, lordships, and free cities that made up the Holy Roman Empire.
Why use Germans?
When the term German Prince or Princess is used, it is referring to a member of one of the many ruling sovereign houses of the Central Europe region. They were often used as suitable marriage candidates, simply due to the fact there were so many of them. Also, as all of the European royalty were related, it helped to use a German prince/princess to keep the marriage "in the family", so to speak, or sometimes the opposite: to broaden the gene pool. The only other area of Europe that was close to be being ruled over by so many different sovereign states was Italy which after 1815 was made up of at least 11 different states, with the rest of Europe being ruled over by large states.
Examples.
Queen Mary of United Kingdom, queen consort of King George V. She was originally the Princess of Teck, a small principality in Württemberg, and was married in 1893.

1963 Dahomeyan coup d'état

The 1963 Dahomey coup d'état was staged on October 28, 1963 by Christophe Soglo, who took control of the country to prevent a civil war. He overthrew Hubert Maga, whose presidency faced extreme economic stagnation and a host of other problems.
Background.
The West African country of Dahomey, now known as Benin, was largely ignored by the French during its colonial era. Dahomey had a weak economy, propelled by the lack of known natural resources; the last time the country had a favorable trade balance was in 1924. Its main export was intellectuals, and was known as the Latin Quarter of Africa due to its rich cultural landscape. On August 1, 1960, Dahomey gained its independence and prominent politician Hubert Maga was chosen as its first president. At the time, Dahomey was also facing a major economic recession. Now that Dahomey was independent, France no longer offered subsidies. Maga helped counter this by investing in the infrastructure and encouraging civil servants to take Dahomey as their residence. Still, Dahomey's GDP grew by 1.4 percent annually from 1957–1965, making Dahomey's economy one of the weakest in Africa.
The economic stagnation triggered intense regionalistic attitudes in Dahomey. Parties epitomising the idea began with the 1951 parliamentary elections. Capitalising on growing cynicism for the domination of southern Dahomey in the French colony's politics, Maga allied himself with the northern tribes. Sourou-Migan Apithy, whom academic Samuel Decalo described as "the grandfather of Dahomeyan politics," kept the second seat, which he won in 1946. Apithy represented the people living in southeast Benin, while a third figure, Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, represented the southwest. Attempts to counteract regionalism failed, as did the establishment of a single party state. Coalitions between Maga, Apithy, and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin were similarly unsuccessful, as each sought absolute power.
In early 1961, the president began applying repressive measures on the opposition press and anyone suspected of trouble-making, thus practically eliminated Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin's voice in the country. By April, most U.D.D. members had expressed interest in joining the P.D.U., and Maga not only supported this but encouraged it. A notable exception was Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin himself. The choice was soon made for him; the entire U.D.D. was dissolved by Maga on April 11. Maga now attempted to designed a four-year growth plan, to begin on January 1, 1962, that contained many ambitious acts. It was designed to increase yield in agriculture and was financed by French capital. Part of the plan was to cut all wages by ten percent. Young Dahomeyans would contribute "human investment", or forced labor on the fields.
Maga decided to reshuffle the cabinet in February 1962. He added the Planning and Development duties to Apithy's office to quench his apparently unquenchable thirst for power. Nonetheless, he accused Maga of being a dictator, and the series of demonstrations the Vice President coordinated would ultimately depose his boss. They were not sparked by Maga himself, but rather the murder of David Dessou.
Dessou riots.
January 1962 saw the poisoning of Dessou, an official of the Sakete sub-prefecture. The deputy from his constituency, named Christophe Bokhiri, was accused of the crime and duly arrested. He was released after his fellow deputies in the National Assembly requested to suspend proceedings against him under the parliamentary immunity clauses of the Dahomey Constitution, specifically Article 37. Maga, meanwhile, was away in Paris during all of this.
The people of Dahomey, on the other hand, were outraged on the release of Bokhiri. They incited racial clashes in the summer of 1963, as the murderer and the victim were of different tribes. Demonstrations were organized in Porto Novo on October 21 and soon spread to Cotonou. They remained somewhat orderly before the trade unionists were involved. While still led by Maga, the trade unionists were still upset by the wage cut and used the case to further their interests. In addition, they criticized what they called Maga's "squander-mania", such as the construction of a presidential palace. Most of the demonstrations were peaceful, although several demonstrators destroyed a sign containing Maga's name on a hospital. Six trade unionists were arrested on the second day of demonstrations, causing the unions to call a general strike. By the end of the second day, protesters forced the National Assembly to put Bokhiri back in jail, which simultaneously enforced a curfew.
In light of recent events, Maga cancelled his trip to the United States and returned to Dahomey immediately. Appealing for peace, he convened a special National Assembly session. The protesters and trade unionists were indifferent to these actions; when Maga agreed with their demands and replaced his government with a provisional one in which Apithy and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin had equal standing, they organized themselves to "boo" this new order. Armed northerners came down to Cotonou to support Maga and clashed with dissenters, killing two. The protesters, however, would not return to their jobs until Maga no longer held his.
Coup.
On October 28 Chief of Staff of the 800-man Dahomeyan Army Christophe Soglo took control of the country to prevent a civil war. He dismissed the cabinet, dissolved the Assembly, suspended the constitution and banned any type of demonstrations. After having Maga sign his resignation the same day he gave Maga, Apithy, and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin the powers of the Ministry of State. Southern Dahomey later created a statue in honor of this day in the national history.
The strikes ended the next day. The reasons for the overthrow of Maga was the "luxurious life style of the rulers, abusive increase in the number of ministerial posts, unsatisfied social demands, unkept promises, the rise of the cost of living, and antidemocratic measures that martyrized the people and reduced them to nothing."
Aftermath.
The provisional government dissolved the P.D.U. and replaced it by a Dahomeyan Democratic Party (P.D.D.). It announced a referendum on the status of the constitution was to be held on December 15. At the same time, a committee was established to investigate perceived wrongdoings by the Maga administration. In late November, it began prosecuting members of the cabinet, such as the Minister of National Economy and the Finance Minister for misusing public funds. Maga was soon to find himself in jail too.
Soglo and Maga were friends. However, in early December, Soglo discovered a plot to have him assassinated and blamed Maga. and resigned his post on December 4. A few days after the discovery, he was placed under house arrest along with four former cabinet members. At an official inquiry this conspiracy charge was dropped, but Maga was still guilty of corruption. Following a March 1964 retrial, Maga was let out of prison and went into exile in Paris.

<doc id="20824873" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20824873" title="Alison Gopnik">
Alison Gopnik

Alison Gopnik (born June 16, 1955) is an American professor of psychology and affiliate professor of philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. She is known for her work in the areas of cognitive and language development, specializing in the effect of language on thought, the development of a theory of mind, and causal learning. Her writing on psychology and cognitive science has appeared in "Science", "The Times Literary Supplement", "The New York Review of Books", "The New York Times", "New Scientist", "Slate" and others. Her body of work also includes four books and over 100 journal articles. She has frequently appeared on TV and radio including "The Charlie Rose Show" and "The Colbert Report". "Slate" writes of Gopnik, "One of the most prominent researchers in the field, Gopnik is also one of the finest writers, with a special gift for relating scientific research to the questions that parents and others most want answered. This is where to go if you want to get into the head of a baby." Gopnik is a columnist for "The Wall Street Journal", sharing the Mind & Matter column with Matt Ridley on alternating Saturdays. 
Academic career.
Gopnik received a B.A., majoring in psychology and philosophy, from McGill University in 1975. In 1980, she received a D.Phil. in experimental psychology from Oxford University. She worked at the University of Toronto before joining the faculty at UC Berkeley in 1988.
Gopnik has done extensive work with applying Bayesian networks to human learning and has published and presented numerous papers on the topic. Gopnik says of this work, "The interesting thing about Bayes nets is that they search out causes rather than mere associations. They give you a single representational structure for dealing both with things that just happen and with interventions--things you observe others doing to the world or things you do to the world. This is important because there is something really special about the way we treat and understand human action. We give it a special status in terms of our causal inferences. We think of human actions as things that you do that are designed to change things in the world as opposed to other events that just take place."
Judea Pearl, developer of Bayesian networks, says Gopnik was one of the first psychologists to note that the mathematical models also resemble how children learn. Gopnik's work at Berkeley's Child Study Center seeks to develop mathematical models of how children learn. These models could be used to develop better algorithms for artificial intelligence.
In April, 2013, Gopnik was inducted into The American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
Notable publications.
Gopnik is an authority on the philosophy of mind and a preeminent developmental psychologist. Gopnik is known for advocating the "theory theory" which postulates that the same mechanisms used by scientists to develop scientific theories are used by children to develop causal models of their environment. The "theory theory" was explored in ""Words, Thoughts, and Theories"," co-authored with Andrew N. Meltzoff. Gopnik co-authored with Andrew N. Meltzoff and Patricia K. Kuhl ""The Scientist in the Crib: What Early Learning Tells Us About the Mind"." The book posits that the cognitive development of children in early life is made possible by three factors: innate knowledge, advanced learning ability, and the evolved ability of parents to teach their offspring. ""Causal Learning: Psychology, Philosophy, and Computation"," edited with Laura Schulz, explores causal learning and the interdisciplinary work done in furthering the understanding of learning and reasoning.
In her book ""The Philosophical Baby: What Children’s Minds Tell Us about Truth, Love, and the Meaning of Life"," Gopnik explores how infants and young children cognitively develop by using processes similar to those used by scientists, including experimenting on their environment. The book explains how an environment maximized for an infant's cognitive development is one that is safe to explore. The book also explores what babies can tell us about love, imagination and identity, as well as considering the broader philosophical significance of care-giving. ""The Philosophical Baby"" has been recognized as a New York Times Extended List Bestseller, a San Francisco Chronicle Bestseller, and an Independent Bookstores Bestseller. It has also received acclaim on the New York Times Editor's Choice list, the San Francisco Chronicle Editors Choice list, and as one of Babble's 50 Best Parenting Books. It has also been recognized as recommended reading by Scientific American.
In 2009, Gopnik published a paper in "Hume Studies" arguing that the historical record regarding the circumstances around David Hume's authoring of "A Treatise of Human Nature" are wrong. Gopnik argued that Hume had access to the library of the Royal College at La Flèche, a Jesuit-run institution that had been founded by Henri IV. At the time Hume was living nearby and working on the "Treatise", La Flèche was home to a Jesuit missionary named Charles Francois Delu, a learned man who was an expert on different world religions who had visited the French embassy in Siam. In addition, Delu had met Ippolito Desideri, another Jesuit missionary who had visited Tibet from 1716–1721. Gopnik argues that because of his exposure to Theravada Buddhism, Delu may form the source of the Buddhist influence on Hume's "Treatise". Gopnik cites a number of letters from Hume that mention his time at La Flèche and his meeting with Jesuits from the college. It is from this Buddhist connection through the learning of the Jesuit college that Hume is influenced to deny the ontological reality of the self—which Gopnik links to the Tibetan Buddhist idea of "sunyata".
Personal life.
Gopnik is the daughter of linguist Myrna Gopnik. She is the firstborn of six siblings that include Blake Gopnik, the "Newsweek" art critic, and Adam Gopnik, a writer for "The New Yorker". She was formerly married to journalist George Lewinski and has three sons: Alexei, Nicholas, and Andres Gopnik-Lewinski. She is now married to computer graphics pioneer Alvy Ray Smith, the co-founder of Pixar.

Rumachenanck tribe

The Rumanchenank were a Lenape people who inhabited the region radiating from Palisades in New York and New Jersey at the time of European colonialization in the 17th century. Settlers to the provincial colony of New Netherland called them the "Haverstroo" meaning "oat straw", which became "Haverstraw" in English, and still used to describe part of their territory. 
Like the Tappan (Native Americans), whose territory overlapped, the Rumanchenank were a seasonally migrational people, who farmed (companion planting), hunted, fished, and trapped. As all Lenape tribes, they were divided into clans, in this case Wolf, Turkey, and Turtle. They spoke the Munsee dialect of Lenape. They, as well as the Hackensack, Raritan, Wappinger, Canarsee, were collectively known as the River Indians. Those groups living in the adjoining highlands to the west and valley to north have become known as the Munsee, and sometimes the Esopus. The Haverstraws were the tribesmen who had the trouble with Verrazzano and the crew of the Half Moon while that vessel was anchored near Stony Point in 1609.
On 6 March 1660, a representative of the Rumanchenank took part, with other local leaders, in a peace treaty with the settlers at New Amsterdam, capital of the province. Various land conveyances in 1666, 1671, 1683, and 1685 involved the Haverstraw, and indicate their territory as having been on disputed lands involved in the New York-New Jersey Line War, which was not finally settled until the 18th century. 
In 1664 after the supremacy of the English, the Rumanchenank were absorbed by the Tappans.
Some Rumachenanck may have become part of the Ramapough Mountain Indians.

Big Brother 5 (Netherlands)

Three years after its initial cancellation Big Brother was brought back. John de Mol decided to air it on his own TV station Talpa. Although he did not own the rights any more (he had left Endemol), he hadn’t forgotten his jewel. Series 5 was shown with moderate success in the early evening from 24 August until 22 December (121 days). The house had moved from Almere to Aalsmeer, and the presenters were Bridget Maasland and Ruud de Wild. The theme for this season was secrecy, housemates entered with a secret that they weren’t allowed to reveal to other housemates. Aside from usual weekly tasks, the housemates received secret missions to spark distrust and conflicts. Some gained cash which they had to hide from the other housemates.
The series was dominated by the relationship between Dido and Roel, who shared his bed with Lieske and Linda as well. The series borrowed elements from foreign series, like the introduction of Nathalie’s ex-boyfriend. However, most attention was directed at Tanja, who was seven months pregnant. Tanja could be evicted before the baby would be born. Tanja’s smoking during pregnancy were debated in the media, as well as the role of the father who didn’t want any responsibility but enjoyed his fame.
On 18 October 2005 Tanja gave birth to her daughter Joscelyn Savanna in front of the cameras, a Big Brother first. Because of limitations by the Dutch Labour Inspectorate, the baby wasn’t allowed to be shown for extended periods. Tanja voluntary left with her daughter on day 65 as she felt she was being poorly treated by her fellow housemates.
Towards the end of the season the producers were accused of tempering with the results of the SMS-and telephone votes during eviction rounds. A campaign by third season housemate Gert-Jan de Boer called for attendance of a notary at least during the finals. and Endemol gave in. In the end the winner of the season was Joost.

Bwatue

"Bwatue" is a song by Phil Ochs, a U.S. singer-songwriter best known for the protest songs he wrote in the 1960s. He co-wrote the song with two African musicians named Dijiba and Bukasa. "Bwatue" was written and recorded in 1973.
"Bwatue" was written while Ochs was visiting Kenya. Its lyrics are in Lingala. The title means "canoe"; the lyrics develop the river as a metaphor for life. "Bwatue" was released as a single in Africa by A&M Records. The B-side of the single, "Niko Mchumba Ngombe", also by Ochs, Dijiba, and Bukasa, was written in Swahili. Both songs were recorded by Ochs with the Pan-African Ngembo Rumba Band. The record was a commercial failure.
"Bwatue" and "Niko Mchumba Ngombe" have been described as early examples of blending Western popular music with world music, and critics note that they predate Paul Simon's "Graceland" by more than ten years. Still, one critic says the record "should be seen more as a curiosity rather than a serious attempt at exploring a new style". One of Ochs' biographers cynically suggests that Ochs recorded the songs in order to deduct the cost of his trip to Africa from his income tax as a business expense.
In the early 1990s, the single was reissued in a limited edition of 1000 by Sparkle Records, ostensibly on behalf of the Phil Ochs Fan Club of Canada. The reissue was unauthorized and is considered a bootleg.
The only known review of the single was positive. Reviewing the bootleg release in "Dirty Linen", Cliff Furnald wrote that "the band gives a superb look at the Zaire/Kenyan dance style at the time before mass marketing started the diluting downward trend".
Because of the single's limited release, "Bwatue" and "Niko Mchumba Ngombe" were extremely rare. Most Ochs fans never heard the songs before they were included in 1997's "American Troubadour". "Niko Mchumba Ngombe" was also included in the 2004 collection "".
