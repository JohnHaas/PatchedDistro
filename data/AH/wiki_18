Pletzl

The Pletzl (פלעצל, "little place" in the Yiddish language) is the Jewish quarter in the fourth arrondissement of Paris, France. The Place Saint-Paul and the surrounding area were, unofficially, named the Pletzl when the neighborhood became predominantly Jewish because of an influx of immigrants at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth.
When the Parisian Jews were expelled from the city 600 years ago, it was here in the Marais district that they settled. (The Marais was just outside the city wall at the time.) The depth and diversity of the community have grown over the years through immigration from Eastern Europe and North Africa. The area is now characterised by its synagogues, butchers, Jewish delicatessens, and falafel vendors, which provide a social and cultural fabric for its inhabitants.
The darkest days for this community came during the Second World War, when Vichy collaboration with the Nazis resulted in the raids in which many residents were abducted and sent off to death camps. Today, the community is an Orthodox one, extremely religious, and most citizens belong to one of the three local synagogues; one located at 17, rue des Rosiers, another at 25, rue des Rosiers and the one at 10, rue Pavée, an "art nouveau" temple designed by Hector Guimard, famous for his work on the Paris Métro.
Why Pletzl?
Some time ago, the City of Paris installed a plaque at the corner of the Rue des Rosiers and the Rue Ferdinand Duval that explains why the Jewish quarter is known as the "Pletzl".
Translated, it reads:
"Fleeing persecution, Ashkenazi Jews flooded into Paris beginning in 1881. They found places living among their co-religionists already established in the Marais. By 1900, about 6,000 had arrived from Rumania, Russia and Austria-Hungary; 18,000 more arrived in the years preceding the First World War. Installed in considerable numbers in the Rue des Écouffes, the Rue Ferdinand Duval (named "Rue des Juifs", "Jews Street", until about 1900), and the Rue des Rosiers, they constituted a new community, the "Pletzl", the "little place" in Yiddish, and they created the "École Israelite du Travail" (Israelite Trade School) at 4B, Rue des Rosiers. The life of this community was evoked in the Roger Ikor novel, "Les Eaux Mêlées" ("Agitated Waters"), won the Prix Goncourt in 1955. More than half of them perished in the Nazi concentration camps."

Dogmatic Sarcophagus

The Dogmatic Sarcophagus, also known as the "Trinity Sarcophagus" is an early Christian sarcophagus of about 320–350, now in the Vatican Museums (Vatican 104). It was discovered in the 19th century during rebuilding works at the basilica di San Paolo fuori le Mura.
It and the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus are two of the most important examples of Christian-Roman sculpture of the Constantinian era. It draws its name from its clear references to the dogmas of the Council of Nicaea (325), in particular to Christ being consubstantial with God the Father, as shown (for example) by the scene of a figure with the appearance of Jesus between Adam and Eve, though whether the figure is to be understood as Christ or God the Father is less clear – the dogmatic point works either way.
Description.
The front face is split into two registers, typical of the style of the time, with Old Testament and New Testament subjects and a central shell-shaped "clipeus" containing the portraits of the dead couple, embraced and wearing marital clothes typical of the 4th century ("tunica manicata", "dalmatina" and "toga contabulata" by the man, who holds a "rotulus" in his hand, and tunic and palla by the woman). The heads are basic types, showing there was either no desire or not enough time to personalize the sarcophagus.
In the upper register are five episodes, two from the book of Genesis and two miracles of Christ:
In the lower register are six scenes, one linked to Christ's birth, two to the Bible and three to St Peter:
The sarcophagus can be dated to between 330 and 340 due to the male hairstyles (apart from those of Christ and Peter), the squat square figures and the lack of calligraphic detail. There are echoes of the previous "plebeian" official art, which has led some to suggest that the sarcophagus is from the same workshop that produced and amended the reliefs for the Arch of Constantine, although there are already signs of a desire for classicism that only fully showed itself later (the arch is dated to 350, ten years later than the sarcophagus).
Iconography.
The account in Genesis naturally credits the Creation to the single figure of God, in Christian terms, God the Father. However the first person plural in Genesis 1:26 "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness", and New Testament references to Christ as creator (John 1:3, Colossians 1:15) led Early Christian writers to associate the Creation with the Logos, or pre-existing Christ. 
A number of other sarcophagi, most conveniently collected in the same Vatican collection as the Dogmatic Sarcophagus, also show groups of three figures usually interpreted as representing the Trinity in scenes from Genesis. Sometimes one figure is beardless, while the other two are bearded. Given the funerary context, and that adjacent scenes often show New Testament miracles, including the Raising of Lazarus, the emphasis of these scenes may relate as much to the overcoming of sin and hope of new life as the Fall of Man. 
Christ was compared to Adam in Romans 5:14–21, and was sometimes called the "new Adam", especially in connection with baptism (at this period catechumens were apparently naked when this was administered). This may also be referred to in the second scene, or the central figure may represent the Divine Logos, who is also shown with the appearance of Jesus. The scene represents the "division of labours" between Adam and Eve; the central figure holds a sheaf of corn in one hand and a dead hare (in another Vatican example a lamb) in the other, although one might expect hunting hares to be Adam's task and agriculture Eve's, rather than the opposite as the sarcophagus seems to suggest.
Adam and Eve also functioned as typological forerunners of Jesus and Mary, and the Tree of Knowledge of the Cross of the Crucifixion. In addition they represented faithfulness in marriage, and scenes of them between the Logos are interpreted by some as representing their marriage ceremony, suitable for the sarcophagus of a married couple.

Barnard 68

Barnard 68 is a molecular cloud, dark absorption nebula or Bok globule, towards the southern constellation Ophiuchus and well within our own galaxy at a distance of about 500 light-years, so close that not a single star can be seen between it and the Sun. American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard added this nebula to his catalog of dark nebulae in 1919. He published his catalog in 1927, at which stage it included some 350 objects. Because of its opacity, its interior is extremely cold, its temperature being about 16 K (−257 °C). Its mass is about twice that of the Sun and it measures about half a light-year across.
Characteristics.
Despite being opaque at visible-light wavelengths, use of the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal has revealed the presence of about 3,700 blocked background Milky Way stars, some 1,000 of which are visible at infrared wavelengths. Careful measurements of the degree of obscuration resulted in a finely sampled and accurate mapping of the dust distribution inside the cloud. Observations obtained with Herschel Space Observatory were able to constrain the distribution of the dust component and its temperature even more. Having a dark cloud in the solar neighborhood greatly facilitates observation and measurement. If not disrupted by external forces, the stability of dust clouds is a fine balance between outward pressure caused by the heat or pressure of the cloud's contents, and inward gravitational forces generated by the same particles (see Jeans instability and Bonnor-Ebert mass). This causes the cloud to wobble or oscillate in a manner not unlike that of a large soap bubble or a water-filled balloon which is jiggled. In order for the cloud to become a star, gravity must gain the upper hand long enough to cause the collapse of the cloud and reach a temperature and density where fusion can be sustained. When this happens, the much smaller size of the star's envelope signals a new balance between greatly increased gravity and radiation pressure.
The cloud's mass is about twice that of the Sun, and it measures about half a light-year across. Barnard 68's well-defined edges and other features show that it is on the verge of gravitational collapse within the next 100,000 years or so, and is on its way to becoming a star.

Shun Tono

He saw expanded action in 2008 as a mid-season call-up, and he was part of a young bullpen that led the Giants to a Japan Series berth against the eventual champion Saitama Seibu Lions. In 28 games, he pitched in relief in 26 of them and made two starts, one of them being his first career complete game against the Hiroshima Toyo Carp on September 24. He made four appearances in the '08 playoffs, all without giving up a run.
His first full season in 2009 started off very well, as Tono posted quality starts in four of his first five starts, en route to 14 for the year, but his smoking habit caught up with him late in the season. Run support was a problem for him though, as he had 10 no-decisions to go with his 8-8 record and a respectable 3.17 ERA. His season was marred by a bit of controversy, as Tono was pulled from his start on September 16 by manager Tatsunori Hara. A frustrated Hara said after the game, "As an athlete, not being able to quit smoking represents a larger weakness. He needs to get stronger." This was the third in a string of three straight poor starts for the young righty.
Ultimately, Tono was a part of the 2009 Japan Series Champion Giants, who defeated the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters in six games to with their 21st title. He pitched in three games in the postseason, giving up 1 run in 8 and 1/3 innings. He also started the deciding 6th game in the series, but had to leave with two down in the very first inning after being struck on the hand on a line drive by Nippon Ham Fighters first baseman Shinji Takahashi.
Pitching Style.
Tono is one of many starters in Japan who pitches exclusively from the stretch position, modifying his delivery when there are runners on base. He does not have overpowering pitches, as his four-seam fastball tops out only at 144 km/h (89 MPH). However, Tono does compensate with good control on his fastball and also has an array of other pitches, among them a sharp curveball, a late-breaking slider, and a forkball, leading to a lot of strikeouts. He is prone to bad spells resulting from errors or consecutive hits, and is also prone to giving up home runs. However, he is also adept at pitching out of jams and gets clutch strikeouts when needed.

Caravan (magazine)

Caravan magazine is a UK monthly consumer magazine for the touring caravan community.
It was Britain’s first caravanning magazine, offering advice and tips on every aspect of the hobby. Every month the magazine features touring and travel articles for the UK and Europe, new gadgets and products with the Caravan Lottery giveaway, show and event news, reviews, and feedback with reader content. Written by caravanners for caravanners, the magazine publishes advice on owning a caravan, from buying a towcar to choosing the right towing mirrors, awnings, gas bottles, and barbecues.
History.
Caravan magazine was founded by F L M Harris in May 1933 and produced from offices in Colney Heath near St. Albans. It was the Caravan Club's official magazine in the 1930s, and by 1940, "Caravan" magazine, The National Caravan Council and the Caravan Club all shared the same large house in Purley, South London.
By 1963, the first issue of "En Route", the Caravan Club's own magazine, had been published and Caravan magazine, now part of Link House Magazines, moved to new premises in Croydon. In the late 1990s, IPC Media took over Link House Magazines, and the IPC Inspire division of IPC Media began publication of Caravan.
The magazine underwent a redesign in June 2006 and as a result, increased its year-on-year circulation in 2007 by 15.5%, making it the fastest growing magazine in its division.
Currently on maternity leave, Victoria Bentley is the editor. She is the first woman to edit the title in its 75-year history.
Warners Group Publishing bought "Caravan" magazine in 2010 to join its portfolio of outdoor leisure magazines such as MMM, Go Caravan (now closed), Which Motorhome, Caravan Motorhome and Camping Mart, Camping magazine, Park and Holiday Homes, Your Luxury Lodge, and most recently, Caravan Buyer.

I-Change Model

In psychology, the I-change model or the Integrated Model for explaining motivational and behavioral change derives from the Attitude – Social Influence – Self-Efficacy Model, integrates ideas of Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior, Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory, Prochaska's Transtheoretical Model, the Health Belief Model, and Goal setting theories. Previous versions of this model (referred to as the ASE-model) have been used to explain a variety of types of health behavior.
Phases of behavioral change.
The I-Change Model is a phase model and assumes that at least three phases in the behavioral change process can be distinguished: 
1. Awareness; 2. Motivation; 3. Action. For each phase particular determinants are more relevant. 
Awareness.
Awareness of a particular problem in a person is the result of accurate knowledge and risk perceptions of the person about his own behavior (not all persons are aware of the level of their own behavior, for instance, many persons overestimate the amount of their physical activity. Cues in their environment (e.g. a person with cancer) may also prompt a person to become more aware of a particular risk and the need to adopt a particular health behavior. 
Motivation.
Motivation to change a behavior depends on a person's attitude (the results of perceived advantages and disadvantages of the behavior), social influence beliefs (norms of others, behavior of others, and support of others) and self-efficacy expectations (the perceived ability to perform a particular health behavior). The ultimate result in level of motivation to adopt a health behavior can be measured by intentions, a concept derived from Fishbein & Ajzen's Theory of Reasoned Action or related concepts such as the stage of change concept of the Transtheoretical Model of Prochaska.
Action.
Intentions do not necessarily lead to behavior. Factors determining action, besides a positive intention, are again self-efficacy, action planning and goal setting. With regard to action planning we distinguish preparation planning (planning actions required to change), initiation planning (planning the actions needed to perform the new behavior for the first time) and coping or maintenance planning (planning the actions to cope with barriers and relapse in order to maintain the realized changes). Additionally, the development of skills required for the new health behavior is needed as well.
Predisposing factors.
The I-Change Model assumes that these motivational processes are determined by various predisposing factors such as behavioral factors (e.g. life styles), psychological factors (e.g. personality), biological factors (e.g. gender, genetic predisposition), social and cultural factors (e.g. the price of cigarettes, policies), and information factors (the quality of messages, channels and sources used).

The Samaja

The Samaja is an Oriya daily newspaper published in Cuttack, Odisha, India; started in 1919, it is one of the oldest papers in this region. Utkalamani Gopabandhu Das, a prominent freedom fighter and social worker started it as a weekly from Satyabadi of Puri district of Odisha to facilitate the freedom struggle and to revive the moribund Oriya language. Under Gopabandhu's leadership, and with the support of local people, the paper grew into prominence. In 1928, just before the death of Gopabandhu, the paper was handed over to Lok Sevak Mandal (Servants of People Society), a non-profit organization started by freedom-fighter Lala Lajapatrai. Servants of the People Society still runs the paper.
In Odisha, Samaja is seen as a trusted and impartial newspaper. However, the newspaper is often accused of being too orthodox in its approach, which makes it less popular among the younger and urban generation. To reach out to the remotest readers, the Samaja has eight editions at Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, Sambalpur, Rourkella, Kolkota, Vizag, Balasore and Berhampur, as well as an internet edition as well as an e-paper edition.
History.
The founder of the Samaja, Utkalmani Gopabandhu Das, was a freedom fighter and social reformer. He was an ardent supporter of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation and was involved in the freedom struggle. Moreover, Gandhi is said to have been influenced by the simple life of Gopabandhu and after they came in contact with one another, Gandhi decided to follow a simple lifestyle. Gopabandhu took to journalism to facilitate reform. He published a monthly magazine called 'Satyabadi'. Later on October 10, 1919, he launched weekly Samaja. The day was chosen to coincide with Vijayadashami, one of the greatest Hindu festivals. He was the first editor of the weekly. With the support of Acharya Harihar Das, Pandit Nilakantha Das, Samaja continued to highlight the wrongdoings of British Government, and was imprisoned. In 1928, prior to the death of Gopababndhu, Samaja was handed over to the Servants of People Society (SOPS), a non-profit organization founded by Lala Lajpatrai. In his will, Gopabandhu stated that under SOPS, Samaja would continue to contribute to Societal, political, educational and economic development of Odisha.

Quintus Fulvius Nobilior was a Roman consul who obtained the consulship in 153 BC. 
His father Marcus Fulvius Nobilior and his brother Marcus Fulvius Nobilior (consul 159 BC) were also consuls.
Nobilior and his father were patrons of the writer Quintus Ennius.
Quintus Fulvius Nobilior was in charge of a major military campaign in Spain, which was largely unsuccessful. The Roman army was initially deployed against the "oppidum" of Segeda, whose Celtiberian inhabitants, the Belli, had been strengthening the walls. Segeda was destroyed, but the Belli assembled an army which ambushed the Roman army inflicting heavy losses. Moving west to the meseta, Nobilior laid siege to Numantia, an oppidum whose inhabitants were to give Rome trouble for years.
The Roman army faced difficult conditions in the winter and had to withdraw. Nobilior was replaced as consul in 152 BC by Marcus Claudius Marcellus. 
He was censor with Appius Claudius Pulcher, probably in 136 BC.
The Roman camp at Renieblas in Spain may have been Q. Fulvius Nobilior's winter quarters.

Vitae duorum Offarum

The Vitae duorum Offarum "The lives of the two Offas" is a literary history written in the mid-thirteenth century, apparently by the St Albans monk Matthew Paris.; however, the most recent editor and translator of the work rejects this attribution and argues for an earlier date, in the late twelfth century.
Account.
The text concerns two kings, King Offa of the Angles, a fourth or fifth-century ancestor figure of the Mercians, and King Offa of Mercia (r. 757-796), through whose lives the text recounts the foundation of St Albans Abbey: Offa of Angel made the vow to found a monastery, while several centuries later, his namesake Offa of Mercia executed this plan on discovering the relics of the British martyr king St Alban and built St Albans Abbey. Although some historical elements are interwoven into the story, Matthew had little reliable information to go on and much of the narrative is therefore fictitious.
Of particular interest is that it features the oldest surviving account of the "Constance" tale-type. The king of York tries to marry his daughter; when she refuses, she is abandoned in the woods, where Offa finds her, and he marries her, but later, when he is at war, through a forged letter, she is again abandoned in the woods with her children, and she, Offa, and the children are reunited many years later. This tale was particular popular in chivalric romance such as "The Man of Law's Tale" and "Emaré" in England. Twenty variants are known, including those in French, Latin, German, and Spanish. 
It has been suggested that it is related to the story of Offa and his queen in "Beowulf", but "Beowulf" does not contain sufficient information concerning her to identify her with this tale type; Drida is described as coming to him over water because of her father, but that could mean that she was sent by him, not that she fled him. 
The story contains many fairy tales motifs: the heroine forced to flee an incestous marriage, such as "The She-Bear", "Allerleirauh", "Donkeyskin", and "The King who Wished to Marry His Daughter"; a strange woman found by the king, who marries her, but who is then forced into exile with her children owing to substituted letters, such as "The Girl Without Hands" and "The Armless Maiden"; or a fairy tale featuring both elements, as in "Penta of the Chopped-off Hands".
Manuscripts.
The text is preserved in two manuscripts: 
Previously, Matthew Paris had written another, brief account of Offa of Mercia in his Latin copy of "Vie de Saint Auban" "The Life of St Alban" (verse), preserved in Trinity College Dublin, MS 177, which is also embellished with miniatures portraying selected episodes.

These corporations are known as Prescribed Bodies Corporate (PBCs) as they have prescribed characteristics under the "Native Title Act 1993", including that they are incorporated under the "Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006". Once registered by the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT) as required by the "Native Title Act 1993", they are technically known as Registered Native Title Bodies Corporate (RNTBCs). It is at this point that their statutory obligations under the "Native Title Act 1993" and the Native Title (Prescribed Bodies Corporate) Regulations 1999 are triggered.
In some instances native title claim groups will create a new organisation whose sole purpose is to act as an RNTBC. Alternatively, they may nominate an existing corporation to become the RNTBC as long as it is already incorporated under the CATSI Act and complies with the provisions of the NTA. Importantly, it must have, among its purposes, the purpose of becoming an RNTBC. Where native title groups have received financial settlements, RNTBCs may become part of a corporate structure which can include charitable trusts, companies, and other Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporations, each of which may perform different or similar functions to achieve the objectives of the native title group and some of which may be incorporated under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act) which applies to the broader Australian community.
Adding further complexity to this corporate landscape are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations that are not RNTBCs (often referred to as ‘native title corporations’ or ‘traditional owner corporations’) but which have generated native title outcomes without having a native title determination. This may have occurred in different ways, including under other legislation such as the Victorian Traditional Owner Settlement Act 2010 (Vic), through native title settlements such as the comprehensive South West Native Title Settlement for Noongar people in Western Australia and through native title claimant groups entering into Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUAs).
The kind of bodies that can be determined as PBCs (and therefore registered as RNTBCs) and their functions are set out in the "Native Title Act 1993" and "Native Title (Prescribed Bodies Corporate) Regulations 1999".
Statutory differences between PBCs & other corporations
- RNTBCs and PBCs are special types of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations because they are created especially for common law native title holders to hold or manage native title.
- PBCs must have the words ‘registered native title body corporate’ or ‘RNTBC’ in their name, to signify this and must be registered with ORIC as required by the NTA whilst other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations can choose to register under other state or territory associations law or under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
- PBCs have obligations under the NTA such as the requirement to consult with and obtain consent from native title holders in relation to any decisions which surrender or affect native title rights and interests.
- If an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation becomes or ceases to be a PBC (RNTBC), it must notify the Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporationsexternal sites (ORIC) within 28 days.
- PBC directors and officers are protected from a range of criminal and civil penalties for breach of duties as long as they have acted in good faith in complying with obligations under native title legislation (not including the duty to trade while insolvent).
- PBCs are not required to value their native title rights and interests as part of their assets, for the purpose of determining their size classification under CATSI.
- PBCs must ensure that their constitution is consistent with native title legislation.
- The Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporationsexternal sites (ORIC) must not change the PBC’s constitution on the basis of an act done in good faith and with the belief that the corporation or its officers are complying with native title legislation.
The Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporationsexternal sites (ORIC) is not able to de-register an PBC as long as it remains an PBC and manages or holds native title interests.

Don Hudson

Donald Edward Hudson (born November 20, 1929) is a former American football player and coach in the United States. He served as the head football coach at Macalester College from 1972 to 1975 and at Lincoln University of Missouri from 1976 to 1979, compiling a career college football record of 9–72–2. When he was hired at Macalester, Hudson became first African American head football coach at a predominantly white college.
He became the head coach in December 1971 when his predecessor, Dick Borstad, resigned. Macalester College barely publicized the milestone. As a result other universities, like Portland State and Oberlin College, later were reported to have hired the first African American college football coach. Don Hudson was most recently recognized for his breakthrough at half time of a Macalester game in October 2007. He was a quarterback for Lincoln University of Missouri and an assistant coach there through the fifties and sixties. He was soon offered a head coaching job at Minneapolis Central High School where he was the first African American coach in that school’s league. He then took a coaching and teaching job at predominantly white Macalester College in 1971. He went 3–36 in his first four seasons as head coach of Macalester. He eventually moved on from Macalester after a losing effort, but he was able to break through the racial barrier in college football. He was a pioneer and paved the way for future African American coaches in modern college football.

Cromemco Dazzler

Cromemco's Dazzler (or TV DAZZLER) was a graphics card for S-100 bus computers. Released in 1976, it is the first commercial graphics card available for microcomputers. Multiple Dazzler cards could be installed in a single machine and synched together, a feature which could, with minor modification, be used to genlock. Genlocked Dazzler cards drove ColorGraphics Weather Systems displays that generated most of the weather imagery seen on US television in the early 1980s.
History.
The Dazzler came about in a roundabout fashion after Les Solomon, an editor for "Popular Electronics" magazine, demonstrated the original Altair 8800 to Roger Melen of Stanford University. After seeing it, Melen purchased Altair #2 for his friend Harry Garland to work with. The two built a number of add-ons for the machine, starting with an early video digitizer called the Cyclops and then moving on to the prototype Dazzler. The Dazzler was first introduced at the Homebrew Computer Club on November 12, 1975.
Like many early microcomputer projects of the era, the Dazzler was originally announced as a self-built kit in "Popular Electronics". In order to "kick start" construction, they offered kits including a circuit board and the required parts, which the user would then assemble on their own. This led to sales of completely assembled Dazzler systems, which became the only way to purchase the product some time after. Sales were so fruitful that Melen and Garland formed Cromemco to sell the Dazzler and their other Altair add-ons, selecting a name based on Crothers Memorial Hall, their residence while attending Stanford.
When Federico Faggin's new company introduced the Z80, Cromemco branched out into their own line of Z80-based S-100 compatible computers almost immediately. Over time these became the company's primary products. Combinations of their rackmount machines and the Dazzler formed the basis of ColorGraphics Weather Systems (CWS) product line into the late 1980s, and when CWS was purchased by Dynatech in 1987, Dynatech also purchased Cromemco to supply them.
Dazzler Software.
The original advertisement for the Dazzler offered three different software programs for sale (provided on punched paper tape.) These were Conway's Game of Life, Dazzlewriter (an alphanumeric display) and a colorful pattern-generating program, Kaleidoscope.
The cover of the June 1976 issue of Byte Magazine shows a Dazzler image from Conway's Game of Life, and credits Ed Hall as author of the Life software for the Dazzler. Byte also credits Steve Dompier with authoring the animation tool "Dazzlemation" and the first animation made with Dazzlemation called "Magenta Martini". George Tate (who later co-founded Ashton-Tate) is credited with a Tic-Tac-Toe game for the Dazzler, and Li-Chen Wang is credited as the author of "Kaleidoscope".
Stan Veit, owner of the Computer Mart of New York, described the reaction when he displayed the changing patterns of Kaleidoscope on a color television in his store window at the corner of 5th Avenue and 32nd Street in New York City in early 1976. “People driving by began to stop and look – they had never seen anything like it before. In a short time the Dazzler had caused a traffic jam on 5th Avenue!” The police had to contact the building landlord and make him disconnect the television.
Over time, Cromemco introduced additional software for the Dazzler, at first on paper tape and later floppy disk, including "Spacewar!" in October 1976. Cromemco customers also developed software for a wide range of graphics applications, from monitoring the manufacturing processes at a coffee factory in Columbia to displaying real-time images of heart blood flow, generated through cardiac radionuclide imaging, in Scotland.
Dazzler Hardware.
The Dazzler used over 70 MOS and TTL IC's, which required two cards to hold all the chips, "Board 1" held the analog circuits, while "Board 2" held the bus interface and digital logic. The two cards were connected together with a 16-conductor ribbon cable. Although the analog card did not talk on the bus, it would normally be plugged into the bus for power connections and physical support within the chassis. The manual also described a way to "piggyback" the two cards with a separate power cable to save a slot. Output from the analog card was composite color, and an RF modulator was available for direct connection to a color TV.
The Dazzler lacked its own frame buffer, accessing the host machine's main memory using a custom DMA controller that provided 1 Mbit/s throughput. The card read data from the computer at speeds that demanded the use of SRAM memory, as opposed to lower cost DRAMs. Control signals and setup was sent and received using the S-100 bus's input/output "ports", normally mapped to 0E and 0F. 0E contained an 8-bit address pointing to the base of the frame buffer in main memory, while 0F was a bit-mapped control register with various setup information.
The Dazzler supported four graphics modes in total, selected by setting or clearing bits in the control register (0F) that controlled two orthogonal selections. The first selected the size of the frame buffer, either 512 bytes or 2 kB. The other selected normal or "X4" mode, the former using 4-bit nybbles packed 2 to a byte in the frame buffer to produce a 8-color image, or the latter which was a higher resolution monochrome mode using 1-bits per pixel, 8 to a byte. Selecting the mode indirectly selected the resolution. In normal mode with a 512 byte buffer there would be 512 bytes × 2 pixels per byte = 1,024 pixels, arranged as a 32 by 32 pixel image. A 2 kB buffer produced a 64 by 64 pixel image, while the highest resolution used a 2 kB buffer in X4 mode to produce a 128 by 128 pixel image. In normal mode the color was selected from a fixed 8-color palette with an additional bit selecting intensity, while in X4 mode the foreground color was selected by setting three bits in the control register to turn on red, green or blue (or combinations) while a separate bit controlled the intensity.
Super Dazzler.
In 1979 Cromemco replaced the original Dazzler with the “Super Dazzler”. The Super Dazzler Interface (SDI) had 756 x 484 pixel resolution with the capability to display up to 4096 colors. Dedicated two-port memory cards were used for image storage for higher performance. While the original Dazzler had a composite video output signal, the new SDI used separate RGB component video outputs for higher resolution. The SDI also had the ability to be synchronized to other video equipment. Cromemco systems with the SDI board became the systems of choice for television broadcast applications, and were widely deployed by the United States Air Force as Mission Support Systems.

Online Media.
Global Tolerance aims to utilize online media to enhance human connections and promote social change with creative and memorable campaigns for their clients. This is done through tools such as websites, social media, virtual conversations, "spiral videos", widgets and online applications.
Communications Training.
Global Tolerance offers communication training sessions for their clients in order to empower these social change makers and equip them with the tools to effectively communicate their work to the general public via the media. Training includes advocacy work, media skills, press releases and broadcast training. In addition, Global Tolerance utilizes their relationships with leading journalists from around the world who provide insights into the media world and how to successfully sell one's social story. Other clients include The Gallup Organization, Wallace & Gromit's Children Foundation, Unpackaged, a sustainable packaging movement, the HH Dalai Lama, and Gandhi's Grandson, Arun Gandhi.
Tole-rants.
"Tole-rants" is a program created by Global Tolerance as an online forum for people from around the world to rant about social issues and propose solutions in a 60-second video. Once videos are uploaded and submitted by users, they are entered in the annual Tole-rants competition. The winner of the competition is awarded with year-long media, communications and PR support from Global Tolerance. Last year's inaugural winner was a 12-year old boy whose tole-rant was a plea for the planet and his charity Plant for the Planet.

Sangai

The Sangai is an endemic, rare and endangered Brow-antlered deer found only in Manipur, India. It is also state animal of Manipur. Its common English name is Manipur Brow-antlered Deer and the scientific name, "Rucervus eldii eldii" McClelland. It lives in the marshy wetland in Keibul Lamjao about 45 km from Imphal. Its habitat is located in the southern parts of the Loktak Lake, which is the largest freshwater lake in Eastern India. It is also one of the seven Ramsar sites of international importance. The habitat of the Sangai is now protected as the Keibul Lamjao National Park. Sangai is also the state animal of Manipur.
Distribution and habitat.
The brow-antlered deer or the dancing deer is found in its natural habitat only at Keibul Lamjao National Park over the floating biomass locally called "phumdi" in the South Eastern part of Loktak Lake. It is located between 24°27’ N and 24°31’ N latitude and 93°53’ E and 93°55’ E longitudes. The park covers an area of 40 km². and the home range of the deer in the park is confined to 15–20 km².
Phumdi is the most important and unique part of the habitat. It is the floating mass of entangled vegetation formed by the accumulation of organic debris and biomass with soil. Its thickness varies from few centimeter to two meters. The humus of phumdi is black in color and very spongy with large number of pores. It floats with 4/5 part under water.
The number of deer listed in the Red data book was only 14 in 1975. Subsequent after the declaration of the area as National park and with strict conservation measures taken up by the Forest Department, the fear of its extinction has been greatly reduced.
Biology and behavior.
The Brow-antlered deer is a medium-sized deer, with uniquely distinctive antlers, measuring 100–110 cm. in length with extremely long brow tine, which form the main beam. The two tines form a continuous curve at right angles to the closely set pedicels. This signifies its name, brow-antlered deer, the forward protruding beam appears to come out from the eyebrow. The antlers of the opposite sides are unsymmetrical with respect to each other. The beams are unbranched initially whereas curvature increases as length increases and they get forked also. The sexes are moderately dimorphic in body size and weight. The height and weight of a fully grown stag may be approximately 115–125 cm at shoulder and 95 to 110 kg (210 to 230 lb) respectively. The height and weight of the female are shorter and less as compared to the male counterpart. The length of the body from the base to the ear up to the tail is about 145 to 155 cm in both sexes. The tail is short and rump patch is not pronounced.
Sangai feed on a variety of water living plants, grasses, herbaceous plants, and shoots. "Zizania latifolia", "Saccharum munja", "S. bengalensis", "Erianthus procerus", "E. ravernnae", etc. are the favorite food plants of Sangai. Feeding behavior of Sangai can be easily seen over new shoots on freshly cut fire line area. It exhibits a bimodial activity pattern. Sangai starts grazing usually early morning approximately 4:30 am and generally continue up to 8:00 am. On cloudy morning the period may extend to 10:00 am. In the evening it starts at 3:00 pm and continue up to 6:00 pm. After feeding it takes rest. During day time it rests under thick and tall reeds and grasses. At night some of them even rest on the hillocks.
Sangai has a maximum lifespan in the wild of around 10 years.
Rutting takes place in the early spring months between February and May. Males compete with each other to gain control of a harem of females that they can then mate with. After a 220 to 240-day-long gestation period, normally a single calf is born. The young are spotted at birth; these spots fade as the animal grows. The young are weaned at 7 months of age, and becomes sexually mature from 18 months of age onwards.
Sangai in Manipur society.
Culturally, the Sangai finds itself imbedded deep into the legends and folklore of the Manipuris. Based on a popular folk legend, the Sangai is interpreted as the binding soul between humans and the nature. The slaying of the Sangai, an unpardonable sin, is conceived as the rude breaking up of the cordial relationship between humans and the nature. When humans love and respect the Sangai, it is respecting nature. In the Sangai, therefore, humans find a way of expressing their love for the nature. Socially, the Sangai is the symbol of a prized possession of the State.
It is believed that the name Sangai (Sa, animal and ngai, in awaiting) was coined from its peculiar posture and behaviour while running. By nature, the deer, particularly the males, even when running for its life stops occasionally and looks back as if he is waiting for someone and hence the name.
According to a Manipuri folklore, a legendary hero Kadeng Thangjahanba of Moirang once captured a gravid Sangai from Torbung Lamjao for a gift to his beloved Tonu Laijinglembi during an animal hunting expedition. However, as fate would have it, he found his beloved married to the king on his return. The heartbroken hero released the deer free in the wild of Keibul Lamjao. From that time onwards the place became the home of Sangai.
In another folklore of Manipur, a prince called Pudangkoi of Luwang clan had, by the grace of a divine entity, transformed himself into a deer which has later on called Sangai. Further, there were references of Sangai head with crown of antlers, being decorated on the head of royal boat called Hiyang Hiren.
Identified as one of the rarest animal species in the entire world, the Sangai is the apple of the eye for the people. Talk of Manipur, and one of the first things to introduce the State is the Sangai, other than polo, its classical dance, sports and films.
Danger of extinction.
The Sangai was believed to be almost extinct by 1950. However, in 1953 six heads of the Sangai were found hovering at its natural habitat. Since then, the State Government has taken serious and positive measures for the protection of this rare and endangered species. A census conducted in 2000 in the park showed that there were just 162 deer (54 stags, 76 hinds and 32 fawns).
The Sangai faces a two-pronged danger to its life. Firstly, its habitat is steadily degenerating by reason of continuous inundation and flooding by high water caused as the result of artificial reservoir of the Loktak hydroelectric power project. Secondly, poachers are out there to trap and slay the deer at the slightest opportunity.
In 1983 the 103 megawatt capacity Loktak hydroelectric power project was commissioned with the objective of ensuring rapid development in the State. A maximum high water level of above mean sea level (MSL)is maintained in the Loktak Lake to feed the reservoir for the hydel project. This high water level had wreaked havoc in the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The high water level, maintained continuously through the year, had disturbed the natural life cycle of the vegetation growth, the phumdi, upon which the Sangai thrives. The deer feed on several types of vegetation that grow on the phumdi. The vegetation also provides shelter to the deer and other wildlife in the park.
The life-cycle of the phumdi involves floating on the water surface during season of high water as in the monsoons. In the lean season, when the water level reduces, the biomass come into contact with the lake bed and they secure the required nutrient from there. When the rains come again and they become afloat, the biomass have enough 'food'—the nutrients—stored in their roots and their life continues. What is happening now, according to local scientists who are studying the phenomena, is that with continuous high water in the lake throughout the year much of this process of 'feeding' on the nutrient in the lakebed had discontinued. The result—the biomass are losing weight and getting thinner by the year. Around January last week in 1999, it was reported that a large chunk of the biomass in the northern part of National Park had broken up into pieces and had drifted freely from the park area. This was a bad sign for the Sangai habitat. It spelled out very clearly that the beginning of the end of the Sangai habitat had begun. There are reports of local people cutting up the phumdi into sizable pieces and then towing away these with dugout canoe for 'selling' to fish culture owners. This is another potential danger to the Sangai habitat. It meant humans are now aiding the process of annihilating the habitat area, supplementing to the rapid degeneration of the habitat.

Bill Winter (American football)

William Richard Winter (born July 9, 1943, Nitro, WV) is a former Marshall University football player.
High school career.
Winter graduated in 1961 from Nitro High School and is one of the greatest athletes the school has ever produced. As a member of the 1958 football team, Nitro went 9-0-1 for their first undefeated season in school history (the team also featured his older brother Wilbur who played fullback and would captain the team one year later). Bill Winter was a key player in Nitro High School's 1960 season in which they went 10-0 in the regular season, outscoring their opponents 258-44. Nitro played in the West Virginia AAA state championship game. The Nitro Wildcats ultimately lost to Weir by a score of 40-0. This was Nitro High School's first appearance in a state football championship game. Winter was named to the All AAA West Virginia State Second Team. Of note, Winter's youngest brother Tom would also play linebacker and guard for the Nitro High School football team from 1964–1966; during this span, the team would go 8-22.
College career.
Winter went on to play college football at Marshall University. He received numerous offers at other schools including West Virginia University. He enjoyed a successful career playing on offense (guard), defense (linebacker), and on special teams (kick-off team and kicking PATs). Winter was one of only 4 sophomores to start for Marshall in 1962. He broke his ankle during the next to last game of the season against Xavier. After the game, Marshall head coach Charley Snyder remarked, "That boy is the greatest sophomore football player I've ever coached." He was named to the All Mid-American Conference 2nd Team in 1963. During this season, Marshall finished at 5-4-1, for their first winning season since 1957 and only their second since joining the MAC in 1954. In 1964, Winter was named captain of the team along with teammate Jim Cure. Marshall would have its best football season during its first tenure in the MAC (1954–1968), finishing 7-3 and 2nd in the Mid-American Conference. During this season, Winter was named to the 1964 All Mid-American Conference Team. After Winter's departure, Marshall would post a 7-31-1 record during their last 4 seasons in the MAC, going winless in the last two seasons (1967–68).
In 1990, Winter was inducted into the "Marshall University Hall of Fame". One year later, he would be named to the Marshall University Field of Dreams team during the dedication of Marshall University Stadium. The Thundering Herd defeated New Hampshire in that game before a crowd of 33,116.
Professional career.
Winter was evaluated by several NFL/AFL teams including the Dallas Cowboys who felt he was too small to play his position. He would eventually be drafted by the Charleston (W.Va.) Rockets of the Continental Football League in 1965. Head coach Perry Moss said of Winter, "There's a real football player." "He sure came to play. I'd like to have more like him." Winter would see playing time as a linebacker against Fort Wayne (The Rockets would win 24-7) in a preseason game. Winter would leave the game early secondary to a laceration. He would later narrowly miss the final cut for the team. The Charleston Rockets would go undefeated at 14-0 in 1965 and defeat the Toronto Rifles 24-7 in the first Continental Football League championship game.
The following year, new Rockets Head Coach Sam Fernandez was reportedly interested in recruiting Winter back to the team saying, "At that time he was cut, he just needed more experience. I feel he has the potential to be a fine pro player."
Coaching career.
After college, Winter coached football at Andrew Lewis High School in Salem, VA beginning in 1967. He was coaching at Andrew Lewis High School during the 1971 Virginia State Championship game depicted in the film Remember the Titans. The real championship game was much less dramatic than the movie version with Andrew Lewis falling to T.C. Williams High School 27-0. Winter went on to coach at Roanoke Catholic School and Salem High School in Salem, VA when it opened in 1977. He was an assistant coach for the Virginia Hunters, a semi-pro team. His coaching career would end in the 1980s.

Bidens vulgata

Bidens vulgata is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family known by the common name big devils beggartick. It is native to eastern North America, where it is a plant of wetlands. It is an introduced species in much of western North America as well as parts of Europe. This is an annual herb producing a hairy stem which generally grows 30 to 50 centimeters tall but often grows much taller, exceeding one meter. The leaves are made up of several lance-shaped leaflets each up to 8 centimeters long. The inflorescence produces small flower heads with centers of yellow disc florets and a fringe of 3 to 5 yellow ray florets a few millimeters in length. Some heads lack ray florets. The fruit is a flattened achene with two sharp barbs at one end.

Solid oxide electrolyser cell

A solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC) is a solid oxide fuel cell that runs in regenerative mode to achieve the electrolysis of water and which uses a solid oxide, or ceramic, electrolyte to produce oxygen and hydrogen gas.
Principle.
Solid oxide electrolyzer cells operate at temperatures which allow high-temperature electrolysis to occur, typically between 500 and 850 °C. These operating temperatures are similar to those conditions for an SOFC. The net cell reaction yields hydrogen and oxygen gases. The reactions for one mole of water are shown below, with oxidation of water occurring at the anode and reduction of water occurring at the cathode.
Anode: H2O ---> 1/2O2 + 2H+ + 2e-
Cathode: 2H2O + 2e- ---> H2 + 2OH-
Net Reaction: H2O ---> H2 + 1/2O2
Electrolysis of water at 298 K (25 °C) requires 285.83 kJ of energy in order to occur, and the reaction is increasingly endothermic with increasing temperature. However, the energy demand may be reduced due to the Joule heating of an electrolysis cell, which may be utilized in the water splitting process at high temperatures. Research is ongoing to add heat from external heat sources such as concentrating solar thermal collectors and geothermal sources.
Considerations.
Advantages of solid oxide-based regenerative fuel cells include high efficiencies, as they are not limited by Carnot efficiency.
Additional advantages include long-term stability, fuel flexibility, low emissions, and low operating costs. However, the greatest disadvantage is the high operating temperature, which results in long start-up times and break-in times. The high operating temperature also leads to mechanical compatibility issues such as thermal expansion mismatch and chemical stability issues such as diffusion between layers of material in the cell
In principle, the process of any fuel cell could be reversed, due to the inherent reversibility of chemical reactions.
However, a given fuel cell is usually optimized for operating in one mode and may not be built in such a way that it can be operated in reverse. Fuel cells operated backwards may not make very efficient systems unless they are constructed to do so such as in the case of solid oxide electrolyzer cells, high pressure electrolyzers, unitized regenerative fuel cells and regenerative fuel cells. However, current research is being conducted to investigate systems in which a solid oxide cell may be run in either direction efficiently.
Applications.
SOECs have possible application in fuel production, carbon dioxide recycling, and chemicals synthesis. In addition to the production of hydrogen and oxygen, an SOEC could be used to create syngas by electrolyzing water vapor and carbon dioxide.
This conversion could be useful for energy generation and energy storage applications.

Envy (English rapper)

Nicola Varley (born 9 April 1987), known as Envy, is an English rapper/MC.
Envy has been writing songs for over 5 years. At first being compared to other female artists around, she carved out her own niche in the predominantly male British Grime Scene. She first began to make waves when she made several show-stealing appearances on 'The City Is Ours Music Mixtapes' from Manchester. This led to several collaborations with artists from all over the UK, particularly London, where she earned respect by battling and profilically dropping verses on many singles. She released her debut solo single Tongue Twister through StopStart Records.
Having graduated from Loughborough University with a degree in Media, Envy now concentrates on her music career full-time with the fruits of her labour bouncing onto the scene in the form of second single Friday Night
"Her lyrics, if you can hear them (you might need a vari-speed facility), are well smart, with the wry, pithy intelligence of the media-savvy: "I take it tit for tat/I'll take your tacit consent/To turn the Taliban to take over your town… You're lookin' to be loved but can't find a flippin' solution/I'm lost on location, laceratin' as I'm lacin'/Lookin' lovely/Better pray your label pay for elocution," she rapid-fires over the bubblicious grime rhythms, with their shades of Missy's Work It, of previous single Tongue Twister. We're not sure what she means or who the subject is of her ire here, but as ever she sounds fierce yet witty, her staccato delivery popping in time to the buzzing, fizzing synth beat. In fact, so rhythmic is her phrasing that it would sound good acappella, but it works both ways: remove her rhymes and you've got pristine future-perfect electro-pop."

List of Saint Seiya chapters (series)

"Saint Seiya" is a Japanese manga written and drawn by Masami Kurumada. The plot follows a teenager named Seiya who becomes one of the 88 soldiers for the goddess Athena, named Saints. The Saints have the ability to use energy from the universe, and use it to fight against any person who attacks Athena.
The individual chapters were published by Shueisha in the magazine "Weekly Shōnen Jump" from January 1986 to December 1990. They were also and compiled into 28 "tankōbon" volumes. The first volume was released on September 1986, and volume 28 was released on April 1991. In addition to the original volumes, the series has been reissued four times. The first reissue was in 1995 with the "Aizōban" the "Collector's Version". The second reissue was as 15 "bunkoban" volumes in 2001 called the "Library Version". The first eighteen volumes of the manga series were adapted into a 114-episode anime series by Toei Animation, while a series of OVAs adapted the following volumes in 31 episodes.
The series was re-released in 2003 in 19 volumes with Setteis from the anime adaptation called the "Remix Version". The fourth reissue, in 22 volumes, called the "Complete Version" which contains additional colored pages as well as colored armor schematics. In addition, the "Remix Version" was republished at the end of 2007 to coincide with the broadcast of Chapter Elysion of the anime. Viz Media has licensed the manga for release in North America under their "Shonen Jump" imprint. Shonen Jump has changed the covers and added "Knights of the Zodiac" to the volumes to make "Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac". The first volume of the series was released on January 21, 2004 and as of February 2, 2010 all twenty-eight volumes have been released.

Tiutchev (horse)

Tiutchev was an English racehorse who started his racing career as a Flat horse for trainer Roger Charlton. He made his debut in September 1996 in a Haydock maiden, where he finished 6th. He went on to have two further runs for Roger Charlton, before being transferred to the yard of National Hunt trainer Henrietta Knight, for he made his debut when finishing 4th in maiden hurdle at Warwick in February 1997. He failed to shine in his next 3 races, where he fell and then unseated his rider in the next 2. He ended the season on an improved note however, as he was placed in his next 2 runs.
He then changed yards again during the summer of 1997, when he joined trainer David Nicholson. He made a winning debut for him in a Novices' Hurdle in October 1997 and followed that up with another victory at Cheltenham in November. He had mixed fortunes in his next 3 starts, of which he won one, was runner up in one and fell in the other. But he bounced back to the Lanzarote Hurdle at Kempton in January 1999. Following that win, he was sent off 6/4 favourite for the Tote Gold Trophy, but disappointed by finishing 6th, which he followed by filling the same position in the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham, behind Istabraq. In his final of the season, he was sent off the favourite for the Welsh Champion Hurdle, but could only finish 2nd.
He then changed yards again in the summer of 1999, as he joined the yard of Nicky Henderson. He was sent straight over fences, and it was here under Henderson that Tiutchev really excelled and proved himself to be the Champion Novice Chaser in the 1999/00 season. Although he only gained 4 more successes after that season, he ran creditably in numerous Grade 1 Chases including for Martin Pipe, who he joined in 2003. After a distinguished racing career, Tiutchev was finally retired after being pulled up in the 2005 Betfair Bowl at Aintree.

Pierre Baigorry (born 3 September 1971), better known as Peter Fox, also known as Enuff and Pete Fox, is a German reggae and Hip hop musician from Berlin. He is also a member of the German reggae and dancehall band Seeed.
Solo career.
Peter Fox started working on a solo album named "Stadtaffe" ("Urban Ape") in 2007. The album was released in Germany on the 26th of September 2008. All songs are in German. Monk and DJ Illvibe co-produced the album, and the Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg, as well as the Cold Steel Drumline contributed to the music.
A sample of the song "Fieber" ("Fever"), which Fox sings with K.I.Z., was released on Fox's MySpace website on 1 November 2007. The first single, "Alles neu" ("Everything New"), was released on August 15, 2008. The second single of the album, "Haus am See" ("House By The Lake"), was released on October 17, 2008.
Fox also had several gigs with other artists, such as the song "Marry Me" by Miss Platnum, "Rodeo" by Sido and "Sekundenschlaf" by Marteria.
Peter Fox won the Bundesvision Song Contest 2009 on February 13 with his song "Schwarz zu blau" ("Black to Blue"), which is a social realistic representation of his home city Berlin and the transition from nightlife to dawn. The contest was held in Potsdam (the state capital of the previous year's winner Brandenburg).
He has since announced that he will be returning to Seeed due to unwanted stress and attention generated by his highly successful solo album Stadtaffe.
His single "Haus am See" was the 82nd best-selling single of 2008 and the 17th best-selling single of 2009 in Germany.
His single "Alles Neu" has been sampled by British musician Plan B for the track "Ill Manors" and by Fall Out Boy in their single "The Phoenix".
Personal life.
Peter Fox played the horn in his youth. He lives with his family in Berlin-Kreuzberg. In late 2001, Fox suffered from facial nerve paralysis that was not treated quickly enough because of a false diagnosis. The right side of his face still has a slight paralysis; however, that has become his own special signature.

<doc id="20594990" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20594990" title="Gayhurst School">
Gayhurst School

Gayhurst School Trust is a preparatory school in Buckinghamshire, England.
Description.
Situated on the edge of the town in twelve acres of playing fields and woodland, the school is co-educational; girls were introduced to Nursery, Reception, and Year 7 from September 2008.
The current Headmaster is Mr. A. Sims, who joined the school in the early 1990s.
School Houses.
There are four school houses. They are Campbell, Stafford, Taylor and Gibbs. These houses are named after the previous headmasters except Campbell who was a deputy head.
School Subjects.
The school has a varied curriculum. The school subjects are English, Maths, Science, Geography, History, R.S, Music, Art, Drama, IT, French and Latin.
Sport.
Games and activities are an integral part of life at Gayhurst. The sports' facilities have been considerably enhanced by the recent construction of an all-weather Astroturf surface. The chief sports for the boys are Rugby, Soccer and Cricket but Hockey, Tennis, Athletics and Swimming are also important and are timetabled into the working week. For the girls the main sports will be Netball, Hockey, Swimming, Gymnastics, Rounders, Ballet and Dance but they too will have the opportunity to participate in other sports that take place at the school.
Facilities.
The school has a great range of facilities. It has a science labs, cricket squares, playing fields, large woods, a new cricket pavilion, a school hall, a medical centre and an astroturf.
The Nursery.
The new Nursery was opened in September 2008, as Gayhurst became a co-educational school.
The Junior School.
The Junior School is for children from 4 to 8 years of age. It has benefited from two recent building projects and now has modern, well-equipped classrooms, individual tuition rooms, IT resource and activity rooms, a Junior library, all-weather playground and an adventure playground. The children arrive in Reception at rising-five as part of two non-selective parallel classes. Class sizes are small. The Reception groups have approximately sixteen children. Classroom assistants help with all the year groups but particularly with the youngest children. Entry into the Reception classes is by registration. There are no interview procedures at this young age. The parents of children registered for entry into Reception are contacted approximately eleven months before to confirm their acceptance of a place. . Entry higher up the school would normally include some test procedures and a reference in the Autumn term. However tests for children whose families are relocating to the area take place throughout the year. Children in the Junior School are taught most of their subjects by their form teacher although specialist staff teach them for Music, PE and Games.
The Senior School.
At eight years of age the children transfer to the Senior School where they are gradually introduced to specialist subject teaching. The Senior School too has recently been completely rebuilt. There are ten subject teaching rooms, a new Art and Design room, Library, two modern Science laboratories, a Music suite and a fully equipped, purpose built computer laboratory. By nine years of age all the children would be expected to move to and from the various specialist subject classrooms during each teaching day. In this respect the 45 period, weekly timetable resembles that of a secondary school which the children enjoy and find stimulating. Heads of Subject Departments are in close liaison with the Junior School staff. There is a Head of Junior School, a Head of Middle School, a Director of Sport and Activities and a Deputy Head Teacher, all of whom meet with parents regularly and who, at various stages, are involved in the overall development of the boys and girls.
There are three parallel forms in Year 4 but at this stage the children are formally setted in English and Mathematics. In Years 7 and 8 the children are streamed. Science is taught in modules of Physics, Chemistry and Biology and the French becomes more academic although there is still a considerable emphasis on spoken French. All the children are introduced to Classics in Year 4 while the upper stream also studies Spanish in the last two years at Gayhurst. History, Geography, Religious Studies, Art/Design, I.T. and Music are all taught by subject specialists.
Boys and girls are prepared for a wide range of secondary schools both boarding and day, maintained and independent. The Headmaster is always happy to discuss the range of secondary schools that might be best for your son or daughter. Where it is appropriate the school might recommend that a child sits for scholarship which may be academic, musical, artistic or sporting. Gayhurst has a long record of success in such examinations which are extremely rigorous.
Religion.
Gayhurst was founded as a Church of England school. Today it retains that emphasis and Christian values and perceptions remain a central feature of the school's philosophy. School assemblies are held daily and conducted along Christian lines. Gayhurst enjoys close links with St James' Church in Gerrards Cross where it holds its annual Carol services.
Gayhurst is truly a multi-denominational school.
Hugh Henry.
On 4 December 2011, Hugh Henry (80) who was a teacher at Gayhurst School in the 1950s, was charged together with Roland Peter Wright, the former Head Master of Caldicott School, with child sex offences alleged to have taken place between 1959 and 1970. They appeared in court in Aylesbury on 17 February 2012. [http://www.amershampeople.co.uk/Amersham-news-Hugh-Henry-80-court-today/story-15714863-detail/story.html]
Hugh Henry, 82, of Pomeroy Close, Amersham, was due to be sentenced alongside Wright on 6th February 2014 after previously admitting 11 counts of indecency with or towards a child, and two of gross indecency with a child, but Henry is believed to have killed himself by jumping in front of a train two days before he was due to be sentenced for sex crimes. 
A British Transport Police (BTP) spokeswoman said: "BTP officers were called to the line close to Amersham London Underground (LU) station on Tuesday, 4 February after a report that a man had been struck by a train. Henry was due to be sentenced with Roland Peter Wright, 83, from Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire, who assaulted five pupils aged eight to 13 at Caldicott Boys' Preparatory School between 1959 and 1970. An inquest is being held.

Blennosperma bakeri

Blennosperma bakeri is a rare species of flowering plant in the daisy family known by the common names Baker's stickyseed and Sonoma sunshine. It is endemic to Sonoma County, California, where it is known from a few remaining vernal pool sites on the wet grasslands of the Laguna de Santa Rosa and Sonoma Valley. It is a federally listed endangered species. It is found alongside other rare vernal pool plants including the Sebastopol meadowfoam, "Limnanthes vinculans", and Burke's goldfields, "Lasthenia burkei". Threats to its survival include the alteration of its habitat for development, road maintenance, grazing, and agriculture, as well as collecting, herbivory by thrips, and invasive plants.
This is a small annual herb under 30 centimeters tall. The leaves are 5 to 15 centimeters long and linear in shape with lobes near the ends. The inflorescence bears a few flower heads. Each head contains a center of yellow disc florets, some of which bear prominent white stigmas and white pollen. Around the edge of the head is a fringe of yellow ray florets with red stigmas. The fruit is an achene a few millimeters long which becomes sticky when wet.
The plant is known from fifteen occurrences, but six of these may be degraded or destroyed. Several artificial vernal pools have been created to increase the numbers of the plant, but the United States Fish and Wildlife Service does not consider these an adequate replacement for natural pools.

Hyperkinetic disorder

Hyperkinetic disorder is a psychiatric syndrome emerging in early childhood featuring an enduring pattern of severe, developmentally inappropriate inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity across different settings (e.g., home and school) that significantly impair academic, social and work performance.
Hyperkinetic children display disorganized, poorly-controlled and excessive activity; they lack perseverance in tasks involving thought and attention, and tend to move from one to another activity without completing any. They are frequently accident-prone, reckless and impulsive, and may thoughtlessly (rather than defiantly) break rules. While they are commonly incautious and unreserved with adults, with other children they are unpopular and may be isolated. Cognitive impairment and delayed language and motor development are more common in this group than in the general population; and they may experience low self-esteem and engage in dissocial behavior as a consequence of the disorder.
Diagnosis.
Though the American Psychiatric Association's criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and the World Health Organization's criteria for hyperkinetic disorder each list a very similar set of 18 symptoms, the differing rules governing diagnosis mean that hyperkinetic disorder features greater impairment and more impulse-control difficulties than typical ADHD, and it most resembles a severe case of ADHD combined type.
Unlike ADHD, a diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder requires that the clinician directly observes the symptoms (rather than relying only on parent and teacher reports); that onset must be by age 6 not 7; and that at least six inattention, three hyperactivity and one impulsivity symptom be present in two or more settings. While ADHD may exist comorbid with (in the presence of) mania or a depressive or anxiety disorder, the presence of one of these rules out a diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder. Most cases of hyperkinetic disorder appear to meet the broader criteria of ADHD.
Hyperkinetic disorder may exist comorbid with conduct disorder, in which case the diagnosis is hyperkinetic conduct disorder.
Epidemiology.
The prevalence in school age children is thought to be about 1.5%, compared with an estimated 5.3% for ADHD.
Treatment.
Once the patient and family have been educated about the nature, management and treatment of the disorder and a decision has been made to treat, the European ADHD Guidelines group recommends medication rather than behavioral training as the first treatment approach; and the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends medication as first line treatment for those with severe ADHD, and the provision of group parent-training in all cases of ADHD.

Vincent Moon

Vincent Moon (real name Mathieu Saura, born August 25, 1979) is an independent filmmaker from Paris. He was the main director of the Blogotheque's Take Away Shows, a web-based project recording field work music videos of indie rock related musicians as well as some notable mainstream artists like Tom Jones, R.E.M., or Arcade Fire. For the past five years, Vincent Moon has been traveling around the globe with a camera in his backpack, documenting local folklores, sacred music and religious rituals, for his label Collection Petites Planètes. He works alone or with people he finds on the road, and most of the time without money involved in the projects, trying to produce and distribute films without following the established industry standards. He shares all his work, films and music recordings, for free on internet, under Creative Commons licence.
Early Period (2000-2005).
Growing up in Paris, Vincent Moon studied photography for 3 years at the Atelier Reflexe in Montreuil, where he met the photographers Michael Ackerman and Antoine d’Agata, who informed Vincent Moon’s experiments of style//approach and visual experiments. Working as a photographer at the time, he used to put his photos in motion, using simple slideshow techniques and music to tell stories. In 2003, he started the photography blog Les Nuits de Fiume, documenting Parisian nightlife.
As a result of his encounter with the work of experimental filmmakers Peter Tscherkassky and Stephen Dwoskin, Vincent Moon started to move toward films in 2005. He made short films, mixing intimate storytelling experiment with various techniques, from super 8 to cellphone cameras. He was quick to grasp the various possibilities the internet offered for releasing and sharing his work online and freely. Getting closer and closer to the music world, he encountered the band The National in one of their shows in Paris. Their friendship gave birth to various projects, his photos being used on the cover of The National’s third album, 'Alligator', and he made for them 2 music videos. At this time, he also initiated other projects related to music, directing lo-fi videos for Clogs, Sylvain Chauveau and Barzin.
The Take Away Shows Period (2006-2009).
In 2006, inspired by the film Step Across the Border on the English guitarist Fred Frith and pushed by its desire to record music in a more creative way, he created with Christophe 'Chryde' Abric the 'Concert à Emporter / Take Away Shows' project, La Blogotheque's popular video podcast. The Take Away Shows is a series of improvised outdoor video sessions with musicians, set in unexpected locations and broadcast freely on the web. In four years, they managed to shoot over two hundred videos with bands like REM, Arcade Fire, Sufjan Stevens, Tom Jones, Beirut, Grizzly Bear, and Sigur Ros and many more, always in the field of rock and pop music, mostly focused on north-american music. Vincent Moon perfected his style: an immediately recognizable intimacy, always with fragile and dancing long shots, often filmed in one take without rehearsal.
The Take Away Shows quickly gathered a large online following, The New York Times presented its impact as 'Vincent Moon reinvented the music video'. An entire new generation of young filmmakers around the world recognized the influence of the whole concept, this natural organic approach to music. A study from 2010 showed that more than 100 online film projects were directly inspired by La Blogothèque]'s Take Away Shows.
The large amount of clips is the result of a very fast filming process with mostly one take recordings in a way comparable to the Dogma 95 concept. Comparable with the field recordings of Alan Lomax or the Peel Sessions of John Peel, Moon has set up a large collection of unique single take recordings enhanced with artistic filmed video footage. The fast filming process he uses is a form of guerrilla film making. The sessions are usually two or three tracks filmed improvised in an unusual environment and as such they often had a rough and ready, demo-like feel, somewhere between a live performance and a finished music video. These live, unusually staged performances differ from the artifice of traditional music videos in favor of single-take, organic and primarily acoustic sessions.
Other Collaborations in Music business (2007-2010).
Following the success of the Blogotheque project, many artists, more established, asked Moon to work on longer films. Most of those projects became new explorations in relationship between music and sound, and a defiance towards pre-established formats of music films.
Michael Stipe became aware of the works of Moon and as a fan he asked him to make a film project for his band. In 2007 and 2008, Moon collaborated with Michael Stipe and R.E.M. on several video and web projects related to their album 'Accelerate.' The various experimental projects that came out of this collaboration include the 48min essay 6 DAYS, the experimental ninety-days-long web project called 90 NIGHTS, the video and the website for the single SUPERNATURAL SUPERSERIOUS, and the acclaimed THIS IS NOT A SHOW (co-directed by Jeremiah), a live movie on their Dublin performances in the summer of 2007.
The project ninetynights.com was a website dedicated to reveal little by little the new R.E.M. album, in the beginning of 2008. Over a period of 90 days, one shot would appear everyday on the website, at first very mysterious and without music, then little by little showing the band members and the songs. Each video was downloadable in high resolution, to let anybody make its own edit. Moon and Jeremiah's edit resulted in SIX DAYS, a semi-experimental approach of the music of REM. For the "Supernatural Superserious" project, Moon and Jeremiah shot a series of 12 clips published on a special website for free download as well as on YouTube. The music video was shot in various locations around New York City. On February 12, 2008 the website supernaturalsuperserious.com was launched, containing ten takes of the video available for download in high definition as well as a YouTube page for users to upload their own versions of the video. Afterwards Moon also directed the music video of the single "Until the Day Is Done".
Other projects at the time included a one hour film with Beirut in collaboration with La Blogotheque, CHEAP MAGIC INSIDE, a film about Beirut (band). All the 12 songs from the new album 'The Flying Club Cup' were filmed in the streets of Brooklyn, in a one-take experiment.
From 2005 to 2009, Vincent Moon recorded the ATP Music Festival, an independent rock festival from the UK. His images ended up in the film ALL TOMORROW'S PARTIES (2009, 90min), co-directed by Jonathan Caouette, and was released to critical acclaims. Vincent Moon's series of 7 experimental gonzo films from the same festival were released later under the name FROM ATP.
In November 2008, Vincent Moon traveled to Prague with longtime collaborators Antoine Viviani and Gaspar Claus to document the mythical Havlovi, a couple of musicians who dedicated their life to their instruments, the ancient viola da gamba. The result, LITTLE BLUE NOTHING (2009, 50min) has been screened in several cities around the world, and was released in 2014 on limited-series dvd.
In March 2009, cellist Gaspar Claus and Vincent Moon embarked on a journey to Japan to portray the cult poet, musician and painter Kazuki Tomokawa. The film LA FAUTE DES FLEURS, sometimes considered Moon's best work, has won the Sound & Vision Award at the documentary film festival CPH DOX 2009 in Denmark. A rare thing for Moon, as he never submits his work for competitions. 
In April 2009, he organized and recorded a concert of singer Lhasa de Sela in Montreal, to promote her new album. Unfortunately, this concert would be Lhasa's last one in Canada, as she passed away later that year. Those films have been released online since then.
Later that month, Moon has been working with the cult post rockers from Glasgow, Mogwai, around their live show in New York City. BURNING, a 50' live film from that performance, co-directed by Nathanael Le Scouarnec, represents a radical vision of live music, a unique attempt in documenting music on stage, and has been considered one of the best music films in history.
During the year 2009, Moon started to explore other approaches to music, leaving a little bit the Take Away Shows project to other filmmakers, and created his own blog Fiume Nights, where he started to write ideas about media, culture and creation in the 21st century, and continued to make short films.
His last project in the field of rock music would be AN ISLAND, recorded in august 2010 with danish band Efterklang on their native island of Als. Vincent Moon and Efterklang released the film exclusively online in January 2011, developing of a new method of film distribution called 'private-public screenings' - people who want to see the film have to organize their own screenings. The massive success of the operation (over 1100 home screenings to date) led to a new concept in online cinema.
In March 2011, Vincent Moon teamed up with the electronic folk duo Lulacruza to explore the musical cultures of urban and provincial Colombia. The resulting work, "Esperando El Tsunami", has been released in November 2011, using the distribution system of 'private-public screenings', first used in "An Island."
Collection Petites Planètes, exploring the world of sound (2009-2014).
On december 2008, Vincent Moon left Paris and most of his previous work behind to explore new horizons. He quitted La Blogothèque quite soon, even though he continued from time to time to contribute with some films, and decided to set up his new personal ‘nomadic’ label - Collection Petites Planètes.
Under this new project, he explored and recorded traditional music, religious rituals, relationships between music and trance over the five continents. These 'experimental ethnography' films mark a clear departure from his earlier line of work on alternative and indie music scenes - the films are more subtle, the camera more quiet, the form evolves towards some unique bridge between the work of Robert Gardner and the recordings of Alan Lomax.
Everywhere he went, he relied on local connections and never collaborated with standard production companies, instead working as much as possible with people who contacted him in the years of La Blogothèque.
Moon has been traveling in Chile, Argentina, Cambodia, Egypt, Poland, Iceland, Brazil, Colombia, Turkey, Sardinia, Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, the Philippines, Croatia, Ethiopia, Russia, Uruguay, Peru, the Caucasus, Vietnam and Laos for the Collection Petites Planètes since 2010. Always making films with and of the local people, and constantly sharing them under a Creative Commons licence on the internet.
Collection Petites Planètes is funded almost exclusively through donations on his website, and through the screenings and workshops given during his travels. Rejecting traditional professionalism in favor of twenty-first century amateurism, he collaborates with local creators and young talent all over the world. Vincent Moon is currently traveling the world, questioning the established norms of visual representations of the 'other'.
Into the sacred (2014 - ...).
At the turn of the year 2014, after 5 years traveling, Vincent Moon switched his way of living and working to explore deeper into one subject - the renewal of sacred in our generation. His first project is the feature-length film HIBRIDOS, set up in Brazil, and exploring the various cults in the country, from afro-brazilian beliefs to more recent syncretic aspects, weaving a very complex idea of where human and spirits stands amongst the fast pace of nowadays world.

Coppertone (sunscreen)

Coppertone is the brand name for an American sunscreen, owned by Merck, formerly Schering-Plough. Coppertone is the sister brand to Bain de Soleil, which is targeted to adult women. The name originated from its marketing of suntan lotion.
It dates to 1944, when pharmacist Benjamin Green invented a lotion to darken tans. The company became famous in 1953 when it introduced the Coppertone girl, an advertisement showing a young blond girl in pigtails staring in surprise as a Cocker Spaniel sneaks up behind her and pulls down her blue swimsuit bottom, revealing her buttocks to have a lighter tone than the rest of her body. Accompanying the ads was the impish slogan, "Don't be a paleface!"
The original Coppertone logo was the profile of an Indian chief. In 1953 Tally Embry Advertising in Florida was hired, and their ad men created the concept of the little girl and the pup. An artist named Joyce Ballantyne Brand re-drew the little girl in 1959 when the original artwork was destroyed in a fire. She was then working for Grant Advertising in New York. She purportedly used her daughter, Cheri, as her model, although her drawing closely resembled the original artwork A series of mechanical billboards was constructed across the United States, whereon the motorized dog and swimsuit bottoms rocked up and down perpetually. Though most of them are long since gone or have stopped moving, one such billboard of the then Coppertone Girl still stands in Miami Beach — dog, pigtails, swimsuit, and all. Sometime around 1965, Jodie Foster made her acting debut as the Coppertone girl in a television commercial, when she was three years old.
In 1993, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the sunscreen, a contest was held on the sandy beach of Disney's Polynesian Hotel in Orlando Florida to find "The Coppertone Girl", since Cheri Brand had grown up by then. The contest was hosted by Regis Philbin along with Cheri as one of the judges. The winner was picked based on the contestant's maturity, congeniality, eloquence, confidence, and how well she resembled the cartoon. The winner was four-year-old Alexis Durgee. She was chosen out of over 100,000 models and twenty remaining finalists. Afterwards she appeared on Sally Jessy Raphael Show with Cheri Brand and Dalton Orband, the winning Coppertone Boy. Alexis went on to model for Coppertone and Water Babies advertisements through the following year and was shot in several Coppertone commercials.
At the turn of the 21st century, Coppertone revised drawings of the Coppertone Girl so that they would be less revealing and no tan lines. Some recent versions show only the girl's lower back, as opposed to her buttocks, or wearing a T-shirt, a hat, and holding a bottle of Coppertone while the puppy is shown pulling on her shirt.

Meister Eckhart

Eckhart von Hochheim O.P. (c. 1260 – c. 1327), commonly known as Meister Eckhart [], was a German theologian, philosopher and mystic, born near Gotha, in the Landgraviate of Thuringia in the Holy Roman Empire.
Eckhart came into prominence during the Avignon Papacy, at a time of increased tensions between the Franciscan Order and Eckhart's Dominican Order of Preachers. In later life he was accused of heresy and brought up before the local Franciscan-led Inquisition, and tried as a heretic by Pope John XXII. He probably died before his verdict was received.
He was well known for his work with pious lay groups such as the Friends of God and succeeded by his more circumspect disciples of John Tauler and Henry Suso. Since the 19th century, he has received renewed attention. Within popular spirituality he has acquired a status as a great mystic, though contemporary scholarship places him properly within the mediaeval scholastic and philosophical tradition.
Biography.
Youth.
Eckhart was probably born in the village of Tambach, near Gotha, in the Landgraviate of Thuringia, approximately 1260. It used to be asserted that he was born to a noble family of landowners, but this originated in a misinterpretation of the archives of the period. In reality, little is known about his family and early life. There is no authority for giving him the Christian name of Johannes which sometimes appears in biographical sketches: his Christian name was Eckhart; his surname was von Hochheim.
Church career.
Eckhart joined the Dominicans at Erfurt, probably when he was about eighteen and it is assumed he studied at Cologne. He may have also studied at the University of Paris, either before or after his time in Cologne.
The first solid evidence we have for his life is when on 18 April 1294, as a "baccalaureus" (lecturer) on the "Sentences" of Peter Lombard, a post to which he had presumably been appointed in 1293, he preached the Easter Sermon (the "Sermo Paschalis") at the Dominican convent of St. Jacques in Paris. In late 1294, Eckhart was made Prior at Erfurt and Provincial of Thuringia. His earliest vernacular work, "Reden der Unterweisung" ("The Talks of Instructions"/"Counsels on Discernment"), a series of talks delivered to Dominican novices, dates from this time (c1295-1298). In 1302, he was sent to Paris to take up the external Dominican chair of theology. He remained there till 1303. The short "Parisian Questions" date from this time.
In late 1303 Eckhart returned to Erfurt, and was made Provincial for Saxony, a province which reached at that time from the Netherlands to Livonia. He therefore had responsibility for forty-seven convents in this region. Complaints made against him and the provincial of Teutonia at the general chapter held in Paris in 1306, concerning irregularities among the ternaries, must have been trivial, because the general, Aymeric of Piacenza, appointed him in the following year his vicar-general for Bohemia with full power to set the demoralized monasteries there in order. Eckhart was Provincial for Saxony until 1311, during which time he founded three convents for women there.
On 14 May 1311 Eckhart was appointed by the general chapter held at Naples as teacher at Paris. To be invited back to Paris for a second stint as "magister" was a rare privilege - previously granted only to Thomas Aquinas. Eckhart stayed in Paris for two academic years, until the summer of 1313, living in the same house as William of Paris.
Then follows a long period of which it is known only that he spent part of the time at Strasbourg. It is unclear what specific office he held there: he seems chiefly to have been concerned with spiritual direction and with preaching in convents of Dominicans.
A passage in a chronicle of the year 1320, extant in manuscript (cf. Wilhelm Preger, i. 352–399), speaks of a prior Eckhart at Frankfurt who was suspected of heresy, and some have referred this to Meister Eckhart. It is unusual that a man under suspicion of heresy would have been appointed teacher in one of the most famous schools of the order, but Eckhart's distinctive expository style could well have already been under scrutiny by his Franciscan detractors.
Accusation of heresy.
In late 1323 or early 1324 Eckhart left Strasbourg for the Dominican house at Cologne. It is not clear exactly what he did here, though part of his time may have been spent teaching at the prestigious "Studium" in the city. Eckhart also continued to preach, addressing his sermons during a time of disarray among the clergy and monastic orders, rapid growth of numerous pious lay groups, and the Inquisition's continuing concerns over "heretical" movements throughout Europe.
It appears that some of the Dominican authorities already had concerns about Eckhart's teaching. The Dominican General Chapter held in Venice in the spring of 1325 had spoken out against "friars in Teutonia who say things in their sermons that can easily lead simple and uneducated people into error". This concern (or perhaps concerns held by the archbishop of Cologne, Henry of Virneburg) may have been why Nicholas of Strasburg, to whom the pope had in 1325 given the temporary charge of the Dominican monasteries in Germany, conducted an investigation of Eckhart's orthodoxy. Nicholas presented a list of suspect passages from the "Book of Consolation" to Eckhart, who responded sometime between August 1325 and January 1326 with a lost treatise "Requisitus", which satisfied his immediate superiors of his orthodoxy. Despite this assurance, however, the archbishop in 1326 ordered an inquisitorial process. At this point he issued a "Vindicatory Document", providing chapter and verse of what he had been taught.
Throughout the difficult months of late 1326 Eckhart had the full support of the local Dominican authorities, as evident in Nicholas of Strasbourg's three official protests against the actions of the inquisitors in January 1327. On 13 February 1327, before the archbishop's inquisitors pronounced their sentence on Eckhart, Eckhart preached a sermon in the Dominican church at Cologne, and then had his secretary read out a public protestation of his innocence. He stated in his protest that he had always detested everything wrong, and should anything of the kind be found in his writings, he now retracts. Eckhart himself translated the text into German, so that his audience, the vernacular public, could understand it. The verdict then seems to have gone against Eckhart. Eckhart denied competence and authority to the inquisitors and the archbishop, and appealed to the Pope against the verdict. He then in the spring of 1327 set off for Avignon.
In Avignon, Pope John XXII seems to have set up a two tribunals to inquire into the case, one of theologians and the other of cardinals. Evidence of this process is thin. However, it is known that the commissions reduced the 150 suspect articles down to 28; the document known as the "Votum Avenionense" gives, in scholastic fashion, the twenty-eight articles, Eckhart's defence of each, and the rebuttal of the commissioners. On 30 April 1328, the pope wrote to Bishop Henry of Virneburg that the case against Eckhart was moving ahead, but added that Eckhart had already died (modern scholarship suggests he may have died on 28 January 1328). The papal commission eventually confirmed (albeit in modified form) the decision of the Cologne commission against Eckhart.
Pope John XXII issued a bull ("In agro dominico"), 27 March 1329, in which a series of statements from Eckhart is characterized as heretical; another as suspected of heresy. At the close, it is stated that Eckhart recanted before his death everything which he had falsely taught, by subjecting himself and his writing to the decision of the Apostolic See. It is possible that the Pope's unusual decision to issue the bull, despite the death of Eckhart (and the fact that Eckhart was not being personally condemned as a heretic), was due to the pope's fear of the growing problem of mystical heresy, and pressure from his ally Henry II to bring the case to a definite conclusion.
Influence.
Eckhart was one of the most influential 13th-century Christian Neoplatonists in his day, and remained widely read in the later Middle Ages. However, his trial (he was the only medieval theologian tried before the Inquisition as a heretic) and subsequent (1329) condemnation of excerpts from his works cast a shadow over his reputation for later readers.
The lay group, Friends of God, followers of Eckhart, existed in communities across the region and carried on his ideas under the leadership of such priests as John Tauler and Henry Suso.
The belief of some early twentieth-century writers that Eckhart's work was forgotten soon after his death by his fellow Dominicans was proved mistaken by the 1960 discovery of a manuscript containing around six hundred excerpts from Eckhart, and clearly deriving from an original made in the Cologne Dominican convent after the promulgation of the bull condemning Eckhart's writings, "In agro dominico" (since notations from the bull are inserted into the manuscript). This manuscript had come into the possession of the Carthusians in Basel - demonstrating that at least some Dominicans and Carthusians had continued to read Eckhart's work.
It is also clear that Nicholas of Cusa, Archbishop of Cologne in the 1430s and 1440s, engaged in extensive study of Eckhart. He assembled a collection of Eckhart's Latin works (a collection which still survives). Notes in the manuscripts show the careful study he spent on it.
Johannes Tauler and Rulman Merswin.
Eckhart is considered by some to have been the inspirational "layman" referred to in Johannes Tauler's and Rulman Merswin's later writings in Strasbourg where he is known to have spent time (although it is doubtful that he authored the simplistic "Book of the Nine Rocks" published by Merswin and attributed to the layman knight from the north). On the other hand most scholars consider the "layman" to be a pure fiction invented by Rulman Merswin to hide his authorship because of the intimidating tactics of the Inquisition at the time.
"Theologia Germanica" and the Reformation.
It has been suspected that his practical communication of the mystical path is behind the influential 14th-century "anonymous" "Theologia Germanica" which was disseminated after his disappearance. According to the medieval introduction of the document, its author was an unnamed member of the Teutonic Order of Knights living in Frankfurt.
The lack of imprimatur from the Church and anonymity of the author of the "Theologia germanica" did not lessen its influence for the next two centuries — including Martin Luther at the peak of public and clerical resistance to Catholic indulgences — and was viewed by some historians of the early 20th century as pivotal in provoking Luther's actions and the subsequent Protestant Reformation.
The following quote from the "Theologia Germanica" depicts the conflict between worldly and ecclesiastical affairs:
Obscurity.
Eckhart was largely forgotten from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, barring occasional interest from thinkers such as Angelus Silesius (1627-1677). For centuries none of Eckhart's writings were known except a number of sermons, found in the old editions of Johann Tauler's sermons, published by Kachelouen (Leipzig, 1498) and by Adam Petri (Basel, 1521 and 1522).
Rediscovery.
Interest in Eckhart’s works was revived in the early nineteenth century, especially by German Romantics and Idealist philosophers. Franz von Baader, for instance, studied Eckhart in the early 19th century. Franz Pfeiffer's publication in 1857 of Eckhart's German sermons and treatises added greatly to this interest. A second important figure in the later nineteenth-century for the recovery of Eckhart's works was Heinrich Seuse Denifle, who was the first to recover Eckhart's Latin works, from 1886 onwards.
During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, much Catholic interest in Eckhart was concerned with the consistency of his thought in relation to Neoscholastic thought – in others words, to see whether Eckhart's thought could be seen to be essentially in conformity with orthodoxy as represented by his fellow Dominican Thomas Aquinas.
An ongoing question since the mid nineteenth century has been which works attributed to Eckhart should be considered genuine - and, in particular, whether greater weight should be given to the vernacular works or Latin works. Unlike the vernacular works, today known in over 200 manuscripts, the Latin writings are found in only a handful of manuscripts, but Denifle argued, and has since been followed by many others, that these Latin treatises which Eckhart carefully prepared for publication were essential to a full understanding of Eckhart. In the early twentieth century, an important event was the publication of the "Defense" (also known as the "Rechtsfertigung", or "Vindicatory Document"), the record of Eckhart's responses to two of the series of propositions brought against him at Cologne. This survives in a single manuscript, and was first published in 1923. It was important not just for providing extra details of the circumstances of Eckhart's trial, but also because extracts from sermons and treatises mentioned in the document and accepted by Eckhart as his own provided sound external criteria for the authenticity of a number of the vernacular works. Today, there remains some dispute about the authenticity of various vernacular works. There is, however, no dispute about the genuine character of the Latin works presented in the critical edition.
Works.
The publication of the modern critical edition of Eckhart's German and Latin works began in 1936, and is nearly complete.
Latin works.
One difficulty with Eckhart's Latin writings is that they clearly represent only a small portion of what he planned to write. Eckhart describes his plans to write a vast "Opus Tripartitum" ("Three-Part Work"). Unfortunately, all that exists today of the first Part, the "Work of Propositions", is the Prologue illustrating the first proposition (with Eckhart intending the first part alone to consist of over one thousand propositions). The second Part, called the "Work of Questions", no longer exists. The third Part, the "Work of Commentaries", is the major surviving Latin work by Eckhart, consisting of a Prologue, six commentaries, and fifty-six sermons. It used to be thought that this work was begun while Eckhart was in Paris between 1311 and 1313; however, recent manuscript discoveries mean that much of what survives must be dated to before 1310.
The surviving Latin works are therefore:
Vernacular works.
Questions concerning the authenticity of the Middle High German texts attributed to Eckhart are much greater than for the Latin texts. The problems involve not only whether a particular sermon or treatise is to be judged authentic or pseudonymous, but also, given the large number of manuscripts and the fragmentary condition of many of them, whether it is even possible to establish the text for some of the pieces accepted as genuine. Eckhart's sermons are versions written down by others from memory or from notes, meaning that the possibility for error was much greater than for the carefully written Latin treatises.
The critical edition of Eckhart's works accepts 86 sermons as genuine. Of these, "Sermons" 1-16b are proved authentic by direct citation in the "Defense". "Sermons" 17-24 have such close textual affinities with Latin sermons recognised as genuine that they are accepted. "Sermons" 25-86 are harder to verify, and judgements have been made on the basis of style and content.
When Franz Pfeiffer published his edition of Eckhart's works in 1857, he included seventeen vernacular treatises he considered to be written by Eckhart. Modern scholarship is much more cautious, however, and the critical edition accepts only four of Eckhart's vernacular treatises as genuine:
Teachings.
Writings.
Eckhart wrote on metaphysics and spiritual psychology, drawing extensively on mythic imagery, and was notable for his sermons communicating the metaphorical content of the gospels to laymen and clergy alike. His work has influenced major German philosophers.
As Eckhart said in his trial defence, his sermons were meant to inspire in listeners the desire above all to do some good. In this, he frequently used unusual language or seemed to stray from the path of orthodoxy, which made him suspect to the Church during the tension-filled years of the Avignon Papacy.
Sermons.
Although he was an accomplished academic theologian, Eckhart's best-remembered works are his highly unusual sermons in the vernacular. Eckhart as a preaching friar attempted to guide his flock, as well as monks and nuns under his jurisdiction with practical sermons on spiritual/psychological transformation and New Testament metaphorical content related to the creative power inherent in disinterest (dispassion or detachment).
The central theme of Eckhart's German sermons is the presence of God in the individual soul, and the dignity of the soul of the just man. Although he elaborated on this theme, he rarely departed from it. In one sermon, Eckhart gives the following summary of his message:
Theology.
Novel concepts Eckhart introduced into Christian metaphysics clearly deviate from the common scholastic canon.
Abundance of Being.
In Eckhart's vision, God is primarily fecund. Out of overabundance of love the fertile God gives birth to the Son, the Word in all of us. Clearly, this is rooted in the Neoplatonic notion of "ebullience; boiling over" of the One that cannot hold back its abundance of Being. Eckhart had imagined the creation not as a "compulsory" overflowing (a metaphor based on a common hydrodynamic picture), but as the free act of will of the triune nature of Deity (refer Trinitarianism).
Gott und Gottheit.
Another bold assertion is Eckhart's distinction between God and Godhead ("Gottheit" in German, meaning Godhood or Godness, state of being God). These notions had been present in Pseudo-Dionysius's writings and John the Scot's "De divisione naturae", but Eckhart, with characteristic vigor and audacity, reshaped the germinal metaphors into profound images of polarity between the Unmanifest and Manifest Absolute.
Modern popularisation.
Theology.
Matthew Fox.
Matthew Fox (born 1940) is an American theologian. Formerly a priest and a member of the Dominican Order within the Roman Catholic Church, Fox was an early and influential exponent of a movement that came to be known as Creation Spirituality. The movement draws inspiration from the wisdom traditions of Christian scriptures, and the philosophies of such medieval Catholic visionaries as Hildegard of Bingen, Thomas Aquinas, Saint Francis of Assisi, Julian of Norwich, Dante Alighieri, Meister Eckhart and Nicholas of Cusa, and others. Fox has written a number of articles on Eckhart, and a book titled "Breakthrough: Meister Eckhart's Creation Spirituality in New Translation.".
Modern philosophy.
The postmodern French theorist and philosopher Jacques Derrida uses Eckhart's Negative Theology to describe his own concept of différance.
Modern spirituality.
Meister Eckhart has become one of the timeless heroes of modern spirituality, which thrives on an all-inclusive syncretism. This syncretism started with the colonisation of Asia, and the search of similarities between eastern and western religions. Western monotheism was projected onto eastern religiosity by western orientalists, trying to accommodate eastern religiosity to a western understanding, whereafter Asian intellectuals used these projections as a starting point to propose the superiority of those eastern religions. Early on, the figure of Meister Eckhart has played a role in these developements and exchanges.
Renewed academic attention to Eckhart has attracted favorable attention to his work from contemporary non-Christian mystics. Eckhart's most famous single quote, "The Eye with which I see God is the same Eye with which God sees me", is commonly cited by thinkers within neopaganism and ultimatist Buddhism as a point of contact between these traditions and Christian mysticism. The popular writer Eckhart Tolle changed his name in acknowledgement of Eckhart's influence on his philosophy.
Schopenhauer.
The first translation of Upanishads appeared in two parts in 1801 and 1802. The 19th-century philosopher Schopenhauer was influenced by the early translations of the Upanishads, which he called "the consolation of my life". Schopenhauer compared Eckhart's views to the teachings of Indian, Christian and Islamic mystics and ascetics:
Schopenhauer also stated:
Theosophical Society.
A major force in the mutual influence of eastern and western ideas and religiosity was the Theosophical Society., which also incorporated Eckhart in its notion of Theosophy. It searched for ancient wisdom in the east, spreading eastern religious ideas in the west. One of its salient features was the belief in "Masters of Wisdom", "beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others". The Theosophical Society also spread western ideas in the east, aiding a modernisation of eastern traditions, and contributing to a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.
Neo-Vedanta.
The Theosophical Society had a major influence on Hindu reform movements. A major proponent of this "neo-Hinduism", also called "neo-Vedanta", was Vivekananda who popularised his modernised interpretation of Advaita Vedanta in the 19th and early 20th century in both India and the west, emphasising "anubhava" ("personal experience") over scriptural authority. Vivekanda's teachings have been compared to Eckhart's teachings.
In the 20th century, Eckhart's thoughts were also compared to Shankara's Advaita Vedanta by Rudolf Otto in his "Mysticism East and West". According to King, the aim of this work was to redeem Eckhart's mysticism in Protestant circles, attempting "to establish the superiority of the German mysticism of Eckhart over the Indian mysticism of Sankara".
Buddhist Modernism.
The Theosophical Society also had a major influence on Buddhist modernism, and the spread of this modernised Buddhism in the west. Along with H. S. Olcott and Anagarika Dharmapala, Helena P. Blavatsky was instrumental in the Western transmission and revival of Theravada Buddhism.
In 1891, Karl Eugen Neumann, who translated large parts of the Tripitaka, found parallels between Eckhart and Buddhism, which he published in "Zwei buddhistische Suttas und ein Traktat Meister Eckharts" ("Two Buddhist Suttas and a treatise of Meister Eckhart"). D.T. Suzuki, who joined the Theosophical Society Adyar and was an active Theosophist, discerned parallels between Eckhart's teachings and Zen Buddhism in his "Mysticism:Christian and Buddhist", drawing similarities between Eckhart's "pure nothingness" ("ein bloss niht") and sunyata. Shizuteru Ueda, a third generation Kyoto School philosopher and scholar in medieval philosophy showed similarities between Eckhart's soteriology and Zen Buddhism in an article.
Reiner Schurmann, a Professor of Philosophy, while agreeing with Daisetz T. Suzuki that there exist certain similarities between Zen Buddhism and Meister Eckhart's teaching, also disputed Suzuki's contention that the ideas expounded in Eckhart's sermons closely approach Buddhist thought, "so closely indeed, that one could stamp them almost definitely as coming out of Buddhist speculations". Schurmann's several clarifications included:
Psycho-analysis.
The notable humanistic psychoanalyst and philosopher Erich Fromm was another scholar who brought renewed attention in the west to Eckhart's writings, drawing upon many of the latters themes in his large corpus of work. Eckhart was a significant influence in developing United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld's conception of spiritual growth through selfless service to humanity, as detailed in his book of contemplations called Vägmärken ('Markings').
In popular culture.
Rubin's "Jacob's Ladder".
In "Jacob's Ladder", Louis, the main character's friend, attributes the following quote to Eckhart:
Davidson's "The Gargoyle".
In the book "The Gargoyle" by Andrew Davidson, Eckhart is mentioned in a story Marianne Engel recounts to the (unnamed) protagonist about her days in the Engelthal Monastery:
Salinger's "Franny and Zooey".
Eckhart is also referenced in J. D. Salinger's "Franny and Zooey". In a letter to Zooey, Buddy says, 
Adams's "Harmonielehre".
The third movement of John Adams's Harmonielehre symphony (1985) is titled 'Meister Eckhart and Quackie', which imagines the mystic floating through space with the composer's daughter Emily (nicknamed Quackie) on his back whispering secrets of grace in his ear.
Eckhart as a mystic.
Since the 1960s debate has been going on in Germany whether Eckhart should be called a "mystic". The philosopher Karl Albert had already argued that Eckhart had to be placed in the tradition of philosophical mysticism of Parmenides, Plato, Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus and other neo-Platonistic thinkers. Heribert Fischer argued in the 1960s that Eckhart was a mediaeval theologian.
Kurt Flasch, a member of the so-called Bochum-school of mediaeval philosophy, strongly reacted against the influence of New Age mysticism and "all kinds of emotional subjective mysticism", arguing for the need to free Eckhart from "the Mystical Flood". He sees Eckhart strictly as a philosopher. Flasch argues that the opposition between "mystic" and "scholastic" is not relevant because this mysticism (in Eckhart's context) is penetrated by the spirit of the University, in which it occurred.
According to Hackett, Eckhart is to be understood as an "original hermeneutical thinker in the Latin tradition". To understand Eckhart, he has to be properly placed within the western philosophical tradition of which he was a part. 
Rehabilitation.
Eckhart's status in the contemporary Catholic Church has been uncertain. The Dominican Order pressed in the last decade of the 20th century for his full rehabilitation and confirmation of his theological orthodoxy. Pope John Paul II voiced favorable opinion on this initiative, even going as far as quoting from Eckhart's writings, but the affair is still confined to the corridors of the Vatican. In the spring of 2010, it was revealed that there was finally a response from the Vatican in a letter dated 1992. Timothy Radcliffe, then Master of the Dominicans and recipient of the letter, summarized the contents as follows:
Professor Winfried Trusen of Würzburg, a correspondent of Radcliffe, wrote in part of a defence of Eckhart to Cardinal Ratzinger, stating

BL 6 inch Mk XI naval gun

The BL 6 inch Gun Mark XI was a British 50 calibres high-velocity naval gun which was mounted as primary armament on cruisers and secondary armament on pre-dreadnought battleships.
History.
The gun with its increased length of 50 calibres gave improved firepower over the current 6-inch Mk VII gun of 45 calibres. However, its increased length and weight made it unwieldy in the current manually operated shipboard mountings on light cruisers, which did not provide a steady platform. Britain reverted to 45-calibres guns in new warships from 1914 onwards with the BL 6 inch Mk XII gun.
Naval gun.
Guns were mounted in the following ships :
Coast defence gun.
The Mk XI gun was emplaced for coast defence in South Africa and particularly in Australia leading up to World War II, and remained in service until the 1950s. Guns in Australia came from the decommissioned World War I cruisers HMAS "Sydney", HMAS "Melbourne" and HMAS "Brisbane" and were emplaced in northern Australia and Torres Strait to defend against possible attack by Japan, and on Rottnest Island WA, Brisbane and the Sydney harbour and Port Kembla defences.

496th Tactical Fighter Squadron

The 496th Tactical Fighter Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit, last assigned to the United States Air Forces in Europe, 50th Tactical Fighter Wing, being stationed at Hahn AB, Germany. The squadron was inactivated on 15 May 1991.
History.
During World War II, the squadron served as an operational training and a replacement training unit. Also participated occasionally in demonstrations and maneuvers 1942–1944.
Activated in the Reserve in 1949 to train as a fighter corollary of the 52d Fighter Wing, All Weather in the regular Air Force, but apparently undermanned and thus performed very little training. During its only 2-week summer encampment (12–26 June 1950), the squadron had only four pilots capable of flying the F-82 Twin Mustangs it was assigned to provide training, and the 52d Wing made little use of its corollary unit. The squadron was ordered to active service on 1 June 1951, inactivated the next day, and its few people became "fillers" in other USAF units.
Activated briefly at Hamilton AFB, California in early 1953, equipped with F-86F Sabres, performed air defense of the West Coast of the United States. Re-assigned to the United States Air Forces in Europe, assigned to the 86th Fighter-Bomber Wing at Landstuhl Air Base, West Germany in 1954. Mission in USAFE was air defense of West Germany, flying F-86D Sabre Interceptors.
Moved to Hahn Air Base in November 1956, remaining assigned to the 86th FIW. Operated from Hahn for the next decade, being re-equipped with the F-102A Delta Dagger in 1959, being assigned to the 86th Air Division (Defense). 
Reassigned to the host 50th TFW at Hahn in 1968 as part of the withdrawal of the F-102 from Europe, being re-equipped with F-4E Phantom IIs and becoming a tactical Fighter Squadron. Continued routine training operations throughout the 1970s, upgrading to F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft in 1979.
Inactivated in 1991 with the host 50th Tactical Fighter Wing at Hahn and part of the closure of the base and the end of the Cold War.

Millennium Star Atlas

The Millennium Star Atlas was constructed as a collaboration between 
a team at Sky & Telescope led by Roger Sinnott, and the European Space Agency's 
Hipparcos project, led by Michael Perryman. It was the first sky atlas to include the
Hipparcos and Tycho Catalogue data, extending earlier undertakings
in terms of completeness and uniformity to a magnitude limit of around
10–11 magnitude. It appeared as a stand-alone
publication, and as three volumes of the 17-volume Hipparcos Catalogue.
The 1548 charts include one million stars from the
Hipparcos and Tycho-1 Catalogues, three times as many as in any
previous all-sky atlas; more than 8000 galaxies with their
orientation; outlines of many bright and dark nebulae; the location of
many open and globular clusters; and some 250 of the brightest quasars. 
The non-stellar objects in the atlas are identified by type and designation. The chart scale
is 100 arcsec/mm, matching that at the focus of an 8-inch
f/10 Schmidt-Cassegrain. Star magnitudes are essentially Johnson V.
Distance labels are given for stars within 200 light-years of the Sun.
Proper motion arrows are given for stars with motions exceeding
0.2 arcsec/yr. Variable stars are indicated by amplitude and
variability type. Many thousands of already known and newly discovered
double stars are depicted with tick marks indicating separation and
position angle.
Other major celestial atlases since 1997 have also incorporated the Hipparcos
and Tycho Catalogue data. These include Sky Atlas 2000.0 (2nd edition to 
8.5 mag), the Cambridge Star Atlas (3rd edition to 6.5 mag), Uranometria 2000.0 (2nd edition to 9.7 mag),
the Bright Star Atlas 2000.0 (to 6.5 mag), and the Pocket Sky Atlas (to 7.6 mag).

The Shelter (The Twilight Zone)

"The Shelter" is an episode of the American television anthology series "The Twilight Zone".
Plot.
It is a typical evening in a typical suburban community. At the residence of physician Bill Stockton, he enjoys a birthday party being thrown for him by his wife Grace and their son Paul. Also at the party are Jerry Harlowe, Bill's brother-in-law; Frank Henderson and Marty Weiss, Bill and Jerry's former roommates; and the wives and children of Jerry, Frank, and Marty. Bill is well-known and liked by this gathering; he attended the State University with Marty, Frank, and Jerry. Moreover, Bill has repeatedly administered to the health and well being of each one of said guests and/or delivered their children. Everyone is especially friendly and jovial, even when mention is made of Bill's late-night work on a fallout shelter which he has built in his basement. Suddenly, a Civil Defense (CONELRAD) announcement overheard by young Paul, is made that unidentified objects have been detected heading for the United States. In these times, everybody knows what that means: nuclear attack.
As panic ensues, the doctor locks himself and his family into his shelter. The same gathering of friends becomes hysterical and now wants to occupy the shelter. All of the previous cordiality is now replaced with soaring desperation; pent-up hostility, searing racism, and other suppressed emotions boil to the surface. Stockton offers his basement to the guests, but the shelter itself has sufficient air, provisions, and space for only three people (the Stocktons themselves). The once-friendly neighbors don't accept this; they break down the shelter door with an improvised battering ram. Just then, a final Civil Defense broadcast announces that the objects have been identified as harmless satellites and that no danger is present. The neighbors apologize for their behavior; yet Stockton wonders if they have destroyed each other without a bomb.
Context.
The episode aired after a summer in which the fallout shelter had loomed large in national discourse, due to the Berlin Crisis of 1961. Meeting with U.S. President John F. Kennedy in Vienna, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev insisted - not for the first time - that NATO troops withdraw from Berlin, handing over the city to an independent, Soviet-aligned East Germany. Khrushchev explicitly threatened thermonuclear war if the United States refused to relent. Kennedy responded publicly seven weeks later in a televised address on July 25, 1961. During the speech, Kennedy stated his intention to ensure access to shelters in the event of a nuclear attack on the United States. In the aftermath of the speech, numerous companies began producing such shelters, and products were sold with explicit reference to the shelters; for instance, Foam-Ettes toothpaste tablets boasted that they could be used "wherever you are - even in a family fallout shelter." Rod Serling saw an opportunity for urgent social commentary and "rushed into production" an episode that would comment on prevailing anxieties. Two weeks after the episode aired, the crisis escalated and construction of the Berlin Wall began.

Amerigroup

Amerigroup, a wholly owned subsidiary of WellPoint, Inc., is an American managed care company serving approximately 2.7 million members in 12 states nationwide including Kansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. Together with WellPoint's affiliated health plans, Amerigroup serves approximately 4.5 million beneficiaries of state-sponsored health plans in 19 states targeting people eligible for Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), FamilyCare and other government plans.
History.
Amerigroup began as AMERICAID Community Care in 1994 and was initially aimed at the health care problems of children, mothers and pregnant women enrolled in Medicaid. Amerigroup became a publicly traded corporation in the fall of 2001. In 2006, Amerigroup entered the Medicare Advantage program, serving low-income people who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid through special needs plans. In 2007, Amerigroup began the operation of traditional Medicare Advantage plans. Currently, Amerigroup offers health care services through three government programs that target different segments of the country’s low-income population: Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Medicare. On July 9, 2012, Wellpoint entered into an agreement to acquire Amerigroup Corporation for $4.9 billion.
Health Care Products.
As of Dec. 31, 2012:
Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) 
Seniors and People with Disabilities (S/PD) 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
FamilyCare
Medicare Advantage
National Advisory Board.
In 2007, Amerigroup developed the National Advisory Board (NAB) to focus on meeting the needs of seniors and people with disabilities, who are a significant proportion of its clients. The NAB provides policy recommendations for improving programs and services for seniors and people with disabilities. Convened by Lex Frieden, who was instrumental in conceiving and drafting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the NAB is made up of 19 community advocates, health care experts and academics. The NAB advocated that the modernized health care infrastructure be required to meet the needs of people with disabilities and seniors.
Corporate Social Responsibility.
Amerigroup Foundation.
The main goals of the Amerigroup Foundation are to foster access to care, encourage safe and healthy children and families, and promote community improvement and healthy neighborhoods. In the past year, the Foundation contributed more than $3 million to various community organizations across the United States. Since inception, the Foundation has awarded $17.3 million to community health centers, service organizations, and local programs.
Volunteerism.
Amerigroup has a Community Volunteers program, created to recognize and support the contributions employees make in communities across the country and to inspire others to volunteer. All Amerigroup employees receive a paid day off each year to do volunteer work in their communities.
Medicaid Fraud.
Fired Executive Cleveland Tyson provided federal prosecutors with evidence that Amerigroup was systematically declining services to low-income pregnant women in Illinois from 2001 to 2003. Their contract with the state required that they enroll all eligible clients, but prosecutors submitted emails showing that Amerigroup had a policy of targeting healthy enrollees and specifically excluded pregnant women and others with expensive conditions. In October 2006, a federal jury found Amerigroup liable for $48 million in damages, which was tripled by statue to $144 million. In March 2007, an additional fine of over $190 million was levied for 18,000 false claims. After appealing the judgments, Amerigroup agreed in July 2008 to settle the charges for $225 million. As a whistleblower, qui tam provisions entitled Tyson to $56 million of the settlement.

List of Soul characters

A comprehensive list of characters from the "Soul" series of fighting games produced by Namco.
Overall conception and development.
The "Soul" series is a weapon-based fighting game franchise developed by Namco Bandai's Project Soul division and consists of eight games: "Soul Edge", "Soulcalibur", "Soulcalibur II", "Soulcalibur III", "Soulcalibur Legends", "Soulcalibur IV", "" and "Soulcalibur V". Set in the 16th century, the plot of the games revolve around Soul Edge, a cursed sword able to possess its wielder and devour souls, and Soul Calibur, a holy sword and Soul Edge's antithesis.
Characters.
With each character, their weapon was decided upon before other aspects were. The design was then built to revolve around it, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. Once established, appearance and movement were fleshed out by the team's concept artist and rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on the character. The completed model was then animated by a motion capture artist working directly with the team. During this phase the team additionally worked with the story creators, refining the character's own role in the plot as needed throughout development. In the course of the series, two characters have been an exception to the process: Johan Druer, a berserker exclusive to the "Soulcalibur" Japanese player's guide, and Necrid, a character co-produced with Todd McFarlane that appears in "Soulcalibur II".
Starting with "Soulcalibur II", guest characters from other franchises or companies were introduced for different home ports of the game, with "The Legend of Zelda"s Link appearing for the GameCube version, comic book character Spawn for the Xbox, and "Tekken"s Heihachi Mishima for the PlayStation 2. Despite rumors of "Devil May Cry"s Dante's inclusion in "Soulcalibur III", developers confirmed no plans for the inclusion of guest characters for the title, with series producer Hiroaki Yotoriyama stating "It’s my policy to never do the same thing twice." However, under new producer Katsutoshi Sasaki the concept was revisited in later titles in the series, with "Tales of Symphonia"s Lloyd Irving appearing in "Soulcalibur Legends", "Star Wars" characters The Apprentice, Yoda and Darth Vader appearing in "Soulcalibur IV", with the latter two exclusively to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions respectively until later released as downloadable content, "God of War"s Kratos for "Soulcalibur: Broken Destiny"., and Ezio Auditore da Firenze from The Assassins Creed series for "Soulcalibur V". Devil Jin from Tekken was also added to Soulcalibur V, However, he was a non-playable character and you could only access his moveset by creating a character that uses his style of fighting.
Featured characters.
This table contains all the main characters in the series, with the bonus and guest characters listed below it.
Introduced in "Soul Edge".
Hwang.
, a man with a strong sense of justice, joined Korea's coast guard and was sent to find the "Sword of Salvation", really the cursed sword Soul Edge, in order to protect his country. However he returned after learning of an impending Japanese invasion of his homeland, bringing his friend's daughter, Seong Mi-na, back with him. After he set out after her again, he discovered the true nature of the sword, and informed his superiors of it. They dismissed him as a result, but upon learning that the Japanese were also after the sword he was instead sent to stop them. Heading westward, he plans to join forces with Mi-na to destroy the blade. In "Soulcalibur IV", he was in Ostrheinsburg when he crossed paths with Hong Yun-seong, a student of the Seong dojo. Hwang tried to warn him the danger of Soul Edge, though the young warrior did not heed his warning and continued his journey to find the sword. After the Soul Edge is destroyed, he is deemed a national hero and begins training the new generation alongside Mi-na and Yun-seong.
During development several weapons were considered, including a zhanmadao like Seong Mi-na's and a bladed nunchaku like Li Long's. Several different outfit components were also considered at this time, such as the inclusion of head and/or arm guards and an arm bandana With Hwang's appearance in "Soulcalibur" his attire was changed. Chinese style costumes were considered, including an outfit with an open jacket and a bandaged design with a Chinese martial artist's attire. The developers based his look around the concept of a traveler, implementing subtle hints such as his torn pant legs.
Mitsurugi.
He has also appeared in "Namco × Capcom" as a playable character.
Rock.
His father managed to bid Soul Edge at one auction and was about to take it home, only for the ship to be attacked by pirate Cervantes who killed everyone except Rock, who washed up in the shores of America with his memories gone. The Native Americans were unwilling to help Rock due to his size and only a boy named Bangoo who was unafraid to befriend him. Rock eventually recovered his memories over time and left America in search of Soul Edge, which may become the key to his full memories. Through Sophitia's words, he returned to care for Bangoo, only to find him being kidnapped by Aeon Calcos/Lizardman whose cult demanded Rock's soul. He crossed back to Europe and rescued Bangoo. They stayed in Europe for several years until Bangoo grew older, after which Bangoo went to America by himself. Later, Rock is attacked by a giant named Astaroth whose moves have an uncanny resemblance to his own. He learned that Astaroth was created by Lizardman's cult based on his image and is now serving Nightmare. Rock determined to stop him at all costs. His fate afterward is not known, as no explanation is given for his absence in "Soulcalibur V".
Initially during development, the character was called "Beast Warrior", and his design changed little over the course of creating the character. His appearance is intended to reflect the atmosphere of a wild warrior, while his facial expressions were drawn in a positive manner, intended to show him enjoying the fight. When developing his appearance for "Soulcalibur", a clothed design and a bald appearance were both rejected, as the team felt they gave the impression of an urban or "bad guy" character, respectively.
Siegfried.
Siegfried's overall reception in the series has been positive. IGN has listed Siegfried together with Nightmare at the top of their "Top Ten Fighters" list of the series, calling Siegfried "a perfect representation of the series' core conflict." They also noted that "a Soul game simply feels incomplete without an appearance by the warring personalities of Siegfried and Nightmare." The character has also received praise for sporting an appealing, angelic design and a powerful, graceful fighting style. In a 2002 poll by Namco prior to the release of "Soulcalibur II" regarding their favorite character, Siegfried placed ninth with 2.5% of the tally, tied with Mitsurugi. In 2013, "Complex" enlisted the 20 best characters from the series, ranking Siegfried/Nightmare the best character, citing his duality as the reason that makes the character "one of the most fascinating characters in the entire series".
Introduced in "Soulcalibur".
Edge Master.
Edge Master was created by illustrator Yasushi Nirasawa, who had designed him as a background character and weapon shop owner for "Soul Edge Official Guidebook - Densetsu Buki Tankyū no Sho". Out of appreciation, Namco later introduced him as a playable character in "Soulcalibur" and a recurring series element. His age is intended to reflect his experience and strength.
Inferno.
Its will and power has directly and indirectly affected several other characters in the series, such as the "Evil Seed" event that caused many to turn somewhat evil or insane. It has also caused the creation of several life forms or modification of them, such as Ivy's sword, Charade, Necrid and Abyss.
Kilik.
During Kilik's initial design creation, while the weapon selected remained constant several ages and related appearances were considered. In particular amongst these was suggested a young boy whose design was based upon the legendary Chinese character Sun Wukong, the Monkey King. Other designs such as a feral appearance were considered, but unused due to them feeling "pretty wild" and too different from the initial concept.
Aeon Calcos / Lizardman.
, like Sophitia Alexandra, was one of the twenty-four warriors to receive an oracle from the god Hephaestus to destroy Soul Edge. A group of desert travelers rescued a dehydrated Aeon and brought him to their village. About to repay them by teaching them swordplay, the "Evil Seed" event occurred and turned him into a crazed killer that massacred everyone in the village. Astaroth's creator Kunpaetku heard stories of Aeon and captured him for experiments, transforming him into a . Ordered to bring Rock's adopted son to Europe, he was defeated while pursuing Soul Edge, which was destroyed moments later. Freed from his brainwashed state, he tried to restore his human form but was unable to and thus blamed Hephaestus for abandoning him. His state deteriorated further, gradually losing his humanity and memories. Taken in by a group of lizardmen like himself, he realized he lost his soul to Soul Edge, and sought to reclaim it. By the time of "Soulcalibur V", Lizardman's continued battles have changed his form to the point where he has grown wings and is able to breathe fire, resembling a dragon. Lizardman went through a few changes through his initial development, with several drafts remaining consistent in their design. However, at one point it was proposed to have the characters be exactly "half human, half reptile", and as a result in terrible pain.
Maxi.
After initially considering having Li Long return for "Soulcalibur", the development team instead focused on creating a new, younger nunchaku wielder for the title. After considering several ideas for his hairstyle, including several gag designs, the developers initially chose to give him dreadlocks before changing to the current appearance. Additionally, they opted to give him an outfit that would make him attractive, but also served as a partial nod to another fictional character, Takakazu Abe.
Xianghua.
During Xianghua's early design phase, several concepts were considered for her attire, before settling upon a light and oriental appearance for her. Additionally it was considered to have her appear as a young girl instead, or alternatively for her to fight unarmed using martial arts, an idea later put to effect through Heihachi Mishima and his appearance in "Soulcalibur II".
Introduced in "Soulcalibur II".
In addition to the characters below, lesser storyline related characters were included in console versions of the title as unlockable characters, appearing as recurring enemies in the game's "Weapon Master Mode". Assassin and Berserker served as counterparts to previous characters Hwang and Rock. Both would later appear as boss enemies in "Soulcalibur III", with Assassin's fighting style modified to utilize a kunai and Berserker modified into a smaller, fully armored warrior armed with a lance. Several generic Lizardmen also appear as recurring enemies and an unlockable character, utilizing an axe and shield fighting style that would be used by the original Lizardman in later appearances of the character.
Charade.
Charades appear in the game "Namco × Capcom" as enemy characters, mimicking Sophitia's fighting style from "Soulcalibur II". These Charades are unique in that Soul Edge creates them directly, an ability it lacks in the "Soul" series. Called Soul Edge's "avatars" by the game's protagonists, they are created by Soul Edge as foot soldiers and as a means to protect itself. When defeated, they will melt and dissolve into nothing.
Reception to Charade has been mixed. Netjack's Steve Lubitz described Charade as "Weapon Master, only uglier" and cited a lack of creativity with the design. The sentiment was shared by Deeko's review of "Soulcalibur II", who said that Charade felt like a new character that used "old character moves and tactics". Other reviewers of "II" repeated the sentement, noting Charade as one of several "Doppelgänger" fighters in the title that filled in another character's role. On the other hand UGO's Doug Trueman cited Charade as a character that "something spectacular to the "Soul Calibur" pantheon." and additionally received mention in UGO's "Top 11 Soul Calibur Fighters" article, losing to Olcadan only due to Olcadan's owl-inspired design.
Raphael.
Raphael's appearance in "Soulcalibur III" was changed heavily, designed to represent his evil demeanor and royal image. The chief character designer of the game, Hideo Yoshie, stated that the change made Raphael "more distinctive".
He also appeared in "Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2" as an unlockable character.
Introduced in "Soulcalibur III".
In addition to the characters below, several others appear within the game under the title of "bonus" characters, representing fighting styles exclusive to the game's character creation mode as unlockable characters. These include minor storyline characters such as Amy and Revenant, others from previous installments otherwise absent from the game such as Arthur, Li Long and Hwang, and characters exclusive to the game's "Chronicles of the Sword" mode. Of these, only Amy and Revenant would be included in later installments, with the former expanded into a full character and the latter appearing as a boss alongside Zasalamel.
Amy.
First seen in "Soulcalibur II" opening sequence, Amy's character model was reused with a modified design in "Soulcalibur III" as a debug character for the developers to test elements of the game with and against, also appearing in some of the game's epilogue sequences. After completion of most of the game, they decided to implement her as a full character as a result of liking her design. When she was announced as a playable character in the sequel for "Soulcalibur IV", game director Daishi Odashima stating the reason behind her inclusion as "I like weaker characters", noting her as one of his three favorite characters in the game.
Olcadan.
He received positive reception as a character due to his appearance and demeanor, placing in UGO.com's Top 11 SoulCalibur Fighters article at eleventh place, beating out fellow series mimic character Charade. They additionally awarded the character "Best New Character" of 2005, and proposed the possibility of Olcadan appearing in a stand-alone title and serving as a mascot for Namco, drawing comparisons to characters such as Master Chief. The character was additionally mentioned by them in their early coverage of "Soulcalibur IV", noting hope for his return in the title.
Setsuka.
Character developer Hideo Yoshie stated that Setsuka's concept originated from the idea of a flower. Her outfit in "Soulcalibur III" was inspired by historical Japanese courtesans known as oiran, who wore cosmetics and clothing similar to a geisha's but tied their obi at the front instead of behind, mixed with elements from the Queen of Hearts as part of a "East-meets-West" concept.
Zasalamel.
Zasalamel was positively received. "Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine" described Zasalamel as "easily the coolest" of the three new characters introduced in "Soulcalibur III", noting his speed and ability to pull opponents to him. Other reviewers have shared the sentiments, praising his accessibility for new players. GameSpy went further to described him as one of the best characters in "Soulcalibur III", noting his offensive abilities and range control.
Introduced in "Soulcalibur IV" and "Broken Destiny".
In addition to these characters, with "Soulcalibur IV" several manga and anime character designers were invited to contribute additional, non-canon characters to the game: Angol Fear, a female alien designed by Mine Yoshizaki and cousin of his existing character Angol Mois; Ashlotte, a mechanical doll developed by Oh! great sent to destroy series character Astaroth; Kamikirimusi, a young female oni designed by Hirokazu Hisayuki searching for kindred spirits; Scheherazade, an elven storyteller designed by Yutaka Izubuchi and based on the Persian queen of the same name; and Shura, a possessed female warrior designed by Hiroya Oku. Rather than having a unique fighting style, each was modeled after an existing character: Seong Mi-na, Astaroth, Nightmare, Amy, and Cervantes, respectively. Of these characters, only Ashlotte is referenced in later games, alluded to in Astaroth's "Soulcalibur V"s profile information.
Algol.
Character designer Hideo Yoshie described Algol as "a character that obviously proves the setting of being the strongest character ever in the "Soulcalibur" series". Algol's costume was designed around the concept of originating from a culture so ancient that it was not recorded in history, which complicated the character's creation. After considering several themes including a lion and a dinosaur, a bird motif was finally settled upon. An option was considered for Algol to cause an "off site brawl" while on a pipe chair, but was unused. His design elements including his projectile-firing "rifle arm" were called fresh and innovative by Gameswelt. The staff of 1UP.com were particularly impressed by his rifle attack, nicknaming the projectiles "Soul Bubbles" in reference to a game by the same name. Kotaku also praised the character, describing him as "much more of a bad ass" than recurring series boss Inferno. "Edge" described him as breaking the tradition of "ill-balanced uber-enemies" as well as one able to use a gun as a weapon without seeming "hopelessly out of place" in the series. "GameAxis Unwired" praised the character for breaking the series' tradition of bosses that mimicked existing fighting styles, and added that Algol remained for the most part fair to fight against. Neoseeker stated that Algol felt as if he was ""just there", purely for your entertainment", calling his fighting style bizarre but while frustrating to fight, beatable. Cheat Code Central included Algol in the 2012 list of top ten hidden characters in fighting games.
Geo "Le Bello" Dampierre.
Dampierre's introduction in the game was the result of the amount of unused character and weapon designs that were excluded from "Soulcalibur IV", and the team's desire to instead focus on creating a character based around their personality instead. Though the development team had mixed feelings regarding the character, they chose to take a risk and add him to "Broken Destiny" regardless.
Introduced in "Soulcalibur V".
Elysium.
Along with Edge Master and Kilik, she is a mimic character in "Soulcalibur V", mimicking the styles of female characters. Uniquely, she has a few unique moves when she mimics Pyrrha Omega, which are actually Sophitia's moves, and has a different Critical Edge unlike other mimic characters.
Leixia.
According to the game's official artbook, "SOULCALIBUR - New Legends of Project Soul", Xiba, one of Leixia's travel companion is actually her estranged older half-brother, the result of her mother's intimate meeting with Kilik. The reason why Xianghua had gone frantic at the sight of Dvapara-Yuga and decided to arrange Leixia's marriage with a general is because the pendant reminded her of Kilik she does not want her daughter to have an illegal affair like she had with Kilik.
Pyrrha.
Outside of the series, Pyrrha is the main character of "Queen's Gate: Pyrrha" (蒼運命に翻弄される娘 ピュラ), an erotic gamebook as part of the "Queen's Blade" series.
Viola.
Her weapons are a metal claw and a magical crystal ball which floats around during battles.
Xiba.
According to the official artbook of the game, "SOULCALIBUR - New Legends of Project Soul", he is actually Kilik and Xianghua's son and Leixia's estranged older half-brother. His birth is the result of their intimate meeting and he was nearly killed following the orders of the Xianghua's grandfather. Negotiations with Ming Empire general Yan Wujin however, allowed Xiba to live secretly with Xianghua's father Kong Xiuqiang so as to not revealing the scandal as the condition for Wujin to marry Xianghua. As many others such as Goku from Dragon Ball, his look and fighting style is based on Sun Wukong from the classic Chinese novel, Journey to the West.

The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids

"The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids" is a short story written by American writer Herman Melville (1819-1891). It first appeared in the April 1855 edition of "Harper's Magazine". Best known for his novel "Moby-Dick", Melville wrote numerous books and short stories. A combination of two sketches, one set in the center of London's legal industry and the other in a New England paper factory, this story can be read as an early comment on globalization. In the first sketch, the London bachelors, all lawyers, scholars, or writers, enjoy a sumptuous meal in a cozy apartment near the Temple Bar. In the second sketch, the New England "maids" are young women working in a paper factory. 
Inspiration.
Melville was inspired to write "The Paradise of Bachelors" by a trip to the Inns of Court in December 1849. "The Tartarus of Maids" was inspired by his visit to the Old Red Paper Mill in Dalton, Massachusetts in January, 1851.

Penis removal

In ancient civilizations, the removal of the human penis was sometimes used as a gesture of superiority or dominance for an enemy. Armies were sometimes known to sever the penises of their enemies to count the dead, as well as for trophies. The practice of castration (removal of the testicles) sometimes also involves the removal of all or part of the penis, generally with a tube inserted to keep the urethra open for urination. Castration has been used to create a class of servants or slaves called eunuchs in many different places and eras.
In the modern era, removing the human penis for any such activity is very rare and unheard of (with some exceptions listed below), and references to removal of the penis are almost always symbolic. Castration is less rare, and is performed as a last resort in the treatment of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer.
Penis removal in medicine and psychology.
Some men have penile amputations, known as penectomies, for medical reasons. Cancer, for example, sometimes necessitates removal of all or part of the penis. In some instances, botched childhood circumcisions have also resulted in full or partial penectomies.
Genital surgical procedures for trans women (transgender or transsexual women) undergoing sex reassignment surgery, do not usually involve the complete removal of the penis; part or all of the glans is usually kept and reshaped as a clitoris, and the skin of the penile shaft may also be inverted to form the vagina. When procedures such as this are not possible, other procedures such as colovaginoplasty are used which do involve the removal of the penis.
Issues related to the removal of the penis appear in psychology, for example in the condition known as castration anxiety. Others, who associate the organ with rape and male dominance and aggression, may consciously or subconsciously see the organ (their own or those of others) as a weapon and express a hatred for it, potentially desiring to see it violently removed.
Some men have undergone penectomies as a voluntary body modification, thus including it as part of a body dysmorphic disorder.
Professional opinion is divided regarding the desire for penile amputation as a pathology, much as all other forms of treatment by amputation for body dysmorphic disorder. Voluntary subincision, removal of the glans penis, and bifurcation of the penis are related topics.
History of involuntary penis removal.
China.
In ancient China, for heavy crimes including adultery, "licentious" or "promiscuous" activity, males had their penises removed in addition to being castrated. It was one of the Five Punishments that could be legally inflicted on criminals in China. They were designed to permanently disfigure for life. "Castration", in China, meant severing of the penis in addition to the testicles, after which male offenders were sentenced to work in the palace as eunuchs. The punishment was called "gongxing" (宫刑), which meant "palace punishment", since men castrated would be enslaved to work in the harem of the palace. It was also called "fuxing"(腐刑). Husbands who committed adultery were punished with castration as required under Zhou Dynasty law. While men were castrated, women who committed adultery were punished by confinement. The exact crime was called Gong, and referred to "immoral" heterosexual sex between males and females. The punishment stated- "If a male and female engage in intercourse without morality, their punishments shall be castration and sequestration ."
Japan.
The removal of the penis was used as a punishment for men in Heian period Japan, where it replaced execution. It was called "rasetsu" 羅切 (らせつ), and was separate from castration which was called "kyūkei" 宮刑 (きゅうけい), which was removal of the testicles. Rasetsu was done voluntarily by some Japanese Buddhist priests to ensure celibacy. Rasetsu was also known in Edo period Japan.
The word rasetsu was made out of the components "ra" from "mara" which meant penis, and "setsu", which meant cutting.
The word Rasetsu was used in Japanese literature.
Kyuukei in Japanese law referred to the punishment of castration, which was used for male offenders, and confinement for females.
Sexual assault.
There have been incidents in which men have been assaulted, usually by their sexual partners, by having their penises severed. The case of John and Lorena Bobbitt, for example, was popularly known for Lorena Bobbitt cutting off the penis of her husband, John, out of rage after he allegedly raped her, though he claimed it was for revenge when she discovered his infidelity. Bobbitt's penis was successfully reattached, and he later had a brief career in pornographic movies.
This was not the first modern case, however. On May 18, 1936, Sada Abe strangled her lover Kichizo Ishida (believed to be at his request, he wanted to die while having sex) and cut off his penis, placed it in her kimono and carried it around with her for days before eventually turning it over to the police. She spent a very brief time in jail, and was granted amnesty in 1940. The penis was last seen at a department store exhibition in 1949. This episode was the basis of the film "In the Realm of the Senses".
Mutilation or forcible removal of the penis has special symbolic significance. As a symbol of male sexuality, fertility, and masculinity, the removal of the penis may be inspired by a desire to emasculate, and sometimes results in the emasculation of the victim. Another motive, particularly in cases of spousal assault, is sexual.
From 1973 to 1980 one hundred cases of Thai women cutting off their husband's penises were recorded. Most of them were not reattached. Only with eighteen out of the hundred Thai men whose penises were severed was reattachment even attempted, and the reattachments were abysmal. The spate was due to the prevalent practice of Thai men keeping secondary "wives" as sexual partners, which was permitted in traditional Thai culture but currently modern Thai law enforces monogamy. The spate of penis severings was stimulated by Thai women agitating and instigating more women to commit the act.
Most Thai women who cut their husband's penis are not prosecuted. Dr. Surasak Muangsombut is a prominent Thai surgeon known for reattaching penises. He attached 32 penises, most of them cut by wives who drugged their husbands due to adultery. In all of his cases none of the women faced prosecution since the predominant view in Thailand is that the men deserve it.
In 2003, a rise in domestic violence by Chinese women against Chinese men was reported, including beatings and occasionally women cutting off their husband's penis.
In 2006, in Vietnam, a spate of Vietnamese women cutting off their husband's penises due to adultery, alcoholism and abuse was reported in southern Vietnam. All fifteen incidents reported occurred close to Ho Chi Minh City. In twelve of the incidents the penis was rejoined to the body. It was noted that Thailand's many cases of penis severings could have played a role in the events in Vietnam, since the attacks were abnormal for Vietnamese women.
An article titled "Status Quo of Female Criminals in Nanjing" was translated on the All-China Women's Federation's website on July 21, 2008, concerning the rise in young female criminals over the previous three years, numbering 2,140 and mostly aged 35 or younger. Under "Crime Caused by Impulsion", it stated that several incidents in Nanjing in China occurred where Chinese men had their penis severed by their wives. An explanation given by a procurator said "Their reasons are simple. The wife could not bear the fact that her husband is gambling or cheating on her. It is a crime of impulsion in an emotional crisis." It also stated the majority of the women criminals in Nanjing were given lenient jail time or not punished at all.
On August 15, 2008, it was reported in Thailand that a domestic abuse study of the previous decade by Mahidol University uncovered that some Thai men had their penises cut off by their wives due to rampant sexual abuse and other attacks on women.
Treatment and effects of penis removal.
Severing the penis without removing the testicles causes intense sexual frustration, since sexual urges and drive originate from the testicles but with no penis there is no way to satisfy them. It is unclear because of the reluctance of victims of penis removal who have undergone penis reconstruction surgery to go to checkups, but acute pain when sitting on a bicycle saddle or other similar surfaces (and perhaps other activities that put much weight on the crotch area) may persist for a long period of time after the surgery, or even permanently.
A study of penis reattachment in China, found that of a group of 50 men, all but one reacquired functionality, even though some involved full reconstructive surgery using tissue and bone. Reportedly some of these men later fathered children.
If reattachment is not an option, doctors can reconstruct a penis from muscle and skin grafted from another part of the body like the forearm. However, a penile implant is needed for erection to be possible, the reconstructed penis would look strange and would either not be able to ejaculate, or ejaculate with less force. The patients are often dissatisfied with the reconstructed penis. Standing during urination is an advantage offered by a reconstructed penis. If penis reconstruction is not done, the patient would have to squat in order to urinate since doctors reroute the entrance of the urethra to below the scrotum.

Blepharizonia plumosa

Blepharizonia plumosa is a species of tarweed known by the common name big tarweed. It is endemic to central California, where it grows in the Central Coast Ranges and adjacent sections of the southern San Francisco Bay Area and Central Valley. This is a glandular, aromatic annual herb producing a hairy, erect stem which may approach two meters in maximum height. The leaves are linear in shape and sometimes toothed, the largest located near the base of the plant reaching 15 centimeters long. The inflorescence bears several flower heads, each with a fringe of up to 13 red-veined white ray florets just under a centimeter long. The center of each head is filled with protruding tubular disc florets with large dark anthers. The fruit is a hairy, club-shaped achene which may or may not have a pappus at the tip. 
"Blepharizonia" is sometimes treated as a monotypic genus, and sometimes as a genus with two species. One variety or subspecies of "B. plumosa" is sometimes treated as a separate species called "Blepharizonia laxa".

LNER Thompson Class A2/3

The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) Class A2/3 was a class of 4-6-2 steam locomotives.
They were newly constructed locomotives, fulfilling the requirement identified by Edward Thompson for a standard express passenger locomotive of the 4-6-2 arrangement with 6 ft 2in driving wheels. Fifteen engines were constructed according to this original design, but following the retirement of Thompson as CME, the remaining fifteen locomotives that were planned were immediately redesigned and ultimately emerged as Peppercorn Class A2. The information in the infobox (right) is taken from Ian Allan ABC.
According to OS Nock, the class were regarded as being effective performers, but suffered from a defect of exhaust detail, this being attributed to the long steam passages from the cylinders to the blastpipe, a fault with engines that have substantial distances between the inside and outside cylinders, which was a characteristic Thompson Pacific design. the long frames and long connecting rods caused a substantial amount of frame shift, and the class were known for shaking bolts loose.

LNER Thompson Class A2/2

The London and North Eastern Railway Class A2/2 was a class of 4-6-2 steam locomotives. The A2/2 were former members of Sir Nigel Gresley’s P2 Class of eight-coupled express passenger locomotives. Edward Thompson was appointed on the 28 April 1941 and decided to gain experience by rebuilding the P2 Class, the first of which to be rebuilt was No. 2005, "Thane Of Fife" in 1943. Thompson changed the wheel arrangement from 2-8-2 to a 4-6-2 'Pacific' configuration and all the other P2s were rebuilt similarly during 1944.
As P2 configuration, the engines had proved to be powerful locomotives, but the long fixed wheelbase made them maintenance intensive, and Thompson saw this is a chance to try out his own thoughts on pacific design. Thompson believed that divided drive between the front and middle axles should be used, and also that connecting rods should be all of equal length, a theory shared neither by his predecessor or his successor. the great length of the P2 frames were such that they could be changed to a pacific 4-6-2 arrangement, and give Thompson the necessary spacing required for his divided drive layout.
During their lifetime in steam "Earl Marischal" was the only A2/2 to cover over one million miles in service, 360,907 as a P2 and 673,947 as an A2/2. The information in the infobox (right) is taken from Ian Allan ABC.

Timeline of the 2008–09 South Pacific cyclone season

The 2008–09 South Pacific cyclone season was a below-average season with only six tropical cyclones occurring within the South Pacific between 160°E and 120°W. The season officially ran from November 1, 2008 to April 30, 2009 with the first disturbance of the season forming on December 1 and the last disturbance moving out of the region on April 11.
For the fourth season in a row tropical cyclone activity in the South Pacific was below its climatological average of nine tropical cyclones, with only six tropical cyclones occurring within the region. The most damaging tropical disturbance was Tropical Depression 04F which also was the deadliest tropical disturbance occurring during the season. The depression caused $ (2009 USD; $  USD) in damage and killed twelve people when it caused the worst economic natural disaster in Viti Levu since the drought of 1998.
During the season tropical cyclones were monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. RSMC Nadi attached a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that formed in or moved into the South Pacific. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also issued unofficial warnings throughout during the season, designating tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measured windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC measured sustained winds over a period of one minute and uses the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.
This timeline includes information from post-storm reviews by RSMC Nadi, TCWC Wellington and the JTWC. It documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. Reports among warning centers often differ; as such, information from all three agencies has been included.

2009 Gator Bowl

The 2009 Gator Bowl was played on January 1, 2009 as part of the 2008 College Football season. It featured the Nebraska Cornhuskers, who finished tied for first in the Big 12 Conference's North Division with Missouri, and the Clemson Tigers, who finished fifth in the Atlantic Coast Conference's Atlantic Division. Nebraska scored 16 unanswered points to beat Clemson after being down 21-10 in the third quarter. This game was the first meeting between the Clemson Tigers and the Nebraska Cornhuskers since the 1982 Orange Bowl where Clemson defeated Nebraska for their first and only national title. This was the second game between both schools with Nebraska evening up the record.
The Gator Bowl is an annual college football bowl game that is played at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. It is one of the oldest college bowls, held continuously since 1946. Its current full name is the Konica Minolta Gator Bowl after its present sponsor, Konica Minolta.
Overview.
The Gator Bowl has tie-ins from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), Big 12 Conference, and Big East Conferences, as well as independent Notre Dame. They have the right to the third pick of a team from the ACC, and have the option to offer the other spot to the second pick from the Big East, the fourth pick from the Big 12, or Notre Dame. The 2009 game featured the ACC's Clemson Tigers, who finished the 2008 season with an overall record of 7-5 (4-4 in the ACC) playing the Big 12's Nebraska Cornhuskers, who finished the 2008 season with an overall record of 8–4 (5–3 in the Big 12). Clemson went to the Chick-fil-A Bowl in 2007, while Nebraska did not qualify for a bowl game.
Teams.
University of Nebraska-Lincoln Cornhuskers.
Nebraska opened up the season with 3 straight wins against Western Michigan, San Jose State, and New Mexico State. Bo Pelini's arrival saw a renewed interest and optimism in Nebraska football, as evidenced by their record Pay-Per View buys.
Nebraska then proceeded to lose a close game to Virginia Tech, while getting beat by Missouri the next week. Hitting the road for the first time of the season, the Huskers lost to Texas Tech in overtime. Then the Huskers traveled to Ames, Iowa and beat Iowa State University in a dominant fashion. They came back home and won against the Baylor Bears. Pelini's Huskers then lost on the road the following week to the Oklahoma Sooners. This game marked the first time Pelini went up against Bob Stoops who he formerly worked under as defensive coordinator at the University of Oklahoma in 2004.
On November 8, Bo Pelini's Nebraska Cornhuskers won against Kansas, making them bowl eligible, something his predecessor, Bill Callahan, was able to accomplish only twice in four years. On November 28, 2008, the Cornhuskers faced the Colorado Buffaloes. This game proved to be a close one, with Nebraska getting win #8, 40–31 with the help of a school record 57 yard field goal by Alex Henery and an interception by Ndamukong Suh which was run back for a touchdown. This victory tied Nebraska with Missouri for first in the Big 12 North, although Missouri represented the division in the conference championship game because of its tie-breaking, head-to-head win over the Huskers.
Clemson Tigers.
The season started with head coach Tommy Bowden, who resigned six games into his tenth season with a 3-3 record in 2008. The interim head coach Dabo Swinney took over the team and had a 4-2 record going into the Gator Bowl.
Recap.
After both teams traded punts throughout most of the first and second quarters, DeAndre McDaniel of Clemson scored on a 28 yard fumble return, with 4:52 in the second, after he batted down a pitch by Joe Ganz. The Cornhuskers battled back, and were able to tack on a 48 yard Alex Henery field goal with 1:10 left in the first half. Clemson was driving for another score before the half when Cullen Harper's pass was deflected and picked off by Nebraska. On the next play, Joe Ganz threw an interception right back to Clemson. Clemson capitalized with a 25 yard touchdown catch by Aaron Kelly with just 0:35 left in the half. Clemson took a 14–3 lead into halftime.
Quarterback Joe Ganz drove the Huskers the length of the field on Nebraska's first possession of the second half, capping off with a 17 yard touchdown catch by Nate Swift to bring the Huskers within four. After Nebraska receiver Niles Paul botched the punt return, Clemson's Jacoby Ford caught a 41 yard touchdown pass to put Clemson up 21–10.
Nebraska struck back with Joe Ganz eventually finding receiver Todd Peterson from 17 yards out for a touchdown to bring the Huskers within four points of Clemson at 21-17. Nebraska's Blackshirt defense intercepted Clemson quarterback Cullen Harper on the next drive. The turnover led to an Alex Henery 28-yard field goal to bring Nebraska within one point at 21–20. Clemson went three-and-out on their next four drives while Nebraska managed two field goals to bring the score to a 26–21 Nebraska lead.
Despite the success of the Nebraska defense, Clemson held one more drive for a go-ahead touchdown. With no timeouts, Clemson converted on a third down and later a fourth down until they eventually drove down to the NU 10 yard line for a 1st & Goal situation. On 2nd & Goal, Nebraska cornerback Eric Hagg sacked Cullen Harper for 16 yards back at the NU 26. On 3rd & Goal, Harper found his tailback C.J. Spiller in the endzone, only to have the ball knocked from Spiller's hands by Cornhusker safety, Matt O'Hanlon. Facing a 4th & Goal, Harper threw an incomplete pass to end their drive, giving the ball back to Nebraska with no way to stop the clock. Nebraska kneeled on the ball three times, ending the game and giving the Huskers the 26-21 victory.
Aftermath.
The Nebraska Cornhuskers head coach Bo Pelini continued his perfect postseason record to 2-0. Pelini's 2008 regular season record of 9-4 was the highest among all 28 Division 1A teams with new head coaches and staffs that year.
Ndamukong Suh was named to the all Bowl team award.

Sales process engineering

Sales process engineering is the engineering of better sales processes. It is thus the quest to design better ways of selling, making salespeople's efforts more productive. It has been described as "the systematic application of scientific and mathematical principles to achieve the practical goals of a particular sales process". Selden pointed out that in this context, sales referred to the output of a process involving a variety of functions across an organization, and not that of a "sales department" alone. Primary areas of application span functions including sales, marketing, and customer service.
History.
As early as 1900–1915, advocates of scientific management, such as Frederick Winslow Taylor and Harlow Stafford Person, recognized that their ideas could be applied not only to manual labour and skilled trades but also to management, professions, and sales. Person promoted an early form of sales process engineering. At the time, our postwar senses of the terms "sales process engineering" and "sales engineering" did not yet exist; Person called his efforts "sales engineering". 
The evolution of modern corporate life in the 1920s through 1960s, exemplified by professional management monographs of the time, further sought to apply analysis and synthesis to improve the methods of salespeople as well as the rest of the office workforce.
Management trends of the 1980s and 1990s, such as business process reengineering, influenced sales process engineering as much as many other business processes. The upturn in interest in applying a more systematic approach to these areas was spurred by a number of factors. Todd Youngblood (2004) emphasized "three core principles" that typify such efforts. His principles were continuous improvement of the sales process; metrics to quantitatively judge the rate and degree of improvement; and a well-defined sales process.
In the 2000s and 2010s, the evolution of customer relationship management (CRM) and salesforce automation, especially the development of powerful new web-based software to automate and augment them (CRM systems, sales force management systems, marketing information systems), has been the forefront of increasing the productivity of sales and marketing people.
Future directions.
As in other areas of applied science, future directions for sales process engineering include broadening the available pool of underlying observational data (the standard refrain of "more research is needed"); publishing further application of the principles; and advancing educational efforts to teach and disseminate the relevant body of knowledge.

Aesthetic canon

A canon in the sphere of visual arts and aesthetics, or an aesthetic canon, is a rule for proportions, so as to produce a harmoniously formed figure.
Evolution.
By extension, the norms of a certain epoch as to what is or is not considered beautiful may be called a canon of beauty. These norms have varied over time and what is considered beautiful in one era may not necessarily be so in another. Canons of beauty follow the evolution of fashion and are dependent on the evolution of physical decoration techniques such as hairdressing or make up.
Under France's Ancien Régime, canons of beauty required a woman to have as white a skin as possible. This was achieved (sometimes to the danger of health) by rouge and face powders as well as 'mouches', fake moles made of black muslin glued onto the face or chest. Today, by contrast, such canons prefer a 'healthier' skin colour, sportiness, gait and so on.
According to the anthropologist Alfred-Louis Kroeber, the female silhouette regularly revolves through one of three basic shapes—bustle, scabbard, bell.
Proportions in art.
For his painting "The Birth of Venus" Sandro Botticelli stated that the distance between the nipple and navel, between the two legs and between the navel and the groin must all be equal for a figure to (in his opinion) be ideally proportioned. Other such systems of 'ideal proportions' in painting and sculpture include the Polyclitean canon and Vitruvian modules, best known in the Vitruvian Man.

History of the flags of Romania

The colors of the national flag of Romania () have a long history. Red, yellow and blue were found on late 16th-century royal grants of Michael the Brave, as well as shields and banners. Thus, the late 13th century Wijbergen armorial shows the coat of arms of the Wallachian king Litovoi as consisting of a shield of ten vertically alternating gold-and-red bands, which were the colors of the coat of arms of the Second Bulgarian Empire, of which Wallachia was part. The same two colors, gules and or, also appeared on the late 15th century flag and coat of arms of Moldavia, during the reign of Stephen the Great [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ro-mold.html]. Then, from the late 16th century until the mid-17th century, the historical coat of arms of Transylvania gradually developed as a shield party per fess, consisting of a black eagle on blue background in the upper field, a dividing red band in the middle, and seven red towers on golden background in the lower field. Finally, in the last quarter of the 18th century, Bukovina gets its own coat of arms from the Habsburg Empire, a blue-and-red shield party per pale with a black aurochs' head in the middle, and three golden six-pointed stars surrounding it. During the Wallachian uprising of 1821, they were present on the canvas of the revolutionaries' flag and its fringes; for the first time a meaning was attributed to them: "Liberty (sky-blue), Justice (field yellow), Fraternity (blood red)".
Tricolor.
The tricolor was first adopted in Wallachia in 1834, when the reforming "domnitor" Alexandru II Ghica submitted naval and military colors designs for the approval of Sultan Mahmud II. The latter was a “flag with a red, blue and yellow face, also having stars and a bird’s head in the middle”. Soon, the order of colors was changed, with yellow appearing in the center. When the flags were handed over for use, Ghica remarked:
In 1840, in order to differentiate the military colors from the war flag, Ghica adopted a new design for the former: a red-yellow-blue tricolor, with red on top and stripes of equal width. In the center was a white shield bordered with gold and decorated with the Wallachian eagle, wearing the princely crown and with a cross in its beak.
In 1848, the flag adopted for Wallachia by the revolutionaries that year was a blue-yellow-red tricolor (with blue above, in line with the meaning “Liberty, Justice, Fraternity”). Already on 26 April, according to "Gazeta de Transilvania", Romanian students in Paris were hailing the new government with a blue, gold and red national flag, “as a symbol of union between Moldavians and Muntenians”. 
Decree nr. 1 of 14/26 June 1848 of the provisional government mentioned that “the National Flag will have three colors: blue, yellow, red”, emblazoned with the words “DPEПTATE ФPЪЦIE” ("Dreptate, Frăţie" or “Justice, Fraternity”, in the Romanian transitional alphabet). It differed from earlier tricolors in that the blue stripe was on top, the princely symbol was eliminated from the corners, as was the crown atop the eagle at the end of the flagpole, while a motto was now present. These flags were blessed the following day, being intended for use by the National Guard. Today only the Slatina city guard’s flag survives. On the blue stripe appear the words ("Frăţie Dreptate" or “Fraternity, Justice”), on the yellow — ("Judeţul Oltŭ" or “Olt County”) and on the red — ("Oraşul Slatina" or “The City of Slatina”). It is 124 centimeter long and 110 centimeter wide. The existence of similar flags is confirmed by records, which in some cases even mention the manufacturer’s price. Thus, the police observer’s flag (made of "chalon" or cloth friezed on both sides) and that of the Bucharest "dorobanţi" detachment (made of Tibet wool) together cost 192 lei and 10 parale. Decree nr. 5 of 18 June ordered garrisons to store old flags in warehouses: “it being necessary to change flags, new flags will soon be sent to you”. On 25 June, General Christian Tell asked the provisional government to approve the manufacture of six flags (three for the infantry and three for the cavalry), following which they would be “submitted to the provisional government for approval”. His request was granted on 11 July, though the flags were not distributed until 11 September, in a solemn ceremony. On 30 June, Metropolitan Neofit, as prime minister, gave the following disposition: “the standards of liberty will be raised on all buildings, and the insignia will be carried”. These symbols were widely employed in demonstrations and raised on public buildings, boats, warships, etc.
Nevertheless, decree nr. 252 of 13/25 July 1848, issued because “it has not been agreed how the national standards should be designed”, defined the flag as three "vertical" stripes, possibly influenced by the French model. The shades were “dark blue, light yellow and carmine red”; as for order, “near the wood comes blue, then yellow and then red fluttering”.
Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel observes that from a heraldic point of view, on the French as well as the revolutionary Wallachian flag, the middle stripe represents a heraldic metal (argent and or respectively). Other writers believe that the tricolor was not an imitation of the French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by a note from the revolutionary foreign minister to Emin Pasha: “the colors of the band that we the leaders wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. We have had our flags since an earlier time. When we received the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion”.
Earlier, at the Sibiu Conference of 26 April/8 May 1848, Transylvanian revolutionaries had also adopted a blue-"white"-red national flag (vertical, according to the memoirs of George Bariţ). It was emblazoned with the words “VIRTUTEA ROMANĂ REÎNVIATĂ” (“ROMAN VIRTUE RESURRECTED”). A number of contemporary sources attests these colors (including the Blaj newspaper "Organul naţionale" and Alexandru Papiu Ilarian’s "Istorie a românilor din Dacia superioară"). They had a twofold significance: their importance in Romanian costume and their union of the Transylvanian principality’s old colors (blue and red) with the white symbolizing peace. It appears that the two specimens with blue-yellow-red stripes preserved today at the National Museum of Romanian History were made later to commemorate the events at Blaj; yellow replaced white as a symbol of Romanian Transylvanians’ desire to join Romania.
After the revolution was quelled, the old flags were restored and the revolutionaries punished for having worn the tricolor. In 1849, "domnitor" Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei adopted a new design for military colors that nevertheless preserved the colors’ horizontal layout and only changed decorative elements. Similar to the 1834 flag, this one lasted until 1856.
During the Caimacam of three (October 1858-January 1859), as the acting regents did not have the right to inscribe their initials on military flags, the monograms of the Wallachian "domnitori" were replaced by eagles.
Merger legend.
After 1860, a legend arose stating that the national tricolor had been formed by merging the colors of the Moldavian and Wallachian flags, probably out of a desire to reconcile all parties to the fact that the Wallachian revolutionary flag of 1848 had been chosen for all of Romania. This legend was also convenient with respect to the colors attributed to the two principalities’ flags at the time (red and blue for Moldavia and blue and yellow for Wallachia).
The legend inspired a number of artworks, including a painting by Constantin Lecca. Wishing to depict the brotherhood between Moldavians and Wallachians, chose a passage from the "Bistriţa Chronicle": “In the year 7015 (1506), October 28, prince Ioan Bogdan Voievod entered the Muntenian land with all his troops to the place Rătezat, near the hillock Căiata, on that side of the Râmnic; and there arrived an emissary from Radu Voievod [...] who begged prince Bogdan Voievod to make peace with Radu Voievod, because ‘you are Christians and from the same people’ (said he); and many words were exchanged between them and much begging was made [...] and prince Bogdan Voievod, seeing so much begging, followed his wishes and made peace”. Lecca’s painting shows the two "domnitori" shaking hands in the center. The flags of Moldavia (blue-red) and of Wallachia (yellow-blue) can also be seen, although these color combination have not been attested prior to 1832-34.
P. V. Năsturel contests this legend, noting that the red-yellow-blue tricolor predated the union of the principalities and that the three colors, arrayed vertically, represent the flag of the Romanian nation in all lands inhabited by Romanians.
In 1848, the tricolor was present in Focşani and Râmnicu Sărat (on opposite sides of the principalities’ border) during demonstrations of fraternity held by Moldavians and Wallachians, while in 1857, around the time of the Moldavian "Ad hoc Divan", the civilian population adopted the tricolor as a symbol of union, a fact observed by Count Alexandre Walewski, French foreign minister.
Also that year, the minister of foreign affairs of the Wallachian provisional government assured the extraordinary envoy of the Porte, Suleiman Pasha, that the flag’s three colors had existed “for a long time; our ancestors bore them on their standard and their flags. So they are not a borrowing or an imitation from the present or a threat for the future”.
Another of Lecca’s paintings shows the assassination of Michael the Brave in 1601. Also depicted is the united standard of the three provinces, with yellow on top (Wallachia), red in the middle (Moldavia) and blue below (Transylvania). This hypothesis of the three colors’ union has appeared in historical literature, also engendering skepticism regarding the arguments deployed in its favor.
Flags of the United Principalities.
On 6 February 1859, on his first journey to Bucharest since being elected "domnitor" of Wallachia, Alexandru Ioan Cuza was greeted at the edge of the city of Buzău by the commander of the "dorobanţi", who was carrying a tricolor flag. The sight deeply moved Cuza.
Until 1861 the old flags of Moldavia and Wallachia were used alongside the tricolor. On 22 June of that year, Cuza decreed the tricolor as the United Principalities’ official civil flag.
The flag was the red-yellow-blue Romanian tricolor, with horizontal stripes. Neither the order of stripes nor the proportion of the civil flag are known. This is first described in "Almanahul român din 1866": “the tricolor flag, divided in three stripes, red, yellow and blue and laid out horizontally: red above, blue below and yellow in the middle”. Some sources suggest that the top stripe was blue until 1862 (as in the revolutionary Wallachian tricolor of 1848), replaced that year by red. An approximate ratio of 1:3 has been suggested, although the princely and army flags, both preserved, had a 2:3 proportion. As for symbolism, P. V. Năsturel asserts that “from 1859 to 1866 it represented just what it had done in 1848: "liberty, justice, fraternity"".
The flag gained a degree of international recognition. Relating prince Cuza’s May–June 1864 journey to Constantinople, doctor Carol Davila observed: “The Romanian flag was raised on the great mast, the Sultan’s kayaks awaited us, the guard was armed, the Grand Vizier at the door... The Prince, quiet, dignified, concise in his speech, spent 20 minutes with the Sultan, who then came to review us... Once again, the Grand Vizier led the Prince to the main gate and we returned to the Europe Palace, the Romanian flag still fluttering on the mast...”
Princely flag.
A rather worn tricolor is found today in the collections of the National Museum of Romanian History, with inventory number 75045. Rectangular in shape (with a 2:3 ratio), it is made up of three silk strips laid out horizontally (with red on top. In the center-right of the flag is painted the Wallachian eagle, a cross in its beak and clutching the symbols of princely power, while the Moldavian aurochs appears on the center-left, a six-pointed star between its horns. Six inclined tricolor flags surround the two symbols (three on the left and three on the right); their flagpoles probably crossed near the bottom, which is now lost. Each flag has a blue ribbon above it and at the tips of their flagpoles are found, one on each side, a Wallachian eagle, the edge of a lance and a Moldavian aurochs. On the red strip are found stitched a princely crown, situated in the center so as to mark the two coats of arms, and the statement “UNIREA PRINCIPATELOR — FERICIREA ROMÂNILOR. TRĂIASCĂ A. IOAN I!” (“The Union of the Principalities — the joy of Romanians. Long Live A. Ioan I!”) on both sides of the crown and now partially faded. The flagpole ends in a metal sphere topped by an eagle.
Researchers differ on the origin and date of this flag. Col. Dr. Alexandru Vasile and Dr. Maria Ioniţă consider that this was the United Principalities’ official flag. The latter dates it to 1859, the period immediately after the Union, as does Dan Cernovodeanu. Mario to believes it was a military colors used between 1859 and 1861.
Elena Pălănceanu and Cornelia Apostol believe it was a princely flag designed in 1862, after the full union of the two entities, proclaimed on 11/24 December 1861. Indeed, Cuza only adopted the title “Alexandru Ion I” after this date.
After Cuza’s abdication, the flag was kept at the Bucharest Army Arsenal until 1919, when it was transferred to the National Military Museum. It has been at its present location since 1971.
It seems that this specimen was preceded by another, dating to 1859, featuring a tricolor canvas with somewhat smaller dimensions. In this flag, the blue strip is on top, while the two principalities’ coats of arms are no longer surrounded by flags. Today the inscription on the blue strip is illegible, but differed from that found on the other flag.
Another princely flag, rather different from contemporary designs, is a silk tricolor with vertical stripes (blue hoist) and a princely crown painted in the center. It was raised whenever the "domnitor" was present at Ruginoasa Castle. Today it is found at the Suceava History Museum, part of the Bukovina Museum Complex.
Military colors.
Article 45 of the Paris Convention (1858) provided that “the armies of both countries will keep their present flags; but these flags will feature, in the future, a blue banderole, in conformity with the design attached to the present Convention”.
On 18 March 1863, the War Minister, General Ion Emanuel Florescu, asked Cuza to approve a design for army flags, agreed upon by the government in its session of 12 March. The flags featured the national tricolor (horizontal stripes, with red on top), over which was a Roman eagle with a cross in its beak. In a solemn order of the day on 19 March, Cuza decided: “Considering that the army, following the union, should have but one flag; keeping in mind that the true emblem of Romania can only be the Roman eagle, [...] we have decreed and do decree what follows: the Roman eagle with cross in its mouth shall be placed, as the emblem of Romania, above the army’s flags [...]”
The resulting designs, distributed on 1 September 1863, differ somewhat from those legislated in March. This, the Roman eagle, wings outstretched, wearing the princely crown, carries the princely scepter in its right talon and the sword in its left; on its breast appears an open shield topped by the princely crown. On the left of the shield, over azure and gold, is the Wallachian eagle (a cross in its beak, in left profile and wearing the princely crown); on the right, over red and azure, is the Moldavian aurochs with a star between its horns. Hanging from the scepter and sword is a red ribbon with gold-embossed letters: “HONOR ET PATRIA” (“honor and Fatherland”). In the fly corners the prince’s initial is stitched, surrounded by a laurel wreath; all are golden. Each flag also had inscribed the unit that bore it. The cloth part was 122 centimeter long and 100 centimeter wide. A metal Roman eagle was affixed to the tip of the flagpole. Although the order of 19 March had the Moldavian symbol in the right, nevertheless the first on the shield is the Wallachian eagle. The design was most likely adopted due to customary usage that arose after Bucharest became the single capital in February 1862.
These flags were distributed to the following units:
With the occasion of handing over the flags, Cuza delivered the following speech:
These flags were used until 1866 when, after Cuza’s abdication, they were changed. Four army flags of the 1863 design are preserved today.
Romanian flags until 1918.
Article 124 of the 1866 Constitution of Romania provided that “the colors of the United Principalities will be Blue, Yellow and Red”. The order and placement of the colors were decided by the Assembly of Deputies in its session of 26 March 1867. Thus, following a proposal by Nicolae Golescu, they were placed just as in 1848. The commission’s work continued on 30 March as well; following an affirmative vote by the Senate, these wrapped up with the adoption, on 12/24 April 1867, of the “Law for fixing the arms of Romania”.
According to this, the flag’s colors had to be placed vertically in the following order: blue hoist, yellow in the middle and red fly. The country’s coat of arms was placed only on army and princely flags, in the center; civilian flags remained without a coat of arms. The same distinction was made between flags for the naval war fleet and the civilian fleet.
The rapporteur Mihail Kogălniceanu, who also conveyed the opinion of Cezar Bolliac, Dimitrie Brătianu, Constantin Grigorescu, Ion Leca, Nicolae Golescu and Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino, said: “The tricolor flag as it is today is not (as the minister claims) the flag of the Union of the principalities. It is much more: it is itself the flag of the Romanian nation in all lands inhabited by Romanians”.
The “Law for modifying the country’s arms” of 11/23 March 1872 did not change these provisions, only the design of the coat of arms. The design proposed by Ştefan Dimitrie Grecianu was adopted.
Princely and royal standard.
According to the laws of 1867 and 1872, the princely (later royal) standard was identical to that of the army, with the country’s coat of arms in the center.
Nevertheless, when these were produced a slightly different design was adopted: the yellow stripe was twice as wide as the red and blue ones, and the canvas had a 1:1 ratio. Each corner of the flag had sewn into it a silver royal crown. The crown prince’s standard was identical except that it lacked the crowns in the corners.
An album dating to the end of the 19th century and the October 1917 "National Geographic Magazine" show the flags as having stripe ratios of 1:3:1.
Military colors.
]
Right after Alexander John Cuza’s abdication, the military units’ military colors were replaced with a new 1866 design; instead of the coat of arms, the name of the company appeared on the standards. However, the eagle at the edge of the flagpole was preserved.
The flags distributed to the Civic Guard, re-established in March 1866, had a different design—the colors were vertical, in the center was found the respective city’s coat of arms and not the national one, and the eagle at the end of the lance was larger and featured the shield of the United Principalities on its breast. P. V. Năsturel classifies these as "1867 design flags" and describes them in detail: the canvas was 114 centimeter long and 95 centimeter wide (so a 5:6 ratio) and in the center was painted the respective city’s coat of arms, covered with a golden mural crown. In the corners, surrounded by laurel wreaths, the number of the legion was stitched in Roman numerals. Golden fringes surrounded the canvas, with tassels from the same fabric hanging at the corners. The eagle at the end of the flagpole had its wings facing downward, had the princely crown on its head and carried a sceptre in its right hand and a sword in its left; all were made of gold. A shield was carved into the eagle’s breast, with the Wallachian eagle in the first half and the Moldavian aurochs’ head in the second. Above the sword and sceptre a ribbon passed bearing the inscription “Honor et Patria”. On 11 September 1867, Prince Carol I solemnly handed over these flags to the Civic Guards.
In 1873 it was decided that the 1866 design military flags would be replaced with the "1872 design", following the Law for the modification of the national coat of arms of 1872. Design-wise, these fall into several generations.
"Flags produced in 1873" (24 flags and 10 standards), of which only one, the Firemen’s, survived in 1900, were square, 150 centimeter on each side. In its center was painted, on a maroon background surrounded by a closed wreath of silver laurels, Romania’s middle coat of arms. The monogram of Prince Carol was in the corners, surrounded by a laurel crown, while the flagpole was topped by a metal eagle with the motto “Onóre şi Patria” ("honor and Fatherland") as well as the unit’s number and name. The cavalry flags had canvases of reduced dimensions (45 centimeter), while the decorative elements were embroided and not painted. All these insignia were distributed to the units on 14 October 1874, on the field at Băneasa.
"Flags produced between 1877 and 1882" differ slightly from the preceding ones. On 17 July 1877, just ten units created after 1874 received this design, at the Poiana army headquarters. On this occasion, Prince Carol addressed the following words to his troops: “In giving you the corps’ flag, I entrust the honor of Romania, which I thus place under the shield of courage, to your devotion and self-denial. For the first time the solemn occasion arises where you receive the flag on the day before going onto the field of honor; seek to crown it with an undying glory. Never forget that the flag is the symbol of the fatherland...”
These two categories of flags were replaced with new ones in 1902, on the 25th anniversary of the Romanian War of Independence.
Small details differentiate "flags produced between 1882 and 1897" from their predecessors. The canvas was square, 156 centimeter to a side; a ribbon of tricolored thread ending in tassels was attached to the flagpole. The lions holding up the coat of arms had gold teeth and claws this time, while the coat of arms was no longer bordered in maroon. In the middle of the shield, the coat of arms of the House of Hohenzollern was surrounded by a gold border.
These three generations were realized by the Romanian state at Berlin’s Collani et Comp house. In 1896, war minister Anton Berindei, observing that “the way in which flags are woven and the materials used leave something to be desired, as their canvas gets cut and breaks”, addressed an order to General Ioan Argetoianu, president of the joint commission and inspector general of the military engineers: “I have the honor of asking you to take measures so that the commission over which you preside can make a detailed description of the flags and standards in existence, on the materials from which they must be produced, dimensions, etc. In the work to be done the law of 8 March 1872 [...] which decided the national insignia and flag, will be kept in mind”.
Thus, beginning with the "1897 design flags", the ratio was 2:3, the entire national coat of arms appeared in the center (with modifications made after 1881), and the wreath that surrounded it was sometimes open.
Most of the flags belonging to divisions that took part in World War I were handed to them in 1902 or in 1908-1916, and were used until 1929 when they were transferred to the Military Museum. These are similar to the "1897 design", although after King Carol died on 10 October 1914, King Ferdinand’s monogram began appearing in the corners. Their dimensions vary from 90 × 65 centimeter to 115 × 73 centimeter.
Along with the military colors, through High decrees nr. 355 of February 1871 and nr. 1467 of 21 August 1873, designs for stakes were defined for each infantry corps, as well as battalion pennants. The latter substituted for military colors where necessary (each regiment had just a single flag), and were vertical tricolors, as provided by the 1867 and 1872 laws regarding Romania’s coats of arms.
A flag was also established for Romania’s Coast Guard. According to the October 1917 "National Geographic", this was identical to the national flag, except that the yellow stripe featured a blue anchor and cable, above which was a silver royal crown.
Also in this period there appeared laws and regulations providing how the military colors should be used, guarded and saluted. Thus, High decree nr. 1451 of 18 August 1873 specified that the flag should be carried by the regiment’s adjutant junior officer, aided by the flag-bearing officer. Likewise, the composition of the infantry’s flag guard was regulated. This was composed of five sergeants, of whom two in the first row, flanking the adjutant junior officer and having the assistant officer on the right, and three in the second row, behind the first. The “Regulation concerning infantry exercises and maneuvers” provided that during military maneuvers the flag (or pennant) should be in the center of the second battalion if the regiment was composed of three battalions or in the center of the first battalion if the regiment had only two. The flag-bearer, chosen by the colonel, was not integrated into any subdivision of the battalion. The same regulation listed in its index the honors due to the flag, as well as the manner of saluting with the flag, with the specification that this was reserved for the princely family.
Romanian flags in Transylvania, Banat, Bukovina and Bessarabia.
Transylvania, Banat, Bukovina and Bessarabia were provinces of the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires with substantial Romanian populations. In 1918, the year they joined Romania, favorable conditions arose for the Romanians there to express openly their desire to unite with the “Motherland”.
In Bessarabia, the Moldavian Democratic Republic was created on 2 December 1917 and declared independence on 24 January 1918. In May 1917, the heraldist Paul Gore had written a Russian-language study, “The National colors of the Romanians in Bessarabia”, which sought to demonstrate that Bessarabians should use the Romanian tricolor correctly: “A certain esteem for the national past and just a little courage are needed to defend your national legal rights. In no way do I insist that our national flag composed of three stripes colored blue, yellow and red have these stripes arranged vertically. Let these stripes, in the order indicated, be horizontal. But the colors and their order we must preserve, especially because all three of these colors are also in the Coat of Arms of Bessarabia, which represents, if we eliminate the border made up of the Imperial colors, precisely the ancient coat of arms of the Moldavian Principality, and it is known that flags must be designed according to the exact rules of heraldry, according to the colors of the field and the emblems of the corresponding coats of arms”.
With this perspective in mind, the heraldist Silviu Andrieş-Tabac considers Gore the moral author of the flag of the Moldavian Democratic Republic. This was a blue-yellow-red tricolor with horizontal stripes and the coat of arms in the center of the yellow field and the inscription “Republica Democratică Moldovenească şi Independentă” (“The Moldavian and Independent Democratic Republic”) in the center of the blue field. The flag of Sfatul Ţării was similar, except that “Sfatul Ţării” was written on the blue field and the coat of arms, with larger dimensions, was placed in the middle, over yellow and red.
The republic’s military colors were fashioned “several weeks before 6 December , when the parade of Moldavian troops from Bessarabia took place”. These were also tricolors; on one side was written the regiment’s number in silver thread, and on the other, stretching all across the flag, the letters “R M”.
In Transylvania, many Romanian flags were produced in anticipation of the Great National Assembly at Alba Iulia. These were horizontal blue-yellow-red tricolors, echoing the 1848 revolution. The images on glass captured at the Assembly by photographer Samoilă Mârza show a massive throng above whom flutter numerous such flags, some of the canvases inscribed with a motto.
The National Museum of Romanian History holds three flags from Assembly participants and the coat of arms of a fourth, which belonged to the Alba Iulia national guard. The first tricolor has dimensions of 235 × 100 centimeter, and each of its stripes ends on the fly in a corner with the tip turned outside. The wooden flagpole is painted black. On second tricolor, 130 × 75 centimeter, just the yellow and red stripes survive, and both end in a corner with the tip on the outside. The third flag is woolen and 190 × 120 centimeter. Its colored stripes all end in a sharp angle with the tip outside; to each one is sewn a tassel in the respective color. A tricolor ribbon with a tassel on either end is attached to the flagpole.
Flags of Greater Romania.
After Greater Romania came into being, the tricolor remained the official flag, with stripes arranged vertically and without a coat of arms in the center.
Royal standards.
On 24 April 1922 new designs for royal standards were adopted.
The king’s standard consisted of a red-maroon square flag, bordered by a yellow strip with blue triangles. There were thirteen blue triangles to a side, with an additional four in the corners. The country’s lesser coat of arms was found in the middle of the flag; beneath it was placed the cross of the Order of Michael the Brave. After ascending the throne in 1930, King Carol II stretched the cross to the edge of the standard, “as a symbol of heroic royalty”, and placed the lesser coat of arms above it. When his remains were returned to Romania in 2003, his coffin was draped in this standard.
The queen’s standard was similar to the king’s, but the cross was missing. The crown prince’s standard was dark blue, with a red border and yellow triangles; the lesser coat of arms was in the center. The royal princes’ flag was similar but lacked a border. In 1940, when Queen Helen returned to Romania, a flag was designed for the queen mother. This was similar to the queen’s standard but also lacked a border.

Flags and standards of public officials.
Contemporary vexilological albums (for instance the 1939 edition of "Flaggenbuch") display a number of flags and standards of interwar Romanian public officials. The war minister’s flag was a tricolor square with the letter “M” in white found on the blue stripe. The other ministers had similar flags but without the “M”. The jack employed by Romanian vessels was a yellow square bordered red with the coat of arms in the center. The ship captains’ standard was the national flag with a royal crown in the center. Pilot boats’ standard consisted of a national flag bordered in white. The flag’s ratio was 3:6 and the thickness of the border 2; altogether, it had a 10:13 ratio. River police had as their standard a blue square with a white “P” in the center. The standard of the postal division of the Romanian Maritime Service had a white field (ratio 4:5), with the fly ending in a sharp interior angle. A square national flag with the royal crown in the center appeared in the canton. A blue cord hung from the tricolor, catching a golden postal horn.
Military colors.
Military flags were tricolors with the national coat of arms painted in the center. In the corners were found the golden monograms of Kings Ferdinand I, Carol II (two designs) or Michael I, crowned and surrounded by a wreath of golden oak leaves. The flagpoles ended in a metal eagle with wings facing downward, crowned and carrying a cross in its beak.
Naval flags.
Admirals’ flags (including vice- and rear admirals’), shown in the 1939 "Flaggenbuch", were square Romanian tricolors. The Chief of the Naval General Staff had two white stars on the blue stripe of his flag and two crossed anchors; the three elements were one beneath the other. The vice admiral’s flag did not have the anchors, while the rear admiral’s standard had just one star on the blue stripe.
Naval captains and commanders had a longer red stripe on their standard, ending in an angle pointing inward; the ratio was about 11:13. Deputy commanders of ships had a tricolored triangle for their emblem, in a 2:3 ratio.
Naval flags of World War II.
Shortly before World War II, the flags of military vessels were changed. A specific design was adopted, the yellow portion taking the form of a cross with widened arms. The following models are shown in "Flaggenbuch", 1939:
Flags of the Romanian People’s Republic.
On 30 December 1947, Romania was proclaimed a people’s republic and all the kingdom’s symbols were outlawed, including the coats of arms and the tricolor flags that showed them. On 8 January 1948, Decree nr. 3 was issued, regarding specifications for the powers of the Presidium of the Romanian People’s Republic. At article 7, this provided that the republic’s new coat of arms should be “composed of: a tractor, a group of three chimneys against the field of a rising sun, surrounded by bound ears of wheat, tied by a ribbon with the inscription Republica Populară Română and the initials R. P. R. at the end of the ears”. Article 8 dealt with the national flag: “the colors of the Romanian People’s Republic are: blue, yellow and red, arranged vertically, and having in the center of the yellow field the Coat of Arms of the Republic”.
According to article 101 of the 1948 Constitution, “The flag of the Romanian People’s Republic is composed of the colors: blue, yellow and red, arranged vertically. In the middle is placed the national coat of arms”. The 1952 Constitution, at article 103, added a little detail: “The flag of the Romanian People’s Republic has the colors red, yellow and blue, arranged vertically with blue near the lance. In the middle is placed the coat of arms of the Romanian People’s Republic”. Neither the colors’ shades nor the flag’s proportions were specified. According to provisions of the 1952 Constitution, a five-pointed red star appeared at the upper edge of the coat of arms (itself altered in March 1948), something that was also reflected on flags and official Romanian standards.
Military colors; standards.
On 28 July 1950 the Great National Assembly issued Decree nr. 189 for the establishment of the military colors of the Armed Forces of the Romanian People’s Republic, as well as standards for the Military Air Force and the Naval Forces. Article 2 defined the units’ military colors as follows: “three silk stripes colored red, yellow and blue, arranged vertically with blue situated near the flagpole. On the edges the flag has yellow metal fringes of wire, while the fly corners each have a tassel of the same wire. On the side oriented from the flagpole to the right, in the middle, is placed the coat of arms of the R. P. R. in natural colors. Above the coat of arms, on the same side, in an arched line, is written with letters of golden wire: ‘Pentru Patria noastră’ (‘For our Fatherland’). On the other side and in the middle of the flag, the emblem worn on the uniforms of officers of the Armed Forces of the R. P. R. is applied. Under the emblem is written straight, with letters of golden wire, the unit’s name. The flagpole ends in an ogive-shaped tip, within which is found a five-pointed star, in the center of which are written the initials RPR”. The law’s annex also specified the dimensions of the flag (100 centimeter long by 60 centimeter wide), the coat of arms and the emblem (20 centimeter high), the fringes (5 centimeter long), the flagpole (250 centimeter long) and of the ogive (15 centimeter long by 7 centimeter wide).
Article 3 described the Air Force ensign: “it is made of sky-blue silk. The ensign is rectangular, with each face having applied to it 18 red silk strips in the form of sunrays. On the edges, the ensign has fringes and tassels the same as on the military colors. In the middle of the face oriented from the flagpole to the right is affixed the coat of arms of the R. P. R., while in the middle of the other face is affixed the emblem worn on the uniforms of officers belonging to the Armed Forces of the R. P. R. The coat of arms of the R. P. R., the emblem and the inscriptions are identical to those of the military colors”. The annex specified the dimensions of the ensign and the decorative elements, which were identical to those of the military colors. In the center of the flag, a ray had an angle of 10˚. Also specified was the shade of blue to be used on the flag: “iron blue”.
Article 4 described the Romanian Navy’s ensign thus: “made of two pieces of white and blue silk, rectangular, laid horizontally, the blue one, beneath, having a width of 20 centimeter, while the white one, above, having a width of 40 centimeter. The coat of arms of the R. P. R. is applied to the middle of the white surface on the face oriented from the flagpole to the right, while on the other face, also in the middle of the while surface, the emblem worn on the uniforms of officers belonging to the Armed Forces of the R. P. R. is applied. The coat of arms, the emblem, the inscriptions, the fringes and the tassels are the same as those of the military colors”. The annex specified the flag’s dimensions (also 100 × 60 centimeter) and those of the coat of arms (also 20 centimeter high), as well as its distance to the edges of the white strip (11 centimeter above and 9 centimeter below). The words “Pentru Patria noastră” (“For our Fatherland”) were found on the white strip above the coat of arms, while “Republica Populară Română” and the unit’s name were placed in the middle of the blue strip.
Decree nr. 190 of 1950, published in the same issue of "Buletinul Oficial", established the design of Army soldiers’, officers’ and generals’ emblems. The officers’ emblem was a five-pointed, red-enamelled star 34 centimeter in diameter. In the center were two circles: the first, with a radius of 15 centimeter, was enamelled yellow and touched the star’s interior angles, while the second, which had a radius of 11 centimeter, was enamelled blue and in the center had the golden initials “R. P. R.”
The following year, Decree nr. 124 of 20 July 1951 for the modification of art. 4 of Decree nr. 189 altered the Navy’s ensign. The new regulation provided for three separate insignia: the flag of Navy land units, the flag of Navy ships and the flag of Coast Guard ships.
The Navy’s land units had as their flag “two pieces of silk, colored white and blue, rectangular in shape, laid horizontally, the blue piece below, and the white one above. In the middle of the white area facing from the flagpole to the right is affixed the coat of arms of the Romanian People’s Republic, in natural colors, while on the other side, also in the middle of the white area, is affixed the symbol worn on the uniforms of officers belonging to the Armed Forces of the Romanian People’s Republic. The coat of arms, emblem, inscriptions, fringes and tassels are the same as those of the military colors described in article 2 Decree nr. 189 of 1950”. According to this decree’s annex, the flag’s dimensions were 100 × 60 centimeter, the blue strip being 20 centimeter wide and the white 40 centimeter, the coat of arms was 20 centimeter high and it was 11 centimeter away from the top edge of the white strip and 9 centimeter away from the bottom.
Navy ships had an ensign consisting of a “piece of ordinary rectangular canvas, with the colors white and blue printed on either side, in two stripes laid horizontally, the blue one below. The coat of arms of the Romanian People’s Republic, in natural colors, is affixed to the middle of the white area on both sides. The ensign does not have fringes or tassels is supplied with cords and a mechanism for raising it on the stern beam or the mast”. The ensign for Coast Guard ships was different from that of Navy ships only in the color of the lower stripe—Coast Guard green. The law’s annex described proportions for the ensign’s various elements; the actual dimensions were to be fixed by the Armed Forces Ministry and the Interior Ministry depending on the ship’s size and the place where the ensign was raised. Thus, the flag was 0.6 times as wide as it was long, being divided thus: colored stripe and white stripe. The coat of arms was to be the height of the flag’s width, being placed of this width away from the edges of the white stripe.
Between 1953 and 1964, due to a spelling reform, the country’s name was written on flags as "Romînia" and not "România".
Decree nr. 93 of 17 April 1954 for the modification of art. 4 of Decree nr. 189 established new vexillological devices: the ensign of auxiliary Navy ships (the previous ensign continuing in use only for battleships) and pennants for Navy battleships, auxiliary Navy ships and Coast Guard vessels.
The ensign of auxiliary Navy ships was made of an “ordinary canvas, rectangular and blue. In the upper corner on the side where it attaches to the cord, it has imprinted on both sides the colors white and light blue, in two horizontal stripes, the white one above. To the middle of the white area, on both sides, is affixed the coat of arms of the Romanian People’s Republic, in natural colors”. This ensign’s proportions were indicated in the annex. It was 0.6 times as wide as it was long: the upper left part of the standard was similar in proportion to the basic elements of the battleship standard, while its dimensions were 0.5 of the flag’s length and 0.3 of its width.
Navy and Coast Guard vessels had a masthead pennant made of an “ordinary rectangular canvas, red for Navy battleships, blue for auxiliary Navy ships and green for Coast Guard ships width is 0.6 of the length. At the edge near the cord, the colors white and light blue are imprinted on both sides, in two horizontal stripes, for Navy ships and white and light green on Coast Guard ships proportions of and respectively; this area’s length is 0.075 that of the pennant’s length. In both cases white shall be above. The coat of arms of the Romanian People’s Republic, in natural colors is affixed to the middle of the white area on both sides a height of the pennant’s width and located and of this width away from the edges of the white area. At the other end, the pennant is cut in the form of a sharp angle pointing inward cut was 1.2 times as deep as the length of the white and colored area near the cord. The ships’ pennany is provided with a cord and a mechanism for being raised on a tall mast”. The proportions of the pennant’s component elements were indicated in the annex, with the actual dimensions remaining to be decided by the Armed Forces Ministry and the Interior Ministry.
Flags of the Socialist Republic of Romania.
The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Romania, adopted in 1965, provided the following in article 118: “The flag of the Socialist Republic of Romania has the colors red, yellow and blue, arranged vertically, with blue near the flagpole. The coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Romania is affixed to the middle”.
Decree nr. 972 of 5 November 1968 regarding the insignia of the Socialist Republic of Romania (RSR) described in detail the coat of arms, seal, flag and state anthem of the republic. The attached commentary noted that, in the absence of corresponding regulations, “there have appeared mistaken interpretations of these specifications, incorrect or diverging usages of the state insignia”. Chapter IV of the decree is entirely devoted to describing the flag and the protocol for its use. Thus, the flag is defined as having a ratio of 2:3, with the colored stripes of equal dimensions. The regular colors were printed in the annex and not expressly named. The coat of arms was placed in the center; its height was the flag’s width. As before, it was provided that the flag’s proportions could differ for ornamental purposes, but the coat of arms must always be in the center, vertical. Articles 13-21 specifically and exhaustively covered flag protocol, describing where it was to be raised permanently and temporarily (art. 13), the protocol for raising it outside the country’s borders (art. 14) and during demonstrations by socialist organizations (art. 15), the conditions for lowering it to half-staff (art. 16, 17 and 18, with art. 20 describing exceptions to the rule), the conditions and manner for draping caskets with the flag (art. 19), as well as the place of the Romanian flag in case it flew besides one or more foreign flags (art. 21).
Flags of the President, Prime Minister and Minister of the Armed Forces.
The President of the RSR (until 1974 the President of the Council of State) and the prime minister had their own standard, a square Romanian tricolor with a white edge and a red border beyond that; the RSR’s coat of arms was in the center, the height of the tricolor’s width. The standard was decorated with fringes of golden thread and tassels of the same material. The flag of the Minister of the Armed Forces of the RSR consisted of a white pennant in a 1:2 ratio. The flag of the RSR was placed in the canton, while two red five-pointed stars occupied the fly.
Military colors and standards.
Military colors and standards adopted during the Romanian People’s Republic were modified or completely changed by Decree nr. 106 of 24 December 1966 regarding regulations for granting the military colors of units and large units from all military branches, modifying the display protocol for ensigns and pennants of navy and Coast Guard ships, establishing a distinctive emblem and commanders’ emblems for navy and Coast Guard vessels, a jack for navy ships and a distinctive ensign for Coast Guard ships.
In the attached commentary, it was mentioned that the previous regulations were no longer valid, primarily because:
Article 2 of the decree provided that “the military colors are granted by the Council of State of the Romanian Socialist Republic to units and large units from all military branches from the Armed Forces Ministry, as well as to units from the Internal Affairs Ministry, at their founding. The flag is granted, depending on the case, at the initiative of the armed forces minister or the internal affairs minister. The granting of the flag is done in the name of the Council of State of the Romanian Socialist Republic by a representative of the armed forces, respectively of the internal affairs minister”. The first clause of this article was modified thus by Decree nr. 150 of 19 June 1974 regarding the modification of certain laws and decrees: “the flag is granted by presidential decree to units and large units of all military branches from the Armed Forces Ministry, as well as to units from the Internal Affairs Ministry, at their founding”.
Ensigns of navy and Coast Guard vessels consisted of the military colors of the respective units.
The pennant was the device that indicated a ship was armed and commanded by a navy officer. It consisted of an “ordinary canvas, in the shape of an isosceles triangle, with the base toward the attaching mechanism and with the flag colors and coat of arms of the Romanian Socialist Republic printed on both sides”.
The jack was “an ordinary square canvas, having printed on both sides the flag colors and coat of arms of the Romanian Socialist Republic. Two crossed white anchors of the same size as the coat of arms are affixed to the blue area”.
The distinctive ensign of Coast Guard vessels consisted of “an ordinary white rectangular canvas, with the half near the attaching mechanism green, upon which is affixed a white anchor”.
The dimensions of these insignia, as well as their manner of use, were left to the Armed Forces Ministry to decide by regulation.
Decree nr. 90 of 27 April 1977 regarding the establishment of military colors for patriotic guards and the regulation of its granting created a special symbol for units of the Patriotic Guards. This was similar to military colors of military units, with the exception of the inscription on the flag’s reverse side — “Gărzile patriotice” — in an arched line above the coat of arms, and the administrative unit in which the formation was located (the municipality or county), in a straight line beneath the coat of arms. Its dimensions were indicated in the annex: the canvas was 100 centimeter long and 66 centimeter wide, the text was 6 centimeter high, the fringes 5 centimeter long, the flagpole 240 centimeter long and 4 centimeter wide, while the ogive at the end of the flagpole was 15 centimeter high. According to the Decree, the flag was granted to a unit by commanders of county-level or Bucharest-level Patriotic Guards, or by representatives of the General Staff of the Patriotic Guards from the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party, following a presidential decree for this purpose. Patriotic Guards that distinguished themselves in training exercises for national defense and that comprised at least 2000 fighters were eligible to receive flags.
Naval rank flags.
Decree nr. 1016 of 1966 created a legal framework for the establishment of distinctive rank flags and commanders’ rank flags, which were raised on Navy and Coast Guard ships, in accordance with the services’ sailing regulations.
A distinctive rank flag was raised when “the general secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party, the president of the Council of State of the Romanian Socialist Republic or the president of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian Socialist Republic on an official visit” aboard ship.
The commanders’ rank flag was flown in similar situations for: “the minister of the armed forces of the Romanian Socialist Republic, the commander of the navy, the commander of a large unit of ships of the commander of a group of ships temporarily constituted”.
The form, colors and dimensions of the flags remained to be fixed by regulation.
Flag of the Romanian Revolution of 1989.
Starting on 17 December 1989, during the revolution at Timişoara, the coat of arms of the Romanian Socialist Republic began to be removed from flags, being viewed as a symbol of Nicolae Ceauşescu’s dictatorial regime. Most often, this was accomplished by cutting or ripping out the middle of the yellow stripe, giving rise to the term "the flag with the hole".
Decree-Law nr. 2 of 27 December 1989 regarding the membership, organization and functioning of the Council of the National Salvation Front and of the territorial councils of the National Salvation Front provided at article 1, among other matters, that “the national flag is the traditional tricolor of Romania, with the colors laid out vertically, in the following order, starting from the flagpole: blue, yellow, red”.
Storage, restoration and conservation of old flags.
In the 19th century, after a modern army was established in the two Danubian Principalities, old military and princely flags were deposited at the Army Arsenal. In 1919 these were all transferred to the National Military Museum. Flags that witnessed the Romanian War of Independence were replaced in 1902 and kept until 1928-29 in the throne room of the Royal Palace, after which they entered the Military Museum’s collection. In 1971 a significant number of old flags was given to the National History Museum.
In 1966, there were 1075 Romanian and foreign flags at the Central Military Museum, of which 949 were original, including the flagpole, top decoration and canvas, 42 were copies and reconstructions, and for 84, just the flagpole and decoration remained. Together with other categories of flags, standards, ship flags, pennants, sashes and ties, the collection reached 1248 items. By the mid-2000s, the museum’s flag and standard collection counted 10,826 objects.
A majority of Romania’s older flags have a field that is either deteriorated (some are missing almost entirely) or slashed by bullets or swords.
Museum experts have taken steps to preserve flags, including: introducing and stitching a double tulle into the majority of flags (starting in the 1930s), washing certain dust-covered flags using special methods, placing dark protective covers over the flags to shield the fabric from light, replacing seriously deteriorated exemplars with copies, photographing flags in order to avoid repeated manipulation, and climate-controlling storage areas and exhibit halls. Certain flags are also subject to restoration work.
Acts of heroism under the flag.
During the Romanian War of Independence, Romanian troops were inspired to bravery by their flag’s presence. During an attack on 30 August 1877, Captain Nicolae Valter Mărăcineanu fell in action while inserting the 8th line Regiment’s flag into the parapet of the Griviţa redoubt. Troops from the 3rd cavalry Regiment were among the first to enter Pleven, wading through the Vit with the flag before them.
Following these acts of bravery, the military colors were decorated in a solemn ceremony on 8 October 1878. Units that participated in the Siege of Griviţa (6th line infantry Regiment, "dorobanţi" Regiments 6, 10, 13 and 14), that fought at Pleven (6th line infantry Regiment, "dorobanţi" Regiments 6 and 14, "vânători" Battalions 2 and 4, cavalry Regiments 3 and 7), and Smârdan and Vidin (6th line infantry Regiment, 3rd artillery Regiment) received the Danube Crossing Cross ("Crucea Trecerii Dunării"). The 13th "dorobanţi" Regiment also received the Order of the Star of Romania, along with three other regiments, while "vânători" Battalion 2 received the Great Cross of the Order of the Star of Romania. Among the others decorated were the 9th "dorobanţi" Regiment and the 4th and 6th line infantry Regiments. Moreover, on 23 September 1879 in Galaţi, the flag of the 6th line infantry Regiment received the Military Bravery medal from Prince Milan IV of Serbia.
World War I also saw sacrifices in defense of the military colors, as a symbol of the duty to defend the nation’s land and military honor. In October 1916, the flag guard of Neagoe Basarab infantry Regiment 83 met a cavalry patrol of the German Army. Although one of his arms was sliced off, the regimental flag-bearer stood his ground until his comrades jumped to his defense and saved the flag. A month later, the Dolj infantry Regiment 1 found itself in dire circumstances, deciding to bury the flag in a peasant’s yard in Izbiceni. It was recovered in autumn 1918 after the occupying foreign armies had been driven out. Coast Guard Regiment 1 also faced difficulty in fighting at the Olt Defile. Then, the unit commander decided to bury the eagle from atop the flag, while the canvas was wrapped around the body of a troop who snuck through the confusion. The flag was placed back on a pole in Moldavia and took part in the 1917 campaigns. At the end of the war, it was decorated with the Order of Michael the Brave, the Commemorative Cross of the War of 1916-1918 and the Victoria medal.
Many other military colors were decorated at war’s end. To name but a few examples, heavy artillery Regiment 1 received the Order of the Star of Romania (rank of knight with swords) and the ribbon of Military Virtue. Heavy artillery Regiment 4 was decorated with the Order of the Star of Romania and the Commemorative Cross of the War of 1916-1918. The Mircea Regiment 32 received the Order of Michael the Brave. Infantry Regiment 70, “giving proof of the noblest spirit of sacrifice and a powerful patriotism”, received the Order of Michael the Brave Class III and the Commemorative Cross 1916-1918.
During World War II, units’ flags that appeared in battle were also decorated. In action on the Western Front, ant-aircraft artillery Regiment 6 and "vânători" Regiment 2 were decorated with the Order of Aeronautic Virtue with swords. Among the units that received the Order of Michael the Brave with swords were cavalry Regiment 2, which distinguished itself in battles on the Someş and Mureş rivers and in Czechoslovakia, infantry Regiment 96, which broke through the Tisza and liberated Budapest, Regiments 18 artillery and 34 infantry, and Battalions 7 and 8 "vânători de munte".

Student debt

Student debt is a form of debt that is owed by an attending, withdrawn or graduated student to a lending institution. The lending is often of a student loan, but debts may be owed to the school if the student has dropped classes and withdrawn from the school. Withdrawing from a school, especially if a low- or no-income student has withdrawn with a failing grade, could deprive the student of the ability of further attendance by disqualifying the student of necessary financial aid). Student loans also differ in many countries in the strict laws regulating renegotiating and bankruptcy. Due payments may be a retroactive penalty for services rendered by the school to the individual, including room and board.
As with most other types of debt, student debt may be considered defaulted after a given period of non-response to requests by the school and/or the lender for information, payment or negotiation. At that point, the debt is turned over to a Student Loan Guarantor or a collection agency.
History.
Many factors are accountable for the drastic increase of student debt. The growing problem of student debt has become more prominent in the past decade, inspiring numerous documentaries that examine the causes and effects. "The Fallen American Dream", is a documentary on America’s challenges with college affordability and its declining job market during a time of national crisis and global change. One factor is due to the new guidelines developed by the federal government. There are now new rules deciding who can borrow, as well as how much debt they can take on. Colleges and universities have been increasing the costs for students to attend their respective schools subsequently increasing the amount of debt these students take on as student loans. Reports have shown that borrowers who finished college in the early 1990s were able to maintain managing their student loans without an enormous burden. The average debt has increased 58% since over the past seven years. It has risen from $17,233 in 2005 to $27,253 in the United States. Some blame the economy for the debt increases, but in the same 7 year period credit card debt and auto debt have decreased. According to the Student Debt Crisis, within the past three decades the cost of attaining a college degree has drastically increased by more than 1,000 percent. If student debt had stayed constant with inflation since 1992, graduates would not be facing such burdens by student loans.
Statistics.
United States.
""With $864 billion in federal loans and $150 billion in private loans, student debt in America now exceeds $1 trillion.""
There are around 37 million student loan borrowers with outstanding student loans today. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, outstanding student loan debt in the United States lies between $902 Billion and $1 Trillion with around $864 Billion in Federal student loan debt. As of Quarter 1 in 2012, the average student loan balance for all age groups is $24,301. About one-quarter of borrowers owe more than $28,000; 10% of borrowers owe more than $54,000; 3% owe more than $100,000; and less than 1%, or 167,000 people, owe more than $200,000. Of the 37 million borrowers who have outstanding student loan balances, 14%, or about 5.4 million borrowers, have at least one past due student loan account. It is also interesting to note that for every student loan borrower who defaults, at least two more borrowers become delinquent without default. In 2010 for the first time ever, student loan debt exceeded credit card debt and in 2011 student debt surpassed auto loans. According to Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of FinAid.org, student loan debt is growing by $3,000 per second.
Canada.
Canadians have been experiencing the rapid accumulation of student loans as well. As of September 2012, the average debt for a Canadian leaving college was $28,000, and that accumulated debt takes an average of 14 years to fully repay. As a nation, Canadians have accumulated more than $15 Billion dollars of student loan debt, while Canadians continue to fight to protect their tuition rates from further skyrocketing.
Student reactions.
The growing problem of student debt has caused many reactions from young people throughout the United States. As a result, the Occupy Colleges and Occupy Student Debt movements merged in 2012 in an effort to gain support from students around the country. There have been significant efforts made via social media for the Occupy Student Debt campaign. In particular, students all over the United States have posted their personal student debt testimonies. Since last October, Occupy Student Debt has provided a platform for over 800 students to share their horror stories. Because of this, other organizations such as, Rebuild the Dream, Education Trust, and the Young Invincibles, have joined in the effort and started similar platforms. The Occupy College movement itself has staged over 10 direct actions. They have also gathered over 31,000 signatures on the White House’s petition site, “We the People”. As a result, President Obama announced the Pay as you Earn initiative. Another petition, titled 'Support the Student Loan Forgiveness Act of 2012' on MoveOn.org, which seeks similar relief for student borrowers, has gotten over one million signatures. HR 4170: “The Student Loan Forgiveness Act of 2012” would give relief to borrowers with both federal and private student loans. HR 4170 also includes the “10-10” programs, which allows borrowers to pay 10% of their discretionary income for ten years with the remaining balance forgiven afterwards.

Bobo people

The Bobo are an ethnic group living in Burkina Faso although the area occupied by the Bobo extends north into Mali. In much of the literature on African art the group that lives in the area of Bobo-Dioulasso is called Bobo-Fing, literally 'black Bobo.' These people call themselves Bobo and they speak the Bobo language, a Mande language. The Bamana (Bambara) people also call another ethnic group "Bobo," the Bobo-Oule/Wule, more precisely called the Bwa. While the Bwa (Bobo-Oule) are a Gur people, speaking Gur languages, the true Bobo (Bobo Madare, Bobo Fing), the topic of this article, are a Mande people. The Bobo number about 110,000 people, with the great majority in Burkina Faso. The major Bobo community in the south is Bobo-Dioulasso, the second city of Burkina Faso and the old French colonial capital. Farther north are large towns, including Fo and Kouka, with Boura in the extreme north in Mali. The Bobo are far from homogeneous. They are an ancient aggregation of several peoples who have assembled around a number of core clans that do not preserve any oral traditions of immigration into the area. Their language and culture are more closely related to those of their Mandé neighbors to the north and west, the Bamana (as well as the Minianka, also known as Mamara Senoufo, and a Gur people) than to their Voltaic neighbors the Gurunsi and Mossi, but they should be thought of as a southern extension of the Mandé people who live in what is now Burkina Faso, rather than an intrusive Mandé group that has recently penetrated the region. Although over 41% of Bobo lineages claim a foreign origin, they also say that they are autochthonous.
History.
The Bobo have lived in the region for centuries, with some estimates dating back to 800 A.D. It is generally believed that they moved into this area from the north. One of the primary reasons for this thinking is that they speak a language considered to be part of the Mandé family, which originates to the north in Mali. Throughout the history of the region, other peoples, like the Zara, have also moved into the area, influencing the Bobo and sometimes being either partially or wholly absorbed into Bobo agricultural society.
Economy.
Farming among the Bobo is of primary importance. Agricultural activity is not merely a way of providing for subsistence among the Bobo, it is the essential component of their day-to-day existence. The major food crops are red sorghum, pearl millet, yams, and maize. They also cultivate cotton, which is sold to textile mills in Koudougou. The imposition of colonial rule and the construction of these mills led to the disintegration of the local cooperative labor systems, which had served to bond the members of Bobo society together.
Political System.
The Bobo lineage is the fundamental social building-block. The Bobo are an inherently decentralized group of people. The concept of placing political power in the hands of an individual is foreign to the Bobo. Each village is organized according to the relationship among individual patriline. The lineage unites all descendants of a common ancestor, called the "wakoma", a word whose stem, wa-, is a contraction of the Bobo word for house "wasa". The Bobo lineage comprises the people who live in a common house. The head of a lineage is called the wakoma or father of the lineage. He may also be called the sapro, which is the term for ancestors. As among other peoples in Burkina, each clan has a totem, so that when a Bobo introduces himself he gives his given name, then his clan name, followed by the totem that he respects.
Religion.
The creator god is called Wuro. He cannot be described and is not represented by sculptures. Bobo cosmogonist myth describe the creation of the world by Wuro and the ordering of his creations. He is responsible for the ordering of all things in the world into opposing pairs: man/spirits, male/female, village/bush, culture/nature and so on.
The balances between forces as they were created by Wuro are precarious, and it is easy for men to throw the forces out of balance. Farming, for instance, can unbalance the precarious equilibrium between culture/nature and village/bush when the crops are gathered in the bush and brought into the village.
For the Bobo people there are two important epochs. The time of Wuro, when the universe was created and the historical time, when Wuro gave man his son Dwo.

Linda Greenlaw

Linda Greenlaw (born December 22, 1960) is a best-selling author of books with maritime themes and the only female swordfishing boat captain on the East Coast of the United States. She was featured in the 1997 book "The Perfect Storm" and the 2000 film adaptation. Linda Greenlaw now captains the boat "Hannah Boden" on the Discovery Channel show "". She previously captained "Seahawk" after the previous captain died on board.
Greenlaw wrote three best-selling books about life as a commercial fisher: "The Hungry Ocean" in 1999, "The Lobster Chronicles" in 2002 and "All Fishermen Are Liars" in 2002.
Her books have climbed as high as No. 2 on the "New York Times" bestseller list, with "The Hungry Ocean" remaining on the list for three months.
Greenlaw lives on Isle au Haut, Maine, and was the first female sword-fishing boat captain on the American East Coast.
Early years.
Greenlaw was born in Connecticut, the daughter of Jim and Martha Greenlaw. Her father was an information systems manager for Bath Iron Works. She was raised in Topsham, Maine, and her family spent their summers in Isle au Haut, a village of 70 people off the coast of Maine. Greenlaw attended Colby College, where she majored in both English and government. To help pay her way through college, Linda worked as a cook and deckhand aboard the sword-fishing boat "Walter Leeman" during her summers. She continued working on the boat during free time and vacations and, after her graduation in 1983, continued working for the boat's owner, Alden Leeman, who installed Greenlaw as a swordfish captain in 1986 when he acquired a second vessel.
Greenlaw wrote in "The Hungry Ocean": "Being a woman hasn't been a big deal. I never anticipated problems stemming from being female, and never encountered any. I have been surprised, even embarrassed, by the number of people who are genuinely amazed that a woman might be capable of running a fishing boat."
Commercial fisherman.
Greenlaw was the captain of the "Hannah Boden" in October 1991 when "Andrea Gail" sank in the Atlantic in the 1991 Perfect Storm. Greenlaw's efforts to warn the "Andrea Gail" about the impending storm were portrayed in Sebastian Junger's 1997 book "The Perfect Storm" and in the movie version, in which she was played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Junger called Greenlaw not just the only female swordfishing captain, but "one of the best captains, period, on the entire East Coast."
In 1997, Greenlaw settled in Isle au Haut, and bought a lobster boat, the 35-foot "Mattie Belle".
On May 28, 2009, Greenlaw was convicted of illegally entering and illegally fishing in Canadian waters by the Newfoundland Provincial Court. The Crown asked for a fine of CAD$53,000, while the defense recommended a fine of half that amount. She was fined $38,000 after the judge found she did not use "due diligence".
Writer.
Greenlaw's first book, "The Hungry Ocean" (1999), described a one-month swordfishing voyage, entailing, "among other things, treacherous weather, uncooperative fish, wildly entertaining shipmates, and the exhausting, mind-bending pressure of ten consecutive 21-hour days." Subsequent books include "The Lobster Chronicles: Life on a Very Small Island" (2002), "All Fishermen Are Liars: True Tales from the Dry Dock Bar" (2004), "Seaworthy: A Swordboat Captain Returns to the Sea" (2010), and "Lifesaving Lessons: Notes from an Accidental Mother" (2013). Greenlaw has co-authored two cookbooks with her mother, Martha Greenlaw, and published two novels of detective fiction—"Slipknot" (2007) and "Fisherman's Bend" (2008)—featuring her fictional detective Jane Bunker.
Awards.
Greenlaw was the winner of the American Library Association's Alex Award in 2000, United States Maritime Literature Award in 2003, and the New England Book Award for nonfiction in 2004.

New York State Route 267

New York State Route 267 (NY 267) was an east–west state highway in the western portion of New York in the United States. It extended for from an intersection with NY 93 in the Erie County village of Akron to a junction with NY 77 in the Genesee County hamlet of Basom. Part of NY 267 in Genesee County passed through the Tonawanda Indian Reservation. The portion of NY 267 within Erie County was assigned . NY 267 was extended east to NY 77 in Basom in the late 1930s, replacing New York State Route 77A, a spur leading from NY 77 to the eastern edge of the Tonawanda Reservation. The Erie County segment of the route was transferred from the state of New York to Erie County in April 1980, leading to the total removal of the NY 267 designation in August of that year.
Route description.
NY 267 began at an intersection with NY 93 in the village of Akron in eastern Erie County. The route headed eastward, following John Street through downtown Akron. NY 267 broke from John Street just four blocks later. While the street continued east to serve Akron Airport, the route turned northeast to follow Bloomingdale Road out of the village. The route continued through gradually less developed areas of the town of Newstead, intersecting with County Route 250 (CR 250, named Scotland Road). NY 267 crossed into Genesee County soon afterward.
In the Genesee County town of Alabama, NY 267 made a slight turn to the north as it entered the Tonawanda Indian Reservation. Once inside the reservation, the route remained on a north-northeasterly alignment for about to a junction with Parker Road. At this point, the highway turned to the east, progressing across the reservation. At an intersection with Reuben Road later, NY 267 turned to the north for another before it exited the reservation. The route continued for roughly to the hamlet of Basom, where it terminated at an intersection with NY 77.
History.
NY 267 was assigned to a routing extending from NY 93 in Akron to the Erie–Genesee county line by way of John Street and Bloomingdale Road. Farther east, the portion of Bloomingdale Road between the Tonawanda Indian Reservation and NY 77 was designated as NY 77A around the same time. NY 77A and the remainder of Bloomingdale Road within Genesee County became an extension of NY 267 in the late 1930s. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of the portion of NY 267 within Erie County—by this point the lone state-maintained portion of the route—was transferred from the state of New York to Erie County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The NY 267 designation was removed from the entirety of its routing just over four months later on August 14, 1980. The Erie County segment of the route is now CR 573 while the Genesee County section is locally maintained.

Avenue (band)

Avenue were an English boy band. They participated in the third series of "The X Factor" in 2006 and initially made it to the final 12, but were banned from participation for having been specifically formed for the competition and having professional representation. They continued to proclaim their innocence.
After leaving "The X Factor", they stayed together and had brief success with the single "Last Goodbye", which reached the UK top 50. After the split, Max George went on to become a member of the British-Irish boyband The Wanted, who have since gone on to become one of the world's biggest boy bands, releasing a number of top 5 hits, two official UK number ones, and three top 10 albums. Jamie Tinkler left to form the indie band Baxter, and his replacement in Avenue, Andy Brown, went on to be the lead singer of Lawson, who have released five top 5 singles.
History.
2005–06: Beginnings.
Max George was born in 1988 grew up with his family in Manchester Before music, he had been a football player with Preston North End and on the verge of signing a two-year deal with them. But because of an accident he had dropped his sport dreams to join Avenue and apply for auditions in The X Factor. After the unfortunate break up of the band he joined the successful chart topping boy band The Wanted. George was engaged to actress Michelle Keegan, but called off the engagement. Despite the calling off of their engagement, the couple remained together for some time. However, they have now split up due to rumours spreading about Max cheating.
2006–07: "The X Factor".
In 2006, Avenue auditioned for the third series of "The X Factor", singing an a cappella version of "Leave Right Now", a song by Will Young. They made it through to bootcamp and judges' houses, and were mentored by Louis Walsh. Avenue made it to the Final 12 contestants heading for the live shows but after Walsh discovered that Avenue were already on a management deal, he disqualified them from the competition and Eton Road went through in their place.
2007–09: After "The X Factor".
After disqualification from "The X Factor", Avenue were signed by Crown Music Management and won an album deal with Island Records. There was also a membership change with Jamie Tinkler leaving and being replaced by Andy Brown, after Tinkler decided to join the indie rock band Baxter. 
Avenue released their debut single "Last Goodbye", which reached number 50 on the UK Singles Chart. The song features on the compilation albums "Floorfillers Clubmix", "Dance Mania Party" and Pop Party 6. During 2008, Avenue supported fellow McFly on their Radio:active Tour and a February 2009 tour was planned, but later cancelled.
Their follow up single was going to be "Can You Feel It?", but a commercial release was cancelled and it was distributed free on music service 7digital. In 2008, while still a member of Avenue, Max George appeared nude on cover of British magazine AXM in support of cancer research in AXM's "Naked Issue".
The band split up in April 2009 Max George is now in The Wanted and Andy Brown fronts his own band, Lawson.

Hermes and the Infant Dionysus

Hermes and the Infant Dionysos, also known as the Hermes of Praxiteles or the Hermes of Olympus is an ancient Greek sculpture of Hermes and the infant Dionysus discovered in 1877 in the ruins of the Temple of Hera at Olympia. It is displayed at the Archaeological Museum of Olympia.
It is traditionally attributed to Praxiteles and dated to the 4th century BC, based on a remark by the 2nd century Greek traveller Pausanias, and has made a major contribution to the definition of Praxitelean style. Its attribution is, however, the object of fierce controversy among art historians.
The sculpture is unlikely to have been one of Praxiteles' famous works, as no ancient replicas of it have been identified. The documentary evidence associating the work with Praxiteles is based on a passing mention by the 2nd-century AD traveller Pausanias.
Rediscovery.
In 1874, the Greek state signed an agreement with Germany for an archaeological exploration of the Olympia site, which was first dug in the French Morea expedition of 1829. The German excavations in 1875 were led by Ernst Curtius. On 8 May 1877, in the temple of Hera, he uncovered the body (head, torso, legs, left arm) of a statue of a young man resting against a tree trunk covered by a mantle. Protected by the thick clay layer above it, it was in an exceptionally good state of preservation.
It took six more separate discoveries to uncover the rest of the statue as it is displayed today. Hermes is still missing his right forearm, two fingers of his left hand, both forearms below the elbow, the left foot and his penis, whilst Dionysus is missing his arms (except the right hand on Hermes's shoulder) and the end of his right foot. Much of the tree trunk and the plinth are also lost. However, an ancient base survives, made of a grey limestone block between two blocks of marble.
Technical considerations.
The group is sculpted from a block of the best quality of Parian marble. Hermes measures 2.10/2.12 m, 3.70 m with the base. The right foot of Hermes is integral with a section of the base, which has undergone some adjustment in antiquity.
The face and torso of Hermes are striking for their highly polished, glowing surface, which John Boardman half-jokingly attributed to generations of female temple workers. The back, by contrast, shows the marks of the rasp and chisel, and the rest of the sculpture is incompletely finished. 
At the time of its discovery, the hair retained slight traces of cinnabar, a form of mercury sulfate with a red color, perhaps a preparation for gilding. Cinnabar tints are retained on the sandal straps of the original foot, with traces of gilding. The sandal also bears the motif of a Heraclean knot, which was probably extended in paint.
Identification.
Attribution.
Ce faisceau d'éléments a conduit à proposer d'autres attributions que celle de Praxitèle. L’"Hermès" pourrait être l'œuvre d'un sculpteur hellénistique, voire romain. L'attribution praxitélienne serait alors due à une erreur ou une confusion de Pausanias. Carl Blümel propose une solution qui permet de concilier témoignage de Pausanias et attribution tardive : pour lui, l’"Hermès" est bien l'œuvre d' « un » Praxitèle, mais il s'agirait en fait d'un sculpteur du dont la signature a été retrouvée dans les fouilles de Pergame. L'œuvre actuelle pourrait également être une copie d'une œuvre de Praxitèle : les proportions non-réalistes de l'enfant Dionysos, l'exécution jugée faible de la tête d'Hermès en seraient le signe.

Jagan Nath Kaul

Jagan Nath Kaul (October 13, 1924 – December 16, 2008) was the founder, president, and patron of SOS Children’s Village of India (SOS CVI). SOS CVI provides a home to almost 15,000 children in 34 children’s villages, located in various parts of the country. In addition to the children’s villages, SOS provides indirect care to children through its 122 allied projects such as kindergartens, schools and social, medical and vocational training centres throughout India. SOS CVI provides direct and indirect care to almost 2 lakh (200,000) children in the country.
Early life.
Jagan Nath Kaul was born in Srinagar, and his early schooling was in Kashmir. His education continued at the Universities of the Punjab, Rajasthan and Delhi. After completing his master's degree in economics Kaul began his professional career with the city of Delhi, rising to the positions of chief of probation services and assistant director of social welfare. In 1962 he received a Fulbright scholarship, and traveled to the USA for advanced studies in child and youth care at Case Western Reserve University. In 1963 Kaul met Hermann Gmeiner (who was visiting India), and went on to establish SOS Children's Villages of India with the support of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
SOS Children's Village.
The 1963 meeting between Kaul and Gmeiner (who was visiting India to establish SOS Children’s Villages there) was a meeting of the minds. Kaul identified completely with the SOS concept, and agreed to return to India and attempt to set up SOS Children’s Villages there. He dedicated the rest of his life to caring for children, starting a movement when he established the first SOS Children's Village at Greenfields in Faridabad in 1968 with the active support of then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The first SOS Children's Village in India Greenfields cared for over 200 children. After that, Kaul's mission was to bring succour to any child suffering due to man-made tragedies or natural disasters.
Kaul was village director of SOS Children’s Village Greenfields from its beginning. He hoped to reach out to as many children in India as possible and to establish at least one SOS Children’s Village in every province. As of 2011 India has 31 SOS Children's Villages, and 75 other projects. Kaul succeeded in involving thousands of Indians in fulfilling their social responsibilities towards children. A believer in partnership between government and the people, he did not hesitate to demand and stand up for the rights of children. 
Kaul served SOS Children’s Villages of India in various capacities, first as a village director and rising in position and responsibility as the organisation grew to the position of Secretary-General. From 1989 to July 2007, he was honorary president and patron of the national association. He also served two terms as Senator for SOS-Kinderdorf International. While Kaul received numerous awards for his efforts and commitment to the children of India (and is possibly the most-decorated social worker in India), his favorite reward was being lovingly called "Papaji" (revered father) by all in the SOS family. 
Kaul succeeded in involving thousands of Indians in contributing to the cause of child protection, maintaining: "When we give a child a home, we are expressing our belief in life and the fundamental good in people". He was associated with various government and voluntary agencies involved in child care, in various capacities:

Fragplan

A FRAGPLAN (Fragmentary Plan) or a "planning fragment" is a document that contains a plan for an activity or series of activities. The difference between a FRAGPLAN and a standard planning document is that rather than being a complete, holistic, end-to-end plan it is instead a pluggable, planning component which may then be assembled with other fragments to rapidly construct a complete plan. An organization may create a series of FRAGPLANs which cover different alternatives as a part of developing a planning library. People within the organization may then have readily at hand planning components when an event requiring quick response involving several parts of the organization must be responded to.
The use of FRAGPLANs are a standard part of military organizations. For instance FRAGPLANs were used as part of the execution of the movement from Europe to the Middle East of the US Army VII Corps in the first Gulf War. VII Corps had FRAGPLANs for movement of VII Corp assets to various European ports for embarkation on to ships and these FRAGPLANs were used as part of the total plan of moving VII Corps from its European locations to the Middle East.
The US Army describes a FRAGPLAN as planning "branches and sequels". A branch is a contingency plan or "options built into the basic plan" whereas a sequel is "subsequent operations based on the possible outcomes of the current operation".

Ruthmere Mansion

The Ruthmere Mansion (formerly the Albert and Elizabeth Beardsley Residence) is a three-story Beaux Arts mansion that is the most prominent historic residence in Elkhart, Indiana, United States. Built in 1910 and refurbished in the early 1970s, the Ruthmere Mansion is now open to the public as a museum.
Ruthmere is located along the St. Joseph River in Elkhart. The architect was Enoch Hill Turnock, commissioned by Albert and Elizabeth Beardsley in 1908. The Beardsleys named the mansion in memory of their only child, Ruth, who died at seven months. ("Mere" reflects the Latin root "maris" and refers to the home's proximity to water.) The mansion was a place of business, family, political and social gatherings until the deaths of the Beardsleys in 1924. Robert Beardsley of The Beardsley Foundation purchased the mansion in 1967 with the main goal of restoring it to its original beauty in order to create a museum for the community. Restoration took place between 1969 and 1973 when the mansion was made available to the public. The property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, and the Beardsley Avenue Historic District was established several years later.
Architectural design and decor.
Turnock designed the house in the Beaux Arts architectural style with Prairie School accents. The buff colored Belden brick used on the exterior came from Ohio and the limestone was from Bedford, Indiana. The many carved quoins on the outside of the mansion were in the shape of pomegranates, which connoted wealth and prosperity. The covered entrance is supported by square brick pillars crested with the letter “B” etched in the stone to represent the Beardsley family.
When entering the mansion, visitors are greeted with heat blowing from vents located along each step of the main stairwell to provide warmth. French doors open up to the balustrade marble piazza and a protective cover greet guests as they arrive. This main hallway area was used for music and entertainment, with the key point of interest being the Choralcelo, a combination piano player and organ. When it is playing, the piano can be heard in the foyer but the organ is heard in the library. The organ pipes were installed in the basement and played through ducts located in the library. The sound resonates throughout the hallway and plays music of the era in which the Beardsleys lived.
On the main level are the French drawing room, the library, and the dining room with an adjacent butler’s pantry. The drawing room was a formal room where guests were greeted. There is a hand-painted mural, "Aurora Greets the Dawn", on the ceiling by Albert Stoyer of Detroit. Above the fireplace is a large mahogany pomegranate, and book-matched Cuban mahogany is featured above the mantel.
The library is a less formal room but has the largest pomegranate above the marble fireplace which, like all the other fireplaces in the house, burned wood instead of gas. Due to the wood-burning fireplace, this was the only room that had a sprinkler system (which was removed in 1967 when the fireplace became disabled). The ceiling is decorated with the initials of the four generations of the Beardsley men: Albert, Arthur, Walter and Robert.
The dining room also has a fireplace and a Louis Comfort Tiffany "Oriental Poppies" chandelier over the dining table. The room has a full width pocket sliding door with a glass window to allow privacy for the diners while allowed servants in the hallway to keep an eye on the progress of the meal and courses. A floor buzzer was also available for the hosts to use to summon servants for assistance during meals. Original pieces of silverware and china that belonged to the family are on display in the built-in china cabinet. These pieces matched the décor of the home and established the family's elegant style. Off to the side of the dining room is the butler’s pantry where meals were prepared and kept warm in cabinets that had heating vents. This room is between the dining room and the actual kitchen and has a metal door to help prevent fire from spreading into the dining room. A 12-inch masonry wall was also built into the home between the dining room and the butler's pantry to prevent fire from spreading into the formal part of the home.
In the basement is a game room, which is currently used to hold small weddings. The game room was used for entertainment where guests played poker and pinochle. Originally the room had several tables with seating for four where these games were played. The stained glass windows that line the top of the east wall are replications of postcards from Italy, a place the Beardsleys visited on many occasions. The windows provided natural light for the game room. The top halves of the walls in the room are covered in original red velvet while the bottom halves are covered in materials that looked like leather. Along the walls are glass light sconces that light the room. The entire home was wired for electricity, which was rare in those days. For music, the game room had organ music piped into it through a grille that played from the Choralcelo upstairs in the foyer, along with a baby piano that stood in the corner.
The basement was connected to the rest of the mansion by a sophisticated call button service that allowed the family to summon their servants as needed. A hallway leads out of the game room into the conservatory, where Elizabeth was an enthusiastic gardener. The hallway has painted murals along the sides that have been preserved over the years.
The bedrooms are on the second level of the mansion. On the stairwell leading from the main floor to this level are three windows in the Prairie School Design which did not follow the pattern of the rest of the home. In the hallway are a doll collection, a grandfather clock and art hanging on the walls and stairwell, including "The Lost Profile" by William Morris Hunt, a portrait of the painters' wife, and a self-portrait by Samuel F. B. Morse. An important original limestone sculpture by Rodin, "The Fallen Caryatid", as well as a bronze, stand in the stair hall. Elizabeth's closet is also off the hallway and still contains clothing and shoes from that era. The ceiling has an elaborate stained glass skylight. This window provided natural light as there was another glass window above it on the third floor. The second floor was equipped with a central vacuum system for the housekeeping staff to use and had a trunk elevator that came up from the main floor.
As was the custom during that generation, husband and wife kept separate bedrooms. The north bedroom was Albert's room. This room has gold silk wall coverings, hand-stenciled ceilings, and an elaborate fireplace with a grate above it which aided in the air/heat circulation within the room. The closet has automatic lighting which turns on when the door is opened and a wall safe. In between Albert’s and Elizabeth’s room is a shared bathroom which was designed specifically for their use with a tub and shower facilities. The shower is a needle and shower bath, which is multi-directional and has a semicircular metal rib cage inside of it with little holes throughout the bars allowing the bather to have water showering on them at all times. There is a marble ledge around the room that has hand-stenciled paintings on it.
On the south is Elizabeth’s room, which is decorated in pink, her favorite color. This room was designed with a Victorian look with silk wall coverings. The ceiling has a delicate hand-painted design and the pink marble fireplace has very elaborate trim work. Along with the closet in the hallway, Elizabeth also had a narrow walk-in closet in the bedroom for easier access.
Across the hall from the Beardsley bedrooms are the third (guest) bedroom and the morning room. The guest room itself did not have a fireplace, but there is one in the attached private bathroom. There is a window in this room which is used to add symmetry to the exterior of the home. The bedroom features a twining rose design painted on the ceiling and a private closet. The morning room was used to plan the events of the day while having coffee or tea. This room has a plain white ceiling but is sufficiently decorated by the elaborate chandelier. It has its own fireplace and a beautiful view of the St. Joseph River. Hanging on the wall in this room is a portrait of Ruth Beardsley, the daughter of Albert and Elizabeth, who died at seven months of age due to complications with water on the brain (i.e., hydrocephalus). The picture has a black frame surrounding it which indicates that it is a mourning piece.
The third level of the house was mainly used for sitting purposes, as the narrow room has a very low ceiling, and was never used as a ballroom. Very rarely did guests and visitors enter the third floor.
Exterior design.
Outside the house are the courtyard and garage. The garage holds three cars of the era and originally housed the chauffeur upstairs. The upstairs is now a non-circulating library containing 1,800 volumes and periodicals on American domestic and landscape architecture and 19th and 20th century decorative arts. On the floor of the garage was a circular platform, or a turntable, that allowed the chauffeur to pull the car in, and turn it around using the platform so that it was ready to drive out.
Facts.
The family moved into the home in 1910 and lived there until 1924, when Albert and Elizabeth died within a few months of each other. Their nephew, Arthur L. Beardsley, lived in the home with his family from 1924 to 1944, and the S.S. Deputy family were the last occupants from 1945 until 1967, when The Beardsley Foundation purchased it and restoration began to make it a museum.

Hotel Yeşil Ev

The Hotel Yeşil Ev (literally: Hotel Green House) is a historic wooden mansion, located in the Sultanahmet neighborhood of Istanbul, Turkey, which is used as a hotel after restoration. The premise is run by the Touring and Automobile Club of Turkey (TTOK).
History.
Towards to the end of the 19th century, the four-storey wooden mansion was built for Şükrü Bey, minister of monopoly in the Ottoman government. After the death of the owner, the great house gradually fell into a state of neglect. In 1977, the mansion up for sale, was purchased by the TTOK.
The old wooden building had to be demolished and rebuilt with the consent of the "Commission for Ancient Monuments", since it was so far beyond repair. The exterior of the house was remade as an exact replica, while the layout with nineteen rooms was carefully preserved.
The restoration works, initiated by Çelik Gülersoy, the CEO of the TTOK, accomplished by March 1984, and the unique building opened as a hotel named "Yeşil Ev" after its exterior color. Combining historical style with modern standards, it very quickly gained a worldwide reputation and was awarded in 1985 the medal for the year by "Europa Nostra".
Hotel.
Situated between Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque, the hotel has an absolutely unrivaled location, and offers guests the warm and friendly atmosphere of an old Istanbul home.
All of the 18 rooms and one suite are furnished in the style of a 19th-century winter mansion. With a Turkish bath and its special decoration the Pasha Room of Yesil Ev has a world–wide reputation.
During the winter time, the indoor restaurant in the lobby with its 19th-century style decoration can serve 80 guests. The hotel's garden full of colorful flowers, high trees and a charming pool is capable of 200 people in the summer months.

<doc id="20596179" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20596179" title="Fuligo septica">
Fuligo septica

Fuligo septica is a species of plasmodial slime mold, and a member of the Myxomycetes class. It is commonly known as the dog vomit slime mold or scrambled egg slime because of its peculiar yellowish, bile-colored appearance. A common species with a worldwide distribution, it is often found on bark mulch in urban areas after heavy rain or excessive watering. Their spores are produced on or in aerial sporangia and are spread by wind.
History and taxonomy.
The first description of the species was provided by French botanist Jean Marchant in 1727, who referred to it as "flowers of tan"; Marchant classified it as a "sponge". Carl Linnaeus called it "Mucor septicus" in his 1763 "Species Plantarum". The species was transferred to the genus "Fuligo" by German botanist Friedrich Heinrich Wiggers in 1780.
In Scandinavian folklore, "Fuligo septica" is identified as the vomit of troll cats.
Description and habitat.
Like many slime molds, the cells of this species typically aggregate to form a plasmodium, a multinucleate mass of undifferentiated cells that may move in an ameboid-like fashion during the search for nutrients. "F. septica"'s plasmodium may be anywhere from white to yellow-gray, typically in diameter, and thick. The plasmodium eventually transforms into a sponge-like aethalium, analogous to the spore-bearing fruiting body of a mushroom; which then degrades, darkening in color, and releases its dark-colored spores. This species is known to have its spores dispersed by beetles (family Lathridiidae).
The spores have a two-layered wall, with a dense outer layer with spines, and a fibrous inner layer. During germination, the outer layer splits to create an opening, and more elastic inner layer ruptures later as protoplasm emerges. A remnant of the inner layer may be persistent and adhere to the protoplast after it has emerged from the spore. A peroxidase enzyme present in the inner cell wall plays a role in germination.
"Fuligo septica" grows on rotten wood and plant debris, but can also grow on the leaves and stems of living plants.
Human pathogenicity.
This species is known to cause asthma and allergenic rhinitis in susceptible people.
Resistance to metal toxicity.
Slime molds have a high resistance to toxic levels of metals; one author was prompted to write "The levels of Zn in "Fuligo septica" were so high (4,000–20,000 ppm) that it is difficult to understand how a living organism can tolerate them." The resistance to extreme levels of zinc appears to be unique to "F. septica". The mechanism of this metal resistance is now understood: "F. septica" produces a yellow pigment called fuligorubin A, which has been shown to chelate metals and convert them to inactive forms.
Model of RNA processing.
Introns are sections of DNA that must be properly cleaved, digested and processed prior to rendering functional mRNAs for protein synthesis. Because it has a large number of group I introns, "F. septica" is used as a model to understand the processing and evolution of RNA.
Bioactive compounds.
Extracts from "F. septica" show antibiotic activity against "Bacillus subtilis" and "Candida albicans", and cytotoxic activity on KB cells (a cell line derived from a human carcinoma of the nasopharynx).
"Fuligo septica" contains a yellow pigment called fuligorubin A that is thought to be involved in photoreception and in the process of energy conversion during its life cycle. In 2011 a Japanese research group reported isolating and characterizing a new chlorine-containing yellow pigment from form "flava" that they called dehydrofuligoic acid.

Charles Harrison (Bewdley MP)

Charles Harrison (1830 - 11 May 1888) was a British businessman and Liberal politician.
He was the younger son of Benjamin Harrison of Liverpool and his wife, Hannah King of Stourbridge. Harrison entered business with Mr B Devey, a wharfinger at Stourport-on-Severn. Among the goods that were dealt with on the wharf were locally-produced carpets of George Harris. On Harris's retirement Harrison purchased his carpet manufacturing business, and continued to actively run the company until shortly before his death.
Apart from his business activities, Harrison was a magistrate for Worcestershire and a member of the Stourport local board and a number of other institutions in the area. In 1874 he was invited to stand as Liberal candidate for the parliamentary borough of Bewdley in place of Augustus Anson who had retired from parliament. Harrison held the seat for the Liberals, defeating his Conservative opponent Stanley Leighton by 514 votes to 405. At the ensuing general election in 1880 Harrison was re-elected, defeating K E Webster by 598 votes to 530. However, Harrison was unseated on petition, and retired from parliamentary politics.
Harrison made his home at Areley Court, Areley Kings, near Stourport. He married Elizabeth Augusta Kempson of Edgbaston, Birmingham in 1858. He died at his home in May 1888 after a long illness.

Sarah Doyle Women's Center

The Sarah Doyle Women's Center is an organization at Brown University, founded in 1974, which "seeks to provide a comfortable, yet challenging place for students, faculty, and staff to examine the multitude of issues around gender". It was named in honor of the prominent Rhode Island educator, Sarah Doyle.
About Sarah Doyle Women's Center.
The Sarah Doyle Women's Center (SDWC) welcomes women and men who have interests in issues of gender and in issues that concern women in particular. The Center offers a variety of services and programs, as well as meeting space for university and community groups. The SDWC houses an art gallery, a darkroom, an extensive library and resource center, and a student lounge. It is affiliated with the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women.
The Sarah Doyle Gallery.
The Sarah Doyle Gallery is a professional art gallery within the Women's Center. It exhibits six to seven juried shows a year, as well as an annual commencement show. The goal of the gallery is to expose Brown students to high quality professional artwork on campus. The gallery openings offer everyone the chance to interact with the artists, ask them questions, and occasionally enjoy talk from the artists. The gallery brings all kinds of diverse and interesting people from campus, the Providence, Rhode Island community, and the region into the women's center, giving them a chance to discover everything else the Women's Center at Brown has to offer.
Library.
The library has over 4,000 volumes and films available to students, staff, and faculty, and subscribes to a variety of scholarly journals, news journals, and magazines.
Photo Club.
The Brown Photo Club manages two student darkrooms, one in Faunce House, which is currently under construction, and one in the Sarah Doyle Women's Center. Each darkroom is equipped with two Saunders variable contrast enlargers with 4x5 capacity, and a 16x20 archival print washer. The Sarah Doyle darkroom is for printing black and white only. The work room in the Sarah Doyle has a 16x20 heat press and a matt cutter.
Emergency Resources.
SDWC provides confidential crisis support and information for any Brown student dealing with sexual assault. The on-call counselor is also available to accompany a victim to the hospital.
Sexual Assault Response and Prevention Program is the main resource for helping students affected by sexual violence. Confidential services include support for a survivor or the friends of a survivor, help filing a complaint (if that is the student's choice) and educational programs for the student community. As part of the Advocates Program, SDWC staff members are trained to help any Brown student explore his/her options to address an incident of sexual assault or sexual harassment. Talking with an Advocate does not require a student to file a disciplinary complaint or pursue any specific course of action.
Sarah Doyle.
In 1891, the first women were admitted to Brown University. Sarah Doyle spearheaded a drive to construct a classroom building for Brown’s women students, called "Pembroke Hall." At the dedication of Pembroke Hall on November 22, 1897, Sarah Doyle spoke what are undoubtedly her most famous words: “The women’s sphere is one of infinite and indeterminate radius.”
Sarah Doyle was a teacher and a prominent Providence clubwoman. At the turn of the century, causes such as women’s education and suffrage, movements against child labor and towards a cure for tuberculosis, found an organizational and financial platform through the upper class social network of clubs. The Rhode Island Women’s Club was created in 1876 due in large part to Sarah Doyle’s efforts, as was the Rhode Island Society for the College Education of Women (RISCEW) and the Rhode Island School of Design, one of the nation’s premiere art schools.

Ocellated dragonet

Synchiropus ocellatus (Ocellated dragonet or Scooter Dragonet) is a species of tropical marine fish in the Dragonet (Callionymidae) family. It is native to the southwest Pacific Ocean from southern Japan to the Marquesan Islands.
Name.
The Scooter Dragonet is often referred to as the Ocellated Dragonet and, in the aquarium trade, as the Scooter Blenny. This often causes confusion because many then believe that the species is a member of the Blenny family when it is actually not. The same species is also occasionally listed under the scientific name "Neosynchiropus ocellatus", and many mistakenly believe they are separate species.
Physical description.
The Scooter Dragonet grows to approximately long. Viewed from above, it is distinctly diamond-shaped with the horizontal pectoral fins located at its widest point. It is brown and tan with a striped or spotted pattern- males are usually more colorful and have a large sail-like dorsal fin that is bright orange at the base.
Habitat.
The Scooter Dragonet is a reef-associated bottom dwelling fish that inhabits shallow, tropical waters, usually sandy lagoons or rocky reefs. They tend to form loose congregations of several individuals, but do not exhibit schooling behavior or other forms of social cooperation. Scooter Dragonets' diet consists almost entirely of Copepods: small zooplankton living in the water column. However, in captivity the Scooter Dragonet can often be acclimated to consuming live, frozen or even artificial foods, such as flakes.

Picturesque dragonet

Picturesque dragonet, "Synchiropus picturatus", is a brightly colored member of the dragonet family native to the Indo-West Pacific: Philippines, eastern Indonesia and northwest Australia. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade, where it is commonly known as the spotted mandarin, psychedelic mandarin or target mandarin. 
Description.
The picturesque dragonet may grows to a size of 7 cm in length. They have thick slime on their skin that inhibits many types of parasitic infection and minimizes the risk of disease following stress or physical trauma. This seems to help protect them from some other more aggressive fish.
The fish "Synchiropus picturatus" is one of only two animal species known to have blue coloring because of cellular pigment, the other being the closely related mandarinfish ("S. splendidus"). The name "cyanophore" was proposed for the blue chromatophores, or pigment-containing and light-reflecting cells. In all other known cases, the colour blue comes from thin-film interference from piles of flat, thin and reflecting purine crystals.
Relationships to humans.
The picturesque dragonet is a reef dweller, and so a reef-like environment is ideal for them. Natural feeding habits entail constantly browsing the substrate for copepods and other small invertebrates. Systems with an additional refugium are ideal, as these can help to generate suitable levels of food organisms as it prefers to peck on live rock. Because of this it can be a hard fish to keep.
It can, however, be weaned on to frozen food such as "Mysis", "Artemia" and other prepared foods but these alone are unlikely to sustain them, particularly if it is having to compete with other tankmates.
The picturesque dragonet is peaceful and does better with peaceful tankmates, such as seahorses.

Banknotes of Zimbabwe

The paper money of Zimbabwe were physical forms of Zimbabwe’s four incarnations of the dollar ($ or Z$) from 1980 to 2009. The banknotes of the first dollar replaced those of the Rhodesian dollar at par in 1980 following the proclamation of independence. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe issued most of the banknotes and other types of currency notes in its history, including Bearer cheques and Agro cheques ("Agro" being short for Agricultural) in the period between 2003 and 2008: the Standard Chartered Bank also issued emergency cheques from 2003 to 2004. 
The main illustration on the obverse of banknotes issued since 1980 is the Chiremba Balancing Rocks in Epworth, Harare. The rocks were part of the Reserve Bank's emblem, which was used for all Bearer and Agro cheques, which circulated between 15 September 2003 and 31 December 2008. The reverse of dollar notes often illustrate the culture or landmarks of Zimbabwe.
The second dollar (ZWN) was replaced on 1 August 2008 by the third dollar (ZWR), which was then phased out by fourth dollar (ZWL) with short notice on 2 February 2009 because it rapidly lost value. The economic and trade sanctions imposed against the Zimbabwean government and the Reserve Bank have made it difficult to incorporate modern security features on most banknotes issued since September 2008.
The banknotes of the third dollar were originally scheduled to be demonetised on 30 June 2009 but the Zimbabwean dollar as a whole has been suspended since 12 April 2009, implying that banknotes of both the third and fourth dollar are not de jure legal tender.
History.
The first banknotes of Zimbabwe were issued by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (formerly Reserve Bank of Rhodesia) for the first dollar (ZWD) in 1980 to coincide with the independence of Zimbabwe. These notes replaced the circulating banknotes of the Rhodesian Dollar at par. The first series of banknotes ranged from $2 to $20, and carried the signature of Dr. Desmond Krogh, then the last Governor of the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia from 1973. From 1994 to 1997 the Reserve Bank issued a new series of notes ranging from $2 to $100, although the $2 banknote was withdrawn and replaced by a coin in 1997. As rising inflation started to affect the purchasing power of the Zimbabwean Dollar, the $500 and $1 000 banknotes were issued from 2001 to 2005 with enhanced anti-counterfeiting measures. 
The RBZ also issued special traveller's cheques in 2003, with six denominations ranging from $1 000 to $100 000. These were short-lived due to unpopularity with the general public: identification was required both during issue and encashment of such cheques, which could only be used once by the bearer. As usual, banks levied a commission fee on all of the cheques. 
On 15 September 2003, the RBZ and Standard Chartered issued special Bearer cheques with denominations ranging from $5 000 to $20 000. These, and subsequent issues of the first and second dollars were time limited and lacked sophisticated anti-counterfeiting measures which were heavily used in many modern banknotes such as those of the Swiss Franc. In the first half of 2006 new denominations of $50 000 and $100 000 were issued, with the $1 million denomination being planned for September 2006; it was subsequently never issued.
The time limits were either ignored or extended by multiple decrees, meaning that all notes of these issues remained legal tender in practice until 21 August 2006. 
On 1 August 2006 the banknotes of the second dollar (ZWN), with less elaborate designs, replaced those of the first dollar at the ratio of 1 000 to 1. The redenomination (codenamed Operation Sunrise) was heavily publicised under the banner "Zero to Hero", but was also rapid and disorganised which resulted in many people being unable to convert their old Bearer cheques to new issues before the lapse date, The Reserve Bank Governor Dr. Gideon Gono said that "10 trillion (first dollars) were still out there and it had become manure". 
Further denominations ranging from $5 000 to $500 million were issued in the period between August 2006 and May 2008 as cent cheques quickly became outmoded. In the second quarter of 2008, special Agro cheques (Agricultural Cheques) were issued in denominations ranging from $5 billion to $100 billion as the currency exchange rate was floated. Since the functions were similar to Bearer cheques, it was in regular use as prices continue to rise. These cheques also carried time limits and limited security features. In the final months of the second dollar, the $200 000 cheque was the lowest legal tender denomination by decree, despite having its expiry date extended twice. The $100 000 000 Bearer Cheque would have been the lowest legal tender denomination in circulation had the expiry dates of currency cheques been enforced without extension, with the $100 billion Agro Cheque being the highest whether or not the $200 000 note was legal tender.
Munich-based security printers Giesecke & Devrient ceased providing banknote paper to the Reserve Bank on 1 July 2008 in response to an official request from the German government and widespread calls for sanctions; The Jura JSP software end-user licence, issued to the state-owned Fidelity Printers & Refiners was also terminated on 24 July 2008 for similar reasons although the official press statement quoted that it was de facto impossible to prevent the printers from using the software.
On 1 August 2008 the banknotes of the third dollar (ZWR), which were printed for the abandoned second phase of the 2006 redenomination, replaced the cheques of the second dollar at the ratio of 10 billion (1010) to 1. The Bearer and Agro cheques of the second dollar were phased out along with the smaller denominations of the third dollar on 1 January 2009. Despite the reform the Reserve Bank issued several high-value denominations up to $100 trillion ($1014) in the period between September 2008 to January 2009, which merely kept in similar pace with the cash rate instead of the black market rates. 
On 2 February 2009, banknotes of the fourth dollar (ZWL) were introduced to replace those of the third dollar at the ratio of one trillion (1012) to 1. It was originally envisaged that banknotes of the third dollar would remain legal tender until 30 June 2009 but all banknotes were withdrawn from circulation following the suspension of the Zimbabwe dollar on 12 April 2009.
Paper money of the first dollar (ZWD).
The Chiremba Balancing Rocks near Harare is the main artwork used for obverse sides of the first two banknote designs of the first Zimbabwean dollar. Notes of these design also feature on either side major landmarks and landscapes such as the Kariba Dam and fauna. As hyperinflation took hold at the end of the 20th century the quality of the notes deteriorated as printing plates from previous issues were reconstituted for printing emergency notes. Although the notes of the first design were gradually phased out from 1997, all remaining notes of the first dollar were forcibly demonetised on 22 August 2006.
Desmond Krogh series.
The Desmond Krogh series was the first series of banknotes for Zimbabwe, which carried the signature of Dr. Desmond C. Krogh, then the last governor of the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia. They are dated 1980 but issued in 1981 (except for the $20 note, which was issued in 1982). The notes bear Salisbury as the name of its capital rather than Harare, as the name was changed on 18 April 1982. There are four denominations in this series: $2, $5, $10 and $20; its designs make extensive use of the Guilloché technique, heavily relied upon by banknotes of many currencies during the 1980s.
The 1982-dated issues banknotes differed little from the earlier, except that it took into account of the renaming of the country's capital from Salisbury to Harare. However, there was an error with early runs of the $10 banknote (Pick no. 3b), because it bears Salisbury as the name of the capital city instead of Harare. These type of issues are rare. Later runs of the $10 note (Pick no. 3c) corrected the error. There were no $2 banknotes dated 1982: the second run of this denomination was taken in 1983 with K. Moyana as governor of the Reserve Bank.
Kombo Moyana series.
The Kombo Moyana series refers to a series of banknotes which carried Kombo Moyana's signature after being appointed governor of the Reserve Bank from 1983 to August 1993. The series bears the new name of Zimbabwe's capital (Harare) and is indifferent to the last two series except for the date and signature.
Leonard Tsumba series.
In August 1993, Leonard L. Tsumba replaced K. Moyana as governor of the Reserve Bank. The banknotes which carried his signature are referred to as the Leonard Tsumba series. 
The first banknotes to be issued with his signature was the two last runs of the original designs, dated 1994. The first run, which consisted of denominations from $2 to $20, had the original watermark of the Zimbabwe Bird (profile angle, short neck), whilst the second run consisted only of the $2 and $5 denominations, bearing the watermark of the bird with a longer neck and at ¾ profile angle.
In 1994 the general design of the banknotes was reviewed to keep up with advancing technologies against counterfeiting, which resulted in the release of two new denominations ($50 and $100) between 1994 and 1995, also to counter the effects of consumer price inflation, which peaked at 41.6% in 1992. Although the Chiremba Balancing Rocks were retained, other features including latent imaging in which the letters RBZ can be seen when the banknote is tilted horizontally at the eye level and identification marks for the visually impaired were added to the design, and the neck of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark was longer. The $5, $10 and $20 banknotes were also revised with the new designs in 1997, whilst the $2 banknote was and replaced by a coin in the same year with the $5 denomination undergoing the same process in August 2001.
The $500 denomination was first issued with red as the main colour in 2001. The 2003-dated versions were brown. It was followed by the $1 000 denomination on 2 October 2003, the sole difference between the two variants of the $1 000 notes (Pick no. 12) only being the typeface of the serial number.
Gideon Gono series.
The Gideon Gono series of 2004 carried the signature of the incumbent Reserve Bank governor, Dr. Gideon Gono and consisted of only one denomination of the first dollar ($500). This was the last series of regular banknotes of the first dollar, as hyperinflation forced all regular banknotes series out of use, although remaining legal tender theoretically until 21 August 2006.
Standard Chartered series.
The Standard Chartered series was a series of emergency bearer cheques issued by the Standard Chartered Bank (hence the title on the top of these cheques) and the Cargill Cotton Group. They were authorised by the Reserve Bank as legitimate issues and were valid for six months from the date of issue, the first currency notes of the Zimbabwean dollar to have a time limit. They carry the signature of the company's finance director Priscilla Mutenbwa and operations director Stephen Newton-Howes.
2003 bearer cheque series.
The 2003 bearer cheque series was a series of emergency currency notes of the first dollar which were in circulation between 15 September 2003 and the withdrawal of the first dollar on 21 August 2006. The $5 000, $10 000 and $20 000 denominations were issued from 15 September 2003, whilst the $50 000 and $100 000 denominations, depicting Victoria Falls on reverse, were introduced on 1 October 2005. Following the redenomination of August 2006, bearer cheques that were originally scheduled to expire on 31 December 2006 were demonetised early.
Bearer cheques dated 15 September 2003 bear the signature of the acting governor Charles Chikaura. The remainder of the series bear the signature of Dr. Gideon Gono, who was appointed governor in November 2003.
Paper money of the second dollar (ZWN).
The Zimbabwean dollar was first redenominated on 1 August 2006 under a currency reform campaign codenamed "Operation Sunrise" and involving the motto "Zero to Hero". New-style bearer cheques of the second dollar (ISO 4217:ZWN) was introduced and replaced those of the first dollar (ZWD) at the ratio of 1 000 to 1. 
The change over process was given at short notice and was also rapid because all issues prior to the August 2006 series were to be demonetised and rendered worthless on 21 August 2006. Poor communications meant that many civilians of Zimbabwe were unable to convert old bearer cheques to new ones before the deadline.
2006, 2007 and 2008 Bearer cheque series.
The 2006 bearer cheque series was put into circulation on 1 August 2006 and initially consisted of 14 denominations, ranging from 1¢ to $100 000. The cheques were signed by Dr. Gideon Gono and were set to expire on 31 July 2007, except for the $100 and $500 cheques, which were initially due to expire on 31 December 2007, but later extended to 31 July 2008. The $5 denomination was also issued, despite not being widely publicised in the changeover campaign.
Two variations that were issued for the $10 000 and $100 000 denominations are recognised in the Standard Catalog of World Paper Money: the difference between them was the use of digit grouping. Cheques with the denomination expressed as '10000' or '100000' bear serial numbers with the (scarce) prefix AA, while notes with prefixes AB onwards is expressed as '10 000' or '100 000'.
The 2007 bearer cheque series was first issued on 2 March 2007 with the introduction of $5 000 and $50 000 cheques to act as intermediary denominations between the $1 000, $10 000 and $100 000 cheques respectively. As inflation intensified, the $200 000 bearer cheque was also introduced on 1 August 2007, followed by the joint introduction of the $250 000, $500 000, and $750 000 denominations on 20 December 2007. The $200 000 bearer cheque had its date of lapse extended twice up to 31 December 2008.
The $50 000 denomination was the first denomination to use the Optically Variable Ink technique, on the value positioned at the top right of the obverse. The $750 000 denomination of the December 2007 series was the only note out of all cheques of the second dollar to bear a holographic strip, as the cheque was printed on paper that was prepared for the 1 000 ZWD notes (Pick No. 12).
The circulation of the 2008 bearer cheque series commenced on 18 January 2008 with three denominations ranging from $1 million to $10 million, and concluded with the issue of the $500 million bearer cheque on 15 May 2008. Three denominations of the 2008 series remained legal tender at the ratio of 1010 to 1 until being demonetised on 31 December 2008.
There are two variants of the $10 million denomination, the primary difference being the typeface and size of the serial number. Those with slightly larger serial numbers bear the prefix DA. The $25 million banknote is larger in dimension out of the rest of the 2008 series.
Agro cheque series.
The Reserve Bank issued Special Agro (Agricultural) cheques from 15 May to 31 July 2008. Although of a different design and with the intention for use only by farmers, it had found its way into regular use because of the parallel functions with bearer Cheques and the exponential rise of food prices. Following the 2008 currency reform, Agro and bearer cheques were phased out on 1 January 2009.
The four denominations in this series are not the same by dimensions as the $25 billion note used different paper from the 500 ZWD banknote of 2001. The $100 billion ($1011) Agro Cheque was the largest of the second dollar, sharing the record for the most number of zeroes depicted on a banknote with the Yugoslav 500 billion ($5×1011) dinar note of 1993, up until January 2009. 
Paper money of the third dollar (ZWR).
The 2007 banknote series was prepared by the Reserve Bank in October 2006 for the abandoned second phase of Operation Sunrise. The Chiremba Balancing Rocks was to be reinstated as the main feature on the obverse whilst use of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark continued. There were additional security features as opposed to previous issues, which included security threads, see-through register marks and recognition marks for the partially sighted. Holographic security threads and Optically Variable Ink were used on the $100, $500 and $1 000 notes. When the redenomination of 1 August 2008 occurred these notes were put into circulation as banknotes of the third dollar between 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008.
The 2008 banknote series circulated from 29 September 2008 to 12 April 2009. The series demonstrated the intensity of hyperinflation during the period as the highest denomination increased from $1 000 to $100 trillion ($1014) by January 2009, the latter being the largest denomination issued by the Reserve Bank. The first issues of the series were the $10 000 and $20 000 denominations. These were followed by the following denominations:
The large number of denominations issued in late-2008 as well as the suspension of paper supply by Giesecke & Devrient affected the Reserve Bank's ability to maintain the quality of the banknotes. Later denominations copied design features from the original 2007 banknote series and lacked many modern security features that banknotes of major currencies (such as the Canadian Dollar) relied on. The notes denominated from $20 000 to $500 000 and then from $10 million onwards used non-watermarked paper, whilst the $500 million notes were printed on pure cotton. A silhouette of the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable Ink was used in such notes to compensate for this, but the iridescent strip was dropped for higher denominations. The $10 000 and $1 000 000 notes reused paper for the $1 000 notes (Pick no. 72), thereby carrying the embedded holographic thread and watermark. Two types of paper (regular and lined) were used on $20 000, $50 000 and $500 000 banknotes.
Paper money of the fourth dollar (ZWL).
The Zimbabwe dollar was again reformed on 2 February 2009 when the fourth dollar replaced the third dollar at the ratio of 1 000 000 000 000 (1012) to 1 with the original intention of phasing out the latter by 1 July 2009. The 2009 banknote series was issued for the fourth dollar which circulated from 2 February 2009 until the suspension of the dollar on 12 April 2009. The series consisted of denominations ranging from $1 to $500. The notes had a revised design with chevrons as registration devices, the Zimbabwe Bird in optically variable ink and an iridescent strip. Most parts of the design were recycled from designs of past issues and do not have a watermark although a plain space existed in the areas where it would normally be positioned.
Replacement banknotes.
Special prefixes were allocated for Replacement banknotes of Zimbabwe. The prefixes used were as follows:
Valuation and collecting ability.
Hyperinflationary Zimbabwean banknotes (such as the $100 trillion denomination) have gained considerable interest from the Numismatic community and buyers in general for its absurdity rather than the design. Some examples of such notes may be sold further in excess of their true face value. 
The price and value of a Zimbabwean banknote depend on various factors: the rarity, based on factors such as the name of capital city, how long it was printed, or the type of watermark; its condition, and the national situation at time of issue, such as shortages or hyperinflation. Common designs and variants such as the $100 note of 1995 (Pick no. 9) are usually valued at about $1 apiece, while rare varieties such as the $10 Salisbury error note (Pick no. 3b) and the Standard Chartered issues are valued at around $100 or more. Zimbabwean banknotes are usually sold by banknote dealers over the counter or on the internet, although the most valued types theoretically qualify for inclusion in auction.
Other circulating banknotes.
As in every fiscal emergency, hard currency, particularly the United States dollar, has long served as a parallel currency on the black market, and many prices in shops would be posted in US dollars, even during periods when it was illegal to possess foreign currency or to transact business in US dollars. 
A unique form of circulating specie is the Petrol Coupon, which has been issued in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Known denominations include 1, 5, 10, 20, & 50 litres of petrol (gasoline) and/or diesel, and translate roughly into the local petrol price (about 1 UK pound sterling per litre or US$1.50 in late 2008). Businesses, including Western Union, have been reported paying employees with these coupons, and even auctions have been transacted in this currency. As with much Zimbabwe currency, printing standards are crude and counterfeiting is rampant; the RBZ has been dissuading this widespread use.
Notes.
I. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe issued 21 additional denominations between 1 September 2008 and 2 February 2009. They were as follows: $1 000, $10 000, $20 000, $50 000, $100 000, $500 000, $1 million, $10 million, $50 million, $100 million, $200 million, $500 million, $1 billion, $5 billion, $10 billion, $20 billion, $50 billion, $10 trillion, $20 trillion, $50 trillion and $100 trillion.
Information about the 2008 banknote series which involved the issue of such notes can be found in the section Paper money of the third dollar (ZWR).
II. The Interbank, black market and official exchange rates were monitored for a time after the suspension of the dollar on 12 April 2009: for example, on 2 August 2009 one US dollar would buy Z$363.07.
III. The $100 trillion (1014) banknote (Pick No. 91) is the largest denomination ever issued by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and is accepted by most numismatists as a banknote with the most zeroes ever shown in the design. Before 16 January 2009 the 500 billion dinar (5×1011) banknote of Yugoslavia (Pick No. 137) held such status.
However, the Guinness World Records recognises the Hungarian 1 billion b.-pengő (1021) banknote (Pick No. 137) as the world's largest denomination, although the 100 million b.-pengő (1020) (Pick No. 136) was the largest denomination to be issued.

Resting Satyr

The Resting Satyr or Leaning Satyr, also known as the Satyr anapauomenos (in ancient Greek , from / "anapaúô", to rest) is a statue type generally attributed to the ancient Greek sculptor Praxiteles. 115 examples of the type are known, of which the best known is in the Capitoline Museums.
Description.
It shows a young satyr, identifiable from his clearly pointed ears and the "pardalide" (panther pelt) worn across his torso. He rests his right elbow on a tree trunk, in an unstable position, supported only on his left leg. His right leg is bent, with his right foot just touching his left heel. In a number of examples a restorer has added an attribute held in his right hand, often a flute or Pan pipes, while the left hand is on the left hip holding down the pelt. The facial features are well defined and the nose slightly upturned. His heavy hair, recalling the iconography of river gods, is held by a cord or a crown.
Attribution.
The Resting Satyr is traditionally identified as the "satyr "periboêtos"" mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his "Natural History" XXXIV, 69:
Since Winckelmann this word has traditionally been translated as "famous". This celebrity explains the large number of examples of this type, one of the most popular in the Mediterranean - just under 115 have been found, including 15 from Rome, 4 from North Africa, 8 from Greece, two from Spain and one from Gaul.

North Tamerton () is a civil parish and village in east Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The village is situated approximately eight miles (13 km) southeast of Bude and eight miles (13 km) north of Launceston. 
North Tamerton is a thinly populated rural parish and is in the registration District of Stratton. It is bounded to the east by the River Tamar which delineates Cornwall's border with Devon but the border extends across the river making North Tamerton the only parish in Cornwall which extends east of the Tamar. North Tamerton is the only village in the parish, the other settlements being farmsteads and hamlets 
The name Tamerton derives from 'estate on the Tamar'. To the west, the parish is bounded by the Cornish parishes of Whitstone and Week St Mary and population at the 2001 census was 288.

The 15th century church is dedicated to St Denis and is located at . The church has a chancel, nave, south aisle and a granite ashlar battlemented tower in height. The belfry houses a ring of six bells, and a local tradition says that the treble bell came from Tetcott church, across the River Tamar, and John Taylor the bell-founder having recast North Tamerton's ring of five in the early 19th century sold the treble to Tetcott so that the parishioners at North Tamerton could hear it across the valley and decide to acquire it.

Bahjat Ghanem military base

Bahjat Ghanem military base ( "Thouknat Bahjat Ghanem") is the headquarters of the Lebanese Army North regional command located in Tripoli, in the North Governorate. This command was established few months after the Lebanese Army was handed to Lebanon from the French Mandate, and thus it is considered one of the oldest units in the army.
History.
The North regional command was founded in 1946, and used to have three military bases, Youssef Rahmeh military base (located in the Cedar region), George al-Nghayweh military base (located in Andqit) and the Second Sharp Shooters Regiment. In the early 1960s up until the early 1970s, three ground forces were added to the base, which were the Seventh Sharp Shooters Regiment, the Fourth Artillery Regiment and the Third Armored Regiment. Later, a brigade previously used for operations was established, named the Second Brigade and was given its command to the regional commander. In 1983, the Second Brigade was detached from the base and became directly connected to the Lebanese army, thus the authority of the regional commander became limited to logistics, operational, and emergency missions.
Currently, and in addition to the Cedar and Andqit military bases, the military regional command controls two other bases, Nohra al-Shalouhi military base in Batroun and Najib Salameh military base in Kleyate.
Mission.
The mission of the military base includes:
In addition, the military base have also operational and training missions. Operational missions include peacekeeping and reinforcing the abilities of the brigades and regiments in the region, implementing a semi and full alert day and detecting all sorts of explosives, in addition to supervising development programs, supplying emergency units during national religious holidays and offering a communication system for the deployed brigades and regiments in the region. Training missions include supervising shooting ranges located in the region (taking into consideration the security precautions), giving annual physical exams to the officers, army and those who are nominated for promotion due to long periods of military service, giving preliminary exams to the educational offices and supervising the military sports stadiums located in the region.
Conscription.
The department for conscription was founded on December 9, 1993. Its three main objectives are:
Emblem.
The emblem of the North regional command is constituted of Cedar trees with snow capped mountains, the fortress of Tripoli, and a sword in the middle, while surrounded by two laurel leaves and the Arabic inscription of the military base's name.

Zimbabwean dollar

The Zimbabwean dollar (sign: $, or Z$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies) was the official currency of Zimbabwe from 1980 to 12 April 2009, with three periods of inflation. 
Although the dollar was considered to be among the highest-valued currency units when it was introduced in 1980 to replace the Rhodesian dollar at par, political turmoil and hyperinflation rapidly eroded the value of the Zimbabwe dollar to become one of the least valued currency units in the world, undergoing three redenominations, with high face value paper denominations, including a $100 trillion banknote (1014). The third redenomination produced the "fourth dollar" (ZWL), which was worth 1 trillion ZWR (third dollar), or 1025 ZWD (first dollar).
Despite attempts to control inflation by legislation, and three redenominations (in 2006, 2008 and 2009), use of the Zimbabwean dollar as an official currency was effectively abandoned on 12 April 2009 due to the skyrocketing inflation. According to some sources, a person would starve on just a billion Zimbabwe dollars. This was a result of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe legalising use of foreign currencies for transactions in January 2009.
Currencies such as the South African rand, Botswana pula, pound sterling, euro, Yuan and the United States dollar are now used for all transactions in Zimbabwe; the policy of the government of Zimbabwe has insisted that any attempts to reintroduce Zimbabwean currency should be considered only if industrial output improves.
History.
The Zimbabwean dollar's predecessor, the Rhodesian dollar was essentially equal to half of a pound sterling when it was adopted during the decimalisation of 1970, the same practice which was used in other Commonwealth countries such as South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The selection of the name was motivated by the fact that the reduced value of the new unit correlated more closely to the value of the US dollar than it did to the pound sterling.
Design.
The main illustration on the obverse of banknotes issued since 1987 is the Chiremba Balancing Rocks in Epworth, Harare. The rocks are used as a metaphorical theme to explain the importance of development coupled with preserving the fragile environment. The rocks were part of the Reserve Bank's emblem, which was used for all Bearer and Agro cheques, which circulated between 15 September 2003 and 31 December 2008. The reverse of dollar notes often illustrate the culture or landmarks of Zimbabwe.
Introduction of the first dollar (ZWD).
The first Zimbabwean dollar was introduced in 1980 and replaced the Rhodesian dollar at par. The initial ISO 4217 code was "ZWD". At the time of its introduction, the Zimbabwean dollar was worth more than the U.S. dollar in the official exchange market, with ZWD 1 = USD 1.47. However, this value did not reflect reality. As a result, the currency's value, both in the official and parallel markets eroded rapidly over the years. On 26 July 2006, the parallel market value of the Zimbabwean dollar fell, to Z$100=GB£1.
First redenomination: introduction of the second dollar (ZWN).
In October 2005, the head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Dr. Gideon Gono, announced: "Zimbabwe will have a new currency next year." New banknotes and coins were to replace the then current Zimbabwean dollar. Gono did not provide a name for this new currency. In June 2006, Deputy Finance Minister David Chapfika stated that Zimbabwe had to achieve macroeconomic stability (i.e., double digit inflation) before any new currency was introduced.
On 1 August 2006, the first dollar was redenominated to the second dollar at the rate of 1 revalued second dollar = 1000 old first dollars. The new dollar was subdivided into 100 cents, although cents were not used in practice. Together with the redenomination, the government devalued the dollar by 60% against the US dollar (see exchange rate history table below), from 101,000 old dollars (101 revalued) to 250 revalued dollars. ISO originally assigned a new currency code of "ZWN" to this redenominated currency, but the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe could not deal with a currency change, so the currency code remained 'ZWD'. The revaluation campaign, which Gideon Gono named "Operation Sunrise", was completed on 21 August 2006. It was estimated that some ten trillion old Zimbabwe dollars (22% of the money supply) were not redeemed during this period.
On 12 December 2006, Gono hinted in a memorandum to banks and other financial institutions that he would lay out the next phase of his monetary reforms, dubbed "Project Sunrise Two", when he announced the monetary policy review statement in January 2007. It was not possible to get immediate confirmation from Gono's office whether the memorandum was advice to banks that he would be launching the new currency in January. Even so, the chief executive officer of one of the country's largest banks said industry players had understood the governor's memo to mean new money would be introduced the next month. A possible name appeared to be "ivhu", which means "soil" in Shona.
The following year, on 2 February 2007, the RBZ revealed that a new (third) dollar would be released soon and gave some details of the new banknotes (see below). However, with inflation at the time still in the four digits, the banknotes remained in storage. During the same month, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe declared inflation illegal, outlawing any raise in prices on certain commodities between 1 March and 30 June 2007. Officials arrested executives of some Zimbabwean companies for increasing prices on their products. Economists consider such measures ineffective at eliminating the problem of high inflation, since high sustained inflation is a symptom of high, sustained growth in the money supply.
On 15 June 2007, economist Eddie Cross reported: "There is talk that the Reserve Bank will cut another three zeros off our currency next week and this would mean that one Zimbabwe dollar would now equal one million of the old dollars. Chaos reigns in commerce and industry and those in the public sector are frantic."
On 6 September 2007, the Zimbabwe dollar was devalued again, this time by 92%, to give an official exchange rate of ZW$30,000 to US$1, although the black market exchange rate was estimated to be ZW$600,000 to US$1.
Meanwhile, the WM/Reuters company introduced a notional exchange rate (ISO ZWN) which more accurately reflected black market exchange rates. Due to a shortage of foreign exchange in the country, the official rate was nearly impossible to obtain. The method of calculation was based on Purchasing Power Parity utilising the dual listing of companies on the Harare (ZH) and London Stock exchanges (LN). In particular, the Old Mutual Implied Rate (OMIR) was calculated by dividing the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange price of shares of the insurance company named "Old Mutual" by the London Stock Exchange Price for the same share.
Second redenomination: introduction of the third dollar (ZWR).
Reserve bank governor Gideon Gono announced on 30 July 2008 that the Zimbabwean dollar would be redenominated. Effective 1 August 2008, ZW$10 billion would be worth ZW$1; the new currency code was ZWR. The planned denominations to be issued are coins valued Z$5, Z$10 and Z$25 and banknotes worth Z$5, Z$10, Z$20, Z$100 and Z$500. While the German firm of Giesecke & Devrient was no longer printing Zimbabwean currency, "The Daily Telegraph" reported that the new currency was printed before the relationship was severed and had been kept in storage since then.
Due to frequent cash shortages and the worthless Zimbabwean dollar, foreign currency was effectively legalised as a de facto currency on 13 September 2008 via a special program to officially license a number of retailers to accept foreign money. This reflected the reality of the dollarisation of the economy, with many shop keepers refusing to accept Zimbabwe dollars and requesting U.S. dollars or South African rand instead. Despite redenomination, the RBZ was forced to print banknotes of ever higher values to keep up with surging inflation, with ten zeros reappearing by the end of 2008 (see below).
Third redenomination: introduction of the fourth dollar (ZWL).
On 2 February 2009, the RBZ announced that a further 12 zeros were to be taken off the currency, with 1,000,000,000,000 (third) Zimbabwe dollars being exchanged for 1 new (fourth) dollar. New banknotes were introduced with a face value of Z$1, Z$5, Z$10, Z$20, Z$50, Z$100 and Z$500. The banknotes of the fourth dollar circulated alongside the third dollar, which had to remain legal tender until 30 June 2009. The new currency code was ZWL.
By the end of 2009 the Zimbabwean dollar was reported to have become largely irrelevant, with the economy by then being almost completely dollarized. Even the national postal service, Zimpost, was said to be charging customers postage in US Dollars, even though some of the stamps were in Zimbabwean Dollar denomination.
Zimbabwe finance minister, Tendai Biti, said in his first budget report, "The death of the Zimbabwe dollar is a reality we have to live with. Since October 2008 our national currency has become moribund."
In late January 2009, acting Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa announced that all Zimbabweans would be allowed to conduct business in any currency as a response to the hyperinflation crisis.
On 12 April 2009, media outlets reported that economic planning minister Elton Mangoma had announced the suspension of the local currency "for at least a year", effectively terminating the fourth dollar.
Inflation.
Rampant inflation and the collapse of the economy severely devalued the currency, with many organisations using the United States dollar, the euro, the pound sterling, the South African rand, or the Botswana pula instead. Early in the 21st century, Zimbabwe started to experience hyperinflation. Inflation reached 623% in January 2004, then fell back to low triple digits in 2004 before surging to 1,281.1% in 2006.
Inflation reached another record high of 3714% (year-on-year) in April 2007. The monthly rate for April 2007 exceeded 100%, implying that inflation may soon exceed all forecasts, as 100% monthly inflation over sustained 12 months would produce annual inflation of over 400,000%. Mid-year inflation for 2007 has been breaching records as inflation for May 2007 was estimated at 4,530% (year-on-year).
On 21 June 2007, the United States ambassador to Zimbabwe, Christopher Dell, told "The Guardian" newspaper that inflation could reach 1.5 million percent by the end of the year. The unofficial inflation rate at that time was above 11,000%, and the black-market exchange rate was Z$400,000 to the pound.
On 13 July 2007, the Zimbabwean government said it had temporarily stopped publishing (official) inflation figures, a move that observers said was meant to draw attention away from "runaway inflation which has come to symbolise the country's unprecedented economic meltdown."
On 27 July 2007, the Consumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ) said its recent calculations for the monthly expenditure for an urban family of six showed that inflation for the month of June was more than 13,000%. The Central Statistical Office (CSO), the official source of Consumer Price Index numbers, had not released its figures since February (2007) when it reported annual inflation at 1,729%.
In September 2007, the Central Statistical Office announced an official inflation rate of 6,592.8% for August 2007. Private estimates were as high as 20,000%. In October 2007, they announced an official inflation rate of 7,892.1% for September 2007. In November 2007, they announced an official inflation rate of 14,840.5% for October 2007.
Hyperinflation.
On 27 November 2007, the chief statistician of the Central Statistical Office, Moffat Nyoni, announced that it would be impossible to calculate the inflation rate of the dollar any further. This was due to the lack of availability of basic goods, and subsequent lack of information from which to calculate the inflation rate. The International Monetary Fund stated that inflation was predicted to rise to 100,000% per annum.
On 14 February 2008, the Central Statistical Office announced that the inflation rate for December 2007 was 66,212.3%, and the unofficial exchange rate was Z$7.1 million to the US$1.
On 20 February 2008, the Central Statistical Office said that officially, inflation has in January 2008 gone past the 100,000% mark to 100,580.2%.
On 4 April 2008, the "Financial Gazette" (FinGaz) reported that officially, inflation in February 2008 jumped to 164,900.3%.
On 15 May 2008, the "Zimbabwe Independent" reported that officially, inflation in March 2008 jumped to 355,000%.
On 21 May 2008, SW Radio Africa reported that, according to an independent financial assessment, inflation in May 2008 jumped to 1,063,572.6%. The state statistical service has said there are not enough goods in the shortage-stricken shops to calculate any new (official) figures.
On 26 June 2008, the "Zimbabwe Independent" reported that, latest figures from the Central Statistical Offices (CSO) showed that annual inflation rose by 7,336,000 percentage points to 9,030,000% by 20 June and was set to end the month at well above 10,500,000%.
The Sydney Morning Herald reported that inflation was likely to be 2 million percent in May 2008 and 10–15 million percent in June 2008, according to John Robertson, a respected Zimbabwean economist. Robertson estimated inflation in July 2008 to be 40–50 million percent. Inflation can only be estimated because of the impossibility of following the cost of individual goods.
According to Central Statistical Office statistics, annual inflation rate rose to 231 million percent in July 2008. The month-on-month rate rose to 2,600.2%. By December 2008, annual inflation was estimated at 650 million googol percent (6.5 × 10108 percent), equivalent to a "daily" inflation rate of 96%.
As predicted by the quantity theory of money, this hyperinflation has been caused primarily by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe's choice to mushroom the money supply.
Since February 2009, following a period of hyperinflation and widespread rejection of the devalued currency, companies and individuals are permitted to transact domestic business in other currencies, such as the US$ or the South African rand. In consequence, the Zimbabwean economy has undergone dollarisation and the Zimbabwean dollar has fallen out of everyday use.
Money supply (2006–2008).
On 16 February 2006, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, announced that the government had printed ZW$20.5 trillion in order to buy foreign currency to pay off IMF arrears. In early May 2006, Zimbabwe's government announced that they would produce another ZW$60 trillion. The additional currency was required to finance the recent 300% salary increase for soldiers and policemen and 200% increase for other civil servants. The money was not budgeted for the current fiscal year, and the government did not say where it would come from. On 29 May, Reserve Bank officials told IRIN that plans to print about ZW$60 trillion (about US$592.9 million at official rates) were briefly delayed after the government failed to secure foreign currency to buy ink and special paper for printing money.
In late August 2006, it was reported that about ZW$10 trillion old dollars (22% of the money supply) had "not" been exchanged for revalued dollars. These bearer cheques were demonetised.
On 27 June 2007, it was announced that central bank governor Gideon Gono had been ordered by President Robert Mugabe to print an additional Z$1 trillion to cater for civil servants' and soldiers' salaries that were hiked by 600% and 900% respectively.
On 28 July 2007, it was reported that Mugabe has said that Zimbabwe will go on printing money if there is not enough for underfunded municipal projects.
On 30 August 2007, it was reported that an additional ZW$3 trillion had been printed to pay for 500,000 scotch carts and 800,000 ox-drawn ploughs plus an unspecified number of cattle.
On 3 September 2007, it was reported that the black market in Zimbabwe is once again booming despite price controls. People who previously were employed for US$11 (Z$2 Million) a month are now able to turn as much as US$166 (ZW$30 Million) just through black market trading.
On 24 November 2007, it was reported that money supply was now $58 trillion revalued Zimbabwean dollars (ZWD) ($41 million US at parallel rates). However, Zimbabwe banks could only account for Z$1-2 trillion of those dollars, meaning that members of the public were holding Z$56-57 trillion in cash.
On 4 January 2008, it was reported that money supply had been increased by Z$33 trillion to Z$100 trillion revalued Zimbabwean dollars (ZWD). Further, the demonetisation of the Z$200,000 bearer cheques was put on hold, thus increasing the money supply.
The planned issue of additional banknotes (denominations of Z$1, Z$5, and Z$10 Million) on 18 January 2008 will increase the money supply by an unknown amount.
On 21 January 2008, it was reported, by Gideon Gono, that the money supply had been increased to Z$170 trillion since the middle of December. Further, Gono expected it to reach $800 trillion by 28 January 2008.
On 1 March 2008, it was reported that documents obtained by "The Sunday Times" show the Munich company Giesecke & Devrient (G&D) was receiving more than €500,000 (£382,000) a week for delivering bank notes equivalent to Z$170 trillion a week.
According to a source at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, G&D was delivering 432,000 sheets of banknotes every week to Fidelity printers in Harare, where they were stamped with the denomination. Each sheet contains 40 notes and the current production is entirely in Z$10 million notes. On 1 July 2008, Giesecke & Devrient responded to pressure from the German government by suspending production of bank notes for Zimbabwe.
In the Guardian, on 18 July 2008, a report on Zimbabwe's inflation, said that an egg costs Z$50 billion (GBP 0.17, USD 0.32), and it showed adverts for prizes of Z$100 trillion in a Zimbabwean derby and Z$1.2 quadrillion ($1,200,000,000,000,000.00: approx. £2,100; $4,200) in a lottery. It also showed a monthly war pension currently is Z$109 billion (37 pence, 74¢), shops can only cash cheques if the customer writes double the amount, because the cost will go up by the time the cheque has cleared, and people can only withdraw a maximum of Z$100 billion from cashpoints.
On 23 July 2008, an Austro-Hungarian company based in Vienna confirmed that it is providing the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe with the licences and software required to design and print Zimbabwe currency. The company, named Jura JSP, said it would consider ending its supply of licences and software if the European Union required it to do so. Without the licences and software, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe may be unable to print notes in larger denominations than are already in circulation.
On 24 July 2008, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe announced that "appropriate measures are being put in place to address the current setbacks being faced on the currency front, as well as on financial and accounting systems." It promised that in "the next few days" it would institute changes to the minimum cash withdrawal limits and IT systems' constraints. Currently, the government limits cash withdrawals to ZW$100 billion per day, which is less than the cost of a loaf of bread. IT systems cannot handle such large numbers; the automated teller machines for one major bank give a "data overflow error" and freeze customers' attempt to withdraw money with so many zeros. That same day, the Institute of Commercial Management reported that ZW$1.2 trillion is worth the same as one British pound.
From January to December 2008, the money supply growth rose from 81,143% to 658 billion percent.
Abandonment.
The use of foreign currencies was legalised in January 2009, causing general consumer prices to stabilise again after years of hyperinflation and price speculation. The move led to a sharp drop in the usage of the Zimbabwean dollar, as hyperinflation rendered even the highest denominations worthless.
On 2 February 2009 the Zimbabwean dollar was redenominated once more, at the ratio of 1 000 000 000 000 (1012) ZWR to 1 ZWL. The third dollar was expected to be demonetised on 1 July 2009, but the complete abandonment of local currency was hastened by the decline in overall consumer usage of local currency in favour of other currencies, helped by the legalisation of the use of hard currencies in January 2009.
The dollar was effectively abandoned as an official currency on 12 April 2009 when the Economic Planning Minister Elton Mangoma confirmed the suspension of the national currency for at least a year, but exchange rates with the Zimbabwean dollar were maintained for up to a year afterwards. The current government of Zimbabwe said that the Zimbabwean currency should only be reintroduced if the industrial output was 60% or more of its capacity, compared to the April 2009 average of 20%.
Coins.
In 1980, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 cents and 1 dollar. The 1 cent coin was struck in bronze, with the others struck in cupro-nickel. In 1989, bronze-plated steel replaced bronze. A 2 dollar coin was introduced in 1997. In 2001, nickel-plated steel replaced cupro-nickel in the 10, 20 and 50 cents and 1 dollar, and a bimetallic 5 dollar coin was introduced.
Plans by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, for new Z$5,000 and Z$10,000 coins were announced in June 2005. However, the coins never appeared.
All old coins dating from the first dollar were reintroduced at face value to the third dollar in Aug 2008, effectively increasing their value 10 trillion-fold, and new $10 and $25 coins were introduced. These coins were minted in 2003 but only issued with the redenomination.
Banknotes, traveller's cheques, and bearer cheques.
The banknotes of the Zimbabwean dollar were issued by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe from 1980 to 2009. Up to 2003 regular banknotes were issued but as hyperinflation developed from 2003, the Reserve Bank issued short-lived emergency travelers cheques, which were then quickly superseded by time-limited Bearer Cheques, in denominations ranging from $5 000 to $20 000 in 2003, then up to $100 000 dollars by early-2006.
On 1 August 2006, new Bearer cheques with thirteen denominations ranging from 1¢ to $100 000 were issued following the first redenomination of the dollar, superseding the regular banknotes by 21 August 2006 and until August 2008. Bearer cheques of 5,000 dollars (dated 1 February 2007) and 50,000 (dated 1 March 2007) were issued in March 2007, followed by cheques of 200,000 (dated 1 August 2007) in August 2007. Subsequently, Gideon Gono of the RBZ announced on 19 December 2007 that new bearer cheques (Z$250,000; Z$500,000; and Z$750,000) had been produced and would be released on 20 December. Additionally, the current high value bearer cheques (Z$200,000) would be demonetised as of 1 January 2008. However, due to ongoing problems, plans to demonetise this note were put on hold at the end of December.
Since the Zimbabwean dollar was revalued in August 2006, there were repeated discussions and proposals regarding a further revaluation. As early as the beginning of 2007 it appeared that a revaluation was planned with new banknote designs being commissioned. New plans were announced in October 2007 They were initially postponed until 2008 before, in November 2007, the revaluation was described as "imminent" and would remove as many as four zeros from the currency and would be called Sunrise 2. However, on 18 December 2007, it was reported that a further printing of the current Z$200,000 bearer cheques had been produced, seemingly instead of revaluing. Further new issues of bearer cheques have since taken place.
At a press conference on 16 January 2008, reserve bank Governor Gono stated that "With effect from Friday (January 18), the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is releasing the following bearer cheques into circulation: one million dollars (officially worth about US$33/22 euros but worth about 50c at the parallel rate), five million dollars and 10 million dollars." He continued, "...daily cash withdrawals have been increased from the current Z$50 million to Z$500 million per individual." Less than a month after announcing a similar move, Gono said the new notes would provide much needed relief to consumers who often have to go shopping with sacks of cash.
The "Zim Independent" and "Zim Online" reported on 4 April 2008 that 25 and 50 million dollar bearer cheques were issued on 4 April. The RBZ also increased the maximum withdrawal limit for individuals to $5 billion a day. On 6 May 100 million dollar and 250 million dollar bearer cheques were issued and the official exchange rate was floated to counter black market speculation. 10 days later, the RBZ announced that 500 million dollar bearer cheques and special agro cheques in the amounts of 5, 25, and 50 billion dollars would be issued were to be issued on 20 May.
On 14 July 2008 Giesecke & Devrient ceased supplying bank note paper to Fidelity Printers & Refiners, the Zimbabwean government-owned company that printed Zimbabwean currency. Virtually incessant use of the currency-printing presses had caused many of the machines to break down, and repair parts were no longer being shipped to Zimbabwe to repair the machines. The Reserve Bank issued the $100 billion Agro Cheque on 21 July, which were printed prior to the suspension.
On 30 July 2008 the RBZ announced a new currency, effective 1 August 2008, removing 10 zeros from the monetary value, by "a factor of 1 to 10". Banknotes in the denominations of $1, $5, $10, $20, $100 and $500 were introduced and replaced bearer cheques and agro cheques by 31 December 2008. However, the familiar cycle of printing ever higher denomination notes to keep up with inflation continued despite redenomination. A $1,000 banknote was introduced by the RBZ on 19 September 2008, and ten days later, as the unofficial exchange rate surpassed 270,000 ZWD to the US dollar, it issued new notes in the denominations of $10,000 and $20,000. A $50,000 banknote was released on 13 October 2008, followed by $100,000, $500,000, and $1,000,000 denominations announced on 3 November. The daily cash withdrawal limit was raised for individuals to Z$500,000 from Z$50,000 and for select companies it went up to $1 million. Banknotes valued at $10 million, $50 million and $100 million were issued as the withdrawal limit was increased to $100 million per week on 4 December 2008. Scarcely four days later, on 8 December, the RBZ issued a $200 million banknote, and introduced a $500 million note on 12 December, worth approximately US$8 at the time. In little over half a year, the billion denomination returned, with the RBZ issuing banknotes of $1 billion, $5 billion, and $10 billion on 19 December.
Amid the continuing hyperinflation that rendered the currency virtually worthless, spurring the increasing dollarisation of the economy, the RBZ issued another set of new notes in denominations of $20 billion and $50 billion to be released 12 January. Stepping up another order of magnitude, the Reserve Bank introduced trillion-denominated notes for the first time, unveiling banknotes valued at $10 trillion, $20 trillion, $50 trillion, and $100 trillion on 16 January, which were supposed to help citizens still in formal employment to withdraw a full month's worth of salary by showing a corresponding payslip. As even these notes became increasingly worthless, a media campaign was launched in South Africa using the notes as printing paper.
On 2 February 2009 the dollar was revalued once more, this time in the ratio of 1:1012, and new banknotes of the fourth dollar, with seven denominations from $1 to $500, were issued. These banknotes circulated alongside the third dollar until the abandonment of the dollar on 12 April 2009.
Exchange rate history.
This table shows a condensed history of the foreign exchange rate of the Zimbabwean Dollars to one US Dollar:
† Due to the December 2007 banknote shortage, funds transferred via Electronic Funds Transfer Systems (EFTS) bore a premium rate of about $4 million, while the cash transaction rate varied around $2 million.
‡ Exchange rate was 20,000,000 for large amounts.
The third dollar rates above are OMIR. The cash rate differs significantly to the above rates. The table below is the cash rate of the third dollar history:
Devaluation of the first dollar.
The first dollar devalued from 0.6788 R$ to 1 US$ in 1978 to roughly half a million per US$ in 2006, when the currency is revalued.
This table shows in more detail the historical value of one U.S. dollar in Zimbabwean dollars:
Devaluation of the second dollar.
The second dollar started off on 1 August 2006 with an official rate of 250 and a parallel rate of 550 to the US$. In July 2008 the dollar was revalued again, this time 10,000,000,000 2nd dollars became 1 3rd dollar, after the parallel rate reached 500 billion to 1 US$.
More detailed data can be found in the table below :
Restoration of market data feeds.
In the final months before Zimbabwe's central bank reforms of 30 April 2008, virtually all popular currency conversion resources relied upon the official rate of 30,000 ZWD to 1 USD for published figures, in spite of the vast differences between that and free market rates. By 23 May 2008, Bloomberg and Oanda began publishing floating rates based on Zimbabwe's formally regulated domestic bank market, while Yahoo Finance started using the updated official rate in July, albeit with a decimal point shift of 6 places. Those reported rates generally reflected the Official Rate as shown in the above table. They soon began to differ, in overvaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar, increasingly substantially in comparison to less regulated markets such as offshore markets or paper cash freely traded on the streets of Harare, reflected above as Parallel Rates.
Devaluation of the third dollar.
On 1 August 2008, ten zeroes were removed from the currency, reducing 10 billion Zimbabwean dollars to one dollar. On 3 October 2008, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe suspended temporarily the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, halting electronic parallel market transfers, but it was reinstated on 13 November 2008.
After being introduced on 1 August 2008, the third dollar continued to devalue.
An overview of the exchange rate data can be found in the table below :
Devaluation of the fourth dollar.
On 2 February 2009, the RBZ removed 12 zeros from the currency, with 1,000,000,000,000 (third) Zimbabwe dollars being exchanged for 1 new (fourth) dollar. Although the dollar was later abandoned on 12 April 2009, exchange rates were maintained at reasonable intervals for some time.

Milo Ventimiglia

Milo Anthony Ventimiglia (, ; born July 8, 1977) is an American actor best known for his role as Peter Petrelli on the NBC television series "Heroes". Ventimiglia's first career break was in the Fox series "Opposite Sex", playing Jed Perry, the main protagonist of the show. Ventimiglia was first noticed by fans during his three-year stint on the WB series "Gilmore Girls", playing Rory Gilmore's love interest Jess Mariano from 2001 until his final guest appearance in 2006.
After his own WB series "The Bedford Diaries", a recurring role as Meg Pryor's love interest on NBC's "American Dreams", and playing Rocky Balboa's son in the sixth and final installment of the Rocky series, "Rocky Balboa", Ventimiglia's big break came in 2006 when he received the part of nurse-turned-superhero Peter Petrelli for four seasons on NBC's "Heroes". He stars as Ian Mitchell in the Crackle original series "Chosen".
Early life.
Ventimiglia was born in Anaheim, California, the son of Carol (née Wilson) and Peter Ventimiglia. His father is of Sicilian descent and his mother has English, Irish, Scottish, French, and Cherokee Native American ancestry. His last name, Ventimiglia, meaning "twenty miles", is the name of the town of Ventimiglia in Liguria, Italy, which later gave its name to another city, Ventimiglia di Sicilia, and is derived from the fact that the members of his family claim descent from a branch of the medieval Italian nobility. The youngest of three children, he has two older sisters, Leslie and Laurel. He explained in an interview with "USA Today" that his "crooked mouth" is a result of dead nerves on the left side, which cause that side to remain immobile, much like, incidentally, actor Sylvester Stallone, with whom he worked in "Rocky Balboa".
Ventimiglia attended El Modena High School in Orange, California, where he wrestled, acted in drama productions and held the office of president in student government. He graduated in 1995. At eighteen years of age, Ventimiglia studied at the American Conservatory Theater for their summer program. He attended UCLA as a theatre major before getting a scholarship to a music school in San Francisco.
Career.
Acting.
At 18 years of age, Ventimiglia started auditioning, booking jobs, and working his way up. His first starring role was as a gay teenager in "Must Be the Music", a short film released as part of Strand Releasing's "Boys Life 2". From there, Ventimiglia studied at UCLA before landing a role on "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air". Ventimiglia has also guest starred on such television series as ', "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch", ' and "Boston Public." He had the part of the main character, Jed Perry, in the short-lived FOX TV series, "Opposite Sex". Milo also played a key role in an Apple advert for the Apple iBook.
From 2001 to 2004, Ventimiglia played brooding teen Jess Mariano on "Gilmore Girls"; he was introduced in the second season as a main cast member. In season four he dropped down to a guest star/recurring cast member, and he came back for two episodes in season six. He signed on for a spin-off of "Gilmore Girls," entitled "Windward Circle," which was going to be focused on the relationship between Jess and his estranged father (played by Rob Estes), but the proposed series never made it to air because of high filming costs. The season 3 episode "Here Comes the Son" was the pilot for the California-set spin-off, which would have starred Ventimiglia, Rob Estes and Sherilyn Fenn.
In the third and final season of the NBC drama "American Dreams", Ventimiglia played Chris Pierce, the rebellious boyfriend of Meg Pryor (Brittany Snow). Pierce and his single mother, Shelly (Daphne Zuniga), a Playboy bunny, move into the house next to the Pryors. Chris Pierce evades the draft, fearing he will be forced to fight in the Vietnam War, where Meg Pryor's older brother, J.J. (Will Estes) was wounded. Chris and Meg escape Philadelphia in the series finale to Berkeley, California, much to the sadness of Meg's best friend, Roxanne Bojarski (Vanessa Lengies).
In 2005, he starred in the mid-season replacement series "The Bedford Diaries," for which he did not have to audition. The producers had only Ventimiglia in mind for the role. However, the show lasted only eight episodes and was one of several shows not picked up by the newly formed network The CW. During his off-time from television and production work, he has had supporting roles in horror films such as "Cursed" and "Stay Alive" as well as starring roles in the short-film "Intelligence" and the full-length feature "Dirty Deeds". Most recently, he played Robert "Rocky Jr." Balboa, the son of Rocky Balboa, in the latest "Rocky" installment "Rocky Balboa" which was released in December 2006. Coincidentally, in the 2004 Gilmore Girls episode, ""Nag Hammadi Is Where they Found the Gnostic Gospels"", Lorelai Gilmore refers to Milo's character, Jess, as being able to "pull off an extremely convincing 'Adrian'", a reference likening Jess to Rocky Balboa.
In his biggest role to date, he starred as Peter Petrelli in the NBC program "Heroes", a show about "ordinary" people discovering they have superpowers. Alongside his work in "Heroes," Ventimiglia has also taken on other projects. In mid-2007 he starred as the love interest of pop/R&B singer Fergie in the music video for "Big Girls Don't Cry". In 2008, he starred in the horror film "Pathology." The movie co-starred "Charmed" actress Alyssa Milano and was directed by Marc Schoelermann for MGM.
After working with writers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor on "Pathology", Ventimiglia appeared in the pair's next film, "Gamer". He has called Neveldine and Taylor the "next big thing" in filmmaking and immediately agreed to play the part of Rick Rape in the futuristic thriller. When describing Rick Rape, Ventimiglia said that "Moonraker, silver grill, with a latex outfit making him look like a bumblebee. With the perverse nature of a teenage boy on speed." Ventimiglia also starred in the Xavier Gens apocalypse thriller film "The Divide".
He was the voice of Wolverine in the English dub of the "Marvel Anime: Wolverine" anime series and reprised his role in an episode of the "Marvel Anime: Iron Man" and an episode of "Marvel Anime: Blade". He did not return to voice Wolverine in "Marvel Anime: X-Men", due to that series portraying an older Wolverine, instead Wolverine was voiced by Steven Blum. Ventimiglia has been cast in Frank Darabont's pilot "L.A. Noir" for TNT as Ned Stax, a former marine.
Production work.
In addition to being hired as a second unit director for the 2003 and 2004 "Image Campaigns" for the former WB Network, Divide Pictures (the production company he co-owns and operates with best friend Russ Cundiff), Ventimiglia is now producing and developing a mini web-series called "It's a Mall World" as part of a marketing campaign for American Eagle Outfitters. The webisodes are due to start airing on American Eagle's official, during episodes of the new season of MTV's "The Real World", and in American Eagle stores nationwide on August 2. According to American Eagle's website, Ventimiglia will be directing the series, while his friend Cundiff will be producing it.

In addition to t-shirt production, Divide Social Club also produces "internet content" in the form of videos that have appeared on YouTube.
Ventimiglia, Russ Cundiff and Divide Pictures partnered with Top Cow to produce the comic series REST which will be a monthly limited series. The comic is about John Barret, a white-collar New Yorker whose life changes when he becomes addicted to a drug that prevents him from falling asleep. Divide also has a comic book called Berserker written by Rick Loverd.
Ventimiglia will co-produce and appear in "Ultradome," a web series which will debate the comparative merits of science fiction characters. The project is a collaboration between Agility Studios and Ventimiglia's DiVide Pictures. In the first episode, Ventimiglia will argue in favor of "Lord of the Rings"' superiority over Star Wars.

Mzoli's

Mzoli's (also known as Mzoli's Palace, Mzoli's Meat, or Mzoli's Butchery) is a butchery in Gugulethu, a township on the outskirts of Cape Town, South Africa. Since Mzoli's opened in early 2003, the restaurant has become a popular gathering spot for Cape Town residents and a tourist attraction. Amongst Gugulethu's residents, Mzoli's Place has a reputation for public drunkenness and disrespect for the local community. Mzoli's is named after the founder and owner, Mzoli Ngcawuzele.
History.
The establishment opened in early 2003. Owner Mzoli Ngcawuzele obtained start-up funding from the Development Bank of South Africa, which supports black-owned businesses. In October 2006, an economic study said that Mzoli had "moved, from selling meat informally from a garage, to owning one of the most popular hangouts in Cape Town".
In November 2006, more than 30 restaurant patrons, including a group of tourists and Democratic Alliance councillor Masizole Mnqasela, were arrested in a police raid for drinking in public. The restaurant did not sell alcohol, but Ngcawuzele explained that he could not stop people from bringing their own. The incident generated controversy in the local press. Tour operator Ryan Hunt claimed that police swore at the patrons and threatened people for asking questions. "The police created a dangerous situation. People are always encouraged to visit township attractions, but now they are turned away with that kind of situation," he said. Mnqasela, a member of Cape Town's economic development committee, added, "Mzoli's is internationally acclaimed and is key to township tourism. What kind of message are the police sending?" The African National Congress approved the police actions, citing a need to curtail public drunkenness.
Business.
Located in the township of Gugulethu, a black neighbourhood 15 kilometres southeast of the centre of Cape Town, Mzoli's is a "do-it-yourself" market and eatery, selling meat to patrons who in turn hire independent entrepreneurs running braai stalls on the grounds to grill the meat and prepare meals. Mzoli's also provides live entertainment and has become noted as a venue for deep house and kwaito music.
As well as local people, Mzoli's attracts television stars, DJs such as DJ Fresh, politicians such as Tony Yengeni, businesspeople, tourists, and college students. Mzoli's is considered to be a "base camp" where "black diamonds" gather and network. In September 2006, Sasha Planting of "Financial Mail" called it "the destination for everyone".
Reception by locals.
Some local residents near a long-planned shopping mall that is being built by a business partly owned by Mzoli's owner criticized his plans in 2008. Some businesses were legally evicted or threatened with eviction from older buildings owned by Mzoli, which were then knocked down to make room for the new property development. Other nearby residents have complained that the property developer has not hired enough local residents. Critics threatened to vandalize or burn both Mzoli's and Ngcauwezele's home if he did not meet their demands for jobs and permanent, guaranteed space for informal traders at the new shopping mall.

Serious Sam

Serious Sam is the first video game (released in two episodes) in the "Serious Sam" series. It is a first-person shooter (with third-person shooter options) created by the Croatian development house Croteam. Originally released for the PC market only, "Serious Sam"s rising popularity resulted in the porting of the series to a number of different platforms, including the Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox Live Arcade, among others.
The series follows the adventures of protagonist Sam "Serious" Stone and his fight against the forces of the notorious extraterrestrial overlord Mental who seeks to destroy humanity.
Gameplay.
Enemies spawn frequently and attack in large waves from across the map, and the player is intended to dodge their projectiles and charges by jumping and strafing rather than by taking cover. Health and armour are non-regenerative, and instead are topped up with the health and armour packs which are littered throughout the game. Available health is represented by a percentage number on the screen. The combat is high-paced and frenetic: The levels typically consist of a series of elaborate arenas, in which the player will defeat a set number of re-spawning enemies before proceeding to the next. Enemies range from soldiers with rocket launchers to gigantic charging robots to shrieking suicide bombers without heads and holding bombs. The environments include alien planets, ancient Egyptian pyramids and tropical rainforests.
Serious Sam features cooperative gameplay through a split-screen mode and via the internet.
Episodes.
Serious Sam consists of three episodes: "Serious Sam: The First Encounter", "Serious Sam: The Second Encounter", and the fan-made level-pack "Dark Island". A release, entitled Serious Sam: Gold Edition featured all the contents of "The First Encounter", "The Second Encounter" and "Dark Island". The games are on separate CDs (in the UK version) and are identical to their individual releases, except that the Sam character model for "The First Encounter" was modified to match the one used in "The Second Encounter".
"Serious Sam: The First Encounter".
The First Encounter was the first game in the series; it had been in the making since 1996 and had a video showing its early game play in 2000. "The First Encounter" was originally developed by Croteam as a demonstrator for their engine and this is the reason why some countries saw its initial release priced at less than half the value of other games in the genre.
The game takes place after the events of "" and the introduction reveals what happened before the actual story took place. In ancient times, Earth was involved in a massive conflict between Mental, an evil extraterrestrial being who wants to rule the universe, and the Sirians, a technologically-advanced sentient alien race that left many of its artifacts to be discovered by humanity. In the 22nd century, Mental and his army of grotesquely, twisted monsters return to Earth intending to destroy humanity. The humans are quickly overwhelmed and driven back to Earth. As a last resort, humanity uses the "Time-Lock". This mysterious Sirian artifact contains the power to transport a single person back through a chosen point of time. Because of his bravery in fighting these monsters, Sam "Serious" Stone was chosen to use the Time-Lock in hopes that he will defeat Mental and change the course of history. As the game opens, Sam appears in Egypt. He travels from one Egyptian monument to the next, fighting against the monsters Mental sent after him along the way. During Sam's journey, Sam is able to find and activate a hidden Sirian communicator in the shape of an obelisk located in Luxor, which summons a Sirian starship to Earth from deep space. Sam rushes to the Great Pyramids of Giza in order to rendezvous with the starship, only to be cornered by Mental's general, Ugh Zan III. After defeating this giant, Sam then teleports himself onto the starship. While Sam is aboard the "SSS Centerprice", he leaves a phone message to Mental telling him that "he has a special delivery package for him" and sets a course to Sirius, the Sirian homeworld.
"Serious Sam: The Second Encounter".
The Second Encounter starts where the previous game left off, with Sam traveling to Sirius on the SSS Centerprice. Unfortunately, the starship is accidentally hit by the "Croteam crate-bus" and plummets down to Earth's surface. As the starship falls, Sam reads the coordinates and frets about crash-landing into Egypt again, but instead he crashes into Central America in the Mayan age, with the starship now heavily damaged upon impact. However, not all hope is lost, since the Sirians left a "back-up starship" on Earth, which was a fail-safe in case if anything ever happens to the SSS Centerprice. However, since this back-up starship is located in a different time and age than where and when Sam is currently in, he will have to uncover the locations of the Sirian portals that will help him reach his destination. With this new objective, Sam storms through Mesoamerica, then travels to Mesopotamia and finally to Medieval Europe where the back-up starship is located. During his journey, Sam battles two of Mental's portal guardians: a powerful, Mayan spirit named Kukulkan the Wind God and a biomechanical creature called the Exotech Larva. Finally, in front of the Cathedral of Sacred Blood, Sam confronts the last obstacle to overcome on his path to the Holy Grail, Mordekai the Summoner. After a glorious battle with Mordekai and his spawning minions, The Summoner is finally silenced forever. In the Cathedral, Sam lifts the Holy Grail in the palms of his hands, followed by his confessions of his sins in a booth to Mental, during which he reassures Mental that "he's coming to get him." During the end credits, Sam activates the back-up starship, which turns out to be a rocket, and travels back into space toward Sirius, with the "Croteam Big-Heads" cheering him on. The story continues on to "Serious Sam II". 
Other than the more varied locations, "The Second Encounter" features some additional weapons—a chainsaw, a flamethrower, a sniper rifle, and the powerful Serious Bomb—and a number of new monsters that Sam has to face. This game has also seen the release of a level-pack titled Dark Island, featuring fan-made levels for single and multiplayer mode.
"The Second Encounter" soundtrack featured three instrumental songs from the Croatian heavy-metal band Undercode:
1. Freedom
2. As Above, So Below
3. Enlightening the World
"Dark Island".
"Dark Island" is a fan-made level-pack for "Serious Sam" that was released officially as part of Serious Sam: Gold Edition.
Remakes.
Palm OS.
In November 2001, Global Star announced the completion of a Palm OS version of "The First Encounter", to be released in early December. The game included 15 levels, and came in both color and monochrome. The release was developed by InterActive Vision.
Xbox.
The Xbox edition of Serious Sam had notable differences including the model of Sam being changed from the model of "The First Encounter" to form a more cartoon style Sam, removing the shades to make him look less like Duke Nukem and more like he does today. The Xbox version includes all of the levels from both of the PC games. As a result, weapons from "The Second Encounter" were added to the levels that were part of "The First Encounter" on PC. The levels were made smaller by removing the areas outside of the playing area. Unlike the PC version, you can't exit too far out of the playing area. This is due to the smaller amount of memory available in the Xbox. The gameplay was given a more arcade touch. A life system was implemented into the Singleplayer game making use of the score. Every 100,000 points grants the player a new life, which allows respawning at the place of death rather than at a save point. Combo points were added for killing multiple enemies at the same time, which allows the player to increase his/her score at a fast pace. Further changes to the game include the addition of treasure and the tweaking of save points. Save points are designated by a red phone booth. Autoaiming was also added to the Xbox version to compensate for the degree of control usually offered by a keyboard and mouse setup.
HD.
The game was remade using Serious Engine 3. It features updated visuals, models, and lush environments in high definition. Along with improved textures and character models, the remake features 16-player online co-op (4-player in the XBLA version), deathmatch, dedicated servers, and achievements. A new game mode, titled "Co-op Tournament" was introduced in this remake. 
The remake of the first episode Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter was released on 24 November 2009 for Windows PC through Steam, and on January 13, 2010 for Xbox 360.
The remake of the second episode Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter was released on April 28, 2010 for Windows PC and on September 22, 2010 for Xbox Live. On January 14, 2011. The Fusion DLC for the game which merges both "The First Encounter" and "The Second Encounter" was released on February 23, 2011, this DLC is free for those who own both (Steam) encounters on the PC. A new piece of DLC for "The Second Encounter" was released on Steam on May 15, 2012; Titled "Legend of the Beast", it contains new maps for the Survival and Multiplayer modes, and new campaign missions.
Development.
Croteam created their own engine for use in both "The First Encounter" and "The Second Encounter". Named the "Serious Engine", it is designed to cope with extremely large view distances and massive numbers of models, unlike most FPS engines which are developed for a limited draw distance and only a few animating models (i.e. enemies) on screen at a time. The Serious Engine is very efficient, capable of maintaining dozens of moving enemies (often stampedes) and enormous enemies, even on a modest system challenging the well known "id Tech", "Unreal" or "Source" engines. The "Serious Engine" can render through both Direct3D or OpenGL and, while it does not support pixel or vertex shaders, it is optimised for Direct3D 7's hardware transformation, clipping and lighting. The "Serious Engine" is available for licensing from Croteam.
A more powerful iteration of the "Serious Engine" was developed for use in "Serious Sam II" and is known as "Serious Engine II". It supports many features of modern GPUsx such as pixel and vertex shaders, HDR, bloom and parallax mapping.
Serious Engine 3 was used in "Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter" and "Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter". It includes detailed shading, and enemies are completely remodeled to look more realistic. This engine is also being developed to harness the full capacity of HDR and High Definition mapping. An updated version, Serious Engine 3.5, is used in "Serious Sam 3".
Serious Sam is voiced by John J. Dick.
Reception.
"The First Encounter" was the recipient of various editorial and consumer praise, with an overall 83% review ratio on Game Rankings and 87% on Metacritic as of May 25, 2012. It was the recipient of several major awards from the media, including Game of the Year.
"The Second Encounter" was also met with critical acclaim, with an overall 84% review ratio on Game Rankings and 85% on Metacritic as of May 25, 2012.

Murder Prevention

Murder Prevention was a British police drama inspired by the real-life Homicide Prevention Unit within the Metropolitan Police. It was produced for Five by World Productions who previously produced the television series The Cops. The series consisted of three two-part stories. Later repeats edited the two-parters so that they were screened as three longer running episodes.
According to series creator Declan Croghan, "Murder Prevention is the first pre-crime drama ever, anywhere."
Overview.
The series followed the work of the fictitious Murder Prevention Unit (MPU) as they attempted to prevent murders from taking place. By using modern scientific techniques and basic police instinct, the unit's aim was to gather enough evidence of intent to kill in order to arrest potential murderers.

Gymnothorax pictus

Gymnothorax pictus is a moray eel whose common names are peppered moray and paintspotted moray. The Chamorro name of the eel is "títugi".
Description.
The species is pale and has purplish specklings. The specklings gather together with age. When the species is young, the species have no spots or bars. The young are pale purplish with a white belly. The maximum length of the species is 140 centimeters. The species eat small fish and crustaceans. The species is similar to " Gymnothorax griseus". While hunting for prey, the species may be completely out of the water or they may leap out of water. The species is dangerous to eat because they are poisonous.
Taxonomy.
The species was named and described by Solander in an unpublished manuscript. Richardson said that the fish might be "Muraena siderea". Richardson later proved that the fish were different by pointing out the difference in coloration. When the names were published as separate species, it was unknown if they were really different species. The name that Kuep gave "Gymnothorax pictus" was "Sidera pantherina". Blecker later changed the name to its current name. The reason why the name is still the same is because of all three people's work.
Habitat.
The species can commonly be found in tropical marine waters of the Indo-Pacific and from islands of the tropical Eastern Pacific. The species can also be found in very shallow water on reef flats. Places that the species have been found at include Suva Reef, the Fiji Islands, Clarion Island, and the Revillagigedo Islands.

Holly Lerski

Holly Lerski (born Holly Elmhirst, 13 November 1969) is an English singer and songwriter known both for her work with Angelou and for her solo career.
Biography.
Coming to public attention in the late 1990s with folk rock band Angelou (band) this Norfolk based singer-songwriter has earned comparisons to Jeff Buckley and Beth Orton. Her music has also been featured in the American TV show "Close to Home" and the indie film "Fish Without a Bicycle", starring Jenna Mattison, Brian Austin Green and Jennifer Blanc.
Lerski was born in London, daughter of a sound engineer and ex-St Martins School of Art student. She grew up around music, and began playing guitar at the age of 6.
When she was 9 her family relocated to Norfolk. It was in this transitional period, with the aid of her 'Beatles Complete' book, Lerski first began to write songs. Lerski played bass and guitar in various bands throughout her teens and whilst studying at Art School. Upon graduation she joined folk rock band The Rainbyrds, and began songwriting and performing again.
Music career.
Lerski formed Angelou with guitarist Jo Baker in 1996. They recorded their first demo in the winter of that year, which included a cover of the Leonard Cohen song 'Hallelujah'. Inspired by Jeff Buckley's version, Lerski had been a fan of Buckley's, corresponding with the artist. Local Norwich label Haven Records heard the demo and signed Angelou in the beginning of 1997, scheduling the release of the Hallelujah EP to coincide with a UK summer tour supporting Eddi Reader and Boo Hewerdine. 'Hallelujah' came out a week after Jeff Buckley's untimely death, ending the year on novelist Nick Hornby's 'Best of 97' compilation.
In 1998 Angelou released their first album 'Automiracles'. Now including drummer Phil Di Palma, the album was written by Lerski, and recorded in 10 days by producer Calum MacColl. The album featured guest vocals from Eddi Reader and Boo Hewerdine and received comparisons to The Sundays' debut 'Reading, Writing and Arithmetic'.
Their second album 'While You Were Sleeping', released in 2000, received further acclaim and established Lerski as one of the new crop of up and coming female folk artists. Written and produced by Lerski, and recorded in studio down-time, the album finished with a moving tribute to Jeff Buckley. Lerski went on to contribute this to the Buckley documentary 'Amazing Grace'.
In 2001 Spanish label El Diablo released an Angelou compilation called Midnight Witcheries. Now joined by new drummer Cath Evans and bassist Anne Richardson, this record allowed the band to be heard for the first time throughout Europe. They completed 2 extensive tours of Spain, appearing on national TV and radio. They also went on to release a further EP and 2 videos.
On hearing of their success abroad, UK music independent giant Sanctuary Records offered Lerski a recording and publishing agreement and at the end of 2001 Lerski finally signed a major deal. Angelou were soon off on the road again, this time as a duo touring Scandinavia and Europe with blues legend John Hiatt & The Goners.
On their return from Europe the band went into rehearsals for the third album, staying in a wooden hunting lodge in Derbyshire. Recorded both in Denmark and Manchester throughout 2002, 'Life Is Beautiful' was a much poppier record. It was finally released in 2003 under Lerski's own name. With the launch of the album came lives dates with The Cranberries, Jason Mraz and Josh Rouse, and support from BBC Radio 2 and most notably Wake Up To Wogan producer Paul Walters. There was also news that Lerski's song 'My Love' would be featured in a Hollywood film. It looked like the bands hard work had finally paid off, however it was not to be. In 2004 after disagreements with Sanctuary over lack of promotion for the record, Lerski was forced to leave the label and her songs behind.
In the summer of 2004, tired of the music industry and following a break up, Lerski relocated to Manchester where she began to write new material with the intention of releasing on her own imprint Laundry Label. 'Greetings From N.Y.' was Laundry's first release. Featuring on the cover a hand written postcard to Lerski from Jeff Buckley, 'Greetings' was a 'best of' CD showcasing Lerski and the band's music to date. BBC Radio 2's Wake Up To Wogan once again championed the record and 'More Than A Storm' featured weekly on his show. Starbucks at the time was also featuring tracks from 'Life Is Beautiful' on their in-store compilation. 
By 2006, following the news that Sanctuary had been bought out by Universal Music Group, Holly returned to Norwich to begin a new chapter.
Solo career.
Going it alone now, Lerski played her first solo date in New York's famous 'Living Room' in 2007. That same week 'Hallelujah' was featured in the finale episode of CBS TV drama 'Close To Home'.
In September 2009 Lerski announced the launch of her own label, Laundry Label. She continues to write and record songs for her next album.
'My Love' will be featured in the new Jennifer Blanc Biehn/Michael Biehn film "Treachery", set for release in 2013.

For example, software directs machines coming onto the network via wireless access points to a portal where they present credentials. Guest users are required to go through a virtual LAN that provides limited access. Identity-based wireless access is used for “guest sponsorship” for partners, guests and employees. Enterprise users access the network through any standard browser. 
Site-to-site SSL VPN connectivity (“SiteDirect”) eliminates network exposure and limits access to specific applications or subnets.
Remote Desktop Access.
For remote desktop access and control, DesktopDirect allows users to remote desktops from a standard web browser. DesktopDirect can remotely boot up PCs that are in the “off” or “standby” states.
To access a remote desktop, self-registration starts with a user in the office, sitting at the PC that will be controlled remotely. The user browses to a specific URL to access the registration portal. The user logs in upon seeing a prompt for credentials, enters the hostname and description of the desktop PC, and registration is complete.
Remote control of the office PC starts with the user sitting away from the office, at a remote PC. The user browses to a specific URL, known as an access portal, and again logs in upon a prompt for credentials. A list of registered office PCs is then displayed, so the user can select which office PC to view and control. The user then logs into and controls the office PC. 
This is possible from any browser and Internet-attached computer. DesktopDirect only delivers the presentation layer remotely. This minimizes bandwidth consumption and increases support for concurrent users.
Application Delivery Controllers and Server Load Balancers.
The Array Networks (AppVelocity) APV Series consists of Application Delivery Controllers for SSL acceleration, load balancing and traffic management at layers 2- 7 for enterprise data centers and Web sites. The APV Series is available on a variety of platform sizes, uses 60% less power and cuts response time by 50%.
In 2009, Array launched an upgraded application delivery controller for enterprises and service providers using Web 2.0 applications, multimedia services and hosted cloud-centric applications.
