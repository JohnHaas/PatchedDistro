James Whitfield Williamson

James Whitfield Williamson (June 12, 1925 – November 15, 2008) was a businessman and politician from north Caddo Parish in northwestern Louisiana, the scion of a prominent political family. He was the mayor of the town of Vivian from 1972 to 1986, a Vivian Town Council member from 1958 to 1972, and a one-term member of the Caddo Parish Commission from 1988 to 1992, all elected positions also previously held by his father, Earl Guyton Williamson, Sr. (1903–1992).
Early years, family, military, business.
Williamson was born in Belcher in Caddo Parish to Earl Williamson and the former Mamie Greer (1904–1948), both Mississippi natives. He graduated from Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, having majored in speech and attended on a tennis scholarship. An avid sportsman, Williamson in 1987, at the age of sixty-two, won a silver medal in tennis at the Louisiana State Senior's Tournament. During World War II, he was a scout and sniper in the United States Marine Corps, Second Battalion in the South Pacific. He participated in the invasions of the islands of Guam and Iwo Jima and secured a Battlefield Commendation.
With his brother, Earl Jr. (born 1923), Williamson owned an automobile dealership in Vivian. He was a former member of the board of Citizen's Bank and Trust Company and a past president of the Vivian Lions Club. He was the commander of the local American Legion and a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Kiwanis Club, and the Monterey Country Club. He was a deacon of the First Baptist Church of Vivian, where he also taught the men's Bible class over an extended period of time.
Political campaigns.
In 1972, Williamson succeeded Jimmy Wilson as mayor after Wilson was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives. During his mayoral tenure, Williamson served as vice-president of the Louisiana Municipal Association. In 1986, Williamson was unseated for a fourth full term by the Republican construction businessman, Richard John "Rick" McMillan. II (born 1951). McMillan was reelected in 1990 with 58 percent of the vote and was unopposed in 1994. Midway in his third term, McMillan resigned and was succeeded by fellow Republican Raymond L. Lee (born September 30, 1935), who polled 62 percent of the ballots in a special election held on April 5, 1997. Lee later moved to Blanchard. When Lee resigned after a year in the position, the town council called Willamson out of retirement to serve as interim mayor for a number of months. Like his father, who was tied politically to the Earl Long faction in Louisiana politics, Williamson was a Democrat. Two other brothers who went into politics, Don W. Williamson and Tedford Williamson, however, are Republicans.
A year after Williamson lost his 1986 race for mayor, he ran for the Caddo Parish Commission (created in 1984) for the District 1 seat vacated by his fellow Democrat Roy M. Hopkins, who was elected to succeed the Republican Bruce Lynn in the Louisiana House. Williamson prevailed in a runoff with fellow Democrat Charles H. Caldwell, 1,535 votes (53.9 percent) to 1,314 (46.1 percent). In the primary on October 24, Williamson and Caldwell had nearly tied, and the Republican, Robert Chamberlain, was eliminated from contention. Williamson was unseated as commissioner after a single term in the general election held on November 16, 1991 by his fellow Democrat John D. "Johnny" Reid (born 1951) of Vivian. Williamson polled 3,018 votes (46.3 percent) to Reid's 3,500 ballots (53.7) in the same election in which Edwin Washington Edwards defeated David Duke for governor.
Death.
Williamson died at the age of eighty-three at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport. He was survived by his wife of fifty-nine years, the former Helen Hale (born 1929). The couple had no children. Other survivors included five brothers, Earl, Jr., and wife Alice of Vivian; former Louisiana State Senator Don W. Williamson and his wife, Rachel, of Shreveport; David Williamson and wife Darlene of Orange, Florida; Clayton Williamson and wife Elizabeth of Montgomery, Texas, and Ted Williamson and wife Connie of Round Rock, Texas; a sister, Jean Williamson Bright and husband, Delbert Bright, of Longview, Texas.
Services were held on November 18, 2008, at the First Baptist Church of Vivian. He is interred at Vivian Cemetery. Former Mayor Rick McMillan, Williamson's former political rival, was among the pallbearers.

<doc id="20686100" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20686100" title="Chile–Finland relations">
Chile–Finland relations

Chile–Finland relations are foreign relations between Chile and Finland. Chile recognised Finland's independence on June 17, 1919. Diplomatic relations between them were established in 1931 and have been continuously maintained, despite pressures at times to discontinue them. The two countries maintain resident ambassadors in both capitals.
Diplomatic relations.
Finland's first non-resident ambassador to Chile was G.A. Gripenberg, resident in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who was appointed ambassador after diplomatic ties were established on February 20, 1931. Until 1991 Finland was represented in Chile through its embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Finland has an embassy in Santiago de Chile, three honorary consulates in Antofagasta, Concepción and Punta Arenas. Permanent representation at a subambassadoral level was first established in the early 1970s.
Initially Chile was represented in Finland through its embassies in Stockholm, Sweden and Oslo, Norway. Lucio Parada Dagnino was appointed resident ambassador in 1991 and Chile opened an embassy in Helsinki in 1991. 
Diplomatic relations were maintained throughout World War II despite Finland being allied with the Axis Powers. The 1973 Chilean coup d'état and the Pinochet dictatorship brought pressures in both countries to cut off diplomatic ties. Relations were improved following Chilean transition to democracy.
Under Salvador Allende Chile had maintained diplomatic relations with the socialist countries of Eastern Europe, including the German Democratic Republic. After the 1973 Chilean coup these relations were severed. Finland was entrusted with the responsibility of representing the East German interests in Chile.
State visits.
Three of the four post-Pinochet Chilean presidents have made state visits Finland, Patricio Aylwin visited Finland in 1993, Ricardo Lagos in 2002 and Michelle Bachelet in 2007. Finnish presidents have made two state visits to Chile, Martti Ahtisaari visited Chile in 1997 and Tarja Halonen in 2003, also attending the inauguration of president Ricardo Lagos in March, 2000.
Economic cooperation.
Direct communication links between Finland and Chile were first established around 1850, when Finnish "Sitka clippers" started serving Russian America and Kamchatka, with regular stops in Valparaiso.
Economic ties between Chile and Finland center around copper and forestry. Chile is the world leader in copper production while Finland has been the world leader in copper smelting en extracting technology. Flash smelting was developed in Finland by Outokumpu in the late 1940s and is now the standard process for refining sulfur-containing ores. Outokumpu has provided technology to the Chilean copper industry from the 1960s and owned 50% of a copper mine in Zadivar. Other companies serving the Chilean mining industry include Metso, Tamrock and Larox and Outotec, formerly the technology division of Outokumpu.
In the early 2000s Outokumpu was a prospective partner for National Copper Corporation, Codelco in its $1 billion venture to build a copper smelter and refinery in the port city of Mejillones to handle ore from the Chuquicamata mine. The venture was promoted by president Halonen's state visit in 2003.
In May 2009 the Finnish Stora Enso and Chilean Celulosa Arauco y Constitución announced a € 253 million deal that would make their joint venture the largest landowner in Uruguay.
In 1993, Finnish researchers were sent to Chile to collect data on logging operations, which began a continued relationship of Finnish-Chilean cooperation on forestry.
In 2003, both countries met several times to discuss business opportunities and "the Chilean economy and investment prospects to major Finnish companies".
Trade.
Chile is the second-largest Latin American trade partner for Finland, after Brazil, with its main import being copper ore, followed by fruits and wines. Chilean copper ore is the main source of foreign ore for the Outokumpu (now Boliden) refinery in Harjavalta. Finnish exports to Chile vary considerably from one year to year, because they are closely related to investments made by the mining and forestry industries in Chile.
Cultural ties.
The socialist Allende government was an inspiration for left-wing groups in Finland, including the Taistoists. The 1973 coup d'état brought to Finland the first wave of refugees from outside Europe and created a solidarity movement. A friendship society, Suomi-Chile-Seura was established in 1973 to support the refugees. Future president Tarja Halonen served as the chairwoman of the society in the 1980s and is its honorary chairman.
The International Commission of Enquiry into the Crimes of the Military Junta in Chile held multiple sessions in Finland, including its first session in 1974 in Dipoli, Espoo and its 4th session in 1976 at the Finlandia Hall in Helsinki.

Heinrich Theodor Menke

Heinrich Theodor Menke (24 May 1819 - 14 May 1892) was a German geographer who was a native of Bremen. He is remembered for his work in historical geography.
Menke studied theology and philology at the University of Bonn, and in 1842 received his doctorate at Halle with a dissertation on ancient Lydia. Afterwards he worked as a schoolteacher in Bremen, but soon became dissatisfied with this line of work, and undertook legal studies in Berlin and Heidelberg. After attaining his degree he practiced law in Bremen, and later Vegesack.
Throughout his life, Menke had an avid interest in geography, and via contact with Wilhelm Perthes (1783-1853) of the "Justus Perthes Geographische Anstalt" in Gotha, his primary vocational focus turned to edition and production of geographical atlases. In 1865 he published the third edition of Karl Spruner von Merz' "Atlas Antiquus", and later produced the heavily revised third edition of Spruner's atlas of medieval and modern history- "Hand-Atlas für die Geschichte des Mittelalters und die neueren Zeit" (1871-1880). Menke died in Gotha on 14 May 1892.
The island group Menkeøyane in the Svalbard archipelago is named in his honor.

<doc id="20686116" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20686116" title="Anti-Ukrainian sentiment">
Anti-Ukrainian sentiment

Anti-Ukrainian sentiment or Ukrainophobia is animosity towards Ukrainians, Ukrainian culture, language or Ukraine as a nation. It is widely present in Poland and in the former Soviet Union, mainly in the Russian Federation and in some parts of Eastern Ukraine.  Its opposite is Ukrainophilia.
Modern scholars define two types of anti-Ukrainian sentiment: one based on discrimination of Ukrainians based on their ethnic or cultural origin (similar to other manifestations of xenophobia and racism), and another based on the conceptual rejection of Ukrainians, Ukrainian culture and language as artificial and unnatural. At the turn of the 20th century, several authors supported an assertion that Ukrainian identity and language had been created artificially in order to undermine Russia. This argument has been promulgated by several conservative Russian authors.
Russian Empire.
The rise and spread of Ukrainian self-awareness around the time of the Revolutions of 1848 produced an anti-Ukrainian sentiment within some layers of society within the Russian empire. In order to retard and control this movement, the use of Ukrainian language within the Russian empire was initially restricted by official government decrees such as the Valuev Circular (July 18, 1863) and later banned by the Ems ukaz (May 18, 1876) from any use in print (with the exception of reprinting of old documents). Popularly the anti-Ukrainian sentiment was promulgated by such organizations as "Black Hundreds", which were vehemently opposed to Ukrainian self-determination. Some restrictions on the use of Ukrainian language were relaxed in 1905-1907. They ceased to be policed after the February Revolution in 1917.
Beside the Ems ukaz and Valuev Circular, there was a multiple number of other anti-Ukrainian sentiments starting from the 17th century after Russia was governed by the House of Romanovs. In 1720 Peter the Great issued an edict prohibiting to print books in the Ukrainian language and since 1729 all edicts and instructions were only in the Russian language. In 1763 Catherine the Great issued an edict prohibiting to give lectures in the Ukrainian language at the Kiev-Mohyla Academy. In 1769 the Most Holy Synod prohibits to print and use the Ukrainian alphabet book. In 1775 the Zaporizhian Sich was destroyed. In 1832 all studying at schools of the Right-bank Ukraine transitioned to exclusively Russian language. In 1847 the Russian government persecuted all members of the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius and prohibiting the better works of Taras Shevchenko, Panteleimon Kulish, Nikolay Kostomarov (Mykola Kostomarov) and others. In 1862 all free Sunday schools for adults in Ukraine were closed. In 1863 the Russian Minister of Interior Valuev decided that the Little Russian language (Ukrainian language) has never existed and could not ever more to exist. During that time in the winter of 1863-64 the January Uprising took place at the western regions of the Russian Empire that united peoples of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Next year in 1864 there has appeared the "Regulation about elementary school" which claimed that any teaching should be conducted in the Russian language. In 1879 the Russian Minister of Education Dmitry Tolstoy (later the Russian Minister of Interior) officially and openly stated that all people of the Russian Empire should be Russified. In 1880s were issued several edicts that prohibited education in the Ukrainian language at privately held schools, theatric performances in the Ukrainian language, any use of such language in official institutions as well as baptizing by Ukrainian names. In 1892 another edict prohibited translation from the Russian language to the Ukrainian language. In 1895 the Main Administration of Publishing prohibited printing children books in the Ukrainian language. In 1911 the resolution that was adopted at the 7th Congress of Noblemen in Moscow prohibited the use of any other languages than Russian. In 1914 the Russian government officially prohibited celebrations of the 100th Anniversary of Shevchenko birthday and posted gendarmes at the Chernecha Hill. The same year Nicholas II of Russia issued an edict on prohibition of the Ukrainian press.
Soviet Union.
Under Soviet rule in Ukraine, a policy of korenization was adopted after defeat of the Ukrainian People's Republic and initially supported Ukrainian cultural self-awareness. This policy was phased out in 1928 and terminated entirely in 1932 in favor of general Russification. 
In 1929 Mykola Kulish wrote a theatrical play "Myna Mazailo" where the author cleverly displays the cultural situation in Ukraine. There was supposedly no anti-Ukrainian sentiment within the Soviet government, which began to repress all aspects of Ukrainian culture and language as contrary to the ideology of Proletarian Internationalism. 
In 1930 in Kharkiv took place the Union for the Freedom of Ukraine process after which number of former Ukrainian politicians or their relatives were deported to the Middle Asia. The ethnical cleansing against the Ukrainian intelligentsia was never evaluated and is poorly documented. The contemporary historical reevaluations of that period are being accepted in hostile manner from the leadership of the Russian Federation at very least as non friendly (see 2009 Medvedev speech).
During the Soviet era, the population of Ukraine was reduced by the artificial famine called Holodomor in 1932-33 along with the population of other nearby agrarian areas of the USSR. 
Many prominent Ukrainians were labelled as nationalists or anti-revolutionaries, and many were repressed and executed as "enemies of the people".
In January 1944 during a session of Politbureau of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Stalin personally gave a speech "About anti-Lenin mistakes and nationalistic perversions in a film-tale of Alexander Dovzhenko "Ukraine in flames".
On July 2, 1951 the Communist newspaper Pravda published an article "On Ideological Perversions in Literature" in regards of the Volodymyr Sosyura's poem "Love Ukraine" where it stated the following: "This poem could have been signed by such foes of the Ukrainian people as Petliura and Bandera ... For Sosiura writes about Ukraine and the love of it outside the limits of time and space. This is an ideologically vicious work. Contrary to the truth of life, the poet sings praises of a certain ‘eternal’ Ukraine full of flowers, curly willows, birdies, and waves on the Dnipro."
Dobosh Affair or Arrested Kolyada.
Prior to the 50th Anniversary of the establishment of the USSR in 1972, KGB initiated a special operation on the neutralization of people with an explicit public opinion. The special operation led to mass pogroms of the opposing intelligentsiya and hundreds of arrests with more serious convictions. An announcement from the KGB of Ukrainian SSR was sent to the First secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine, comrade Shelest.
A former wife of Vyacheslav Chornovil, doctor Olena Antoniv decided to organize a vertep in Lviv and conducted some preparations to the event at her apartment at vulytsia Spokiyna, 13. Vertep was to be held "with Malanka" (participation of a goat) and Bountiful Evening. Among the participants of the vertep were Lyubomyra Popadyuk, Vasyl Stus, Olena Antoniv, Iryna Kalynets, Maria and Hanna Sadovski, Mykhailo and Olha Horyn, Stefania Shabatura, Marian Hatalo, Oleksandr Kuzmenko and many others. Photos of those events are kept at the National Museum "Prison at Lontskoho". Vasyl Stus sided with the Lviv vertep on December 31 right after arriving from Morshyn where he has been treated. After couple of days when visiting Kalynets family he gave them a collection of poetry "Winter trees" and an article about Tychyna "The epoch phenomena", while receiving back a vyshyvanka (decorated shirt).
KGB as in the best of its traditions sent numerous agents among the local population to help tracking and uncovering any anti-Soviet activities. One of the agents was an employee of the Museum of Folk Architecture in Pyrohove, Borys Kovhar, who sent a letter of confession to the KGB Major Danylenko. Kovhar, however, eventually sided with the dissidents, for which he paid by being sent to a psychiatric hospital.
In order to convict the vertep participants in more serious crimes than not following the Soviet atheistic principles and celebrating religious holidays, it was decided to connect the "nationalistic underground of Ukraine with the Ukrainian centers and organizations abroad". The "Dobosh Affair" was invented by the Soviet state security authorities where the lead role was given to a Belgian student of Ukrainian descent Yaroslav Dobosh. According to the scenario Dobosh intended to collect in Kiev and Lviv copies of samizdat, photocopies of "Ukrainian Herald" and take them abroad for the Ukrainian Relief Committee and Society of Ukrainian Youth, of which he was a member.
The day January 4, 1972 was the starting point in conducting operations against dissidents. Dobosh was not permitted to leave the Soviet Union when he was detained on a border in Chop, while also a copy of "Rhyme dictionary of Ukrainian language" from political prisoner Svyatoslav Karavansky was confiscated from him. The student was accused "in conducting subversive anti-Soviet activities". Notice of his arrest appeared only after 11 days in the newspaper of the Central Committee of Communist Party of Ukraine "Radyanska Ukrayina" (Soviet Ukraine).
The direct actions against opposition members started on January 12, 1972. One of the dissidents described the ominous day as following
After the conducted searches behind bars found themselves leaders of dissidents Ivan Svitlychny, Vasyl Stus, Yevhen Sverstyuk, Zinovia Franko, Leonid Seleznenko, Leonid Plyushch and others.
Soviet language policy in cinematography of Ukraine.
The biggest film studio of Ukraine, Dovzhenko Film Studios (Kiev), explicitly shows the Soviet language policy even during the so-called policy of "korenizatsiya". A simple analysis of all studio productions which accounts for some 378 films shows that 338 films (88.9%) were produced either completely in the Russian language or the Ukrainian language could be heard in few episodes or in folkloristic scenes (such as songs) to distinct Ukrainian region. Only 22 (5.8%) films were produced in the Ukrainian language and language production of another 14 (3.7%) films was difficult to evaluate, while 6 (1.6%) films were really bilingual (Russian-Ukrainian).
Other incidents.
About the fact of Russification were written numerous publications by number of academicians and literary specialists such as Nina Virchenko, Rostyslav Dotsenko, Mykhailyna Kotsiubynska (niece of Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky), and many others.
Ukraine.
On Sunday July 15, 2012 the national television broadcasting station in Ukraine First National in its news program "Weekly overview" () showed a video footage on a development of anti-Ukrainian sentiments within Ukraine.
Other Regions.
On February 24, 2009 Ihor Markov, a deputy of Odessa city council and leader of the pro-Russian organization " Rodina " — along with associates — beat up picketers who were protesting against raising of the monument of the Russian empress Catherine II in Odessa. Catherine II was the founder of the city of Odessa, but she is sometimes reviled in Ukraine for the destruction of Zaporizhian Host and for spreading serfdom to Ukrainian territory.
On April 17, 2009, Maksym Chaika, a 20-year old student of Odessa National University, was murdered in Odessa. Chaika was a member of "Sich", a patriotic youth movement in Ukraine. Some observers say that Chaika had openly criticized the pro-Russian activities of Markov, his party, Rodina, and the local TV channel ATB, which sympathizes with Markov. On April 24, 2009 during the TV-show Shuster-Live Markov called murdered Chaika neo-fascist and stated that Ukraine follows the same political route as the Nazi Germany. With the help from Mykolaiv city Prosecutor's Office Markov was able to evade any responsibilities.
A propaganda article posted on the website of the Kremenchuk department of the Communist Party of Ukraine argues that history that was published during the Soviet regime was the true history, and that new historical facts being uncovered from the archives are false. The article also denies the existence of the Ukrainian culture.
Mykola Levchenko, a Ukrainian parliamentarian from Party of Regions, and the deputy of Donetsk City Council states that there should be only one language, Russian. He says that the Ukrainian language is impractical and should be avoided. Levchenko called Ukrainian the language of folklore and anecdotes. However, he says he will speak the literary Ukrainian language on principal, once Russian is adopted as the sole state language. Anna German, the spokesperson of the same party, highly criticized those statements.
Mykhailo Bakharev, the vice-speaker of the Crimean Autonomous Republic parliament (and the main editor of Krymskaya Pravda), openly says that there is no Ukrainian language and that it is the language of the non-educated part of population. He claims that it was invented by Taras Shevchenko and others. He also believes that there is no Ukraine nation, there is no future for the Ukrainian State, and that Ukrainization needs to be stopped.
Volodymyr Rybak complained on March 14, 2013 that he is not permitted to speak in a foreign language in the Supreme Council of Ukraine.
On May 25, 2013 a resident of Kiev was beaten up simply for speaking in the Ukrainian language.
On May 27, 2013 the Kiev Administrative Court of Appeals rejected the appeal of Iryna Farion against the court decision in regards to ensure the Ukrainian translation of foreign language speeches in the Supreme Council of Ukraine - Verkhovna Rada.
Minister of Education of Ukraine.
The current Ukrainian Minister of Science and Education, Dmytro Tabachnyk, has sparked protests calling him anti-Ukrainian in some parts of Ukraine due to this statements about Western Ukrainians, his preference for the Russian language, and his denial of the Holodomor. Tabachnyk's view of Ukraine’s history includes the thesis that western Ukrainians aren’t really Ukrainian. In an article for the Russian newspaper "Izvestia" Tabachnyk wrote last year: “Halychany (western Ukrainians) practically don’t have anything in common with the people of Great Ukraine, not in mentality, not in religion, not in linguistics, not in the political arena” “We have different enemies and different allies. Furthermore, our allies and even brothers are their enemies, and their ‘heroes’ (Stepan Bandera, Roman Shukhevych) for us are killers, traitors and abettors of Hitler’s executioners.” By March 17, 2010 four of western Ukraine’s regional councils had passed resolutions calling for the minister’s dismissal. A host of civic and student organizations from all over the country (including Kherson in southern Ukraine and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine), authors and former Soviet dissidents also signed petitions calling for his removal. Tabachnyk also denies the Holodomor, considering it an invention of foreign historians for political motives. Tabachnik also had stated that Ukrainian history textbooks contained "simply false" information and announced his intention to rewrite them.
Shevchenko-phobia.
Shevchenkophobia is a variant of Ukrainophobia. According to Ivan Dzyuba, such sentiment appeared already in the beginning of the Taras Shevchenko's work. One of the most notable depiction of such sentiment today became publication of Oles Buzyna "Vuladak Taras Shevchenko", the goal of which is to discredit the Shevchenko's personality cult.
Russia.
In a poll held by Levada Center in June 2009 in Russia 75% of Russian respondents respected Ukrainians as ethnic group but 55% were negative about Ukraine as the state. In May 2009, 96% of Ukrainians polled by Kyiv International Sociology Institute were positive about Russians as ethnic group, 93% respected Russian Federation and 76% respected Russian establishment.
Some Russian media seem to try to discredit Ukraine. Media like Komsomolskaya Pravda seem to try to intensify the bad relationship between Ukraine and Russia. A series of Russian films used anti-Ukrainian slurs without any criticism from their government. Anti-Ukrainian attitude persists among several Russian politicians, such as the former mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, and the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and the Deputy Speaker of the Russian Parliament, Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Ukrainians form the third largest ethnic group in Russian Federation after Russians and Tatars. In 2006, in letters to Vladimir Putin, Viktor Yushchenko and Vasily Duma, the Ukrainian Cultural Centre of Bashkortostan complained of anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Russia, which they claim includes wide use of anti-Ukrainian ethnic slurs in the mainstream Russian media, television and film. The Urals Association of Ukrainians also made a similar complaint in a letter they addressed to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2000.
According to the Ukrainian Cultural Centre of Bashkortostan, despite their significant presence in Russia, Ukrainians in that country have less access to Ukrainian-language schools and Ukrainian churches than do other ethnic groups. In Vladivostok, according to the head of the Ukrainian government's department of Ukrainian Diaspora Affairs, local Russian officials banned a Ukrainian Sunday school in order not to "accentuate national issues"
According to the president of the Ukrainian World Congress in 2001, persistent requests to register a Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate or a Ukrainian Catholic Church were hampered due to "particular discrimination" against them, while other Catholic, Muslim and Jewish denominations fared much better. According to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, by 2007 their denomination had only one church building in all of Russia.
Some Russians mass-media continues their policy of turning the population of Ukraine against its government and trying to convince of non-existence of the Ukrainian culture, such as some Alexei Itsenkov from "Gazeta 2000" who posted his article under domain's name "litvin.com.ua". In his article Mr.Itsenkov gives an impression of being an expert of ethnography, implying that the Ukrainian ethnicity never existed and is simply an invention of the Motherland's deserters who emigrated to Poland, United States, and Canada. Interestingly that his name can also be traced to the pro-presidential website of the Russian Federation.
In 2008 Nikolai Smirnov released a documentary in which he claims that Ukraine is part of one whole Russia that was split away by different western powers such as Poland, particularly.
In November 2010, the High Court of Russia cancelled registration of one of the biggest civic communities of the Ukrainian minority, the “Federal nation-cultural autonomy of the Ukrainians in Russia” (FNCAUR). According to the author Mykhailo Ratushniy Ukrainian activists continue to face discrimination and bigotry in much of Russia.
Deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Konstantin Zatulin identifies Ukrainians as the Russians who live in Crimea.
The anchorman of a news program "Sunday Time" on the Channel One (Russia) Pyotr Tolstoi announced on July 8, 2012 about the enforced Ukrainization in Ukraine, 20 millions Russians, an invented genocide about Ukrainians, and the distortion of the Russian historiography.
Television.
State television company of Orenburg city portrays Taras Shevchenko as a Russophobian and an ungrateful poet of questionable status. It questions the reason to celebrate the birthday of Ukrainian national poet who was exiled to Orenburg.
Poland.
Anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Poland first became significant in the mid-17th century in the aftermath of the revolt led by Khmelnytsky in 1648. It continued with numerous outbursts during the Haydamak revolts of the 18th century.
The 20th-century anti-Ukrainian Stalinist actions such as Operation Vistula left a deep and endemic mark on the ethnic Ukrainians living within the Polish state.
Ukrainian organizations in Poland are disturbed by a new wave of anti-Ukrainian actions that have recently erupted such as those that appeared during the festival of Ukrainian culture in Poland in the border town of Przemyśl in 1995 where numerous threats against participants and numerous acts of vandalism took place. A rise in incidences of graffiti with anti-Ukrainian slogans, and the office of “Związek Ukraińców w Polsce” was set alight. In some cities anti-Ukrainian assaults, vandalism acts of an organized character have targeted centers of Ukrainian culture, schools, churches, memorials.
Polish publishing house Nortom was banned from the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2000, for selling anti-German and antisemitic books. Ukrainophobic and antisemitic authors (mainly interbellum Endecija activists) published by Nortom include: Roman Dmowski, Janusz Dobrosz, Jędrzej Giertych, Jan Ludwik Popławski, Maciej Giertych, Stanisław Jastrzębski, Edward Prus, Feliks Koneczny.
In 2000, Nortom was forced to withdraw its 12 controversial titles from the Frankfurt Book Fair by the Polish Ministry of Culture representative Andrzej Nowakowski overlooking the Polish exposition. Nortom was accused of selling anti-German, Anti-Ukrainian and antisemitic books, especially the following titles: "Być czy nie być" by Stanisław Bełza, "Polska i Niemcy" by Jędrzej Giertych and "I tak nie przemogą. Antykościół, antypolonizm, masoneria" by his son Maciej Giertych. As a result of the above request, the president of the Polish delegation Andrzej Chrzanowski from Polska Izba Książki decided to penalize Nortom by removing it from the 2000 book fair altogether.
Canada.
Anti-Ukrainian discrimination was present in Canada from the arrival of Ukrainians in Canada around 1891 until the late 20th Century. In one sense this was part of a larger trend towards nativism in English Canada during the period. But Ukrainians were singled out for special discrimination because of their large numbers, visibility (due to dress and language), and political activism. During the First World War, around 8,000 Ukrainian Canadian were interned by the Canadian government as "enemy aliens" (because they came from the Austrian Empire). In the interwar period all Ukrainian cultural and political groups, no matter what their ideology was, were monitored by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and many of their leaders were deported.
This attitude began to slowly change after the Second World War, as Canadian immigration and cultural policies generally moved from being explicitly pro-British to a more pluralistic foundation. Ukrainian nationalists were now seen as victims of communism, rather than dangerous subversives. Ukrainians began to hold high offices, and one, Senator Paul Yuzyk was one of the earliest proponents of a policy of "multiculturalism" which would end official discrimination and acknowledge the contribution of non-English, non-French Canadians. The Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism of the 1960s, which had originally been formed only to deal with French-Canadian grievances, began the transition to multiculturalism in Canada because of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's desire to court Ukrainian votes in Western Canada. The Commission also included a Ukrainian commissioner, Jaroslav Rudnyckyj.
Since the adoption of official multiculturalism under Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982, Ukrainians in Canada have had legal protection against discrimination.

The Legend of Wooley Swamp

"The Legend Of Wooley Swamp" is a song written, composed, and recorded by the Charlie Daniels Band. It was released in August 1980 as the second single from the album "Full Moon," which was later certified platinum.
Content.
The song tells a mythical ghost story, with the first verse relating the life of Lucius Clay, an elderly and greedy recluse who lives in a backwoods area of Wooley Swamp called Booger Woods. Clay cares about nothing except his money, which he keeps buried in Mason jars around the shack where he lives. According to the lyrics, Clay digs up his money "on certain nights if the moon is right" just to run his fingers through it.
The second (and longer) verse introduces the antagonists, the Cable Boys who live in nearby Carver's Creek; three young brothers described as mean and belligerent white trash. Jealous of Lucius Clay, the brothers plot to kill him, feed his corpse to the alligators and steal his money. Late one night, they sneak up on Clay in Booger Woods, who has just dug up "thirteen rusty mason jars" filled with money. The Cables then mercilessly beat him to death and joyously dump his body in the swamp. But when they grab the money from Clay's shack and attempt to escape they become trapped in quicksand. The boys scream for help and struggle to free themselves, but to no avail. Just before they meet their own doom, they hear Clay himself "laughin' in a voice as loud as thunder."
The final stanza of the second verse wraps up the story saying that, though the myth is fifty years old, on full moon nights "you can hear three young men screaming" while "you can hear one old man laugh."
Success and reception.
Although the song only went to number 80 on the "Billboard" country charts, it was major crossover hit on the U.S. pop charts as it entered the Top 40 on September 27, 1980 and later peaked at number 31. It receives occasional airplay to this day, and has become one of Daniels' signature songs.
Other versions.
Daniels re-recorded the song with the group Smokin' Armadillos on their 1996 self-titled album.

Biography.
Early life and career beginnings.
Raised in Harlem, New York, Charles Hamilton was exposed to music at an early age. "My mother was an entertainment journalist for the Cleveland Call and Post, so she would take me with her to events when I was just a baby." Hamilton stated his mother always made sure he had an instrument around him. His mother put different kinds of instruments in the basement of their Cleveland home, but he naturally gravitated to the keyboard. Hamilton has stated, "At first, I was just playing the rhythm of the songs I would hear... The older I got, the more proficient I got at hearing the notes." For most of his life, Hamilton was self-taught. Picking up the lead and bass guitar in his teenage years, as well as the drums and harmonica. Hamilton has stated that listening to other genres of music, being exposed to different cultures and experiencing life helped mold his musical sound. Utilizing a studio built in the Frederick Douglass Academy, Charles Hamilton has spent countless hours in the studio, developing his craft and his own signature sound. Hamilton stated, "The Lab (FDA's studio) means so much to me, because when I literally didn't have anywhere else to go in the world, I can just go into my beloved alma mater and purge myself creatively." The studio in the Frederick Douglass Academy is where most of Charles Hamilton's music is made. Hamilton has also stated, regarding FDA's studio, that " can do my thing in other studios. It's just something about home that makes my music breathe."
Hamilton met future manager Le'Roy Benros after offering to help with a music event that he was organising. When Benros eventually heard his music he was "blown away" and arranged a meeting at Hamilton's high school in Harlem. Benros set about promoting his first client in any way that he could, burning CDs, putting him on at showcases and securing his first appearance on the influential blog "You Heard That New". He also managed to introduce Hamilton to Theo Sedlmayr, one of the most powerful entertainment lawyers in the music industry.

Lobaria pulmonaria

Lobaria pulmonaria is a large epiphytic lichen consisting of an ascomycete fungus and a green algal partner living together in a symbiotic relationship with a cyanobacterium—a symbiosis involving members of three kingdoms of organisms. Commonly known by various names like tree lungwort, lung lichen, lung moss, lungwort lichen, oak lungs or oak lungwort, it is sensitive to air pollution and is also negatively affected by habitat loss and changes in forestry practices. Its population has declined across Europe and "L. pulmonaria" is considered endangered in many lowland areas. The species has a history of use in herbal medicines, and recent research has corroborated some medicinal properties of lichen extracts.
Description.
It is a foliose lichen and its leaf-like thallus is green, leathery and lobed with a pattern of ridges and depressions on the upper surface. Bright green under moist conditions, it becomes brownish and papery when dry. This species often has a fine layers of hairs, a tomentum, on its lower surface. The cortex, the outer protective layer on the thallus surface, is roughly comparable to the epidermis of a green plant. The thallus is typically in diameter, with individual lobes wide and up to 7 cm long. The asexual reproductive structures soredia and isidia are present on the thallus surface. Minute (0.5–1.5 mm in diameter) cephalodia—pockets of cyanobacteria—are often present on the lower surface of the thallus; these spots are conspicuously darker than the green surface of the thallus. Like other foliose lichens, the thallus is only loosely attached to the surface on which it grows.
Photobionts.
The thallus contains internal structures known as cephalodia, characteristic of three-membered lichen symbioses involving two photobionts (the photosynthetic symbionts in the fungal-algal lichen relationship). These internal cephalodia, found between the "ribs" of the thallus surface, arise when blue-green algae (from the genus "Nostoc") on the thallus surface are enveloped during mycobiont growth. Structurally, cephalodia consist of dense aggregates of "Nostoc" cells surrounded by thin-walled hyphae—this delimits them from the rest of the thallus which contains a loose structure of thick-walled hyphae. Blue-green cyanobacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen, enhancing nutrient availability for the lichen. The other photobiont of "L. pulmonaria" is the green algae "Dictyochloropsis reticulata".
Reproduction.
"L. pulmonaria" has the ability to form both vegetative propagation and sexual propagules at an age of about 25 years. In sexual reproduction, the species produces small reddish-brown discs known as apothecia containing asci, from which spores are forcibly released into the air (like ballistospores). Based on studies of ascospore germination, it has been suggested that "L. pulmonaria" spores use some mechanism to inhibit germination—the inhibition is lifted when the spores are grown in a synthetic growth medium containing an adsorbent like bovine serum albumin or α-cyclodextrin.
Dispersal by vegetative propagules (via soredia or isidia) has been determined as the predominant mode of reproduction in "L. pulmonaria". In this method, the protruding propagules become dry and brittle during the regular wet/dry cycles of the lichen, and can easily crumble off the thallus. These fragments may develop into new thalli, either at the same locale or at a new site after dispersal by wind or rain. A number of steps are required for the development of the vegetative propagules, including the degeneration of the thallus cortex, replication of green algal cells, and entanglement of fungal hyphae with the green algal cells. This steps lead to an increase in internal pressure which eventually breaks through the cortex. Continued growth leads to these granules being pushed upwards and out of the thallus surface.
Distribution and habitat.
It has a wide distribution in Europe, Asia, North America and Africa, preferring damp habitats with high rainfall, especially coastal areas. It is the most widely distributed and most common "Lobaria" species in North America. Associated with old-growth forests, its presence and abundance may be used as an indicator of forest age, at least in the Interior Cedar-Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone in eastern British Columbia. It is also found in pasture-woodlands. It usually grows on the bark of broad-leaved trees such as oak, beech and maple but will also grow on rocks. In the laboratory, "L. pulmonaria" has been grown on nylon microfilaments.
Various environmental factors are thought to affect the distribution of "L. pulmonaria", such as temperature, moisture (average humidity, rapidity and frequency of wet-dry cycles), sunlight exposure, and levels of air pollution. Attempts to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of these factors to lichen growth is difficult because differences in the original environment from which the lichen thalli are collected will greatly affect heat and desiccation tolerances.
Due to declining population, "L. pulmonaria" is considered to be rare or threatened in many parts of the world, especially in lowland areas of Europe. The decline has been attributed to industrial forestry and air pollution, particularly acid rain. "L. pulmonaria", like other lichens containing a blue-green algal component, are particularly susceptible to the effects of acid rain, because the subsequent decrease in pH reduces nitrogen fixation through inhibition of the algal nitrogenase enzyme.
Chemical compounds.
"L. pulmonaria" is known to contain a variety of acids common to lichens, such as stictic acid, desmethyl stictic acid, gyrophoric acid, tenuiorin, constictic acid, norstictic acid, peristictic acid, and methylnorstictic acid. These compounds, collectively known as depsidones, are known to be involved in defense against grazing herbivores like lichen-feeding molluscs. It also contains the sugar alcohols D-arabitol, volemitol, in addition to several carotenoids (total content > 10 mg/kg), such as alpha carotene, beta carotene, and beta cryptoxanthin. The upper cortex of the lichen contains melanins that screen UV and PAR radiation from the photobiont. The synthesis of melanin pigments in the lichen increases in response to greater solar irradiation, and shade-adapted thalli are greenish-grey in the air-dry state, while sun-exposed thalli can be dark brown in color. This adaptation helps protect the photosymbiont "D. reticulata", known to be relatively intolerant to high light levels.
Also known to be present are various steroids, namely ergosterol, episterol, fecosterol, and lichesterol.
Uses.
Medicinal.
Its shape somewhat resembles the tissue inside lungs and therefore it is thought to be a remedy for lung diseases based on the doctrine of signatures. The lichen's common English names are derived from this association. Gerard's book "The Herball or General Historie of plants" (1597) recommends "L. pulmonaria" as medicinally valuable. It is still used for asthma, urinary incontinence and lack of appetite. In India it is used as a traditional medicine to treat hemorrhages and eczema, and it is used as a remedy for coughing up blood by the Hesquiaht in British Columbia, Canada. An ethnophytotherapeutical survey of the high Molise region in central-southern Italy revealed that "L. pulmonaria" is used as an antiseptic, and is rubbed on wounds.
A hot-water extract prepared using this species has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and ulcer-preventing activities. Also, methanol extracts were shown to have a protective effect on the gastrointestinal system of rats, possibly by reducing oxidative stress and reducing the inflammatory effects of neutrophils. Furthermore, methanol extracts also have potent antioxidative activity and reducing power, probably due to the presence of phenolic compounds.
Other uses.
"L. pulmonaria" has also been used to produce an orange dye for wool, in the tanning of leather, in the manufacture of perfumes and as an ingredient in brewing.

Main Street, Letterkenny

Main Street () is an important thoroughfare in Letterkenny, County Donegal, Ireland. The longest street in Ireland, it is divided into two sections, with Lower Main Street running from the junction at Oldtown Road to the Market Square and Upper Main Street running from the Market Square to the junction at Crossview House. Traffic flows in a one-way system from Crossview House downwards. The road junctions on the street are:
History.
Theobald Wolfe Tone was captured and held on the street during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. He was held for a short time at Laird's Hotel opposite the Market Square before being transferred to the nearby Derry Gaol. The Wolfe Tone Bar was established in his honour and is located on Lower Main Street on the site of the old Garda barracks. The Barracks building had been there since the 1850s and was an RIC Barracks up to 1922.
Hiring Fairs were held in Letterkenny in years gone by when children between the ages of 11 and 16 were sold for periods of six months to wealthy farmers of the Lagan Valley. These Rabble Days were held annually in May and November at Speer's Lane, at the corner of Upper Main Street. The monument Rabble Children by Maurice Harron was erected at the Market Square in December 1994.
Regeneration works were carried out on Lower Main street in late 1996. Footpaths were widened and cobblestones were placed on the street at the junction with Larkin's Lane. These cobblestones were removed in 2008. The street was the main location of events when the town hosted the Fleadh Cheoil in 2005 and 2006. The Lower Main Street pavements have since fallen into a higgledy-piggledy bad state of repair which has led to calls from the local council for re-paving to be carried out.
Criminal activity.
The Main Street has seen numerous assaults, stabbings, sexual assaults, drug raids and attacks on Gardaí in the past.
In August 2009, the Lower Main Street was nearly blown-up when a severed gas pipe was discovered in an alleyway. The street was sealed off as the gas spread around the area. Occupants in nearby buildings were evacuated while attendants at the Wolfe Tone Bar were kept inside for fear of igniting the gas. A gas engineer later shut off the supply of gas from the meter.
In 2011, a Garda officer and three nightclub bouncers were repeatedly stabbed outside the Voodoo Nightclub. One of the bouncers had his leg penetrated by the blade while the Garda had his hand slashed.
Services.
Main Street once served as the main shopping area in the town but trade has now shifted further afield. The Main Street is still home to many older establishments including R.McCullagh Jewellers, dating from 1869, and Speers Department Store. It is also acts as the financial services centre of the town with the majority of banks being located there.
Today the street is a centre for popular night clubs such as Club Voodoo. It is a popular nightspot at weekends, being the location of many stag and hen parties. The street can become quite vicious in the early hours of the morning and this has led many local to steer clear. The area has seen numerous assaults, stabbings, sexual assaults, drug raids, and attacks on Gardaí in the past.
Shopping Centres.
The Courtyard Shopping Centre has an entrance close to the midpoint of Letterkenny's Main Street. Located in central Letterkenny, close to the Library and Arts Centre on the Lower Main Street side and the Bank of Ireland on the Upper Main Street side, it also overlooks Pearse Street and Oliver Plunkett Street. The structure is built spirally on a slope so, if approached from the Main Street entrance, the visitor, when making their way through the complex, descends into the ground via a series of escalators. Letterkenny's oldest Eason's bookstore and Heatons, the department store in which billionaire retail entrepreneur and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley has a 50% stake, are among the outlets to be found inside. Both Eason and Heatons are situated on multiple storeys.
The Market Centre is a small shopping centre located opposite the Market Square. It has a gathering of shops spread around a flat shopping mall.

James Brown (Northern Ireland politician)

James Brown (born 1897, date of death unknown) was a Unionist politician and journalist in Northern Ireland.
Brown stood as an independent Farmers and New Industries candidate in South Down at the Northern Ireland general election, 1938. The seat had previously elected Irish nationalists, but no nationalist candidate stood in 1938, and Brown easily beat his only opponent, a Northern Ireland Labour Party candidate. He immediately took the Ulster Unionist Party whip in Parliament.
At the Northern Ireland general election, 1945, Brown contested Mourne as an independent Unionist, but was defeated by the Nationalist Party candidate James McSparran. He then stood for Down at the 1945 Westminster general election. He came last out of four candidates, but took 19.1% of the vote and was less than 2,000 votes behind the last elected candidate.
A by-election was held in Down in 1946, and Brown again stood, this time as an independent "Democratic Unionist". He again placed last, his share of the vote shrinking to 2.2%.
Brown's final political contest was in South Down at the Northern Ireland general election, 1958. For the first time, he stood as an official Ulster Unionist Party candidate, but he was not able to regain the seat.

Mandra plays as a forward and began his career in the youth ranks of storied Argentine club Racing Club. He made his first appearance in the Clausura 1995 tournament. For the 1996–1997 season he was loaned out to second division side Nueva Chicago where he would net 15 goals in 27 appearances. He then returned to Racing but than would begin a series of moves to various clubs throughout the world. He joined Ferro Carril Oeste in 1998 where he was a prominent player netting 11 goals in 51 First Division matches. For the 1999–2000 season Mandra moved to Europe to Madrid club Rayo Vallecano. Mandra received little playing time for Rayo and moved to Greek side Paniliakos at the conclusion of the season. Mandra enjoyed success in Greece, he netted 6 goals in 23 matches. However, after one season in Greece he would return to Argentina to his former club Nueva Chicago, he enjoyed success at the club and than moved on to yet another club in his native land Rosario Central. After two successful seasons in Argentina, Mandra was recruited to play for 2. Bundesliga side FC Nuremberg. After two unhappy months in Germany, Mandra returned to Argentina. For the 2004 season Mandra would sign with Peruvian side Universidad San Martín, the club was in the middle of a battle to avoid relegation and Mandra's 5 goals in 18 appearances helped San Martin remain in the First Division.
Mandra continued with his career as a football nomad as he returned to Argentina in 2005 with Huracan and Belgrano. After receiving an offer to return to Europe, Mandra agreed to join Spanish Segunda División B side UD Melilla as the clubs star signing. Mandra had an up and down stay with Melilla, which included questions regarding his Italian passport. Once these issues were resolved he was unable to regain his first team place, and was sold to Italian side S.S. Barletta Calcio. After a short stay in Italy, Mandra would begin the most successful part of his career. He would sign with Ecuadorian side Deportivo Azogues in 2007 where he scored 11 goals in 21 appearances. This peaked the interest of the top clubs in Ecuador, and for the 2008 season Mandra signed with Deportivo Quito. With Quito Mandra became an adored player as he helped the club to their first league title in 40 years. Mandra was the leagues second leading scorer netting 17 goals in 34 league matches. He also participated in the Copa Sudamericana for Deportivo Quito.

Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia

The destruction of sites associated with early Islam is an on-going phenomenon that has occurred mainly in the Hejaz region of western Saudi Arabia, particularly around the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The demolition has focused on mosques, burial sites, homes and historical locations associated with the Islamic prophet, Muhammad and many of the founding personalities of early Islamic history. In Saudi Arabia, many of the demolitions have officially been part of the continued expansion of the Masjid Al-Haram at Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina and their auxiliary service facilities in order to accommodate the ever-increasing number of people performing the pilgrimage (Hajj) .
Saudi Arabia.
Islam in the Hejaz.
Much of the Arabian Peninsula was politically unified by 1932 in the third and current Saudi State, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The military campaign led by King Abdulaziz ibn Saud and his Bedouin army of inspired tribesmen conquered the Hejaz and ousted the ruling Hashemite clan. The new Najdi rulers, nomadic Arabs largely tribal and illiterate, found themselves at the reins of a highly sophisticated society. A cohesive political structure based on the Majlis al-Shura (consultative council) system had been in place for centuries. A central administrative body managed an annual budget which allocated expenditure on secondary schools, military and police forces.
Similarly, the religious fabric of the Najd and the Hejaz were vastly different. Traditional Hejazi cultural customs and rituals were almost entirely religious in nature. Celebrations honoring the Prophet Muhammad, his family and companions, reverence of deceased saints, visitation of shrines, tombs and holy sites connected with any of these were just some of the customs indigenous to Hejazi Islam.
As administrative authority of the Hejaz passed into the hands of Najdi sunni Muslims from the interior, the sunni Wahabi ‘ulema (body of religious scholars) viewed local religious practices as unfounded superstition superseding codified religious sanction that was considered a total corruption of religion and the spreading of heresy.
What followed was a removal of the physical infrastructure, tombs, mausoleums, mosques and sites associated with the family and companions of the Prophet.
The initial dismantling of the sites began in 1806 when the Wahhabi army of the First Saudi State occupied Medina and systematically levelled many of the structures at the Jannat al-Baqi Cemetery. This is the vast burial site adjacent the Prophet's Mosque (Al-Masjid al-Nabawi) housing the remains of many of the members of Muhammad’s family, close companions and central figures of early Islam. The Ottoman Turks, practitioners themselves of more tolerant and at times mystical strains of Islam, had erected elaborate mausoleums over the graves of Al-Baqi. These were levelled in their entirety. Mosques across the city were also targeted and an attempt was made to tear down Muhammad's tomb.
Widespread vocal criticism of this last action by Muslim communities as far away as India, eventually led to abandoning any attempt on this site.
Political claims made against Turkish control of the region initiated the Ottoman-Saudi war (1811–1818) in which the Saudi defeat forced Wahhabi tribesmen to retreat from the Hejaz back into the interior. Turkish forces reasserted control of the region and subsequently began extensive rebuilding of sacred sites between 1848 and 1860, many of them done employing the finest examples of Ottoman design and craftsmanship.
On April 21, 1925 the mausoleums and domes at Al-Baqi in Medina were once again levelled and so were indicators of the exact location of the resting places of the Muhammad’s family members and descendants, as it remains to the present day. Portions of the famed Qasida al-Burda, the 13th Century ode written in praise of Muhammad by Imam Muhammed al-Busiri (1211–1294), inscribed over Muhammad's tomb were painted over.
Among specific sites targeted at this time were the graves of the Martyrs of the Battle of Uhud, including the grave of the renowned Hamza ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, uncle of Muhammad and one of his most beloved supporters, the Mosque of Fatimah Al Zahraa’, daughter of Mohammad, the Mosque of the Two Lighthouses (Manaratayn) as well as the Qubbat Al-Thanaya, the cupola built as the burial place of Mohammad’s incisor tooth, which was broken from a blow received during the Battle of Uhud.
In Medina, the Mashrubat Umm Ibrahim, the home of Mohammad’s Coptic Egyptian wife Mariah and birthplace of their son Ibrahim, as well as the adjacent burial site of Hamida al-Barbariyya, mother of Imam Musa al-Kadhim, were destroyed during this time. The site was paved over and is today part of the massive marble esplanade beside the Mosque.
Criticism of policy regarding religious heritage sites.
The last ten years have seen an increase in the demolition of sites in Mecca and Medina. As the annual Hajj continues to draw larger crowds year after year, the Saudi authorities have deemed it necessary to raze large tracts of formerly residential neighborhoods around the two mosques to make way for pilgrimage-related infrastructure. In 2010, it was forecast that developers were going to spend an estimated $13 billion on the largest expansion project in the city’s history. 
While there is widespread agreement for the need of facilities that can accommodate greater numbers of pilgrims, the development of upscale hotels and condominium towers, restaurants, shopping centers and even two luxury spas has caused some to criticize the over-commercialization of a site which many consider to be a Divinely ordained sanctuary for Muslims (the very meaning of the Arabic word “Haram” is “sanctuary”). The rapid influx of capitalist investment in Mecca and Medina leads many to believe that money and economic growth are ultimately the bottom line for Saudi authorities. A proposition which critics argue works hand in hand with Wahhabi state policy that looks to impose a massive cultural and social deletion within the Holy Cities,
erasing any elements that give way to practices that go against the Wahhabi creed.
Destroyed sites.
In 1801 and 1802, the Saudi Wahhabis under Abdul Aziz ibn Muhammad ibn Saud attacked and captured the holy Shia cities of Karbala and Najaf in Iraq, massacred parts of the Muslim population and destroyed the tombs of Husayn ibn Ali who is the grandson of Muhammad, and son of Ali (Ali bin Abu Talib), the son-in-law of Muhammad. (see: Saudi sponsorship mentioned previously) In 1803 and 1804 the Saudis captured Mecca and Medina and destroyed historical monuments and various holy Muslim sites and shrines, such as the shrine built over the tomb of Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad, and even intended to destroy the grave of Muhammad himself as idolatrous, causing resentment throughout the Muslim World.

Fuel (hardcore band)

Fuel was a short-lived Bay Area post-hardcore musical act that created both personal and political songs, something that was unique during the "first wave" of emo in the 1990s. Fuel had a sound akin to early-Hot Water Music and especially Fugazi with twin guitars and dueling rough post-hardcore vocals. In fact, it is noted that Fuel was often jokingly referred to as "Fuelgazi." Fuel's style has been compared to the D.C. sound of many Dischord bands.
Fuel featured Mike Kirsch (of early Pinhead Gunpowder and a number of other notable punk rock bands) on guitar/vocals, Jim Allison on guitar/vocals, Aaron Arroyo on bass, and Jeff Stofan (also of Monsula and the White Trash Debutantes at one time) on drums.
In 2008, "Alternative Press" named Fuel as a group of significant interest in its profile of "23 Bands who Shaped Punk." Jason Black of Hot Water Music and The Draft contributed a testimony for the article citing musical influence.
Discography.
Fuel released one LP “Monuments to Excess” in 1990, first on Cargo Records then repressed by Ebullition Records. Monuments to Excess is notable in that it was produced by Kevin Army. Army is an engineer that has worked with many influential punk bands (e.g., Operation Ivy, Green Day, The Mr. T Experience, etc.). In addition, Fuel put out an EP "Take Effect" on Lookout Records, also in 1990.

Track Listing:
A CD release of the entire 18-song "Fuel discography" (the EP, the LP and a few songs from splits and compilations) was released under the same name as the band's LP, Monuments to Excess, by Rough Trade Records, then by (the now defunct) Allied Recordings, and has since been repressed and made currently available by the label, Broken Rekids.

Brooker's merocyanine

Brooker's merocyanine ("1-methyl-4-[(oxocyclohexadienylidene)ethylidene]-1,4-dihydropyridine", 'MOED') is an organic dye belonging to the class of merocyanines.
MOED is notable for its solvatochromic properties, meaning it changes color depending on the solvent it is dissolved in. 
As shown in the structural formula, MOED can exist in two resonance forms: A neutral molecule and a zwitterion. Research indicates that the zwitterion form is most representative when the compound exists in polar solvents such as water, and the neutral form when it exists in nonpolar solvents such as chloroform.
Solvatochromic effects.
When MOED is dissolved in various liquids, its color will vary, depending on the solvent and its polarity. In general, the more polar the solvent, the shorter the wavelengths of the light absorbed will be. When light of a certain color (wavelength) is absorbed, the solution will appear in the complementary color of the one absorbed. Therefore, in water, a highly polar solvent, MOED appears yellow (corresponding to absorbed blue light of wavelengths 435-480 nm), but is purple or blue (corresponding to absorbed green to yellow light of wavelengths 560-595 nm) in acetone, a less polar solvent. The effect stems in part from the stabilization of the ground state of the merocyanine molecule in polar solvents, which increases the energy gap between the ground state and excited states, which corresponds to shorter wavelengths (increased energy) of the absorbed light.
Uses.
Because of its solvatochromic properties MOED, and solvatochromic dyes in general, are useful as solvent polarity indicators, and for creating solutions that absorb light at a specific frequency. Additional potential areas of use include pH sensors and transition metal cation indicators. Research into merocyanine dyes is ongoing.
Synthesis.
Brooker's merocyanine can be prepared beginning with the methylation of 4-methylpyridine to produce 1,4-dimethylpyridium iodide. Reaction with 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and subsequent treatment with aqueous base provides Brooker's merocyanine.

The Star (Wells short story)

"The Star" is an 1897 apocalyptic short story by H.G. Wells.
Plot summary.
In January (about 1900, presumably), the people of Earth awaken to the notion that a strange luminous object has erupted, into the Solar System, after disturbing the normal orbit of the planet Neptune. Indeed, such object is a luminous celestial body, whose luminosity is distinguishable on the sky about the constellation of Leo.
Although initially it is a matter of concern only for astronomers, eventually the world media announces that it is a whole star, heading in a collision course toward the center of our star system. In its way, the star had enwrapped Neptune indeed, bringing it inside. Although many people are concerned by this, the issue amounts to little more than a temporary fad.
The loose star continues its path, now affecting the planet Jupiter and all its moons. At this point, the studies of a mathematician are published throughout the world. He explains that both the intruding star and our Sun are exerting reciprocal gravitational attraction, and as a result it is being pulled deeper into the solar system. With the orientation of the star being what it is, it is determined that the star would either hit Earth or pass by at close proximity, which would lead to apocalyptic ecological consequences. While the Earth is losing its nights owing to its luminosity, many people begin to worry. Some cynics continue to refute this, remembering the year 1000, in which humanity also anticipated the world's end.
The English winter softens progressively into a thaw, as the intruding star grows fast on the sky. Its high speed is evident during the worst hours of the event. On that day, in the sky above England the relative size of the star was equivalent to a third of the size of the Moon. Upon reaching the skies of the United States the relative size had already increased to the size of the Moon. 
Soon all of the ice on Earth's surface begins to melt, causing widespread flooding. The star then begins to overshadow the Sun, whose hours seem darker. The planet crust is affected too, with massive cracks forming and releasing lava on to the surface of the Earth. Tidal waves hit, particularly in the Pacific area, and leads to devastation across the world. Most of the human population perishes, and its works are rendered unusable, cities, farms, etc. The few survivors witness that the Moon interposes before the traveling star creating a weak eclipse, as it is permanently removed from its steady orbit about the Earth, into a new, more distant orbit. The star then resumes its path to finally meet the Sun.
Earth manages to survive despite the massive havoc that has been brought upon its surface. Extensive areas of Greenland have been thawed and are now green and pleasant for inhabitation. Humans settle in new areas close to the poles, where the climate is more temperate. Meanwhile, Martian astronomers have witnessed the events, concluding that the Earth's survival has been a miracle, and praise the resilience of the planet after the majority of its ice layers have melted.
Influence.
An astronomer named Ogilvy appears at the start of the story. An astronomer named Ogilvy also appears at the start of Wells' novel "The War of the Worlds".
The early part of the story, before the dire danger had become obvious, includes a reference to a South African city where ""a great man had married, and the streets were alight to welcome his return with his bride. 'Even the skies have illuminated,' said the flatterer"". This is considered to be a snide reference to Cecil Rhodes, at the height of his power and influence at the time of writing. 
This story can be credited with having created a Science Fiction sub-genre depicting a planet or star colliding, or near-colliding with Earth - such as the 1933 novel "When Worlds Collide" by Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer, (made into a film in 1951), Fritz Leiber's "The Wanderer" (1965), and "Lucifer's Hammer" by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (1977). 
The story is mentioned in Arthur C. Clarke's novel "Rendezvous with Rama", and Clarke also used the title for a story of his own.
The radio anthology series Radio Tales adapted the story as its episode, "Asteroid".

Louisa County High School

Louisa County High School is a secondary school for students of Louisa County, Virginia in the United States. It serves as the school for students in the county in grades 9-12.
History.
Louisa County High School was created by the consolidation of Louisa, Mineral, and Apple Grove high schools, opening for classes in 1940. The high school was integrated in the fall of 1969.
The largest class of LCHS was the Class of 2009, which graduated 358 students.
The 2011 Virginia earthquake caused significant damage to the school. Following an investigation, the building was condemned. As a temporary measure, the high school students shared the middle school for the next several months. High school students attended on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, while middle school students attended Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. As this was going on, a system of modular buildings were set up in the high school parking lot. Starting the first of February, the high school students began attending class in the modular buildings. It has not yet been established when a new high school will be built.
Curriculum.
The high school offers courses in a wide variety of departments, including Alternative Education, Career & Technical Education, English, Fine Arts, Foreign Language, Guidance, Mathematics, Physical Education, Science, Social Studies, and Special Education.
The school also offers several Advanced Placement Program (AP) classes and dual-enrollment courses with both J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College and Piedmont Virginia Community College.
After having a horrifc earthqauke the first week of school in August the louisa lions are pouncing back to normal they had a few bumy rides with sharing the school with the middle schoolers to having a mobile school.
Extracurricular activities.
Student groups and activities at Louisa County High School include anime club, band, Ex Libris, FBLA, FCCLA, FFA,SCA, fishing club, foreign language club, gospel choir, guitar club, HOSA, Impact club, Interact, juggling club, National Art Honor Society, National Honor Society, newspaper, Odyssey of the Mind, Renaissance club, Scholastic Bowl, SkillsUSA, SCUBA Club, Student Organization for Developing Attitudes, Thespians, Tri-M, TSA, Varsity Club, and yearbook.
Athletics.
Louisa County High School is a member of the Virginia High School League and belongs to the Jefferson District in AA Region II. The school's teams, known as the Louisa Lions, compete in baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, field hockey, football, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, indoor/outdoor track, volleyball, swimming, and wrestling.
Louisa is known for having a heavily supported football program, due to success in the years since 2004, reaching the state championship game in 2006. The football field known as "The Jungle" was awarded the 2011 Best School and Parks Football Field in America. 
The Lions have won a few Virginia state titles during their history. The most recent one was by the boys' indoor track team in 2009. The Lions have also had luck in Baseball, having won a state title in 1990, and cross country back in the late 1990s.

The Kinetiks

The Kinetiks were a Meteor Award-nominated Irish rock, pop and indie musical ensemble from Dublin. They were vocalist and guitarist Gaz Harding, guitarist Sean Brennan, bassist Jim McGuire, and drummer Paul Donohoe. On 11 July 2008, they performed their biggest show thus far at Oxegen 2008 where they appeared second on the Green Room stage following Dirty Epics and prior to The Saw Doctors. They have also performed at the inaugural annual surf festival Cois Fharraige on 8 September 2007, Indie-pendence in August 2008 and Hard Working Class Heroes in September 2008.
Formation.
The band formed in 2007. They shared influences such as the Beach Boys, The Strokes, The Who and The Beatles. On first hearing the band's track "A Smile'd Crack Your Face" RTÉ 2fm's producer, Ian Wilson booked the Dubliners for a live session with the station. "A Smile’d Crack Your Face", released on the band's debut EP "High Horse Olympics" in summer 2007 became a favourite of RTÉ 2fm DJs Dan Hegarty and Jenny Huston as well as Ray Foley on Today FM and drew the attention of producer Gareth Mannix, who had previous experience working with Director, Delorentos, Republic of Loose and Humanzi. With Mannix The Kinetiks recorded the singles "Shuffle Your Feet" and "Bite the Bullet", described by "The Irish Times" as "Kin brilliant." Their "Aye Aye Aye Aye" EP is due for release on 6 March, the E.P was recorded in Grouse Lodge Studios, Westmeath, Sun Studios Dublin and Suite Studios Dublin by Marc Carolan (Muse/The Cure) and Gareth Mannix (The Thrills/The Flaws) and an album is forthcoming.
Break Up.
In August 2009 Gaz Harding published a blog on the bands Myspace stating that The Kinetiks were no more. "People wanting different things from their lives" was the only reason given in the blog for the bands break-up.
Notable performances.
The Kinetiks appeared on "The Once a Week Show" on 6 October 2007.
They have also sold out the music venue Whelan's of Wexford Street in Dublin, topped the Phantom airplay chart and have provided support for a range of bands including The Enemy in the Ambassador Theatre, Young Knives and Scouting for Girls. The band have achieved considerable airplay on other radio stations such as RTÉ 2fm and Today FM.
At Oxegen 2008, The Kinetiks followed Dirty Epics onto the Green Room stage. In an interview with the "Irish Independent" beforehand, the band said they relished the prospects of playing in front of their biggest audience to date. Vocalist Gaz Harding (23) said: "We're not nervous, just looking forward to it. Obviously the tent is massive. We're going to go and do what we do and hope that everyone will be blown away and we can go out and have a great night afterwards." 
On 16 January 2009, The Kinetiks featured on Aidan Power's "The Cafe", performing "Lightbulb" the lead track from their "Aye Aye Aye Aye" EP.
In July 2009, they supported the charity music site Music Box For Life.Com by donating some of their music.

No More Dead Dogs

No More Dead Dogs is a novel by Gordon Korman published in 2002. Its title alludes to the fact that many books for children and young adults featuring dogs often have the dog die (such as "Old Yeller" or "Where the Red Fern Grows"), including the fictional novel that begins to cause the main source of all the character's problems, "Old Shep, My Pal". The main plot revolves around a play based on "Old Shep" where the ending has been changed to let the dog live.
Plot summary.
Ever since Wallace Wallace (main character) was young, he has insisted on telling the truth. After scoring the winning touchdown for the Bedford Middle School football team in the championship, Wallace Wallace has become a popular guy. What the entire town and most of the football team don't realize is that Wallace is really a benchwarmer, whose winning touchdown was a fluke. His former best friend, football team captain Steve Cavanaugh, knows that the winning move was lucky and has cut ties with Wallace because of it.
When Wallace is assigned to write a report on the book "Old Shep, My Pal", he won't lie about his feelings. He dislikes the book and writes a negative review, which results in a detention handed down by his English teacher, Mr. Fogelman, until he writes a quality review. His detention is spent with the drama club. The drama club is led by Mr. Fogelman, and they are working on a production of "Old Shep, My Pal" written by Mr. Fogelman. Wallace is initially bored. But as he spends more and more time with the drama club he starts to edit the play, much to the irritation of Mr. Fogelman and Rachel Turner, the president of the drama club. Everyone but Rachel and Mr. Fogelman love the changes Wallace makes to the production, especially Rachel's best friend, Trudi Davis, who is in love with Wallace. When Wallace's detention is complete, he quits the football team to join the drama club. The student body does not take this lightly, as they view him as the hero of the team.
Soon after Wallace joins the club, an unknown person vandalizes the play set and rehearsals. Rachel believes Wallace is the culprit. Everyone else initially regards him as a hero and refuses to believe her, but when one of Wallace's scrimmage jerseys appears during the final sabotage attempt, they turn against him. Rachel changes her mind to believe that Wallace isn't the vandal.
Wallace is eventually banned from the play entirely. Despite his ban, the drama club decides to use Wallace's ideas for the play, including having Shep live at the end. This decision results in disaster when the saboteur blows up the prop Shep with a cherrybomb during the performance—just as the actors praise his miraculous recovery.
Meanwhile, Wallace figures out that the culprit is Rachel's brother Dylan, who wanted revenge because he felt the play had ruined the famous Wallace Wallace. Consequently, Wallace tells his first lie to spare Rachel's feelings. He tells her that it was him vandalizing the play. After her initial anger at Wallace, she realizes on her own that Dylan was behind the attacks. Wallace and Rachel recognize their mutual feelings of love, and plan to go on a date together. As for Trudi, she ends up dating Steve. Furthermore, Steve and Wallace make up and are friends again.
Reception.
Jo Clarke in her review for Book Report said that "this was one of the funniest books I have ever read!" and that "Middle school kids will enjoy this book because it is so typical of their language, actions, and ideas.". The Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy said that "the book is filled with jokes aimed at an adult audience rather than one middle schoolers. These are jokes that desperately wish to be funny but the book produces only one that would be considered genuinely amusing to its demographic." and that ""No More Dead Dogs" had serious potential to be a much better book than the writing produced."

<doc id="20686666" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20686666" title="Fort Beversreede">
Fort Beversreede

Fort Beversreede (after 1633–1651) was a Dutch-built palisaded factorij located near the confluence of the Schuylkill River and the Delaware River. It was an outpost of the colony of New Netherland, which was centered around its capital, New Amsterdam (Manhattan), on the North River (Hudson River).
Location.
The exact location of the fort is uncertain. A 1655 Swedish map shows it on the west bank of the Schuylkill River, on Providence Island (now part of the mainland), just south of Minquas (also known as Eagle's Nest or Mingo) Creek. Scharf & Westcott put it on the east bank of the Schuylkill River, opposite Minquas Creek. A 1770s map of Philadelphia's naval defenses shows a fort on the island, but it is unidentified.
Directly adjacent to (or opposite) the fort was the terminus of the Great Minquas Path, an 80-mile (130 km) trail from the Susquehanna River to the Schuylkill River. This was the primary trade route for furs from the Susquehannock people, and the Dutch named the trail "Beversreede" or "Beaver Road."
Swedes.
Though never recognized by the Dutch, the Delaware Valley region was effectively under control of the Swedish colony of New Sweden, which was first settled in 1638 at Fort Christina (now Wilmington, Delaware). Though the Swedes' colony included Dutch residents, the only official Dutch presence in the area was across the Delaware River at Fort Nassau, at the mouth of Big Timber Creek (south of today's Gloucester City, New Jersey). In 1642, members of the Connecticut Colony attempted to settle in the area, but their homes were burned and the nascent colony was repelled.
The Swedes had a competing claim for land at the mouth of the Schuylkill River, and they often vandalized Fort Beversreede. In 1648, they built a stockaded 30-by-20-foot blockhouse directly in front of it. Their Fort Nya Korsholm was meant to intimidate the Dutch residents and intercept trade. In 1651, the Dutch abandoned Fort Beversreede and dismantled and relocated Fort Nassau to the Christina River, downstream from the Swedes' Fort Christina. The Dutch consolidated their forces at the rebuilt fort, renamed Fort Casimir. It was not until 1655 that control of the area was regained by the Dutch in a military expedition led by Director-General of New Netherland Petrus Stuyvesant, establishing a regional capital at New Amstel.
Site.
There is no remnant of either Fort Beversreede or Fort Nya Korsholm. Nearby Mud Island became the site of Fort Mifflin in 1771. Widening of the Schuylkill's channel, subsequent land reclamation, as well as other transportation and industrial infrastructure have dramatically changed the area. But the site of the forts (whether on the east or west bank of the Schuylkill) is probably south of the mouth of Mingo Creek and north of the George C. Platt Bridge.

Freeworld Entertainment

Freeworld Entertainment was a record label formed in 1997 by Dallas Austin and Kevin Czinger.
History.
Inception (1996-1998).
The history of Freeworld begins with Kevin Czinger's purchase of Zoo Entertainment from BMG in 1996 with the support of financial backers Allen & Co. Though Zoo was initially run in conjunction with Czinger's own label Volcano Entertainment, it was eventually absorbed into it. In the fall of 1997, Czinger merged the label with Dallas Austin's Rowdy Records to create Freeworld Entertainment. As a combination of the two producers' respective labels, Freeworld consisted of artists from both previous labels' catalogs. The label benefited from Austin's industry connections and Czinger's keen insight into the business. Unfortunately, the label was wrought with bad luck from its inception. In September 1997, a month after Austin and Czinger worked together, former Volcano flagship artist Tool attempted to dissolve ties to the label by claiming that Freeworld had failed to exercise its option to renew the band's contract. To make matters worse, Austin removed himself from the label after Freeworld made considerable investments in his artists.
Czinger attempted to recall his previous success by changing the name of the label back to Zoo Entertainment, however, the damage was already too severe. In the spring of 1998 after putting more than $20 million info Freeworld, Allen & Co. sold the label to Clive Calder's Zomba Label Group. Zomba eventually brought back the Volcano Entertainment moniker. It wasn't until December 1998 that the lawsuit with Tool was resolved, however, by then the Freeworld name had been dissipated.
Reactivation (1999-2002).
In early 1999, Capitol entered into a relationship with Austin to restart the Freeworld Entertainment label. Some of the first artists on the newly formed label were Detroit vocal quartet Vega and preteen R&B vocalist Sammie. The new version of Freeworld lasted sometime into the early 2000s, however, it eventually dissolved as well. Austin would go on to reform his own Rowdy Records in 2005 under the Universal Music Group.

Common ISDN Application Programming Interface

The Common ISDN Application Programming Interface (short CAPI) is an ISDN-conform standardized software interface. With the help of the CAPI-Interface computer software intended for the use with ISDN can be provided, without knowledge of the deployed, proprietary ISDN card.
CAPI was designed from 1989 by German manufacturers (AVM, Systec, Stollmann). Since 1991 CAPI is being developed further by "CAPI Association e.V." Implementations exist for different operating systems like Linux and Microsoft Windows.
Through the ETSI CAPI 2.0 was introduced as standard ETS 300 324 (Profile B).
Primarily CAPI was designed for data transfer over ISDN. The specification has been extended multiple times, thereby it became important to the area of voice- and fax-communication. Because pure data transfer over IP-based networks is dominant in modern times, CAPI is being used primarily in the scope of voice applications (voice mail, IVR, call-center, voice conference systems etc.), for fax-servers and combined systems (UMS).
The CAPI Interface in its current release (CAPI 2.0) supports a variety of signaling protocols (D channel protocols), e.g. DSS1 and FTZ 1 TR 6. The interface operates in the OSI model between layer 3 and 4 but only controls layers 1 to 3.
Besides popular signaling protocols for ISDN implementations of CAPI for ATM, GSM and VoIP (H.323 and SIP) exist, thus CAPI applications can be used directly on cutting edge communications infrastructure. Special extensions for protocol-specific features were defined several years ago for ATM. Specification extensions for VoIP (codec negotiation, advanced addressing etc.) will be available shortly.

Charles M. Berger

Charles M. Berger (1936–2008) was a business executive who created several well-known advertising campaigns for Heinz ketchup. He worked for Heinz for 32 years before moving on to become CEO of Scotts Miracle-Gro Company. Berger died in 2008 at the age of 72 after a protracted illness.
Education and early career.
Berger was born in 1936 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania to Edward and Sadie Berger. He attended Princeton University where he graduated in 1958 and Harvard Business School where he earned his M.B.A. in 1960. His father owned a drugstore in Scranton, Pennsylvania where it is said he learned about the power of branding. Berger started his career at Procter & Gamble in 1960 before being offered a position by Heinz in 1964.
Heinz.
Berger was behind the Heinz ketchup marketing campaign that touted the ketchup as being thick and having slow pouring qualities. Advertisements included "the ketchup race" from 1964 and "the slowest ketchup in the West." The commercials showed Heinz being poured from bottles, racing its competitors to see which was thicker. They became one of Heinz's most popular marketing campaigns and were played during Super Bowl V in 1971. The campaigns also spun into the 1970s Heinz "Anticipation" commercials that used a hit song by Carly Simon.
Heinz Chairman and CEO William R. Johnson credited Berger for Heinz success with ketchup by stating that Berger's marketing ideas allowed "Heinz to break out of a tie and gain permanent leadership in ketchup." Berger worked for Heinz for 32 years and was in charge of Heinz's operations in India before leaving to become CEO at The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company in 1996.
While at Heinz, Berger held numerous positions. In 1970, he became the head of marketing for Heinz's British division. From 1972 to 1979, Charles ran Plasmon, Heinz’s Italian division. In 1980, Berger became president of Heinz's Weight Watchers division, where he doubled revenue by expanding its supermarket offerings and turned it into Heinz's fastest growing division.
Scotts Miracle-Gro Company.
In 1996, Berger became CEO of Scotts Miracle-Gro Company. He had been on the board of Miracle-Gro since the 1980s. As CEO, Berger changed the focus of Scotts to being a more consumer oriented company by increasing advertising spending, evolving the brand from that of a chemical company. Sales doubled during his time with the company, largely due to the acquisition of Monsanto Companys' garden unit which included the Ortho pesticide brand. Scotts later built the Berger Learning Center, a multimedia classroom at the company's headquarters.
Berger was Chairman and CEO of Scotts until he retired in 2001. James Hagedorn succeeded Berger as CEO of Scotts and credited Berger as "largely responsible for the company as it exists today." Berger stayed on as Chairman until he retired from company altogether in January 2003.
Board of directors.
Berger was a member of various non-profit boards including being Chairman of the American School of Milan and a Board Member for the European Area Young Presidents Association.
Personal life.
Berger was married to Jane Purdy Berger for 48 years preceding his death in 2008. He is survived by three children, Cary, Elizabeth and Valerie, and seven grandchildren.

Highly Recommended

Highly Recommended was a six-part Irish lifestyle game show broadcast each Sunday on RTÉ One at 20:30. Presented by Joe Duffy, the premise was that members of the general public would compete each week to convince a panel of consumer experts that their deal ought to be "Highly Recommended" (hence the title of the show). The panel, consisting of Ben Dunne, Conor Pope and Barbara McCarthy, scrutinised the deals placed before them whilst Duffy embarked on a trek into the studio audience to ask its opinions. A debate ensued and, if the deal stayed strong and the panel remained convinced, the consumer in question won a total of €2000. Topics incurred ranged from health insurance, medical and dental holidays, electrical goods, online shopping and weddings. The public could also give their opinion by voting on an online poll to determine whether they "Highly Recommended" the featured deals. The results were then featured at the beginning of the next show. The show aired in November 2007.

Munenaga

, an imperial prince (the eighth son of Emperor Godaigo) and a poet of the Nijō poetic school of Nanboku-chō period, mostly known for his compilation of the "Shin'yō Wakashū". 
Prince Munenaga led a turbulent life, which quite likely served as an impetus for his poetic sensibility. In 1326 he took tonsure as a Tendai priest on Mount Hiei and swiftly advanced in his studies of the Buddhist doctrine.
In 1330 Prince Munenaga became the head priest of Tendai school, but was soon after banished to Sanuki in Shikoku for his participation in the Genkō War, where he had fought for his father's cause of imperial restoration. After three years of exile he marched his troops into Kyoto. Subsequently, when the imperial army lost to Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, Prince Munenaga took refuge on Mount Hiei with his father, Emperor Godaigo.
In 1338, when one of his relatives suggested that Prince Munenaga abandon resistance and return to Kyoto, the prince replied with this poem:
Thus in an elegant poetic form Prince Munenaga replied that he would not abandon his father and stayed in the mountains of Yoshino to continue the fight despite all the hardships.
For the rest of his life, Prince Munenaga was at the head of resistance against the Muromachi bakufu and the Northern Court. The date of his death is uncertain, but some historians believe it to be around 1385 CE.

A Glimpse of Hell (book)

"A Glimpse of Hell: The Explosion on the USS "Iowa" and Its Cover-Up" is a nonfiction book of investigative journalism, written by Charles C. Thompson II and published in 1999. The book describes the USS "Iowa" turret explosion that took place on April 19, 1989 and the subsequent investigations that tried to determine the cause. The explosion aboard the United States Navy battleship killed 47 of the turret's crewmen.
Soon after the explosion, Thompson was informed by an "Iowa" crewman that the Navy was conducting a dishonest investigation into the cause of the tragedy. Thompson, a producer for the television newsmagazine "60 Minutes", later produced several television reports which disputed the Navy's conclusions as to what had caused the explosion.
Based on his work for the "60 Minutes" reports plus further investigation on his own, Thompson wrote "A Glimpse of Hell". The book was published by W. W. Norton & Company. Thompson's book was extremely critical of most of the Navy personnel involved in the investigation, concluding that the Navy had orchestrated a cover-up to conceal the true cause of the explosion.
Upon its publication, the book received favorable comments from book reviewers. Thompson later claimed that the Navy tried to suppress sales by banning the book from Navy exchange stores on Navy bases throughout the world. In 2001, five Navy servicemen named in Thompson's book sued Thompson, the book's publisher, and one of Thompson's sources for libel, false light privacy, and conspiracy. The suit was settled out-of-court in 2007 for undisclosed terms.
Background.
On the morning of April 19, 1989, the United States Navy battleship , under the command of Captain Fred Moosally, was northeast of Puerto Rico, steaming at , and preparing to engage in a live-fire exercise with its 16-inch guns. At 09:53, as the ship's 16-inch Turret Two loaded and prepared to fire its three guns, a fireball between 2500 and 3000 °F (1400 and 1650 °C) and traveling at with a pressure of blew out from the turret's center gun's open breech. The fireball spread through all three of the turret's gun rooms and through much of the lower levels of the turret. All 47 crewmen inside the turret were killed.
Soon after the fires in the turret were extinguished, Vice Admiral Joseph S. Donnell, commander of Surface Forces Atlantic, appointed Rear Admiral Richard Milligan to conduct an informal one-officer investigation into the explosion. Milligan boarded "Iowa" with his staff on April 20 and began his investigation by interviewing "Iowa" crewmembers. Milligan's investigation continued after "Iowa" returned to its home port of Norfolk on April 23.
Five days after the explosion, a gunner's mate who worked in "Iowa's" Turret One called Charles Thompson and told him that Milligan was conducting a dishonest investigation. "The news media is the only thing that can keep the Navy honest" said the caller. Thompson, a producer for "60 Minutes", was a former US Navy officer and naval gunfire spotter who had served two tours of duty during the Vietnam War. After leaving the military and becoming a journalist, Thompson had produced numerous news stories about military subjects. Thompson discussed the phone call with his colleague and journalist Mike Wallace, also a former naval officer, who asked him to begin following news stories about the explosion and the Navy's investigation into its cause more closely.
Robert Zelnick, an ABC News reporter, wrote an editorial for the "New York Times" on September 11, 1989 titled, "The Navy Scapegoats a Dead Seaman." In the editorial, Zelnick was sharply critical of the Navy's conclusions, stating that Hartwig had been subjected to a "process of guilt by fiat" and that the evidence against the sailor was very weak. Mike Wallace read Zelnick's article and asked Thompson to produce a report for broadcast on the explosion and the Navy's investigation.
With help from a team of ex-military officers, including Ed Snyder, a former commander of the battleship USS "New Jersey", Thompson produced a story which aired on "60 Minutes" in November 1989. The story, conducted by Mike Wallace, heavily criticized the findings of Milligan's investigation. The story contained an interview in which Milligan defended his conclusions, saying, "Mike, there is no other cause of this accident. We have looked at everything. We've ruled out everything. This was a deliberate act, most likely done by Petty Officer Hartwig."
The Navy's conclusions were heavily criticised by the victim's families, the media, and congress. After a test found that an overram of the powder bags into the gun could have caused the explosion, the Navy reopened the investigation. On October 17, 1991 Frank Kelso, the new Navy Chief of Naval Operations, announced that the Navy could not determine who or what had caused the tragedy. Kelso apologized to Hartwig's family and closed the Navy's investigation. An independent review of the Navy's investigation by Sandia National Laboratories concluded that the explosion had probably been caused by an overram of the powder bags into the center gun's breech, possibly because of a malfunction in the rammer mechanism or because the gun crew was inadequately trained. Soon after, "60 Minutes" broadcast an updated story on the Navy's investigation. The report, written and produced by Thompson and Wallace, included an interview with Kelso.
After the Navy closed its investigation, Thompson continued his own research into the explosion and its aftermath. Thompson was assisted by Snyder and other former Navy personnel, including "Iowa" crewmen and Navy headquarters staff members. Family members of the victims as well as staff members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees also helped Thompson. In addition, he obtained information via Freedom of Information Act requests to the Navy. Furthermore, Thompson accessed depositions taken from Navy leaders and investigators during a lawsuit against the Navy by Hartwig's family.
Thompson's book was published on April 19, 1999, the tenth anniversary of the explosion. The book's publisher was W. W. Norton & Company, based in New York City.
Content.
The book begins by describing conditions aboard "Iowa" before the explosion. Thompson depicts Moosally, the ship's captain, as an inept seaman who gained command of the battleship through political connections. Under Moosally's leadership, or lack thereof, "Iowa" operated with severe training and safety deficiencies, especially with regard to operations with the ship's 16-inch guns. The book details how the ship's Master Chief Fire Controlman, Stephen Skelley, conducted illegal gunnery experiments with the 16-inch guns. Moosally apparently did not check to ensure that the experiments were authorized, or in some cases, appears not to have been aware that they were being carried out.
The book describes the explosion on April 19, 1989 and the heroic efforts by the ship's crew to contain the fires and avoid a cataclysmic detonation of the turret's powder magazines. After the fires were contained, Moosally ordered the crew to immediately begin cleaning-up the turret. The clean-up involved removing the bodies of the deceased turret crewman and disposing of the damaged turret equipment, all without photographing or otherwise recording the locations of the bodies or equipment which would have presumably assisted with the resulting investigation.
NIS investigators tried to prove, unsuccessfully, that Hartwig and Truitt had had a homosexual relationship with each other and that Hartwig had initiated the explosion after the relationship had soured. As the NIS investigation continued, information about the Navy's focus on the two sailors and innuendoes about their relationship were leaked to the media. The leaks were later attributed to have come from the NIS and from the Navy's headquarters. Thompson alleges that during its investigation, NIS agents lied or otherwise conducted themselves in an extremely unprofessional manner.
Captain Joseph Miceli, assigned by the Navy to lead the technical investigation into the explosion, had supervised the preparation of powder and shells used in "Iowa's" 16-inch guns. Thus, according to Thompson, Miceli had a conflict of interest in ensuring that the powder, ammunition, or guns were not at fault in the explosion. After being briefed on the NIS's focus on Hartwig, Miceli directed his investigative team to determine how Hartwig had initiated the explosion using an electrical or chemical detonator.
Throughout the investigation, according to Thompson, Admiral Leon A. Edney, the Navy's Vice Chief of Naval Operations, interfered with the investigation by sending suggestions to Milligan on avenues of inquiry and pushing for a finding that Hartwig or Truitt was responsible. Edney interfered with the investigation in order to prevent any findings that the Navy had knowingly operated an unsafe ship in an unsafe manner. Also, Edney feared that if the "Iowa" class battleships were found to be unsafe, the battleships would be decommissioned and the Navy would lose the associated admiral billets plus the other warships and support ships assigned to the battleship groups.
In September 1989, the Navy announced that it had determined that Hartwig intentionally caused the explosion. The victim's family members, many in the media, and the United States Congress rejected the Navy's findings. Sandia National Laboratories, acting on a request from the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, determined that the explosion could have been an accident caused by overraming the powder bags into the gun's breech during the loading process. Forced by the revelation to reopen its investigation, the Navy inexplicably, according to Thompson, placed Miceli in charge of the new inquiry.
Nineteen months later, the Navy concluded that it could not determine who or what had caused the explosion, provided a partial apology to Hartwig's family, and closed its investigation. In contrast, Sandia concluded that the explosion had probably been caused by an overram of the powder bags into the center gun's breech, possibly because of a malfunction in the rammer mechanism or because the gun crew was inadequately trained.
Critical reception, Navy reaction, and movie.
Upon its publication, the book received favorable reviews. Dan Blue, reviewing the book for the "San Francisco Chronicle", stated that, "In its main outlines, it convinces" and "Beyond accuracy, Thompson's book provides a gripping read". Steve Weinberg, in the "Denver Post", wrote that, "Measured by its information gathering, this is a great book of investigative journalism." The book was selected by the Book of the Month Club as its featured selection in March 1999.
Thompson stated that after the book was published a previously scheduled invitation to speak at the US Navy's National Museum was rescinded, his book was banned from being sold in the museum's book store, and Navy exchange stores at bases throughout the world were forbidden from selling his book. Emails between Navy officials obtained by Thompson through a Freedom of Information Act request included one from a Navy public affairs officer dated April 15, 1999 saying with regard to Thompson, "I will call book wholesalers and tell them not to set up book signings with this author."
The Navy denied that it attempted to suppress or censor Thompson's book, stating that it had simply refused permission for Thompson to hold book signings on any Navy bases. In August 1999 "Salon.com" checked the bookstores at the United States Naval Academy, Naval Submarine Base New London, and "Iowa's" former home base Naval Station Norfolk and did not find the book available for sale at any of the locations.
In 2001 the FX TV network broadcast a movie "A Glimpse of Hell" based on Thompson's book, starring James Caan and Robert Sean Leonard. The movie received a 3.3 household rating and drew 2.7 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, enough to make the movie the most-watched program in FX's seven-year history.
W. W. Norton does not appear to have released sales figures for the book. As of January 2009, "Amazon.com" lists the book at #997,726 in sales out of all books offered by the bookseller, and at No. 85 in books related to the state of Iowa.
Lawsuit.
In March 2001 Moosally, Miceli, and two other former "Iowa" officers filed suit against Thompson, W. W. Norton, and Dan Meyer, who the plaintiffs stated provided much of the information used in the book, for libel, false light privacy, and conspiracy. In April 2001, another former "Iowa" crewman filed a separate suit with the same attorney for the same causes of action. In response to the suits, Thompson stated that he stood "foursquare" behind his book's content.
In April 2004, the South Carolina Supreme Court dismissed the suits against Thompson and Meyer, but allowed the suit against W. W. Norton to proceed. The court stated that South Carolina's long arm jurisdiction did not apply to Thompson and Meyer, but did to W. W. Norton.
In February 2007 the suits were settled out-of-court for undisclosed terms. Stephen F. DeAntonio, attorney for the plaintiffs, said that his clients felt "totally vindicated." W. W. Norton did not publicly retract or repudiate any of the material in Thompson's book, however, instead sending a letter to the plaintiffs stating, in part, "To the extent you believe the book implies that any of you were engaged in a cover-up, were incompetent, committed criminal acts, violated Naval regulations or exhibited faulty seamanship or professional ineptitude, Norton regrets the emotional distress experienced by you or your family."

Black conservatism in the United States

Black conservatism in the United States is a political and social movement rooted in communities of African descent that aligns largely with the American conservative movement. Since the Civil Rights Movement in the later 20th Century, the African-American community has generally fallen to the left of the right-wing conservative movement, and has predominantly favored itself on the side of liberalism and civil rights progressives. Black conservatism emphasizes traditionalism, strong patriotism, capitalism, free markets, and strong social conservatism within the context of the black church.
Overview.
One of the main characteristics of black conservatism is its emphasis on personal choice and responsibilities above socioeconomic status and institutional racism. In the tradition of African American politics and intellectual life, black conservatives tend to side with Booker T. Washington as contrasted with W. E. B. Du Bois. For many black conservatives, the key mission is to bring repair and success to the Black community by applying the following fundamental principles:
Black conservatives may find common ground with Black Nationalists through their common belief in black empowerment and the theory that black people have been duped by the Welfare state.
On the other hand, some of the policies advocated by Black conservatives are in conflict with some of the key points in the common social, economic, and political positions that a high percentage of African-Americans favor. For example, black conservatives typically oppose affirmative action, which is supported by the vast majority of African American communities. They tend to argue that efforts to obtain reparations for slavery are either misguided or counter-productive. Moreover, black conservatives - especially black Republicans - are often accused of being Uncle Toms. "Ebony" in their May 2001 "100+ Most Influential Black Americans" issue, did not include a number of influential African Americans such as Thomas Sowell, Shelby Steele, Armstrong Williams, Walter Williams and, most notably, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. "The Economist", a British libertarian-leaning magazine, described the exclusion of Thomas from the list as spiteful. Black conservatives favor integration of African Americans into mainstream America and, consequently, disagree with Black nationalism. Black conservatives are more inclined to support economic policies promoting globalization, free trade and tax cuts.
The term "Black Republican" was coined by Democrats in 1854 to describe the newly formed Republican Party. Though the majority of Republicans at the time were white, the Republican Party was founded by abolitionists and generally supported racial equality. Southern Democrats used the term as one of derision, believing that a Lincoln victory in 1860 would lead to widespread slave revolts. The use of the term continued after the Civil War to reflect most Southerners' opinions of the Radical Republicans during Reconstruction. Over the next century, the term "Black Republican" would come to refer specifically to blacks affiliated with or voting for the Republican Party and is now a subset of the broader movement of black conservatism.
According to a 2004 study, 13.7% of blacks identified as "Conservative" or "Extremely Conservative" with another 14.4% identifying as slightly conservative. However the same study indicated less than ten percent identified as Republican or Republican leaning in any fashion. Likewise, a recent Pew Research Center survey showed that 19% of blacks identify as Religious Right. In 2004 the Pew Research Center indicated only 7% of blacks identify as Republican. Hence a certain percentage of noted Black conservatives are likely connected to the Democrats for Life of America movement or economic liberalism.
From Reconstruction up until the New Deal, the black population tended to vote Republican as the Republican Party, particularly in the Southern United States, was seen as more racially liberal than the Democratic Party, primarily because of the role of the southern wing of the Democratic Party as the party of segregation and the Republican Party's roots in the abolitionist movement (see Dixiecrats for more on this). Blacks started to shift in significant numbers to the Democrats with the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose New Deal particularly benefited economically disadvantaged minority communities and helped forge the New Deal coalition which dominated American politics for the next 30 years, and continued with the election of John F. Kennedy. This shift was also influenced by Herbert Hoover's practice of firing loyal African-Americans from positions within the Republican Party, in order to increase his appeal to racist Southern white voters. This can be considered an early example of a set of Republican Party methods that were later termed the Southern Strategy.
Another case study of differences between Black conservatives and Black Republicans is an emphasis on personal empowerment versus theological perspectives. Black Republicans like Colin Powell hold to the social ideas articulated by the early Radical Republicans like Frederick Douglass while at the same time supporting the self-empowerment message of Booker T. Washington. Many social conservatives who are black and Republican hold to a biblically based empowerment although they also appreciate Booker's emphasis on personal accomplishment. Conservatives like the Texas minister T. D. Jakes are evangelical African Americans who support policies more in common but not totally in line with many white Evangelicals.
The African-American church has traditionally been an important element of social and political movements in the Black community. These generally have been identified with persons of the Left or liberalism, like Jesse Jackson, but this is not always true. On issues concerning homosexuality, Black Protestants are more socially conservative than other groups, excepting White Evangelicals. Their view on the issue of homosexual teachers changed less than any other segment based on religion or race.

Dingo Flour sign

The Dingo Flour Sign is a well-known landmark of a stylised silhouetted dingo in red on the side of an historic and heritage-listed working flour mill in North Fremantle, Perth, Western Australia.
The mill is in a complex known as the Great Southern Roller Flour Mills Limited. On the site (which dates from 1922) are silos, an office and laboratory and other buildings. 
The Heritage Council of Western Australia says: “…the place has a landmark quality with strong vertical proportions, height and massing of the mill and silo structures, the Dingo Flour brand image, and the Norfolk Island Pine; the place has been commonly referred to as ‘Dingo Flour Mill’ for many years, showing the impact of the symbol, and has developed its own set of myths, including that it was painted by Alan Bond, demonstrating that the ‘dingo’ contributes to the community’s sense of place…” The mill was designed by architect J.F. Allen, of Allen and Nicholas, and the office building was designed by Powell, Cameron & Chisholm Architects. The sign and the rest of the site was heritage-listed in 2008.
The dingo logo was painted by artist Les Nash in 1940 for £40. It is about four storeys high. It was painted over during World War II, but its outlines were still faintly visible. Refugees and migrants coming to Fremantle saw the sign, and it remains a useful reference point for boaters and anglers. It was most recently re-painted in March 2001. In 2010 the flourmill was renovated, and the dingo now gets re-painted every month.

Liberty Cap Large Cent

The Liberty Cap Large Cent was a type of large cent struck by the United States Mint from 1793 until 1796, when it was replaced by the Draped Bust large cent.
History.
The Liberty Cap large cent, designed by Joseph Wright, was issued by the Mint from 1793 to 1796. The Mint created this type of cent in an attempt to satisfy the public objections to the Chain cent and Wreath cent. It appears to have been a little more successful than its precedents, as it was continued into 1797, unlike the previous two issues, which were issued for one year only. In 1795, the planchets became too thin for the use of edge lettering on the coins, so coins from late-1795 onward have no edge lettering.
The Liberty Cap half cent was designed not by Wright, however, but by Chief Engraver of the Mint, Robert Scot.

Willy Schmidt-Gentner

Willy Schmidt-Gentner (6 April 1894 – 12 February 1964) was one of the most successful German composers of film music in the history of German-language cinema. He moved to Vienna in 1933. At his most productive, he scored up to 10 films a year, including numerous classics and masterpieces of the German and Austrian cinema.
Life.
Schmidt-Gentner was born in Neustadt am Rennsteig in Thuringia, Germany. During his childhood he learnt the violin and took lessons in composition from Max Reger. After World War I Schmidt-Gentner worked as a civil servant checking that cinema owners were paying their full taxes. Through one of his clients he got a position as a band leader at film theatre performances. This raised his interest in films and as early as 1922 he produced his first composition to accompany a silent film. He performed many of his new pieces himself on the piano during films. He was also already responsible at this period for the sound tracks of a number of German classic films, for example "Alraune" (1928), "Die weisse Hölle vom Piz Palü" (1929) and "Hokuspokus" (1930)
With the arrival of sound films he quickly became one of the most sought-after filmscore composers in Germany, so that for a time he was scoring up to 10 films a year. He had a preference for light comedies and cheerful musical romances, but occasionally he took on more heavyweight productions with political overtones, for example the National Socialist propaganda film "Wien 1910" (1943) or the historical film "Spionage" (1955) about the k. u. k. spy Colonel Redl.
In 1933 he moved to Vienna, where he directed his only two films, "Die Pompadour" (1935) and "Prater" (1936), for the company Mondial-Film. For Sascha-Film he composed the music for some of the greatest specimens of the " Wiener Film" genre, among others "Maskerade" and "Hohe Schule" (both 1934). After the Anschluss (the annexation of Austria to Germany) he became the "house composer" for the National Socialist-owned Wien-Film, which had developed out of the former Sascha-Film. For them he scored not only their many escapist romantic comedies, but also some of their few overt propaganda films such as "Heimkehr" (1941), "Wien 1910" (1942) or "Das Herz muß schweigen" (1944). He was also repeatedly commissioned by the top directors of wartime Vienna, Willi Forst and Gustav Ucicky, whom he already knew from previous work, to write scores for their productions, such as "Der Postmeister" (1940), "Operette" (1940), "Wiener Blut" (1942) and "Wiener Mädeln" (1943/1949).
After the end of the war Schmidt-Gentner remained loyal to Vienna and successfully continued his composing career for many more films, predominantly musicals set in Austria, until he retired in 1955. Altogether he composed the music for about 200 films. He died in Vienna on 12 February 1964.

Caspar David Friedrich in his Studio

Caspar David Friedrich in his Studio refers to two paintings by the German romantic artist Georg Friedrich Kersting of 1811 and 1819. Of these the 1819 version is the best known. In these two paintings Kersting depicted fellow German painter Caspar David Friedrich in his studio.
Description.
The picture shows the painter leaning on the back of a chair, focused entirely upon the on the easel before him.
It is not possible for the viewer to see what the artist sees, because only the back of the canvas is visible. Friedrich, apparently lost in thought, holds in his right hand a brush, and in his left a mahlstick, palette, and several other brushes.
The studio is ascetically bare. Only two other palettes, a straightedge, and a t-square hang upon the wall. 
Commentary.
Hamburg version
There are two versions of this portrait. In the Hamburg version (1811) Friedrich is seated before his easel, painting, with his arm leaning on the mahlstick. In this version the viewer shares his view of the painting, which is recognizably a mountain landscape with a waterfall.
There is also a replica of this painting, painted in 1819, which is currently located in Mannheim. 
Berlin version
Caspar David Friedrich sought seclusion, so that he could pursue his work undisturbed. Kersting depicts painting as a contemplative and reflective process - therefore the studio serves as a place of pure concentration. It is not what Frederick paints that is important, but the reverent meditation with which he paints.
In the Berlin version the painter is far more removed from the outside world - a chair leg is interposed between his feet and the viewer, and the door to the left of the composition is no longer visible. Most important, however, is the rotation of the easel, which hides the painting from the viewer. The picture has probably progressed to the point where Friedrich laid aside his plein-air drawings of nature and let his own recollection guide the painting to completion.
All distractions have been removed from the almost empty studio. The painter Karl von Kügelgen added:
The doctor and naturalist Carl Gustav Carus described his working process as follows:
Friedrich himself did not elaborate upon his methods. He spoke and wrote of his studio time as the " consecrated hour " within which he did not wish to be disturbed.
Kügelgen asked himself about the significance of the T-square, which hung as the " sole adornment " on the wall, and how " alone among all other things it was so honored". The reason was that ruler and triangle adhere to the sober simplicity of the studio and to Friedrich's working methods, a number of which involved mathematics.
Studio.
Friedrich's Dresden studio was in the suburb of Pirna. He continued to use it up to 1820. From two sepia drawings from 1805-06 it is evident that the windows here of the studio on the Elbe opened outwards. Friedrich constructed the wooden shutters only after 1806 and took them with him when he moved to a larger house after marrying. These shutters can be seen in the new studio space in the painting "Woman at the Window" of 1822.
Georg Friedrich Kersting.
Georg Friedrich Kersting belonged to the Dresden circle of Friedrich's friends, and like him came from Mecklenburg and had studied from the same teachers in the Copenhagen academy from 1805 to 1808, until settling in Dresden. Kersting accompanied Friedrich in the summer of 1810 on a hike in the Sudeten mountains, and is probably the figure depicted in several of Friedrich's drawings and watercolors from that time. In 1818 Kersting became the head of the painting department of the porcelain factory in Meissen, but still remained in contact with Friedrich for a time.
Kersting preferred painting portraits with an interior setting, and portrayed people familiar to him in a manner that held personal meanings. However, none of his other paintings were as spare as this portrait of his famous friend Friedrich. It differs enormously from the "chaotic study" of the painter Gerhard von Kügelgen, which was stuffed with innumerable plaster casts and painting equipment.

Classic Head

The Classic Head was a design issued by the mint in the early 19th century. It was introduced for copper coinage in 1808 by engraver John Reich and later redesigned and improved by Chief Engraver William Kneass.
Description.
The short-lived Classic Head interpretation of Liberty was designed by John Reich for use on the Half cent and the Large cent, however the design used on the silver and gold coins was developed by William Kneass. The Classic Head depicted Liberty with long, curly hair. The reverse designed by John Reich depicted the coin's denomination and value inside a wreath. 
Kneass's design, however, scaled down the design so it would fit on smaller coins and then added a heraldic eagle on the reverse, substituting the simple design by John Reich. A similar design on gold coinage kept the name "Classic Head", but only retained the curly hair. The head was completely redesigned by William Kneass, and featured a traditional maiden with a ribbon binding her long, curly hair. 
This variety omitted "E pluribus unum" from the reverse of the coin. In 1840, a smaller head was designed to conform with the appearance of the larger gold coins, therefore making the Classic Head design obsolete. The new Classic Head design was produced from 1834 to 1839.
The Classic Head variety was usually preceded by the Draped Bust design and followed by the Matron Head liberty on copper coinage.

Agios Alexandros

Agios Alexandros () is a settlement in the northeastern part of the Aegean island of Lemnos, Greece. It is part of the municipal unit of Moudros and the community of Kontopouli. The population was 13 at the 2001 census. It is located north of the Alyki Lagoon, 4 km southwest of Panagia and 5 km northeast of Kontopouli.
Archaeological sites.
Agios Alexandros was the most important of a series of villages that existed before in the extended region of Kontopouli, most of which are currently uninhabited. The former Monastery of Chloe was mentioned in a patriarchal document of 1320. The name survived in the nearby promontory of Chloi, west of Agios Alexandros, opposite the ancient city Hephaistia. Here was the ancient sanctuary of the Kaveiron, which was excavated during the 1960s. Possibly, the Christian monastery of Chloe was founded at the site of the ancient sanctuary, which was common in Byzantine times.
In a nearby sea cave prehistoric remains have been found. The cave is commonly called the Cave of Philoctetes although the location is not compatible with the ancient literary sources.
History.
The village probably took its name from Saint Alexander, the patron saint of Lemnos according to manuscripts of the 15th century. The name of the saint survived as the name of the settlement, even though there is no church of Saint Alexander in the village. The main church of the settlement is dedicated to Saint Pachomius.
By the mid-19th century, the area north of Kontopouli was uninhabited. In 1858, the German traveller Conze In 1858 the German traveler Conze found cultivation in major parts of the plain between Cape Plaka and Kontopouli but no settlement. There were only isolated huts, which locals called estates. When the estates passed into Christian ownership, settlements started to develop around them. One of them was Agios Alexandros, first marked on the 1904 map of Fredrich. 
It had 34 inhabitants in 1951, 87 in 1961. Between 1959 and 1973 a small public school was operated in the settlement. The school also served pupils from nearby agricultural settlement: Dimosia, Agios Georgios Amniou, Neftina, Saravari and Geranos. It had 32 pupils in 1961. The rise of cotton production in the area brought prosperity to the area, but the decline of cotton production in the 1970s led to mass emigration. It had only one inhabitant in 1981. Presently most inhabitants only spend the summer months in the village.

Twelve Panel

The Twelve Panel egg is a jewelled enameled Easter egg made under the supervision of the Russian jeweller Peter Carl Fabergé in 1899. The egg was made for Alexander Kelch, who presented it to his wife, Barbara (Varvara) Kelch-Bazanova.
Craftmanship.
The egg was created by Peter Carl Faberge's workmaster, Mikhail Evlampievich Perkhin (Russian, 1860-1903) and is crafted of yellow gold, rose-cut diamonds, portrait diamonds, translucent pink en green enamel and opaque white enamel. The upper and lower sections of the Egg are each divided into six panels by bands of matt-finished gold, overlaid with rows of pink enamel roses with gold stems and translucent green leaves. A band of rose-cut diamonds set at intervals with rosettes of additional diamonds encircles the Egg at its widest part. Each end of the Egg is finished with concentric circles of diamonds, gold and green enameled leaf motifs and pink enamel. the top end is centered with a medallion bearing the initials B.T.K. in script under a portrait diamond.; the other end has a similar, though smaller medallion showing the date "1899". The surprise has been lost.
Ownership.
This is the only Kelch Egg that was not part of the lot bought by the Paris jeweler Morgan. The Egg was purchased sometime in the 1920s and bought by A La Vieille Russie in Paris, likely from Barbara Kelch. In 1933 sold by A La Vieille Russie, Paris. Presented at Christmas 1933 by King George V of the United Kingdom as a gift for his wife Queen Mary of Teck, and remains a part of the Royal Collection of Queen Elizabeth II.

<doc id="20687570" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20687570" title="United States presidential election in Delaware, 2008">
United States presidential election in Delaware, 2008

The 2008 United States presidential election in Delaware took place on November 4, 2008 throughout all 50 states and D.C., which was part of the 2008 United States presidential election. Voters chose 3 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.
Delaware was won by Democrat nominee Barack Obama with 25.0% margin of victory. Prior to the election, all 17 news organizations considered this a state Obama would win, or otherwise considered as a safe blue state. His running mate, Joe Biden, a longtime U.S. Senator from Delaware, also helped assure a definite victory. Only one county went for John McCain, the more rural area of Sussex County by a margin of approximately 7,000 votes or 8.58%.
Democratic primary.
The Democratic Primary was held on Super Tuesday, February 5, 2008, and had a total of 15 delegates at stake. The winner in each of Delaware's subdivisions was awarded those subdivisions' delegates, totaling 10. Another five delegates were awarded to the statewide winner, Barack Obama. The 15 delegates represented Delaware at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. Eight other unpledged delegates, known as superdelegates, also attended the convention and cast their votes as well.
Analysis.
Barack Obama’s win in the Delaware Democratic Primary can be traced to a number of factors. According to the exit polls, 64 percent of voters in the Delaware Democratic Primary were Caucasian and they favored Clinton by a margin of 56-40 compared to the 28 percent of African American voters who backed Obama by a margin of 86-9. Obama won all age groups except senior citizens ages 65 and over who strongly backed Clinton by a margin of 56-38. Obama also won middle class and more affluent voters making over $30,000 while Clinton won lower middle class and less affluent voters making less than $30,000. Obama also won higher-educated voters (college graduates 60-35; postgraduate studies 66-32) while high school graduates backed Clinton 51-44; both candidates evenly split voters who had some college and/or an associate’s degree 47-47. Registered Democrats favored Obama 54-42 while Independents also backed him by a margin of 50-44; he also won all ideological groups. Regarding religion, Obama won all major denominations except Roman Catholics who backed Clinton with a 60-35 margin – Obama won Protestants 51-47, other Christians 71-24, and atheists/agnostics 60-35. 
Obama performed best in New Castle County, the most populous and urban part of the state which contains Wilmington as well as several African Americans, which he won by a 56.49-39.69 margin of victory. He also narrowly won neighboring Kent County to the south, which contains the state capital of Dover, with 51.76 percent of the vote. Clinton won Sussex County in Southern Delaware, the more rural and conservative part of the state, with 52.73 percent of the vote.
Republican primary.
The Republican primary was held on February 5 (Super Tuesday). A total of 18 delegates were selected. The Delaware Republican Party rallied behind John McCain, and was the declared winner of the primary election after successfully taking all three Delaware counties. McCain was followed by Mitt Romney in second and then by Mike Huckabee in third.
Candidates.
Candidates Rudy Giuliani, Duncan Hunter, Fred Thompson, and Tom Tancredo had dropped out of the presidential race before the Delaware primary.
Results.
"*Candidate withdrew before primary"
Analysis.
McCain was the expected favorite in the 2008 primary among the Republican candidates; his campaign was led by Delaware's only House representative, Rep. Michael N. Castle. 
In Delaware, 27,412 of the 102, 455 registered Republicans voted in the election, resulting in a 26.76 percent turn-out rate.
Campaign.
Predictions.
There were 17 news organizations who made state by state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day:
Polling.
Obama won every single pre-election poll taken in the state, and each one by a double digit margin of victory. He won the last poll by a 30 point margin.
Fundraising.
John McCain raised a total of $340,736. Barack Obama raised $1,010,740.
Advertising and visits.
No advertising was spent by either campaign. Delaware native Joe Biden campaigned here 6 times.
Analysis.
Delaware was once a noted bellwether state. It supported the winner in every presidential election from 1953 to 1996. However, it broke this trend in 2000, when Al Gore carried it by 13 points. It supported John Kerry by a slightly narrower margin in 2004, and is now reckoned as part of the solid bloc of blue states in the Northeast. The last Republican to win Delaware was George H. W. Bush in 1988. Obama was already favored to win Delaware going into the election. However, what little chance McCain had of winning the state ended when Biden joined the Democratic ticket.
In recent years, any discussion of statewide elections in Delaware has begun and ended with New Castle County, home to the state's largest city, Wilmington. Part of the Northeast megalopolis and the Philadelphia metropolitan area, New Castle contains 55 percent of Delaware's population and elects a substantial majority of the Delaware General Assembly. New Castle has turned almost solidly Democratic in recent years, mirroring the trend in the rest of the Northeast. The state's other two counties, Kent (home to the state capital, Dover) and Sussex, are more rural and more Republican, but combined have less than half of New Castle's population. In 1992, 2000 and 2004, the Republican candidate carried Kent and Sussex, but lost New Castle by double digits—enough of a margin to swing the entire state to the Democrats. The 2008 election was no different. Obama carried New Castle by over 104,000 votes, which would have been more than enough to carry the state.
With Biden on the ticket, Democrats had a very good year down ballot as well. The Democrats continued their 15-year run in the Governor's Mansion as State Treasurer Jack Markell was elected with 67.52% of the vote over Republican Bill Lee. Incumbent Ruth Ann Minner was barred from a third term. Democrats picked up two seats in the Delaware Senate and seven seats in the Delaware House of Representatives. The latter victory gave the Democrats control of the state house for the first time since 1987, and gave the Democrats complete control of state government for the first time since the 1970s.
Results breakdown.
By congressional district.
Due to the state's low population, only one congressional district is allocated. This district, called the At-Large district, because it covers the entire state, and thus is equivalent to the statewide election results.
Electors.
Technically the voters of Delaware cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Delaware is allocated 3 electors because it has 1 congressional district and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 3 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 3 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for President and Vice President. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.
The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 15, 2008 to cast their votes for President and Vice President. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.
The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 3 were pledged to Barack Obama and Joe Biden:

Serpents Trail

The Serpents Trail in Colorado National Monument, also known as the Trail of the Serpents and the Serpentine Trail, was built by the visionary John Otto, who began the campaign to establish the national monument. The trail was, in fact, a road from Grand Junction, Colorado through No Thoroughfare Canyon to the rimrock near Cold Shivers Point, with an elevation gain of nearly 1100 feet over 2.5 miles. From Cold Shivers Point the road proceeded at a gentler grade for four miles to Glade Park. Otto began his survey in 1911 with the help of civil engineer J.F. Sleeper. Otto's grand plan was to link Grand Junction to Moab, Utah by a scenic road to be part of a transcontinental road system. Construction began in 1912 and continued sporadically to 1921, when Mesa County took the project over. Engineer J.B. Clabaugh completed the project in 1924.
The construction of the Rim Rock Drive destroyed portions of the Serpents Trail. A 1.6 mile portion has been preserved as a hiking trail. During the 1930s the Park Service considered upgrading the trail to a higher standard of road, but dropped the project. Only the relatively gentle upper section of the trail was incorporated into Rim Rock Drive in 1939-40.

Mako Guard District

The was the major navy base for the Imperial Japanese Navy in Taiwan before and during World War II. Located in at Mako ), (present-day Makung, Pescadores Islands, Republic of China), the Mako Guard District was responsible for control of the strategic Straits of Taiwan and for patrols along the Taiwan and China coastlines and in the South China Sea. It was disbanded in 1943, and reestablished as the Takao Guard District at Takao on the Taiwan main island. 
History.
The were second tier naval bases, similar to the first tier , with docking, fueling and resupply facilities, but typically lacked a shipyard or training school. They tended to be established by strategic waterways or major port cities for defensive purposes. In concept, the Guard District was similar to the United States Navy Sea Frontiers concept. the Guard District maintained a small garrison force of ships and Naval Land Forces which reported directly to the Guard District commander, and hosted detachments of the numbered fleets on a temporary assignment basis.
The port of Mako in the Pescadores Islands was an area with a long association with the Imperial Japanese Navy, having been the first portion of Taiwan captured during the Japanese invasion of Taiwan in the First Sino-Japanese War. Mako was designated a third echelon naval port, or on 4 July 1901. It served as a staging point and refueling base in the Russo-Japanese War, and especially during the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War. 
Mako was upgraded to full Guard District status on 20 November 1941, and served as a staging group and supply base for the invasion of the Philippines and other naval operations in Southeast Asia after the start of the Pacific War. In 1943, the base was relocated to Takao on the Taiwanese mainland.

Patsy Cline posthumous discography

The posthumous discography of Patsy Cline, an American country music artist, consist of three studio albums, three live albums, nineteen compilation albums, one soundtrack, four video albums, and thirty five singles. For material released during the artist's lifetime, see Patsy Cline discography.
Between January and February 1963, Cline had been recording new material intended for a fourth studio album to be released in April entitled, "Faded Love." Because of her death on March 5, 1963, her label, Decca instead released the double compilation album, "The Patsy Cline Story" that June. The album peaked at #9 on the "Billboard Magazine" Top Country Albums list and #74 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, certifying platinum in United States by the 1980s. Three singles released that year became Top 10 hits on the country chart in 1963: "Leavin' on Your Mind", "Sweet Dreams (of You)", and "Faded Love". Decca also released two posthumous studio albums in 1964 of previously unreleased material: "A Portrait of Patsy Cline" and "That's How a Heartache Begins." The latter produced the charting single, "He Called Me Baby," released at the end of 1964. In 1967, Decca issued "Patsy Cline's Greatest Hits," which debuted at #17 on the "Billboard" Country Albums Chart. The album became the highest-selling female country album for the twenty eight years until Shania Twain surpassed her record in 1995. "Greatest Hits" was reissued three additional times and eventually was certified diamond in sales in the United States. Cline's label would continually release singles between 1965 and 1973, including a cover version of "Anytime," which was her only charting single from those releases.
In 1980, MCA Records (which Decca later was called) overdubbed Cline's original vocals on selected songs for the album, "Always." It spawned a version of "Always," which reached #18 on the "Billboard" Country Chart. In 1981, RCA and MCA records created electronically produced duets between Cline and deceased country artist, Jim Reeves. Their cover of Ernest Tubb's "Have You Ever Been Lonely (Have You Ever Been Blue)" reached #5 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart, and a cover of Cline's, "I Fall to Pieces" from the compilation, "Remembering Patsy Cline & Jim Reeves" reached #54. In 1985 a biopic about Cline's life entitled, "Sweet Dreams" was released, spawning a soundtrack of the same name to be issued, which certified gold in the United States. Cline's vocals were again overdubbed on the film's soundtrack. The movie brought renewed interest to her recordings, and MCA therefore issued a series of compilations during the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s. This included 1985's "Heartaches" (which certified platinum), "Songwriter's Tribute" (1986), "The Last Sessions" (1988), and "Faded Love" (1988). MCA also released an album of live material recorded at the Grand Ole Opry, which was entitled, "Live at the Opry." In 1991, MCA released the box set, "The Patsy Cline Collection," which certified platinum and also peaked at #29 on "Billboard" Top Country Albums and #166 on the "Billboard 200" charts. Today it is one of highest-selling country music box sets.
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, additional labels released compilation albums of Cline's material. In 1989, Rhino Records released three separate volumes of her 1950s recordings at Four Star Records. In 1990, her original version of "Crazy" reached #14 in the United Kingdom, and "I Fall to Pieces" peaked at #87. Both songs were then included on her 1992 British compilation, "The Definitive Patsy Cline." In 1995 the MCA compilation, "Patsy Cline Sings Songs of Love" sold one million records in the United States. In 1999, Mercury Records released "Patsy Cline Duets, Volume 1," which peaked at #67 on the Top Country Albums chart. In addition it spawned two singles including an overdubbed version of "There He Goes" with John Berry, which peaked at #70. In 2004, MCA's "The Definitive Collection" peaked at #52 on the "Billboard" Country Albums chart, and "Patsy Cline Gold" (2005) reached #43. Patsy Cline has sold 15 million records posthumously according to the Recording Industry Association of America.

<doc id="20687914" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20687914" title="Murdering Gully massacre">
Murdering Gully massacre

Murdering Gully, formerly known as Puuroyup to the Djargurd Wurrung people, is the site of an 1839 massacre of 35-40 people of the "Tarnbeere Gundidj" clan of the Djargurd Wurrung in the Camperdown district of Victoria, Australia. It is a gully on Mount Emu Creek, where a small stream adjoins from Station.
Of particular note for this massacre is the extent of oral history and first hand accounts of the incident and detail in settler diaries, records of Weslayan missionaries, and Aboriginal Protectorate records. Following the massacre there was popular disapproval and censure of the leading perpetrator, Frederick Taylor, so that Taylor's River was renamed to Mount Emu Creek. The massacre effectively destroyed the Tarnbeere Gundidj clan.
Cause.
The massacre was undertaken by Frederick Taylor and others in retaliation for some sheep being killed by two unidentified Aborigines, as reported by one of Taylor's shepherds. As Aboriginal clans were pushed from their lands, their traditional foods of kangaroo and emu became much more scarce forcing Aborigines to kill sheep to fend off starvation. A common resistance tactic against the European invasion and dispossession was an economic war to drive sheep off and to kill sheep for food. However, George Robinson, the Chief Protector of Aborigines, in a letter to Assistant Protector Charles Sievwright on 11 July 1839, questions Taylor's allegation saying
The Massacre.
Frederick Taylor, the manager at Glenormiston station, with associates James Hamilton and Bloomfield led a group of several shepherds in their employ and attacked a sleeping aboriginal camp, firing upon and killing men, women and children. Several aborigines were able to escape and later told their accounts to Assistant Protector Sievwright, and Weslayan missionaries Benjamin Hurst and Francis Tuckfield. The bodies were dumped in the waterhole and later burnt by some accounts.
Taylor had formerly been implicated in the killing of Woolmudgin from the Wathaurong people on 17 October 1836, and had fled to Van Diemen's Land to avoid interview and possible prosecution in that case.
In a deposition by Edward Williamson, overseer to the Weslayan Buntingdale Mission establishment at Birregurra, outlines the events of the massacre as reported to him by Wore-gu-i-moni:
Charles Sievwright collected another witness statement from Wan-geg-a-mon relating to the murder of his wife and child in the massacre:
Oral history collected by James Dawson in 1881, told of Bareetch Chuurneen (alias Queen Fanny the chieftess of the clan) escaping with a child but pursued to Wuurna Weewheetch (the home of the swallow) on the west side of Lake Bullen Merri. With the child on her back she swam across the lake to finally escape her pursuers.
Aftermath.
Glenormiston station was purchased by Niel Black in 1840, who wrote in his journal:
Black maintained the dispossession and native terror engendered by the massacre by driving Djargurd Wurrung people from his run, pulling down any miam-miams (bark shelters) he found and leaving gunpowder to show as a warning sign.
Taylor, fearing prosecution for the massacre, in late 1839 or early 1840 fled to the obscurity of India for a few years. He returned to Victoria and in June 1844 was managing a station on the Mitchell River near Lindenow. When Taylor applied to take up his own run in Gippsland, the Commissioner of Crown Lands, Charles Tyers, refused to grant any land citing Taylor's treatment of aborigines in the Western District. Taylor appealed to Governor Charles La Trobe requesting:
La Trobe reviewed the case over subsequent months, including the evidence collected by Charles Sievwright and forwarded by Chief Protector of Aborigines George Robinson, and upheld Tyer's decision. Despite this decision Taylor became a joint licence holder of Lindenow with the Loughnans in 1845. In March 1846 La Trobe informed the Colonial Secretary that all charges against Taylor had "ended in satisfactory disproval".
For the next 13 years Taylor continued to hold licences for land in Gippsland along the Mitchell and Tambo rivers, around Lake Victoria and Lake King, and at Swan Reach, where he continued with a campaign of dispossession of the Gunai people.

Bill Green (hammer thrower)

William ("Bill") Green (born April 28, 1960) is a former United States record holder in Track and Field, who finished 5th in the hammer throw in the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, California.
Personal life and family.
Bill Green grew up in the Silicon Valley region of the San Francisco Bay Area, graduating from Fremont High School in Sunnyvale, California in 1978, and California State University, Long Beach in 1984 with a bachelors degree in Political Science. He is married to Julie Green and has two children, William John Jr. ("Jack") and Victoria ("Tori"). The family currently resides permanently in the Napa Valley and part-time in the Lake Tahoe community of Fallen Leaf Lake.
Green is the son of William Hipkiss, a prominent attorney and actor in community theater who in the 1970s and 1980s performed in over 20 productions at the Frauenthal Center for the Performing Arts in Muskegon, Michigan and other parts of Western Michigan. His mother is Barbara Green, former mayor and city councilwoman in the historical Lake Tahoe town of Truckee, California, who also served one term as County Supervisor for Nevada County, California. Bill was adopted at age 5 by Barbara Green's second husband Kenneth Green, and raised in California since the age of 3. Ken Green was an engineer educated at Stanford University, with undergraduate and master's degrees in both mechanical and petroleum engineering, and was the son of Stanford professors.
Athletic career.
Green was asked by the Fremont High School (Sunnyvale, CA) coaching staff to try out for the sport of Track and Field, based upon observations made in a physical education weightlifting class. A discus thrower for two years in high school who failed to qualify for the California state meet, he was recruited by renowned throwing coach Art Venegas near the beginning of his career. Venegas would later develop 33 national champions in 28 years as assistant and head coach at UCLA, a record never approached by any other university. Encouragement to try the hammer throw as a college freshman resulted in an NCAA All American designation and an AAU National Junior Champion title in 1979 in just five months with the event, and a ranking of third in the United States at the senior level three years later in 1982.
Green competed at the height of hammer throw performance historically, a time when the event was dominated by the Eastern Bloc communist sports system.
Technical advancements in the hammer throw pioneered by the Soviet Union in the late 1970s were increasing distances at a furious pace by the early 1980s and the complex biomechanics of these changes, which evolved the hammer throw from a strength event to a focus on speed, were not well understood in other parts of the world. Based on experience competing against Russian prodigy Igor Nikulin at the USA vs USSR Junior National Team competitions in 1979, an athlete who go on to become one of history's all-time performers and an Olympic medalist in 1992, Green and Venegas believed they could adopt the new technical changes and reestablish the United States as a viable competitor internationally after more than 25 years with no Americans on the Olympic podium. In 1983 and 1984 he set three American Collegiate Records, three United States National Records, and placed 5th at the 1984 Olympic Games. He is one of only three Americans since 1952 to place in the top six in Olympic competition, and his performance in Los Angeles established a prelude to the country's first Olympic medal in 40 years with Lance Deal's 2nd place finish in the 1996 Atlanta Games.
Endorsements and media appearances.
He appeared in television shows, commercials, print advertisements and did product endorsement for such companies as Eastman Kodak, The Hershey Company (Care Free gum), the Ford Motor Company, Mazda, Seafirst Bank, Mizuno Corp., and Nike, Inc. Green also worked as a consultant to actor and filmmaker Danny DeVito, who produced, directed and starred in the children's movie "Matilda", based upon the final novel by best-selling British author Roald Dahl. His work on the film included adviser for actress Pam Ferris, whose character in the story Miss Agatha Trunchbull had been an Olympic hammer thrower.
Retirement from athletics.
Green became disillusioned with the lack of support and training resources necessary for an American athlete to challenge in an area of sports dominated by the Eastern Bloc athletic system at the height of its success in the 1980s. This factor, combined with the belief that drug use was required to medal at a second Olympic Games and a limited interest in the event in the United States, eroded his enthusiasm for Track and Field.
In August 1987, he became embroiled in a controversy generating international headlines when he was disqualified for doping at the Pan American Games in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he won the silver medal. According to one of Green's lawyers, under threat of litigation for violating American due process rights the general secretary of International Association of Athletics Federations allowed him to compete in the 1988 United States Olympic Trials. Without sufficient time to prepare given the delays, he did not defend his title at the 1988 Olympic Track and Field Trials or compete in the Seoul, South Korea Olympics. Green retired from Track and Field in 1987 at age 27.
He was inducted into the Long Beach State Athletic Hall of Fame in October, 2001.
Professional career.
Beginning as a trainee at the Century City, California office of international insurance broker Johnson & Higgins, he became a sales and marketing executive with the The SCPIE Companies (a division of Johnson and Higgins). Until it was sold in 2009, the Southern California Physicians Insurance Exchange (SCPIE) was the largest largest provider of medical liability insurance in California. He served as Vice President of Sales at SCPIE until 2006, and later held the same title at The Doctors Company in Napa, California. He has been Director of Marketing for the Medical Insurance Exchange of California (MIEC) in Oakland, California since 2010).

Saddlehorn Utility Area Historic District

The Saddlehorn Utility Area Historic District in Colorado National Monument comprises a complex of park service buildings, designed by the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Designs in the National Park Service Rustic style. The primary designer was National Park Service architect Kenneth M. Saunders, who employed the local red sandstone in the buildings, which included shops, fuel shed, repair and storage buildings. The buildings were constructed in 1941 by Public Works Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps labor.
The utility area is located at the intersection of Rim Rock Drive and the Saddle horn Loop, named after a distinctive nearby rock formation. It is separated from the caretaker's house by a low hill. Construction was carried out by craftsmen, known as LEM's (Local Experienced Men), with suitable skills, reputedly stonemasons of Italian descent. Much of the material came from Rim Rock Drive construction.
The three Saddlehorn National Register properties were nominated to the National Register of Historic Places as a multiple property submission on the basis of their related design and history. The utility area was built by CCC camp NM-2-C.

Pine Cone (Fabergé egg)

The Pine Cone egg is a jewelled enameled Easter egg made under the supervision of the Russian jeweller Peter Carl Fabergé in 1900. The egg was made for Alexander Kelch, who presented it to his wife, Barbara (Varvara) Kelch-Bazanova.
Craftmanship.
The egg was created by workmaster Mikhail Perkhin (Russian, 1860–1903) and is crafted of gold, silver, rose-cut diamonds, brilliant diamonds and translucent royal blue enamel. The miniature elephant is made of silver, gold, ivory, rose-cut diamonds and red and green enamel. One end of the pine cone, a symbol of resurrection, is set with four petal-shaped portrait diamonds, forming a quatrefoil enclosing the date "1900". The opposite end is set with a rose-cut diamond star, enclosing a portrait diamond over a later miniature of a young woman. The Egg originally bore the monogram B.K.(for Barbara Kelch) beneath the portrait diamond, probably similar to that of the 1899 Kelch Twelve Panel egg. The egg shell opens to reveal, in a fitted velvet compartment, a surprise, an oxidized silver Indian elephant automaton with ivory tusks supporting an enameled turbaned mahout seated upon a gold fringed red and green guilloche enamel saddle cloth. Each side is set with three rose-cut diamond collets, one covers a keyhole. When wound with the original gold key, the tiny elephant, lumbers forward, shifting its weight from one side to the other, all the while turning its head and flicking its tail. The egg has a height of 9.5 cm.
Ownership.
One of the six Kelch Eggs sold to Morgan in Paris by A La Vieille Russie. The Egg was sold in 1929 to a private United States collector. Sold in 1989 by Christie's Geneva to Joan Kroc (widow of Ray Kroc, former chairman of McDonalds Corporation) of San Diego, California for $3.1 million. Daniel Grossman, a New York art dealer, represented Joan Kroc at the sale and he stayed on the telephone with her throughout the bidding. Mrs. Kroc later told the New York Times "I was thrilled when I was told I had bought the egg." She had recently pledged $1 million to San Diego's 1989 three week arts festival "Treasures of the Soviet Union" and the Egg was the 26th Faberge egg at the festival. In 1997 the egg was offered by Christie's in New York from the collection of Joan Kroc, but did not sell with the highest bid of $2.8 million. The presale estimate was $3.5 to 4.5 million.

Cellana sandwicensis

Cellana sandwicensis, common name the yellow-foot opihi, is a species of edible true limpet, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Nacellidae, one of the families of true limpets.
Distribution.
This species is endemic to the islands of Hawaii.
"C. sandwicensis" has been found in Taiwanese coastal waters, possibly spread by larvae transported in ship ballast water.
Habitat.
This limpet lives lower in the intertidal zone than "Cellana exarata", the black-foot opihi. They are found, strongly attached, sometimes with considerable force, with their foot to rocks or other hard substrates. They feed by grazing on algae.
Description.
The large, muscular foot of the animal is yellow in the center but gray on its margin. The white head is short with one pair of tentacles with dark pigments on the backside. The flattened shell is dark green on the outside and silvery white on the inside. Its shape is almost oval and its apex is situated somewhat lower than the central. The ribs radiate from the central and extend beyond the margin.
Human use.
This species is used as a food item. It is considered a higher quality food than the black-foot opihi.
Legislation.
In 2009, the Hawaii Legislature approved a bill that would have banned the harvest of opihi (limpets) on the island of Oahu for five years. The bill was successfully vetoed by governor Linda Lingle.

United States presidential election in West Virginia, 2008

The 2008 United States presidential election in West Virginia took place on November 4, 2008 throughout all 50 states and D.C., which was part of the 2008 United States presidential election. Voters chose 5 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.
West Virginia was won by Republican nominee John McCain by a 13.1% margin of victory. Prior to the election, all 17 news organizations considered this a state McCain would win, or otherwise considered as a safe red state. Despite its past voting record of heavily favoring Democratic presidential nominees, the state has lately been trending more Republican in presidential elections. As expected, McCain defeated Obama in the Mountain State, even improving upon George W. Bush's performance in 2004. West Virginia was one of five states in which McCain did better than Bush. Obama was also the first Democratic presidential nominee since Woodrow Wilson in 1916 to win the nationwide presidential election without carrying West Virginia.
Campaign.
Predictions.
There were 17 news organizations who made state by state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day:
Polling.
McCain won 16 of 17 pre-election polls. The final 3 polls averaged McCain leading 53% to 41%.
Fundraising.
John McCain raised a total of $291,184 in the state. Barack Obama raised $713,231.
Advertising and visits.
Obama and his interest groups spent $1,437,178. McCain and his interest groups spent $1,920,720. Each ticket visited the state once.
Analysis.
More than any other state, West Virginia highlighted Obama's trouble in Appalachian America. It swung heavily to the Democrats during the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt and remained reliably Democratic for most of the next 68 years. It often voted for Democrats (such as Jimmy Carter and Mike Dukakis) who went on to big national defeats. This was largely due to its blue-collar, heavily unionized workers, especially coal miners, who favored Democratic economic policy. 
Starting in the days with Al Gore, however, the state's voters became more concerned with cultural issues, which made them more receptive to Republicans. Barack Obama, a big-city liberal African American intellectual from Chicago, was the most ill-fitting Democratic presidential nominee in West Virginia since George McGovern. As was witnessed throughout the course of the Democratic Primary, Obama continuously struggled among blue-collar, white working-class voters that are abundant in Appalachia. These Reagan Democrats, as they are sometimes called, are socially conservative and fiscally moderate populists and are prevalent throughout West Virginia. During the Democratic Primary he lost West Virginia by 40 percentage points to former U.S. Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, a more traditional Democrat far better suited for the voters in Appalachia. Her husband, Bill Clinton, carried West Virginia by double digits during both of his elections.
Advancing into the general election, McCain was largely expected to receive the state's five electoral votes. Since polling in the state prior to the election showed a nearly double-digit lead in favor of McCain, neither presidential nominee campaigned heavily in the state. Not surprisingly, though, every poll out of West Virginia showed Hillary Clinton defeating McCain in West Virginia, sometimes by double digits. 
On Election Day, McCain won West Virginia by 13.09 points while losing nationwide. McCain did well throughout the state, losing only a handful of counties. While his margins were best in the more conservative northern part of the state, he also improved significantly in Southern West Virginia. This coal-mining, union-heavy region was one of the most heavily Democratic places in the nation; Logan County, for example, cast 72 percent of its ballot for Bill Clinton. In 2008, however, John McCain won the county by double-digits. 
On the other hand, Barack Obama did make gains in the area between Maryland and Virginia, counties which are a part of the Washington Metropolitan Area. Obama also ran close in Central West Virginia (the counties around the capital Charleston).
Despite the recent Republican success nationally, Democrats still dominate at the state and local level. After Election 2008, Democrats hold the governorship and every statewide office, two out of the state's three congressional districts in the U.S. House of Representatives and both U.S. Senate seats. They also hold supermajorities in both chambers of the state legislature.
During the same election, popular incumbent Democratic Governor Joe Manchin III was soundly reelected to a second term with 69.79% of the vote over Republican Russ Weeks who took in 25.75% while Jesse Johnson of the Mountain Party received 4.46%. Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Jay Rockefeller IV was also soundly reelected with 63.71% of the vote over Republican Jay Wolfe who took in 36.27%. At the state level, Democrats picked up three seats in the West Virginia Senate while Republicans picked up one seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates.
Results breakdown.
By congressional District.
John McCain swept all three of the state’s three congressional districts, including the two districts held by Democrats. 
Electors.
Technically the voters of West Virginia cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. West Virginia is allocated 5 electors because it has 3 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 5 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 5 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for President and Vice President. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.
The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 15, 2008 to cast their votes for President and Vice President. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.
All 5 were pledged to John McCain and Sarah Palin:

History.
Prompted by a school board decision at La Grande High School to end plans for a production of "Picasso at the Lapin Agile", playwright Steve Martin wrote a letter to "The Observer" about the controversy, saying that he "could understand how some parents might object to certain lines if they were to be delivered by a 16- or 17-year-old" but he "believe that the spirit of the play and its endorsement of the arts and sciences are appropriate for young eyes and minds"; in order to "prevent the play from acquiring a reputation it does not deserve" he offered to "finance a non-profit, off-high school campus production ... so that individuals, outside the jurisdiction of the school board but within the guarantees of freedom of expression provided by the Constitution of the United States, can determine whether they will or will not see the play, even if they are under 18."
In 2012 the newspaper reduced its frequency to three days a week, publishing issues on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

Asterix at the Olympic Games (film)

Asterix at the Olympic Games () is a French film, based on characters from René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo's Astérix comic series. It was filmed essentially in Spain in the course of the year 2006. At the time of its release, it was the most expensive French film of all time. The film has been poorly received by critics, but performed well at several European box offices, topping charts in Poland, Spain and France. In May 2008 it received the "Gérard du cinéma" (French equivalent of the Razzie Awards) for "Worst French film made in 2007."
Plot.
Astérix and Obélix have to win the Olympic Games in order to help their friend Lovesix (Stéphane Rousseau) marry Princess Irina (portrayed by Vanessa Hessler). Brutus (Benoît Poelvoorde) uses every trick in the book to have his own team win the game, and get rid of his father Julius Caesar (Alain Delon) in the process, but fails.
The film is very loosely adapted from the original "Asterix at the Olympic Games" comic book. The love story subplot between Lovesix and Irina was not featured in the original story. Brutus, portrayed here as a comical villain with no relation to his depictions in Asterix comics, is the main antagonist, although he was not even featured as a character in the original comic book.
Cast.
There is a cameo of Adriana Karembeu as Mrs Geriatrix (replacing Arielle Dombasle in the first film), and Jamel Debbouze reprises his role as Numerobis. German comedy star and director Michael Bully Herbig has a bit-part as a mute Roman soldier.
The film featured several cameos by real-life sport stars, such as Michael Schumacher, Jean Todt, Zinedine Zidane, Tony Parker, and Amélie Mauresmo. The part of Roman athlete Claudius Cornedurus (Gluteus Maximus), played by Jérôme Le Banner, was originally to be played by Jean-Claude Van Damme.
Production.
Filming took place in Alicante, Spain and lasted six months. 
Box office.
The film grossed $23.4 million in France in its opening weekend, which was more than 60% of its gross in 19 territories in which the film was released. Box Office Mojo estimated $38.7 million in revenue within a week after the film was released.

Darling House Museum

The Darling House Museum is a historic house museum located in Woodbridge, Connecticut, and is owned and operated by the Amity & Woodbridge Historical Society. The house is open by appointment and during special events.
In the early 1770s, Thomas Darling hired Abiel Gray of West Hartford, Connecticut to build a new home in Amity Parish, outside of New Haven. Gray took two years (1772-1774) to finish the project. The house has a gambrel roof, is built on a central hall plan and has some unusual features. Paneling and woodwork in the hallway and front rooms are richly detailed under 9-foot, 3-inch ceilings. The influence of 18th-century New York is suggested by the imported tiles of Biblical scenes over one fireplace. 
Much of the furniture and many items in the home were owned by the Darling family, which owned the house and surrounding land until 1973, when the property was sold to the town of Woodbridge and the Amity & Woodbridge Historical Society began caring for the structure. The property includes a large 18th century barn, a 19th century horse barn, a carriage shed, a chicken coop, a pig house, and a 19th century privy. 
The town maintains several fields near the house, and some easy walking trails skirt the base of West Rock. 
The Society has a large collection of farm implements on display in the horse barn. Quilts, linens, and period clothing are also displayed in the house.

Nazareth Catholic College, Adelaide

Nazareth Catholic College is a Roman Catholic, independent, co-educational, day school, located across two campuses: a Primary Campus in Findon, and a Secondary Campus in Flinders Park; suburbs approximately 5.3 kilometres north-west of the centre of Adelaide, South Australia. The College is part of the larger organisation Nazareth Catholic Community.
The College was established in January 2007 with the amalgamation of Siena College (Findon), Cardinia Catholic School (Flinders Park), Mater Christi School (Seaton), and Our Lady of the Manger School (Findon). 
The Findon Primary Campus caters for approximately 720 students while the Flinders Park Secondary Campus caters for 987 students, a total of 1660 students, Early Childhood Centre (ECC) to Year 12, across the two campuses.
Nazareth Catholic College is a member of the Sports Association for Adelaide Schools.
History.
Nazareth Catholic College was established in January 2007 with the amalgamation of three neighbouring Catholic Primary Schools and Siena College.
At the time of its inception in 2007 the Secondary College consisted of a predominately female population, as the Secondary College had previously been Siena College, a school for girls. In 2011 the first co-educational cohort of Year 12 students graduated from the College.
As an essentially new College, Nazareth Catholic College underwent significant building works on both campuses. In 2011 the Primary Campus completed a multipurpose space and gym funded by the Building the Education (BER) funding provided by the Australian Government. In the same year the Secondary Campus at Flinders Park completed a Music Centre with additional classrooms built above the new Music Centre as well as additional classrooms in place of the previous Music Centre.
In 2012 an additional Technology workshop was created from an existing classrooms as was a Textiles Room from a previous storage area at the Secondary Campus.
In 2013 another learning space was created in the Secondary College Library, with additional transportable classrooms added. With funding received from the Australian Government the Secondary Campus added new ventilation, skylights and lighting in the existing gym.
Leadership Structure (Secondary).
To cater for the growth in student numbers as the College became more established, the Secondary College employed additional personnel in College leadership roles. At the time of its inception in 2007 the Secondary Campus Leadership structure consisted of the Secondary Co-Principal, one Deputy Principal as well as Positions of Responsibility such as the Director of Daily Administration and Director of Curriculum.
In 2011 to facilitate growing student numbers a second Deputy Principal was employed at the Secondary Campus with one Deputy Principal responsible for the oversight of the Curriculum and the other for Administration and Pastoral Care matters.
In 2012 additional personnel were employed in Positions of Responsibility. The Director of Administration position was maintained while the Director of Curriculum was renamed to Director of Student Learning, and the additional positions of Director of Student Development, which was responsible for the oversight of then newly structured college Mentor Group programme, and the Director of Learning Technologies (R-12), which had oversight of the Secondary College timetable, as well as learning technologies across both the Primary and Secondary School campuses.
Until the end of 2012 there was a single position of Assistant to the Principal in Religious Identity and Mission, more commonly known as an APRIM employed by the College.
In 2013 were two APRIMs employed by the College, one at the Primary School Campus at Findon and the other at the Secondary Campus at Flinders Park. The position of Director of Student Development was also expanded to include the previous role of Year 12 Coordinator/Events Manager, which was responsible for the oversight of the College Formal, Graduation and other Year 12 specific matters, and Student Leadership Coordinator, responsible for the coordination of the College Student Leaders.
School Structure.
Nazareth Catholic College is divided into two "sub-schools":
Students and Staff are allocated into one of five "houses", which are used for school events such as sports day. The houses are as follows:
Pastoral Care and Mentor Group Programme (Secondary).
At the College's beginning in 2007 the Secondary Pastoral Care structure consisted of 30 Pastoral Care groups of approximately 25 students divided equally amongst the five College Houses.
In 2010 it was decided to move to a vertical grouping structure where each of the then renamed 35 Mentor Groups, which had also increased in number due to the increase in student population, would consist of students from Years 8 to 12. This vertical grouping structure continues to the present day under the philosophy that students can learn from both older and younger students and provides a sense of continuity to students as the same Mentor Group teacher is maintained from year to year where possible.
In 2011 the College adopted the MindMatters programme with a particular focus on mental health. During this same year the College became a MindMatters school, recognising its positive steps toward mental health prevention and education across the College.
In 2012 there were 40 Mentor Groups divided equally amongst the five houses.
Five Habits of Nazareth.
In 2012 the College adopted a philosophy to highlight the expectations of the College to students and the wider community, known as the '"Five Habits of Nazareth". These are:
These serve as a basis through which it is expected that all students can achieve personal excellence. These Habits of Excellence are strictly monitored by the College through the College Mentor Group programme.
Curriculum.
The Nazareth Catholic College curriculum follows a framework that covers the eight nationally recognised key learning areas: English, Mathematics, Science, Society and Environment, Languages, Arts, Health and Physical Education and Technology. As with other Australian Schools these subjects conform to the requirements of the Australian Curriculum and the South Australian Curriculum Standards and Accountability (SACSA) Framework.
From Reception to Year 7, students study core subjects of English, Mathematics, Science, Design and Technology, Visual Arts, Drama, Dance and Music, Studies of Society and the Environment, Health and Physical Education, as well as Religious Education, and commence studies of a second language with Italian. Japanese is offered as an additional second language for study from Year 8.
In Years 11 and 12 a full range of South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) courses are offered, as is the Vocational Education and Training module Community Studies.
Nazareth partnered with EFM Health Clubs in 2008 to add an on-site health club to the college's facilities. The facilities include a complete range of premium health and fitness equipment for curriculum use.

Pasteur point

The Pasteur point is a level of oxygen (about 0.3% by volume which is less than 1% of Present Atmospheric Level or PAL) above which aerobic microorganisms and facultative anaerobes adapt from fermentation to aerobic respiration. It is also used to mark the level of oxygen in the early atmosphere of the Earth that is believed to have led to major evolutionary changes. It is named after Louis Pasteur, the French microbiologist who studied anaerobic microbial fermentation, and is related to the Pasteur effect.
As it was previously supposed, about 400 million years ago in the Cambrian period, the level of oxygen in the atmosphere rose from 0.1 to 1 percent of present atmospheric level. This led to many organisms adapting from fermentation to respiration, leading to organisms evolving photosynthesis and what is termed the Cambrian explosion of species. It has also been suggested that this increased oxygen level reduced the influence of Ultraviolet radiation. It is now well documented that oxygen level reached at least 10% of the present value 2.4 billion years ago (for details see Great Oxygenation Event).

Browning Field

http://molineschools.org/graphics/wharton_gate.jpg
Browning Park is a park in Moline, Illinois, USA that has been the home of high school and professional athletic events since 1910. The land is deeded to the city of Moline for use as a "playground and athletic park". While the sports teams of Moline High School have been the primary tenants of the field (and the adjoining Wharton Field House), the Rock Island Independents, the only professional American football team to be charter members of two major leagues, called Browning Park its home in the 1920s, as did the minor league baseball Moline Plows. Wharton Field House was the home of the Tri-Cities Blackhawks basketball team (which later moved to Milwaukee and became the Hawks) in the late 1940s and the Quad City Thunder of the Continental Basketball Association four decades later.
As of 2013 new lights have been put around the stadium. 
[(Capacity of Browning Field - 5,600 tenants)]
Origin.
John T. Browning (1830–1910) was a lawyer who served as the City of Moline's first City Attorney. He was also a two-term State Assemblyman. In his last year of his life, Browning was planning on erecting a memorial to himself on the farmland that he owned when he was convinced by A. M. Beal, President of the Moline Board of Education, to deed the land to the city for use as an athletic park. On July 14, 1910, he added the codicil to his will, stating that his land were to be "held in trust forever by the City of Moline and dedicated to the public as and for a playground and athletic park, which shall be known and designated as the John T. Browning Park, Playground, and Athletic Field".
The next four years saw the creation of an American football/track and field stadium and a baseball field. In the late 1920s, T. F.

Anthony Ralph Epperson (born in November 1937) is an American writer and researcher of conspiracy theories. He is known for his anti-Masonic opinions.
Theories.
Epperson is a strong believer and educator in the Conspiratorial View of History, which he summarizes saying, "historical events occur by design for reasons that are not generally made known to the people." This is opposed to the view held by the majority of historians today, which is the Accidental View of History. Epperson describes the Accidental View of History saying, "historical events occur by accident, for no apparent reason. Rulers are powerless to intervene." and "no one really knows why events happen - - they just do."

ROHHAD

Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic dysfunction, Hypoventilation and Autonomic Dysregulation (ROHHAD syndrome) is a very rare disease affecting approximately only 75 cases worldwide. Patients with ROHHAD, as well as patients with Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) have damage to the mechanism governing proper breathing. ROHHAD syndrome is a disease that is potentially lethal and incurable. Fifteen patients with ROHHAD were evaluated by Diego Ize-Ludlow et al. work published in 2007.
Pathogenesis.
Central hypoventilation syndrome is a heterogeneous group of seemingly overlapping diseases. Paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) was confirmed in 2009 as the disease-causing gene in patients with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), a condition present in newborns. This genetic mutation is not present though in those with late-onset central hypoventilation syndrome and hypothalamic dysfunction.
Symptoms.
The variable presentation of ROHHAD includes the following main symptoms:
Clinically overlapping cases exist because CCHS phenotype can also include autonomic nervous system dysregulation, or tumors of neural crest origin.
Prognosis and treatment.
Currently there are no official tests or treatments for ROHHAD. Each child has the symptoms above at different ages, yet most symptoms are eventually present. Many children are misdiagnosed or are never diagnosed until alveolar hypoventilation occurs.

1971 Dhaka University massacre

Dhaka University was the centre for development of Independence of Bangladesh. Dhaka University greatly contributed to the liberation of Bangladesh.
In March 1971, the Pakistani Armed Forces chief General Yahya Khan and the politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto launched Operation Searchlight to demolish the independence demand of East Bengalis.
Black night of 25 March 1971.
The Pakistani army convoy that attacked Dhaka University on 25 March 1971 included 18 Panjabi, 22 Beluch, 32 Panjabi regiment and several battalions. Armed with heavy weapons such as tanks, automatic rifles, rocket launchers, heavy mortar, light machine gun, they encircled Dhaka University from east (unit 41), from south (unit 88) and from north (unit 26).
Massacre of teachers.
At the beginning of Operation Searchlight 10 teachers of Dhaka University were killed.
Professor Fajllur Rahman and his two relatives were killed at building 23 situated at Nilkhet. Professor Rahman’s wife escaped because she was not in the country. Pakistani army also attacked the house of Professor Anwar Pasha and Professor Rashidul Hassan (English Department). Both of them survived by hiding under beds, but were killed later on the verge of war by Al-Badar militia. Professor Rafiqul Islam of Bangla literature department was at building 24. Two wounded women with their children stayed in the entrance of the building for some time. When the army came they found blood on the stairs and, surmising that other groups had done the massacre, left. This way Professor Rafiqul escaped. Later he stated that there had been one East Pakistani professor at that building, who left home before 25 March. All other non-Bengali families did the same without informing others.
At Number 12 Fuller Road, the army called on Sayed Ali Noki (Professor Social Science). They allowed him to go but killed Professor Abdul Muktadir (Geology) who was a resident of the same building. His body was found at Jahurul Huq Hall (then Iqbal Hall). He was buried at Paltan by his relatives. Professor K. M. Munim (English Literature), the house tutor of Salimullah Student Hall, was injured at Salimullah Hall. Professors A R Khan Khadim and Sharafat Ali of Mathematics department were killed in Dhaka Hall. At Jagannath Hall they attacked teachers' residence and harassed Professor Mirja Huda (Economics) and Professor Mofijullah Kabir (History).
When Jagannath Hall, a student dormitory for minority Hindu students, was attacked, university staff quarters were also affected. The army killed Ex-Provost and famous professor of philosophy Dr Gobindra Chandra Dev with his Muslim adopted daughter’s husband. They attacked and killed Dr. A.N.M. Manirujjaman, Professor of Statistics, along with his son and two relatives. Professor Jyotirmoy Guhathakurta the provost of Jagannath Hall was severely injured by army attack and died in the hospital later. Dormitory electrician Chitrabali and eye witness Rajkumari Devi state that the doctors of Dhaka Medical College Hospital recognized Dr. Guhathakurta and buried him under a tree near Dhaka Medical College morgue.
Assistant house tutor Anudoipayon Bhattacharja was also killed at that dorm. This information was taken from the novel “Riffel Roti Awrat” (Rifle, Bread, Women) by Professor Anwar Pasha who was later killed in December. Professor Pasha wrote this famous Bengali novel during the nine-month war period of 1971.
Killing of students.
The Non-cooperation movement was organized under the banner of “Independent Bangladesh Students Movement Council” from Jahrul Hoque hall of Dhaka University. The first target of Operation Searchlight was this student hall. By 25 March all leaders of Chhatra League had left the hall. According to Professor Dr. K.M. Munim around 200 students were killed at this dorm.
After 12 o’clock the army entered Jagannath Hall and initially attacked the hall with mortar and began non-stop firing. They entered through north and south gate and killed students non-selectively from each room. Around 34 students were killed at that time. Some students of Jahannath Hall were resident of Ramna Kali Bari. So, around 5-6 were killed there. Among them only the name of Ramonimohon Bhattacharjee is known. Many guests of students who were at those dorms were also killed. Including Helal of Bhairab college, Babul Paul of Bajitpur College, Baddruddojha of Jagannath Hall, Jibon Sarkar, Mostaq, Bacchu and Amar of Netrokona. Archer Blood, the then consul general of US at Dhaka, wrote in his book "The Cruel Birth of Bangladesh", "Fire was started at Rokeya Hall (girls' dormitory) and, when the students tried to escape, the military started firing. From the conversation of military control room and army unit 88, a total of 300 students death was estimated."

Attack at girls' dormitory.
Archer K. Blood the then consul general of US at Dhaka wrote in his book The Cruel Birth of Bangladesh, "Fire was started at Rokeya Hall (girls' dormitory) and, when the students tried to escape, the military started firing... On 10 November 1971 some armed criminals attacked Rokeya Hall and kept 30 girls confined for two hours. They also attacked Provost House”. In 1971 there were two strong military establishments near Rokeya hall, it was impossible to attack university Girls' Hostel without their knowledge for two hours.
Excerpts from Genocide in Bangladesh by Kalyan Chaudhury, pp 157–158: “...Some army officer raided Rokeya Hall on 7 October 1971. Accompanied by five soldiers, Major Aslam had first visited the hostel on 3 October and asked the superintendent to supply some girls who could sing and dance at a function to be held in Tejgaon Cantonment. The superintendent told him that most of the girls had left the hostel after the disturbances and only 40 students were residing but as a superintendent of a girls' hostel she should not allow them to go to the cantonment for this purpose. Dissatisfied, Major Aslam went away. Soon after the superintendent informed a higher army officer in the cantonment, over the telephone, of the Major' s mission. However, on 7 October at about 8 p.m. Major Aslam and his men raided the hostel. The soldiers broke open the doors, dragged the girls out and stripped them before raping and torturing them in front of the helpless superintendent. The entire thing was done so openly without any provocation, that even the Karachi-based newspaper, Dawn, had to publish the story, violating censorship by the military authorities. In seven days after liberation about 300 girls were recovered from different places around Dacca where they had been taken away and kept confined by the Pakistani army men. On 26 December altogether 55 emaciated and half-dead girls on the verge of mental derangement were recovered by the Red Cross with the help of the Mukti Bahini and the allied forces from various hideouts of the Pakistani army in Narayanganj, Dacca Cantonment and other small towns on the periphery of Dacca city."
Academic activities at 1971.
Governor Tikka Khan ordered department heads to join work from 21 April and the other teachers on 1 June. According to his order, classes must be started from 2 August. All the dormitories were cleaned to remove any signs of destruction to show a quite fine educational environment at the university to the international communities. All exams were postponed due to the national crisis. Attendance in the class was to minute at that period. Interestingly, as the forces of war increased until September, attendance in the classes also increased. As many students had joined the Mukti Bahini (liberation force), they blasted hand grenades near the university and quickly entered classes. This is why the army failed to arrest any one.
Warning, arresting and punishment of teachers.
For known connections with liberation force, Tikka Khan issued arrest orders against many teachers and arrested some of them. Among them there were Dr. Abul Khayer, Dr. Rafiqul Islam, Dr. K. A. M. Salauddin, Ahsanul Hoque, Giasuddin Ahmed, Jahrul Hoque and M. Shahidullah. Martial law Governor Lieutenant General Tikka Khan officially warned Professor Munir Chowdhury, Professor Nilima Ibrahim, Professor Shirajul Islam Chowdhury, and Professor Enamul Hoque. Dr. Abu Muhammah Habibullah was terminated. Professor Abdur Razzak (political scientists and later National Professor of Bangladesh) was given 14 years in jail due to supporting Bengali Independent movement.
Vice chancellor during 1971.
After March 1971 Dhaka University was without any vice chancellor. In early March the vice chancellor Justice Abu Sayed Chowdhury was at Geneva joining “United Nations Humanitarian Conference”. In the middle of March he read news about death of two students. He immediately wrote his resignation letter to State’s Education Secretary and fled to London leaving the conference. There he worked for Bangladeshi liberation. After the independence of Bangladesh, he became the country's second president.
Pakistan Army fetched Dr. Syed Sajjad Hussain the then VC of Rajshahi University in their convoy. He was made VC of Dhaka University. University teachers who helped the Pakistan government included Dr. Hasan Zaman, Dr. Mohar Ali, Dr. A. K. M. Abdur Rahman, Dr. Abdul Bari, Dr. Mukbul Hossain, Dr. Saifuddin Joarder. Collaborator and VC Dr. Syed Sajjad Hussain, Dr. Hasan Zaman and Dr. Mohar Ali were arrested after the liberation of Bangladesh and exiled.
Massacre on 14 December 1971.
In December, it became clear to the Pakistan government that it would lose the war. When Dhaka University reopened on 2 July 1971, teachers who collaborated with the Pakistani army gathered at Nawab Abdul Gani Road to build up a list of intellectuals who supported the Independence movement. Until then, the Pakistan Army secretly trained a group of Pakistan-supporting madrasa, college and university students. This group was named Al Badar. At the verge of the December war Al-Badar members came out and selectively killed Bengali professors, doctors, engineers and many other intellectuals. Many of those killed were teachers of Dhaka University.

President of Ukraine

The President of Ukraine () is the Ukrainian head of state. The President represents the nation in international relations, administers the foreign political activity of the state, conducts negotiations and concludes international treaties.
Current acting President is the current Chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament Oleksandr Turchynov after the Ukrainian Parliament ousted Viktor Yanukovych from this office on 21 February 2014. It is unclear if the removal of Yanukovych was legal because Yanukovych had not signed the bills that would restore of the Constitution as it was between 2004 and 2010, which under Article 111 would have allowed for a president to be impeached "if he commits treason or other crime." The constitutional guidelines provide for a review of the case by Ukraine's Constitutional Court and a three-fourths majority vote by parliament (338 MPs). The decisions to remove Yanukovych was supported by 328 MPs. Yanukovych still claims to be "the legitimate head of the Ukrainian state elected in a free vote by Ukrainian citizens".
Overview.
The President is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Army and heads the National Security and Defense Council, which advises the President, co-ordinates and controls the activity of bodies of executive power in the sphere of national security and defense. According to the , the president is the guarantor of the state's sovereignty, territorial indivisibility, the observance of the Constitution of Ukraine and human and citizens' rights and freedoms.
As with the separation of powers, the President has checks on the authority of parliament and the judicial system. For instance, any law passed by the parliament can be vetoed by the President; however, parliament can override his veto with a 2/3 constitutional majority vote.
The President has limited to disband the Verkhovna Rada (parliament), and nominates candidates for the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Defense in the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers. Six out of eighteen of the Constitutional Court judges are appointed by the President. Decisions of the President are subject to review by Ukraine's courts with the Constitutional Court having the sole authority and power to declare decrees of the president unconstitutional. While in office, the president enjoys the right of immunity.
The President's official residence is the Mariyinsky Palace, located in the Pechersk district of the capital Kiev. Other official residences include the House with Chimaeras and the House of the Weeping Widow, which are used for official visits by foreign representatives. The Presidential Administration of Ukraine, unofficially known as "Bankova" in reference to the street it is located on, serves as the Presidential administration, advising the President in the domestic, foreign and legal matters.
The President is directly elected by the citizens of Ukraine for a five-year term of office. A person shall not be the President of Ukraine for more than two consecutive terms.
Since the office's formation on July 5, 1991, there have been five Presidents of Ukraine. Leonid Kravchuk was the inaugural president, serving two and a half years from his official inauguration in 1992 until his resignation in 1994. Leonid Kuchma was the only President to have served two consecutive terms in office, a little over 10 years.
The third President was Viktor Yushchenko, who was elected on December 26, 2004 and inaugurated on January 23, 2005. His term of office expired on February 25, 2010. While he was eligible for re-election at the 2010 presidential election, that took place on January 17, 2010, Viktor Yushchenko's support was rated below 4% in the public opinion polls and he did not make the February 7 run-off vote. The winner of the February 7 run-off vote was Viktor Yanukovych, whose inaugural ceremony took place on February 25, 2010.
Due to recent political unrest and violence in the country, president Yanukovitch has removed himself from Kiev for the time being. The current interim president as of 23 February 2014 is newly-elected Parliamentary Speaker Aleksandr Turchinov, put in the presidential position by the parliament. MPs supporting the move argue that President Yanukovych has "de facto" resigned his office. This appointment is deemed controversial.
The President is barred by the Constitution from heading a political party.
Ukrainian Presidents are frequently asked by individual citizens for help in solving their personal problems (sometimes successfully); in 2012, President Yanukovych received about 10,000 to 12,000 letters from people every month. By-passing local governments is an ages-old practice in Ukraine.
History.
Prior to the formation of the modern Ukrainian presidency, the previous Ukrainian head of state office was officially established in exile by Andriy Livytskyi. At first the de facto leader of nation was the president of the Central Rada at early years of the Ukrainian People's Republic, while the highest governing body was the General Secretariat headed by its chairman. With the proclamation of the last universal of the UPR dated January 25, 1918 due to a military aggression, the Central Rada (council) of the UPR proclaimed its independence from the Russia. On April 29, 1918, the Rada elected Mykhailo Hrushevskyi as the first President of the Central Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic, in effect making him the "de facto" leader of the republic. Although a rather widespread misconception, the state leadership position title varied and none of them had an official "presidential" title.
On April 29, 1918 the Central Rada was arrested and liquidated during a coup d'état initiated by the local German administration to install Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky who barely spoke a word of the Ukrainian language. In November of the same year the Directorate government of the UPR was established as the opposition movement to the Skoropadsky's regime. The Ukrainian People's Republic was soon re-established in December 1918 with Volodymyr Vynnychenko as the Directorate's chairman, serving as the republic's "de facto" second "President" from December 19, 1918 to February 10, 1919. Although really the Directorate was the temporary governing body until the new Ukrainian Constituent Assembly would elect its president. Symon Petliura assumed the representation of the state after Vynnychenko's resignation on February 11, 1919 and until Petlyura's assassination in Paris on May 25, 1926.
After the Soviet invasion of Ukraine in 1920 and the control of the Ukrainian territory under pro-Soviet forces with the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, the Ukrainian People's Republic was forced into exile. Upon the assassination of Petliura by the Soviets, the control over the state affairs were transferred to the former Prime Minister Andriy Livytskyi who in 1948 created the office of the President of Ukraine. Livytskyi served as the first President (in exile) until January 1954. Stepan Vytvytskyi served after Livytskyi from January 1954 until his death on October 9, 1965. Following Vytvytskyi's death, Ivan Bahrianyi temporarily carried out the presidential authority until the third President-in-exile Mykola Livytskyi (son of the first President-in-exile) was sworn into office. Livytskyi served from 1967 until his death in December 1989.
Mykola Plaviuk was the last President-in-exile (and the fourth), serving from December 1989 until his resignation on August 22, 1992 when he ceremonially gave in his presidential authority and state symbols to the newly elected Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk at his inauguration ceremony. In his declaration, it is stated that the current Ukrainian state is the legal successor following the state traditions of the Ukrainian People's Republic, establishing the continuity of the republic.
The modern Ukrainian presidency was established on July 5, 1991 by the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which formed the office of "President of the Ukrainian SSR" (). During the transitional period until the presidential elections, the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (then held by Leonid Kravchuk) was empowered with a presidential authority. With the proclamation of Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union, the office's official title was changed to "President of Ukraine" on August 24. In the current Constitution, the Ukrainian presidency is defined in , Articles 102-112.
Elections since 1991.
So far, five presidential elections have been conducted. The first election in 1991 was held at the same time as Ukrainians voted to support the Declaration of Independence in the independence referendum. Leonid Kravchuk was elected Ukraine's first president on December 1, 1991. He was elected by a record number of voters with over 19.5 million who wanted him to see as the leader of the state. That number has not been beaten yet. His major opponents were the leader of Rukh Vyacheslav Chornovil and the author of the Declaration of Independence. President Kravchuk's remained in office until he resigned as part of a political compromise. A snap election was held in 1994, which was won by Ukraine's former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma. Kuchma was re-elected for a second term of office in 1999.
The 2004 presidential election was marked by controversy with allegations of electoral fraud in the conduct of the second round runoff ballot between opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko and the government-backed candidate and former Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych. After mass nationwide protests, colloquially known as the "Orange Revolution," a new election was held on December 26, 2004 in which Victor Yushchenko was declared the winner with 52% of the vote and was subsequently sworn into office on January 23, 2005.
The last election took place on January 17, 2010 with a run-off on February 7, 2010 due to a May 13 Constitutional Court ruling striking down the October 25 date that the parliament called in April 2009. As a result of this election Viktor Yanukovych was elected the fourth modern president of Ukraine.

As per the checks and balances system of Ukrainian government, the President can veto laws adopted by the Verkhovna Rada (except constitutional amendments). The President wields high power in the legislative branch of government compared to other European heads of state. They may disband the parliament and call for early elections.

Since September 2011 the President of Ukraine is also head of the National Anti-Corruption Committee, while the Justice Minister serves as the secretary of this committee. The committee tasks include a systematic analysis of corruption in Ukraine and the development of measures to combat corruption.
Privileges of office.
An election as President of Ukraine garners many privileges of office to an individual. Full legal immunity is granted from all prosecutions and legal proceedings, excluding parliament's right to impeach the president. The title of President of Ukraine itself is protected by law and is reserved for the president for life, unless they have been impeached from office.

It is colloquially known as "Bankova", because it is located on Bankova Street in a massive building across from the House with Chimaeras. The head of the administration, the Chief Secretary, acts as the gray cardinal for the president in Ukrainian politics. Around fourteen state residences are allocated for official Presidential use, many of which remain from the Kuchma-era presidency. The official ceremonial residence is the Mariyinsky Palace in Kiev. Other state residences include the House with Chimaeras and the House of the Weeping Widow in Kiev, the Yusupov Palace in the Crimea Mezhigorye residence and Sinegora in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast.

A lot of additional material-technical, social-communal, health care provision support is offered by the State Department of Affairs (abbreviated as DUS) that is created for state officials and subordinated to the President of Ukraine. DUS is a supporting state agency that was restructured in 2000 out of the Presidential Directory of Affairs. Primarily the agency is designated for the President and its administration, while also provides support for the Cabinet of Ministers, parliament, and other state agencies if budget permits.

For the President's use, the library prepares documents and analytical materials.
Family.
The president's spouse is recognized as the First Lady, much in the similar fashion as in other countries, although such a title holds no official and legal responsibility and is often undisclosed. However, during the Yushchenko Presidency, his marriage to Kateryna Yushchenko and their private life drew a lot of attention from the media. Apart from Kateryna Yushchenko, little else is known about the other presidential spouses,
The tradition of the Ukrainian "First family" was established by Kuchma, who became the in-law to his daughter's husband and politician Viktor Pinchuk. During the current presidency of Viktor Yanukovych, the "first family" meaning was taken to the next level whose son Viktor became a parliamentarian of Verkhovna Rada with the same political party affiliation.
Impeachment and succession.
In order to impeach the President, they must be convicted of treason to the state and other crimes. A two-thirds constitutional majority in the Verkhovna Rada (300 ayes) must support a procedure of impeachment for it to begin.

To adopt an impeachment resolution, a minimum two-thirds of the parliament must support the impeachment procedure. To remove the President from office, a minimum three-quarters of parliament must support the resolution. The Constitutional and the Supreme Court of Ukraine's conclusions and decisions are considered at the parliamentary meetings. No President has been impeached from office to date.

The acting president is not given the authority to address the nation and parliament, dismiss the legislative branch and appoint candidates for parliamentary approval of government and judicial posts. The acting president cannot call for a referendum, grant military ranks and state orders and exercise their right of pardon. There are no constitutional provisions for presidential succession in case both the president and chairman's posts are vacant.
Ukrainian presidential election, 2004.
The Ukrainian presidential election, 2004 was conducted in late 2004 and was contested between then-Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and former Prime Minister and opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko. The final stages of the election were conducted amidst allegations of media bias, voter intimidation and the poisoning of Viktor Yushchenko that was later confirmed to be the result of the poison dioxins.
The first round of voting was held on October 31, 2004 and finished at a near-draw: official figures gave Yanukovych 39.32% and Yushchenko 39.87% of the votes cast. As no candidate reached the 50 percent constitutional margin required for outright victory, a runoff election was scheduled on November 21. Although a 75 percent voter turnout was recorded in the initial vote, observers reported many irregularities, particularly in the regions where Yushchenko's support was seen to be strongest.
According to the official Central Election Commission results announced on November 23, the run-off election was won by Yanukovych with 49.46 percent of the vote to Yushchenko's 46.61 percent, but Yushchenko and his supporters, as well as many international observers, denounced the election as rigged and highly falsified. Their denouncement and subsequent non-recognition of the vote led to a political crisis where widespread peaceful protests, dubbed the "Orange Revolution," eventually led to the Ukrainian Supreme Court annulling the run-off vote's results and ordering a repeat of the second round.
The repeat vote was conducted on December 26. Observers reported a much fairer vote; Viktor Yushchenko won the Presidency with 51.99 percent of the vote, to Yanukovych's 44.2 percent. Yushchenko was eventually declared the winner on January 10, 2005 after the failure of a legal action brought by Yanukovych. Viktor Yushcenko was sworn in as the third President of Ukraine on January 23, 2005.

It arises in the northwest corner of the basin in the Porcupine Hills and flows generally south, contained in a large valley two miles (3 km) wide and deep, until it nears Pelly, Saskatchewan. Here it turns northeast, collecting tributary streams off the north escarpment of the Duck Mountains, and terminates at Swan Lake. Slopes on the south escarpment of the Porcupine Hills average . The elevation of the Swan River plain at Norquay, Saskatchewan is above sea level, and at Swan Lake it is 850 feet (260 m) above sea level, with an average slope of .
The Swan River has a drainage area of , a maximum annual discharge of (1922), and a maximum daily discharge of (1995). Major tributaries include Maloneck Creek and Spruce Creek, (which originate in the Swan River plain), and Bear Head Creek, Roaring River, the West and East Favel Rivers, and the Sinclair River, (which originate in the Duck Mountains).
Communities located on the river include Swan River and Lenswood. Communities located on its tributaries include Norquay (on Spruce Creek), and Minitonas (on the East Favel River). The average annual discharge of the river at the Town of Swan River is approximately of water.
Surface water quality is generally good to fair. In recent years, total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentration data have shown a decreasing trend.

Napkin folding problem

The napkin folding problem is a problem in geometry and the mathematics of paper folding that explores whether folding a square or a rectangular napkin can increase its perimeter. The problem is known under several names, including the Margulis napkin problem, suggesting it is due to Grigory Margulis, and the Arnold's rouble problem referring to Vladimir Arnold and the folding of a Russian ruble. Some versions of the problem were solved by Robert J. Lang, Svetlana Krat, Alexey S. Tarasov, and Ivan Yaschenko. One form of the problem remains open.
Formulations.
There are several way to define the notion of folding, giving different interpretations. By convention, the napkin is always a unit square.
Folding along a straight line.
One can consider sequential folding of all layers along a line. 
In this case it can be shown that the perimeter is always non-increasing under such foldings, thus never exceeding 4.
It is still unknown if there is a solution using a sequence of foldings, such that each is a reflection of a connected component of folded napkin on one side of a straight line. That is whether a solution can be folded using some combination of mountain folds, valley folds, reverse folds, and/or sink folds (with all folds in the latter two cases being formed along a single line). Also unknown, of course, is whether such a fold would be possible using the more-restrictive pureland origami.
Where only the result matters.
One can ask whether there exists a folded planar napkin (without regard as to how it was folded into that shape). 
Robert J. Lang showed in 1997 that several classical origami constructions give rise to an easy solution. 
In fact, Lang showed that the perimeter can be made as large as desired by making the construction more complicated, while still resulting in a flat folded solution. 
However his constructions are not necessarily rigid origami because of their use of sink folds and related forms. Although no stretching is needed in sink and unsink folds, it is often (though not always) necessary to curve facets and/or sweep one or more creases continuously through the paper in intermediate steps before obtaining a flat result. Whether a general rigidly foldable solution exists based on sink folds is an open problem.
In 1998, I. Yaschenko constructed a 3D folding with projection onto a plane which has a bigger perimeter. This indicated to mathematicians that there was probably a flat folded solution to the problem.
The same conclusion was made by Svetlana Krat.
Her approach is different, she gives very simple construction of a "rumpling" which increase perimeter and then proves that any "rumpling" can be arbitrary well approximated by a "folding". In essence she shows that the precise details of the how to do the folds don't matter much if stretching is allowed in intermediate steps.
Folding without stretching.
One can ask for a realizable construction within the constraints of rigid origami where the napkin is never stretched whilst being folded. In 2004 A. Tarasov showed that that such constructions can indeed be obtained. This can be considered a complete solution to the original problem.
Solutions.
Lang's solutions.
Lang devised two different solutions. Both involved sinking flaps and so were not necessarily rigidly foldable. The simplest was based on the origami bird base and gave a solution with a perimeter of about 4.12 compared to the original perimeter of 4.
The second solution can be used to make a figure with a perimeter as large as desired. He divides the square into a large number of smaller squares and employs the 'sea urchin' type origami construction described in his 1990 book, "Origami Sea Life". The crease pattern shown is the "n" = 5 case and can be used to produce a flat figure with 25 flaps, one for each of the large circles, and sinking is used to thin them. When very thin the 25 arms will give a 25 pointed star with a small center and a perimeter approaching "N"2/("N" − 1). In the case of "N" = 5 this is about 6.25, and the total length goes up approximately as "N".
History.
Arnold states in his book that he formulated the problem in 1956, but the formulation was left intentionally vague. He called it 'the rumpled rouble problem', and it was the first of many interesting problems he set at seminars in Moscow over 40 years. In the West, it became known as Margulis napkin problem after Jim Propp's newsgroup posting in 1996. Despite attention, it received folklore status and its origin is often referred as "unknown".

Afrighids

The Afrighids (from 305 to 995 AD) () were a native Chorasmian Iranian dynasty who ruled over the ancient kingdom of Chorasmia until 995 AD. Over time, they were under the suzerainty of the Sassanid Empire, the Hephthalite Empire, the Göktürk Khaganate, the Umayyad Caliphate and the Samanid Dynasty.
Sources.
Abu Rayhan Biruni, the native Chorasmian scholar, mentions twenty-two members of the Afrighid dynasty for a total span of 690 years with an average rule of 31 years for each ruler. According to him, the Afrighids ruled from 305 AD, through the Arab conquests under Qotayba b. Moslem in 93/712, and up to their overthrow in 385/995 by the rising rival family of Ma'munids. The main source on the Afrighids prior to Islam is also Abu Rayhan Biruni. Part of the reason for the gap in information about this dynasty is mentioned by Biruni.
Biruni states:
Etymology.
It has been suggested that 'Afrigh' is the Arabicized of 'Abriz' in Persian (آبریز where water flows, a reference to the geography of Khwarazm and its abundant water). However, Dr. Parviz Azkai, in his annotations on Biruni's "Chornology of Ancient Nations", explains that this is a popular etymology. Azkai explains that Afrigh was originally Ap-Air-ig meaning "from the Aryan descent": "ap" or "af" is the same in 'afrashtan' (Persian: افراشتن) to raise; "air" is the root meaning Aryan as seen in Iraj, and Eran/Iran (land of Aryan); and "-ig" is the suffix of relation in Iranian languages and cognate to '-ic' in English or '-ique' in French.
Kingdom.
The ancient Iranian kingdom of Khwarazm had been ruled until 995 by the old established line of Afrighids of Kath. Khwarazm, or the classical Chorasmia, was the well irrigated and rich agricultural region of lower Oxus. Surrounded by all sides by steppe land and desert, it was geographically isolated from other areas of civilization. This isolation allowed it to maintain a separate distinctive Iranian language and culture
. Khwarazm was one of the early areas of Iranians civilization, and the local Chorasmian historian, Abu Rayhan Biruni traces civilization there beyond the first millennium BC. Before the 8th century, there had only been few ineffectual Arab raids on the fringes of Chorasmia from the directions of Khorasan and Transoxania. But in 712 AD, Qutayba ibn Muslim was able to intervene in a civil war between the Afrighid Shah and his brother Khorrazad. Two Arab invasions lead to much destruction as Biruni notes. Once the Arabs withdrew from their raid, the Shahs recovered power in Chorasmia and they continued to adhere to their ancestral faith, which according to Biruni was Zoroastrianism. The local shahs continued to ally with local Iranians princes, Soghdian merchances and even Turks and Chinese in order to resist the Arabs.
It thus came vaguely under Muslim suzerainty, but it was not until the end of the 8th century or the beginning of the 9th century that that an Afrighid was first converted to Islam appearing with the popular convert’s name of ‘Abdallah (slave of God). In the course of the 10th century, the local family of the Ma'munids who were based in Gurganj, on the left bank of the Oxus grew in economic and political importance due to trade caravans. In 995, they violently overthrew the Afrighids of Kath and themselves assumed the traditional title of the Khwarazm Shah. Briefly, the area was under Samanid suzerainty, before it passed to Mahmud of Ghazna. From then on, Turco-Mongolian invasions and long rule by Turco-Mongol dynasties supplanted the Iranian character of the region although the title of Khwarizm Shah was maintained well up to the 15th century.
Name of Rulers.
Only consonants of the pre-Islamic names are known with long vowels, since in Arabic script, the short vowels are not written and diacritic signs are used to clarify when required. After the conversion of 'Abdallah, all the names expect possibly 'Eraq are Arabic and their pronunciation is known. Unfortunately, the manuscripts that have also come down have also suffered some corruption due to scribal errors, since the Chorasmian names were incomprehensible for most non-natives. Biruni himself utilizes the extra letters of Chorasmian which were not used in Arabic writings.
More is known about the dynasty in the Islamic era after the beginning of the 8th century and their conversion to Islam.

USCGC McCulloch (WAVP-386)

USCGC "McCullough" (WAVP-386), later WHEC-386, was a "Casco"-class United States Coast Guard Cutter in service from 1946 to 1972. She was the fourth ship of the United States Revenue Cutter Service or United States Coast Guard to bear the name.
Construction and U.S. Navy service.
"McCulloch" began life as the United States Navy motor torpedo boat tender USS "Wachapreague" (AGP-8). She was laid down on 1 February 1943 by Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, Washington, as the "Barnegat"-class seaplane tender USS "Wachapreague" (AVP-56), but selected for conversion to a motor torpedo boat tender on 2 February 1943. She was launched on 10 July 1943 and commissioned into the U.S. Navy on 17 May 1944. During World War II she served in the New Guinea campaign, the Philippines campaign, and the campaign in Borneo, and performed postwar service in Borneo. She was decommissioned on 10 May 1946 at Boston, Massachusetts.
Transferred to the United States Coast Guard.
"Barnegat"-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the United States Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean-station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed.
The Navy transferred "Wachapreague" to the Coast Guard on 27 May 1946 and struck her from the Navy List on 5 June 1946. After she underwent conversion for service as a weather reporting ship, the Coast Guard commissioned her as USCGC "McCulloch" (WAVP-386) on 25 November 1946.
U.S. Coast Guard service.
North Atlantic service 1946-1972.
"McCulloch"s first home port was Boston, Massachusetts, where she would remain stationed until July 1966. Her primary duty was to serve on ocean stations in the Atlantic Ocean to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and-rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and engaged in law enforcement operations.
While "McCullough" was patrolling Ocean Station Bravo off the coast of Labrador, Canada, in January 1959, raging winter seas cracked her main decks and swept one crewman overboard. In spite of that harrowing experience, she managed to reach Naval Station Argentia in Newfoundland, Canada, without further mishap.
During October and November 1965, "McCulloch" was assigned to patrol the Florida Strait and rescue Cuban refugees during the Cuban Exodus, in which thousands of Cubans chanced the rough, hazardous passage from Camarioca, Cuba, to Key West, Florida, many in overcrowded and unseaworthy craft handled by totally inexperienced persons. During this patrol, "McCulloch" was under the command of Commander Frank Barnett, USCG, who was in tactical command of 12 Coast Guard cutters and four airplanes assigned to the Cuban Patrol. In early November 1965, "McCullough" rescued 280 Cuban refugees from small craft in the Florida Strait and carried them to Key West. The crew was cited for outstanding service during this patrol and, on 22 April 1966, "McCulloch" was awarded a Unit Commendation for her Florida Strait patrol, with ceremonies held at Boston, entitling her crew of 144 to wear the Unit Commendation Bar. 
On 1 May 1966, "McCulloch" was reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-386. In July 1966, she was stationed in Wilmington, North Carolina, which would remain her home port until 21 June 1972. Just as during her years at Boston, she spent her years at Wilmington in ocean station, law-enforcement, and search-and-rescue operations.
On 17 June 1970, "McCulloch" helped fight a fire aboard the merchant ship "Tsui Yung" in Wilmington.
Dcommissioning and transfer to South Vietnam.
In April 1972, "McCulloch" and two of her sister ships, Coast Guard cutters USCGC "Absecon" (WHEC-374) and USCGC "Chincoteague" (WHEC-375), were deployed as Coast Guard Squadron Two, with crews composed mainly of members of the United States Coast Guard Reserve. They were originally scheduled to sail to Subic Bay in the Philippine Islands, but were diverted to the U.S. Navy base at Apra Harbor, Guam. Eventually the three cutters were decommissioned, transferred to the U.S. Navy, and then transferred to South Vietnam, all three of these events happening for "McCulloch" on 21 June 1972.
Foreign service.
Republic of Vietnam Navy service.
In South Vietnam, "McCulloch" was commissioned into the Republic of Vietnam Navy as patrol vessel RVNS "Ngo Quyen" (HQ-17).
When South Vietnam collapsed at the end of the Vietnam War in April 1975, "Ngo Quyen" fled to the Philippines. On 22 May 1975 and 23 May 1975, a U.S. Coast Guard team inspected "Ngo Quyen" and several other former "Casco"-class cutters which had been transferred to South Vietnam in 1971 and 1972 and, like "Ngo Quyen", fled to the Philippines in April 1975. One of the inspectors noted: "These vessels brought in several hundred refugees and are generally rat-infested. They are in a filthy, deplorable condition. Below decks generally would compare with a garbage scow."
Philippine Navy service.
After "Ngo Quyen" was cleaned, repaired, and made ready to return to service, the U.S. Navy transferred her to the Republic of the Philippines on 5 April 1976. The Philippine Navy commissioned her as the patrol vessel BRP "Gregorio del Pilar" (PF-8) on 7 February 1977. She served until either May 1985 or April 1990, when she was decommissioned and probably scrapped.

SF Net

SF NET Coffee House Network was an electronic bulletin board system created by Wayne Gregori in San Francisco, California in July 1991.
The network consisted of coin operated, public access computers installed in many Bay Area coffee houses. SF Net allowed individuals from all walks of life to communicate with each other via chat rooms and message boards. Additionally, it provided games and access to FidoNet.
The coffee shop terminals were the culmination of a series of clever solutions to the problems of long-term remote placement in areas marked by low supervision and a young crowd. According to the then-popular Boardwatch magazine, the inexpensive, hence replaceable PC XT sat inside a locked plywood cabinet with vandalism-resistant Zolatone paint and "keyboard condoms," or spill-resistant rubber coverings. Wayne Gregori hired David Lahti, the developer and operator of a popular San Francisco BBS, to develop and maintain the code base for the cafe table's communications software named, TableTalk, the BBS code base was maintained by Gregori. Lahti and Gregori developed and introduced a handshake between the coffee shop terminals and the BBS to distinguish them from other callers, ensuring paying customers could continue to use dedicated lines.

Kreisliga Bayern

The Kreisliga Bayern (English: "District league Bavaria") was the highest association football league in the German Kingdom of Bavaria and, later, the state of Bavaria from 1909 to 1923. The league was disbanded with the introduction of the Bezirksliga Bayern in 1923.
Overview.
1907 to 1914.
The league was formed in a move to improve the organisation of football in Southern Germany in the early 1900s. Within the structure of the Southern German football championship, four regional leagues were gradually established from 1907, these being:
In 1909, a first "Ostkreis-Liga" (English: "Eastern District League") was established, consisting of only four clubs and playing a home-and-away season, these clubs being:
The winner of this competition, Bayern Munich, advanced to the Southern German championship, which in turn was a qualifying competition for the German championship. The Bavarian clubs from the Palatinate never played in the same league as the clubs from the "mainland", instead, they were part of the "Westkreis-Liga". Previous to the new "Ostkreis-Liga", regional competitions with a finals round were played but this was not truly an all-Bavarian competition as only clubs from the mayor citys took part.
The following season, 1910-11, a proper league with ten clubs was established, the teams again playing a home-and-away season. Parallel, the other three Southern "Kreisligas" were organised in a similar fashion with the four regional winners playing for the southern title. In the following season, the league was expanded to eleven teams but the modus remained the same.
For the 1912-13 season, the league was reduced to eight teams. It remained unchanged for its last pre-First World War season in 1913-14.
1914 to 1919.
The outbreak of war in August 1914 lead to a suspension of all football competitions. Initially it was thought that the war would not last long but when it became evident that this was not so, competitions were restarted with players too young or too old to be drafted to the military. In any case, a 1914-15 championship was not held. A 1915-16 championship was held on regional level with a Bavarian final rather than a league, a system in place for 1916-17 and 1917-18 as well.
1919 to 1923.
With the collapse of the German Empire in 1918, no Bavarian championship was played in 1918-19 but football returned to a more organised system in 1919, similar to the one used before the war.
Southern Germany, now without the Alsace region, which had to be returned to France, was sub-divided into ten "Kreisligas", these being:
Bavaria was sub-divided into two "Kreisligas", north and south, with ten clubs each. Both league winners advanced to the Southern championship. This system applied for the 1919-20 and 1920-21 season. 
In 1921-22, the two regional divisions were in turn split into two groups of eight, increasing the number of tier-one clubs in Bavaria to 32. The four league winners then played a semi-final and final to determined the Bavarian champion. This "watering down" of Bavarian football lasted for only one season, in 1922-23, the number of top clubs was halved and the league returned to a northern and southern division, now with eight clubs each. The two league winners played a Bavarian final once more.
In 1923, a league reform which was decided upon in Darmstadt, Hesse, established the Southern German "Bezirksligas" which were to replace the "Kreisligas". The best four teams each from the north and south of Bavaria were admitted to the new "Bezirksliga Bayern".

Yang Hilang is the greatest hits compilation album by Indonesian singer Anggun. It was released in 1994 by her own record company, "Bali Cipta Record".
History.
"Yang Hilang" became Anggun's last album in Indonesia before she embarked onto her international career. The album featured her hit-singles from her past Indonesian studio albums since 1990 to 1993 with 2 new songs "Yang Hilang" and "Masa Masa Remaja". Although it was a greatest hit compilation album, "Yang Hilang" contained not all of her famous works, such as "Takut", "Bayang Bayang Ilusi", "Kembalilah Kasih" and even none track of her first album "Dunia Aku Punya" (1986).
The song "Yang Hilang" was Anggun's final rock single in Indonesia and became another hit for Anggun. Same as the album title, "Yang Hilang" (The Lost One), after the released of album, Anggun disappeared from Indonesian music scene and moved to Europe in recent year.

The J&S Hunter Coupe was a fibreglass kit car made in the 1960s by J&S Fibreglass, a small company that specialised in making various removable hard tops and other kit cars including the J&S Beach Buggy, their most successful model. The company was located in Five Dock, New South Wales. It ceased to trade some years ago.
Approximately 20 body shells and chassis units were made. The last was recorded in 1968.
Various motors and components were fitted to the cars. The most common version was fitted with Holden "grey" motors and chassis components. Other known variants include two cars fitted with Jaguar 3.4 litre engines coupled with some Studebaker suspension components, another was fitted with a Ford Zephyr V6 engine.
Several cars were raced. The most famous was built by Ian & Jill Hindmarsh of Kiama, New South Wales. Hindmarsh was a skilled motor mechanic and the car that he built up was presented exceptionally well. As a result the car featured in all of the J&S promotional materials and brochures. The Hindmarsh Hunter was raced in various club events and was quite successful from 1962 to 1966. In Easter 1965 the car was raced at Mount Panorama Circuit New South Wales recording a maximum speed of 125 mph on Conrod Straight. In mid 1965 the Hindmarsh Hunter was fitted with a new Holden 179 engine and raced at Warwick Farm race circuit.

First Nebraska Territorial Legislature

The First Nebraska Territorial Legislature first met in Omaha, Nebraska on January 15, 1855. The Council Bluffs and Nebraska Ferry Company provided the first meeting place, which was a building "constructed for public purposes." Standing out from the estimated twenty shacks in the young town, it was the first brick building in Omaha, which was founded the year before when the Nebraska Territory was created. Responsible for several important decisions that laid an important foundation for future statehood for Nebraska, the Nebraska Territorial Legislature made controversial votes and provided significant leadership for the fledgling territory.
Issues.
The first legislature, along with several subsequent gatherings, drew criticism for a perceived lack of representation of the population south of the Platte River. Legislators from south of the Platte wore red blankets over their shoulders in the first session to indicate their hostility towards the northern legislators.
Although the then current Omaha capitol building, built in 1857-58, was apparently sturdy enough to house legislative sessions for several years and was well located in relation to Nebraska's 1867 population, it was still north of the Platte. Forces from the south launched a major verbal and legal initiative to move the seat of government to their part of the state. The first Legislature was also responsible for chartering Nebraska University in Washington County. Slavery in Nebraska was a topic of the first legislature, where members were largely influenced by events in neighboring Kansas. The first legislature considered an exclusion measure designed to keep former slaves from the territory. After the bill was postponed the issue continued to be raised, ultimately delaying statehood.
Members.
Few of the members had actually spent more than a night in the districts they represented, and most ferried to Council Bluffs, Iowa at the end of each day for rest. The new territorial governor, Mark W. Izard, was successful at persuading members to adopt Iowa's legislative rules. Omaha members bribed other legislators to keep the capitol in Omaha by offering them lots in their new city. This land, which now wraps around the north and west ends of Downtown Omaha, was called Scriptown.
Although not a member, Reverend W.D. Gage served as the chaplain, and later the legislature returned the favor by naming Gage County after him.

Dick Kempthorn

Richard James "Dick" Kempthorn (born October 23, 1926) is a former collegiate athlete, Air Force pilot, and businessman from Canton, Ohio, USA. He played college football on the undefeated National Champion 1947 and 1948 Michigan Wolverines football teams and was the Most Valuable Player on the 1949 team. He later served as a jet fighter pilot in the Korean War where he received the Distinguished Flying Cross. He turned down an opportunity to play professional football to join his father in the automobile business. Over the next 50 years, Kempthorn built a series of automobile dealerships in Canton, Ohio.
Youth.
Kempthorn is a native of Canton, Ohio. He played high school football for Canton McKinley High School. Kempthorn was a starter at quarterback and linebacker in high school, and in two years of varsity football, his teams went 16-2-2 and won a state championship.
College football.
Miami University and the Merchant Marine.
After graduating from high school, he was admitted to the United States Merchant Marine Academy in San Mateo, California. Before starting at the Academy, Kempthorn attended the Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he played in six football games for the Redskins under Coach Sid Gillman.
After several weeks of training at the Merchant Marine Academy, Kempthorn was assigned to serve as an engine cadet on the crew of the cargo ship, USS Wild Hunter, which participated in the invasion of the Philippines.
Transfer to Michigan.
After the end of World War II, Kempthorn visited Michigan and decided to transfer to Michigan rather than returning to complete his studies at the Merchant Marine Academy. Unable to play in 1946 due to the transfer rule, Kempthorn played with Coach Wally Weber's team of reserve players and ineligibles. When Kempthorn laid out two varsity players in a scrimmage, Coach Fritz Crisler reportedly told Weber to "get that wild man out of there." Weber said, "He's the roughest young man we've had around here since the late Bill Hewitt. He's strewn the landscape with football humanity."
Kempthorn first played with the Wolverines during 1947 spring practice. At that time, Kempthorn impressed Michigan's coaches with his drive on offense and hard tackling on defense; he was described as "rugged and beautifully proportioned but green and crude." Even before he played a regular season game, Kempthorn was tagged as "one of the finest fullbacks ever to enrol at Michigan."
1947 season.
Kempthorn joined a 1947 Michigan football team that was loaded with talent returning from the war. The team went undefeated in the regular season, beat USC 49-0 in the 1948 Rose Bowl game, outscored its opponents 394-53 and was selected by the ESPN Big Ten College Football Encyclopedia as the best team in the history of Michigan football. The 1947 team is also remembered as the first team fully to embrace the concept of defensive and offensive specialization. Previously, most players had played their positions on both offense and defense. But in 1947, Coach Fritz Crisler established separate offensive and defensive squads.
At the outset of the season, Kempthorn won the starting job at fullback. Kempthorn scored a touchdown on his second carry in the 1947 season opener, a 55-0 win against Michigan State. In only his third game for Michigan, against Pittsburgh, Kempthorn sustained a knee injury. Kempthorn missed three games due to the knee injury and returned to star on defense against Indiana. Kempthorn was back on the injury list after the Indiana game and later recalled that, after the knee injury, he was unable to execute the spinning movement required of a back in the single wing offense.
In the 1948 Rose Bowl, USC penetrated deep into Michigan's territory only once, and Kempthorn ended that drive with an interception on the 11-yard line.
1948 season.
After missing the opening game of the 1948 season with a pulled muscle, Kempthorn did not see much action on offense but won respect for his play at linebacker with the defensive unit. In the second game of the season, Kempthorn stood out on defense, leading a defensive stand in which the Wolverines stopped the Oregon on four straight plays from inside the five-yard line. The United Press called linebackers Kempthorn and Dan Dworsky the "defensive mainstays" of a defense that gave up only 44 points in the 1948 season. The 1948 team finished 8-0 and was ranked No. 1 in the final Associated Press poll.
1949 season.
During his senior season in 1949, Kempthorn was used chiefly as a linebacker on the defensive squad, although he also saw considerable offensive duty as a fullback. After a victory of Minnesota, the Associated Press published a profile of Kempthorn describing him as follows:"Dick Kempthorn, Michigan's touch blond fullback, is good at both offense and defense. That's on the record book and none can dispute it. But he'll go down in the fan's book as a line backer deluxe, a role he played with magnificent effect as Michigan went unbeaten in 1947-48. ... His vicious tackling was the keynote of the inspired Michigan line that made a shambles of a Minnesota team that was rated one of the best in years."
After the 1949 season, the Michigan players voted to award the Most Valuable Player award to Kempthorn.
The 1950 Michiganensian Yearbook said of Kempthorn:"Dick Kempthorn - Destined to go down in football history as one of the finest line backers ever to come from the Mid-West, Dick Kempthorn wound up his grid career with a resounding pat on the back from his teammates who voted him the well-deserved honor of 'Most Valuable Player.' Seeing only limited offensive action 'the Killer' was generally overlooked by All-American selectors, an omission disputed by those who had witnessed explosive Kempthorn tackles on play after play of every Wolverine contest."
Kempthorn was selected to play on three College All-Star teams while playing at Michigan from 1947-1949.
Kempthorn's gloves in the 1950 "Snow Bowl".
Kempthorn stayed on briefly to help Bennie Oosterbaan as an assistant backfield coach in 1950. That fall, his pigskin gloves played a key role in the infamous "Snow Bowl" victory over Ohio State. The game was played in a blizzard that shut down both offenses, and the punting game became the key. Michigan won the game, 9-3, despite never getting a first down. The teams punted 45 times, sometimes on first down. The strategy was based on the weather in that both teams felt it better to have the ball in the hands of their opponents near the end zone and hope for a fumble of the slippery ball. In the end, Michigan won with a touchdown scored after blocking a punt.
Chuck Ortmann was Michigan's punter, and his fingers were becoming numb in the freezing weather. Kempthorn had purchased a new pair of pigskin gloves for the Ohio trip and gave them to Ortmann early in the game when Ortmann complained that his hands were getting numb. Ortmann later joked that they "were not masculine gloves but dainty tight fitting little numbers." But the gloves gave Ortmann a perfect grip on the ball. Ortmann noted that even though the gloves became soaked, "the wet ball stuck to them like glue." It was Ortmann's error-free punting that won the game for the Wolverines. Kempthorn's gloves, described in may articles as formal "junior prom" gloves, were credited with having won Michigan the game and a trip to the Rose Bowl.
Later years.
Rejection of professional football.
Kempthorn was the 123rd pick in the 1948 NFL Draft (by the Philadelphia Eagles) and the second round pick of the Cleveland Browns in the 1949 AAFC Secret Draft. However, Kempthorn bypassed professional football and instead opted to return to Canton, Ohio to join his father's Dodge-Plymouth automobile dealership. One sports columnist wrote the following about Kempthorn's decision:"Dick Kempthorn, Michigan's great linebacker who could name his own price in pro football, says he wants no part of pro ball. He'll work for his father, who is in the automotive business in Canton, Ohio, after graduation. Draft rights for Kempthorn, rated the deadliest tackler Michigan has produced in almost three decades, are held by the Cleveland Browns and Philadelphia Eagles."
Heroism in the Korean War.
When the Korean War broke out, Kempthorn joined the United States Air Force and spent three years as a pilot. He flew more than 100 missions as a jet fighter pilot and received the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery. In March 1953, Kempthorn was recognized for heroism after he rescued fellow pilot, Henry Rock, from a burning fighter plane in Japan. After Rock's plane crashed on the runway, Kempthorn sprinted 200 yards to the crash scene, jumped on the wing and ripped loose the bullet-proof glass canopy. With Rock trapped by the gunsight as flames burned Rock's face and hands, Kempthorn took the gunsight in his bare hands and broke off the mounting. Shortly after Rock was freed, the plane exploded.
In June 1947, three months after Kempthorn was cited for bravery, the 1947 team held a five-year reunion. Kempthorn's former teammates and Coach Crisler all signed a football and sent it to him in Korea. Newspapers covered the long-distance gift, and one reporter wrote:"Lt. Richard Kempthorn, jet fighter pilot with the army airforce in Korea, doesn't know it yet but he's about to receive a present that he'll undoubtedly cherish the rest of his life. Mighty Dick, one of the great linebackers in football history, was one of the line-wrecking crew of Michigan's championship 1947-48 teams, and now he's doing an even finer job as a fighter pilot with more than 60 missions behind him in Korea."
Kempthorn Automall in Canton.
In 1953, Kempthorn returned to Canton, Ohio where he returned to work in his father's car dealership. Cleveland Browns Coach Paul Brown tried to persuade Kempthorn to play professional football, but Kempthorn decided to work for his father. Kempthorn bought the business from his father in 1964 and expanded it from a Dodge-Plymouth dealership into a business called "Dick Kempthorn Car Sales" selling multiple brands of automobiles and trucks. As of 2004, the 77-year-old Kempthorn was still working at the car dealership with his three children. The business has now expanded into the Kempthorn Auto Mall in Canton, which includes Kempthorn-owned dealerships for Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Mazda, Volkswagen, and Jaguar.
University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor.
In 1992, Kempthorn was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor.

<doc id="20688783" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20688783" title="Conversion of Pomerania">
Conversion of Pomerania

Medieval Pomerania was converted from Slavic paganism to Christianity by Otto von Bamberg in 1124 and 1128 (Duchy of Pomerania), and in 1168 by Absalon (Principality of Rügen). 
Earlier attempts, undertaken since the 10th century, failed or were short-lived. The new religion stabilized when the Pomeranian dukes founded several monasteries and called in Christian, primarily German settlers during the Ostsiedlung. The first Pomeranian abbey was founded in 1153 at the site where the first Christian duke of Pomerania, Wartislaw I, was slain by a pagan. The Duchy of Pomerania was organized by the Roman Catholic Church in the Bishopric of Cammin in 1140. Pomeranian areas not belonging to the duchy at this time were attached to the dioceses of Włocławek (East), Roskilde (Rügen) and Schwerin (West).
The name "Pomerania" comes from Slavic po more, which means Land at the Sea. 
Bishopric of Havelberg (948-983).
When the Bishopric of Havelberg was founded in 948, the constitution document mentions the area between Peene and Oder among the bishopric's belongings. In 983, the Holy Roman Empire lost control over the region due to a Slavic uprising.
Diocese of Kolobrzeg (Kolberg, 1000 - 1005).
The first Polish duke Mieszko I invaded Pomerania and subdued the gard of Kołobrzeg (Kolberg) and the adjacent areas in the 960s. He also fought the Wolinians, but despite a won battle in 967, he did not succeed in the town of Wolin itself. His son and successor Boleslaw I continued to campaign in Pomerania, but also failed to subdue the Wolinians and the lower Oder areas.
During the Congress of Gniezno in 1000 AD, Boleslaw created the first, yet short-lived bishopric in Pomerania Diocese of Kołobrzeg, subordinate to the Archdiocese of Gniezno, headed by Saxon bishop Reinbern, which was destroyed when Pomeranians revolted in 1005. Of all Lutici, the Wolinians were especially devoted to participation in the wars between the Holy Roman Empire and Poland from 1002 to 1018 to prevent Boleslaw I from reinstating his rule in Pomerania.
Failed mission of Günther (1017).
In 1017, a priest called Günther tried to convert the inhabitants of Vorpommern; the mission was not successful.
Failed mission of Bernard (1122).
Another attempt was made following the subjugation of Pomerania by Boleslaw III of Poland. In 1122, Spanish monk Bernard (also Bernhard) travelled to Jumne (Wolin), accompanied only by his chaplain and an interpreter. The Pomeranians however were not impressed by his missionary efforts and finally threw him out of town.
Bernard was later made bishop of Lebus.
Otto of Bamberg (1124/28).
After Bernard's failure, Boleslaw III asked Otto of Bamberg to convert Pomerania to Christianity, which he accomplished in his first visit in 1124/25. Otto's strategy severely differed from the one Bernard used: While Bernard travelled alone and as a poor and unknown priest, Otto, a wealthy and famous man, was accompagnied by 20 clergy of his own diocese, numerous servants, 60 warriors supplied to him by Boleslaw, and carried with him numerous supplies and gifts. Otto arrived in Pyritz, and the fact that he was already wealthy assured the Pomeranians that his aim was only to convert them to Christianity, not to become wealthy at the expense of the Pomeranian people. He persuaded the Pomeranians that their conversion would protect them from further punishment by God, which was how the devastating Polish conquest was depicted. This approach turned out to be successful, and was backed by parts of the Pomeranian nobility who had already been raised as Christians, like Duke Wartislaw I, who encouraged and promoted Otto's mission. Many Pomeranians had already been baptized in Pyritz and also in the other burghs Otto visited.
Otto of Bamberg returned on 19 April 1128, this time invited by duke Wartislaw I himself, aided by the emperor Holy Roman Emperor Lothar II, to convert the Slavs of Western Pomerania just incorporated into the Pomeranian duchy, and to strengthen the Christian faith of the inhabitants of Stettin and Wollin, who fell back into heathen practices and idolatry. Otto this time visited primarily Western Pomeranian burghs, had the temples of Gützkow and Wolgast torn down and on their sites erected the predecessors of today's "St Nikolai" and "St Petri" churches, respectively. The nobility assembled to a congress in Usedom, where they accepted Christianity on June 10, 1128. Otto then was titled "apostolus gentis Pomeranorum", made a saint by pope Clement III in 1189, and was worshipped in Pomerania even after the Protestant Reformation. Otto aborted the mission in November 1128 on behalf of the emperor, after he had sought to mediate the conflicts between the Pomeranian and Polish dukes.
Adalbert of Pomerania, the later Pomeranian bishop, participated in Otto's mission as an interpreter and assistant.
Pomeranian dioceses.
Diocese of Kammin (Cammin, 1140).
On Otto of Bamberg's behalf, a diocese was founded with the see in Wollin ("Julin", "Jumne", "Vineta"), a major Slavic and Viking town in the Oder estituary. On October 14, 1140, Adalbert of Pomerania was made the first Bishop by Pope Innocent II. Otto however had died the year before. There was a rivalry between Otto's Diocese of Bamberg, the Diocese of Magdeburg and the Diocese of Gniezno for the incorporation of Pomerania. Pope Innocence II solved the dispute by repelling their claims and placed the new diocese directly under his Holy See. The see of the diocese was the church of "St Adalbert" in Wollin. The diocese had no clear-cut borders in the beginning, but roughly reached from the Tribsees burgh in the West to the Leba River in the East. In the South, it comprised the northern parts of Uckermark and Neumark. As such, it was shaped after the territory held by Ratibor I, Duke of Pomerania.
After ongoing Danish raids, Wollin was destroyed, and the see of the diocese was shifted across the Dievenow to Cammin's (also "Kammin", now Kamień Pomorskie) "St John's" church in 1176. This was confirmed by the pope in 1186. In the early 13th century, the Cammin diocese along with the Pomeranian dukes gained control over Circipania. Also, the bishops managed to gain direct control over a territory around Kolberg (now Kolobrzeg) and Köslin (now Koszalin).
Dioceses of Włocławek, Roskilde and Schwerin.
Pomeranian areas outside the Duchy of Pomerania were assigned to other dioceses. The Pomerelian areas were integrated into the Kuyavian Diocese of Włocławek. The Rugian areas were integrated into the Diocese of Schwerin (mainland) and the Diocese of Roskilde (islands).
Wendish Crusade (1147).
In 1147, the Wendish Crusade, a campaign of the Northern Crusades, was mounted by bishops and nobles of the Holy Roman Empire. The crusaders pillaged the land and besieged Demmin and Szczecin despite the fact that both towns were (officially) Christian already. Wollin's bishop Adalbert took part in the negotiations that finally led to the lifting of the Szczecin siege by the crusaders. Ratibor I, Duke of Pomerania, went to the assembly of the Imperial Diet in Havelberg the following year, where he swore to be a Christian.
Absalon (1168).
After Otto von Bamberg's mission, only the Rani principality of Rugia (Rügen) remained pagan. This was changed by a Danish expedition of 1168, launched by Valdemar I of Denmark and Absalon, archbishop of Roskilde. The Danish success in this expedition ended a series of conflicts between Denmark and Rügen. The Rügen princes, starting with Jaromar I, became vassals of Denmark, and the principality would be Denmark's bridgehead on the southern shore of the Baltic for the next few centuries. The 1168 expedition was decided when after a Danish siege of the burgh of Arkona, a fire broke out leaving the defendants unable to further withstand the siege. Since Arkona was the major temple of the superior god Swantewit and therefore crucial for the powerful clerics, the Rani surrendered their other strongholds and temples without further fighting. Absalon had the Rani burn the wooden statues of their gods and integrated Rügen into the Diocese of Roskilde. The mainland of the Rügen principality was integrated into the Diocese of Schwerin.
Monasteries.
After the successful conversion of the nobility, monasteries were set up on vast areas granted by local dukes both to further implement Christian faith and to develop the land. The monasteries actively took part in the Ostsiedlung.

Educational institutions.
The following educational institutions are located in Kalletumkara :-
IJLPS school.
This school owned by Infant Jesus Church, Kallettumkara. Previously this was the only school for the surrounding area like Muriyad, Parakattukara, Pulipara etc. for their primary education. Presently, the arrival of new generation English medium schools adversely affect the school as students drain which reduced its total number of divisions from twenty to less than five. Recently the school has started its own English medium section.
BVMHS School.
The BVMHS school was constructed by The Catholic Education Trust, formed by the church parish council on the land which donated by Infant Jesus Church Kallettumkara. Mr P A John was appointed as a first Manager of this school by the trust. The school is managed by The Catholic Education Trust, Kallettumkara. Similar to IJLP School, this was the only school for the surrounding area for upper primary and high school education. The upcoming of English medium schools with high standards and the awareness of parents regarding the importance of English education which resulted severe division loss. The new management has taken some remedical measures like free transportation, financial package for students from lower income group etc. in order to attaract students for avoiding division loss. The management also started English premium in its compound. The management has succeeded in its efforts to a certain level, but it has to improve more. The infrastructure of the school has to improve a lot like good building; computer, chemistry, physics, biology labs; library with current publications, enough toilets and sanitation facilities, proper waste disposal system etc. This is not only can be achieved by the management but also with the help of Education Board of Kerala Govt., as government grants are very less. Contrary to the previous said, the students form BVMHS are serving in various fields of the society like Doctors, Engineers, Nurses, Accountants, Advocates, IT professionals and Skilled Technicians inside and outside India mainly in middle east. This itself states the prominence of the school and pride of the management. Now the members of the Catholic Education Trust turned against church and take decisions without knowledge of church now a case is in high court against church and trust for mishandling the school to private parties by the parisheners

Darling Jiménez (Yonkers, born March 4, 1980) is an American professional boxer of Dominican descent.
Biography.
Jimenez began boxing at the age of 12. He now resides in the Washington Heights section of New York.
Amateur career.
Darling Jimenez compiled an exceptional amateur record of 107-3. He is a four-time New York Golden Gloves Champion (1997-2000) who earned the Sugar Ray Robinson Award for Outstanding Boxer at the Golden Gloves three times (1997-1999). He beat Paul Malignaggi twice in his victories at the New York Golden Gloves Championships. He reached the semi-finals of the 2000 Olympic Trials where he was defeated by David Jackson, the eventual 132 lb. representative for the U.S. Olympic Team.
Professional career.
In his pro debut on September 15, 2000, Jimenez challenged Artur Petrosyan in Petroysan’s Las Vegas, Nevada backyard. Petroysan entered the bout with a record of 5-0. Nevertheless, Jimenez battled Petrosyan from the opening bell, earning a four round draw (D 4).
Since his pro debut Jimenez has rattled off nine consecutive victories, four by knockout.
On February 2, 2002, Jimenez stunned ringside observers with his three round demolition of fellow undefeated jr. lightweight Jadschi Green (TKO 3). Green, who entered the bout with a record of 4-0-2, 4 KO’s, attempted to utilize his five inch reach advantage to box and frustrate Jimenez. Jimenez patiently dismantled Green with punishing left hooks to the body and stinging lead rights, flooring Green once in round two and twice in round three. The referee halted the bout at the :47 mark of round three, immediately following the second knockdown of the round.
On March 15, 2002, Jimenez dominated Ronnie Longakit to pitch a six round shutout by the scores of 60-54 (three times). Jimenez bloodied Longakit’s nose and swelled both his eyes with stinging overhand rights to dominate the bout from the opening bell.

Gamboa started off well in the first three rounds of the fight, swarming Jimenez and hitting him with punches over and over. Gamboa looked flustered in the fourth round and began showing signs of fatigue. In the fourth round, Jimenez caught Gamboa with a right hand behind the ear and knocked Gamboa down. Gamboa won a unanimous decision. Two judges had the fight 92-97, and one had it 99-91.

I Vant to Bite Your Finger is suggested to be played with 2–4 players ages 6 and up.
About.
I Vant to Bite Your Finger allows players to advance around the board. Players call out a number and are required to turn a clock attached to the vampire up to that number of clicks.

Pep Cereal

Pep was a brand of whole-wheat breakfast cereal produced by the Kellogg Company, and introduced in 1923. Pep was a long-running rival to Wheaties, and also the sponsor of Mutual Radio's "The Adventures of Superman" radio series. One of Pep's advertising slogans was "the Sunshine cereal".
Pep became one of the first "fortified" cereals, with an infusion of vitamins, beginning in the 1930s. Extensive advertising, from print advertisements to sponsorship of Superman, helped keep the brand in the public's consciousness. Pep was included in "variety packs" of serving-sized boxes of Kellogg's cereals. Despite its pluses, Pep faded from popularity as public tastes changed, and the brand was discontinued in the late 1970s.
In-package prizes.
In 1945, Kellogg inserted a prize in the form of pinback buttons into each box of Pep cereal. Pep pins have included U.S. Army squadrons as well as characters from newspaper comics. There were five series of comic characters and 18 different buttons in each set, with a total of 90 in the collection. Mint condition Pep pins, as with prizes from many cereal brands, have become sought-after collectables.

Aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks

In the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, there were multiple and far-ranging events that were observed. Besides the immediate impact on the victims and their families, the attacks caused widespread anger among the Indian public, and condemnations from countries throughout the world.
The immediate impact was felt on Mumbai and Maharashtra state, and throughout urban India. There were also after-effects on the Indian government, centre-state relations within India, Indo-Pakistani relations, domestic impact within Pakistan, the United States's relationships with both countries, the US-led NATO war in Afghanistan, and on the Global War on Terror.
There was also impact on the region of Kashmir and this also led to the 2010 Kashmir Unrest.
Immediate impact.
Impact on the attack sites.
The Leopold Cafe opened its doors to customers just four days after the attacks. The owners wanted to repair the damaged parts of the cafe, while retaining some of the damaged pieces as a tribute to those who lost their lives in the attacks.
Security forces handed back control of the Taj Mahal Hotel to the Taj group on 1 December 2008, and work on its repairs began that same day. Celebrated artist M.F. Hussain, whose art was destroyed in the attacks, has agreed to replace the paintings with a series that will condemn the attack. Hussain plans this series as a tribute to the staff of the hotel, who laid down their lives to save other people.
Control of the Trident has already been handed back to the management, while the Oberoi will take 3–4 months to resume operations. Both the Taj and Trident hotels reopened on 21 December 2008.
Nariman House will also reopen soon, but it is not known exactly when. Several young Chabad couples from all over the world have stepped forward to move to Mumbai and continue the movement's work.
Impact on Mumbai.
In the aftermath of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, all schools and colleges, and most offices were closed. The Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange remained closed on 27 November 2008. Shooting of Bollywood films and TV series had also been halted in the city. Many international airlines temporarily discontinued operations to Mumbai, in the interest of passenger and crew safety.
The Indian Cricket League's ongoing tournament in Ahmedabad was cancelled. The two remaining One Day Internationals of the seven match series between the visiting England cricket team and India were cancelled. The visiting team flew home, but returned to continue the test series. However, the venue of the second India-England test match, scheduled on 19–23 December, was shifted from Mumbai to Chennai. The inaugural Twenty20 Champions League, scheduled from 3 to 10 December, Mumbai being one of the host cities, was postponed. The attacks have brought into significance the issue of 379 Indian boats and 336 fishermen apprehended by the Pakistan marine agency, for entering their waters. Nearly 200 of the boats have reportedly been auctioned, now recognised as a national security issue for India. On 28 November, Pakistan released 99 fishermen who were apprehended, as part of confidence building measures with India. There were threats to blow up ITC Fortune Hotel in Navi Mumbai, after Mumbai police received a bomb threat from terrorists. Rumours about further shootings at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus were doing the rounds in Mumbai on 28 November, and were widely reported by the news channels. The Railway Police denied these rumours, but stopped trains approaching CST.
Maharashtra state government.
After seeing the disparity between the quality of helmets and bulletproof vests used by NSG commandos and the police, the Police Commissioner of Pune, Satyapal Singh, said his police officers needed the same quality equipment as used by the NSG to reduce deaths and improve performance.
Maharashtra government has planned to buy 36 speed boats to patrol the coastal areas, and several helicopters for the same purpose. It will also create an Anti-Terror force known as the Force One, and it will upgrade all the weapons that Mumbai Police currently have.
The CST railway station was upgraded with metal detectors, but reports say that these are ineffective because the attendants cannot hear their beeps in the crowd. Civilians have tested these using their own licensed weapons.
Maharashtra's new Home Minister, Jayant Patil, was forced to defend the performance of the police in the legislative assembly, against demands from the opposition parties for resignations from the police chief and other officials.
In an attempt to take forward the 26/11 probe, the Mumbai Police will send a three members team to the United States in this regard, sources said. The team comprising Inspector Bharti, Inspector Kadam and Inspector Arun Chavan will share the findings of the 26 November 2008 Mumbai attacks, with apex US investigative agency FBI. Mumbai police have sent a proposal to the Home Ministry, stating the need to establish direct contact with the FBI, to facilitate investigation in the Mumbai terror attacks. It is believed that the team, if permitted to go, will share the evidence gathered by Mumbai police, which prove Pakistan's hand in the attacks on the nation's integrity.
After-effects.
Government of India.
A Cabinet Committee on Security meeting was held on Tuesday, 2 December, to discuss expanding the National Security Guards (NSG) to cities outside Delhi. The aim is to have permanent presence of NSG anti-terrorist squads in cities such as Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kolkata, to avoid wasting precious time travelling from Delhi.
All NSG commandos will now undergo a new module of training, to learn how to deal with future anti-siege operations, because the Taj terrorists were in a gun battle for 59 hours continuously.
Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, on an all party conference, declared that legal framework will be strengthened in the battle against terrorism and a federal anti-terrorist intelligence and investigation agency, like the FBI, will soon be set up to co-ordinate actions against terrorism. On 17 December, the Lok Sabha approved two new anti-terror bills, which are expected to pass the upper house (Rajya Sabha) on the 19th. One sets up a National Investigation Agency, similar to the FBI, with sweeping powers of investigation. The second strengthens existing anti-terror laws, to allow suspects to be detained without bail for up to six months, on the orders of a judge.
Centre-State relations.
The "National Investigation Agency Bill, 2008", sets up a central agency for investigating terrorism related crimes. However, law and order is a state subject in the Constitution of India, which had made such a law difficult to pass in the past.
Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram assured parliament that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) did not usurp the States' right in any manner. The central government would make use of its power only under "extraordinary" circumstances, and depending on the gravity of the situation, he said. "The agency will also have the powers to return the investigations to the State, if it so thinks. We have struck a balance between the right of the States and duties of the Centre to investigate."
Indo-Pakistani relations.
The attacks have damaged India's already strained relationship with Pakistan. India handed over two demarches to Pakistan—one was submitted at the Foreign Office in Islamabad by Indian High Commissioner Satyabrata Pal. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs also summoned Pakistan High Commissioner Shahid Malik on 1 December 2008, to lodge a formal protest over Pakistan's failure to curb terrorism emanating from its soil. According to the Indian External Affairs Minister, Pranab Mukherjee, India, in the demarches to Pakistan, asked for the arrest and handover of those 20 persons, including gangster Dawood Ibrahim, the founder of Jaish-e-Mohammad, terrorist leader Maulana Masood Azhar and Lashkar-e-Taiba, and chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, who are settled in Pakistan and who are fugitives of Indian law. The external affairs minister has also stated that India will await Pakistan’s response. He has not ruled out the option of military strikes against terrorist camps in Pakistan.
On 28 November, a hoax caller pretending to be the Indian Foreign Minister threatened Pakistan President Zardari with war, leading to the Pakistan military being put in high alert. Military aircraft with live ammunition were scrambled to patrol above Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Apparently, sources claimed, this was Pakistan's attempt to divert the core issue.
Requests for Pakistan's cooperation.
India's claims that the perpetrators were Pakistan-based were consistently denied by Pakistan. Pakistan initially contested this attribution, but agreed this was the case on 7 January 2009. The Indian government supplied a dossier to Pakistan's high commission in Delhi, containing interrogations, weapons, and call records of conversations during the attacks. Shown to friendly governments and media, it provides a detailed sequence of training, supplying, and constant communications with handlers from Pakistan. The Pakistan government dismissed the dossier as "not evidence", but also announced that it had detained over a hundred members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a charity linked with Lashkar-e-Taiba. Moreover, Indian government officials said that the attacks were so sophisticated that they must have had official backing from Pakistani "agencies". an accusation denied by Pakistan.
At the request of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the head of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Ahmad Shuja Pasha, was reported to be coming to India to share intelligence and help the investigation, but later on it was decided by Pakistani authorities that instead of Director General of the ISI, his representative will visit India to help the Indian government in the investigations.
India handed over two demarches to Pakistan – one was submitted at the Foreign Office in Islamabad by Indian High Commissioner Satyabrata Pal. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs also summoned Pakistan High Commissioner Shahid Malik on 1 December 2008, to lodge a formal protest against Pakistan's inaction against terrorist groups operating within the country.
The Indian foreign ministry released a statement, describing the actions it expects Islamabad to take. "It was conveyed to the Pakistan high commissioner that Pakistan's actions needed to match the sentiments expressed by its leadership, that it wishes to have a qualitatively new relationship with India," the statement said. "He was informed that the recent terrorist attack on Mumbai was carried out by elements from Pakistan. Government expects that strong action would be taken against those elements, whosoever they may be, responsible for this outrage," it said.
The CNN-IBN reported that India had asked Pakistan to hand over Mumbai Underworld Don Dawood Ibrahim, Lashkar-e-Toiba chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed and Jaish-e-Mohammed leader Maulana Masood Azhar for their suspected involvement in the Mumbai terror attack.
Dawood, India’s most wanted criminal, is suspected to have helped the LeT terrorists who attacked Mumbai on 26 November. Azhar, founder of the terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad, is on India's most wanted list of people it accuses of terrorism. India freed Azhar from prison in exchange for passengers on a hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814 in 1999.
"Times of India", quoting Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee, reported: "Now, we have in our demarche asked (for) the arrest and handover of those persons who are settled in Pakistan and who are fugitives of Indian law" 
"...there are lists of about 20 persons. (These) lists are sometimes altered and this exercise is going on and we have renewed it in our demarche", Mukherjee said, adding that India "will await" Pakistan's response in the Indian-Arab forum.
In an interview with NDTV, Pranab Mukherjee had not ruled out the option of military strikes against terror camps in Pakistan. Mukherjee said that every country has the right to protect its territorial integrity, and take appropriate action when necessary. He also said that it has become difficult to continue the peace process with Pakistan in this.
Denials from Pakistan.
Pakistan claimed that it had not received any letter from Mohammad Ajmal Amir, the lone terrorist arrested for the Mumbai attacks, seeking legal aid. It also repeated its denial on his Pakistani nationality, saying it needed "incontrovertible" evidence.
The Mumbai police had said that the captured terrorist Ajmal Amir had written a letter to the Pakistan High Commission in India, asking for help, and that the letter had been given to India's central government. But the Pakistan High Commissioner to India, Shahid Malik, told Karan Thapar in the "India Tonight" program of CNBC TV-18, that no such letter had been received.
According to Pakistan's "Dawn" newspaper, Ajmal's father in Pakistan had admitted that the man seen in photographs at the CST railway station was indeed his son. But the High Commissioner said they needed "something which is incontrovertible, which cannot be challenged in a court of law".
Pakistan was also not contemplating giving Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, access to the FBI for investigation.
Interpol involvement.
Shortly after the Mumbai attacks, the Interpol team visited India and "promised help in securing the details of the 10 gunmen who attacked several places in Mumbai, 26 November, leaving at least 173 people dead and more than 300 others injured".
Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble arrived in Islamabad on Tuesday, 23 December, for talks over Indian allegations of involvement with Pakistan-based militant groups in the Mumbai terror attacks. Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble met Pakistan's security officials the same day.
However, in a later press-conference, the Interpol chief said that India didn't share any specific information with the Interpol regarding the terror attacks. He said that Interpol had the same information that had been with media and the general public. Pakistan's Minister for Information and Broadcasting Sherry Rehman claimed that this statement somehow supported Pakistan government's stance that Indian government has yet to share substantial and credible evidence with them, and again offered help in due cooperation to India, for joint investigations into the Mumbai attacks.
On 10 March, India gave Interpol the DNA of the attackers.
Military preparations.
On 7 December, US Senator John McCain relayed a message from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, to a group of Pakistanis at a lunch in Lahore, that if Pakistan did not arrest those involved with the attacks, India would begin aerial attacks against Pakistan.
Pakistan Information Minister Sherry Rehman said that "Our air force is on alert, and ready to face any eventuality". Ali Abbas Rizvi quoted a source as saying, "They may have wanted to know whether the PAF was on five-minute alert or cockpit alert, and thereby find out the reaction time".
On 19 December, private intelligence agency Stratfor, in its latest report, said, "Indian military operations against targets in Pakistan have in fact been prepared, and await the signal to go forward". They also wrote that, "Indian military preparations, unlike previous cases, will be carried out in stealth". India's Border Security Force (BSF) has been put on high alert on the western sector, as well as the eastern sector, in order to prevent terrorist infiltration.
On 22 December, Pakistan began combat air patrol (CAP) over several cities, including Islamabad, Lahore, and Rawalpindi, which began a panic among Pakistani civilians. Many Pakistani civilians "started making frantic phone calls to media houseto enquire about whether a war has been declared". Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said, "Pakistan defence forces and armed forces are ready to face any challenge, as Pak has the full right to defend itself". Pakistani PM Yousuf Raza Gilani said, "Pakistan remains united and is ready to fight anyone to defend itself". Pakistani Defense Minister Ahmad Mukhtar Chaudhry said, "If India tried to thrust war, then the armed forces of Pakistan have all the potential and right to defend [Pakistan".
According to Pakistani media, India had started deploying troops along the Rajasthan border, and had tightened security in and around the defence airstrips. More radars and quick reaction teams were then deployed along the India-Pakistan border. Indian forces were on regular firing exercises at locations, like Lathi Firing Range in Jaisalmer, Mahsan in Bikaner, Suratgarh and Ganganagar.
On 23 December, Kamal Hyder, Al Jazeera's correspondent in Pakistan, wrote that the Pakistani "navy, air force and army were on red alert" and that "the chiefs of Pakistan's three armed forces were holding what had been described as an emergency meeting at general headquarters in Rawalpindi". He also wrote that "Pakistani air force have been seen visibly in a number of locations flying close to the Pakistani-India border, in what is being described as an aggressive patrolling mode, following reports that India is planning pre-emptive strikes against locations in Pakistan". A Pakistani airforce spokesperson said "[in view of the current environment, the PAF has enhanced its vigilance". Pakistani army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, said that Pakistan would mount an equal response "within minutes", to any Indian attack. Pakistan continued to combat air patrol over several cities.
The Taliban and affiliated groups openly declared their solidarity with Pakistan. The banned Tehrik-e-Taliban had proclaimed that they would send "thousands of (their) well-armed militants" in order to wage jihad against India if war should break out. Hundreds of would-be bombers were equipped with suicide jackets and explosive-laden vehicles.
On 24 December, P.K. Barbora, the air officer commanding-in-chief of Western Air Command, said "IAF has earmarked 5,000 targets in Pakistan. But whether we will cross the LoC or the International Border to hit the enemy targets will have to be decided by the political leadership of the country". India Today reported that "Indian Air Force fighter planes are engaged in round the clock sorties. An unusual hectic activity of Indian Air Force has been visible along the border for past some days". On the same day, Stratfor confirmed that "the state government of Rajasthan has ordered residents of its border villages to be prepared for relocation". President Asif Ali Zardari said "We will defend the country till the last drop of our blood", and "e will defend the country till our last breath". Pakistan began deploying warplanes to forward air bases.
On 25 December, however, the ruling UPA government in India played down apprehensions of an imminent military conflagration. The Indian Prime Minister made it clear that "nobody wanted war". The Indian Air Force also downplayed the sorties by PAF fighter jets, saying it was an air defence exercise. Officials in New Delhi were amused at Pakistan air force's attempt to create war hysteria in the region. However, R. C. Dhyani, DIG of Rajasthan frontier BSF, said, " lot of military movement is being noticed in districts just across the international border for the last few days, which is not normal" and "Pakistan has deployed more troops across border".
Leader of the House Raza Rabbani, said that any surgical strike into its territory would be taken as an act of war and would be repulsed with "full force", and that "ach and every inch of the country will be safeguarded". India moved MiG-29s to Hindon air base, located near New Delhi, in order "to protect the capital from aerial threats". The Pakistani city of Mianwali began a blackout.
Pakistan continued deployment, and moved the 10th Brigade to the outskirts of Lahore, and the 3rd Armored Brigade to Jhelum. The 10th Infantry Division and the 11th Infantry Division had been placed on high alert. The Indian Army deployed quick reaction teams (QRTs) along the border, which "precede the movement of bridging equipment – to cross canals in Punjab – and of heavy guns".
Amir Mir of "Daily News and Analysis" wrote that "Pakistan's military leadership has advised president Asif Ali Zardari to take back his statement made last month, that his country would not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the event of a conflict with India".
On 26 December, Pakistan cancelled all military leave, and activated contacts with friendly countries and military partners. Pakistan deployed troops to "protect vital points along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir and the international border with India". Pakistani Foreign Minister Quresh said that, "if war is imposed, we will respond to it like a brave, self-respecting nation". Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held a second meeting of the Nuclear Command Authority to "discuss all the options available to India".
Pakistan deployed the 14th Infantry Division to Kasur and Sialkot, close to the border. India advised its citizens not to travel to Pakistan. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with the chiefs of the Indian air force, army, and navy.
On 27 December, India's largest opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), called for all travel between India and Pakistan to be stopped, and for the recall of the Indian High Commissioner from Pakistan. The Pakistani Army alerted retired army personnel to be ready to be called back to active duty. On 28 December, Pakistan postponed all officer training courses.
On 29 December, the leaders of the Indian and Pakistani armies spoke over their red telephone, in order to avert an accidental nuclear war. The President of the BJP, Rajnath Singh, called for a joint India-US military action against Pakistan. John McCain said, "The Indians are on the verge of some kind of attack on Pakistan".
On 30 December, Pakistani media stated: "The service chiefs of all of the branches of India's military were told to stay in the country in order to achieve 'complete readiness'. All units that are on exercises have been ordered to remain so indefinitely, and to indicate any equipment or ammunition they need". However, this was not backed by Indian nor international media.
Pakistani deployments.
The Pakistani military had cancelled all leave. Elements of the Pakistani Airforce had been deployed to frontline bases. The IV Corp, with 60,000 troops, has been deployed to Lahore. Pakistan had deployed the 3rd Armored Brigade to Jhelum, and the 10th Brigade, with 5,000 troops, to Lahore. The 10th Division had been deployed to Ichogul and the 11th Division had been deployed to Tilla. Pakistani Army units had been deployed to Kashmir and the Jammu sector of the border. The 14th Division, with 20,000 troops, had been deployed to Kasur and Sialkot.
Indian deployments.
India had put its Border Security Force, India's border patrol agency, on high alert. Mig-29s have been deployed to Hindon air base, in order to protect New Delhi. Later IAF sources claimed that the move was a result of intelligence inputs of an air attack on Delhi. The Indian Navy had moved six warships, including the INS "Jalashwa" and the INS "Ranveer", to the west coast.
Trials in Pakistan.
Indian and Pakistani police had exchanged DNA evidence, photographs, and items found with the attackers, to piece together a detailed portrait of the Mumbai plot. Police in Pakistan had arrested seven people, including Hammad Amin Sadiq, a homoeopathic pharmacist, who arranged bank accounts and secured supplies, and he and six others began their formal trial on 3 October 2009, in Pakistan, though Indian authorities say the prosecution stopped well short of top Lashkar leaders.
Impact on the United States.
US officials feared that should the firm evidence emerge that the Mumbai terror attacks were planned and directed from within Pakistan, it would certainly escalate tension between the neighbouring countries, and could also provoke an Indian military response, even strikes against terrorists, a media report said on Saturday. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, on Monday, urged Pakistan to give its "absolute, total" cooperation in finding those responsible for last week's attacks on Mumbai. Rice travelled to India on 4 December 2008, at the request of President George W. Bush, in the wake of the Mumbai attacks. She said that there is need for "direct and tough action" by Islamabad, even if the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks were "non-state actors".
"Secretary Rice's visit to India is a further demonstration of the United States' commitment to stand in solidarity with the people of India, as we all work together to hold these extremists accountable", White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said in a statement.
After visiting India, Condoleezza Rice travelled to Pakistan on 4 December 2008, to talk with the Pakistani government. She is quoted as saying, "We talked at length about the importance of Pakistan taking its responsibility to deal with those who may use Pakistan territory even if they are non-state actors".
However, some of the most wanted names on the list continue to operate openly in Pakistan. No action has been taken against them by the government of Pakistan.
Police forces in places like New York and Boston practised handling of similar situations, should they occur in the US.
Impact on the United Kingdom.
In the wake of the attacks, a new system of compensation for UK citizens caught up in terrorist attacks is being considered. However, "currently the UK government does not guarantee compensation for people injured in attacks abroad".
UK police feared similar attacks could occur in the country.
Citizens' Movements.
The Mumbai attack also triggered a chain of citizens' movements across India. People from all walks of life hit the streets with candles and placards to pay tributes to the victims of the tragedy almost every weekend after the 26/11 incident. While NSG commandos, Mumbai police officials, hotel staffers, etc. who participated in the operation to eliminate the terrorists became overnight heroes, the wrath of the citizens was directed towards the Government's inability to ensure adequate security to its citizens, and soon led to the chain of resignations, including that of the Indian Home Minister, Shivraj Patil. The gathering of citizens at the Gateway of India in Mumbai was unprecedented and historic. From India Gate and Jantar Mantar in New Delhi to marketplaces and street corners all across the country, India witnessed candlelight vigils by the common people. Some organised initiatives to carry forward the citizens' movement included a Hindustan Times-CNN-IBN Initiative, India Today Group's War Against Terror, and Hindustan Hamara Citizens' Initiative, besides a large number of blogs on the issue.
February 2009 Video release.
On 25 February 2009, new videos were released off of CCTV, displaying the inside of the hotel where the Mumbai siege took place.

Vīramitrodaya

The Vīramitrodaya is a Hindu law digest written by Mitamiśra which covers nearly every aspect of "Dharmaśāstra". The text also includes Vyavahāra as well, as the name would suggest. The work was done at the behest of Vīrasimha, the king of Orccha, from 1605-1627. The Privvy Council in the Benares School of Hindu Law considered the text to be a work of high authority. Mitamiśra's text includes hundreds of citations in which he analyzes and critiques numerous arguments, particularly those made by members of the Bengal school.

Hamahullah bin Muhammad bin Umar

Shaykh Shekna Ahmeda Hamahullah ben Muhammad ben Seydina Umar (1886–) was a Sufi Muslim religious leader, born in French Soudan (modern Mali) and died in France after being arrested and sent into exile in 1933 by the colonial government of French West Africa. While not the founder, he was the spiritual leader of a militant reform movement of the powerful Tijaniyyah sufi ṭarīqah (order, path, brotherhood), which has popularly taken his name, as Hamallayya or Hamallism.
Desciple.
Hamahullah was the first desciple of a Tijaniyyah reformer and mystic Muhammad ben Amadu (d. 1909), who along with doctrinal and ritual changes, stressed opposition to hierarchy and downplayed the importance of formal education. Led by Hamahullah, the movement spread in the 1920s in what was then French Soudan, modern Mali. It first took root amongst Wolof traders living in Nioro, but soon spread to servile caste Muslims in Mauretania and Mali.
Exile.
Hamahullah bin Muhammad bin Umar was exiled by French authorities from his home in Nioro du Sahel (Mali) to Mauretania in 1933 following clashes between his followers and local leaders, then to Côte d'Ivoire and finally France, but the movement survived his death in exile. The movement was eventually made illegal in French West Africa, but has continued, especially among the rural poor. Hamahullah's most prominent desciples included Tierno Bokar Salif Tall in Mali and Yacouba Sylla in Mauretania, with the movement continuing as a small but prosperous religious faction across contemporary West Africa.

Manglor

Manglors was a line of action figures released by the Ideal Toy Company in 1984 and 1985. The first wave consisted of Manglord (which was initially released with a playset Manglor Mountain), Manglosaurus and Manglodactyl. A second wave, packaged with plastic eggs, appeared in 1985, which included Manglodemon, Manglizard, and Manglodragon. The line consisted of flexible, unjointed (one piece), sticky, and mostly unpainted (some versions of Manglord had purple highlights) Sorbothane figures that were not able to stand on their own.
The line was very controversial for its advertising that promoted that not only could the figures be stretched and squashed, but could be torn apart and "return almost like new to their original yucky selves." Consumers Union's children's publication, "Penny Power", took on this claim and found that they could not get the product to live up to its advertising claims, leaving a Manglodemon in many pieces that they were unable to reassemble. The packaging of the toys encouraged children to mix and match the parts of the various Manglors, but it was not possible to get them to hold together as demonstrated.

DAMA/LIBRA

The DAMA/LIBRA experiment 
is a particle detector experiment designed to detect dark matter using the direct detection approach, by using a scintilation detector to search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in the galactic halo. The experiment aims to find an annual variation of the number of detection events, caused by the variation of the velocity of the detector relative to the dark matter halo as the Earth orbits the Sun. It is located at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy.
The detector is made of 25 highly radiopure scintillating thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) crystals placed in a 5 by 5 matrix. Each crystal is coupled to two low background photomultipliers. The detectors are placed inside a sealed copper box flushed with highly pure nitrogen; to reduce the natural environmental background the copper box is surrounded by a low background multi-ton shield. In addition, 1 m of concrete, made from the Gran Sasso rock material, almost fully surrounds this passive shield. The installation has a 3-level sealing system which prevents environmental air reaching the detectors. The whole installation is air-conditioned and several operative parameters are continuously monitored and recorded.
The DAMA/LIBRA data released so far correspond to 6 annual cycles. 
Considering these data together with those previously collected by DAMA/NaI over 7 annual cycles, the total exposure (1.17 ton x yr) has been collected over 13 annual cycles. 
This experiment has further confirmed the presence of model-independent evidence with high 
statistical significance on the basis of the dark matter signature.
As previously done for DAMA/NaI, careful investigations on absence of any significant systematics or side reaction in DAMA/LIBRA have been quantitatively carried out.
The obtained model independent evidence is compatible with a wide set of scenarios regarding the nature of the dark matter candidate and related astrophysical, nuclear and particle physics.
DAMA/LIBRA was upgraded in 2008 and in 2010. In particular, the upgrade in 2010 allows an increase of the set-up’s sensitivity, the lowering of the energy threshold, and several other kinds of investigations.

Nonomiya Shrine

, or the Shrine in the Country, is a Shinto shrine in the Arashiyama district on the west side of the city of Kyoto in Kyoto prefecture, Japan. The specific site of the shrine changed somewhat over time, as the location of the shrine was fixed anew by divination when a new imperial priestess was to undergo purification before traveling to take up her duties at Ise Shrine.
Saigu procession.
In the Heian period, successive imperial princesses stayed in the Nonomiya Shrine for a year or more to purify themselves before becoming representatives of the imperial family at the Ise Shrine in Mie prefecture. Contemporary annual processions recreate a scene from a picture scroll of the imperial court during the Heian period, starting from the shrine and continuing as far as the Togetsu-kyo Bridge, Arashiyama.
In literature.
Nonomiya Shrine appears in the tenth chapter of the "Tale of Genji". 
There are many plays and other works which are based on the narrative of Genji. In the Noh play, "The Shrine in the Fields" by Zeami, a scene features a priest praying when a girl enters; and, upon questioning, she tells the story of how,
when Lady Rokujo was staying at Nonomiya with her daughter who had been appointed as the Ise virgin, Genji came to her.

Mayannur

History.
Mayannur is a village and a part of the Kondazhy Grama Panchayat, right on the border of Thrissur District, 3 kilometers away from Ottapalam town in Palakkad district . The village connects the town of Ottapalam to Thrissur district through its famous 1.5 kilometers long bridge known as "Mayannur palam" which is the longest ever built over the river of "Bharathapuzha" & in the region of Malabar and is a by-pass to reach the city of Thrissur from the Valluvanad region. The place is best known for stone idols made of the soil from Mayannur which adorn various temples all over India. It can boast of several famous vintage Namboothiri Illams including Ottur Mana, Thekkedath Mana, Swarnath Mana, Pidikaparambu Mana. The late Ottur Unni Namboothiripadu, who composed ‘Syamasundaran’—a volume of devotional poems on Lord Krishna (published by the Guruvayur Devaswam), was a native of Mayannur. Mayannur is also home for a number of well known Nair families like Kolakunnath, Moothedath, Kandamchirakkal & Paramel. There are other communities in the village mainly Chettiyar, Ezhuthachan, Thandan etc. One of the prominent Thandan family in Mayannur is "Panthalaammoochi". 
Beautiful and silent Bharatapuzha (Nila) runs through the outskirts of this village. Even with a meagre population of about 8,000, it has a post office, a bank and schools. 
Mayannur Kavu is the abode of Shri Kurumba Bhagavathi. Annual festival of this temple is enthusiastically celebrated during April/May with a gorgeous procession of elephants carrying Bhagavathi’s idol. This is the time all non-resident Mayannurians reach home every year.
Mayannur serves as a perfect epitome of communal harmony. This place is home to temples dedicated to Lord Ram and Lord Siva. The folklore here says, Sultan Tipu’s army invaded the village and demolished the Moolannur Kavu which is in ruins since then. Mayannur also has a church, and quite a few Muslim families reside here in harmony. People respect each other’s religion and propagate unity.
Bhoodhan Colony, as its name denotes, is a colony built on the land donated by late Shri Sundara Iyer to Acharya Vinoba Bhave, founder of the Bhoodhan movement, when he visited Mayannur. 
K S Raman Menon Smaraka Grameena Vayanasala, is one of the many marvels of Mayannur. Kerala had very limited printing and publishing facilities in the early 19th century. Late Shri Kulakkunnath Raman Menon of Mayannur founded ‘B V Books’ in 1902 at Thiruvananthapuram. Later, he established the Kamalalaya Printing Press at Ottappalam. B V Books were the exclusive publishers for many a famous writers, including A R Rajaraja Varma, Kerala Varma and C V Raman Pillai. B V Books became famous for its publications, such as Kerala Paniniyam, Marthanda Varma, Dharma Raja and Chintavishtayaya Sitha etc. A library has since been established at Mayannur, in K Raman Menon’s memory. The Mayannur Gandhi Ashram here produce soaps and khadi clothes.
The village proudly owns Thanal www.thannal.org, an orphanage which is now home to around 32 children. Marriage of a girl who grew up in Thanal was recently celebrated with the blessings of thousands of Mayannurians

Tommy Brooker

William Thomas “Tommy” Brooker (born October 31, 1939 in Demopolis, Alabama) is a former American collegiate and Professional Football player.
A placekicker-end, Brooker played for the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs of the American Football League from 1962-1966.
Brooker played college football at the University of Alabama under legendary coach Bear Bryant. He was drafted by the Texans in the 17th round (131st overall) in the 1962 AFL Draft and by the Washington Redskins in the 16th round (211th overall) in the same year’s NFL Draft.
Doubling as an offensive end, Brooker had his best statistical season in his rookie year, 1962. He caught four passes, three for touchdowns, the only ones he would score during his career. He also made all 33 of his extra point attempts and kicked 12 of 22 field goals for a total of 87 points.
Brooker was a member of the Texans team that won the 1962 AFL Championship game, the Texans defeating the Houston Oilers (who had won the first two AFL title games, in 1960 and 1961) at Jeppesen Stadium. It would be the franchise’s final game before their move from Dallas to Kansas City. Teammate Bill Hull intercepted the Oilers' George Blanda late in the first overtime of Professional Football's longest championship game. Hull's interception allowed the Texans to start the second overtime with two runs by Jack Spikes to move the ball to the Oilers' 25-yard line, and Brooker kicked a field goal to give the Texans the win, 20 - 17. The field goal saved Texans star running back Abner Haynes from what could have been a costly error: at the start of the overtime, Haynes won the coin toss and stated that his team would “kick to the clock,” which not only gave the Oilers first possession, but put the wind at their backs (the Oilers having gotten the choice of which end zone to defend). The Texans saved Haynes from embarrassment by preventing Houston from scoring in the first overtime; after the teams switched sides for the second, Brooker kicked the winning field goal 2 minutes and 54 seconds in.
On September 8, 1963, in the Chiefs’ inaugural game since moving from Dallas, Brooker converted eight extra points in a 59-7 victory over the Denver Broncos. This remains tied as a franchise single-game record, Mike Mercer and Lawrence Tynes equaling it in 1966 and 2004 respectively.
Brooker enjoyed two more solid seasons in 1964 and 1965. In the former, during which he would be named to the AFL All-Star Game, he made eight field goals and led the AFL with 46 extra points in as many attempts, for a total of 70 points. In 1965 he kicked a career-high 13 field goals and was a perfect 37-for-37 in PATs, for 76 points.
In his career Brooker scored 290 points: the three touchdowns in 1962, 41 field goals in 85 attempts, and a perfect 149-for-149 in PATs. To date, he holds the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs record for most career extra point attempts without a miss.

Venugopal Chandrasekhar

Venugopal Chandrasekhar is a former National table tennis champion and Arjuna Award winner from Tamil Nadu, India.
National Champion.
He was exceptionally good player of table tennis and was National Champion. 
Among his major achievements are winning the Nationals, making the semi-final of the Commonwealth championships in 1982, and helping India progress to category I from II in the 1983 Tokyo World Championships.
Early days.
At the age of 12, Chandrashekhar played well known The Madras Port Trust tournament. He joined the Emesor sport's council and it helped him to improve his game. The training regimen included Yoga and prayers, apart from table tennis. Chandra became the Tamil Nadu state sub junior champion in 1970. In 1973 he became Tamil Nadu's junior champion and also entered the National quarter finals. Chandra's style was flamboyant and at a time when sports coverage on TV was very limited, tickets for his matches sold in black in towns that traditionally patronized table tennis like Indore and Pune. Later he won National Championship.
Tragedy : Negligence at hospital.
Chandra was twenty-five. He had some pain in knee and the world crumbled for this National Champion, when the minor knee operation in September 1984 at a renowned hospital went wrong. He was already the national champ and was making his mark on the international TT scene when he had to go in for knee surgery in Chennai Apollo hospital. But things went wrong on the operation table, wrong dosage of anesthesia played its part and Chandra suffered brain damage and he lost his vision and control over his limbs. He spent 36 days in a near-coma state and eighty-one days in the hospital as part of 'rehab'. The treatment abroad was funded mainly from responses to a public appeal by Chandra for funds. Members of the public, sportsmen from India and abroad, politicians and actors helped generously. The treatment abroad improved Chandra's condition a bit.
Lawsuit.
A lawsuit was filed in 1985 against the hospital and it was three years before it came to trial. The medical community's omertà was broken by a few brave doctors, especially an anesthetist from Maharashtra helped to demolish the hospital's case. During the trial it came to light that the orthopedic surgeon of the hospital had received training at arthroscopy only in workshops at UK and not in a medical school as part of the curriculum. Eight years after the operation, five years since the trail began, after examination of ten witnesses, after recording a thousand pages of evidence, the court delivered a verdict in favour of Chandra in mid-May 1993. The judgement pronounced that, "The plaintiff is entitled to in total, Rs 17,37,920.78 by way of special damages and general damages." A medico legal case of this proportion was unheard of in India. A young patient had sued a hospital for negligence and had won nearly twenty lakhs. Even the cynics of the Indian Judiciary were impressed. The hospital appealed against the decision, but ultimately settled after two years. During the trail years Chandra continued his treatment in India and abroad and worked at a State Bank of India to support himself. He was a gold medalist of Madras University(Economics) was to work as a cashier. A fight which he feels would not have been necessary had "human spirit prevailed over ego". After a prolonged struggle he triumphed.
Recovery.
Chandrasekhar has made a good recovery physically. He has regained 70% of his vision, though reading small letters on the computer and driving at night are still a problem.
Chandra was extremely popular with the crowd during his playing days through the sheer power of his personality and of course talent. 
Chandrasekhar was one of the sports professionals in India to ask for appearance money and also actively sought to improve player's working conditions. Chandrasekhar wrote a column on table tennis, 'TopSpin', for 'The Telegraph' and also covered tournaments for newspapers after his operation.
From a person equipped with razor sharp reflexes needed to play a game in which the ball typically travels at 100 km/h or more, Chandraselhar today is a person who does not have normal peripheral vision and cannot see beyond a few feet; he suffers from a condition called nystagmus - his eyeballs cannot focus. A bulb, for instance, appears as a series of points of light. Chandra runs an academy for young table tennis players and is married to Mala; they have a son, Sanjay.
Autobiography.
Chandrashekhar penned down, with the help of Seetha Srikanth, his painful struggle in his autobiography "My fightback from Death's door" which is published by Eastwest books, Chennai during 2006. 
There are times when I stumble on the footpath, and people have thought that I was drunk.
That is when it hurts for it is not my fault. Then I look at the computer in my office and cannot read the small letters. To be lesser than a normal human being is what pains me the most. But I know I have to carry on. There is no point in looking back. - V. Chandrasekhar.

Crosby Stuart Noyes

Crosby Stuart Noyes (February 16, 1825 - February 21, 1908) was the publisher of the Washington Evening Star.
Biography.
Noyes was born on February 16, 1825 in Minot, Maine. He was interested in writing from his childhood, publishing his own juvenile newspaper called the "Minot Notion" when he was fifteen. Maine newspapers later began to print humorous sketches that he had written. One such sketch, a dialect-heavy piece titled "A Yankee in a Cotton Factory"
was widely republished.
Having arranged to write letters from Washington for several New England newspapers, he travelled to Washington, D.C. in 1847; his funds running low and unable to afford train fare, he had to walk from Baltimore to Washington.
For several months, Noyes worked for a bookseller, as an usher in a theatre, and as a route agent for the Baltimore Sun before becoming a writer for a local weekly, the "Washington News". He also began writing reports in the form of letters for newspapers in Maine, Boston, and Philadelphia, and became part of the press gallery that covered the United States Congress.
In 1855 Noyes became a reporter for the "Evening Star", managed by William Douglas Wallach. Circulation increased in the decade before the American Civil War, and Noyes developed contacts with the Lincoln administration's cabinet such that the "Star" became an outlet for official announcements. In 1867 Noyes became editor-in-chief after Wallach sold the paper to Noyes and two other investors for $110,000.
After the Civil War, Noyes and his newspaper crusaded to improve Washington's buildings and infrastructure, encouraging the efforts of Alexander Robey Shepherd.
He married Elizabeth S. Williams in 1856. They had two sons, Theodore Williams and Frank Brett. Theodore was an associate editor at the "Evening Star", and 
Frank was the treasurer and business manager.
In 1893, Noyes and Brainard Warner, an early developer of Kensington, MD, built and stocked what became the first public library in the DC area, now known as the Noyes Children's Library in Kensington.
He died on February 21, 1908 in Pasadena, California.

Puthenchira

History.
Puthenchira and the surrounding areas were earlier known as Mahadevan Pattanam. In the second or the third century the Perumakkans created a ‘Chira’ (causeway/bund) for the purpose of agriculture. The Cheran Perumal designated the place for building the ‘Chira’ by throwing Puthen( the coin prevailing then). Since then it is believed that this place is called Puthenchira. 
Puthenchira was ruled by the king of Kodungallur after the Chera dynasty fell in the 9th Century. Later when Samudiri extended his territory, both Puthenchira and Kodungallur became the part of his empire. In the 18th Centaury when the Cochin king annexed the southern parts of the Samudiri Empire, this region became a part of the Cochin Empire. Later in 1761 when Samudiri attacked, the Cochin king sought help from Travancore.Travancore obliged and defeated Samudiri in the battle, delighted by this, the Cochin king gave Puthenchira to Divan Ayyappan Marthandapilla who was the commander of the Travancore army. The Divan dedicated Puthenchira to the Travancore king. So until the Trvancore Cochin merger in 1949 Puthenchira was a Travancore village in the Cochin kingdom.

Candy Rain (), also known as 愛情糖果雨(àiqíng tángguǒ yǔ), is a 2008 Taiwanese film directed by Chen Hung-I (陳宏一).
Plot.
"Candy Rain" is a romantic drama which combines four intimate, lyrical tales exploring lesbian relationship in contemporary Taiwan. In the first episode, a young girl escapes a broken love for the uncertainties of friendship (and more) in Taipei. In the second, another girl, seeking her ideal, finds herself involved with a wealthy woman instead. The third story follows a heroine trying to find a balance between marriage and separation from her true love. The final story portrays a volatile foursome anchored by singer-actress Karena Lam. A rich, bittersweet spectrum of love and loss, based on true stories.
Reception.
Critical response to the film has been mixed. Kozo of the Love HK Film website called "Candy Rain" "a light, lesbian-themed art film that's uneven and obvious in execution," but Russell Edwards of "Variety" gave the film mild praise for its "charming" performances and "gracefully shot" cinematography.
