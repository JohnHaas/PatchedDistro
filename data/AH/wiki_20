Hilbert space

The mathematical concept of a Hilbert space, named after David Hilbert, generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. It extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions. A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are complete: there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used.
Hilbert spaces arise naturally and frequently in mathematics and physics, typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces. The earliest Hilbert spaces were studied from this point of view in the first decade of the 20th century by David Hilbert, Erhard Schmidt, and Frigyes Riesz. They are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, Fourier analysis (which includes applications to signal processing and heat transfer)—and ergodic theory, which forms the mathematical underpinning of thermodynamics. John von Neumann coined the term "Hilbert space" for the abstract concept that underlies many of these diverse applications. The success of Hilbert space methods ushered in a very fruitful era for functional analysis. Apart from the classical Euclidean spaces, examples of Hilbert spaces include spaces of square-integrable functions, spaces of sequences, Sobolev spaces consisting of generalized functions, and Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions.
Geometric intuition plays an important role in many aspects of Hilbert space theory. Exact analogs of the Pythagorean theorem and parallelogram law hold in a Hilbert space. At a deeper level, perpendicular projection onto a subspace (the analog of "dropping the altitude" of a triangle) plays a significant role in optimization problems and other aspects of the theory. An element of a Hilbert space can be uniquely specified by its coordinates with respect to a set of coordinate axes (an orthonormal basis), in analogy with Cartesian coordinates in the plane. When that set of axes is countably infinite, this means that the Hilbert space can also usefully be thought of in terms of infinite sequences that are square-summable. Linear operators on a Hilbert space are likewise fairly concrete objects: in good cases, they are simply transformations that stretch the space by different factors in mutually perpendicular directions in a sense that is made precise by the study of their spectrum.
Definition and illustration.
Motivating example: Euclidean space.
One of the most familiar examples of a Hilbert space is the Euclidean space consisting of three-dimensional vectors, denoted by R3, and equipped with the dot product. The dot product takes two vectors x and y, and produces a real number x·y. If x and y are represented in Cartesian coordinates, then the dot product is defined by
The dot product satisfies the properties:
An operation on pairs of vectors that, like the dot product, satisfies these three properties is known as a (real) inner product. A vector space equipped with such an inner product is known as a (real) inner product space. Every finite-dimensional inner product space is also a Hilbert space. The basic feature of the dot product that connects it with Euclidean geometry is that it is related to both the length (or norm) of a vector, denoted ||x||, and to the angle θ between two vectors x and y by means of the formula
Multivariable calculus in Euclidean space relies on the ability to compute limits, and to have useful criteria for concluding that limits exist. A mathematical series
consisting of vectors in R3 is absolutely convergent provided that the sum of the lengths converges as an ordinary series of real numbers:
Just as with a series of scalars, a series of vectors that converges absolutely also converges to some limit vector L in the Euclidean space, in the sense that
This property expresses the "completeness" of Euclidean space: that a series that converges absolutely also converges in the ordinary sense.
Definition.
A Hilbert space "H" is a real or complex inner product space that is also a complete metric space with respect to the distance function induced by the inner product. To say that "H" is a complex inner product space means that "H" is a complex vector space on which there is an inner product formula_6 associating a complex number to each pair of elements "x","y" of "H" that satisfies the following properties:
It follows from properties 1 and 2 that a complex inner product is antilinear in its second argument, meaning that
A real inner product space is defined in the same way, except that "H" is a real vector space and the inner product takes real values. Such an inner product will be bilinear: that is, linear in each argument.
The norm is the real-valued function
and the distance "d" between two points "x","y" in "H" is defined in terms of the norm by
That this function is a distance function means (1) that it is symmetric in "x" and "y", (2) that the distance between "x" and itself is zero, and otherwise the distance between "x" and "y" must be positive, and (3) that the triangle inequality holds, meaning that the length of one leg of a triangle "xyz" cannot exceed the sum of the lengths of the other two legs:
This last property is ultimately a consequence of the more fundamental Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, which asserts
with equality if and only if "x" and "y" are linearly dependent.
Relative to a distance function defined in this way, any inner product space is a metric space, and sometimes is known as a pre-Hilbert space. Any pre-Hilbert space that is additionally also a complete space is a Hilbert space. Completeness is expressed using a form of the Cauchy criterion for sequences in "H": a pre-Hilbert space "H" is complete if every Cauchy sequence converges with respect to this norm to an element in the space. Completeness can be characterized by the following equivalent condition: if a series of vectors formula_15 converges absolutely in the sense that
then the series converges in "H", in the sense that the partial sums converge to an element of "H".
As a complete normed space, Hilbert spaces are by definition also Banach spaces. As such they are topological vector spaces, in which topological notions like the openness and closedness of subsets are well-defined. Of special importance is the notion of a closed linear subspace of a Hilbert space that, with the inner product induced by restriction, is also complete (being a closed set in a complete metric space) and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right.
Second example: sequence spaces.
The sequence space "ℓ"2 consists of all infinite sequences z = ("z""1","z"2...) of complex numbers such that the series
converges. The inner product on "ℓ"2 is defined by
with the latter series converging as a consequence of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.
Completeness of the space holds provided that whenever a series of elements from "ℓ"2 converges absolutely (in norm), then it converges to an element of "ℓ"2. The proof is basic in mathematical analysis, and permits mathematical series of elements of the space to be manipulated with the same ease as series of complex numbers (or vectors in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space).
History.
Prior to the development of Hilbert spaces, other generalizations of Euclidean spaces were known to mathematicians and physicists. In particular, the idea of an abstract linear space had gained some traction towards the end of the 19th century: this is a space whose elements can be added together and multiplied by scalars (such as real or complex numbers) without necessarily identifying these elements with "geometric" vectors, such as position and momentum vectors in physical systems. Other objects studied by mathematicians at the turn of the 20th century, in particular spaces of sequences (including series) and spaces of functions, can naturally be thought of as linear spaces. Functions, for instance, can be added together or multiplied by constant scalars, and these operations obey the algebraic laws satisfied by addition and scalar multiplication of spatial vectors.
In the first decade of the 20th century, parallel developments led to the introduction of Hilbert spaces. The first of these was the observation, which arose during David Hilbert and Erhard Schmidt's study of integral equations, that two square-integrable real-valued functions "f" and "g" on an interval ["a","b"] have an "inner product"
which has many of the familiar properties of the Euclidean dot product. In particular, the idea of an orthogonal family of functions has meaning. Schmidt exploited the similarity of this inner product with the usual dot product to prove an analog of the spectral decomposition for an operator of the form
where "K" is a continuous function symmetric in "x" and "y". The resulting eigenfunction expansion expresses the function "K" as a series of the form
where the functions "φ""n" are orthogonal in the sense that for all . The individual terms in this series are sometimes referred to as elementary product solutions. However, there are eigenfunction expansions that fail to converge in a suitable sense to a square-integrable function: the missing ingredient, which ensures convergence, is completeness.
The second development was the Lebesgue integral, an alternative to the Riemann integral introduced by Henri Lebesgue in 1904. The Lebesgue integral made it possible to integrate a much broader class of functions. In 1907, Frigyes Riesz and Ernst Sigismund Fischer independently proved that the space "L"2 of square Lebesgue-integrable functions is a complete metric space. As a consequence of the interplay between geometry and completeness, the 19th century results of Joseph Fourier, Friedrich Bessel and Marc-Antoine Parseval on trigonometric series easily carried over to these more general spaces, resulting in a geometrical and analytical apparatus now usually known as the Riesz–Fischer theorem.
Further basic results were proved in the early 20th century. For example, the Riesz representation theorem was independently established by Maurice Fréchet and Frigyes Riesz in 1907. John von Neumann coined the term "abstract Hilbert space" in his work on unbounded Hermitian operators. Although other mathematicians such as Hermann Weyl and Norbert Wiener had already studied particular Hilbert spaces in great detail, often from a physically motivated point of view, von Neumann gave the first complete and axiomatic treatment of them. Von Neumann later used them in his seminal work on the foundations of quantum mechanics, and in his continued work with Eugene Wigner. The name "Hilbert space" was soon adopted by others, for example by Hermann Weyl in his book on quantum mechanics and the theory of groups.
The significance of the concept of a Hilbert space was underlined with the realization that it offers one of the best mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics. In short, the states of a quantum mechanical system are vectors in a certain Hilbert space, the observables are hermitian operators on that space, the symmetries of the system are unitary operators, and measurements are orthogonal projections. The relation between quantum mechanical symmetries and unitary operators provided an impetus for the development of the unitary representation theory of groups, initiated in the 1928 work of Hermann Weyl. On the other hand, in the early 1930s it became clear that classical mechanics can be described in terms of Hilbert space (Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics) and that certain properties of classical dynamical systems can be analyzed using Hilbert space techniques in the framework of ergodic theory.
The algebra of observables in quantum mechanics is naturally an algebra of operators defined on a Hilbert space, according to Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics formulation of quantum theory. Von Neumann began investigating operator algebras in the 1930s, as rings of operators on a Hilbert space. The kind of algebras studied by von Neumann and his contemporaries are now known as von Neumann algebras. In the 1940s, Israel Gelfand, Mark Naimark and Irving Segal gave a definition of a kind of operator algebras called C*-algebras that on the one hand made no reference to an underlying Hilbert space, and on the other extrapolated many of the useful features of the operator algebras that had previously been studied. The spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators in particular that underlies much of the existing Hilbert space theory was generalized to C*-algebras. These techniques are now basic in abstract harmonic analysis and representation theory.
Examples.
Lebesgue spaces.
Lebesgue spaces are function spaces associated to measure spaces ("X", "M", "μ"), where "X" is a set, "M" is a σ-algebra of subsets of "X", and "μ" is a countably additive measure on "M". Let "L"2("X", μ) be the space of those complex-valued measurable functions on "X" for which the Lebesgue integral of the square of the absolute value of the function is finite, i.e., for a function "f" in "L"2("X",μ),
and where functions are identified if and only if they differ only on a set of measure zero.
The inner product of functions "f" and "g" in "L"2("X", μ) is then defined as
For "f" and "g" in "L"2, this integral exists because of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, and defines an inner product on the space. Equipped with this inner product, "L"2 is in fact complete. The Lebesgue integral is essential to ensure completeness: on domains of real numbers, for instance, not enough functions are Riemann integrable.
The Lebesgue spaces appear in many natural settings. The spaces "L"2(R) and "L"2(of square-integrable functions with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the real line and unit interval, respectively, are natural domains on which to define the Fourier transform and Fourier series. In other situations, the measure may be something other than the ordinary Lebesgue measure on the real line. For instance, if "w" is any positive measurable function, the space of all measurable functions "f" on the interval [0, 1 satisfying
is called the weighted "L"2 space "L"([0,1]), and "w" is called the weight function. The inner product is defined by
The weighted space "L"(is identical with the Hilbert space "L"2([0,1,μ) where the measure μ of a Lebesgue-measurable set "A" is defined by
Weighted "L"2 spaces like this are frequently used to study orthogonal polynomials, because different families of orthogonal polynomials are orthogonal with respect to different weighting functions.
Sobolev spaces.
Sobolev spaces, denoted by "H""s" or , are Hilbert spaces. These are a special kind of function space in which differentiation may be performed, but that (unlike other Banach spaces such as the Hölder spaces) support the structure of an inner product. Because differentiation is permitted, Sobolev spaces are a convenient setting for the theory of partial differential equations. They also form the basis of the theory of direct methods in the calculus of variations.
For "s" a non-negative integer and , the Sobolev space "H""s"(Ω) contains L2 functions whose weak derivatives of order up to "s" are also L2. The inner product in "H"s(Ω) is
where the dot indicates the dot product in the Euclidean space of partial derivatives of each order. Sobolev spaces can also be defined when "s" is not an integer.
Sobolev spaces are also studied from the point of view of spectral theory, relying more specifically on the Hilbert space structure. If Ω is a suitable domain, then one can define the Sobolev space "H""s"(Ω) as the space of Bessel potentials; roughly,
Here Δ is the Laplacian and (1 − Δ)−"s"/2 is understood in terms of the spectral mapping theorem. Apart from providing a workable definition of Sobolev spaces for non-integer "s", this definition also has particularly desirable properties under the Fourier transform that make it ideal for the study of pseudodifferential operators. Using these methods on a compact Riemannian manifold, one can obtain for instance the Hodge decomposition, which is the basis of Hodge theory.
Spaces of holomorphic functions.
The Hardy spaces are function spaces, arising in complex analysis and harmonic analysis, whose elements are certain holomorphic functions in a complex domain. Let "U" denote the unit disc in the complex plane. Then the Hardy space "H"2("U") is defined as the space of holomorphic functions "f" on "U" such that the means
remain bounded for . The norm on this Hardy space is defined by
Hardy spaces in the disc are related to Fourier series. A function "f" is in "H"2("U") if and only if
where
Thus "H"2("U") consists of those functions that are L2 on the circle, and whose negative frequency Fourier coefficients vanish.
The Bergman spaces are another family of Hilbert spaces of holomorphic functions. Let "D" be a bounded open set in the complex plane (or a higher dimensional complex space) and let "L"2,"h"("D") be the space of holomorphic functions "f" in "D" that are also in "L"2("D") in the sense that
where the integral is taken with respect to the Lebesgue measure in "D". Clearly "L"2, "h"("D") is a subspace of "L"2("D"); in fact, it is a closed subspace, and so a Hilbert space in its own right. This is a consequence of the estimate, valid on compact subsets "K" of "D", that
which in turn follows from Cauchy's integral formula. Thus convergence of a sequence of holomorphic functions in "L"2("D") implies also compact convergence, and so the limit function is also holomorphic. Another consequence of this inequality is that the linear functional that evaluates a function "f" at a point of "D" is actually continuous on "L"2,"h"("D"). The Riesz representation theorem implies that the evaluation functional can be represented as an element of "L"2,"h"("D"). Thus, for every "z" ∈ "D", there is a function η"z" ∈ "L"2,"h"("D") such that
for all "f" ∈ "L"2,"h"("D"). The integrand
is known as the Bergman kernel of "D". This integral kernel satisfies a reproducing property
A Bergman space is an example of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which is a Hilbert space of functions along with a kernel "K"(ζ,"z") that verifies a reproducing property analogous to this one. The Hardy space "H"2("D") also admits a reproducing kernel, known as the Szegő kernel. Reproducing kernels are common in other areas of mathematics as well. For instance, in harmonic analysis the Poisson kernel is a reproducing kernel for the Hilbert space of square-integrable harmonic functions in the unit ball. That the latter is a Hilbert space at all is a consequence of the mean value theorem for harmonic functions.
Applications.
Many of the applications of Hilbert spaces exploit the fact that Hilbert spaces support generalizations of simple geometric concepts like projection and change of basis from their usual finite dimensional setting. In particular, the spectral theory of continuous self-adjoint linear operators on a Hilbert space generalizes the usual spectral decomposition of a matrix, and this often plays a major role in applications of the theory to other areas of mathematics and physics.
Sturm–Liouville theory.
In the theory of ordinary differential equations, spectral methods on a suitable Hilbert space are used to study the behavior of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of differential equations. For example, the Sturm–Liouville problem arises in the study of the harmonics of waves in a violin string or a drum, and is a central problem in ordinary differential equations. The problem is a differential equation of the form
for an unknown function "y" on an interval ["a","b"], satisfying general homogeneous Robin boundary conditions
The functions "p", "q", and "w" are given in advance, and the problem is to find the function "y" and constants λ for which the equation has a solution. The problem only has solutions for certain values of λ, called eigenvalues of the system, and this is a consequence of the spectral theorem for compact operators applied to the integral operator defined by the Green's function for the system. Furthermore, another consequence of this general result is that the eigenvalues λ of the system can be arranged in an increasing sequence tending to infinity.
Partial differential equations.
Hilbert spaces form a basic tool in the study of partial differential equations. For many classes of partial differential equations, such as linear elliptic equations, it is possible to consider a generalized solution (known as a weak solution) by enlarging the class of functions. Many weak formulations involve the class of Sobolev functions, which is a Hilbert space. A suitable weak formulation reduces to a geometrical problem the analytic problem of finding a solution or, often what is more important, showing that a solution exists and is unique for given boundary data. For linear elliptic equations, one geometrical result that ensures unique solvability for a large class of problems is the Lax–Milgram theorem. This strategy forms the rudiment of the Galerkin method (a finite element method) for numerical solution of partial differential equations.
A typical example is the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a bounded domain Ω in R2. The weak formulation consists of finding a function "u" such that, for all continuously differentiable functions "v" in Ω vanishing on the boundary:
This can be recast in terms of the Hilbert space "H"(Ω) consisting of functions "u" such that "u", along with its weak partial derivatives, are square integrable on Ω, and vanish on the boundary. The question then reduces to finding "u" in this space such that for all "v" in this space
where "a" is a continuous bilinear form, and "b" is a continuous linear functional, given respectively by
Since the Poisson equation is elliptic, it follows from Poincaré's inequality that the bilinear form "a" is coercive. The Lax–Milgram theorem then ensures the existence and uniqueness of solutions of this equation.
Hilbert spaces allow for many elliptic partial differential equations to be formulated in a similar way, and the Lax–Milgram theorem is then a basic tool in their analysis. With suitable modifications, similar techniques can be applied to parabolic partial differential equations and certain hyperbolic partial differential equations.
Ergodic theory.
The field of ergodic theory is the study of the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. The protypical case of a field that ergodic theory applies to is thermodynamics, in which—though the microscopic state of a system is extremely complicated (it is impossible to understand the ensemble of individual collisions between particles of matter)—the average behavior over sufficiently long time intervals is tractable. The laws of thermodynamics are assertions about such average behavior. In particular, one formulation of the zeroth law of thermodynamics asserts that over sufficiently long timescales, the only functionally independent measurement that one can make of a thermodynamic system in equilibrium is its total energy, in the form of temperature.
An ergodic dynamical system is one for which, apart from the energy—measured by the Hamiltonian—there are no other functionally independent conserved quantities on the phase space. More explicitly, suppose that the energy "E" is fixed, and let Ω"E" be the subset of the phase space consisting of all states of energy "E" (an energy surface), and let "T""t" denote the evolution operator on the phase space. The dynamical system is ergodic if there are no continuous non-constant functions on Ω"E" such that
for all "w" on Ω"E" and all time "t". Liouville's theorem implies that there exists a measure μ on the energy surface that is invariant under the time translation. As a result, time translation is a unitary transformation of the Hilbert space "L"2(Ω"E",μ) consisting of square-integrable functions on the energy surface Ω"E" with respect to the inner product
The von Neumann mean ergodic theorem states the following:
For an ergodic system, the fixed set of the time evolution consists only of the constant functions, so the ergodic theorem implies the following: for any function "f" ∈ "L"2(Ω"E",μ),
That is, the long time average of an observable "f" is equal to its expectation value over an energy surface.
Fourier analysis.
One of the basic goals of Fourier analysis is to decompose a function into a (possibly infinite) linear combination of given basis functions: the associated Fourier series. The classical Fourier series associated to a function "f" defined on the interval 1 is a series of the form
where
The example of adding up the first few terms in a Fourier series for a sawtooth function is shown in the figure. The basis functions are sine waves with wavelengths λ/"n" ("n"=integer) shorter than the wavelength λ of the sawtooth itself (except for "n"=1, the "fundamental" wave). All basis functions have nodes at the nodes of the sawtooth, but all but the fundamental have additional nodes. The oscillation of the summed terms about the sawtooth is called the Gibbs phenomenon.
A significant problem in classical Fourier series asks in what sense the Fourier series converges, if at all, to the function "f". Hilbert space methods provide one possible answer to this question. The functions "en"(θ) = e2πi"n"θ form an orthogonal basis of the Hilbert space "L"2([0,1]). Consequently, any square-integrable function can be expressed as a series
and, moreover, this series converges in the Hilbert space sense (that is, in the "L"2 mean).
The problem can also be studied from the abstract point of view: every Hilbert space has an orthonormal basis, and every element of the Hilbert space can be written in a unique way as a sum of multiples of these basis elements. The coefficients appearing on these basis elements are sometimes known abstractly as the Fourier coefficients of the element of the space. The abstraction is especially useful when it is more natural to use different basis functions for a space such as "L"2([0,1]). In many circumstances, it is desirable not to decompose a function into trigonometric functions, but rather into orthogonal polynomials or wavelets for instance, and in higher dimensions into spherical harmonics.
For instance, if "e""n" are any orthonormal basis functions of "L"2then a given function in "L"2[0,1 can be approximated as a finite linear combination
The coefficients {"a""j"} are selected to make the magnitude of the difference ||||2 as small as possible. Geometrically, the best approximation is the orthogonal projection of "ƒ" onto the subspace consisting of all linear combinations of the {"e""j"}, and can be calculated by
That this formula minimizes the difference ||||2 is a consequence of Bessel's inequality and Parseval's formula.
In various applications to physical problems, a function can be decomposed into physically meaningful eigenfunctions of a differential operator (typically the Laplace operator): this forms the foundation for the spectral study of functions, in reference to the spectrum of the differential operator. A concrete physical application involves the problem of hearing the shape of a drum: given the fundamental modes of vibration that a drumhead is capable of producing, can one infer the shape of the drum itself? The mathematical formulation of this question involves the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplace equation in the plane, that represent the fundamental modes of vibration in direct analogy with the integers that represent the fundamental modes of vibration of the violin string.
Spectral theory also underlies certain aspects of the Fourier transform of a function. Whereas Fourier analysis decomposes a function defined on a compact set into the discrete spectrum of the Laplacian (which corresponds to the vibrations of a violin string or drum), the Fourier transform of a function is the decomposition of a function defined on all of Euclidean space into its components in the continuous spectrum of the Laplacian. The Fourier transformation is also geometrical, in a sense made precise by the Plancherel theorem, that asserts that it is an isometry of one Hilbert space (the "time domain") with another (the "frequency domain"). This isometry property of the Fourier transformation is a recurring theme in abstract harmonic analysis, as evidenced for instance by the Plancherel theorem for spherical functions occurring in noncommutative harmonic analysis.
Quantum mechanics.
In the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics, developed by John von Neumann, the possible states (more precisely, the pure states) of a quantum mechanical system are represented by unit vectors (called "state vectors") residing in a complex separable Hilbert space, known as the state space, well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the projectivization of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system; for example, the position and momentum states for a single non-relativistic spin zero particle is the space of all square-integrable functions, while the states for the spin of a single proton are unit elements of the two-dimensional complex Hilbert space of spinors. Each observable is represented by a self-adjoint linear operator acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate.
The time evolution of a quantum state is described by the Schrödinger equation, in which the Hamiltonian, the operator corresponding to the total energy of the system, generates time evolution.
The inner product between two state vectors is a complex number known as a probability amplitude. During an ideal measurement of a quantum mechanical system, the probability that a system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate is given by the square of the absolute value of the probability amplitudes between the initial and final states. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator—which explains the choice of self-adjoint operators, for all the eigenvalues must be real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator.
For a general system, states are typically not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace one on a Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, the effects of a single measurement can influence other parts of a system in a manner that is described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the idealization for pure states.
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is represented by the statement that the operators corresponding to certain observables do not commute, and gives a specific form that the commutator must have.
Properties.
Pythagorean identity.
Two vectors "u" and "v" in a Hilbert space "H" are orthogonal when formula_52 = 0. The notation for this is . More generally, when "S" is a subset in "H", the notation means that "u" is orthogonal to every element from "S".<br>
When "u" and "v" are orthogonal, one has
By induction on "n", this is extended to any family "u"1...,"un" of "n" orthogonal vectors,
Whereas the Pythagorean identity as stated is valid in any inner product space, completeness is required for the extension of the Pythagorean identity to series. A series Σ "uk" of "orthogonal" vectors converges in "H"  if and only if the series of squares of norms converges, and
Furthermore, the sum of a series of orthogonal vectors is independent of the order in which it is taken.
Parallelogram identity and polarization.
By definition, every Hilbert space is also a Banach space. Furthermore, in every Hilbert space the following parallelogram identity holds:
Conversely, every Banach space in which the parallelogram identity holds is a Hilbert space, and the inner product is uniquely determined by the norm by the polarization identity. For real Hilbert spaces, the polarization identity is
For complex Hilbert spaces, it is
The parallelogram law implies that any Hilbert space is a uniformly convex Banach space.
Best approximation.
If "C" is a non-empty closed convex subset of a Hilbert space "H" and "x" a point in "H", there exists a unique point "y" ∈ "C" that minimizes the distance between "x" and points in "C",
This is equivalent to saying that there is a point with minimal norm in the translated convex set "D" = . The proof consists in showing that every minimizing sequence ("dn") ⊂ "D" is Cauchy (using the parallelogram identity) hence converges (using completeness) to a point in "D" that has minimal norm. More generally, this holds in any uniformly convex Banach space.
When this result is applied to a closed subspace "F" of "H", it can be shown that the point "y" ∈ "F" closest to "x" is characterized by
This point "y" is the "orthogonal projection" of "x" onto "F", and the mapping "PF" : is linear (see Orthogonal complements and projections). This result is especially significant in applied mathematics, especially numerical analysis, where it forms the basis of least squares methods .
In particular, when "F" is not equal to "H", one can find a non-zero vector "v" orthogonal to "F" (select "x" not in "F" and "v" = . A very useful criterion is obtained by applying this observation to the closed subspace "F" generated by a subset "S" of "H".
Duality.
The dual space "H*" is the space of all continuous linear functions from the space "H" into the base field. It carries a natural norm, defined by
This norm satisfies the parallelogram law, and so the dual space is also an inner product space. The dual space is also complete, and so it is a Hilbert space in its own right.
The Riesz representation theorem affords a convenient description of the dual. To every element "u" of "H", there is a unique element φ"u" of "H*", defined by
The mapping formula_63 is an antilinear mapping from "H" to "H*". The Riesz representation theorem states that this mapping is an antilinear isomorphism. Thus to every element "φ" of the dual "H*" there exists one and only one "u"φ in "H" such that
for all "x" ∈ "H". The inner product on the dual space "H*" satisfies
The reversal of order on the right-hand side restores linearity in φ from the antilinearity of "u"φ. In the real case, the antilinear isomorphism from "H" to its dual is actually an isomorphism, and so real Hilbert spaces are naturally isomorphic to their own duals.
The representing vector "u"φ is obtained in the following way. When "φ" ≠ 0, the kernel "F" = Ker(φ) is a closed vector subspace of "H", not equal to "H", hence there exists a non-zero vector "v" orthogonal to "F". The vector "u" is a suitable scalar multiple "λv" of "v". The requirement that φ("v") = ⟨"v", "u"⟩ yields
This correspondence "φ" ↔ "u" is exploited by the bra-ket notation popular in physics. It is common in physics to assume that the inner product, denoted by ⟨"x"|"y"⟩, is linear on the right,
The result ⟨"x"|"y"⟩ can be seen as the action of the linear functional ⟨"x"| (the "bra") on the vector  |"y"⟩ (the "ket").
The Riesz representation theorem relies fundamentally not just on the presence of an inner product, but also on the completeness of the space. In fact, the theorem implies that the topological dual of any inner product space can be identified with its completion. An immediate consequence of the Riesz representation theorem is also that a Hilbert space "H" is reflexive, meaning that the natural map from "H" into its double dual space is an isomorphism.
Weakly convergent sequences.
In a Hilbert space "H", a sequence {"x""n"} is weakly convergent to a vector "x" ∈ "H" when
for every .
For example, any orthonormal sequence {"f""n"} converges weakly to 0, as a consequence of Bessel's inequality. Every weakly convergent sequence {"x""n"} is bounded, by the uniform boundedness principle.
Conversely, every bounded sequence in a Hilbert space admits weakly convergent subsequences (Alaoglu's theorem). This fact may be used to prove minimization results for continuous convex functionals, in the same way that the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem is used for continuous functions on R"d". Among several variants, one simple statement is as follows:
This fact (and its various generalizations) are fundamental for direct methods in the calculus of variations. Minimization results for convex functionals are also a direct consequence of the slightly more abstract fact that closed bounded convex subsets in a Hilbert space "H" are weakly compact, since "H" is reflexive. The existence of weakly convergent subsequences is a special case of the Eberlein–Šmulian theorem.
Banach space properties.
Any general property of Banach spaces continues to hold for Hilbert spaces. The open mapping theorem states that a continuous surjective linear transformation from one Banach space to another is an open mapping meaning that it sends open sets to open sets. A corollary is the bounded inverse theorem, that a continuous and bijective linear function from one Banach space to another is an isomorphism (that is, a continuous linear map whose inverse is also continuous). This theorem is considerably simpler to prove in the case of Hilbert spaces than in general Banach spaces. The open mapping theorem is equivalent to the closed graph theorem, which asserts that a function from one Banach space to another is continuous if and only if its graph is a closed set. In the case of Hilbert spaces, this is basic in the study of unbounded operators (see closed operator).
The (geometrical) Hahn–Banach theorem asserts that a closed convex set can be separated from any point outside it by means of a hyperplane of the Hilbert space. This is an immediate consequence of the best approximation property: if "y" is the element of a closed convex set "F" closest to "x", then the separating hyperplane is the plane perpendicular to the segment "xy" passing through its midpoint.
Operators on Hilbert spaces.
Bounded operators.
The continuous linear operators "A" : "H"1 → "H"2 from a Hilbert space "H"1 to a second Hilbert space "H"2 are "bounded" in the sense that they map bounded sets to bounded sets. Conversely, if an operator is bounded, then it is continuous. The space of such bounded linear operators has a norm, the operator norm given by
The sum and the composite of two bounded linear operators is again bounded and linear. For "y" in "H"2, the map that sends "x" ∈ "H"1 to ⟨"Ax", "y"⟩ is linear and continuous, and according to the Riesz representation theorem can therefore be represented in the form
for some vector "A*" "y" in "H"1. This defines another bounded linear operator "A*": "H"2 → "H"1, the adjoint of "A". One can see that .
The set B("H") of all bounded linear operators on "H", together with the addition and composition operations, the norm and the adjoint operation, is a C*-algebra, which is a type of operator algebra.
An element "A"  of B("H") is called "self-adjoint" or "Hermitian" if "A*"= "A". If "A"  is Hermitian and 0 for every "x", then "A"  is called "non-negative", written "A" ≥ 0; if equality holds only when "x" = 0, then "A"  is called "positive". The set of self adjoint operators admits a partial order, in which "A" ≥ "B" if "A" − "B" ≥ 0. If "A"  has the form "B*" "B"  for some "B", then "A" is non-negative; if "B" is invertible, then "A"  is positive. A converse is also true in the sense that, for a non-negative operator "A", there exists a unique non-negative square root "B" such that
In a sense made precise by the spectral theorem, self-adjoint operators can usefully be thought of as operators that are "real". An element "A" of B("H") is called "normal" if "A*" "A" = "A" "A*". Normal operators decompose into the sum of a self-adjoint operators and an imaginary multiple of a self adjoint operator
that commute with each other. Normal operators can also usefully be thought of in terms of their real and imaginary parts.
An element "U"  of B("H") is called unitary if "U"  is invertible and its inverse is given by "U*". This can also be expressed by requiring that "U"  be onto for all "x" and "y" in "H". The unitary operators form a group under composition, which is the isometry group of "H".
An element of B("H") is compact if it sends bounded sets to relatively compact sets. Equivalently, a bounded operator "T" is compact if, for any bounded sequence {"xk"}, the sequence {"Txk"} has a convergent subsequence. Many integral operators are compact, and in fact define a special class of operators known as Hilbert–Schmidt operators that are especially important in the study of integral equations. Fredholm operators differ from a compact operator by a multiple of the identity, and are equivalently characterized as operators with a finite dimensional kernel and cokernel. The index of a Fredholm operator "T" is defined by
The index is homotopy invariant, and plays a deep role in differential geometry via the Atiyah–Singer index theorem.
Unbounded operators.
Unbounded operators are also tractable in Hilbert spaces, and have important applications to quantum mechanics. An unbounded operator "T" on a Hilbert space "H" is defined as a linear operator whose domain "D"("T") is a linear subspace of "H". Often the domain "D"("T") is a dense subspace of "H", in which case "T" is known as a densely defined operator.
The adjoint of a densely defined unbounded operator is defined in essentially the same manner as for bounded operators. Self-adjoint unbounded operators play the role of the "observables" in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. Examples of self-adjoint unbounded operators on the Hilbert space "L"2(R) are:
These correspond to the momentum and position observables, respectively. Note that neither "A" nor "B" is defined on all of "H", since in the case of "A" the derivative need not exist, and in the case of "B" the product function need not be square integrable. In both cases, the set of possible arguments form dense subspaces of "L"2(R).
Constructions.
Direct sums.
Two Hilbert spaces "H"1 and "H"2 can be combined into another Hilbert space, called the (orthogonal) direct sum, and denoted
consisting of the set of all ordered pairs ("x"1, "x"2) where , , and inner product defined by
More generally, if "H""i" is a family of Hilbert spaces indexed by , then the direct sum of the "H""i", denoted
consists of the set of all indexed families
in the Cartesian product of the "H""i" such that
The inner product is defined by
Each of the "H""i" is included as a closed subspace in the direct sum of all of the "H""i". Moreover, the "H""i" are pairwise orthogonal. Conversely, if there is a system of closed subspaces, "V""i", , in a Hilbert space "H", that are pairwise orthogonal and whose union is dense in "H", then "H" is canonically isomorphic to the direct sum of "V""i". In this case, "H" is called the internal direct sum of the "V""i". A direct sum (internal or external) is also equipped with a family of orthogonal projections "E""i" onto the "i"th direct summand "H"i. These projections are bounded, self-adjoint, idempotent operators that satisfy the orthogonality condition
The spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space "H" states that "H" splits into an orthogonal direct sum of the eigenspaces of an operator, and also gives an explicit decomposition of the operator as a sum of projections onto the eigenspaces. The direct sum of Hilbert spaces also appears in quantum mechanics as the Fock space of a system containing a variable number of particles, where each Hilbert space in the direct sum corresponds to an additional degree of freedom for the quantum mechanical system. In representation theory, the Peter–Weyl theorem guarantees that any unitary representation of a compact group on a Hilbert space splits as the direct sum of finite-dimensional representations.
Tensor products.
If "H"1 and "H"2, then one defines an inner product on the (ordinary) tensor product as follows. On simple tensors, let
This formula then extends by sesquilinearity to an inner product on "H"1 ⊗ "H"2. The Hilbertian tensor product of "H"1 and "H"2, sometimes denoted by formula_84, is the Hilbert space obtained by completing "H"1 ⊗ "H"2 for the metric associated to this inner product.
An example is provided by the Hilbert space "L"2(The Hilbertian tensor product of two copies of "L"2([0, 1) is isometrically and linearly isomorphic to the space "L"2(of square-integrable functions on the square [0, 12. This isomorphism sends a simple tensor formula_85 to the function
on the square.
This example is typical in the following sense. Associated to every simple tensor product "x"1 ⊗ "x"2 is the rank one operator from "H"1∗ to "H"2 that maps a given formula_87 as
This mapping defined on simple tensors extends to a linear identification between "H"1 ⊗ "H"2 and the space of finite rank operators from "H*"1 to "H"2. This extends to a linear isometry of the Hilbertian tensor product formula_84 with the Hilbert space "HS"("H*"1, "H"2) of Hilbert–Schmidt operators from "H*"1 to "H"2.
Orthonormal bases.
The notion of an orthonormal basis from linear algebra generalizes over to the case of Hilbert spaces. In a Hilbert space "H", an orthonormal basis is a family {"e""k"} of elements of "H" satisfying the conditions:
A system of vectors satisfying the first two conditions basis is called an orthonormal system or an orthonormal set (or an orthonormal sequence if "B" is countable). Such a system is always linearly independent. Completeness of an orthonormal system of vectors of a Hilbert space can be equivalently restated as:
This is related to the fact that the only vector orthogonal to a dense linear subspace is the zero vector, for if "S" is any orthonormal set and "v" is orthogonal to "S", then "v" is orthogonal to the closure of the linear span of "S", which is the whole space.
Examples of orthonormal bases include:
In the infinite-dimensional case, an orthonormal basis will not be a basis in the sense of linear algebra; to distinguish the two, the latter basis is also called a Hamel basis. That the span of the basis vectors is dense implies that every vector in the space can be written as the sum of an infinite series, and the orthogonality implies that this decomposition is unique.
Sequence spaces.
The space "ℓ" 2 of square-summable sequences of complex numbers is the set of infinite sequences
of complex numbers such that
This space has an orthonormal basis:
More generally, if "B" is any set, then one can form a Hilbert space of sequences with index set "B", defined by
The summation over "B" is here defined by
the supremum being taken over all finite subsets of "B". It follows that, for this sum to be finite, every element of "ℓ" 2("B") has only countably many nonzero terms. This space becomes a Hilbert space with the inner product
for all "x" and "y" in "ℓ" 2("B"). Here the sum also has only countably many nonzero terms, and is unconditionally convergent by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.
An orthonormal basis of "ℓ" 2("B") is indexed by the set "B", given by
Bessel's inequality and Parseval's formula.
Let be a finite orthonormal system in "H". For an arbitrary vector "x" in "H", let
Then  = for every "k" = . It follows that is orthogonal to each "f""k", hence is orthogonal to "y". Using the Pythagorean identity twice, it follows that
Let , be an arbitrary orthonormal system in "H". Applying the preceding inequality to every finite subset "J" of "I" gives the "Bessel inequality"
(according to the definition of the sum of an arbitrary family of non-negative real numbers).
Geometrically, Bessel's inequality implies that the orthogonal projection of "x" onto the linear subspace spanned by the "f""i" has norm that does not exceed that of "x". In two dimensions, this is the assertion that the length of the leg of a right triangle may not exceed the length of the hypotenuse.
Bessel's inequality is a stepping stone to the more powerful Parseval identity, which governs the case when Bessel's inequality is actually an equality. If {"e""k"}"k" ∈ "B" is an orthonormal basis of "H", then every element "x" of "H" may be written as
Even if "B" is uncountable, Bessel's inequality guarantees that the expression is well-defined and consists only of countably many nonzero terms. This sum is called the "Fourier expansion" of "x", and the individual coefficients ⟨"x","e""k"⟩ are the "Fourier coefficients" of "x". Parseval's formula is then
Conversely, if {"e""k"} is an orthonormal set such that Parseval's identity holds for every "x", then {"e""k"} is an orthonormal basis.
Hilbert dimension.
As a consequence of Zorn's lemma, "every" Hilbert space admits an orthonormal basis; furthermore, any two orthonormal bases of the same space have the same cardinality, called the Hilbert dimension of the space. For instance, since "ℓ"2("B") has an orthonormal basis indexed by "B", its Hilbert dimension is the cardinality of "B" (which may be a finite integer, or a countable or uncountable cardinal number).
As a consequence of Parseval's identity, if {"e""k"}"k" ∈ "B" is an orthonormal basis of "H", then the map  ℓ2("B") defined by is an isometric isomorphism of Hilbert spaces: it is a bijective linear mapping such that
for all "x" and "y" in "H". The cardinal number of "B" is the Hilbert dimension of "H". Thus every Hilbert space is isometrically isomorphic to a sequence space  ℓ2("B") for some set "B".
Separable spaces.
A Hilbert space is separable if and only if it admits a countable orthonormal basis. All infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces are therefore isometrically isomorphic to "ℓ"2.
In the past, Hilbert spaces were often required to be separable as part of the definition. Most spaces used in physics are separable, and since these are all isomorphic to each other, one often refers to any infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space as ""the" Hilbert space" or just "Hilbert space". Even in quantum field theory, most of the Hilbert spaces are in fact separable, as stipulated by the Wightman axioms. However, it is sometimes argued that non-separable Hilbert spaces are also important in quantum field theory, roughly because the systems in the theory possess an infinite number of degrees of freedom and any infinite Hilbert tensor product (of spaces of dimension greater than one) is non-separable. For instance, a bosonic field can be naturally thought of as an element of a tensor product whose factors represent harmonic oscillators at each point of space. From this perspective, the natural state space of a boson might seem to be a non-separable space. However, it is only a small separable subspace of the full tensor product that can contain physically meaningful fields (on which the observables can be defined). Another non-separable Hilbert space models the state of an infinite collection of particles in an unbounded region of space. An orthonormal basis of the space is indexed by the density of the particles, a continuous parameter, and since the set of possible densities is uncountable, the basis is not countable.
Orthogonal complements and projections.
If "S" is a subset of a Hilbert space "H", the set of vectors orthogonal to "S" is defined by
"S"⊥ is a closed subspace of "H" (can be proved easily using the linearity and continuity of the inner product) and so forms itself a Hilbert space. If "V" is a closed subspace of "H", then "V"⊥ is called the "orthogonal complement" of "V". In fact, every "x" in "H" can then be written uniquely as "x" = "v" + "w", with "v" in "V" and "w" in "V"⊥. Therefore, "H" is the internal Hilbert direct sum of "V" and "V"⊥.
The linear operator P"V" : "H" → "H" that maps "x" to "v" is called the "orthogonal projection" onto "V". There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the set of all closed subspaces of "H" and the set of all bounded self-adjoint operators "P" such that "P"2 = "P". Specifically,
This provides the geometrical interpretation of "PV"("x"): it is the best approximation to "x" by elements of "V".
Projections "PU" and "PV" are called mutually orthogonal if "P""U""P""V" = 0. This is equivalent to "U" and "V" being orthogonal as subspaces of "H". The sum of the two projections "P""U" and "P""V" is a projection only if "U" and "V" are orthogonal to each other, and in that case "P""U" + "P""V" = "P""U"+"V". The composite "P""U""P""V" is generally not a projection; in fact, the composite is a projection if and only if the two projections commute, and in that case "P""U""P""V" = "P""U"∩"V".
By restricting the codomain to the Hilbert space "V", the orthogonal projection "P""V" gives rise to a projection mapping π: "H" → "V"; it is the adjoint of the inclusion mapping
meaning that
for all "x" ∈ "V" and "y" ∈ "H".
The operator norm of the orthogonal projection "P""V" onto a non-zero closed subspace "V" is equal to one:
Every closed subspace "V" of a Hilbert space is therefore the image of an operator "P" of norm one such that "P"2 = "P". The property of possessing appropriate projection operators characterizes Hilbert spaces:
While this result characterizes the metric structure of a Hilbert space, the structure of a Hilbert space as a topological vector space can itself be characterized in terms of the presence of complementary subspaces:
The orthogonal complement satisfies some more elementary results. It is a monotone function in the sense that if "U" ⊂ "V", then formula_108 with equality holding if and only if "V" is contained in the closure of "U". This result is a special case of the Hahn–Banach theorem. The closure of a subspace can be completely characterized in terms of the orthogonal complement: If "V" is a subspace of "H", then the closure of "V" is equal to formula_109. The orthogonal complement is thus a Galois connection on the partial order of subspaces of a Hilbert space. In general, the orthogonal complement of a sum of subspaces is the intersection of the orthogonal complements: formula_110. If the "V""i" are in addition closed, then formula_111.
Spectral theory.
There is a well-developed spectral theory for self-adjoint operators in a Hilbert space, that is roughly analogous to the study of symmetric matrices over the reals or self-adjoint matrices over the complex numbers. In the same sense, one can obtain a "diagonalization" of a self-adjoint operator as a suitable sum (actually an integral) of orthogonal projection operators.
The spectrum of an operator "T", denoted σ("T") is the set of complex numbers λ such that "T" − λ lacks a continuous inverse. If "T" is bounded, then the spectrum is always a compact set in the complex plane, and lies inside the disc formula_112 If "T" is self-adjoint, then the spectrum is real. In fact, it is contained in the interval ["m","M"] where
Moreover, "m" and "M" are both actually contained within the spectrum.
The eigenspaces of an operator "T" are given by
Unlike with finite matrices, not every element of the spectrum of "T" must be an eigenvalue: the linear operator "T" − λ may only lack an inverse because it is not surjective. Elements of the spectrum of an operator in the general sense are known as "spectral values". Since spectral values need not be eigenvalues, the spectral decomposition is often more subtle than in finite dimensions.
However, the spectral theorem of a self-adjoint operator "T" takes a particularly simple form if, in addition, "T" is assumed to be a compact operator. The spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators states:
This theorem plays a fundamental role in the theory of integral equations, as many integral operators are compact, in particular those that arise from Hilbert–Schmidt operators.
The general spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators involves a kind of operator-valued Riemann–Stieltjes integral, rather than an infinite summation. The "spectral family" associated to "T" associates to each real number λ an operator "E"λ, which is the projection onto the nullspace of the operator ("T" − λ)+, where the positive part of a self-adjoint operator is defined by
The operators "E"λ are monotone increasing relative to the partial order defined on self-adjoint operators; the eigenvalues correspond precisely to the jump discontinuities. One has the spectral theorem, which asserts
The integral is understood as a Riemann–Stieltjes integral, convergent with respect to the norm on B("H"). In particular, one has the ordinary scalar-valued integral representation
A somewhat similar spectral decomposition holds for normal operators, although because the spectrum may now contain non-real complex numbers, the operator-valued Stieltjes measure "dE"λ must instead be replaced by a resolution of the identity.
A major application of spectral methods is the spectral mapping theorem, which allows one to apply to a self-adjoint operator "T" any continuous complex function "f" defined on the spectrum of "T" by forming the integral
The resulting continuous functional calculus has applications in particular to pseudodifferential operators.
The spectral theory of "unbounded" self-adjoint operators is only marginally more difficult than for bounded operators. The spectrum of an unbounded operator is defined in precisely the same way as for bounded operators: λ is a spectral value if the resolvent operator
fails to be a well-defined continuous operator. The self-adjointness of "T" still guarantees that the spectrum is real. Thus the essential idea of working with unbounded operators is to look instead at the resolvent "R"λ where λ is non-real. This is a "bounded" normal operator, which admits a spectral representation that can then be transferred to a spectral representation of "T" itself. A similar strategy is used, for instance, to study the spectrum of the Laplace operator: rather than address the operator directly, one instead looks as an associated resolvent such as a Riesz potential or Bessel potential.
A precise version of the spectral theorem in this case is:
There is also a version of the spectral theorem that applies to unbounded normal operators.

Vichy France

Vichy France, officially the French State ("l'État français"), was France during the regime of Marshal Philippe Pétain, during World War II, from the German victory in the Battle of France (July 1940) to the Allied liberation in August 1944. Following the defeat in June 1940, President Albert Lebrun appointed Marshal Pétain as premier. After making peace with Germany, Pétain and his government voted to reorganize the discredited Third Republic into an authoritarian regime.
The newly formed French State maintained nominal sovereignty over the whole of French territory as defined by the Second Armistice at Compiègne. However, Vichy maintained full sovereignty only in the unoccupied southern "Zone libre" ("free zone"), while retaining limited authority in the "Wehrmacht"-occupied northern zone, the "Zone occupée" ("occupied zone"). The occupation was to be a provisional state of affairs pending the conclusion of the war in the west, which at the time appeared imminent. In November 1942, however, the "Zone libre" was also occupied, with Germany closely supervising all French officials.
Marshal Pétain collaborated with the German occupying forces in exchange for an agreement not to divide France between the Axis powers. Germany kept two million French soldiers in Germany as forced laborers to enforce its terms. Vichy authorities aided in the rounding-up of Jews and other "undesirables". At times in the colonies Vichy French military forces actively opposed the Allies. Much of the French public initially supported the new government despite its pro-Nazi policies, often seeing it as necessary to maintain a degree of French autonomy and territorial integrity. 
The legitimacy of Vichy France and Pétain's leadership was constantly challenged by the exiled General Charles de Gaulle, based in London, who claimed to represent the legitimacy and continuity of the French nation. The overseas French colonies were originally under Vichy control, but it lost one after another to de Gaulle's Free French movement. Public opinion turned against the Vichy regime and the occupying German forces over time and resistance to them increased. Following the Allied invasion of France in June 1944, de Gaulle proclaimed the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF).
Following France's liberation in summer 1944, most of the Vichy regime's leaders fled or were put on trial by the GPRF and a number were executed for treason. Thousands of collaborators were killed without trial by local Resistance forces. Pétain was sentenced to death for treason, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Only four senior Vichy officials were tried for crimes against humanity, although many more had participated in the deportation of Jews for extermination in concentration camps, abuses of prisoners and severe acts against members of the Resistance.
Overview.
Vichy France was established after France surrendered to Germany on 22 June 1940, and took its name from the government's administrative centre of Vichy, in central France. Paris remained the official capital, to which Pétain always intended to return the government when this became possible.
In 1940, Marshal Pétain was known mainly as a World War One hero, the victor of Verdun. As last Prime Minister of the Third Republic, Pétain, a reactionary by inclination, blamed the Third Republic's democracy for France's quick defeat. He set up a paternalistic, semi-fascist regime that actively collaborated with Germany, its official neutrality notwithstanding. The Vichy government cooperated with the Nazis' racial policies.
It is a common misconception that the Vichy Regime administered only the unoccupied zone of southern France (named "free zone" ["zone libre"] by Vichy), while the Germans directly administered the occupied zone. In theory, the civil jurisdiction of the Vichy government extended over most of metropolitan France; only the disputed border territory of Alsace-Lorraine was placed under direct German administration. Similarly, a sliver of French territory in the Alps was under direct Italian administration from June 1940 to September 1943. Throughout the rest of the country, civil servants were under the authority of French ministers in Vichy. René Bousquet, the head of French police nominated by Vichy, exercised his power directly in Paris through his second-in-command, Jean Leguay, who coordinated raids with the Nazis. German laws, however, took precedence over French ones in the occupied territories, and the Germans often rode roughshod over the sensibilities of Vichy administrators.
On 11 November 1942, the Germans launched Operation Anton, occupying southern France, following the landing of the Allies in North Africa (Operation Torch). Although Vichy's "Armistice Army" was disbanded, thus diminishing Vichy's independence, the abolition of the line of demarcation in March 1943 made civil administration easier. Vichy continued to exercise jurisdiction over almost all of France until the collapse of the regime following the Allied invasion in June 1944.
Until 23 October 1944, the Vichy Regime was acknowledged as the official government of France by the United States and other countries, including Canada, which were at the same time at war with Germany. The United Kingdom maintained unofficial contacts with Vichy, at least until it became apparent that the Vichy Prime Minister, Pierre Laval, intended full collaboration with the Germans. Even after that it maintained an ambivalent attitude towards the alternative Free French movement and future government.
The Vichy government's claim that it was the "de jure" French government was challenged by the Free French Forces of Charles de Gaulle (based first in London and later in Algiers) and subsequent French governments. They continuously held that the Vichy Regime was an illegal government run by traitors. Historians have particularly debated the circumstances of the vote granting full powers to Pétain on 10 July 1940. The main arguments advanced against Vichy's right to incarnate the continuity of the French State were based on the pressure exerted by Laval on deputies in Vichy, and on the absence of 27 deputies and senators who had fled on the ship "Massilia", and could thus not take part in the vote.
Ideology.
Vichy sought an anti-modern counter-revolution. The Right in France, with strength in the aristocracy and among Catholics, had never accepted the republican traditions of the French Revolution. It demanded a return to traditional lines culture and religion and embraced authoritarianism while dismissing democracy. The Communist element, strongest in labour unions, turned against the regime in June 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Vichy was intensely anti-Communist and generally pro-Nazi; Payne finds that it, "was distinctly rightist and authoritarian but never fascist." Paxton analyzes the entire range of Vichy supporters, from reactionaries to moderate liberal modernizers, and concludes that genuine fascist elements had but minor roles in most sectors.
The regime tried to assert its legitimacy by symbolically connecting itself to the Gallo-Roman period of France's history, and celebrated the Gaul chieftain Vercingetorix as the "founder" of the nation. it was maintained that as the defeat of the Gauls in the Battle of Alesia had been the moment in French history when a sense of common nationhood was born, the defeat of 1940 would again unify the nation. The regime's "Francisque" insignia featured two symbols from the Gallic period: the baton and the double-headed hatchet (labrys) arranged so as to resemble the fasces, symbol of the Italian Fascists.
Fall of France and establishment of the Vichy Regime.
France declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939 following the German invasion of Poland, which took place two days prior. After the eight-month Phoney War, the Germans launched their offensive in the west on 10 May 1940. Within days, it became clear that French forces were overwhelmed and that military collapse was imminent. Government and military leaders, deeply shocked by the débâcle, debated how to proceed. Many officials, including Prime Minister Paul Reynaud, wanted to move the government to French territories in North Africa, and continue the war with the French Navy and colonial resources. Others, particularly the Vice-Premier Philippe Pétain and the Commander-in-Chief, General Maxime Weygand, insisted that the responsibility of the government was to remain in France and share the misfortune of its people. The latter view called for an immediate cessation of hostilities.
While this debate continued, the government was forced to relocate several times, finally reaching Bordeaux, to avoid capture by advancing German forces. Communications were poor and thousands of civilian refugees clogged the roads. In these chaotic conditions, advocates of an armistice gained the upper hand. The Cabinet agreed on a proposal to seek armistice terms from Germany, with the understanding that, should Germany set forth dishonourable or excessively harsh terms, France would retain the option to continue to fight. General Charles Huntziger, who headed the French armistice delegation, was told to break off negotiations if the Germans demanded the occupation of all metropolitan France, the French fleet or any of the French overseas territories. They did not.
Prime Minister Paul Reynaud was in favor of continuing the war, from North Africa if necessary; however, he was soon outvoted by those who advocated surrender. Facing an untenable situation, Reynaud resigned and, on his recommendation, President Albert Lebrun appointed the 84-year-old Pétain as his replacement on 16 June. The Armistice with France (Second Compiègne) agreement was signed on 22 June. A separate agreement was reached with Italy, which had entered the war against France on 10 June, well after the outcome of the battle was decided.
Adolf Hitler had a number of reasons for agreeing to an armistice. He wanted to ensure that France did not continue to fight from North Africa, and he wanted to ensure that the French Navy was taken out of the war. In addition, leaving a French government in place would relieve Germany of the considerable burden of administering French territory, particularly as he turned his attentions toward Britain. Finally, as Germany lacked a navy sufficient to occupy France's overseas territories, Hitler's only practical recourse to deny the British use of them was to maintain France's status as a supposedly independent and neutral nation.
Conditions of armistice and 10 July 1940 vote of full powers.
The armistice divided France into occupied and unoccupied zones: northern and western France including the entire Atlantic coast were occupied by Germany, and the remaining two-fifths of the country were under the control of the French government with the capital at Vichy under Pétain. Ostensibly, the French government administered the entire territory.
Prisoners.
Germany took two million French soldiers as prisoners of war and sent them to camps in Germany. About one third were released on various terms by 1944. Of the remainder, the officers and NCOs (corporals and sergeants) were kept in camps and did not work. The privates were sent first to "Stalag" camps for processing and then were put out to work. About half of them worked in German agriculture, where food supplies were adequate and controls were lenient. The others worked in factories or mines, where conditions were much harsher.
Army of the Armistice.
The Germans preferred to occupy northern France themselves. The French had to pay costs for the 300,000-strong German occupation army, amounting to 20 million Reichmarks per day, paid at the artificial rate of twenty francs to the Mark. This was 50 times the actual costs of the occupation garrison. The French government also had responsibility for preventing citizens from escaping into exile.
Article IV of the Armistice allowed for a small French army—the Army of the Armistice ("Armée de l'Armistice")—stationed in the unoccupied zone, and for the military provision of the French colonial empire overseas. The function of these forces was to keep internal order and to defend French territories from Allied assault. The French forces were to remain under the overall direction of the German armed forces.
The exact strength of the Vichy French Metropolitan Army was set at 3,768 officers, 15,072 non-commissioned officers, and 75,360 men. All members had to be volunteers. In addition to the army, the size of the "Gendarmerie" was fixed at 60,000 men plus an anti-aircraft force of 10,000 men. Despite the influx of trained soldiers from the colonial forces (reduced in size in accordance with the Armistice), there was a shortage of volunteers. As a result, 30,000 men of the "class of 1939" were retained to fill the quota. At the beginning of 1942 these conscripts were released, but there was still an insufficient number of men. This shortage would remain until the dissolution, despite Vichy appeals to the Germans for a regular form of conscription.
The Vichy French Metropolitan Army was deprived of tanks and other armored vehicles, and was desperately short of motorized transport, a particular problem for cavalry units. Surviving recruiting posters stress the opportunities for athletic activities, including horsemanship – which reflects both the general emphasis placed by the Vichy regime on rural virtues and outdoor activities, and the realities of service in a small and technologically backward military force. Traditional features characteristic of the pre-1940 French Army, such as kepis and heavy capotes (buttoned-back greatcoats), were replaced by berets and simplified uniforms.
The Vichy authorities did not deploy the Army of the Armistice against resistance groups active in the south of France, reserving this role to the Vichy "Milice" (militia).
Members of the regular army were therefore able to defect in significant numbers to the "Maquis", following the German occupation of southern France and the disbandment of the Army of the Armistice in November 1942. By contrast, the Milice continued to collaborate and its members became subject to reprisals after the Liberation.
Vichy French colonial forces were reduced in accordance with the terms of the Armistice; still, in the Mediterranean area alone, the Vichy French had nearly 150,000 men in arms. There were approximately 55,000 in French Morocco, 50,000 in Algeria, and almost 40,000 in the "Army of the Levant" ("Armée du Levant"), in Lebanon and Syria. Colonial forces were allowed to keep some armored vehicles, though these were mostly "vintage" tanks as old as the World War I-era Renault FT.
German custody.
France was required to turn over any German citizens within the country whom the Germans demanded custody of. The French thought this to be a "dishonourable" term, since it would require France to hand over persons who had entered France seeking refuge from Germany. Attempts to negotiate the point with Germany were unsuccessful, and the French decided not to press the issue to the point of refusing the Armistice, though they may have hoped to ameliorate the requirement in future negotiations with Germany after the signing.
Vichy government.
On 1 July 1940, the Parliament and the government gathered in the quiet spa town of Vichy, their provisional capital in central France. (Lyon, France's second-largest city, would have been a more logical choice but mayor Édouard Herriot was too associated with the Third Republic. Marseilles had a reputation as the dangerous "Chicago" of France. Toulouse was too remote and had a left-wing reputation. Vichy was centrally located and had many hotels for ministers to stay at.) Laval and Raphaël Alibert began their campaign to convince the assembled Senators and Deputies to vote full powers to Pétain. They used every means available, promising ministerial posts to some while threatening and intimidating others. They were aided by the absence of popular, charismatic figures who might have opposed them, such as Georges Mandel and Édouard Daladier, then aboard the ship "Massilia" on their way to North Africa and exile. On 10 July the National Assembly, comprising both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, voted by 569 votes to 80, with 20 voluntary abstentions, to grant full and extraordinary powers to Marshal Pétain. By the same vote, they also granted him the power to write a new constitution.
Most legislators believed that democracy would continue, albeit with a new constitution. Although Laval said on 6 July that "parliamentary democracy has lost the war; it must disappear, ceding its place to an authoritarian, hierarchical, national and social regime", the majority trusted in Pétain. Léon Blum, who voted no, wrote three months later that Laval's "obvious objective was to cut all the roots that bound France to its republican and revolutionary past. His 'national revolution' was to be a counterrevolution eliminating all the progress and human rights won in the last one hundred and fifty years". The minority of mostly Radicals and Socialists who opposed Laval became known as the Vichy 80. Deputies and senators who voted to grant full powers to Pétain were condemned on an individual basis after the liberation.
The majority of French historians and all post-war French governments contend this vote was illegal. Three main arguments are put forward:
Julian T. Jackson wrote, however, that "There seems little doubt, therefore, that at the beginning Vichy was both legal and legitimate." He stated that if legitimacy comes from popular support, Pétain's massive popularity in France until 1942 made his government legitimate; if legitimacy comes from diplomatic recognition, over 40 countries including the United States, Canada, and China recognized the Vichy government. According to Jackson, de Gaulle's Free French acknowledged the weakness of its case against Vichy's illegality by citing multiple dates (16 June 23 June, and 10 July) for the start of its illegitimate rule. Nations recognized the Vichy government despite de Gaulle's attempts in London to dissuade them; only the German occupation of all of France in November 1942 ended diplomatic recognition. Partisans of the Vichy point out that the revision was voted by the two chambers (the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies), in conformity with the law.
The argument concerning the abrogation of procedure is based on the absence and non-voluntary abstention of 176 representatives of the people – the 27 on board the "Massilia", and an additional 92 deputies and 57 senators, some of whom were in Vichy, but not present for the vote. In total, the parliament was composed of 846 members, 544 Deputies and 302 Senators. One Senator and 26 Deputies were on the "Massilia". One Senator did not vote. 8 Senators and 12 Deputies voluntarily abstained. 57 Senators and 92 Deputies involuntarily abstained. Thus, out of a total of 544 Deputies, only 414 voted; and out of a total of 302 Senators, only 235 voted. Of these, 357 Deputies voted in favor of Pétain and 57 against, while 212 Senators voted for Pétain, and 23 against. Although Pétain could claim for himself legality – particularly in comparison with the essentially self-appointed leadership of Charles de Gaulle – the dubious circumstances of the vote explain why a majority of French historians do not consider Vichy a complete continuity of the French state.
The text voted by the Congress stated:
The National Assembly gives full powers to the government of the Republic, under the authority and the signature of Marshall Pétain, to the effect of promulgating by one or several acts a new constitution of the French state. This constitution must guarantee the rights of labor, of family and of the fatherland. It will be ratified by the nation and applied by the assemblies which it has created.
The Constitutional Acts of 11 and 12 July 1940 granted to Pétain all powers (legislative, judicial, administrative, executive – and diplomatic) and the title of "head of the French state" ("chef de l'État français"), as well as the right to nominate his successor. On 12 July Pétain designated Laval as Vice-President and his designated successor, and appointed Fernand de Brinon as representative to the German High Command in Paris. Pétain remained the head of the Vichy regime until 20 August 1944. The French national motto, "Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité" (Freedom, Equality, Brotherhood), was replaced by "Travail, Famille, Patrie" (Work, Family, Fatherland); it was noted at the time that TFP also stood for the criminal punishment of ""travaux forcés à perpetuité"" ("forced labor in perpetuity"). Reynaud was arrested in September 1940 by the Vichy government and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1941 before the opening of the Riom Trial.
Pétain was reactionary by nature, his status as a hero of the Third Republic notwithstanding. Almost as soon as he was granted full powers, Pétain began blaming the Third Republic's democracy and endemic corruption for France's humiliating defeat. Accordingly, his regime soon began taking on authoritarian—and in some cases, overtly fascist—characteristics. Democratic liberties and guarantees were immediately suspended. The crime of "felony of opinion" ("délit d'opinion") was re-established, effectively repealing freedom of thought and of expression; critics were frequently arrested. Elective bodies were replaced by nominated ones. The "municipalities" and the departmental commissions were thus placed under the authority of the administration and of the prefects (nominated by and dependent on the executive power). In January 1941 the National Council ("Conseil National"), composed of notables from the countryside and the provinces, was instituted under the same conditions. Despite the clear authoritarian cast of Pétain's regime, he did not formally institute a one-party state, maintained the Tricolor and other symbols of republican France, and unlike many far rightists was not an anti-Dreyfusard.
State collaboration with Germany.
Historians distinguish between state collaboration followed by the Vichy regime, and "collaborationists", private French citizens eager to collaborate with Germany and who pushed towards a radicalization of the regime. ""Pétainistes"", on the other hand, refers to direct supporters of Marshal Pétain rather than Germany (although accepting Pétain's state collaboration). State collaboration was illustrated by the Montoire (Loir-et-Cher) interview in Hitler's train on 24 October 1940, during which Pétain and Hitler shook hands and agreed on this cooperation between the two states. Organized by Laval, a strong proponent of collaboration, the interview and the handshake were photographed and exploited by Nazi propaganda to gain support from the civilian population. On 30 October 1940, Pétain officialized state collaboration, declaring on the radio: "I enter today on the path of collaboration..." On 22 June 1942 Laval declared that he was "hoping for the victory of Germany." The sincere desire to collaborate did not stop the Vichy government from organising the arrest and even sometimes the execution of German spies entering the Vichy zone, as Simon Kitson's recent research has demonstrated.
The composition and policies of the Vichy cabinet were mixed. Many Vichy officials, such as Pétain, were reactionaries who felt that France's unfortunate fate was a result of its republican character and the actions of its left-wing governments of the 1930s, in particular of the Popular Front (1936–1938) led by Léon Blum. Charles Maurras, a monarchist writer and founder of the "Action Française" movement, judged that Pétain's accession to power was, in that respect, a "divine surprise", and many people of his persuasion believed it preferable to have an authoritarian government similar to that of Francisco Franco's Spain, even if under Germany's yoke, than to have a republican government. Others, like Joseph Darnand, were strong anti-Semites and overt Nazi sympathizers. A number of these joined the units of the "Légion des Volontaires Français contre le Bolchévisme" (Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism) fighting on the Eastern Front, later becoming the SS Charlemagne Division.
On the other hand, technocrats such as Jean Bichelonne or engineers from the "Groupe X-Crise" used their position to push various state, administrative and economic reforms. These reforms would be one of the strongest elements arguing in favor of the thesis of a continuity of the French administration before and after the war. Many of these civil servants and the reforms they advocated were retained after the war. Just as the necessities of a war economy during the First World War had pushed forward state measures to reorganize the economy of France against the prevailing classical liberal theories – structures retained after the 1919 Treaty of Versailles – reforms adopted during World War II were kept and extended. Along with 15 March 1944 Charter of the "Conseil National de la Résistance" (CNR), which gathered all Resistance movements under one unified political body, these reforms were a primary instrument in the establishment of post-war "dirigisme", a kind of semi-planned economy which led to France becoming the modern social democracy it is now. Examples of such continuities include the creation of the "French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems" by Alexis Carrel, a renowned physician who also supported eugenics. This institution would be renamed National Institute of Demographic Studies (INED) after the war, and exists to this day. Another example is the creation of the national statistics institute, renamed INSEE after the Liberation. The reorganization and unification of the French police by René Bousquet, who created the "groupes mobiles de réserve" (GMR, Reserve Mobile Groups), is another example of Vichy policy reform and restructuring maintained by subsequent governments. A national paramilitary police force, the GMR was occasionally used in actions against the French Resistance, but its main purpose was to enforce Vichy authority through intimidation and repression of the civilian population. After Liberation, some of its units would be merged with the Free French Army to form the "Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité" (CRS, Republican Security Companies), France's main anti-riot force.
Vichy's racial policies and collaboration.
Germany interfered little in internal French affairs for the first two years after the armistice, as long as public order was maintained. As soon as it was established, Pétain's government voluntarily took measures against the undesirables: Jews, "métèques" (immigrants from Mediterranean countries), Freemasons, Communists, Gypsies, homosexuals, and left-wing activists. Inspired by Charles Maurras' conception of the "Anti-France" (which he defined as the "four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, Freemasons and foreigners"), Vichy persecuted these supposed enemies.
In July 1940, Vichy set up a special Commission charged with reviewing naturalizations granted since the 1927 reform of the nationality law. Between June 1940 and August 1944, 15,000 persons, mostly Jews, were denaturalized. This bureaucratic decision was instrumental in their subsequent internment.
The internment camps already opened by the Third Republic were immediately put to new use, ultimately becoming transit camps for the implementation of the Holocaust and the extermination of all "undesirables", including the Romani people (who refer to the extermination of Gypsies as Porrajmos). A law of 4 October 1940 authorized internments of foreign Jews on the sole basis of a prefectoral order, and the first raids took place in May 1941. Vichy imposed no restrictions on black people in the Unoccupied Zone; the regime even had a mulatto cabinet minister, the Martinique-born lawyer Henry Lemery.
The Third Republic had first opened concentration camps during World War I for the internment of enemy aliens, and later used them for other purposes. Camp Gurs, for example, had been set up in southwestern France after the fall of Spanish Catalonia, in the first months of 1939, during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), to receive the Republican refugees, including Brigadists from all nations, fleeing the Francists. After Édouard Daladier's government (April 1938 – March 1940) took the decision to outlaw the French Communist Party (PCF) following the German-Soviet non-aggression pact (aka Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) signed in August 1939, these camps were also used to intern French communists. Drancy internment camp was founded in 1939 for this use; it later became the central transit camp through which all deportees passed on their way to concentration and extermination camps in the Third Reich and in Eastern Europe. When the Phoney War started with France's declaration of war against Germany on 3 September 1939, these camps were used to intern enemy aliens. These included German Jews and anti-fascists, but any German citizen (or Italian, Austrian, Polish, etc.) could also be interned in Camp Gurs and others. As the "Wehrmacht" advanced into Northern France, common prisoners evacuated from prisons were also interned in these camps. Camp Gurs received its first contingent of political prisoners in June 1940. It included left-wing activists (communists, anarchists, trade-unionists, anti-militarists, etc.) and pacifists, but also French fascists who supported the victory of Italy and Germany. Finally, after Pétain's proclamation of the "French state" and the beginning of the implementation of the ""Révolution nationale"" ("National Revolution"), the French administration opened up many concentration camps, to the point that, as historian Maurice Rajsfus wrote: "The quick opening of new camps created employment, and the Gendarmerie never ceased to hire during this period."
Besides the political prisoners already detained there, Gurs was then used to intern foreign Jews, stateless persons, Gypsies, homosexuals, and prostitutes. Vichy opened its first internment camp in the northern zone on 5 October 1940, in Aincourt, in the Seine-et-Oise department, which it quickly filled with PCF members. The Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans, in the Doubs, was used to intern Gypsies. The Camp des Milles, near Aix-en-Provence, was the largest internment camp in the Southeast of France; 2,500 Jews were deported from there following the August 1942 raids. Exiled Republican, antifascist Spaniards who had sought refuge in France after the recent victory in Spain of Franco's nationalist side, were then deported, and 5,000 of them died in Mauthausen concentration camp. In contrast, the French colonial soldiers were interned by the Germans on French territory instead of being deported.
Besides the concentration camps opened by Vichy, the Germans also opened some Ilags ("Internierungslager"), for the detainment enemy aliens, on French territory; in Alsace, which was under the direct administration of the Reich, they opened the Natzweiler camp, which was the only concentration camp created by the Nazis on French territory. Natzweiler included a gas chamber which was used to exterminate at least 86 detainees (mostly Jewish) with the aim obtaining a collection of undamaged skeletons (as this mode of execution did no damage to the skeletons themselves) for the use of Nazi professor August Hirt.
The Vichy government enacted a number of racial laws. In August 1940, laws against antisemitism in the media (the Marchandeau Act) were repealed, while the decree n°1775 September 5, 1943, denaturalized a number of French citizen], in particular Jews from Eastern Europe. Foreigners were rounded-up in "Foreign Workers Groups" ("groupements de travailleurs étrangers") and, as with the colonial troops, used by the Germans as manpower. The Statute on Jews excluded them from the civil administration.
Vichy also enacted racial laws in its French territories in North Africa (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia).
"The history of the Holocaust in France's three North African colonies (Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia) is intrinsically tied to France's fate during this period."
With regard to economic contribution to the German economy it is estimated that France provided 42% of the total foreign aid.
Eugenics policies.
In 1941, Nobel Prize winner Alexis Carrel, an early proponent of eugenics and euthanasia, and a member of Jacques Doriot's French Popular Party (PPF), advocated for the creation of the "Fondation Française pour l'Étude des Problèmes Humains" (French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems), using connections to the Pétain cabinet. Charged with the "study, in all of its aspects, of measures aimed at safeguarding, improving and developing the French population in all of its activities", the Foundation was created by decree of the collaborationist Vichy regime in 1941, and Carrel appointed as 'regent'. The Foundation also had for some time as general secretary François Perroux.
The Foundation was behind 16 December 1942 Act mandating the "prenuptial certificate", which required all couples seeking marriage to submit to a biological examination, to insure the "good health" of the spouses, in particular with regard to sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and "life hygiene". Carrel's institute also conceived the "scholar booklet" (""livret scolaire""), which could be used to record students' grades in French secondary schools, and thus classify and select them according to scholastic performance. Besides these eugenic activities aimed at classifying the population and improving its health, the Foundation also supported 11 October 1946 law instituting occupational medicine, enacted by the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF) after the Liberation.
The Foundation initiated studies on demographics (Robert Gessain, Paul Vincent, Jean Bourgeois), nutrition (Jean Sutter), and housing (Jean Merlet), as well as the first polls (Jean Stoetzel). The foundation, which after the war became the INED demographics institute, employed 300 researchers from the summer of 1942 to the end of the autumn of 1944. "The foundation was chartered as a public institution under the joint supervision of the ministries of finance and public health. It was given financial autonomy and a budget of forty million francs, roughly one franc per inhabitant: a true luxury considering the burdens imposed by the German Occupation on the nation's resources. By way of comparison, the whole Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) was given a budget of fifty million francs."
Alexis Carrel had previously published in 1935 the best-selling book "L'Homme, cet inconnu" ("Man, This Unknown"). Since the early 1930s, Carrel had advocated the use of gas chambers to rid humanity of its "inferior stock", endorsing the scientific racism discourse. One of the founders of these pseudoscientifical theories had been Arthur de Gobineau in his 1853–1855 essay titled "An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races". In the 1936 preface to the German edition of his book, Alexis Carrel had added a praise to the eugenics policies of the Third Reich, writing that:
(t)he German government has taken energetic measures against the propagation of the defective, the mentally diseased, and the criminal. The ideal solution would be the suppression of each of these individuals as soon as he has proven himself to be dangerous.
Carrel also wrote in his book that:
(t)he conditioning of petty criminals with the whip, or some more scientific procedure, followed by a short stay in hospital, would probably suffice to insure order. Those who have murdered, robbed while armed with automatic pistol or machine gun, kidnapped children, despoiled the poor of their savings, misled the public in important matters, should be humanely and economically disposed of in small euthanasic institutions supplied with proper gasses. A similar treatment could be advantageously applied to the insane, guilty of criminal acts.
Alexis Carrel had also taken an active part to a symposium in Pontigny organized by Jean Coutrot, the ""Entretiens de Pontigny"". Scholars such as Lucien Bonnafé, Patrick Tort and Max Lafont have accused Carrel of responsibility for the execution of thousands of mentally ill or impaired patients under Vichy.
Statute on Jews.
A Nazi ordinance dated 21 September 1940, forced Jews of the "occupied zone" to declare themselves as such at a police station or sub-prefectures ("sous-préfectures"). Under the responsibility of André Tulard, head of the Service on Foreign Persons and Jewish Questions at the Prefecture of Police of Paris, a filing system registering Jewish people was created. Tulard had previously created such a filing system under the Third Republic, registering members of the Communist Party (PCF). In the department of the Seine, encompassing Paris and its immediate suburbs, nearly 150,000 persons, unaware of the upcoming danger and assisted by the police, presented themselves at police stations in accordance with the military order. The registered information was then centralized by the French police, who constructed, under the direction of inspector Tulard, a central filing system. According to the Dannecker report, "this filing system is subdivided into files alphabetically classed, Jewish with French nationality and foreign Jewish having files of different colours, and the files were also classed, according to profession, nationality and street residency"). These files were then handed over to Theodor Dannecker, head of the "Gestapo" in France, under the orders of Adolf Eichmann, head of the RSHA IV-D. They were used by the Gestapo on various raids, among them the August 1941 raid in the 11th arrondissement of Paris, which resulted in 3,200 foreign and 1,000 French Jews being interned in various camps, including Drancy.
On 3 October 1940, the Vichy government voluntarily promulgated the first Statute on Jews, which created a special underclass of French Jewish citizens, and enforced, for the first time in France, racial segregation. The October 1940 Statute excluded Jews from the administration, the armed forces, entertainment, arts, media, and certain professions, such as teaching, law, and medicine. A Commissariat-General for Jewish Affairs (CGQJ, "Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives") was created on 29 March 1941. It was directed by Xavier Vallat until May 1942, and then by Darquier de Pellepoix until February 1944. Mirroring the Reich Association of Jews, the "Union Générale des Israélites de France" was founded.
The police oversaw the confiscation of telephones and radios from Jewish homes and enforced a curfew on Jews starting in February 1942. They also enforced requirements that Jews not appear in public places, and ride only on the last car of the Parisian metro.
Along with many French police officials, André Tulard was present on the day of the inauguration of Drancy internment camp in 1941, which was used largely by French police as the central transit camp for detainees captured in France. All Jews and others "undesirables" passed through Drancy before heading to Auschwitz and other camps.
July 1942 Vel' d'Hiv Roundup.
In July 1942, under German orders, the French police organized the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup ("Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv") under orders by René Bousquet and his second in Paris, Jean Leguay with cooperation from authorities of the SNCF, the state railway company. The police arrested 13,152 Jews, including 4,051 children—which the "Gestapo" had not asked for—and 5,082 women on 16 and 17 July, and imprisoned them in the Winter Velodrome in unhygienic conditions. They were led to Drancy internment camp (run by Nazi Alois Brunner, who is still wanted for crimes against humanity, and French constabulary police), then crammed into box cars and shipped by rail to Auschwitz. Most of the victims died en route due to lack of food or water. The remaining survivors were sent to the gas chambers. This action alone represented more than a quarter of the 42,000 French Jews sent to concentration camps in 1942, of which only 811 would return after the end of the war. Although the Nazi VT (Verfügungstruppe) had initially directed the action, French police authorities vigorously participated. On 16 July 1995, President Jacques Chirac officially apologized for the participation of French police forces in the July 1942 raid. "There was no effective police resistance until the end of Spring of 1944", wrote historians Jean-Luc Einaudi and Maurice Rajsfus.
August 1942 and January 1943 raids.
The French police, headed by Bousquet, arrested 7,000 Jews in the southern zone in August 1942. 2,500 of them transited through the Camp des Milles near Aix-en-Provence before joining Drancy. Then, on 22, 23 and 24 January 1943, assisted by Bousquet's police force, the Germans organized a raid in Marseilles. During the Battle of Marseilles, the French police checked the identity documents of 40,000 people, and the operation succeeded in sending 2,000 Marseillese people in the death trains, leading to the extermination camps. The operation also encompassed the expulsion of an entire neighborhood (30,000 persons) in the Old Port before its destruction. For this occasion, SS-Gruppenführer Karl Oberg, in charge of the German Police in France, made the trip from Paris, and transmitted to Bousquet orders directly received from Heinrich Himmler. It is another notable case of the French police's willful collaboration with the Nazis.
French "collaborationnistes" and collaborators.
Stanley Hoffmann in 1974, and after him, other historians such as Robert Paxton and Jean-Pierre Azéma have used the term "collaborationnistes" to refer to fascists and Nazi sympathisers who, for ideological reasons, wished a reinforced collaboration with Hitler's Germany. Examples of these are Parti Populaire Français (PPF) leader Jacques Doriot, writer Robert Brasillach or Marcel Déat. A principal motivation and ideological foundation among "collaborationnistes" was anticommunism.
Organizations such as "La Cagoule" opposed the Third Republic, particularly when the left-wing Popular Front was in power.
Collaborationists may have influenced the Vichy government's policies, but ultra-collaborationists never comprised the majority of the government before 1944.
In order to enforce the régime's will, some paramilitary organizations were created. A notable example was the ""Légion Française des Combattants"" (LFC) (French Legion of Fighters), including at first only former combatants, but quickly adding ""Amis de la Légion"" and cadets of the Légion, who had never seen battle, but who supported Pétain's régime. The name was then quickly changed to ""Légion Française des Combattants et des volontaires de la Révolution Nationale"" (French Legion of Fighters and Volunteers of the National Revolution). Joseph Darnand created a ""Service d'Ordre Légionnaire"" (SOL), which consisted mostly of French supporters of the Nazis, of which Pétain fully approved.
Relationships with the Allied powers.
The US position towards Vichy France and De Gaulle was especially hesitant and inconsistent. President Roosevelt disliked Charles de Gaulle, whom he regarded as an "apprentice dictator." Robert Murphy, Roosevelt's representative in North Africa, started preparing the landing in North Africa from December 1940 (i.e. a year before the US entered the war). The US first tried to support General Maxime Weygand, general delegate of Vichy for Africa until December 1941. This first choice having failed, they turned to Henri Giraud shortly before the landing in North Africa on 8 November 1942. Finally, after François Darlan's turn towards the Free Forces – Darlan had been president of Council of Vichy from February 1941 to April 1942 – they played him against de Gaulle. US General Mark W. Clark of the combined Allied command made Admiral Darlan sign on 22 November 1942 a treaty putting "North Africa at the disposition of the Americans" and making France "a vassal country." Washington then imagined, between 1941 and 1942, a protectorate status for France, which would be submitted after the Liberation to an Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories (AMGOT) like Germany. After the assassination of Darlan on 24 December 1942, Washington turned again towards Henri Giraud, to whom had rallied Maurice Couve de Murville, who had financial responsibilities in Vichy, and Lemaigre-Dubreuil, a former member of "La Cagoule" and entrepreneur, as well as Alfred Pose, general director of the "Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie" (National Bank for Trade and Industry).
Creation of the Free French Forces.
To counter the Vichy regime, General Charles de Gaulle created the Free French Forces (FFL) after his Appeal of 18 June 1940 radio speech. Initially, Winston Churchill was ambivalent about de Gaulle and he dropped ties with Vichy only when it became clear they would not fight. Even so, the Free France headquarters in London was riven with internal divisions and jealousies.
The additional participation of Free French forces in the Syrian operation was controversial within Allied circles. It raised the prospect of Frenchmen shooting at Frenchmen, raising fears of a civil war. Additionally, it was believed that the Free French were widely reviled within Vichy military circles, and that Vichy forces in Syria were less likely to resist the British if they were not accompanied by elements of the Free French. Nevertheless, de Gaulle convinced Churchill to allow his forces to participate, although de Gaulle was forced to agree to a joint British and Free French proclamation promising that Syria and Lebanon would become fully independent at the end of the war.
However, there were still French naval ships under Vichy French control. A large squadron was in port at Mers El Kébir harbour near Oran. Vice Admiral Somerville, with Force H under his command, was instructed to deal with the situation in July 1940. Various terms were offered to the French squadron, but all were rejected. Consequently, Force H opened fire on the French ships. Nearly 1,000 French sailors died when the blew up in the attack. Less than two weeks after the armistice, Britain had fired upon forces of its former ally. The result was shock and resentment towards the UK within the French Navy, and to a lesser extent in the general French public.
Social and economic history.
Vichy authorities were strongly opposed to "modern" social trends and tried through "national regeneration" to restore behavior more in line with traditional Catholicism.
Economy.
Vichy rhetoric exalted the skilled laborer and small businessman. In practice, however, the needs of artisans for raw materials was neglected in favor of large businesses. The General Committee for the Organization of Commerce (CGOC) was a national program to modernize and professionalize small business.
In 1940 the government took direct control of all production, which was synchronized with the demands of the Germans. It replaced free trade unions with compulsory state unions that dictated labor policy without regard to the voice or needs of the workers. The centralized, bureaucratic control of the French economy was not a success, as German demands grew heavier and more unrealistic, passive resistance and inefficiencies multiplied, and Allied bombers hit the rail yards; however, Vichy made the first comprehensive long-range plans for the French economy. The government had never before attempted a comprehensive overview. De Gaulle's Provisional Government in 1944–45, quietly used the Vichy plans as a base for its own reconstruction program. The Monnet Plan of 1946 was closely based on Vichy plans. Thus both teams of wartime and early postwar planners repudiated prewar laissez-faire practices and embraced the cause of drastic economic overhaul and a planned economy.
Forced labor.
Nazi Germany kept the French POWs as forced laborers throughout the war. They added compulsory (and volunteer) workers from occupied nations, especially in metal factories. The shortage of volunteers led the Vichy government to pass a law in September 1942 that effectively deported workers to Germany, where, they constituted 15% of the labor force by August 1944. The largest number worked in the giant Krupp steel works in Essen. Low pay, long hours, frequent bombings, and crowded air raid shelters added to the unpleasantness of poor housing, inadequate heating, limited food, and poor medical care, all compounded by harsh Nazi discipline. They finally returned home in the summer of 1945. The forced labor draft encouraged the French Resistance and undermined the Vichy government.
Food shortages.
Civilians suffered shortages of all varieties of consumer goods. The rationing system was stringent but badly mismanaged, leading to produced malnourishment, black markets, and hostility to state management of the food supply. The Germans seized about 20% of the French food production, which caused severe disruption to the household economy of the French people. French farm production fell in half because of lack of fuel, fertilizer and workers; even so the Germans seized half the meat, 20 percent of the produce, and 2 percent of the champagne. Supply problems quickly affected French stores which lacked most items. The government answered by rationing, but German officials set the policies and hunger prevailed, especially affecting youth in urban areas. The queues lengthened in front of shops. Some people—including German soldiers—benefited from the black market, where food was sold without tickets at very high prices. Farmers especially diverted meat to the black market, which meant that much less for the open market. Counterfeit food tickets were also in circulation. Direct buying from farmers in the countryside and barter against cigarettes became common. These activities were strictly forbidden, however, and thus carried out at the risk of confiscation and fines. Food shortages were most acute in the large cities. In the more remote country villages, however, clandestine slaughtering, vegetable gardens and the availability of milk products permitted better survival. The official ration provided starvation level diets of 1300 or fewer calories a day, supplemented by home gardens and, especially, black market purchases.
Women.
The 2 million French soldiers held as POWs and forced laborers in Germany throughout the war were not at risk of death in combat but the anxieties of separation for their 800,000 wives were high. The government provided a modest allowance, but one in ten became prostitutes to support their families.
Meanwhile the Vichy regime promoted a highly traditional model of female roles. The Révolution Nationale official ideology fostered the patriarchal family, headed by a man with a subservient wife who was devoted to her many children. It gave women a key symbolic role to carry out the national regeneration. It used propaganda, women's organizations, and legislation to promote maternity, patriotic duty, and female submission to marriage, home, and children's education. The falling birthrate appeared to be a grave problem to Vichy. It introduced family allowances and opposed birth control and abortion. Conditions were very difficult for housewives, as food was short as well as most necessities. Mother's Day became a major date in the Vichy calendar, with festivities in the towns and schools featuring the award of medals to mothers of numerous children. Divorce laws were made much more stringent, and restrictions were placed on the employment of married women. Family allowances that had begun in the 1930s were continued, and became a vital lifeline for many families; it was a monthly cash bonus for having more children. In 1942 the birth rate started to rise, and by 1945 it was higher than it had been for a century.
On the other side women of the Resistance, many of whom were associated with combat groups linked to the French Communist Party (PCF), broke the gender barrier by fighting side by side with men. After the war, their services were ignored, but France did give women the vote in 1944.
French colonies and Vichy.
In Central Africa, three of the four colonies in French Equatorial Africa went over to the Free French almost immediately, Chad on 26 August 1940, French Congo on 29 August 1940, and Ubangi-Shari on 30 August 1940. They were joined by the separate colony of Cameroon on 27 August 1940. The final colony in French Equatorial Africa, Gabon, had to be occupied by military force between 27 October and 12 November 1940. In time, the majority of the colonies tended to switch to the Allied side peacefully in response to persuasion and to changing events. This did not, however, happen overnight: Guadeloupe and Martinique in the West Indies, as well as French Guiana on the northern coast of South America, did not join the Free French until 1943. Meanwhile, France's Arab colonies (Syria, Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco) generally remained under Vichy control until captured by Allied forces. This was chiefly because their proximity to Europe made them easier to maintain without Allied interference; this same proximity also gave them strategic importance for the European theater of the war. Conversely, more remote French possessions sided with the Free French Forces early, whether upon Free French action such as in Saint Pierre and Miquelon (despite U.S. wishes to the contrary) or spontaneously such as in French Polynesia.
Conflicts with Britain in Mers-el-Kebir, Dakar, Gibraltar, Libreville, Syria, and Madagascar.
Relations between the United Kingdom and the Vichy government were difficult. The Vichy government broke off diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom on 5 July 1940, after the Royal Navy attacked the French fleet in port at Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria in order to deny the possibility their use by Germany. The destruction of the fleet followed a standoff during which the British insisted that the French either scuttle their vessels, sail to a neutral port or join them in the war against Germany. These options were refused and the fleet was destroyed. This move by Britain hardened relations between the two former allies and caused more of the French population to side with Vichy against the British-supported Free French.
On 23 September 1940, the British Royal Navy and Free French forces under General De Gaulle launched Operation Menace, an attempt to seize the strategic, Vichy-held port of Dakar in French West Africa (modern Senegal). After attempts to encourage them to join the allies were rebuffed by the defenders, a sharp fight erupted between Vichy and Allied forces. HMS "Resolution" was heavily damaged by torpedoes, and Free French troops landing at a beach south of the port were driven off by heavy fire. Even worse from a strategic point of view, bombers of the Vichy French Air Force ("Armée de l'Air de Vichy") based in North Africa began bombing the British base at Gibraltar in response to the attack on Dakar. Shaken by the resolute Vichy defense, and not wanting to further escalate the conflict, British and Free French forces withdrew on 25 September, bringing the battle to an end.
On 8 November 1940, Free French forces under the command of Charles de Gaulle and Pierre Koenig, along with the assistance of the British Royal Navy, invaded Vichy held Gabon. Gabon, which was the only territory of French Equatorial Africa that was unwilling to join the Free French Forces, fell into allied hands on 12 November 1940, after the capital Libreville was bombed and captured. The final Vichy troops in Gabon surrendered without any military confrontation with the allies at Port-Gentil. The capture of Gabon by the Allies was crucial for ensuring that the entire French Equatorial Africa was out of Axis reach.
The next flashpoint between Britain and Vichy France came when a revolt in Iraq was put down by British forces in June 1941. German Air Force ("Luftwaffe") and Italian Air Force ("Regia Aeronautica") aircraft, staging through the French possession of Syria, intervened in the fighting in small numbers. That highlighted Syria as a threat to British interests in the Middle East. Consequently, on 8 June, British and Commonwealth forces invaded Syria and Lebanon. This was known as the Syria-Lebanon campaign or Operation Exporter. The Syrian capital, Damascus, was captured on 17 June and the five-week campaign ended with the fall of Beirut and the Convention of Acre ("Armistice of Saint Jean d'Acre") on 14 July 1941.
From 5 May to 6 November 1942 British and Commonwealth forces conducted Operation Ironclad, the seizure of the large, Vichy French-controlled island of Madagascar, which the British feared Japanese forces might use as a base to disrupt trade and communications in the Indian Ocean. The initial landing at Diégo-Suarez was relatively quick, though it took British forces a further six months to gain control of the entire island.
Indochina.
In June 1940 the Fall of France made the French hold on Indochina tenuous. The isolated colonial administration, led by Patrick He, was cut off from outside help and outside supplies. After negotiations with Japan the French allowed the Japanese to set up military bases in Indochina.
This seemingly subservient behavior convinced the regime of Major-General Plaek Pibulsonggram, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand, that Vichy France would not seriously resist a confrontation with Thailand. In October 1940, the military forces of Thailand attacked across the border with Indochina and launched the Franco-Thai War. Though the French won an important naval victory over the Thais, the Japanese forced the French to accept their mediation of a peace treaty that returned parts of Cambodia and Laos that had been taken from Thailand around the start of the 20th century to Thai control. This territorial loss was a major blow to French pride, especially since the ruins of Angkor Wat, of which the French were especially proud, were located in the region of Cambodia returned to Thailand.
The French were left in place to administer the rump colony until 9 March 1945, when the Japanese staged a "coup d'état" in French Indochina and took control of Indochina establishing their own colony, the Empire of Vietnam, as a double puppet state.
India.
Until 1962, France possessed four small non-contiguous but politically united colonies across India, the largest being located in Southeast India, Pondicherry. Immediately after the fall of France, the Governor General of French India, Louis Alexis Étienne Bonvin, declared the French colonies in India would continue to fight with its British allies. Free French forces participated in the Western Desert campaign, although news of the death of French-Indian soldiers caused some disturbances in Pondicherry.
French Somaliland.
During the Italian invasion and occupation of Ethiopia in the mid-1930s and during the early stages of World War II, constant border skirmishes occurred between the forces in French Somaliland and the forces in Italian East Africa. After the Fall of France in 1940, French Somaliland declared loyalty to Vichy France. The colony remained loyal to Vichy France during the East African Campaign but stayed out of that conflict. This lasted until December 1942. By that time, the Italians had been defeated and the French colony was isolated by a British blockade. Free French and Allied forces recaptured the colony's capital of Djibouti at the end of 1942. A local battalion from Djibouti participated in the liberation of France in 1944.
French North Africa.
Operation Torch was the American and British invasion of French North Africa, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, started on 8 November 1942, with landings in Morocco and Algeria. The long-term goal was to clear Germany and Italy from North Africa, enhance naval control of the Mediterranean, and prepare an invasion of Italy in 1943. The Vichy forces resisted briefly, then under the leadership of Vichy Admiral Darlan (who happened to be on the scene), cooperated with the Allies. The Allies recognized Darlan's self-nomination as High Commissioner of France (head of civil government) for North and West Africa. He ordered Vichy forces there to cease resisting and cooperate with the Allies, and they did so. By the time the Tunisia Campaign was fought, the French forces in North Africa had gone over to the Allied side, joining the Free French Forces.
Oceania.
The French possessions in Oceania joined the Free French side in 1940, or in one case in 1942. They then served as bases for the Allied effort in the Pacific and contributed troops to the Free French Forces.
New Hebrides.
In the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu), then a French-British condominium, Resident Commissioner Henri Sautot quickly led the French community to join the Free French side. The outcome was decided by a combination of patriotism and economic opportunism in the expectation independence would result.
French Polynesia.
Following the Appeal of 18 June, debate arose among the population of French Polynesia. A referendum was organized on 2 September 1940 in Tahiti and Moorea, with outlying islands reporting agreement in following days. The vote was 5564 to 18 in favor of joining the Free French side. Following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, American forces identified French Polynesia as an ideal refuelling point between Hawaii and Australia and, with de Gaulle's agreement, organized "Operation Bobcat" sending nine ships with 5,000 GIs who built a naval refuelling base and airstrip and set up coastal defense guns on Bora Bora. This first experience was valuable in later Seabee efforts in the Pacific, and the Bora Bora base supplied the Allied ships and planes that fought the Battle of the Coral Sea. Troops from French Polynesia and New Caledonia formed a "Bataillon du Pacifique" in 1940; became part of the 1st Free French Division in 1942, distinguishing themselves during the Battle of Bir Hakeim and subsequently combining with another unit to form the "Bataillon d'infanterie de marine et du Pacifique"; fought in the Italian Campaign, distinguishing itself at the Garigliano during the Battle of Monte Cassino and on to Tuscany; and participated in the Provence landings and onwards to the liberation of France.
Wallis and Futuna.
In Wallis and Futuna the local administrator and bishop sided with Vichy, but faced opposition from some of the population and clergy; their attempts at naming a local king in 1941 (to buffer the territory from their opponents) backfired as the newly elected king refused to declare allegiance to Pétain. The situation stagnated for a long while, due to the great remoteness of the islands and the fact that no overseas ship visited the islands for 17 months after January 1941. An aviso sent from Nouméa took over Wallis on behalf of the Free French on 27 May 1942, and Futuna on 29 May 1942. This allowed American forces to build an airbase and seaplane base on Wallis (Navy 207) that served the Allied Pacific operations.
New Caledonia.
In New Caledonia Henri Sautot again led prompt allegiance to the Free French side, effective 19 September 1940. Due to its location on the edge of the Coral Sea and on the flank of Australia, New Caledonia became strategically critical in the effort to combat the Japanese advance in the Pacific in 1941–1942 and to protect the sea lanes between North America and Australia. Nouméa served as a headquarters of the United States Navy and Army in the South Pacific, and as a repair base for Allied vessels. New Caledonia contributed personnel both to the "Bataillon du Pacifique" and to the Free French Naval Forces that saw action in the Pacific and Indian Ocean.
German invasion, November 1942 and decline of the Vichy regime.
Hitler ordered "Case Anton" to occupy Corsica and then the rest of unoccupied southern zone in immediate reaction to the landing of the Allies in North Africa (Operation Torch) on 8 November 1942. Following the conclusion of the operation on 12 November, Vichy's remaining military forces were disbanded. Vichy continued to exercise its remaining jurisdiction over almost all of metropolitan France, with the residual power devolved into the hands of Laval, until the gradual collapse of the regime following the Allied invasion in June 1944. On 7 September 1944, following the Allied invasion of France, the remainders of the Vichy government cabinet fled to Germany and established a puppet government in exile at Sigmaringen. That rump government finally fell when the city was taken by the Allied French army in April 1945.
Part of the residual legitimacy of the Vichy regime resulted from the continued ambivalence of U.S. and British leaders. President Roosevelt continued to cultivate Vichy, and promoted General Henri Giraud as a preferable alternative to de Gaulle, despite the poor performance of Vichy forces in North Africa—Admiral François Darlan had landed in Algiers the day before Operation Torch. Algiers was headquarters of the Vichy French XIX Army Corps, which controlled Vichy military units in North Africa. Darlan was neutralized within 15 hours by a 400-strong French resistance force. Roosevelt and Churchill accepted Darlan, rather than de Gaulle, as the French leader in North Africa. De Gaulle had not even been informed of the landing in North Africa. The United States also resented the Free French taking control of St Pierre and Miquelon on 24 December 1941, because, Secretary of State Hull believed, it interfered with a U.S.-Vichy agreement to maintain the status quo with respect to French territorial possessions in the western hemisphere.
Following the invasion of France via Normandy and Provence (Operation Overlord and Operation Dragoon) and the departure of the Vichy leaders, the U.S., Britain and the Soviet Union finally recognized the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF), headed by de Gaulle, as the legitimate government of France on 23 October 1944. Before that, the first return of democracy to mainland France since 1940 had occurred with the declaration of the Free Republic of Vercors on 3 July 1944, at the behest of the Free French government—but that act of resistance was quashed by an overwhelming German attack by the end of July.
North Africa.
In North Africa, after 8 November 1942 putsch by the French resistance, most Vichy figures were arrested (including General Alphonse Juin, chief commander in North Africa, and Admiral François Darlan). However, Darlan was released and U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower finally accepted his self-nomination as high commissioner of North Africa and French West Africa ("Afrique occidentale française", AOF), a move that enraged de Gaulle, who refused to recognize Darlan's status. After Darlan signed an armistice with the Allies and took power in North Africa, Germany violated the 1940 armistice and invaded Vichy France on 10 November 1942 (operation code-named Case Anton), triggering the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon.
Giraud arrived in Algiers on 10 November, and agreed to subordinate himself to Admiral Darlan as the French African army commander. Even though he was now in the Allied camp, Darlan maintained the repressive Vichy system in North Africa, including concentration camps in southern Algeria and racist laws. Detainees were also forced to work on the Transsaharien railroad. Jewish goods were "aryanized" (i.e., stolen), and a special Jewish Affair service was created, directed by Pierre Gazagne. Numerous Jewish children were prohibited from going to school, something which not even Vichy had implemented in metropolitan France. The admiral was killed on 24 December 1942, in Algiers by the young monarchist Bonnier de La Chapelle. Although de la Chapelle had been a member of the resistance group led by Henri d'Astier de La Vigerie, it is believed he was acting as an individual.
After Admiral Darlan's assassination, Giraud became his "de facto" successor in French Africa with Allied support. This occurred through a series of consultations between Giraud and de Gaulle. The latter wanted to pursue a political position in France and agreed to have Giraud as commander in chief, as the more qualified military person of the two. It is questionable that he ordered that many French resistance leaders who had helped Eisenhower's troops be arrested, without any protest by Roosevelt's representative, Robert Murphy. Later, the Americans sent Jean Monnet to counsel Giraud and to press him into repeal the Vichy laws. After difficult negotiations, Giraud agreed to suppress the racist laws, and to liberate Vichy prisoners of the South Algerian concentration camps. The Cremieux decree, which granted French citizenship to Jews in Algeria and which had been repealed by Vichy, was immediately restored by General de Gaulle.
Giraud took part in the Casablanca conference, with Roosevelt, Churchill and de Gaulle, in January 1943. The Allies discussed their general strategy for the war, and recognized joint leadership of North Africa by Giraud and de Gaulle. Henri Giraud and Charles de Gaulle then became co-presidents of the "Comité français de la Libération Nationale", which unified the Free French Forces and territories controlled by them and had been founded at the end of 1943. Democratic rule was restored in French Algeria, and the Communists and Jews liberated from the concentration camps.
At the end of April 1945 Pierre Gazagne, secretary of the general government headed by Yves Chataigneau, took advantage of his absence to exile anti-imperialist leader Messali Hadj and arrest the leaders of his party, the Algerian People's Party (PPA). On the day of the Liberation of France, the GPRF would harshly repress a rebellion in Algeria during the Sétif massacre of 8 May 1945, which has been qualified by some historians as the "real beginning of the Algerian War".
Independence of the SOL.
In 1943 the "Service d'ordre légionnaire" (SOL) collaborationist militia, headed by Joseph Darnand, became independent and was transformed into the ""Milice française"" (French Militia). Officially directed by Pierre Laval himself, the SOL was led by Darnand, who held an SS rank and pledged an oath of loyalty to Adolf Hitler. Under Darnand and his sub-commanders, such as Paul Touvier and Jacques de Bernonville, the Milice was responsible for helping the German forces and police in the repression of the French Resistance and "Maquis".
In addition, the "Milice" participated with area "Gestapo" head Klaus Barbie in seizing members of the resistance and minorities including Jews for shipment to detention centres, such as the Drancy deportation camp, en route to Auschwitz, and other German concentration camps, including Dachau and Buchenwald.
Jewish death toll.
In 1940 approximately 350,000 Jews lived in metropolitan France, less than half of them with French citizenship (and the others foreigners, mostly exiles from Germany during the 1930s). About 200,000 of them, and the large majority of foreign Jews, resided in Paris and its outskirts. Among the 150,000 French Jews, about 30,000, generally native from Central Europe, had been naturalized French during the 1930s. Of the total, approximately 25,000 French Jews and 50,000 foreign Jews were deported. According to historian Robert Paxton, 76,000 Jews were deported and died in concentration and extermination camps. Including the Jews who died in concentration camps in France, this would have made for a total figure of 90,000 Jewish deaths (a quarter of the total Jewish population before the war, by his estimate). Paxton's numbers imply that 14,000 Jews died in French concentration camps. However, the systematic census of Jewish deportees from France (citizens or not) drawn under Serge Klarsfeld concluded that 3,000 had died in French concentration camps and 1,000 more had been shot. Of the approximately 76,000 deported, 2,566 survived. The total thus reported is slightly below 77,500 dead (somewhat less than a quarter of the Jewish population in France in 1940).
Proportionally, either number makes for a lower death toll than in some other countries (in the Netherlands, 75% of the Jewish population was murdered). This fact has been used as arguments by supporters of Vichy. However, according to Paxton, the figure would have been greatly lower if the "French state" had not willfully collaborated with Germany, which lacked staff for police activities. During the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup of July 1942, Laval ordered the deportation of the children, against explicit German orders. Paxton pointed out that if the total number of victims had not been higher, it was due to the shortage in wagons, the resistance of the civilian population and deportation in other countries (notably in Italy).
Liberation of France and aftermath.
Sigmaringen commission.
Following the Liberation of Paris on 25 August 1944, Pétain and his ministers were taken to Germany by the German forces. There, Fernand de Brinon established a pseudo-government in exile at Sigmaringen. Pétain refused to participate and the Sigmaringen operation had little or no authority. The offices used the official title "French Delegation" () or the "French Government Commission for the Protection of National Interests" (). Sigmaringen had its own radio ("Radio-patrie", "Ici la France"), press ("La France", "Le Petit Parisien") and hosted the embassies of the Axis powers, Germany, Italy and Japan. The population of the enclave was about 6,000 citizens including known collaborationist journalists, writers (Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Lucien Rebatet), actors (Le Vigan) and their families plus 500 soldiers, 700 French SS, POWs and French civilian forced laborers.
Actions of the French provisional government.
The Free French, fearing that the Allies could decide to put France under the rule of AMGOT, strove to establish quickly the Provisional Government of the French Republic. The first action of that government was to re-establish republican legality throughout metropolitan France.
The provisional government considered that the Vichy government had been unconstitutional and thus that all its actions had been illegal. All statutes, laws, regulations and decisions by the Vichy government were thus made null and devoid of effects. However, since mass cancellation of all decisions taken by Vichy, including many that could have been taken as well by Republican governments, was impractical, it was decided that cancellation was to be expressly acknowledged by the government. A number of laws and acts were however explicitly repealed, including all constitutional acts, all laws discriminating against Jews, all acts against "secret societies" (e.g., Freemasons), and all acts creating special tribunals.
Collaborationist paramilitary and political organizations, such as the Milice and the "Service d'ordre légionnaire", were also disbanded.
The provisional government also took steps to replace local governments, including governments that had been suppressed by the Vichy regime, through new elections or by extending the terms of those who had been elected no later than 1939.
Purges.
After the liberation, France was swept for a short period with a wave of executions of Collaborationists. Collaborationists were brought to the Vélodrome d'hiver, Fresnes prison or the Drancy internment camp. Women who were suspected of having romantic liaisons with Germans, or more often of being prostitutes who had entertained German customers, were publicly humiliated by having their heads shaved. Those who had engaged in the black market were also stigmatized as "war profiteers" ("profiteurs de guerre"), and popularly called "BOF" ("Beurre Oeuf Fromage", or Butter Eggs Cheese, because of the products sold at outrageous prices during the Occupation). However, the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF, 1944–46) quickly reestablished order, and brought Collaborationists before the courts. Many convicted Collaborationists were then given amnesty under the Fourth Republic (1946–54).
Four different periods are distinguished by historians:
Other historians have distinguished the purges against intellectuals (Brasillach, Céline, etc.), industrialists, fighters (LVF, etc.) and civil servants (Papon, etc.).
Philippe Pétain was charged with treason in July 1945. He was convicted and sentenced to death by firing squad, but Charles de Gaulle commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. In the police, some collaborators soon resumed official responsibilities. This continuity of the administration was pointed out, in particular concerning the events of the Paris massacre of 1961, executed under the orders of head of the Parisian police Maurice Papon when Charles de Gaulle was head of state. Papon was tried and convicted for crimes against humanity in 1998.
The French members of the Waffen-SS "Charlemagne" Division who survived the war were regarded as traitors. Some of the more prominent officers were executed, while the rank-and-file were given prison terms; some of them were given the option of doing time in Indochina (1946–54) with the Foreign Legion instead of prison.
Among artists, singer Tino Rossi was detained in Fresnes prison, where, according to "Combat" newspaper, prison guards asked him for autographs. Pierre Benoit and Arletty were also detained.
Executions without trials and other forms of "popular justice" were harshly criticized immediately after the war, with circles close to Pétainists advancing the figures of 100,000, and denouncing the "Red Terror", "anarchy", or "blind vengeance". The writer and Jewish internee Robert Aron estimated the popular executions to a number of 40,000 in 1960. This surprised de Gaulle, who estimated the number to be around 10,000, which is also the figure accepted today by mainstream historians. Approximately 9,000 of these 10,000 refer to summary executions in the whole of the country, which occurred during battle.
Some imply that France did too little to deal with collaborators at this stage, by selectively pointing out that in absolute value (numbers), there were fewer legal executions in France than in its smaller neighbor Belgium, and fewer internments than in Norway or the Netherlands. However, the situation in Belgium was not comparable as it mixed collaboration with elements of a war of secession: The 1940 invasion prompted the Flemish population to generally side with the Germans in the hope of gaining national recognition, and relative to national population a much higher proportion of Belgians than French thus ended up collaborating with the Nazis or volunteering to fight alongside them; the Walloon population in turn led massive anti-Flemish retribution after the war, some of which, such as the execution of Irma Swertvaeger Laplasse, remained controversial.
The proportion of collaborators was also higher in Norway, and collaboration occurred on a larger scale in the Netherlands (as in Flanders) based partly on linguistic and cultural commonality with Germany. The internments in Norway and Netherlands, meanwhile, were highly temporary and were rather indiscriminate; there was a brief internment peak in these countries as internment was used partly for the purpose of separating Collaborationists from non-Collaborationists. Norway ended up executing only 37 Collaborationists.
1980s trials.
Some accused war criminals were judged, some for a second time, from the 1980s onwards: Paul Touvier, Klaus Barbie, Maurice Papon, René Bousquet (the head of the French police during the war) and his deputy Jean Leguay. Bousquet and Leguay were both convicted for their responsibilities in the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup of July 1942. Among others, Nazi hunters Serge and Beate Klarsfeld spent part of their post-war effort trying to bring them before the courts. A fair number of collaborationists then joined the OAS terrorist movement during the Algerian War (1954–62). Jacques de Bernonville escaped to Quebec, then Brazil. Jacques Ploncard d'Assac became counsellor to the dictator António de Oliveira Salazar in Portugal. 
In 1993, former Vichy official René Bousquet was assassinated while he awaited prosecution in Paris following a 1991 inculpation for crimes against humanity; he had been prosecuted but partially acquitted and immediately amnestied in 1949. In 1994 former Vichy official Paul Touvier (1915–1996) was convicted of crimes against humanity. Maurice Papon was likewise convicted in 1998, released three years later due to ill health, and died in 2007.
Historiographical debates and France's responsibility: the "Vichy Syndrome".
Up to Jacques Chirac's presidency, the official point of view of the French government was that the Vichy regime was an illegal government distinct from the French Republic, established by traitors under foreign influence. Indeed, Vichy France eschewed the formal name of France ("French Republic") and styled itself the "French State", replacing the Republican motto of "Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité" (liberty, equality, fraternity) inherited from the 1789 French Revolution, with the reactionary motto "Travail, Famille, Patrie" (work, family, fatherland).
While the criminal behavior of Vichy France was consistently acknowledged, this point of view denied any responsibility of the state of France, alleging that acts committed between 1940 and 1944 were unconstitutional acts devoid of legitimacy. The main proponent of this view was Charles de Gaulle himself, who insisted, as did other historians afterwards, on the unclear conditions of the June 1940 vote granting full powers to Pétain, which was refused by the minority of Vichy 80. In particular, coercive measures used by Pierre Laval have been denounced by those historians who hold that the vote did not, therefore, have Constitutional legality (See subsection: "Conditions of armistice and 10 July 1940 vote of full powers").
Nevertheless, on 16 July 1995, President Jacques Chirac, in a speech, recognized the responsibility of the French State for seconding the "criminal folly of the occupying country", in particular the help of the French police, headed by René Bousquet, which assisted the Nazis in the enactment of the so-called "Final Solution". The July 1942 Vel' d'Hiv Roundup is a tragic example of how the French police did the Nazi work, going even further than what military orders demanded (by sending children to Drancy internment camp, last stop before the extermination camps).
As historian Henry Rousso has put it in "The Vichy Syndrome" (1987), Vichy and the state collaboration of France remains a "past that doesn't pass." Historiographical debates are still, today, passionate, opposing conflictual views on the nature and legitimacy of Vichy's collaborationism with Germany in the implementation of the Holocaust. Three main periods have been distinguished in the historiography of Vichy: first the Gaullist period, which aimed at national reconciliation and unity under the figure of Charles de Gaulle, who conceived himself above political parties and divisions; then the 1960s, with Marcel Ophüls's film "The Sorrow and the Pity" (1971); finally the 1990s, with the trial of Maurice Papon, civil servant in Bordeaux in charge of the "Jewish Questions" during the war, who was convicted after a very long trial (1981–1998) for crimes against humanity. The trial of Papon did not only concern an individual itinerary, but the French administration's collective responsibility in the deportation of the Jews. Furthermore, his career after the war, which led him to be successively prefect of the Paris police during the Algerian War (1954–1962) and then treasurer of the Gaullist Union des Démocrates pour la République party from 1968 to 1971, and finally Budget Minister under president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and prime minister Raymond Barre from 1978 to 1981, was symptomatic of the quick rehabilitation of former Collaborationists after the war. Critics contend that this itinerary, shared by others (although few had such public roles), demonstrates France's collective amnesia, while others point out that the perception of the war and of the state collaboration has evolved during these years. Papon's career was considered more scandalous as he had been responsible, during his function as prefect of police of Paris, for the 1961 Paris massacre of Algerians during the war, and was forced to resign from this position after the "disappearance", in Paris in 1965, of the Moroccan anti-colonialist leader Mehdi Ben Barka.
While it is certain that the Vichy government and a large number of its high administration collaborated in the implementation of the Holocaust, the exact level of such cooperation is still debated. Compared with the Jewish communities established in other countries invaded by Germany, French Jews suffered proportionately lighter losses (see Jewish death toll section above); although, starting in 1942, repression and deportations struck French Jews as well as foreign Jews. Former Vichy officials later claimed that they did as much as they could to minimize the impact of the Nazi policies, although mainstream French historians contend that the Vichy regime went beyond the Nazi expectations.
The regional newspaper "Nice Matin" revealed on 28 February 2007, that in more than 1,000 condominium properties on the Côte d'Azur, rules dating to Vichy were still "in force", or at least existed on paper. One of these rules, for example, stated that:
The contractors shall make the following statements: they are of French nationality, are not Jewish, nor married to Jewish in the sense of the laws and ordinances in force Vichy, NDLR
The president of the Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France-Côte d'Azur, a Jewish association group, issued a strong condemnation labeling it "the utmost horror" when one of the inhabitants of such a condominium qualified this as an "anachronism" with "no consequences." Jewish inhabitants were able and willing to live in the buildings, and to explain this the "Nice Matin" reporter surmised that some tenants may have not read the condominium contracts in detail, while others deemed the rules obsolete. A reason for the latter is that any racially discriminatory condominium or other local rule that may have existed "on paper", Vichy-era or otherwise, was invalidated by the constitutions of the French Fourth Republic (1946) and French Fifth Republic (1958) and was inapplicable under French antidiscrimination law. Thus, even if the tenants or coowners had signed or otherwise agreed to these rules after 1946, any such agreement would be null and void (caduque) under French law, as were the rules. Rewriting or eliminating the obsolete rules would have had to be done at the occupants' expense, including notary fees of 900 to 7000 EUR per building.
"Sword and shield" argument.
Today, the few Vichy supporters continue to maintain the official argument advanced by Pétain and Laval: the state collaboration was supposed to protect the French civilian population from the hardships of the Occupation. After the war, former Collaborationists and ""pétainistes"" (supporters of Pétain) claimed that while Charles de Gaulle had represented the "sword" of France, Pétain had been the "shield" which protected France.
"French Jews vs. foreign Jews": myth or reality?
Although this claim is rejected by the rest of the French population and by the state itself, another myth remains more widespread than this one. This other myth refers to the alleged "protection" by Vichy of French Jews by "accepting" to collaborate in the deportation—and, ultimately, in the extermination—of foreign Jews.
However, this argument has been rejected by several historians who are specialists of the subject, among them US historian Robert Paxton, who is widely recognized and whose foreign origin permits a more distant and objective judgment on the matter, and historian of the French police Maurice Rajsfus. Both were called on as experts during the Papon trial in the 1990s.
Robert Paxton thus declared, before the court, on 31 October 1997, that "Vichy took initiatives... The armistice let it a breathing space." Henceforth, on its own Vichy decided, on the domestic plan, to implement the "National Revolution" ("Révolution nationale"). After having designated the alleged responsibles of the defeat ("democracy, parliamentarism, cosmopolitanism, left-wing, foreigners, Jews...") Vichy put in place, as soon as 3 October 1940, the first "Statute on Jews." From then on, Jewish people were considered "second-zone citizens ".
On the international plan, France "believed the war to be finished". Thus, as soon as July 1940, Vichy eagerly negotiated with the German authorities in an attempt to gain a place for France in the Third Reich's "New Order". But "Hitler never forgot the 1918 defeat. He always said no." Vichy's ambition was doomed from the start.
"Antisemitism was a constant theme", recalled Robert Paxton. It even opposed itself, at first, to German plans. "At this period, the Nazis had not yet decided to exterminate the Jews, but to expel them. Their idea was not to make of France an antisemitic country. To the contrary, they wanted to send there the Jews that they expelled" from the Reich.
The historical turn took place in 1941–1942, with the pending German defeat on the Eastern Front. The war then became "total", and in August 1941, Hitler decided on the "global extermination of all European Jews." This new policy was officially formulated during the January 1942 Wannsee Conference, and implemented in all European occupied countries as soon as spring 1942. France, which praised itself for having remained an independent state (as opposed to other occupied countries) "decided to cooperate. This is the second Vichy." The first train of deportees left Drancy on 27 March 1942, for Poland—the first in a long series.
"The Nazis needed the French administration... They always complained about the lack of staff." recalled Paxton, something which Maurice Rajsfus has also underlined. Although the American historian recognized during the trial that the "civil behavior of certain individuals" had permitted many Jews to escape deportation, he stated that:
The French state, itself, has participated to the policy of extermination of the Jews... How can one pretend the reverse when such technical and administrative means have been put to this aim?
Evoking the French police's registering of the Jews, as well as Laval's decision, taken in August 1942 in all independence, to deport children along with their parents, Paxton added:
Contrary to preconceived ideas, Vichy did not sacrifice foreign Jews in the hope of protecting French Jews. At the summit of the hierarchy, it knew, from the start, that the departure of these last ones was unavoidable.
Despite Paxton's assertion about Vichy knowledge "from the start", deportations from France did not start until summer 1942, several months after mass deportation from other countries started. Part of the population housed at the Dachau concentration camp, which had been opened since 1933, was Jewish, and major death camps in Poland and Germany were opened in 1941 and early 1942.
Paxton then evoked the case of Italy, where deportation of Jewish people had only started after the German occupation—Italy surrendered to the Allies in mid-1943 but was then invaded by Germany and fighting there continued through 1944. In particular, in Nice, "Italians had protected the Jews. And the French authorities complained about it to the Germans." In this instance, deportations from Italy started immediately upon its invasion by Germany. In fact, the rise of Benito Mussolini and Italian fascism had drastically curtailed Jewish immigration during the inter-war period, and Italy had passed drastic anti-Semitic laws in 1938 that stripped Jews of their citizenship. Ultimately, a similar proportion of Jews from Italy as from France were deported.
More recent work by the historian Susan Zuccotti finds that the Vichy government facilitated the deportation of foreign Jews rather than French ones, all else equal, until at least 1943:
Vichy officials hoped to deport foreign Jews throughout France in order to ease pressure on native Jews. Pierre Laval himself expressed the official Vichy position... In the early months of 1943, the terror [Adam Munz and Feldman described in German-occupied France still was experienced by foreign Jews like themselves. It is difficult to know exactly how many French Jews were arrested, usually for specific or alleged offenses, but on 21 January 1943, Helmut Knochen informed Eichmann in Berlin that there were 2,159 French citizens among the 3,811 prisoners at Drancy. Many had been at Drancy for several months. They had not been deported because, until January 1943, there had usually been enough foreigners and their children to fill the forty-three trains that had carried about 41,591 people to the east... By January 1943, however, foreign Jews were increasingly aware of the danger and difficult to find. Nazi pressure for the arrest of French Jews and the deportation of those already at Drancy increased accordingly. Thus, when Knochen reported that there were 2,159 French citizens among the 3,811 prisoners at Drancy on 21 January 1943, he also asked Eichmann for permission to deport them. There had been no convoy from Drancy in December and January, and [SS Lieutenant Heinz Röthke was pressuring Knochen to resume them. Röthke also wanted to empty Drancy in order to refill it. Despite Vichy officials' past disapproval and Eichmann's own prior discouragement of such a step, permission for the deportation of the French Jews at Drancy, except for those in mixed marriages, was granted from Berlin on 25 January.
Whatever the Vichy government's intent initially or subsequently, the numerical outcome was that less than 15% of French Jews, vs. nearly twice that proportion of non-citizen Jews residing in France, died. More Jews lived in France at the end of the Vichy regime than had approximately ten years earlier.

Lithographic limestone

Lithographic limestone is hard limestone that is sufficiently fine-grained, homogeneous and defect free to be used for lithography. Geologists use the term "lithographic texture" to refer to a grain size under 1/250 mm. The term "sublithographic" is sometimes used for homogeneous fine-grained limestone with a somewhat coarser texture.
Origin.
The generally accepted theory for the origin of lithographic and sublithographic limestones is that they were formed in shallow stagnant hypersaline and anoxic lagoons. The combination of mild hypersalinity and low oxygen content is believed to have inhibited the formation of microbial mats and prevented the invasion of bottom dwelling organisms. Microbial mats and bottom dwelling organisms would have left fossils, and bottom dwelling organisms would have churned the accumulating sediment, producing a less homogeneous rock. Stagnancy was required to avoid churning or sculpting of the sediment by currents or wave action.
Distribution.
Europe.
The original source for lithographic limestone was the Solnhofen Limestone named after the quarries of Solnhofen where it was first found. This is a late Jurassic deposit, part of a deposit of "plattenkalk" (a very fine-grained limestone that splits into thin plates, usually Micrite) that extends through the Swabian Alb and Franconian Alb in Southern Germany. Only a small fraction of plattenkalk is suitable for lithography.
For many years, the Solnhofen deposits were the only source of lithographic limestone. French lithographic limestone from quarries near Montdardier, about 6 km south of le Vigan, Gard was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851, where it earned an honorable mention. This stone is from the upper Lias Group, from the early Jurassic. The largest lithographic printing stone ever quarried came from Le Vigan, 230x150cm (90x59 in). Théophile Steinlen used a comparable stone for some of his posters. Several quarries are visible today on the chalky plateau above Montdardier, between 2 km north (), and 2 km west () of the town.
Shortly before 1867, a second lithographic limestone quarry was opened in France near Cerin and Crey, Isère (). The lithographic limestones of Cerin are from the Kimmeridgian stage of the Upper Jurassic, and as with the Solnhofen deposits, they preserve numerous interesting fossils.
Lithographic limestone from the Lower Cretaceous has been quarried near Santa Maria de Meià on the south flank of the Serra del Montsec in Spain. In 1902, L. M. Vidal, a mining engineer, recognized the importance of the fossils found there.
The Americas.
The American Lithographic Stone Company was organized in Louisville, Kentucky in late 1868. It initially focused its operation on quarries in Overton County, Tennessee, but shortly before 1900, it opened a quarry at Brandenburg, Kentucky. This quarry was the only commercial source of lithographic stone in the United States at the turn of the 20th century. Unlike the Solnhofen stone, Kentucky lithographic limestone was slightly dolomitic, and it was judged to be competitive with Solnhofen stone for some purposes, but not for the highest quality work. This stone source was sub-Carboniferous (Mississippian). In 1917, the Brandenburg quarry was judged the most important source of Lithographic stone in the United States. Prior to 1916, the output of the Brandenburg quarry was small, but in 1916, as World War I cut off access to Solnhofen stone, the quarry produced 20 tons of finished lithographic stone. The Remains of the Brandenburg Lithograph Quarry are located along the Buttermilk Falls Historic Walking Trail ().
In 1903, Clement L. Webster discovered a bed of lithographic limestone about 2 miles southwest of Orchard, Iowa. His company, the Interstate Investment & Development Company platted a town named Lithograph City nearby and opened a quarry (). The Lithograph City Formation of the Cedar Valley Group straddles the border between the Middle and Late Devonian and was named for its exposure in this quarry. Outcrops of this formation extend from near Cedar Falls, Iowa north into Minnesota. The suitability of Lithograph City limestone for lithography was tested by A. B. Hoen who reported that stone from two layers in the Lithograph City quarry was excellent for lithography and finer grained than the finest Solnhofen stone. Lithograph City was an important source of lithographic stone in the United States during World War I, but the quarries closed as metal printing plates replaced stone. In 1918, the Devonian Products Company took over the operation, focusing on the production of crushed rock and renaming the town Devonia. By 1938, the town had disappeared.

Gimli (Middle-earth)

Gimli is a fictional character from J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, featured in "The Lord of the Rings". A Dwarf warrior, he is the son of Glóin (a character from Tolkien's earlier novel, "The Hobbit").
Gimli is chosen to represent the race of Dwarves in the Fellowship of the Ring. As such, he is one of the primary characters of the novel. In the course of the adventure, Gimli aids the Ring-bearer, participates in the War of the Ring, and becomes close friends with Legolas, overcoming an ancient enmity of Dwarves and Elves.
Character overview.
Gimli was a member of Durin's Folk who volunteered to accompany Frodo Baggins as a member of the Fellowship of the Ring on the quest to destroy the One Ring. He was an honourable, wise, and stalwart warrior.
Gimli became deeply enamoured upon meeting the Elf-lady Galadriel, and forged a friendship with the Elf Legolas despite his original hostility (due to the fact that Legolas' father had once incarcerated his father); these relationships aided greatly in the rehabilitation of the long-troubled relationship between the Elves and the Dwarves of Middle-earth.
Appearances.
Literature.
Gimli was the son of Glóin, one of the former companions of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins (Tolkien's chief hero in his first fantasy novel, "The Hobbit").
He was a remote descendant of Durin the Deathless, chief of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves and ancestor to the Dwarven people to which Gimli belonged, the Longbeards. Gimli was of the royal line, but not close to the succession; he was the third cousin once removed of Dáin II Ironfoot, king of Durin's Folk, and the first cousin once removed of Balin, also one of Bilbo's former companions, and later Lord of Moria for a short time.
Gimli was introduced in the first volume of "The Lord of the Rings", "The Fellowship of the Ring", at the Council of Elrond Half-elven, which he attended together with his father to bring news of his home, Erebor (the Lonely Mountain). There they learned that Bilbo's kinsman Frodo now owned the One Ring, a Ring of Power forged and then lost by the Dark Lord Sauron. The Council decided to have it destroyed by casting it into the volcanic Mount Doom in Sauron's domain of Mordor. Frodo volunteered for the task, and Elrond chose eight people of varying races to aid him in his task — including Gimli. Thus, the Fellowship of the Ring was formed.
Within the Fellowship there was initially friction between Gimli and the Elf Legolas, for various reasons: their races bore an old grudge against each other over the ancient matter of the Necklace of the Dwarves and the destruction of Doriath, and more recently Thranduil, Legolas' father, once imprisoned Gimli's father Glóin (as described in "The Hobbit").
When the company was forced to enter an ancient underground Dwarf-realm, the Mines of Moria, Gimli was at first enthusiastic and hoped to find a recently established colony of his people there, led by Balin. However, Moria was still inhabited by a huge number of Orcs and several Cave Trolls, as well as a Balrog, and Balin and his folk were all dead. The Fellowship found his tomb in the Chamber of Records, together with a chronicle of events, but Orcs had discovered their presence and they had to fight their way out.
After their leader Gandalf the Wizard fell into a chasm during a heated battle with the Balrog, the Fellowship finally escaped the Mines. Aragorn, a Man and a Ranger, then led them to the forest of Lothlórien, populated by Elves who were not friendly to Dwarves. Gimli was told he had to be blindfolded if he was to enter the forest, and his refusal nearly led to a violent situation, which was defused only when Aragorn proposed that the entire Fellowship be blindfolded, which was done.
Gimli's opinion of Elves drastically changed when he met Galadriel, co-ruler of Lothlórien: her beauty, kindness, and understanding impressed Gimli so much that, when given the opportunity to ask for whatever he wished, he responded that being able to see her and hear her gentle words was a gift enough. When pressured further, he admits that he desires a single strand of her golden hair, so that he might treasure it and preserve it as an heirloom of his house, but that he does not ask for such a gift. Galadriel is so moved by his bold-yet-courteous request that she gave him not one, but three of her hairs. She also subsequently gave Gimli the name "Lockbearer" as a result. By the end of the sojourn in Lothlórien, Gimli had formed his unlikely friendship with Legolas.
At Amon Hen, the company was sundered, for the Man Boromir, son of the Steward of Gondor, tried to take the Ring from Frodo and use it for Gondor and his own gain in their ongoing war against Sauron. Frodo fled at this and went ahead, accompanied only by his gardener Samwise Gamgee.
In the second volume, "The Two Towers", the other members of the Fellowship were scattered while looking for Frodo, and by ill-chance the two other hobbits of the party, Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, were captured by Orcs who were stalking them. Boromir was mortally wounded defending them, and it fell to Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas to set him on a funeral boat. They decided to go after Merry and Pippin, for Frodo's mission was out of their hands.
After running a great distance in a few days and thus entering the land of Rohan, they met the Marshal Éomer and his riders, who had slain the Orc-band. When Éomer spoke ill of the name Galadriel, having been told false rumours about her, Gimli responded with overtly harsh words, leading to a hostile situation that again had to be defused by Aragorn. Continuing their search for the hobbits, they came across a resurrected Gandalf in Fangorn Forest, who assured them that the hobbits were now safe. Gandalf led them to Rohan's capital, Edoras, where he roused King Théoden, Éomer's uncle, out of inaction and exposed his counsellor Gríma as a spy.
Gimli proved his valour in combat in the ensuing Battle of the Hornburg against the forces of Saruman. In that battle, he and Legolas engaged in an Orc-slaying contest (Gimli won by one; he killed 42 to Legolas' 41), although he received a minor head injury and his axe was notched on the iron collar of the forty-first Orc or Uruk. During the battle, Gimli saved Éomer's life by slaying two orcs and driving off two others that had ambushed the Marshal. Later, Gimli's vivid description of the Glittering Caves of Aglarond moved Legolas to promise to come back and visit when the War was over. (They eventually fulfilled this promise, with Gimli also consenting to visit Fangorn Forest.) Their friendship was a model for overcoming prejudice; they even rode together on the same horse. After their victory, Gimli and the others went to Saruman's stronghold of Isengard, where Gandalf cast Saruman out of the Order of Wizards and broke his staff. During this conversation, Gimli sees through Saruman's lies with the memorable quote 'This wizard's words stand on their heads' although Saruman does manage to grip the listeners one more time before Théoden finally enrages him enough to fully break the hold his voice has on them.
In the third volume, "The Return of the King", Gimli accompanied Aragorn, Legolas, a company of Rangers of the North, along with Elrond's sons on the Paths of the Dead, where at the stone of Erech Aragorn summoned the Dead Men of Dunharrow, shades bound to fight for the king of Gondor, which Aragorn rightfully was. Gimli witnessed the Dead Men rout enemy invaders at Pelargir in south Gondor by the power of fear alone. After Aragorn dismissed the shades, the menfolk of south Gondor gathered to his banner, and they all sailed in the enemy's abandoned ships to Gondor's capital Minas Tirith, which was then under siege. Their arrival eventually led to victory in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Gimli alone represented the Dwarves in the final battle against Sauron at the Black Gate of Mordor. He also recognized Peregrin Took's feet underneath a troll and saved the young hobbit's life. Before the host of Gondor could be overwhelmed, the Ring was destroyed, and Sauron was defeated.
After the War, Gimli led a large number of Durin's folk south to establish a new Dwarf-realm at Aglarond, and he became the first Lord of the Glittering Caves. The Dwarves of the Glittering Caves, led by their lord, repaired much of the physical damage incurred during the War. Most notably, they replaced the ruined Great Gate of Minas Tirith with a new one made of "mithril" and steel, as well as improving upon the existing layout of the entire city.
According to the Red Book of Westmarch, after Aragorn's death as King of the Reunited Kingdom in Fourth Age 120, Gimli (then very old) travelled with Legolas into the West, becoming the first Dwarf to visit the Undying Lands. This stemmed from his love for both Legolas and Lady Galadriel.
Adaptations.
Gimli was voiced by David Buck in Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated version of "The Lord of the Rings". Here he is drawn as being almost as tall as the rest of the non-hobbit members of the Fellowship.
Gimli does not appear in the 1980 animated version of "The Return of the King". He is portrayed by Tomi Salmela in the 1993 Finnish miniseries "Hobitit".
In Peter Jackson's movie trilogy (2001–2003) Gimli is played by John Rhys-Davies, who affected a Scottish accent in his portrayal. Rhys-Davies happened to be taller than the actors playing the Hobbits, who were only and while Rhys-Davies is . Thus in scenes where Gimli and the Hobbits appear together, their respective sizes remain in proportion, whereas in scenes where they have to interact with human-sized characters, tricks of scale had to be employed, especially since John Rhys-Davies is also taller than Viggo Mortensen and Orlando Bloom (who played Aragorn and Legolas respectively), both of whom are . Gimli wears a heavy helmet at the outset instead of getting one in Rohan as in the book, as well as wielding various axes of different shapes and uses (ex. small throwing axes, a walking axe, and a double-headed axe he obtains in Moria). In the book, he bears only one axe throughout.
In the movies, Gimli's more prosaic and blunt style contrasted to Aragorn and Legolas is somewhat exaggerated, and he often provides the defusing comic relief, with much of the humor based on heightism. Another major source of comic relief is his competitive, if friendly, feud with Legolas beginning in the course of ', which is well continued into ' where Gimli constantly finds himself out-achieved, especially when Legolas slays an Oliphaunt by himself. In the Hobbit movie series, Gimli is mentioned in "" when Legolas sees a medallion with pictures of Glóin's family and believes the image of young Gimli to be a goblin which infuriates the dwarf.
On stage, in the United States, Gimli was portrayed by Elizabeth Harris in the Cincinnati stage productions of "The Fellowship of the Ring" (2001), "The Two Towers" (2002), and "The Return of the King" (2003) for Clear Stage Cincinnati. At Chicago's Lifeline Theatre, Gimli was played on-stage by Brooks Darrah in "The Two Towers" (1999). In Canada, Gimli was portrayed by Ross Williams in the 3-hour Toronto stage production of "The Lord of the Rings", which opened in 2006. In The Lord of the Rings: The Musical he was played by Sévan Stephan throughout its London run.
Concept and creation.
The name "Gimli" first appeared in Tolkien's works in "The Tale of Tinúviel", the earliest version of the story of Beren and Lúthien Tinúviel, found in the second volume of "The Book of Lost Tales". Here, the name belongs to an aged Elf, a prisoner along with Beren in the kitchens of Tevildo, Prince of Cats (forerunner of Sauron).
During the writing of "The Lord of the Rings", as told in "The Return of the Shadow", Gimli's character was first named "Frar", then "Burin", and he was the son of Balin.

The Camadas de Guimarota, simply Guimarota, or Camadas de Alcobaça is a disused coal mine near the city of Leiria in central Portugal. An important geological formation dating back to the Kimmeridgian age of the Late Jurassic period, it contains a diverse array of fossil animals and plants, including dinosaurs and mammals.
The locality was extensively worked by paleontologists from the Free University of Berlin, but this activity stopped in 1982. Further excavations are considered to be unlikely, since the mine is now flooded. Pumping it out and rendering it safe again would be prohibitively expensive.
The mammal remains from this site are of particular note. The excavations were so successful that many of the recovered remains have yet to be studied.

Poundstock

Poundstock () is a civil parish and a hamlet on the north coast of Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The hamlet is situated four miles (6.5 km) south of Bude half-a-mile west of the A39 trunk road about one mile from the coast.
Poundstock civil parish is in the Registration District of Stratton. It is bounded to the west by the Atlantic Ocean; to the north by Marhamchurch parish, to the east by Week St Mary parish, and to the south by the parishes of Jacobstow and St Gennys. The population of the parish in the 2001 census was 805.
A free community magazine, "The Poundstock Packet", is produced every two months and distributed to every household in the parish.
Other buildings.
Penfound Manor.
Penfound manor house is built round a large medieval hall whose roof has collar-beams on arched braces. Additions to the hall are a massive chimney-stack in the north wall and a small room with solar above at the southwest corner. The windows are Tudor and the entrance porch has a granite doorway with an inscription of 1642. East of this are an inner hall which contains a 17th-century staircase, and a former dairy, built in Stuart times.
Rebel Cinema.
This relatively new cinema is situated just off the Atlantic Highway, and opened on 11 August 1988. Originally, the cinema site was a garden centre and café, but was purchased by the Collard family in 1986 to convert it into a cinema, as the nearest cinema to Bude was over 30 miles away in Wadebridge. It was built and designed by the film producer, Mervyn Collard (who produced actor David Jason's first film, "White Cargo". Mervyn died in 2004). Work started on the build at the end of 1987, and Westar 7000s projectors were installed, along with the carpets and seats and other fittings. The projectors were moved from the former Strand Cinema in Bideford, Devon. The architect was Martin Back.
The building frontage is in mock Greek style with a classical pediment, and two columns. The opening night film was a charity screening of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". Some changes have been made since opening, including the projectors now replaced with Cinemeccanica Victoria 9s, and the ticket office and foyer have been modified.
The Rebel was sold to Kaler Cinemas in 1991/1992 and subsequently sold to the Willis family in May 2000 who trade as Rebel Cinemas Limited to the present day. B A Willis has been involved in booking films for the Rebel Cinema since the early 1990s until taking over ownership and running in May 2000 in time for the opening of the film Saving Grace which was filmed locally in Cornwall at Port Isaac.
The Rebel closed in August 2007 and re-opened in August 2011 after an ambitious transformation and complete refurbishment took place to bring the Rebel up to date with comfort, screen size and the latest digital sound formats which was all achieved commercially without grants, funding, or any other form of local or national subsidies so as to retain its position as a commercially run full-time cinema.
The Rebel Cinema is currently in the process of upgrading to Digital 3D projection and also the addition of a second screen with seating for 96 in the near future.

Facts.
J Spurling Ltd had a warehouse in East London. Mr Andrew Bradshaw had eight barrels of orange juice. He asked Spurling Ltd to store them. In the contract was the "London lighterage clause" which exempted warehousemen from liability due to their negligence. When the barrels were collected, they were damaged. When Bradshaw refused to pay Spurling Ltd, the company sued for the cost. Bradshaw counterclaimed for damages for breach of an implied term of a contract of bailment to take reasonable care.
Judgment.
Denning, Morris and Parker LJ held that although the warehouse employees were negligent, the clause effectively exempted them. Denning LJ's judgment went as follows. Note that his reference to the concept of a fundamental breach precluding an exclusion of liability was rejected by the House of Lords some years later in "Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd" AC 827.

Torsten Lieberknecht

Torsten Lieberknecht (born 1 August 1973) is a retired German football player and manager currently in charge of Eintracht Braunschweig.
Career.
Lieberknecht began his senior career at 1. FC Kaiserslautern, where he made his Bundesliga debut on 26 August 1992 in a game against SG Wattenscheid 09. He left Kaiserslautern after the 1993–1994 season to join SV Waldhof Mannheim and went on to play a total of ten seasons in the 2. Bundesliga for Mannheim, 1. FSV Mainz 05 and Eintracht Braunschweig before retiring as a player in 2007.
Lieberknecht also represented Germany nine times at the U-21 level and was part of the German squad for the 1993 FIFA World Youth Championship in Australia.
Managing career.
After retiring as a player, Lieberknecht became a youth coach at his last club, Eintracht Braunschweig. At the end of the 2007–08 Regionalliga season the club was in serious danger of missing out on qualification for Germany's new nationwide third-tier league 3. Liga, which would have meant Braunschweig's first ever relegation to the fourth level of Germany's football league system. When Benno Möhlmann, at the time the manager of Eintracht Braunschweig's first team, stepped down in May 2008, Lieberknecht was named his successor. Under him the club not only secured 3. Liga qualification on the last match day of the season, but since then has started a steady climb back up the ladder of German football. In 2010–11 Lieberknecht and his team were promoted back into the 2. Bundesliga, and quickly established themselves at this level. After having finished the previous season comfortably midtable, the club was even more successful during the 2012–13 season and in the end won promotion to the Bundesliga. This marked Eintracht Braunschweig's return into Germany's top-flight after a 28 year absence. Lieberknecht was widely recognized in the German media as one of the key figures in the club's resurgence after years in the second and third tier.

Tomy Drissi

Tomy Drissi ( ; born December 9, 1958 in Hollywood, California) is an American stock and sports car racing driver, and an advertising executive in the movie industry. A long-time competitor in the Sports Car Club of America's Trans-Am Series, he was the series' 2009 Champion. Drissi currently competes in the American Le Mans Series for RSR Racing in the Prototype Challenge class; he also competes on a limited basis in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and Nationwide Series as a road course ringer.
Career.
Drissi first became involved in motorsports through his participation in illegal street racing, primarily on Mulholland Drive in Hollywood's Hollywood Hills, starting at the age of 16. He began legitimate competition in 1993, when he became involved in vintage racing, primarily at Willow Springs Raceway. Drissi's driving style proved "too aggressive" for the fragile vintage cars, and he moved to standard, modern race cars, making his debut in professional racing in 1999. Competing in the SCCA Trans-Am Series, Drissi won Rookie of the Year in his initial season. He would score his first win in the series the following year at the Long Beach Grand Prix. Competing in the series both before and after its mid-2000s hiatus, he won the first championship of the revitalized series in 2009.
Drissi also competed in the SCCA World Challenge series between 2006 and 2010; in 2003, he had begun competing in the sports cars of the American Le Mans Series, where he would make his primary effort in racing outside of Trans-Am; he currently drives in the series for RSR Racing, competing in the Prototype Challenge class, co-driving an Oreca FLM09 with Bruno Junqueira and Roberto González. , he has scored two class wins during his career in the series, both coming during the 2011 season at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course and at the Baltimore Grand Prix.
Drissi also competed in nine Rolex Sports Car Series events in 2005 and 2006, posting a best finish of ninth on the road course at Phoenix International Raceway in September 2005.
NASCAR.
In 2010, Drissi made his debut in stock car competition, driving the No. 82 Dodge Charger for MacDonald Motorsports in the NASCAR Nationwide Series, competing in the NAPA Auto Parts 200 at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal. He finished 18th in the event; the following year he would drive in two races in the Nationwide Series, driving the No. 75 Ford for Rick Ware Racing at Watkins Glen International, where he finished 27th, and at Montreal, finishing 34th. Drissi also competed in a single NASCAR K&N Pro Series West race in 2011 on the road course at Portland International Raceway, driving the No. 12 Toyota for Bill McAnally Racing; he would finish 22nd in the event.
Sprint Cup Series.
In 2011, established as a "road course ringer", Drissi was hired by Max Q Motorsports, which had entered into a partnership with Rick Ware Racing, to drive the team's No. 37 Ford, sponsored by the movie "Rise of the Planet of the Apes", in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series at the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Infineon Raceway. Drissi was not approved by NASCAR to compete in the event due to not having sufficient experience in the heavy Sprint Cup cars; Chris Cook substituted for Drissi, qualifying and driving the car in the event.
Drissi returned to Infineon (now known as Sonoma) for the 2012 Toyota/Save Mart 350, being hired to drive the No. 10 Chevrolet, sponsored by "", for Tommy Baldwin Racing. Drissi returned to Sonoma in the 2013 Toyota/Save Mart 350 for NEMCO-Jay Robinson Racing, driving the No. 87 Toyota sponsored by "The Wolverine", and drove again for the team at Watkins Glen International with sponsorship promoting "The Counselor".

Reel Pink

Reel Pink is the 13th cartoon produced in the "Pink Panther" series. A total of 124 6-minute cartoons were produced between 1964 and 1980.
Plot.
The Pink Panther goes fishing for an afternoon, and decides to stop first to purchase worms for bait. One worm, however, is reluctant to join the panther. The worm later tries to sabotage the panther's fishing trip by attaching the hook to the motor propeller of a nearby boat, and later cutting off the wire to the motor in the panther's own boat. 
The panther eventually catches a fighter that pulls him into the water. He finally pulls out his catch, revealing it as a crab. The panther ends up battling the angry crustacean, but when he is thrown down twice, he decides to end it and pulls out a shotgun. The crab hides in its shell as the panther aims. A gun snout appears from the crab's shell, and it proceeds to shoot at the frightened panther, who escapes on a motorboat.
Notability.
"Reel Pink" was one of several entries that would also be featured on "The Pink Panther Show" during bumper segments. Individual scenes would be utilized with a new soundtrack and off-screen narration supplied by Marvin Miller.
"The Pink Panther Show" contained a laugh track when the "Pink Panther" cartoons were broadcast on NBC-TV. Most American broadcasts currently air with the laugh track muted; however, "Reel Pink" airs with the original laugh track intact on the Spanish language Boomerang TV channel.

Jacqueline McGlade

Jacqueline Myriam McGlade (born May 30, 1955) is a British-born Canadian marine biologist and environmental informatics professor. Her research focusses on the spatial and nonlinear dynamics of ecosystems, climate change and scenario development.
She was Executive Director of the European Environment Agency from 2003-2013. Upon receiving this appointment she took leave from her post as Professor of Environmental Informatics in the Department of Mathematics at University College London.
Education.
Professor McGlade completed her BSc in Marine Biology, Biochemistry and Soil Science at the University College of North Wales, UK, in 1977. She obtained her PhD degree in 1980 on aquatic sciences and zoology from the University of Guelph in Canada. In 1987, she obtained a MA degree from the University of Cambridge in the UK.
Early career and research.
Spatial population dynamics.
McGlade’s PhD research on the mathematical and statistical analysis of the phenotypic and genotypic variability showed the critical importance of spatial dynamics in determining evolutionary divergence and ecological sustainability in freshwater and marine fish populations. This work led to her establishing the first population dynamics and genetics laboratory in Fisheries and Oceans Canada.
Her subsequent research at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography laboratory helped move existing fisheries assessment methodologies from logistic models of population growth to spatially extended predator-prey, or Lotka-Volterra type models. She has also created the basis for a new research activity to become established at the Bedford Institute in spatial modelling and artificial intelligence to apply space-based observations to biological oceanography.
After developing fleet deployment models at the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the USA) and working on ecological networks with researchers at the intelligence systems laboratory at Xerox PARC, Professor McGlade continued her research in systematics, ichthyology and population dynamics in Cambridge as the Adrian Fellow at Darwin College during the period 1987-1990. At the same time, she expanded her research in coastal issues at the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Study in the Netherlands and the Cranfield Institute in the UK, where she worked to develop spatial models for environmental issues.
Theoretical ecology, ecosystems and policy.
From 1988 onwards, Professor McGlade focussed her research on theoretical ecology to study short and long-term changes in ecosystems at FZ Jülich research centre and RWTH Aachen University in Germany. She and her research staff applied their knowledge of dynamical systems, especially in the area of spatial dynamics (differential equations, coupled-map lattices, cellular automata and individual based models) to study the behaviour ecosystems.
In 1992, she accepted a post at the University of Warwick. The ideas and theories developed during the following ten years led to significant insights into the role of evolutionarily stable attractors, invasion exponents and phenotype dynamics in a wide range of ecosystems, including the African savannah, marine communities, annual and perennial plants and forests and red grouse.
She was briefly Director of NERC's Center for Coastal and Marine Science, resigning after less than two years in post with the Centre being disbanded shortly after
With her appointment as NERC Professorial Fellow at University College London in 2000, her work field extended to environmental policy in areas as diverse as waste, pollution, air quality and biodiversity.
She is a member of the Advisory Council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering.
European Environment Agency.
Professor McGlade was appointed Executive Director to the European Environment Agency in 2003 for a five-year term. The appointment was renewed in May 2008 for a second term, ending May 31, 2013.
At the EEA, Professor McGlade introduced a shift in environmental reporting and indicator development towards a shared European spatial environmental information system. Such information system aimed to bring together key aspects of national and international research outputs including those from the Copernicus programme, previously known as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) initiative.
Under her leadership, the Agency sought to reinforce its capability to produce integrated environmental assessments, analyse the state of Europe’s environment as a whole, and provide reliable projections. Professor McGlade worked to strengthen the link between science and policy. She pointed at the magnitude of climate change and urged policymakers to start developing and applying adaptation measures.
McGlade was a firm advocate of informing and involving the public in all aspects of the environment. To this end, she strove to strengthen the information and feedback channels between researchers, public and policymakers, making environmental information understandable and accessible through technological media.
In conjunction with her role at the EEA, McGlade promoted environmental issues in European and international fora, including various UN committees, European Agencies and Environment Protection Agencies networks, and as well as a number of research, institutional and non-governmental advisory committees. McGlade is a member of several technology and environment advisory and honorary boards, including the Open Geospatial Consortium.

Henri Max Corwin (Cohen)

Henri Max Corwin (1903, Oldenzaal, Overijssel – January 1962) was a Dutch businessman, philatelist and humanitarian. He became famous both for his efforts to shield Jewish victims of Nazi persecution during World War II, and later for his efforts to document instruments of propaganda utilized during national conflict.
Biography.
Henri Max Cohen was born in 1903, the youngest of four children, in the eastern Netherlands village of Oldenzaal, where his family had lived since at least 1770. After completing secondary schooling Cohen entered the study of Law at Leiden University, but soon had to return to Oldenzaal to run the family business when his father suffered health problems.
As a youth Cohen had two abiding pastimes, stamp collecting and the theater. He wrote plays, directed plays and acted in plays.
When the persecution of Jewish people in Germany became apparent in the years before the outbreak of World War II, he began escorting people from that nation to safe havens in the Netherlands. He was often assisted in these trips by his fianceé Geraldine.
Soon after the start of the war, his nation was invaded and occupied by German troops. At that time, he became active in providing hiding places for people who would otherwise be arrested and deported under the German antisemitism policies. For this effort, he was arrested on 16 October 1943 by two Dutch members of the Sicherheitsdienst, on the charge of providing "safe houses". He was sentenced to imprisonment at Assen, but while being transported there, he managed to jump from the train and escape. He remained in hiding until the end of the war, after which he returned to Oldenzaal and resumed managing his family's affairs.
During the Cold War fears of the 1950s, he noted a renewed antisemitism in Europe. He saw many of the Dutch Jews moving to safe areas (usually America), and considered moving his family away also. In the end, he decided to remain in the Netherlands, but changed his name (and thus the family's name) from "Cohen" to "Corwin", hoping that this would buy them a margin of safety if anti-Jewish persecution did resume.
Henri died in January 1962 at the age of 58. A street in Oldenzaal was named in his honor.
Humanitarian efforts.
In the 1930s when the situation for the Jews in Germany became unbearable, he acted as a courier for the Jewish Refugee Committee in Amsterdam, taking refugees or their belongings across the Dutch border. For this he was granted membership in the U.N.A.P.E.F. (Union Nationale des Passeurs & Filieristes Benevoles). A letter from Albert Einstein confirms these activities (a copy is shown on the site). When in 1940 the Germans occupied the Netherlands and began arresting Jewish citizens, Cohen organized (in cooperation with the Resistance) hiding places for family and friends. This illegal activity led to his arrest by the SD (the Sicherheits Dienst) in 1943. On the way to prison he managed to escape and went into hiding himself until the end of the war.
In the early fifties, when Russian politics threatened European peace, many Dutch Jews fled the country. Mr. Cohen thought best to protect his family by changing his name in Corwin, a name several of his family living in the States already had adopted.
Genealogy efforts.
In his later years Corwin became an enthusiastic historian and genealogist. He tracked down family trees of Jewish families and gave lectures on the ups and downs of the Jewish population in the Twente region. The results of this research can be found in the Central Institute for Genealogy in The Hague, in the Rosentaliana Library and the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam, in periodicals, newspapers and the Yearbook Twente 1962. In 1960 he received the Order of Oranje Nassau.
Corwin died of heart failure at the age of 58 in January 1962. In Oldenzaal a street is named after him.
Detailed information with regard to the collection of H.M. Corwin and his interesting life, including his war diary, photo albums, press articles and more can be found on the personal site, created by his daughters in 2008. A book about his life will appear in 2009.
Collection of documents.
Corwin assembled a unique collection of documents regarding the Second World War and the Holocaust. Most of the collected items can be categorized under the title of "propaganda". This war collection contains 24 albums on various aspects of the period from approximately 1900 until 1945, including the rise of nationalism, the 1936 Olympic Games, Nazi occupation of various countries, anti-Semitic measures and the massacre of the Jews. The collection was exhibited in 1959/1964 in the Netherlands and in Israel at the Yad Vashem and at the Kibbutz Lohamei Hagethaot.
The Color of Propaganda.
These red pages are in no way related to one specific country or ideology, although on first glance it is very easy to recognize in them the signs of national-socialist Germany or communist Russia. In reality, propaganda has many colours and shades: red, brown, orange, green, blue, and not to mention black and even white. Its main aim is to manipulate the minds of the masses. It uses rhetoric, memorable images (books, children...), concepts that are difficult to argue against (fidelity, honesty, kindness, brotherhood...), the notion of a common destiny and of the ultimate goal, and most importantly a charismatic leader who is capable of enticing, stupefying and getting the people to follow him.
The six pages of comparative analysis presented here are only a small, yet nevertheless the most demonstrative example of the documents that constitute this unique collection. They are the concise guide to the methods of propaganda – the recipe for the poisonous potion commonly known as Propaganda. You will find here all the necessary ingredients: the need for order and stability, democracy and demonstration of the “will of the people”, power and greatness, history (the older the better, and it must always be legendary), most definitely a book (though of course, there is only one book- The Book!), and let us not forget the heroes, the martyrs and the spiteful enemies.
Unfortunately, the majority of the documents and facts presented in this collection are not so easy to identify. In this lies their main strength as propaganda items and also their greatest danger, the danger of which the creator of this collection – Henri-Max Corwin – wanted to warn future generations. When studying the documents within this collection, it is crucial to always remember the terrible lessons of history, the price one must pay for gullibility and for the reluctance to analyse and think.

Ralph Hasenhüttl

Ralph Hasenhüttl (born 9 August 1967) is an Austrian football manager and former player. He is currently the coach of FC Ingolstadt 04 in the 2. Bundesliga.
Playing career.
After several successful years playing as a centre-forward in the Austrian league, Hasenhüttl moved abroad, with spells at KV Mechelen and Lierse SK in Belgium. In season 1998–99, he signed for 1. FC Köln, for a fee equivalent to €200,000. In his two years in Cologne, however, he only scored three goals and in 2000 moved to SpVgg Greuther Fürth.
Hasenhüttl finished his career at FC Bayern Munich II, in the Regionalliga Süd.
International career.
Hasenhüttl played eight times for the Austrian national team, scoring three goals.
Managerial career.
Between 2004 and 2005, Hasenhüttl was a youth-team coach at SpVgg Unterhaching. Following the sacking of Harry Deutinger in March 2007, he became caretaker manager until the appointment of Werner Lorant, under whom he worked as assistant coach. Following the resignation of Lorant in October 2007, Hasenhüttl became the new head coach and finished in sixth place that season. In season 2008–09, in the newly formed 3. Liga, the team's performances earned them fourth place in the table, missing out on a play-off place by only one point. In the 2009–10 season, however, they failed to build upon their success, achieving only 31 points in 24 games, resulting in Hasenhüttl's sacking in February 2010.
In January 2011, Hasenhüttl succeeded Rainer Scharinger as the coach of third-division VfR Aalen, then in 16th place, one point above the relegation zone. Aalen's survival in the 3. Liga earned him a year's contract extension. In the 2011–12 season, he completely rebuilt the team, bringing in eight new players and releasing 14, with the aim of a mid-table finish. After a slow start to the season, the team found itself in sixth place at the winter break, only a point behind the play-off position. The team's run continued into the second half of the season, which included an eight-game winning streak, earning Hasenhüttl a further two-year contract extension in November 2011. At the end of the season, Aalen finished in second place, earning automatic promotion to the 2. Bundesliga.
During pre-season training in the summer of 2012, Hasenhüttl contracted a Hantavirus infection, but returned to work three weeks into the 2012–13 season. Hasenhüttl had switched from a 4–4–2 to a 4–5–1 formation, to facilitate a fast, counter-attacking game, with surprising success – by the winter break, Aalen were in fifth place. The team finished the season in ninth place, the highest of the newly promoted teams.
After two-and-a-half successful years at Aalen, Hasenhüttl resigned in June 2013, following disagreements with sporting director Markus Schupp, who had imposed an austerity program for the following season, with several departing players not being replaced.
In October 2013, Hasenhüttl was appointed as coach of FC Ingolstadt 04.

2008–09 Lega Basket Serie A

The Serie A FIP 2008-09 was the 87th edition of the top-level Italian basketball championship.
The 16 participating teams played each other team in home and away matches. At the end of the regular season, the first eight classified teams advanced to a championship play-off, while the last two were relegated in LegADue. The original number of teams was 18, but on September 20, 2008 the Federal Council of the Italian Basketball Federation (FIP) discovered administrative irregularities committed by Basket Napoli and UPEA Capo d'Orlando and decided to deny them professional licenses. The council also chose not to substitute them with any teams from LegADue, and at the same time decided to permanently reduce the number of teams in the top flight to 16.
Montepaschi Siena swept virtually all before them domestically, winning the SuperCoppa Italiana before the season and the Coppa Italia at midseason, losing in the league only once (at Fortitudo Bologna), and going unbeaten through the playoffs to claim their third straight title.
Supercoppa Italiana.
The Italian Supercup is played as a single match before the start of the season between the previous year's Serie A champion and Coppa Italia winner (if a club wins both, the match instead pits the top two teams from the previous season's league). This season, the game, played September 30 in Siena, pitted two-time defending league champion Montepaschi Siena against Coppa Italia winner Air Avellino.
Terrell McIntyre was named MVP of the game.
Standings.
At end of regular season:
Following the season, the owner of Fortitudo (GMAC) Bologna failed to make required payments to remain in the Italian professional ranks, and the club were further relegated to the country's third level, the nominally amateur Serie A Dilettanti. An appeal was unsuccessful.
Coppa Italia.
The top eight teams at the halfway point of the regular season (15 rounds) competed in the Italian Cup, seeded according to their league placement at that time. The cup tournament was held at Futurshow Station in Casalecchio di Reno from February 19 to February 22, 2009, with top seed Montepaschi Siena winning the cup for the first time.
Playoffs.
The playoffs, which began on May 18, featured the top eight teams from regular-season play, seeded by league position. The quarterfinal and semifinal rounds were best-of-five, while the final expanded for the first time from its traditional best-of-five format to best-of-seven.

Cléo Dubois

Cléo Dubois was an early member of the San Francisco Leather community and is now a BDSM educator, writer, documentarian, ritualist, and personal trainer in the kinky arts. Known for her fiery style and body-spirit-heart connection, she's become one of the most respected of the early practitioners.
Dubois is a guest lecturer or teacher at the Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality, Society of Janus, The Exiles - San francisco, an invited speaker at San Francisco State University, and University of California, Berkeley.
Early life.
Born in Paris, Dubois was raised Catholic. Raised in an oppressive patriarchal family that was filled with classical music and opera. Her family was also quite homophobic and held right wing political values. 
Late in her teens she rejected her families values and those of the church. She left France for San Francisco. Once there she studied dancing and improvisational theatre at the Blake Street Hawkeyes. Through her work in theater, she started to connect with her desire for empowerment and dominance.
BDSM Player & Ethical Domina.
Cléo started her kinky life by attending the first Dominant Woman class taught by Kat Sunlove, joining the Society of Janus in 1981, as well as attending many San Francisco Leather classes taught by Gayle Rubin, Patrick Califia, and Alan Selby. She became a volunteer bottom as she was a part of the tradition that required experiencing something before doing it to others. Within a year of her coming out LIL (living in leather conferences) and soon was participating in panel discussions at such community gatherings. 1984 She joined the Outcasts and was the first door keeper of that social leather women organization. For her SM became a way to transcend the grief of all the deaths in the community from AIDS. In contrast to her oppressive patriarchal upbringing she embraced the leather subculture and supported gay rights. 
Dubois was an early proponent of "Consensual Informed Erotic Power Play". With her friend Sybil Holiday she established a respected presence in the professional Dominant scene following the steps of Janus founder Cynthia Slater.
Ritualist.
As a body ritual enthusiast, along with her life partner, Fakir Musafar, she conducts Spirit + Flesh shamanic ritual/workshops. She describes it as "a personal dance of ecstatic fire" and a way to experience a larger deeper reality and facilitate healing from abuse and traumas.
Educator.
Dubois founded the Academy of SM Arts in 1995 in response to the growing need for a safe place to learn and explore BDSM from an experienced professional as many misconceptions and misinformation were being spread around.
In 2002, Dubois started leading erotic dominance intensives for women, with her partner Sybil Holiday. This workshop was designed to help those with some BDSM experience to increase their skills, gain confidence and expand their range of choices within a scene. Two years later she added a workshop for men.
She teaches three different intensives for men, women, and professionals with her co-teachers, Eve Minax and Selina Raven, as well as guest faculty from the community, including JD of the Two Knotty Boys.
Documentarian.
In 2000, Dubois, produced a docu-film on erotic energy exchange in the dungeon. 
Premiered at Frameline film festival in 2001 and screened at New york Cinekink in 2001 followed by screening in Paris. The Village Voice remarked on the tangible caring connection between Cléo and her submissive.

Richard Mortensen

Richard Mortensen (born 23 October 1910 in Copenhagen, Denmark; died 6 January 1993 in Ejby, Denmark) was a Danish painter.
Mortensen studied between 1931 and 1932 at the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen. Influenced by the works of Wassily Kandinsky, he developed an abstract style. In Copenhagen, Mortensen was joint founder of the "Linien" school of abstract painters.
In 1937, he undertook a study trip to Paris, where he met pioneers of surrealism, such as Roger Vitrac, Gala Éluard, Michel Leiris, Antonin Artaud, Raymond Queneau and André Masson. During the Second World War, Mortensen's works reflected the violence of Europe. He moved to Paris in 1947, remaining there until 1964. Together with Robert Jacobsen, Mortensen became connected to the Galerie Denise René in Paris, which became famous for concrete art. His later works are concrete works of art characterised by large, clear, bright colour surfaces.
Mortensen was awarded the Edvard Munch Prize in 1946, and the Kandinsky prize in 1950, and the Thorvaldsen medal in 1968. After his return to Denmark in 1964, he received a Professorship at the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen, which he held until 1980.

St Blazey Gate

St Blazey Gate () is a settlement in south Cornwall, United Kingdom in the civil parish of St Blaise. It is situated between the towns of St Blazey and Par on the A390 to St Austell.
The settlement formed around a toll gate on the turnpike road to St Austell. The toll house is now a private residence.
St Mary's Church is the parish church of Church of England parish of Par. It was built on land given Edward Carlyon the owner of the nearby Tregrehan House and was consecrated on 1 November 1849. It was designed by George Edmund Street, his first commission, and built from the local reddish coloured Biscovey slate with quoins from Pentewan stone from the cliffs near Mevagissey.
The Biscovey Stone is the shaft of an ancient Celtic cross. It was inscribed but the text is no longer readable. There are several theories about the stone, one says it dates from around 600 AD to show the Saxon advance into the county, another puts the date at around 900 AD. The head is thought to have been removed during the reformation. The stone served as a gate post near the St Blazey turnpike gate. In 1896 it was moved to St Mary's Church.

Flag of Pembrokeshire

The flag of Pembrokeshire is the flag of the Welsh county of Pembrokeshire.
The flag was designed by Councillors Peter Stock, Dewi Pritchard, Jim Brock and Marjorie Jacobs in the 1970s after the abolition of Pembrokeshire County Council. It was registered by the Flag Institute in 1988. A statement by Peter Stock, 'The flag was dedicated as the official flag of Pembrokeshire, at Pembroke Castle at a ceremony on 28 July 1988 with a march past by the band of The Queen's Dragoons Guards.' The ceremony was recorded for posterity.
Joffre Swales, founder and conductor of the Haverfordwest Town Band wrote a march entitled "The Pembrokeshire Flag" for the band to perform on marches around the county.
__TOC__
Flag design.
The Pembrokeshire Flag is based on the flag of St David. (The saint's birthplace, the city of St David's, is in Pembrokeshire.) The blue is also considered to be reminiscent of the sea, and the yellow of summer sunshine. The central rose represents the red Tudor Rose, a symbol used by King Henry VII, who founded the Tudor dynasty; a man of both Welsh and English descent who was born in Pembroke Castle. The green pentagon around the rose symbolises the green fields and cliff-tops of Pembrokeshire.
The pantone colours for the flag are:

Anthony John Moses

Anthony John Moses (born 12 October 1942, in Newport) is a Welsh scientist, researcher and professor, former director of Wolfson Centre for Magnetics.
Education.
Moses completed his BEngTech 1st Class Honours in 1961. After gaining a First Class honours degree in Electrical Engineering at University of Wales, Institute of Science and Technology (UWIST) in 1966, he worked as a design engineer at GKN Birwelco Limited. 
He returned to the university and carried out a PhD studies at UWIST, where he graduated in 1970.
Further career.
After gaining the PhD degree he started to work for Wolfson Centre for the Technology of Soft Magnetic Materials, at the time directed by Prof. Jack. E. Thompson. At the Wolfson Centre Moses proceeded as a Research Fellow, Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Reader and finally a Professor. He was awarded Doctor of Science by the University of Wales in 1990.
As a director of the Wolfson Centre.
In the same year Prof. Thompson retired and Prof. Moses became the new Director of the Wolfson Centre. In 2001 the Wolfson Centre was awarded the status of the European Centre of Excellence.
During his directorship the Wolfson Centre carried out experimental and educational activity in the field of soft magnetic materials, in particular the measurement of magnetic properties, modelling of the phenomena and processes occurring in magnetic materials applied in electrical machines. 
He participated in realization of government and industrial research contracts. In the last 10 years of his directorship he supervised contracts valued at over 5 million pounds. Within the period 1998–2000 he was the Chairman of Steering Committee of Materials Forum in Wales, member of several scientific societies (e.g. IEE and IEEE), member of Steering Group and Editorial Boards of several scientific conferences (e.g. Soft Magnetic Materials Conference and International Workshop on 1 & 2 Dimensional Magnetic Measurement and Testing). His teaching experience comprises the coordination of two Tempus Projects. He also directed teaching schemes of postgraduate studies and PhD studies in electrical engineering and magnetic materials technology at Cardiff University, supervised over 50 PhD students and of 60 higher degree projects, organised short courses and open days at the Wolfson Centre.
Moses published over 200 research papers in professional international journals on magnetics technology. He presented numerous invited papers and lectures at conferences in the UK and many countries worldwide, including: USA, Japan, Korea, France, Spain, Italy, Greece, Germany, Russia, Poland, Sweden, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Hungary.
In 2000 Moses was introduced to Queen Elizabeth II, who visited Cardiff University.
Co-operation with Poland.
Under Moses directorship the Wolfson Centre co-operated closely with the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of Lublin University of Technology, Poland in 1980s and 1990s. The partnership resulted in numerous scientific papers, staff mobility and student exchange programmes. Several other international partners were participating, including South Bank University, London and Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Braunschweig. All this contributed to obtaining the status of the European Centre of Excellence for the Application of Superconducting and Plasma Technologies in Power Engineering (ASPPECT) based at the Institute of Electrical Engineering and Electrotechnologies of Lublin University of Technology.
Wolfson Centre also collaborated with other Polish universities: Częstochowa University of Technology and Wrocław University of Technology.
Doctor Honoris Causa.
In 2003 Lublin University of Technology celebrated its 50th anniversary. Using the occasion the Senate of the University approved the opinion elaborated by Prof. Bolesław Mazurek on the scientific, educational and organisational output of Prof. Moses and promoted the title of Doctor Honoris Causa of Lublin University of Technology to Prof. Anthony John Moses on 14 May 2003, after the Senate resolution No 40/3/2002-2005.

Hashem Mahameed (; , born 18 February 1945) is a former Israeli politician who served as a member of the Knesset for Hadash, Balad, United Arab List and National Unity – National Progressive Alliance between 1990 and 2003.
Biography.
Born in Umm al-Fahm during the Mandate era, Mahameed studied education at the Hadassim Teachers' Seminary and Tel Aviv University, gaining a BA and an MA.
A former mayor of his home city, Mahameed first entered the Knesset on 10 January 1990 on the Hadash list as a replacement for the long-serving Meir Vilner. He was re-elected in 1992, and again in 1996, by which time Hadash were running on a joint list with Balad. On 8 March 1999, shortly before Knesset elections, Mahameed joined Balad, which left its alliance with Hadash.
However, he did not contest the elections on the Balad list, instead winning third place on the United Arab List list. On 10 December 2002 he left the United Arab List and established a new faction, National Unity – National Progressive Alliance (later renamed Progressive National Alliance). The party ran in the 2003 elections with Mahameed as its head, resulting in him losing his seat.

<doc id="20599741" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20599741" title="Volcanic passive margin">
Volcanic passive margin

Volcanic passive margins (VPM) and non-volcanic passive margins are the two forms of transitional crust that lie beneath passive continental margins that occur on Earth as the result of the formation of ocean basins via continental rifting. Initiation of igneous processes associated with volcanic passive margins occurs before and/or during the rifting process depending on the cause of rifting. There are two accepted models for VPM formation: hotspots/mantle plumes and slab pull. Both result in large, quick lava flows over a relatively short period of geologic time (i.e. a couple of million years). VPM’s progress further as cooling and subsidence begins as the margins give way to formation of normal oceanic crust from the widening rifts.
Characteristics.
Despite the differences in origin and formation, most VPMs share the same characteristics: 
Development.
[[Image:VPMStage 2.png|right|thumb|Not to scale Other melts caused by convection related upwelling form reservoirs of magma from which dike swarms and sills eventually radiate to the surface, creating the characteristic seaward dipping lava flows. This model is controversial.
Passive rifting.
The passive rift model infers that slab pull stretches the lithosphere and thins it. To compensate for lithospheric thinning, asthenosphere upwells, melts due to adiabatic decompression, and derivative melts rise to the surface to erupt. Melts push up through faults towards the surface, forming dikes and sills.
Development of transitional crust.
Continued extension leads to accelerated igneous activity, including repeated eruptions. Repeated eruptions form a thick sequence of lava beds that can reach a combined thickness of up to 20 km. These beds are identified on seismic refraction sections as seaward dipping reflectors. It is important to note that the early phase of volcanic activity is not limited to the production of basalts. Rhyolite and other felsic rocks can also be found in these zones.
Continued extension with volcanic activity forms transitional crust, welding ruptured continent to nascent ocean floor. Volcanic beds cover the transition from thinned continental crust to oceanic crust. Also occurring during this phase is the formation of high velocity seismic zones under the thinned continental crust and the transition crust. These zones are identified by typical seismic velocities between 7.2-7.7 km/s and are usually interpreted as layers of mafic to ultramafic rocks that have underplated the transitional crust.
Asthenospheric upwelling leads to the formation of a mid-ocean ridge and new oceanic crust progressively separates the once-conjoined rift halves. Continued volcanic eruptions spread lava flows across transitional crust and onto oceanic crust. Due to the high rate of magmatic activity the new oceanic crust forms much thicker than typical oceanic crust. An example of this is Iceland where oceanic crust has been identified as being up to 40 km thick. Some have theorized that the copious amounts of volcanic material also lead to the formation of oceanic plateaus at this time.
Post-rift.
The final and longest phase is the continued thermal subsidence of the transitional crust and the accumulation of sediments. Continued seafloor spreading leads to the formation of oceanic crust of normal thickness. Over time this production of normal oceanic crust and sea floor spreading leads to the formation of an ocean. This phase is of the most interest to the oil industry and sedimentary geologists.
Distribution and examples.
The distribution of known volcanic margins is shown on the graphic to the right. Many of the margins have not been thoroughly investigated and more passive margins are identified as volcanic from time to time.
Volcanic passive margins:
Example of volcanic passive margin.
The US Atlantic passive margin extends from Florida to southern Nova Scotia. It is the result of the breakup of the supercontinent, Pangea, when North America separated from northwestern Africa and Iberia to form the Atlantic Ocean.
The central eastern North American continental shelf is one of the world’s largest volcanic passive margins. It extends from the Carolina Trough to the Scotia Basin. It has a typical history of tectonic events that are representative of volcanic passive margins such as rifting, breakup and seafloor spreading. Rifting and passive margin formation occurred 225-165 million years ago. It includes characteristic seaward-dipping reflectors, flood basalts, dikes, and sills.
Like other volcanic passive margins, it developed in two stages. First came rifting, initiated during the Middle to Late Triassic and continued into Jurassic time.
The second stage involved seafloor spreading, which began in Jurassic time and continues today. This is when North America separated from Africa to form the Atlantic Ocean.

Cash in My Pocket

"Cash in My Pocket"is a 2008 single from British grime artist Wiley, which features guest vocals from Daniel Merriweather and was produced by Mark Ronson.
Reviews.
Clickmusic.com gave the song 2 stars out of 5 but gave it some praise by saying "Releasing a song entitled Cash in My Pocket during a full blown credit crunch is timing par excellence" but went onto saying that "a bored sounding Merriweather delivers his perfunctory contribution with nothing of the soul that we have come to expect".
Yahoo Music gave the song 8 stars out of 10, they had this to say about Wiley, "delivers his lines with a twinkle in his eye", they then went on to say this about the chorus which was sung by Daniel Merriweather, "while the chorus could be lifted from a West End musical", they then finished the review by saying, "This is contemporary pop working at full speed".
Femalefirst.co.uk gave the song 4 stars out of 5, because it lets the viewers vote and that is the average as of 3 January 2008, they praised the song by saying that it is, "Entering ground-breaking new musical territory", they also talked about the credit crunch when they said "Wiley has read the mood of a nation hit by the global economic crises and has come up with an ode to the credit crunch of sorts".
Competition.
Glasswerk.co.uk made a competition where people could make their own video for the song with their classmates or colleagues and get "£1000 worth of XmasCa$h In Your Pocket", they also called the song "the official credit crunch theme tune".
Music video.
The video is like the video for "Wearing My Rolex" in the aspect that it does not feature Wiley or Daniel Merriweather: it has the people featured in the video miming the lyrics. It starts off with people going to work in their car in the financial district of Bishopsgate, in the City of London, while the rest of the music video is set in one of the offices in the Blue Fin Building in Southwark, London (located at 110 Southwark Street, post code SE1 0SU, directly behind the Tate Modern). The office is the UK Headquarters of Donovan Data Systems (DDS), a "leading systems and software provider to the advertising industry", and the video features the people who work there.
One can see pictures on the London Eye on the glass walls in the music video. It then ends with everyone who works there singing the last lines of the song.
Chart performance.
The song debut on the UK Singles Chart at 18, making it Wiley's second biggest hit since his 2008 number 2 hit "Wearing My Rolex" and Daniel's second biggest hit since his number 2 collaboration with Mark Ronson entitled "Stop Me", on this week it was the third biggest new entry of the week behind Oasis "I'm Outta Time" (12) and Leona Lewis "Run" (1). The following week the song dropped one place to number 19, James Morrison and Nelly Furtado's new single "Broken Strings" took number 18 from Wiley and Merriweather. The next week it dropped nine places to 28, the following week it dropped thirteen places in the chart to 41, this was its first week outside of the top 40.
The video is set on a trading floor in what is to be the Swiss Re building (Gherkin Building). This can be clearly seen when the car initially pulled up outside and the camera pans upwards.

Ailleurs are the transcripts of a series of interviews between Jean-Louis Ezine and the French Nobel laureate J. M. G. Le Clézio.
Short summary.
"Ailleurs" (French for "Elsewhere") reads like a meandering conversation where Le Clézio gets to talk about his childhood, his dreams, where he prefers to do his writing as well as aviation and how he escapes from the everyday.
Some of the themes expanded in these interviews are:
According to the publisher,the interviews lead to a book which is " an opus on thinking and on poetry" and which uses "broad strokes using mythological colors to tell his story".The storyline of this book is definitely what the French call " Ailleurs" meaning somewhere else.

Charles Webb Murphy (born Wilmington, Ohio - died October 16, 1931 in Chicago, Illinois) was the owner of the Chicago Cubs of the National League from through . Originally a sportswriter for the "Cincinnati Enquirer" and the "Cincinnati Times-Star", Murphy joined the New York Giants front office in 1905. After the 1905 season, Murphy purchased the Cubs from Jim Hart, in a bid financed by a loan from Charles Phelps Taft, owner of the "Enquirer". Murphy repaid the loan in full with the profits from the 1906 season.
It was under Murphy's ownership that the Cubs won the franchise's only two World Series titles, in 1907 and 1908. After several years as Cubs owner, Murphy became a disliked figure amongst other owners in the National League, the press, and his players. He sold the Cubs to Charles Phelps Taft after the 1913 season.
Murphy also held a 50% stake in the Baker Bowl, the former home field of the Philadelphia Phillies, which was sold to him by fomer Phillies owner Horace Fogel in 1912.
After leaving baseball, Murphy returned to Wilmington, Ohio and financed the construction of the Murphy Theatre.

Rov

Rov () is a Talmudic concept which means the "majority".
It is based on the passage in Exodus 23;2: "after the majority to wrest" (אחרי רבים להטות), which in Rabbinic interpretation means, that you shall accept things as the majority.
The most original practice of that term is by a Sanhedrin meeting, where the opinion of the majority is the final law.
The term applies also to accidental mixtures of Kosher and non-Kosher ingredients, when the non-kosher can be nullified be the majority of the kosher (some restrictions apply to this halacha).

Confédération générale du travail de Guadeloupe

Confédération générale du travail de Guadeloupe ('General Confederation of Labour of Guadeloupe') is a trade union centre in Guadeloupe. CGTG was founded in 1962, as the Guadeloupean federation of the French "Confédération générale du travail" became an independent centre. CGTG is particularly strong amongst banana plantation workers and in the Basse-Terre area.
Historically, CGTG is linked to the Guadeloupe Communist Party (PCG). In 1965, CGTG began publishing "Tribune Ouvrière" ('Workers' Tribune).
In 2000, the PCG party congress adopted a new line of action, calling for street protests, strikes and civil disobedience in order to pressure the French state to allow a new stature for Guadeloupe. The PCG congress also stated that the party would support trade union struggles, even if not directly led by the party. These adjustments opened up for more cooperation between CGTG and the independentist trade union centre UGTG.
In January 2002, a member of the Trotskyist group "Combat Ouvrier", Jean-Marie Nomertin, was elected General Secretary of CGTG at a meeting of the CGTG Executive Committee. A deal was struck between militants of PCG and "Combat Ouvrier". Nomertin, previously general secretary of "CGTG-Banane", succeeded PCG militant Claude Morvan. Morvan had been the general secretary 1975-2002. Before Morvan, Hermann Songeons was the general secretary of CGTG.
In the 2002 election to the Guadelopean Joint Industrial Tribunal, CGTG came second with 15 out of 48 seats. 28% of employees participated in the vote. In 2008, CGTG won 14 seats.
As of 2003, CGTG was estimated to have 5,000 members.
In December 2008, CGTG took part in organizing a general strike in Guadeloupe, along with other trade union centres, political parties and social movements, gathered in Liyannaj Kont Pwofitasyon. The strike was organized in order to demand lowering of petrol prices and increase of wages.

Plot.
The Little Man and his Little dog are out camping one night, unaware that the Pink Panther is sleeping on a tree branch just above them. Due to the Little Man's snoring, the panther cannot sleep, so he cuts loose the man's hammock with a knife, sending him flying straight to the river. When the dog hears the man's scream for help, he grips the knife in his mouth, and seeing this, the man blames the dog for what has happened. Later, the panther does various other things to avert the man's snoring, such as attaching the little man's hammock above the campfire, and sending the tent with the man in it floating down the river towards a waterfall. Despite the dog trying to help, the man blames him for every one of these mishaps and eventually, the two engage in a fight. While wrestling with a rifle, they accidentally shoot down the branch the Panther was sleeping on and angrily chase him as he goes to find somewhere else to sleep.

[[Image:engels hobbitt.jpg|thumb|right|Engels' design for the dustjacket
Richard 'Horus' Engels (1914–1991) was a German painter, sculptor and illustrator. 
Engels was born in London, England to German parents. In his youth Engels lived in Berlin and studied in Paris. He trained to be an economist and worked in the great Siemens factory, but then became an artist, and gained the nickname "Horus" by which he became known in artistic circles. 
During World War II he served in the Wehrmacht and was captured by the Russian Army. After the war he moved to Wolfsburg where he met his Dutch wife, with whom he had a son and a daughter. 
Engels put much detail and coloration in his illustration, as can be seen in his ten pictures for the tales of the Brothers Grimm. His studio was in the Castle Neuhaus near Wolfsburg. Engels was the Chairman of ISC (International Subud Committee) in 1971-75, and then Chairman of SICA (Subud International Cultural Association) in 1983-89.
In 1946 Richard Engels contacted J. R. R. Tolkien for a German edition of "The Hobbit" and sent him two illustrations of the Trolls and Gollum, which Tolkien found "too Disnified". In 1957 the German publishing company Paulus-Verlag published the first German translation of "The Hobbit" by Walter Scherf as "Kleiner Hobbit und der große Zauberer" in which Engels' illustrations were finally printed.

Pacific Creek (Sweetwater County, Wyoming)

Pacific Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of Wyoming. The approximately long stream rises on the western side of South Pass and flows into the Little Sandy Creek near Farson, Wyoming. As the name implies, the stream starts just to the west of the Continental Divide and so is on the "Pacific" side of the divide. The waters from the stream eventually flow into the Pacific ocean via the Green River and Colorado River. The stream is a notable landmark on the Oregon, California and Mormon emigration trails.
History.
South Pass was first discovered by European-American traders in 1812; the first wagon trains crossed in 1832. Pacific Creek was the first water that the trains encountered after leaving the Sweetwater River at Burnt Ranch on the eastern side of the pass. Many wagon trains took the opportunity to camp and refresh at Pacific Springs, which is the first significant feeder into Pacific Creek. After leaving Pacific Creek, the wagon trains entered a dry stretch of the trail with the next good water nearly away at the Green River.

2008 San Diego F/A-18 crash

The San Diego F/A-18 crash was the crash of a United States Marine Corps (USMC) F/A-18 Hornet in a residential area of San Diego, California on December 8, 2008. The pilot, First Lieutenant Dan Neubauer (28) from VMFAT-101, was the only crewmember on board the two-seat aircraft; he ejected successfully, landing in a tree. The jet crashed into the University City residential area, destroying two houses and damaging a third. A total of 4 residents in one house, two women and two children, were killed.
A USMC investigation concluded that poor maintenance caused the engine malfunction. Errors by the pilot and USMC personnel on the ground led to the aircraft crashing into the San Diego residential neighborhood. As a result, in early 2009 the pilot was temporarily grounded and thirteen other officers and enlisted personnel were relieved and/or disciplined. The Marine Corps notified other F/A-18 squadrons of the engine and fuel problems discovered during the investigation.
Crash.
On December 8, 2008 Lt Neubauer was piloting an F/A-18D-30-MC Hornet (Lot 12), BuNo "164017", from VMFAT-101, based at MCAS Miramar. Along with several other VMFAT-101 aircraft, he was conducting day and night carrier qualifications (catapult launches and tailhook arrested carrier landings) aboard the aircraft carrier offshore 60 miles southwest of San Diego. Neubauer was the only crewmember on board the two-seat aircraft.
After taking off from the carrier at 11:11 a.m., Neubauer reported an oil caution light for the right engine, and shut it down after efforts to clear the problem failed. After declaring emergency, he was first directed towards Naval Air Station North Island, but was redirected by superior officers to his home base of MCAS Miramar when about away from North Island. Neubauer attempted to make an arrested landing at Miramar but the jet lost power in its second engine while on final approach. Eyewitnesses reported the jet flew slowly eastbound at a low altitude and was dumping fuel (which is not uncommon for an emergency landing). The pilot said that as he broke through the clouds at , his left engine's thrust slipped dangerously low, and he unsuccessfully tried to start the right engine. The left engine lost more thrust, before its generator dropped offline and the jet lost electrical power.
The jet flew over University City High School and crashed into the residential area just past the school about two miles from the Miramar's runway 6L. Neubauer waited "until the last possible moment" to eject from the plane, bailing out at an altitude of just , having attempted to steer away from homes on the ground before the crash. He ejected successfully, landing in a tree in Rose Canyon, just behind a home. The jet crashed into the University City residential area at Cather Ave and Huggins St (between the high school and exit 24 of Interstate 805), destroying two houses and damaging three others. A total of 4 residents in one house, two women and two young children, were killed.
Neubauer was taken to a military hospital and treated for unspecified mild injuries, and reported being "horrified" by the crash at that time. Killed on the ground in one home were Young Mi Lee, 36; her 15-month old baby, Grace; her 2-month-old newborn daughter, Rachel; and her mother, Suk Im Kim, 60, who had recently arrived from South Korea to help care for her daughter’s newborn. The other house destroyed belonged to John and Sunny Wu, who lived there with their two daughters. None of the family was home at the time of the crash, but the home and everything in it were lost.
Aftermath.
In the aftermath of the crash, University City residents renewed previous calls for the US military to relocate aircraft from the base to a more remote location. In a counterpoint, homeowners in University City signed disclosure forms saying they were aware of overflying jets and that this "...extraordinarily rare event...got enormous publicity the risk of living in University City and having a plane fall on you is millions to one." Miramar was also the location of the Navy Fighter Weapons School before it was moved to the more remote Naval Air Station Fallon.
Marine commanders apologized for the crash and defended the decision to order Neubauer to land at Miramar instead of North Island, which isn't surrounded by residences, stating that double-engine failures are extremely rare. Said Colonel Christopher O'Connor, Miramar's commander, "We are not contemplating changing our emergency procedures at this time. We very seldom fly over the area. We take being good neighbors very seriously."
On December 15, 2008, Marine officials stationed in South Korea helped receive Suk Im Kim's remains at Incheon International Airport and transport them to her home in Damyang. The next day, United States Forces Korea commander General Walter L. Sharp sent a delegation to Kim's home headed by Republic of Korea Army Major General Yong-goo Jang and U.S. Marine Corps Major General Frank Panther to express condolences to Kim's son-in-law, Dong-yun Yoon.
As of July 2010, in claims had been paid by the government. Young Mi Lee's husband, Don Yoon, publicly forgave Neubauer during a news conference the day after the crash. Said Sunny Wu of the crash, "I don't want to blame anybody. I think everyone makes mistakes sometimes. Just as long as you can learn from your mistake, it's fine."
In July 2010, Yoon sued Boeing and the United States government for an unspecified amount. In the suit, Yoon alleges that the government violated many of its procedures in its operation of the mishap aircraft and that Boeing was responsible for the defects in the aircraft's fuel systems which caused the crash. Yoon later stated that the compensation offer from the US government for the loss of his four family members and his home was "insulting". Yoon's lawsuit against the US Navy was heard in a federal district court in San Diego in December 2011. On 28 December 2011, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Miller awarded Yoon, his father-in-law, and mother-in-law's three adult children a total of $17.8 million in damage compensation from the U.S. government. The US government appealed the award, and the appellate decision is pending.
The Wu family lived in a temporary home for two years until their home was rebuilt. Their homeowner's insurance did not cover all the cost of the reconstruction, temporary lodging expense, or replacement of all their lost possessions. More surprising, according to the Wu family, is that they have yet to receive any compensation from the US Navy. The family has filed a lawsuit against the US government for compensation for their damages. Said Sunny Zhuang-Wu, "I didn’t know the military would be so difficult." Four other lawsuits against the US Navy for crash damage are pending.
Investigation.
On March 3, 2009, an investigation by the Marine Corps concluded that the accident was preventable. The report was generally scathing in its criticism of the conduct of the participants including: the pilot, the commander of the squadron involved, its top maintenance officer, operations officer, and operations duty officer, all of whom were relieved of duty as a result of the investigation. Nine other Marines have received other disciplinary action.
From the report, it appeared that the jet in question had a known track record of trouble in its left engine for several months. Maintenance was deferred after mechanics detected problems in the fuel flow system, a practice that was allowed at the time under established maintenance rules and procedures (since altered to forbid this practice); the aircraft had flown 146 times since the problem was identified. When the right engine was shut down due to low oil-pressure, the left engine did not receive enough fuel for flight, leading to the crash. Forty similar aircraft throughout the fleet have been grounded to investigate similar fuel issues.
Following the pilot's report of the failure of the jet's right engine, controllers aboard the "Abraham Lincoln", as well as a civilian air traffic controller, directed the pilot to land at NAS North Island – the closest divert field. Squadron officials, however, ordered the pilot to land at MCAS Miramar after a brief discussion, which the investigation deemed "collectively bad decision-making by the duty officer, by the operations officer and by the squadron's commanding officer." The pilot also failed to consult his emergency procedures checklist during the emergency, as well as unnecessarily lengthening his approach to Miramar by making a 270-degree left turn after bypassing North Island, rather than a shorter 90-degree right turn. Specifically, the report criticized Neubauer for not questioning the order to divert to Miramar more forcefully, which he had briefly questioned. The squadron operations officials had underestimated the urgency of the situation, and placed undue emphasis on returning the pilot to his home field, having in mind the pilot's familiarity with that base, the longer runway, and better repair resources.
Despite criticism, Neubauer was returned to a probationary flight status and allowed to resume training in late April 2009, in a decision made by Lieutenant General George J. Trautman, III, the Deputy Commandant for Aviation.

Agroecological restoration

Agroecological restoration is the practice of re-integrating natural systems into agriculture in order to maximize sustainability, ecosystem services, and biodiversity. This is one example of a way to apply the principles of agroecology to an agricultural system.
Overview.
Farms cannot be restored to a purely natural state because of the negative economic impact on farmers, but returning processes, such as pest control to nature with the method of intercropping, allows a farm to be more ecologically sustainable and, at the same time, economically viable. Agroecological restoration works toward this balance of sustainability and economic viability because conventional farming is not sustainable over the long run without the integration of natural systems and because the use of land for agriculture has been a driving force in creating the present world biodiversity crisis. Its efforts are complementary to, rather than a substitute for, biological conservation.
"...biodiversity is just as important on farms and in fields as it is in deep river valleys or mountain cloud forests."
Agriculture creates a conflict over the use of land between wildlife and humans. Though the domestication of crop plants occurred 10,000 years ago, a 500% increase in the amount of pasture and crop land over the last three hundred years has led to the rapid loss of natural habitats. In recent years, the world community acknowledged the value of biodiversity in treaties, such as the 1992 landmark Convention on Biological Diversity.
Reintegration.
The reintegration of agricultural systems into more natural systems will result in decreased yield and produce a more complex system, but there will be considerable gains in biodiversity and ecosystem services.
Biodiversity.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that more than 40% of earth’s land surface is currently used for agriculture. And because so much land has been converted to agriculture, habitat loss is recognized as the driving force in biodiversity loss (FAO). This biodiversity loss often occurred in two steps, as in the American Midwest, with the introduction of mixed farming carried out on small farms and then with the widespread use of mechanized farming and monoculture beginning after World War II. The decline in farmland biodiversity can now be traced to changes in farming practices and increased agricultural intensity.
Increasing heterogeneity.
Heterogeneity (here, the diversity or complexity of the landscape) has been shown to be associated with species diversity. For example, the abundance of butterflies has been found to increase with heterogeneity. One important part of maintaining heterogeneity in the spaces between different fields is made up of habitat that is not cropped, such as grass margins and strips, scrub along field boundaries, woodland, ponds, and fallow land. These seemingly unimportant pieces of land are crucial for the biodiversity of a farm. The presence of field margins benefits many different taxa: the plants attract herbivorous insects, will which attract certain species of birds and those birds will attract their natural predators. Also, the cover provided by the no cropped habitat allows the species that need a large range to move across the landscape.
Monoculture.
In the absence of cover, species face a landscape in which their habitat is greatly fragmented. The isolation of a species to a small habitat that it can’t safely wander from can create a genetic bottleneck, decreasing the resilience of the particular population, and be another factor leading to the decline of the total population of the species. Monoculture, the practice of producing a single crop over a wide area, causes fragmentation. In conventional farming, monoculture, such as with rotations of corn and soybean crops planted in alternating growing seasons, is used so that very high yields can be produced. After the mechanization of farming, monoculture became a standard practice in corn-beans rotation, and had broad implications for the long-term sustainability and biodiversity of farms. Whereas organic fertilizers, had kept the soil’s nutrients fixed to the ecosystem, the introduction of monoculture removed the nutrients and farmers compensated for that loss by using inorganic fertilizers. It is estimated that humans have doubled the rate of nitrogen input into the nitrogen cycle, mostly since 1975. As a result, the biological processes that controlled the way crops used the nutrients changed and the leached nitrogen from farmland soils has become a source of pollution.
Organic farming.
Organic farming is defined in different legal terms by different nations, but its main distinction from conventional farming is that it prohibits the use of synthetic chemicals in crop and livestock production. Often, it also includes diverse crop rotations and provides non-cropped habitat for insects that provide ecosystem services, such as pest control and pollination. However, it is merely encouraged that organic farmers follow those kinds of wildlife friendly practices, and as a result there is a great difference between the ecosystem services that similarly sized but distinctly managed organic farms provide. A recent review of the 76 studies concerning the relationship between biodiversity and organic farming listed three practices associated with organic farming that accounted for the higher biodiversity counts found in organic farms as compared to conventional farms. 
"1. "Prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilizers" is likely to have a positive impact through the removal of both direct and indirect negative effects on arable plants, invertebrates and vertebrates.
2. "Sympathetic management of non-crop habitats and field margins" can enhance diversity and abundance of arable plants, invertebrates, birds and mammals.
3. "Preservation of mixed farming" is likely to positively impact farmland biodiversity through the provision of greater habitat heterogeneity at a variety of temporal and spacial scales within the landscape."

Jet Pink

Jet Pink is the 30th cartoon produced in the "Pink Panther" series. A total of 124 6-minute cartoons were produced between 1964 and 1980. This is the first Pink Panther cartoon directed by Gerry Chiniquy.
Plot.
The Pink Panther walks onto an airfield for an experimental military X-13 jet. Having visions of himself as a famous Air Force pilot, he decides to take the jet for an unauthorized test flight. But the speed of the aircraft is beyond what the panther had anticipated, and because he does not know what the buttons in the cockpit do, the ones that he presses send the airplane into rises, dives, swirls, circles, and low flight over a city. Finally, the Pink Panther activates an ejector seat and is parachuted to the ground, with the parachute opening a second too late. Military Police chase the Pink Panther for him having taken the airplane.

Isla Incahuasi

Isla Incahuasi, Inkawasi or Inka Wasi (Quechua "Inka" Inca, "wasi" house, "Inca house") is a hilly and rocky outcrop of land and former island in Bolivia situated in the middle of Salar de Uyuni, the world's largest salt flat, at an elevation of 3,656 meters (11,995 ft). It is located in the Potosí Department, Daniel Campos Province, Tahua Municipality, Yonza Canton. "Isla Incahuasi" is the Spanish name where "isla" means island, "Inca" stands for Inca, and "huasi" is derived from the Quechua word "wasi" meaning house.
Incahuasi has a total area of and hosts gigantic cacti ("Trichocereus pasacana") and a tourist center. There are unusual and fragile coral-like structures and deposits that often consist of fossils and algae. The place is the top of the remains of an ancient volcano, which was submerged when the area was part of a giant prehistoric lake, roughly 40,000 years ago.

Tomb of Liliana Crociati de Szaszak

The tomb of Liliana Crociati de Szaszak is a tomb in La Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires, Argentina, known for its unusual design.
26-year-old Liliana Crociati de Szaszak (1944–1970) was in Innsbruck, Austria on 26 February 1970, when her hotel was struck by an avalanche, killing her. Her tomb was designed by her mother in the Neo-Gothic style, in sharp contrast to the other tombs in the cemetery. Adjacent to the tomb stands a dais adorned with a plaque containing an Italian-language poem by her father, and topped by a life-size green bronze statue of Crociati de Szaszak in her wedding dress, by sculptor Wíeredovol Viladrich. Following the death of Crociati's dog Sabú, a bronze statue of the dog, also by Viladrich, was added, with Crociati's hand resting on the dog's head.

Saint Mary's School (Raleigh, North Carolina)

Saint Mary's School is an independent, Episcopal, college-preparatory, boarding and day school dedicated to academic excellence and personal achievement for girls in grades 9-12. Located in Raleigh, North Carolina, Saint Mary's School is operated as an independent school, and has an historic association with the Episcopal Church and has an Episcopal chapel, St. Mary's Chapel, on the school's grounds. The school formerly operated as Saint Mary's College and educated young women in grades 11-12 and their freshman and sophomore years in college. The school changed to a four year high school in 1998, at which point the name reverted to Saint Mary's School, the original name of the institution when it was founded in 1842.
School information.
The school has 40 faculty members, with 83% holding advanced degrees. Enrollment for the 2013-2014 school year is 265 full-time students, representing 12 states and five countries. The average class size is 13 students. 
Among the superlatives assigned to the school include the oldest continuously operated school in Raleigh, North Carolina, the third oldest girl's school in the state, and the fourth oldest girls boarding/day school in the United States.
History.
Founded in 1842 by the Rev. Aldert Smedes, an Episcopal priest, Saint Mary’s School has operated continuously on the same site ever since. 
With the support of the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina, Smedes founded Saint Mary’s as a school for young ladies "designed to furnish a thorough and excellent education equal to the best that can be obtained in the city of New York, or in any Northern school." The school was founded on the site of the Episcopal School of North Carolina, a short-lived school for boys in the 1830s. Three of the present school buildings - East Rock, West Rock and Smedes Hall - formed the original campus. East Rock and West Rock, the first two buildings, were constructed with remnant stones from the construction of the North Carolina state capitol. 
History tells us that 13 girls, "The Original 13," arrived on the first day, May 12, 1842. A total of 21 students enrolled for the first session. 
During the Civil War, Saint Mary’s became a safe haven for relatives of both Union and Confederate generals, including Robert E. Lee’s daughter and the family of Jefferson Davis. Smedes kept the school operating throughout the war. In 1865, General Tecumseh Sherman’s Union troops camped in The Grove on front campus, and Sherman visited Smedes in the main building. 
Today, Saint Mary's School is an independent, Episcopal, college-preparatory, boarding and day school dedicated to academic excellence and personal achievement for girls in grades 9-12. Saint Mary's School remains true to Aldert Smedes' time-honored mission of providing an excellent education for young women. 
The historic core of the school's 23-acre campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a stop on the North Carolina Civil War Trails. The Saint Mary’s Chapel, designed by Richard Upjohn, is a National Historic Site, and five of the school’s 25 buildings are Raleigh Historic Properties.
For a more detailed history of Saint Mary’s School, pick up a copy of “The Heritage” written by Saint Mary’s professor emerita, Martha Sprouse Stoops. 
Campus.
Saint Mary's buildings date from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and also include antebellum structures individually recognized as Local Historic Landmarks. Three buildings from the 1830s are visible from Hillsborough Street from behind a wooded glade of large oaks, hollies, and magnolias.
The school's oldest structures, East and West Rock, are matching buildings of discarded stone from the building of the second State Capitol in the 1830s. The brick Greek Revival building between them was erected soon after; it was remodeled in 1909 to include a Neoclassical Revival front portico and dormitory wings. This main building was named Smedes Hall for the school's founder, the Rev. Aldert Smedes.
Two buildings erected in the later nineteenth century are Gothic in style: the 1855 Richard Upjohn Gothic Chapel and the 1887 Gothic Revival arts building, a brick structure with pointed-arch windows.
The early twentieth century saw much construction; nearly all the permanent brick buildings, which were rendered in the Colonial Revival style, survive. Later construction continued to complement earlier buildings, and the view of the campus from Hillsborough Street remains notable for its historic integrity.
Saint Mary’s School was listed on the National Register in 1978. Currently, the campus is considered to be part of downtown Raleigh.

<doc id="20600059" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20600059" title="Deggendorf–Kalteneck railway">
Deggendorf–Kalteneck railway

The Deggendorf–Kalteneck railway linked the railway line running through the Bavarian Forest from Plattling via Zwiesel to Bayerisch Eisenstein with the Ilz Valley railway ("Ilztalbahn") from Passau via Waldkirchen to Freyung. In keeping with the naming of the Bavarian Forest railway or "Waldbahn" from Plattling to Bayerisch Eisenstein, it was called the "Vorwaldbahn" (lit: pre-Forest railway).
Construction.
Following the construction of the Bavarian Forest railway from Plattling via Deggendorf to Bayerisch Eisenstein, completed in 1877, and the Ilz Valley railway from Passau to Freyung, finished in 1892, the local communities situated between these routes, including Aicha, Eging and Tittling, also strove to have a railway. They favoured a stub line from Vilshofen to the north. But there was a realisation that against that, one the one hand, the land rose steeply from the Danube valley and, on the other, it would need a bridge across the Danube. After wrestling with the problem for a long time the Royal Bavarian State Railways decided to build a cross-country route between the two existing railways as the most cost-effective solution.
So the Bavarian state parliament, the Landtag, decided to build a single-tracked cross-country line from Deggendorf via Eging to Kalteneck with a junction to the Ilz Valley railway, passing the requisite law on 26 June 1908. This route could also link up the harbour at Deggendorf and the market at Hengersberg to the railway network. The liability for contentious land acquisition was taken on by Deggendorf, Hengersberg and Passau on behalf of the state railway.
Construction began in summer 1910 at both ends of the line. As a result the 11.62 km long section from Deggendorf to Hengersberg and the 20.75 km long stretch from Kalteneck to Eging were opened as early as 26 November 1913 with great celebrations. The centre section, 21.66 km long, went into service on 1 August 1914 on the eve of the First World War without much ado.
Rail traffic.
For the train services, the Bavarian "Lokalbahn" engines at the locomotive depots ("Bahnbetriebswerke") of Plattling and Passau were made available. On the Deggendorf-Hengersberg line three pairs of trains ran daily for the first few months and, between Eging and Kalteneck, four pairs. The four pairs of through trains initially deployed once the line was fully opened were gradually reduced during the First World War to two pairs. Because these trains also had to take goods wagons with them the journey times on the line were long. In 1936 five pairs of trains worked the route, with trains from both directions ending in Eging in the evening and returning in the morning. In 1976 the five train pairs only ran on weekdays. On Sundays they were replaced by three bus services.
Closures.
With the increase in private transport the number of passengers on this line steadily waned, although additional stops were added and operations were switched to railbuses. The freight and part-load goods traffic also suffered heavy losses. As a result the line was closed little by little. First to go were the passenger services that were withdrawn between Eging and Kalteneck on 1 October 1972. On 3 June 1973 goods traffic from Tittling to Kalteneck ceased too. Of note is that this section was used for occasional diversions to or from Freyung and remained operational for over 20 years. The next closure again affected passenger services, this time from Deggendorf to Eging on 25 September 1981. It was followed by the cessation of goods traffic from Eging to Tittling and, with that, the closure of the entire Eging–Kalteneck section on 2 April 1995. On 2 September 2002 the same fate met the Hengersberg–Eging part of the line. After the removal of the tracks the trackbed was turned into a cycle path, which was fully opened in 2006. On the 11.6 km long remaining section from Deggendorf Hbf via Deggendorf Hafen to Hengersberg only goods traffic now plies. The Deggendorf Hafen (exclusively)–Hengersberg section was transferred on 1 September 2007 as a private industrial line to the ownership of the "DHB Grundstücks GmbH + Co. KG". This section is used for goods traffic serving the Schwaiger sawmill.

Plot.
The Pink Panther joins a construction crew at a building site, where his inexperience causes a series of disasters. By slamming a door, he repeatedly ruins a worker's wall-plaster work as the plaster liquefies due to the noise of the slamming door and spills off the wall. Looking for a place to dispose of trash, the panther removes hot rivets from a bucket and pours them into a workman's hard hat; when the man puts the hat on, he experiences scorching pain. The final blow emerges when the Pink Panther tries to move a steel girder, which hits a wooden beam being carried by one of the workers and triggers a chain-reaction of collisions that destroys the foundations of the building. The Pink Panther flees the enraged construction workers, who give chase.
Laugh track.
"The Pink Panther Show" contained a laugh track when the Pink Panther cartoons were broadcast on NBC. Currently, the France Channel Gulli and the Spanish language Boomerang TV channel air the version containing the laugh track.

L'Extase matérielle is an essay written by French Nobel laureate J. M. G. Le Clézio. The book's title means Material Ecstasy in English. This essay may be advising that we should pay the utmost attention to what there is around us, not to what there might be or ought to be. According to a review of L'Extase matérielle the reasoning behind the essay is to accept that "what there is is all there is"(and to demand more is ludicrous)
Writing style.
This essay consists of personal deliberations, discursively written, which are (probably) intended more to provoke his readers than to comfort them. Le Clézio seems to have been motivated to write this essay not just taking ideas from other writers, but also to explain his own research and also to relate his very own perspective on life. The essay is emotionally written.
Principles.
This is a collection of essays which explicitly theorize many of the principles Le Clézio himself wrote in Terra Amata. Le Clezio expresses his fondness for small things in these essays.

Oregon gubernatorial election, 2010

The Oregon gubernatorial election of 2010 was held on Tuesday, to elect the Governor of Oregon, who will serve a four-year term to begin on . The incumbent governor, Democrat Ted Kulongoski, was ineligible to run due to term limits barring him from being elected to more than two consecutive terms.
The Democratic candidate John Kitzhaber, who had previously served two terms as governor from 1995 to 2003, was elected to a third term, earning a narrow victory over Republican candidate Chris Dudley and two minor party candidates. Kitzhaber's election marked the first time in Oregon's history that a person has been elected to a third term as governor.
Almost every opinion poll throughout the election season showed a statistical tie between the two. State Republicans saw this election as the best chance to win the governorship since the last Republican governor, Victor Atiyeh, was re-elected in 1982. Once polls closed on election day, Dudley had led in early vote counts, but Kitzhaber's wide margins in Multnomah and Lane counties eventually erased Dudley's lead.
Oregon first used its new cross nomination system, a form of fusion voting, in the 2010 general elections. In this system, a candidate for partisan public office can be nominated by up to three political parties.
Kitzhaber was nominated by the Independent Party of Oregon in addition to the Democratic Party.

Oregon first used its new cross nomination system, a form of fusion voting, in the 2010 general elections. In this system, a candidate for partisan public office can be nominated by up to three political parties.
As a result, the Independent Party of Oregon did not file a candidate and instead chose to hold a month-long online primary in July. In doing so, it became the first political party in the United States to conduct a binding statewide primary election entirely over the Internet,
and it was the largest nominating process ever held by an Oregon minor political party.
Republican Chris Dudley did not apply for the Independent Party nomination by the required date, so he was not on the ballot, but he could be written in.
General election.
Campaign.
Following the primaries, the two leading candidates, Dudley and Kitzhaber, campaigned separately throughout the state for the summer. Despite attempts by both campaigns to arrange a debate, the candidates could only agree on a single debate on September 30. Through the end of September, the Dudley campaign had raised $5.6 million, more than twice as much as the Kitzhaber campaign.
Throughout the last few months of the campaign, opinion polls showed a tight race with the lead apparently changing frequently. Due to the closeness of the race, President Barack Obama, for whom Oregon voted by a 16-percent margin in 2008, stumped for Kitzhaber; then headlined a rally at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland on .

<doc id="20600093" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20600093" title="Sandwich theory">
Sandwich theory

Sandwich theory describes the behaviour of a beam, plate, or shell which consists of three layers - two facesheets and one core. The most commonly used sandwich theory is linear and is an extension of first order beam theory. Linear sandwich theory is of importance for the design and analysis of sandwich panels, which are of use in building construction, vehicle construction, airplane construction and refrigeration engineering. 
Some advantages of sandwich construction are:
The behavior of a beam with sandwich cross-section under a load differs from a beam with a constant elastic cross section as can be observed in the adjacent figure. If the radius of curvature during bending is large compared to the thickness of the sandwich beam and the strains in the component materials are small, the deformation of a sandwich composite beam can be separated into two parts
Sandwich beam, plate, and shell theories usually assume that the reference stress state is one of zero stress. However, during curing, differences of temperature between the face-sheets persist because of the thermal separation by the core material. These temperature differences, coupled with different linear expansions of the face-sheets, can lead to a bending of the sandwich beam in the direction of the warmer face-sheet. If the bending is constrained during the manufacturing process, residual stresses can develop in the components of a sandwich composite. The superposition of a reference stress state on the solutions provided by sandwich theory is possible when the problem is linear. However, when large elastic deformations and rotations are expected, the initial stress state has to be incorporated directly into the sandwich theory.
Engineering sandwich beam theory.
In the engineering theory of sandwich beams, the axial strain is assumed to vary linearly over the cross-section of the beam as in Euler-Bernoulli theory, i.e.,
Therefore the axial stress in the sandwich beam is given by
where formula_3 is the Young's modulus which is a function of the location along the thickness of the beam. The bending moment in the beam is then given by
The quantity formula_5 is called the flexural stiffness of the sandwich beam. The shear force formula_6 is defined as
Using these relations, we can show that the stresses in a sandwich beam with a core of thickness formula_8 and modulus formula_9 and two facesheets each of thickness formula_10 and modulus formula_11, are given by
For a sandwich beam with identical facesheets and unit width, the value of formula_5 is 
If formula_15, then formula_5 can be approximated as
and the stresses in the sandwich beam can be approximated as
If, in addition, formula_19, then
and the approximate stresses in the beam are
If we assume that the facesheets are thin enough that the stresses may be assumed to be constant through the thickness, we have the approximation
Hence the problem can be split into two parts, one involving only core shear and the other involving only bending stresses in the facesheets.
Linear sandwich theory.
Bending of a sandwich beam with thin facesheets.
The main assumptions of linear sandwich theories of beams with thin facesheets are:
However, the xz shear-stresses in the core are not neglected.
Constitutive assumptions.
The constitutive relations for two-dimensional orthotropic linear elastic materials are
The assumptions of sandwich theory lead to the simplified relations
and
The equilibrium equations in two dimensions are
The assumptions for a sandwich beam and the equilibrium equation imply that
Therefore, for homogeneous facesheets and core, the strains also have the form
Kinematics.
Let the sandwich beam be subjected to a bending moment formula_29 and a shear force formula_30. Let the total deflection of the beam due to these loads be formula_31. The adjacent figure shows that, for small displacements, the total deflection of the mid-surface of the beam can be expressed as the sum of two deflections, a pure bending deflection formula_32 and a pure shear deflection formula_33, i.e.,
From the geometry of the deformation we observe that the engineering shear strain (formula_35) in the core is related the effective shear strain in the composite by the relation
Note the shear strain in the core is larger than the effective shear strain in the composite and that small deformations (formula_37) are assumed in deriving the above relation. The effective shear strain in the beam is related to the shear displacement by the relation
The facesheets are assumed to deform in accordance with the assumptions of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The total deflection of the facesheets is assumed to be the superposition of the deflections due to bending and that due to core shear. The formula_39-direction displacements of the facesheets due to bending are given by
The displacement of the top facesheet due to shear in the core is
and that of the bottom facesheet is
The normal strains in the two facesheets are given by
Therefore
Stress-displacement relations.
The shear stress in the core is given by
or,
The normal stresses in the facesheets are given by
Hence,
Resultant forces and moments.
The resultant normal force in a facesheet is defined as
and the resultant moments are defined as
where
Using the expressions for the normal stress in the two facesheets gives
In the core, the resultant moment is
The total bending moment in the beam is
or,
The shear force formula_6 in the core is defined as
where formula_58 is a shear correction coefficient. The shear force in the facesheets can be computed from the bending moments using the relation
or,
For thin facesheets, the shear force in the facesheets is usually ignored.
Bending and shear stiffness.
The bending stiffness of the sandwich beam is given by
From the expression for the total bending moment in the beam, we have
For small shear deformations, the above expression can be written as
Therefore, the bending stiffness of the sandwich beam (with formula_19) is given by
and that of the facesheets is
The shear stiffness of the beam is given by
Therefore the shear stiffness of the beam, which is equal to the shear stiffness of the core, is
Relation between bending and shear deflections.
A relation can be obtained between the bending and shear deflections by using the continuity of tractions between the core and the facesheets. If we equate the tractions directly we get
At both the facesheet-core interfaces formula_70 but at the top of the core formula_71 and at the bottom of the core formula_72. Therefore, traction continuity at formula_73 leads to
The above relation is rarely used because of the presence of second derivatives of the shear deflection. Instead it is assumed that 
which implies that
Governing equations.
Using the above definitions, the governing balance equations for the bending moment and shear force are
We can alternatively express the above as two equations that can be solved for formula_31 and formula_33 as
Using the approximations
where formula_82 is the intensity of the applied load on the beam, we have
Several techniques may be used to solve this system of two coupled ordinary differential equations given the applied load and the applied bending moment and displacement boundary conditions.
Temperature dependent alternative form of governing equations.
Assuming that each partial cross section fulfills Bernoulli's hypothesis, the balance of forces and moments on the deformed sandwich beam element can be used to deduce the bending equation for the sandwich beam.
The stress resultants and the corresponding deformations of the beam and of the cross section can be seen in Figure 1. The following relationships can be derived using the theory of linear elasticity:
where
Superposition of the equations for the facesheets and the core leads to the following equations for the total shear force formula_30 and the total bending moment formula_29:
We can alternatively express the above as two equations that can be solved for formula_31 and formula_35, i.e.,
Solution approaches.
The bending behavior and stresses in a continuous sandwich beam can be computed by solving the two governing differential equations.
Analytical approach.
For simple geometries such as double span beams under uniformly distributed loads, the governing equations can be solved by using appropriate boundary conditions and using the superposition principle. Such results are listed in the standard DIN EN 14509:2006(Table E10.1). Energy methods may also be used to compute solutions directly.
Numerical approach.
The differential equation of sandwich continuous beams can be solved by the use of numerical methods such as finite differences and finite elements. For finite differences Berner recommends a two-stage approach. After solving the differential equation for the normal forces in the cover sheets for a single span beam under a given load, the energy method can be used to expand the approach for the calculation of multi-span beams. Sandwich continuous beam with flexible cover sheets can also be laid on top of each other when using this technique. However, the cross-section of the beam has to be constant across the spans.
A more specialized approach recommended by Schwarze involves solving for the homogeneous part of the governing equation exactly and for the particular part approximately. Recall that the governing equation for a sandwich beam is
If we define
we get
Schwarze uses the general solution for the homogeneous part of the above equation and a polynomial approximation for the particular solution for sections of a sandwich beam. Interfaces between sections are tied together by matching boundary conditions. This approach has been used in the open source code swe2.
Practical Importance.
Results predicted by linear sandwich theory correlate well with the experimentally determined results. The theory is used as a basis for the structural report which is needed for the construction of large industrial and commercial buildings which are clad with sandwich panels . Its use is explicitly demanded for approvals and in the relevant engineering standards.

Plot.
The Pink Panther decides to construct and fly a kite, and a dog promptly jumps right through it. The panther rebuilds his kite and attempts to fly it, and begins to make life a living hell for a nearby homeowner (the Little Man). Capping an increasingly destructive series of accidents, the panther's kite tracks through the Little Man's barbecue and catches fire. It lands on the man's house and the house goes up in flames. Within seconds, the house is reduced to smoldering rubble. The Little Man goes ballistic and declares war on the Pink Panther by flying a biplane Red Baron-style in a vengeful attempt to shoot down the Pink Panther, who is soaring through the air in his new, wing-sized kite.

Mercy Thompson

Mercedes Athena "Mercy" Thompson is a fictional character and the protagonist of The Mercedes Thompson Series, written by Patricia Briggs. The series, which currently consists of the novels "Moon Called", "Blood Bound", "Iron Kissed", "Bone Crossed", "Silver Borne", "River Marked", and "Frost Burned" is narrated from Mercy's point of view.
History.
In the novels, Mercy Thompson is the daughter of a Blackfeet Indian and a white teenage mother. She is a "Walker" (a Native American shapeshifter not linked to the moon) who turns into a coyote, a gift she inherited from her father. A rodeo man, he died a few days after consummating his relationship with her mother.
One day, not too long after Mercy was born, her mother went to her crib only to find a small coyote pup in her place. Afraid and unsure how to raise her, her mother took her to the only place she knew was capable—friends of an uncle, who had been a werewolf. This is how she came to be raised with the pack of Bran, the Marrok of the werewolves.
Appearances.
Moon Called.
"Moon Called" is the beginning of the story of Mercedes Thompson. Mercy's life is not exactly normal. Her next-door neighbor is a werewolf, her former boss is a gremlin, and she's fixing a Volkswagen bus for a vampire. But then, Mercy isn't exactly normal herself.
She's a walker, not only capable of shifting into coyote shape at will but also possessed of a sharp nose for scenting other creatures and an ability to sense magic when it is at work. So when a teenage werewolf approaches Mercy asking for work, she knows what he is immediately. She also knows it would be more prudent to refuse him, but he looks so desperate that she hires him anyway.
Turns out the werewolf, who goes by Mac, has escaped from a laboratory where he was being experimented on. When bad guys show up looking for him and Mercy kills one of them, also a werewolf, she realizes it's time to turn the matter over to the local Alpha werewolf, who also happens to be her next-door divorced neighbor Adam.
Before you can say “from the frying pan into the fire,” things go awry and Mercy finds and just barely saves a wounded Adam, whose fifteen-year-old daughter Jesse has been kidnapped by the same people who came after Mac. To help Adam heal, Mercy must take him to Montana, and the pack of werewolves who raised her. There we meet Bran, leader of all the North American werewolves, whose son Samuel is the man whom Mercy once loved and lost.
Eventually, Adam, Samuel and Mercy return to the Tri-Cities to search for Adam's missing daughter. In the process they have encounters with fae, vampires, other werewolves, and a witch or two. Mercy must contend not only with all these creatures but with Adam and Samuel's interest in her and the territorial contentiousness that results from it.
Blood Bound.
In "Blood Bound" we learn that Mercy is somewhat resistant to some magics such as vampire compulsion or werewolf pack control. Because of her magic resistance, vampire friend Stefan calls upon her to deliver a message to a visiting vampire who has failed to pay the proper respects to Stefan’s seethe. Stefan is fearful that the visiting vampire has some type of magic that can compel him to do things he wouldn’t ordinarily do and that Mercy is hopefully immune and will be able to report back to his seethe should anything happen to him.
Of course, things go badly and soon Mercy is wrapped up in a hunt for a vampire/sorcerer who is causing the Tri Cities area to have an increased rise in violence, harming werewolf friends, and endangering lives of innocents. To complicate things, her feelings for Adam, the local Alpha, are scaring her and her feelings for Samuel, an old flame, appear unresolved. Throw in a bit of vampire, fae, and werewolf politics.
Iron Kissed.
In "Iron Kissed" we find Mercy at a crossroads in her relationships with the two men in her life, Samuel and Adam Hauptman. Both are extremely dominant werewolves, although Samuel is a lone wolf and Adam is the alpha of the Tri Cities werewolf pack. Mercy must decide which one she loves more because Adam has declared his feelings for her and her lack of definitive response is weakening the pack.
When her mechanic mentor, Siebold Adelbertsmiter a.k.a. Zee, calls upon her to repay a favor to the Fae, she is grateful for the distraction. There have been several unsolved murders on the Fae reservation and the magic on which the fae can call without incurring the wrath of the Grey Lords has been insufficient in finding the perpetrator. Mercy is called in to use her nose to see if she can find an identifying scent of the murderer.
She finds their murderer, and identifies him to Zee. Shortly thereafter she learns that Zee was caught by police at the house of the Fae's killer, with the body of the murderer, and as such is charged with murder. The Fae want a quick cover-up so as not to arouse anti-fae sentiments, and Zee wants Mercy out of it so that she will not anger the Grey Lords and get herself in more trouble. Regardless, Mercy throws herself into finding the real killer and exonerating Zee.
Mercy eventually figures out who did the killing but not before something tragic befalls her. In order for her to move on, she must come to terms emotionally and physically with this tragedy.
Bone Crossed.
Bone crossed begins with the arrival of Stefan, Mercy's vampire friend, on the floor of her living room, flayed, starved, and barely recognizable. He warns her that Marsilia, the Mistress of his seethe, is aware of her involvement in the death of one of her get, Andre, and tells her to run. The Mistress has had a pair of crossed bones placed on Mercy's door, magicked so they can't be removed, as a sign to other vampires and minions that she is a traitor. While Stefan is recovering, he accidentally floods Mercy's mind with his, reliving the deaths of his menagerie, and Adam brings her into the pack to snap her out of it. The vampires place a magical trap in Uncle Mike's, the fae tavern, that kills one of the pack, though she is revived. The wolves need to negotiate peace with Marsilia, and Mercy needs to get out of town.
Amber, a friend of mercy's from college shows up to ask Mercy if she will come to their house to investigate her son's claims that there is a ghost in the house. Mercy discusses it with Adam, Samuel, and Bran, who tell her that there is only one powerful supernatural creature in Amber's home city of Spokane, the vampire Jim Blackwood, called The Monster. They believe that he will not notice her, so she will be safe there. Unfortunately, he is one of Amber's husband's biggest clients, and he has an invite to the house, including dinner the first day she's there. In the two nights she is at the house, he bites her and exchanges blood with her twice, claiming her as one of his "sheep," of which she learns Amber is another. The second night she wakes in the middle of the night to find Stefan there, and Amber's son Chad in a room full of frost, frozen to his bedclothes, and not breathing. They save Chad and advise the family to run, heading back to the Tri-Cities. Stephan exchanges blood with Mercy to claim her from Blackwood.
When they get back, two rebellious vampires from the seethe (not made by the Mistress and not easily disposed of because of who their maker is) come to Stefan separately to ask him to help them remove Marsilia. He refuses, keeping his word to the Mistress. Shortly after they both have made their requests, Marsilia summons the wolves and Mercy to a 'meeting' to discuss peace. At the meeting she questions Bernard and Estelle, the rebellious vampires, with an old chair that detects whether the person sitting in it is being truthful. Then she questions Mercy and Stephan, her questions proving that he is no longer hers: this makes his testimony that of a third party, and she uses it to have Estelle killed and Bernard returned to his maker.
Soon after Mercy returns home, Amber's husband Corban appears and stuns Mercy with a taser, and brings her to Blackwood because The Monster has Chad. He has killed Amber, but keeps her animated corpse around to do chores. Mercy, Chad, Corban, and a tree fae called Oakman are kept in cages under the house. Blackwood can absorb the power of whatever person/creature he feeds on. The Oakman allows him to be active in daylight, and Mercy's walker blood will allow him to command ghosts. Stefan finds her, and she convinces him to save Chad, on the condition that should she survive, he will be forgiven for the deaths of the two people he had killed in "Blood Bound". The fae walking stick shows up and Mercy gives it to the Oakman on his request. She escapes her cage, and while she is fighting Blackwood, the fae throws it at the vampire's back, staking him. Stefan and Mercy return to the Tri-Cities, where Stefan learns that Marsilia did not kill his people, but merely cut his ties to them so that he would think them dead. He agrees to return to the seethe.
Silver Borne.
When mechanic and shapeshifter Mercy Thompson attempts to return a powerful Fae book she'd previously borrowed in an act of desperation, she finds the bookstore locked up and closed down. It seems the book contains secret knowledge-and the Fae will do just about anything to keep it out of the wrong hands. And if that doesn't take enough of Mercy's attention, her friend Samuel is struggling with his wolf side-leaving Mercy to cover for him, lest his own father declare Sam's life forfeit. All in all, Mercy has had better days. And if she isn't careful, she might not have many more to live...
River Marked.
Car mechanic Mercy Thompson has always known there was something different about her, and not just the way she can make a VW engine sit up and beg. Mercy is a shapeshifter, a talent she inherited from her long-gone father. She's never known any others of her kind. Until now.
An evil is stirring in the depths of the Columbia River-one that her father's people may know something about. And to have any hope of surviving, Mercy and her mate, the Alpha werewolf Adam, will need their help...
Characterization.
Physical appearance.
Mercy is described in the novels as being of average height, around 5'6", and average weight with long, straight, dark brunette hair (often kept in braids). She has a muscular build from karate lessons, and tanned skin. Identifying marks include a tattoo of a coyote paw print on her belly, below her navel, and buckshot scars on her behind. In coyote form, she weighs 32 lbs. When her adoptive parents died she was fourteen, it happened 17 years ago that makes her 31 years old.
Personality traits, abilities, and interests.
Mercy is described as being stubborn, headstrong, independent, hardworking, thoughtful, and caring. She can change between human and coyote form easily. In coyote form, she is capable of running at fast speeds and has increased sight in the dark. In both human and coyote form, she has an increased sense of smell and a resistance to some forms of magic. It has been shown that she has the ability to see (and control) ghosts. It is explained that this is the reason Walkers are so rare. Vampires have hunted them down to prevent them from being "Vampire Hunters" Because where ever vampires live there are usually ghosts of victims to reveal them.
She works as an auto mechanic and is a deliberate bad neighbor, keeping increasingly decrepit and dismantled cars on her lawn to irritate Adam.
Character History.
Mercy grew up in Bran's (i e. the Marrok) pack because her mother couldn't cope with Mercy turning into a coyote. Her mum conceived her on a one night stand with a Blackfeet Indian and gave birth to Mercy when she was 17 years old. Mercy's father was a rodeo man called Joe Old Coyote; he died before Mercy was born. At a young age, Mercy almost ran away with Sam/Samuel because she thought they were in love. Bran warned her that he mostly only wanted her as a "Brood Mare" because she could bear him children, unlike female werewolves who cannot carry a child to term. At that point she left the Marrok's pack and returned to live with her mother until graduating from college and later finding work as a mechanic.

RAF Woolfox Lodge

Royal Air Force Station Woolfox Lodge is a former RAF aerodrome next to the A1 road in Rutland, UK. The airfield is split between the parishes of Empingham and Greetham. It was open from 1940 until 1965. 
History.
Woolfox opened as a reserve landing ground for RAF Cottesmore then became a satellite to RAF North Luffenham in October 1941. Full station status granted from June 1943. The wartime airfield comprised three tarmac runways and one Type B1 and four T2 aircraft hangars. There was temporary accommodation for 1149 male and 252 female personnel.
RAF Woolfox Lodge was used in later years as a relief landing ground but the runways deteriorated to such a degree that the airfield had to be closed to flying by spring 1954. In 1960 a Bloodhound surface-to-air missile site under No. 62 Squadron was positioned in a secure area adjacent to the A1 road near the former technical site. 
Current use.
The site is now used for agriculture and employment purposes.

Moritz von Hirschfeld

Karl Ulrich Friedrich Wilhelm Moritz von Hirschfeld (July 4, 1791 in Halberstadt - October 13, 1859 in Coblenz), Prussian soldier, got his schooling in a military academy. In 1806, he entered into his father's regiment and participated in the unhappy campaign of that year. In 1809, he participated with his older brother Eugen in an uprising against the French occupation forces. This ended in their fleeing to England in 1810. Both joined the Spanish dragoons in their struggles against the French. His brother was killed in battle in 1811. Lieutenant Moritz received severe wounds two times in battle, and ended in French captivity. He escaped in 1813, under very dangerous circumstances. His 15 wounds made him barely recognizable when he received a medal for his actions.
Hirschfeld returned to the Prussian army in 1815, and in the succeeding peaceful years climbed the ranks in the military. 1849 found him commander of the 15th division of the Prussian army under the command of the Prince of Prussia. He participated in the battles which drove the rebel army out of the Palatinate and into the arms of the forces under Mieroslawski. After relieving the Landau fortress, which was in the hands of the officers who had not gone over, he led two divisions against Mieroslawski. At Waghäusel, he obligated that numerically far greater force to retreat. Then he participated in the battle at the Murg which obligated the rebel army to disperse and resulted in the collapse of the uprising.

Sark general election, 2008

The Sark general election, 2008, held on 10 December 2008, was the first election held in the Channel Island of Sark under a new constitutional arrangement.
Fifty-seven candidates (almost 10% of the population) stood for 28 seats in the Chief Pleas. The elected members in the new Chief Pleas are titled Conseillers and have replaced the mixed system of elected People's Deputies and ex-officio Tenants in the outgoing Chief Pleas. Presidency of the Chief Pleas has been retained by the Seneschal, whose term has been extended from three years to for-life. The Conseillers elected in 2008 will serve for either four years or two years. Those 14 Conseillers elected for two-year mandates served until the next election in December 2010 where the successive mandate was for four years, thus achieving a rolling election cycle. The selection of which Conseillers elected in 2008 served a two-year mandate or four-year mandate was determined by random ballot.
A recount was called to take place on 11 December due to the closeness of the votes for the 28th seat.
Background.
On 16 January and 21 February 2008, the Chief Pleas approved a law which introduces a 30-member chamber, with 28 elected members and two unelected members. On 9 April 2008 the Privy Council approved the Sark law reforms, and the new chamber convened for the first time on 21 January 2009.
Election.
The first election held in Sark under the new system took place on 10 December 2008. In total, 28 "Conseillers" were to be elected from 57 candidates, with the latter figure representing about 12% of the electorate in the island. Each voter received 28 votes to select their preferred candidates for each of the available seats. A recount was ordered as several of the candidates for the last seat were separated by only a few votes.
The election reflected the "Sark chasm" throughout the island between those who support the traditional system and those who support further reforms.
Results.
The overwhelming majority of candidates who were elected had either previously voted in Chief Pleas to enact the 2008 Reform Law, or had made public statements in support of it, and have since advocated the further dismantling of the feudal system via the reform of the ancient feudal land tenure laws.
Results from the second count were:
After the results of the ballot were declared, a separate ballot was held among the 28 successful Conseillers to determine which would serve for two years, and which for four years, which is indicated by the figure after the number of votes. After the initial period, Conseillers will serve four-year terms with half elected every two years.
Reaction of Barclay brothers.
When it became apparent that only about five candidates they had supported had been elected, the Barclay brothers announced that they were shutting down their businesses on Sark — hotels, shops, estate agents and building firms — leaving about 100 people, or a sixth of the population, out of work. The closures started almost immediately following the announcement. Diana Beaumont, the wife of Seigneur John Michael Beaumont, commented that "Barclay brothers were the ones that started all this democracy business, now they don’t like it because they haven't won." The States of Jersey, sitting in session on 12 December 2008, resolved to send a message of support to its sister island of Sark.
In January 2009, the Barclays quietly began reversing the shutdown process.

1927–28 New York Rangers season

The 1927–28 New York Rangers season was the second season for the team in the National Hockey League. In the regular season, the Rangers finished in second place in the American Division with a 19–16–9 record and qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs. In a pair of two-game total goals series, New York defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates and Boston Bruins to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they faced the Montreal Maroons. The Rangers defeated the Maroons 3–2 to win their first Stanley Cup.
Playoffs.
The circus knocked the Rangers out of Madison Square Garden, and all games for the Stanley Cup Finals were played in the Montreal Forum. The Maroons won game one 2–0, as Red Dutton and Bill "Bat" Phillips scored goals, and goaltender Clint Benedict made 19 saves.
A well-known incident occurred in game two when Nels Stewart fired a hard shot that struck New York goaltender Lorne Chabot in the eye. He could not continue, and the Rangers needed a goaltender. However, when the Maroons refused to let the Rangers use Alex Connell or minor league goaltender Hugh McCormick, Rangers coach Lester Patrick decided to don the pads himself. The Rangers then increased their defensive pressure when any Maroon attempted a shot on Patrick. Bill Cook scored, putting the Rangers ahead 1–0, but Nels Stewart was not to be denied and scored, tying the game. In overtime, Frank Boucher got the winner for the Rangers 7:05 into overtime. The 44-year-old Patrick made 17 saves in his goaltending stint.
Joe "Red Light" Miller, New York Americans goalie, was allowed to take Chabot's place in goal, and he played well in a 2–0 loss in game three. However, Frank Boucher starred as the Rangers took the next two games, and the Stanley Cup; he scored twice in the Rangers' 2–1 game five victory. The Rangers almost lost another goalie to injury in the final game when Miller was badly cut while Murray Murdoch attempted to clear a loose puck away from goal, but he was able to continue. The crowd became unruly in the third period, throwing objects onto the ice after referee Mike Rodden disallowed an apparent game-tying goal by the Maroons. Even NHL president Frank Calder was a target of some fans immediately following the game. The Rangers became the second Stanley Cup champion from the United States, and the NHL's first American Cup-winning team.

Villanueva, Zacatecas

Villanueva is a town in the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. It is the administrative seat of the Municipality of Villanueva.
Name.
Villanueva was founded on February 4, 1692 under the name "Villagutierre del Águila". Like many towns in Mexico the name of the patron saint of the town was added to the name and it became "Villa de San Judas Tadeo de Villa Gutierre del Águila". However, since it was the last town founded in that area of Zacatecas, it was called "Villa Nueva (new town)", and that is the name that stuck.
Geography.
Villanueva is one of the 58 municipalities of the Mexican state of Zacatecas. It is located at the southern part of Zacatecas and is bordered in all directions by a number of Zacatecas municipalities. Among the municipalities bordering it are Jerez to the north, Genero Codina to the east, Tabasco to the south and Tepetongo to the west. Some parts of Villanueva have mountainous terrains. It is also crossed by different rivers and other bodies of fresh water. It has a sub-humid temperature and an annual average of 16.9°C.
History.
The municipality was originally called Santa Cruz when it was founded in 1650. Its name was changed a couple of times until 1962, when it was officially renamed as the Municipality of Villanueva, its name until the present. Its seal is one of the oldest in Zacatecas, dating back as early as the early 19th century. The motto of the town is the Latin translation of “With the sword and the plow”. It is because Villanueva began as an agriculture and labor-based community and produced some of the bravest patriots in Mexico. Once a colonial town, Villanueva only became a free municipality in the year 1917. As of 2005, Villanueva had a population of 28,760 residents. The majority of these residents are Roman Catholics by faith.
Economy and culture.
The primary sources of income in Villanueva are agriculture, cattle raising and fishing. Following it are the manufacturing, construction and electricity industry. Commerce and tourism over the years have also become sources of income for the municipality. Villanueva has great potential to be developed as a tourism hot spot because of its attractive colonial architecture. It has plenty of historical sites to visit. Among these are pre-Hispanic petroglyphs, the properties of the old colonial invaders, the parochial temple of San Judas Tadeo, the Municipal Palace and a whole lot more. The annual feast from October 20–28 is also one of the most joyous celebrations in Villanueva. It is held in honor of their patron saint San Judas Tadeo and is reveled with merriment, dances, food and games. Some popular events are the Fair of Tayahua every March 14–20 and the religious celebration of the Incarnation of The Blessed Virgin Mary of Carmen every July 16 among others.
Culture.
People in Villanueva are musically inclined. In fact, it is the place of origin of the musical instrument called tamborazo. It is also rich in craft products such as wood and leather furniture. The place also has a number of original delicious Mexican recipes to feast on. On account of its many vacation attractions, it has been a preference by both local and foreign tourists. To cater to the tourists that flock Villanueva ever year, the municipality has ensured that there is available a number of resorts, spas and activities to accommodate their guests.
Villanueva, is well known for its music and rich culture. Villanueva has one of the largest "Unidad Deportivas" in the state of Zacatecas.

Wittelsbach-Graff Diamond

The Wittelsbach-Graff Diamond is a fancy deep-blue diamond with internally flawless clarity. Laurence Graff purchased the Wittelsbach Diamond in 2008 for £16.4 million. In 2010, Graff revealed he had had the diamond cut by three diamond cutters to remove flaws. The diamond was now more than lighter and was renamed the Wittelsbach-Graff Diamond. There is controversy, as critics claim the recutting has so altered the diamond as to make it unrecognizable, compromising its historical integrity.
Wittelsbach Diamond.
The original Wittelsbach Diamond, also known as Der Blaue Wittelsbacher, was a fancy, deep, grayish-blue diamond with VS2 clarity that had been part of both the Austrian and the Bavarian Crown jewels.
Its color and clarity had been compared to the Hope Diamond. The diamond had measured in diameter and in depth. It had 82 facets arranged in an atypical pattern. The star facets on the crown were vertically split, and the pavilion had sixteen needle-like facets arranged in pairs, pointing outward from the culet facet.
History.
The diamond originates from the Kollur mines of Guntur District in Andhra Pradesh. The story that King Philip IV of Spain purchased the jewel and included it in the dowry of his teenage daughter, Margaret Teresa, in 1664 is apocryphal. The first time the diamond was mentioned is about fifty years later when it was already in Vienna. It was in the possession of the Habsburg family and came to Munich when, in 1722, Maria Amalia married Charles of Bavaria, a member of the Wittelsbach family.
In 1745, the Wittelsbach Diamond was first mounted on the Bavarian Elector's Order of the Golden Fleece. When Maximilian IV Joseph von Wittelsbach became the first King of Bavaria in 1806, he commissioned a royal crown that prominently displayed the diamond. Until 1918, the jewel remained on top of the Bavarian crown. It was seen last in public at Ludwig III of Bavaria's funeral in 1921.
The Wittelsbach family tried to sell the diamond in 1931 during the Great Depression but found no buyers. It eventually sold the jewel in 1951. In 1958, the stone was exhibited at the World Expo in Brussels. In the 1960s, the Goldmuntz family asked Joseph Komkommer, a jeweler, to re-cut the diamond, but Komkommer recognized its historical significance and refused. Instead, he joined a group of dealers that bought it. The diamond had been in a private collection since 1964; Helmut Horten had presented to his wife Heidi at their wedding.
On 10 December 2008, the Wittelsbach Diamond was sold to London-based jeweler Laurence Graff for £16.4 million sterling, or US$23.4 million, at the time the highest price ever paid at auction for a diamond. (The previous record had been held by a pear-shaped stone named the Star of the Season.) The record was eclipsed on 16 November, 2010, when a 24.78 carat pink diamond was sold for £29 million Sterling, or US$46 million, again to Mr. Graff.
In June 2011, Graff apparently sold the diamond to the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Chalifa, for at least US$80 million.
Alteration.
Immediately following the sale, Graff announced his intention to recut the gem to remove damage to the girdle and enhance the color.
On 7 January 2010, it was reported that the diamond had been recut to enhance the stone's color and clarity, losing over in the process. The resulting stone has been renamed the Wittelsbach-Graff. The move was met with heavy criticism by some experts: Gabriel Tolkowsky called it "the end of culture." Shortly after the auction of the diamond, American gem cutter and replicator of famous diamonds Scott Sucher stated, "In the case of the Wittelsbach, what's at stake is at minimum over 350 years of history, as every nick, chip, and scratch has a story to tell. Just because we can’t decipher these stories doesn’t mean they don’t exist." The alteration of the historical stone has been compared by Professor Hans Ottomeyer, director of the Deutsches Historisches Museum of Berlin, to the overpainting of a painting by Rembrandt. It is opined that the recutting was done to increase its market value and, by extension, that of other "fancy diamonds". As a result of the recut, which removed some chips and reduced the size of the culet by 40%, the gem has been reevaluated by the Gemological Institute of America and its color grade revised from "fancy deep grayish-blue", the same grade given by GIA to The Hope, to the more desirable "fancy deep blue". The diamond’s clarity had also been revised upward from "very slightly included" (VS1) to "internally flawless" (IF).

J. Harold Murray

J. Harold Murray (February 17, 1891 - December 11, 1940) was an American baritone. For more than a decade, during the Roaring Twenties and the Depression Thirties, he contributed to the development of musical theater by bridging vaudeville, operetta and the modern American musical. The most popular American songs he introduced on Broadway included "Autumn in New York" (1934, "Thumbs Up!", words and music by Vernon Duke); "Let's Have Another Cup of Coffee" and "Soft Lights and Sweet Music" (1932, "Face the Music", Moss Hart and Irving Berlin); "Rio Rita", "The Kinkajou" and "The Rangers Song" (1927, "Rio Rita", Harry Tierney and Joseph McCarthy); and "Mandalay" (1921, "The Whirl of New York", (Gustave Kerker, Hugh Morton and Edgar Smith).
Biography.
Born Harry Rulten on February 17, 1891 in South Berwick, Maine, "Hal" Murray served in the Merchant Marine during World War I. After the war and a short apprenticeship in vaudeville, he made his debut on the musical theatre stage as J. Harold Murray in out-of-town productions of Arthur Hammerstein's "Always You" and Frank Tinney's "Sometime", both in 1920. He debuted on Broadway at the age of 30 in J.J. Shubert's, "The Passing Show of 1921". During the rest of the decade, he starred in 10 musicals, and separately co-starred with Eddie Cantor ("Make It Snappy", 1922), Fred Allen ("Vogues of 1924") and Joe E. Brown ("Captain Jinks", 1925). Other shows were: "The Midnight Rounders of 1921", "The Whirl of New York" (1921), "Springtime of Youth" (1922), "Caroline" (1923), "China Rose" (1925) with Olga Steck, and "Castles in the Air" (1926) with Vivienne Segal. In February 1927, he starred in "Rio Rita," a Flo Ziegfeld production, which was so successful after it opened the Ziegfeld Theatre that the musical "Show Boat," which had been scheduled to open in April, was delayed until the end of the year. In Hollywood from 1929–30, he appeared in the William Fox Studio musicals: "Cameo Kirby" with Norma Terris; "Happy Days"; "Married In Hollywood" with Norma Terris; "Women Everywhere" with Fifi D'Orsay; and "Under Suspicion".
Returning to New York City, Hal starred in the Moss Hart-Irving Berlin musical "Face the Music," Oscar Hammerstein II's "East Wind,", "Thumbs Up," and "Venus in Silk", a Laurence Schwab operetta that closed out-of-town (Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C.) before reaching Broadway. Murray retired from the Broadway stage in 1935. He sang on a Hartford, Conn. radio show weekly for three years. He also was active in business, summer stock ("The Only Girl," 1938; "Knickerbocker Holiday," 1939, at The Player's Theatre, Clinton, Connecticut); and performed in several musical film shorts for Universal Pictures ("Nite in a Night Club," 1934; "The Singing Bandit," 1937; "Somewhere in Paris," 1938; "Wild and Bully" 1939), RKO ("Phony Boy," 1937; "Under a Gypsy Moon" 1938) and Vitaphone ("Who Was That Girl," 1934; "The Flame Song," 1934) during the next five years, Murray developed nephritis in the spring of 1940. He died of the disease on December 11 at the age of 49.
Modern theater musicals emerged from vaudeville and operettas, and J. Harold Murray played an important role in their early development. His acting and strong baritone performances of songs, such as "Rio Rita", "The Ranger’s Song", "Let’s Have Another Cup of Coffee", "Soft Lights and Sweet Music", and "New York in Autumn" were notable then, and his introducing them on the Broadway stage contributed to their withstanding the test of time into the 21st Century.

Hazen Sise

Hazen E. Sise (1906–1974) was a Canadian architect, educator, and humanitarian.
Early life and education.
Sise was born in 1906 in Montreal, Quebec. His father was the President of the Northern Electric Company. He attended the Selwyn House School in Montreal and Bishop's College in Lennoxville, Quebec. He studied at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario but left after his second year because he decided to become an architect. He was greatly influenced to study architecture by discovering wonderful folios of the works of Christopher Wren in the Royal Military College of Canada library. He was able to transfer from second-year at Royal Military College into second-year at the School of Architecture at McGill University. After two years of study at McGill (1925–27), he transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge where he graduated in 1929. After graduation, he went to London, England, to do post-graduate studies in architecture and town planning.
Career.
He was employed at Le Corbusier’s architectural office in Paris, France, and the Howe and Lescaze firm in New York City. Upon his return to Montreal in 1931, he participated in the establishment the Atelier school, which held art classes, lectures and exhibitions. The Atelier School's aim was to bring together artists interested in modern painting, while stressing the importance of classical principles in art, and the art of the European moderns. He wrote, 'The essential qualities of a work of art lie in the relationships of form to form, and of colour to colour. From these the eye, and especially the trained eye derives its pleasure and all artistic emotion must find its expression through these means.' He was involved in the arts and theatre communities in Montreal. He regularly attended the gatherings held at painter John Lyman’s home, developing friendships with artists such as André Biéler, Jean Palardy, and Jori Smith. He participated in the Fourth International Congress of Modern Architecture in Athens. He was interested in creating a link between the artist and the public, for example through the promotion of mural painting. 
He was interested in the international situation during the thirties. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, he joined Dr. Norman Bethune in Madrid, Spain and became the chief fundraiser for the Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy. He joined the Canadian Blood Transfusion Unit attached to the "Loyalists." He often drove a Red Cross Ambulance (1936-9). He became the chief fundraiser for the Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy. 
Returning to Canada just before the beginning of World War II, he joined the Staff of the National Film Board of Canada serving first in Ottawa, Ontario and later in Washington, D.C. After the war, he was invited to give lectures in architectural history at McGill University School of Architecture. Since he was engaged in the practice of the profession of architecture, his practical experience complemented theoretical studies. In Montreal, he was an active member of the city's Parks and Playgrounds Association, contributing to the restoration and preservation of urban open spaces. He cofounded the architectural co-operative known as Arcop, the successor firm to Affleck, Desbarats, Dimakopoulos, Lebensold, Sise in 1955. He was an outspoken advocate of social justice and a faithful follower of the modern movement. 
He was concerned with the furtherance of modern art and architecture, not only in Montreal but across Canada. In 1968, he retired from the architectural co-operative.
Later life.
From 1970-74, he consulted with the National Capital Commission on saving of traditional architecture.
He died in 1974.

ABOUT THE YESHIVA
Yeshiva Etzion is a place that prepares the talmidim not only to learn Torah but to be ready for the world. A Bachur that comes to the Yeshiva will be ready for the challenges that lie ahead of him. The Yeshiva is geared to the serious Bachur who is attending college yet wants to learn Torah and grow. Some of the unique aspects of the Yeshiva are as follows;
At Yeshiva Etzion we view Torah as a way of life.
Yeshiva for College Students.
The argument of how to pursue a secular education and yet learn Torah at the same time is an old and controversial question in Jewish philosophy. From the times of the codification of the Tanach in the early second temple era, there were books designated as "seforim chitzonim" or books outside of Jewish study. It was forbidden to study these works and reading them could subject the reader to the title of "epikorus" (heretic). Since that time, there has been a strong reactionary trend against secular study from within traditional Jewry. Notable exceptions include Maimonides who insists that the only true way to appreciate God's wisdom is to study the natural world. Notwithstanding the philosophical battle which rages until today, there are a great many Jewish students in college today, carrying an enormous challenge of being part of an ancient culture and modern society at the same time.
Tuition.
In ancient times the teachers of Judaism did not accept payment for studies outside of the written Bible(). This is because it is impossible for a student to pay a teacher back for bringing meaning into the student's life. Yeshiva Etzion follows this very ancient system of tuition-free teaching. In practice, the students donate to the continuance of the yeshiva by tithes or other forms of donation- sometimes monetary but also by using their expertise in various fields for the furtherance of Torah study. This is more in line with the traditional Jewish system.
Methodology.
The explicit aim of Yeshiva Etzion is to answer practical questions from an authentically Jewish perspective. This represents an ancient philosophical approach described in the Talmud as "Torah Lema'aseh" - practical Torah learning. Of course, all topics of the Torah are equally important, even the ones that do not have any practical use. However, many proponents of Torah Lishmah - Torah for its own sake feel that to mix Torah with anything from the outside world is blasphemy. However, this was not the approach of Maimonides, as is obvious from even a cursory glance at The Guide for the Perplexed. Now, this does not mean that the Torah Lishmah proponents who do not use Maimonides' approach do not conduct their lives according to the Torah. Of course they do, because all Orthodox Jews try to keep the Halakha in every aspect of their lives - both Torah study and business activities and other worldly matters. The mistake, therefore, is as follows: by not believing that other topics of study have any truth in and of themselves they confine the Torah to a very small sphere. Yeshiva Etzion's philosophy, and Maimonides' philosophy (in this regard) is the opposite, that through finding truth in many various fields, one's understanding of God, and therefore one's understanding of God's Torah, is enlightened. So the approach of Yeshiva Etzion is threefold: to study "impractical" aspects of the Torah, to study "practical" aspects of the Torah and to incorporate these in your life, and finally to study the world as per Maimonides and incorporate that knowledge into your understanding of God and God's Torah. As such the subject matter dealt with in the Yeshiva lectures range from "impractical" Jewish law to "practical" Jewish law to important philosophical matters that affect the students of the Yeshiva directly and help the students in their understanding of the Torah. As in all Yeshivot, the strong tradition of Jewish textual scholarship figures prominently in discussions on these topics and it is not uncommon for tens, perhaps hundreds of sources to be consulted over the course of the lectures on the topic—which may sometimes take weeks to bring to full closure.
The yeshiva developed a unique method of working with the young me. this method is the famous C.D.B System
The CDB SYSTEM c stands for,
Commitment
In turbulent and uncertain times there is comfort in routine and regularity. Our staff guides the Talmidim to establish stability through the development of commitment. This becomes intrinsic and helps achieve a well rounded Torah oriented Jewish life through learning and actual practice. Commitment comes easier only in a yeshiva that understands the needs of a serious student and his interaction with the academic world.
Dedication
The Talmid learns to integrate the components of his life by prioritizing. The dedication of Rabbanim, Hanhala, and his fellow talmidim are models that propel his own dedication to a new level. He becomes able to rise to the challenges of his life by seeing the other Talmidim successfully managing demanding schedules. Life is informed by a Torah perspective, and dedicating time for Torah in their days becomes an intrinsic priority. Such dedication teaches a sense of responsibility and is also a source of inner strength. 
Balance
We teach our young men to create their own ideal balance between the world of Kodesh and Chol by tapping into the inner strength they have developed through commitment and dedication. Our well rounded and diverse curriculum and teaching methods are designed to increase their knowledge base in all aspects of the Torah. We regularly discuss the pressing issues of the day and the Torah perspective on them, which further helps the Talmid achieve a solid balance in the outside world by knowing how to appropriately respond to different interactions and situations that may arise. We aid the Talmidim to be able to navigate the waters outside the Beit Medrash. Guiding the Talmid to understand the meaning behind each action we take as Jews helps him answer both the internal questions and those he may be asked as a representative of the frum world. Working with every Talmid on an individual basis allows us to pinpoint both strengths and weaknesses in each bachur and helps the Rabbanim to identify strategies to assist in achieving inner balance.
The famous line of the yeshiva is
"Don’t ask us if the CDB system works, ask our Talmidim."
Students.
Yeshiva Etzion's students are found in diverse fields as biotechnology, education,law and even pop music. The student body itself is diverse with students from Afghanistan, America, India, Iran, Israel, & Uzbekistan.

The Minds of Marginalized Black Men

The Minds of Marginalized Black Men is a non-fiction book written by Alford A. Young Jr. Young explores the lives of impoverished young black men living in the near New West Side of Chicago in order to get a better understanding of how they view their lives and what they want for their futures.

Tito -a survivor of Near West Side who was able to work with a moving company for a short period of time. Eventually he began gangbanging, and was incarcerated.
Introduction - Making New Sense of Poor Black Men in Crisis.
The introduction gives us a really good insight on what is to come later in the book. It also gives a good explanation about the setting and how Young did he research. <br>
The Setting <br>
Young conducted his research in a couple different public housing developments in the Near West Side of Chicago. Young describes the area as "geographically and socially isolated from downtown Chicago and the opulent western suburbs, and resembles a holding pen for the economically immobile." The first development that Young went to was the Governor Henry Horner Homes. The development had "19 buildings with 1,774 units, almost all of which are occupied by African Americans." 
In these households over 85% received public assistance, and only 8% were able to be supported by the employment of a member of the household. The second development was the ABLA homes which is located 1 and a half miles away from the Henry Horner Homes. The ABLA development contains 160 buildings with 3,505 units and just like the Henry Horner homes ABLA is almost all African American. ABLA occupants do a little bit better financially with 75% needing public assistance and a little over 8% able to support themselves. 
The Mandate <br>
The other half of the introduction talks about what made Young want to research and write this book and what the main ideas of the book are. Young says that the main goal of this book is to "uncover these men's worldviews on issues such as mobility, opportunity, and future life chances." So this book is not about what was going through these men's heads when they were dealing drugs or carrying a firearm but instead about how they view the place in American society and what they think about their futures.
Chapter 1 - The Past and Future of the Cultural Analysis of Black Men.
Chapter one starts off by going into the idea of "the crisis of the black male" which is the idea that the rate of crime and incarceration among blacks is directly connected to the high rate of unemployment among blacks. Young attributes the crisis to two key factors; structural and cultural. Structural meaning race-based residential segregations and mobility prospect. Cultural meaning attitudes and behaviors that culture sees that prevent acceptance into the work world. 
Young then talks about how most research on poor black males only focuses on behavioral traits and their value systems. He then goes on to say that good research would include those aspects but also include a deep analysis of how these men create their worldviews and beliefs regarding the present and future. Cultural analysis is the main topic of a huge debate right now. On one side "the debate asks whether black men adopt or promote distinct cultural patters that contribute to, if not cause altogether, their demise. 
The other side questions "whether these men, who are taken to be cultural actors in the wayrs that other groups of Americans are, might simply experience unique life circumstances and conditions that overdetermine the social outcomes comprising their everyday lives." Young then finishes off the chapter talking about "Social Isolation" which is the idea that these poor young black men are unable to get jobs because their class standing keeps them away from mainstream society. They are isolated from the area where all the jobs and opportunities are.
Chapter 2 - Time, Space, and Everyday Living.
Chapter 2 looks at the everyday lives of these men. Uncertainty is a common feeling for these men because each day they must worry about if they will have a job or if they will even make it through the day. One thing in this chapter that really surprised Young was the men's inability to manage time. People would show up late, extremely early, or even on the wrong days to interviews. These men do not have to deal with appointments on an everyday basis so they did not know how to handle it because the majority of their days they have nothing to do. 
Young brings up the concept of "Habitus", which is a "system of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles which generate and organize practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mastery of the operations necessary in order to attain them." The basically means that the way people think and act is related to the social constraints and structures around them. 
Young gives the example of how the use of violence in order to defend yourself is a justifiable in certain situations. Young was surprised by how much these people have to deal with violence. He talks about how in most communities violence is a rare assurance but in the Near West Side it has become part of the daily lives of the people. Most people only feel unsafe when they go out late at night but people in the Near West Side feel like that all day, even in their own homes.
Chapter 3 - Coming Up Poor.
Coming up poor addresses the issue of the young African American men developing their futures through the obstacles of growing up in Near West Side. The most common obstacle that most of the men experienced were the lack of decent finances, a father figure, a sense of security, and the proper information to lead them to college. Young men are interviewed and asked to describe what it was like trying to grow up in the community, and what kind of support did they receive from their family to pursue an education beyond high school. 
The men speak of how growing up, the community was extremely violent, and quite often the children in elementary school had other things on their mind other than getting a quality education. Survival of the gang infested area, the home that was full of stress and anxiety due to the lack of money, and earning the respect of peers no matter what it took were the main focuses of these adolescents. When asked about their parental figure(s) attitude towards achieving a higher level of education they all had the same answer. All of the parents highly stressed how important it was to receive a quality education and stay off the streets and out of gangs. Although their parents wanted nothing more for their children but to grow up and do something with their life, the parents themselves were unable to provide concrete information or help to guide the children in the correct direction. 
Some parents overprotected their children to the point where the child would sneak out to the streets and was exposed to all of the gang violence. Since the streets were so terrible, one often found a sense of safety and security only in joining a gang to avoid being the recipient of a soft reputation. To find security in the streets one had to gain the respect of the surrounding peers. When kids are bullying, stealing, and dealing with drugs when in elementary school, the future for that generation is very limited to those who can stay away and deal with the conflicts another way. The local high school had an enrollment of 97 percent African Americans, and during the 1980s the percent that received a high school diploma only ranged from 15 percent to no more than 30 percent. 
The high school couldn't provide what one would call a safe and educational learning environment for many different reasons. During daily instruction students would have to halt their studies and duck beneath their desks because of gunfire in the streets. With instability such as this one can only imagine the quality of an education that a student could receive, this is why the percent of students intelligent enough to attend college ranged from 10 percent to no more than 40 percent. This doesn't mean that those eligible to go to college were able to afford it considering that 95 percent of the students came from low-income families that needed financial assistance to survive. 
Once these boys became men and were still stuck in the city the believed that they had survived the most challenging part of growing up in the city. Now they were off to the workforce, where many were unable to keep steady jobs. With the morals and mindsets that the men acquired growing up, they were bound to lose their jobs sooner or later as they valued the respect of their employees more than the importance of getting the job done. The men are extremely affected by their adolescent years and are now struggling to provide for children of their own. This cycle seems to continue as the elders always stress the importance of a quality education; the only challenge is learning how to get it.
Chapter 4 - Framing Social Reality: Stratification and Inequality.
Chapter four focuses on determining what the men's interpretive thoughts are on characteristics of society such as power, hierarchy, and social relations across race and class lines. Rather than focusing on each of the men's intellectual abilities, the author mainly focuses on each of the men's personal experiences. By analyzing the differences in opinions the author strives to figure out how differences in personal experiences connect to the kinds of interpretations that the men have. 
One man in particular that has an extremely interesting outlook on the American Society is Barry. Barry received his high school diploma but fell into the unfortunate act of drug dealing soon after graduating. He talks about how much he regrets doing it, but he needed the money then, and that was the easiest way to get it. When asked if he believed that discrimination existed, he was the only one that didn't believe that it was present. He believed that you are discriminated against only if you allow yourself to be. In other words, he was saying that you determine your own fate. Barry believed that he could have done something far better with his life had he only refused to take no for an answer and been more determined. It was very surprising that seeing the position that Barry was in, he had so little to say about the existence of discrimination obstacles and barriers towards upward mobility. 
Donald, another man who was interviewed had a completely different outlook on these questions. Donald grew up working small jobs at a variety of business's and although he wasn't a part of the wealthier society, he viewed it from his position. He stated that he viewed racism and discrimination all the time, and he believes that's why he was fired from some of his jobs. He believes that as long as there are different wealth classes these unfortunate aspects of society are always going to remain. 
In conclusion we can see that it is not the intelligence of these men that allow them to answer the questions thoroughly, but their personal experiences that they are able to talk about. Barry doesn't believe that there is discrimination and racism because has never traveled far from Near West Side. Donald on the other hand has worked outside of the city and has viewed and experienced the life-style of other classes. He is aware that other classes exist, and has experienced discrimination himself.
Chapter 5 - Framing Individual Mobility and Attainment.
Chapter five addresses the recurring thoughts about how low-income African American men make sense of mobility and attainment in American society. Its main focus is to help determining what we can do to enhance these men's thoughts on advancement in society. Through the information acquired during the interviews, it seems as though the men's ability to imagine aspects of life that are present further out in society such as mobility barriers and discrimination are often limited to what they have experienced in Near West Side. 
The men were asked about their thoughts of mobility and attainment in the country, and they were mostly split into two categories. Those who knew little about it and didn't have much to say, and those who had passionate responses towards why they believed there were barriers and discrimination in society. Half of the men hadn't been fortunate enough to have a job because of their lack of motivation, or qualifications. 
These men, being isolated were least likely to speak of the role that outside forces play in shaping a person's chances in life. On the other hand, the men that were a part of some sort of employment had completely different thoughts on mobility and attainment. The men with more work experience were often those that experienced social conflicts themselves and were able to talk thoroughly about their beliefs on how the role of external factors did affect an individuals chances in life.
Chapter 6 - Looking Up from Below: Framing Personal Reality.
Chapter six focuses on the aspect of self-identification. Finding and stating who you are as a person and what you want your mission in life and goals to be; and how to mobilize oneself in society in order to achieve these goals. Different aspects of the stereotypical ideal future or "good life" are mentioned. This ideal future mentioned touches on the three spheres of life: work, home, and individual well-being. In this stage of self-identification, a specific profession is not addressed; instead the goal is to attain whatever fits the individual's definition of a well-paying job. 
There is a strong emphasis on personal mobility and opportunity and that they are the key basis for aspirations or the 'ideal" future. The author, Young, Jr. touches on the essential points of using any resources that are possible in order to mobilize yourself on a small scale, and to in time give yourself and opportunity on a larger scale. An example given is of Arthur working at a liquor store to get an idea of how to set up his own business. Young, Jr. analyzes the men's lack of social capital in the world of work, by saying that the men have an insufficient in the human capital of strategic skills and talents. 
The world of work is shown as a world of, education, brainpower and skill, and certification credentials; which are resources for success in the working world. The attributes of just strength and physical stamina have very little importance in the white-collar environment. In conclusion of this chapter, the men's perceptions of their own skills shows that most of the men would remain eligible for minimal skill positions.
Chapter 7 - Getting There: Navigating Personal Mobility.
"Getting There" focuses on the aspects of personal mobility, personal impediments of getting ahead, and the special place of race in class. Chapter seven briefly touches on and concludes the men's discussion on the modern-day America and the American Dream. They touch on the emphasizing factors of, discipline, hard work, education, and motivation. 
The men believe that a high school diploma is a bare essential towards minimal success in the working world, but that the only useful education was direct training to one's career interests. The men then move on to confronting and acknowledging their own self-induced barriers. Men like Gus and Casey talk about their struggles with substance abuse, and the problems that it caused for them as far as being motivated let alone difficult to acquire any type of working opportunities. 
Additionally, men that had been previously incarcerated such as Devin, Earl, Lester, and Casey, talk about the disadvantages to having a criminal record, and the difficulty of trying to find and take advantage of working opportunities as a result of that. The men then move on to discuss the difficulty of personal mobility. They discuss how being African American puts them in a lower class with less resources and opportunities, thus making it harder for them to mobilize and to make something of themselves with less difficulty. In conclusion this chapter has a very present theme of social isolation.
Chapter 8 - Recasting the Crisis of Poor Black Men.
Chapter eight starts off with some funny yet interesting words from a man by the name of Vance Smith. Smith said "That's retarded to think that men do not know how to take control of their lives. People actually think like that? I mean, people with Ph.D's and shit." People who think that a black man cannot be responsible for their lives are extremely wrong. This book has shown us that these poor black men have plans to improve themselves and have hopes and dreams they just lack the skills and capital to better themselves. They are many things that need to be done before these people can live better lives. 
A key one would be a stable labor market with good job training. But the likely hood of that happening is small because the majority of people view this community with the idea of "three strikes and your out." That these people had their chance and chose to cheat and therefore put themselves in the situation that they are in and we should not have to help them. The last main point in the book is that as times change and their situation changes the way researchers and people view that area needs to change with it otherwise they will never be able to get out of the hole that they are in.

Nāradasmṛti

The is a part of the Dharmaśāstras, an Indian literary tradition that serves as a collection of legal maxims relating to the topic of dharma. This text is purely juridical in character in that it focuses solely on procedural and substantive law. Known as the "juridical text par excellence," the is the only Dharmaśāstra text to not cover areas such as righteous conduct and penance. Its focused nature has made the text highly valued by rulers and their governments, likely as an aid of carrying out their dharma of justly ruling the country.
Recensions of the Text.
Today there exist three recognized versions of this text. First, there is the “minor” or “Vulgate” recension, consisting of 879 verses and referred to by the siglum D. Next comes the recension known by the siglum P and consisting originally of 550 verses. Jolly later edited the text to contain verses from the “minor” recension as well, bringing the total to 1028 verses. The third version comes from the Newārī manuscripts and the and goes by the siglum NMS, containing 870 verses. Each recension is unique not only in length, but content as well. For example, in P, an entire chapter is found of which no other manuscript makes mention. One of the most thoroughly studied differences is that of the variation in naming of Ordeals. The NMS, seen as the oldest of the three texts, lists only two ordeals in the standard chapter on “Nonpayment of Debt” but contains an addendum which lists five more ordeals. The Vulgate also lists five ordeals but manuscript P adds two more, bringing the total to seven.
Source and Authority.
One recension claims that “Manu Prajāpati originally composed a text in 100,000 verses and 1080 chapters, which was successively abridged by the sages Nārada, Mārkandeya, and Sumati Bhārgava, down to a text of 4,000 verses.” If this is true, the would represent the ninth chapter, regarding legal procedure, of Manu’s original text. This connection to Manu gives increased legitimacy to the because Indian tradition holds that statements made by Manu regarding dharma are “above challenge”. Lariviere notes that it is clear from the critical edition and examination of other ancient documents that this explanation of Nāradasmṛti's origin is a myth, and was added later.
The divine sage Nārada is known as the messenger of the gods, transmitting divine will to the people of the earth. Although not known for being an expert in dharma, he has been portrayed as an instructor of law and politics.
Author.
Lariviere argues that there was “no single ‘author’ of this text” but rather, either an individual or a group who compiled all of the verses attributed by a particular community to the sage Nārada. Examination of the scripts of the original manuscript determines that the manuscripts were written in the South of India while the Newārī manuscript came from Nepal. The recensions D and P appear to have been found throughout the subcontinent but rarely in Nepal or Kerala.
Date.
Similar to all ancient Indian texts, specific dates for the authoring of the continue to elude scholars. Varying arguments have been made and evidences cited but no decisive conclusions have been made. The best timeframe which can be provided is somewhere between 100BC and 400CE.
In 1876 manuscript D of the was translated by the German scholar, Julius Jolly, making it available to legal scholars in Europe for the first time. The work was readily accepted in Europe due to its style, content, and structure which was similar enough to Roman legal texts of the time that the scholars felt comfortable dealing with it. Karl Marx even used this translation as a reference for his Asiatic Modes of Production.
In 1879, Jolly translated manuscript P.
In 1989, Lariviere revisited the text and produced a critical translation which includes evidence from the NWS manuscripts, as well as D and P, which Jolly used.
Structure.
The structure of the is based on the eighteen titles of law, which are also mentioned in the Manusmṛti but with some variation in names. The text begins with a brief introduction into law and the courts before delving into these 18 titles, devoting a chapter to each. The way in which this text is written makes it clear that the author(s) was appealing to a community of practitioners, interested in directly applying the law to every day cases.

Emile Boeres

Jean-Pierre Emile Boeres (1890–1944) was a Luxembourg composer, organist and choir master.
Born on 13 November 1890 in Luxembourg City, he wrote operettas and musical comedies in Luxembourgish. In 1934, he founded the "Wiener Operette" and the "Lëtzebuerger Musekerverband". He also contributed to the "Lëtzebuerger Revue".
During the German occupation, the Théâtre des Capucins put on operas, ballets and plays in German but the German authorities were very wary of productions in Luxembourgish which were considered anti-German. On 18 November 1940, Boeres' operetta "Wann d'Blieder falen" (When the leaves fall) enjoyed a huge success as the audience sought to show its support for a free Luxembourg by attending a performance in the Luxembourg language.
Boeres died in Luxembourg City on 18 August 1944 after a cycling accident.

<doc id="20600923" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20600923" title="Passau Hauptbahnhof">
Passau Hauptbahnhof

Passau Hauptbahnhof is the main railway station at Passau in Bavaria, Germany. Built in 1860, it has eight platforms, of which three are bay platforms and three are through tracks. The ca. 130 m long station building is built in the classic style.
Present-day services.
Today the station is a stop for ICE and IC long-distance trains, as well as local trains operated by Deutsche Bahn (DB AG) and the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB). From Passau, regional services run to Munich, Regensburg and on the "Rottalbahn" to Mühldorf am Inn and the Austrian Western Railway to Wels and Linz.
Because Passau was on the trunk route ("Magistrale") from Frankfurt am Main via Nuremberg and Linz to Vienna, many long-distance trains transited through it, such as the Ostende to Vienna Express (since the early 20th century) or the TEE "Prinz Eugen" between Hamburg and Vienna (since the 1960s), which gave its name later to the equivalent IC and then ICE trains.
Former railway lines.
From the Hauptbahnhof in Passau two railway lines branch off that have since been closed. The "Ilztalbahn" to Waldkirchen and Freyung, with its former branch into the Czech Republic and to Eging am See and Deggendorf, and the line to Hauzenberg with its branch to Obernzell, that ran as far as Wegscheid in former times. These routes, which had not been worked by timetabled services for 25 years, were used until 2002 by the Passauer Eisenbahnfreunde ("Passau Railway Society") for special trains, as well as by the goods trains of various companies. After 2002 the routes became impassable due to flood damage. Meanwhile societies have been formed to support the lines to Freyung and Hauzenberg and they hope to reactivate these routes.
Former track layout.
West of the main passenger terminal on the site of the former marshalling yard is a large freight station that serves the cross-border goods traffic between Germany and Austria as well as the cross-loading of goods to ships that ply the river Danube. To the east, the remaining storage sidings and locomotive shed were dismantled in order to create the "new centre of Passau" "Neue Mitte Passau".
Station rebuilding.
It was planned to convert the station to a barrier-free zone from 2008 to mid-2011 with a subsidy from the Free State of Bavaria of €2M towards the overall cost of €12.5M. The two island platforms as well as the home platform were to have been reached by a lift, and platforms 5 and 6 over the so-called "Poststeg" ("post office walkway") which would have considerably shortened the distance to the Central Bus Station in the new centre of Passau. In addition the home platform was to have been raised by about 76 cm and the underpass widened.
These plans were however changed during the course of 2008, because they would not have coped with the very high number of tourists at the station, especially those using the Danube crossings.
Joint DB/ÖBB use.
Since 1951 the station has been used by the ÖBB and DB jointly as an internal station. For that reason there were two separate pedestrian underpasses under the tracks, separated by a wall, that enabled border and customs checks to be carried out. Since the entry of Austria into the EU in 1995 and the associated scrapping of these checks, this wall has been removed apart from a small section. On this section of wall there is a memorial tablet for the two policemen, Klaus März and Georg Schachner, who were murdered on 11 November 1993 in an Intercity from Linz to Passau near Schärding.
Above the tracks since 1975 stands the first "bridge post office" in Germany.

Abu Dhabi Film Festival

Abu Dhabi Film Festival (ADFF) (), formerly Middle East International Film Festival, is an international film festival which started in 2007. The event is held annually in October in the city of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The ADFF aims to showcase the best films from the region alongside standout productions from prominent international filmmakers. Since 2012, the festival has been part of the Abu Dhabi Media Zone Authority, specifically under Media Zone Events and powered by its partner company, twofour54.
Inaugural festival.
The first festival debuted with 152 movies and 186 screenings shown in five Abu Dhabi venues. A total of 76 feature films and 34 short films from over 35 countries competed for the Black Pearl Awards. Well-known celebrities who showed up for the awards were: Michael Gaston, the British actor Joseph Fiennes, and well known French actress, and Eva Green. Some of the Arabic personalities who attended were:Muna Wassef, Yousra, Elham Shaeen, Mostafa Shaban, and Abdulaiziz Al Jazem. The initial MEIFF was produced by Egyptian celebrity host Nashwa Al-Ruwaini. After the 2008 festival, Al-Ruwaini was removed and now serves on the advisory board, and Peter Scarlet, formerly of the Tribeca Film Festival, assumed duties in 2009.
Re-branding.
In 2010, UAE based Brash Brands www.brashbrands.com assisted ADACH to develop the Festival's brand, allowing it to compete more effectively with Dubai Film Festival, Doha Tribeca Film Festival, Cannes, etc. With the changes came the move from MEIFF to Abu Dhabi Film Festival.
Headlining features.
With a new branding scheme, and in its second year under the command of Executive Director Peter Scarlet, the 2010 ADFF is making a strong effort to breakout from a cluttered festival junket in the Gulf Region. This year there are six feature films and two documentaries that are attracting a considerable amount of industry buzz.
"In a Better World" by the Danish filmmaker Susanne Bier, takes a look at the lives of two families in small-town Denmark as they become intertwined through an uneasy friendship of two boys. The official Canadian entry to the Oscar also bows in Abu Dhabi. "Incendies", directed by Denis Villeneuve, is based on a play by Canadian-Lebanese writer Wajdi Mouawad, and tells the story of a mother’s cryptic will that forces her grown children to confront the prospect that the father they thought dead is alive, and that they have a brother. From Egypt is "Messages from the Sea" by Daoud Abdel Sayed, which follows the story of Yehya, who returns to Alexandria, the city of his youth following the death of his mother, where he encounters the new face of the ancient, portrayed as a decaying metropolis. "Cirkus Columbia", is also considered an Oscar contender. Directed by Danis Tanovic, who won the Best Foreign Language Oscar with his film "No Man’s Land" in 2002. Cirkus Columbia follows a wealthy ex-pat who comes home to his small village in Yugoslavia in 1991.
Two documentary films, both dealing with current tensions in the Middle East, are highlighting the 2010 Abu Dhabi Film Festival. "", directed by American director Harry Hunkele and produced by American Emmy-award winning producer Arick Wierson, tells the story of the secret closed door negotiations and power-plays that enabled U.S. President Jimmy Carter to forge the historic Camp David Peace Treaty between Israel and Egypt. The film stars Jimmy Carter, former U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, CNN anchorman Wolf Blitzer, and, in a rare on camera appearance, former U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger. "The Oath" is documentary from director Laura Poitras that tells the tale of two men, Abu Jandal and Salim Ahmed Hamdan, whose meeting launched them on juxtaposed paths with Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, 9/11, US military tribunals and the U.S. Supreme Court.
There are two major Hollywood features opening at the Abu Dhabi Film Festival. Making its world premier is "Secretariat", directed by Randall Wallace, starring Diane Lane and John Malkovich is an adopted biopic of the eponymous racehorse Secretariat. Making its Middle East premiere is "Fair Game", starring Naomi Watts and Sean Penn and directed by Doug Liman, the political thriller tells the real life story of Valerie Plame, American CIA agent outed by the Bush Administration in an effort to discredit revelations of falsified evidence in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Celebrity involvement.
The Abu Dhabi Film Festival, known for attracting a bevy if big Hollywood names i.e. Uma Thurman and Adrien Brody attended in 2010
Press.
In October, 2009, the UK Guardian published an article about the origins and intent of the MEIFF. The article noted that although the host country, Abu Dhabi, at present has only a small indigenous film-making industry, the film festival could serve a variety of constructive purposes.

Douglas Dawson

Brigadier-General Sir Douglas Frederick Rawdon Dawson (25 April 1854 – 20 January 1933), GCVO, KCB, CMG, was a British Army general officer.
He was the second son of the Hon. Thomas Vesey Dawson, an officer of the Coldstream Guards who was killed at the Battle of Inkerman. His paternal grandfather was Richard Thomas Dawson, 2nd Baron Cremorne. His older brother, Vesey John Dawson, was also a British Army officer. 
He attended Eton College, and then joined the Coldstream Guards in 1874, attending the Staff College in 1881. He saw service with the Egyptian Campaign of 1882, where he fought at the battles of Mahuta, Kassassin, Tel el-Kebir and the capture of Cairo. In the Nile Expedition of 1884-85, he was part of the Guards' Camel Corps, was mentioned in despatches, and saw action at the Battle of Abu Klea. He was then appointed a Military Attaché from 1895 to 1901, posted to Austria-Hungary, Serbia, France, Belgium and Switzerland, before returning to the United Kingdom as Master of the Ceremonies to King Edward VII from 1903–1907 and then as a Comptroller in the Lord Chamberlain's Department. 
On the outbreak of the First World War he received a War Office appointment as ADPS from 1914 to 1915, and was appointed Inspector of Vulnerable Points at GHQ from 1916 to 1919, in which role he was again mentioned in despatches. After the War, in 1920, he resigned his position as Comptroller and was appointed State Chamberlain, holding the office until 1924.
Partly as a result of his diplomatic career, he held a number of foreign decorations, including the Iron Crown of Austria (Knight Commander); the Turkish Order of Medjidie (3rd class); the Danish Order of Dannebrog (Grand Cross); the Japanese Grand Cross Sacred Treasure and Grand Cross Rising Sun; the Grand Cross of the Crown of Italy; and the Grand Cross of the Crown of Romania.

Eric Michelman

Eric Michelman, a graduate from MIT, is credited with inventing the now commonplace computer input device known as the scroll wheel. Scroll wheels are most often located between the left and right-click buttons on modern computer mice.
History.
In 1993, Michelman began work on his project to ease navigation within Excel. His interest in eased navigability stemmed from real-time observation of users entering data in spreadsheets. 
“…as I was watching many Excel users do their work, I noticed the difficulty they had moving around large spreadsheets. Finding and jumping to different sections was often difficult. I had the idea that perhaps a richer input device would help.” 
Michelman initially looked to add a 'zoom-lever' for the left hand to control while navigating the Microsoft GUI. After experimenting with a joystick assigned to panning (scrolling) as well as zooming, Michelman approached Microsoft's engineers with his idea. In his position as Program Management Lead for the Excel project, he persuaded the hardware engineers to develop added functionality to the current hardware to allow richer input and then evangelized the new functionality to the other Office applications. A debate raged over whether all the Office applications should have the same scrolling or zooming default, with Michelman subsequently conceding to the idea that having them all, including Excel, scroll by default would possess the greatest overall utility. Michelman was charged with organizing the software support for this new function. Being the Program Management Lead for the Excel project, he was well positioned to achieve this, and did.
Advances in Technology.
There have been many advances in computing mice since the dawn of the scroll wheel. 1999 brought the advent of a marketable LED technology optical mouse from Agilent. Close following in the same year, Microsoft released its version of an optical mouse, the Intellimouse Explorer.
Michelman's brainchild has since been elaborated on by the likes of Logitech, Apple, and other major computer peripheral manufacturers. In 2007 Logitech combined all of these technologies and more when the company released a 7-button, 2-wheel, fully customizable mousing device aptly named "MX Revolution." This technology is intended to address a user's need when 
"The typical computer user has six applications open and switches windows every 50 seconds. In a work day, we rack up 26 feet on the mouse's scroll wheel." 
Other Contributors.
A jointly developed mouse by Japanese (NTT) and Swiss (ETH) companies may mark the first appearance of a wheel-function on a mouse back in 1985. They developed what was a thumb wheel for their companies, the (original) "Mighty Mouse." This mouse did not catch any traction in the world computing market.
Additional work by Michelman.
Michelman has an SB degree from MIT, an MS in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, and an MBA from MIT. Before working at Microsoft, he worked at Apple on the Lisa project and co-founded Analytica with Adam Bosworth, hiring Brad Silverberg as their first employee. Michelman has also been prolific in participating in the production of patents pertaining to different ergonomic and navigability properties of computer input implements.

10th Press Camp Headquarters

The 10th Public Affairs Detachment (Press Camp Headquarters) is a U.S. Army tactical, 31-person unit providing a Battalion level headquarters and is composed of Public Affairs and support professionals, commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel and Command Sergeant Major.
The mission of the 10th PAD (PCH) is "on order, to deploy in support of Combatant Commander requirements across the spectrum of current and future operations to conduct Public Affairs operations and implement the information strategies of the supported commander in order to support civilian news media and facilitate news gathering efforts in the theater."
The 10th PAD (PCH) was originally activated in 1966 during the Vietnam War as the 10th Public Information Detachment. The 10th PID served with distinction prior to being inactivated in 1972, earning the Republic of Vietnam’s Cross of Gallantry with Palm three times and the U.S. Army’s Valorous Unit Award. The 10th was redesignated a Public Affairs Detachment in March 2004 and reactivated in October 2005. The unit was later deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and assumed the role of the Multi-National Force Iraq's Coalition Press Information Center (CPIC).
The 10th PAD(PCH)’s home station is Fort Bragg (North Carolina). The 10th is an element of the U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) and is not a permanent element of any division or corps.. The unit has a command cell, a headquarters section and an expeditionary section. Within the expeditionary section are four, five member teams each with an officer, two print journalists and two broadcasters. The 10th may also serve as headquarters for other public affairs units, such as Public Affairs Detachments (PADs) and Broadcast Operations Detachments (BODs). Although subordinate FORSCOM PA units (27th PAD, 49th PAD, 50th PAD and 22d MPAD) are technically attached, all work and deploy autonomously, meeting the demands of today's modular Army.
In 2009, elements of the 10th PAD (PCH) deployed forward in support of Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay. Team GTMO was composed of Soldiers from the 10th Public Affairs Detachment (Press Camp Headquarters) from Fort Bragg; the 22d Mobile Public Affairs Detachment (MPAD) from Fort Bragg; and the 7th MPAD from Fort Hood. They provided Public Affairs Media relations support to Joint Task Force Guantanamo. They returned from the mission in January 2010.
The 10th PAD (PCH) deployed to Iraq again in August 2010, at the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and ushered in Operation New Dawn. They task organized under United States Forces-Iraq (USF-I), Strategic Communications directorate, where they relieved the 318th Public Affairs Operations Center in maintaining a CPIC.
The CPIC has four main functions: 1) credentialing and badging media covering troops and operations; 2) embedding media with units; 3) escorting media interacting with troops; 4) acquiring video and print/photo stories for dissemination to internal audiences (such as troops, DoD civilians and family members) and external audiences (such as the American public through social media and traditional media).
In October 2012, Soldiers of the 10th Press Camp Headquarters deployed to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J. and Fort Hamilton, N.Y., to support local, state and federal authorities responding to relief efforts after Hurricane Sandy swept the East Coast. The 10th PCH, on order, deploys anywhere in the United States to support federal, state and local agencies across the full spectrum of media operations, and during Hurricane Sandy Relief efforts they provided public affairs support, media facilitation and news coverage as part of Hurricane Sandy’s severe weather response force. During the two-week Hurricane Sandy mission, more than thirty-five print, photo and video products were produced by the acquisition teams of the 10th PCH at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, Fort Hamilton and the surrounding local areas.

Moving Day (book)

Moving Day is a young adult book of poetry by Ralph Fletcher, illustrated by Jennifer Emery. It was first published in 2006.
Summary.
Thirty-four short free verse poems that express the feelings of a twelve-year-old boy moving from Massachusetts to Ohio. Some of the topics include packing, the discovery of long-lost treasures, giving things away, and doing things one last time.
Reception.
Kirkus Reviews said "The poet leaves pretension at the moving-van door and gives readers a real feel for the evocative emotions of a regular kid--and that regular kid was Fletcher himself. Emery's accompanying watercolor illustrations are like flashes of family history viewed through hand-swiped frost on windows of memory. They are simple, but they speak volumes. A fine collection." Mary Jean Smith in her review for School Library Journal said that "like shards of glass, Emery's pencil drawings with their watercolor washes mirror the loss and longing in these poems." and she describes the book as "excellent in relation to other titles on the same subject or in the same genre" Sylvia M. Vardell in her book "Poetry People" said that "the poems are loosely connected one to another to reveal the grieving process of separating from the familiar and slowly establishing new roots in a new place." and that "this collection is a reassuring voice for children who are dealing with one of life's most challenging transitions."

Thomas Leavitt (inventor)

Thomas Leavitt (1827–1899) patented, along with his brother Martin Leavitt, the first machine in the U.S. that made machine-cancelled postal letters practicable, enabling the United States Post Office to increase the volume of mail it handled, quickening the pace of delivery and allowing customers to more easily send letters of various sizes.
Biography.
Leavitt, a resident of Malden, Massachusetts, was born in 1827 at Hingham, Massachusetts, the son of Martin Lincoln Leavitt, and began working in the early 1870s on a continuous cancelling machine – one that could mechanically sort and stamp envelopes. The postage stamp itself was a relatively new invention, introduced in the U.S. in 1847, and within a couple of decades the volume of U.S. mail began overwhelming hand cancelling, the only practical method of cancelling each stamp so it could not be reused.
By the early 1870s, inventors in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, had introduced a machine which allowed the cancelling of postal cards of a standardized size, speeding their processing by eliminating the need for hand-cancelling. But a mechanism which would allow letters of various sizes, shapes and thicknesses to pass through a sorter proved a stumbling block.
In 1875 Thomas Leavitt and his brother Martin were issued United States Patent Number 175,290 for a device which would allow different sizes of letters to have their postage stamps cancelled. 
Backing Leavitt financially was Henry E. Waite, who advanced Leavitt money for construction of the initial model. Following the death of Martin Leavitt in 1877, Thomas Leavitt continued to work on the brothers' initial invention, eventually enlisting his cousin Elijah Leavitt Howard to help in his machine shop and perfect the device. Leavitt eventually received five patents for his mechanical sorting devices. Most of Leavitt's subsequent improvements were designed to improve the feeder mechanism for sorting envelopes of various sizes and shapes, as well as pulling each envelope through the rollers for cancelling.
In awarding Leavitt's new machine a gold medal at its 1881 exhibition, the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association noted that Leavitt's subsequent improvements on his original patent had perfected the earlier postal card cancelling machine, "allowing letters of large or small size, either thick or thin, to be operated on to perfection." A number of improvements, including a feeder box, a system of double rollers and a movable impression shaft meant that Leavitt's new invention could be used for all manners of letters, instead of for just a standard-sized card. "The machine works to perfection," the judges noted, "and saves a great deal of labor."
The Leavitt machines, first produced in 1875, saw wide usage in Boston, and subsequently in New York through the end of the 1870s, the 1880s and the 1890s. During the decades following introduction of the revolutionary machine, Leavitt refined the design, garnering new patents and introducing new models. By 1880 Leavitt machines were used in 20 American cities. The cancellations produced by Leavitt machines bore distinctive signatures – sometimes horizontal or diagonal lines, or even football shapes.
By 1882, Leavitt's cousin Elijah Leavitt Howard, formerly a machinist in Leavitt's shop, had made a series of modifications to Leavitt's original design, work which was also financed by Henry Waite. 
Leavitt's initial models "had serious defects which rendered its use impracticable", noted a later U.S. Patent Court decision of 1901. Following Howard's work, the machine was taken to a Boston post office in 1883, where it was used to sort letters for several hours each day, apparently successfully. Howard's improvements on Leavitt's initial machine – including triggers which prevented the deposit of ink on the machine's pressure roll when no envelope was engaged – worked successfully. But Howard's model was shelved and never introduced commercially.
Following the tests, Howard tinkered with his version of Leavitt's cancelling machine to make it quieter and easier to use. But Howard's machine was eventually shelved after its testing. Later, when a competing inventor came up with a modified machine (after having studied prints of Howard's model), the U.S. Patent Courts held the machine did not infringe on Leavitt's initial patent. Because Howard had never introduced his variation, the new model was simply a 'failed experiment'.
The field was opening to a slew of new developers. The next decade brought new competitors to the postal cancelling machine business, with the American Postal Machine Company introducing a line of devices in the 1890s noted for their speed. Soon there were scores of competitors hungry for business from the exploding volumes of United States mail.
Thomas Leavitt, who set off the stampede with his first design, was married to Martha Elizabeth Whittier of Cornville, Maine, in 1851. The inventor died in 1899 and his wife Martha died in 1910. The couple had four children.
