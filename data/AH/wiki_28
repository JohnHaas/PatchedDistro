Drumburgh

Drumburgh is a small settlement in Cumbria, England. It is northwest of the City of Carlisle and is on the course of Hadrian's Wall, near to Burgh by Sands. The village is sited on a gentle hill with a good view in all directions over the surrounding lowlands.
History.
The name means 'Ridge near the fort' as derived from the Celtic language and the common Old English word 'Burgh', pronounced at 'bruff' in this instance. Coggabata is the Roman fort referred to in the placename. The fort was located opposite a ford over the Solway and the site has been both partially overlain by modern housing and additionally it has been damaged by a substantial medieval ditch. the Revd John Leland visited in 1539 that the wall had been heavily robbed to provide for buildings in Drumburgh, such as the castle. The village lies in the old Barony of Burgh, dating from 1092, the baron now being the Earl of Lonsdale. The barony was a bulwark against Scottish invasion across the Solway
Drumburgh Castle.
In the 14th century a pele or tower house known as Drumburgh Castle was built here by Thomas Lord Dacre, whose coat of arms are placed over an entrance at second floor level. Licence to crenellate the preceding tower had been granted in 1307 to Robert le Brun. It passed by marriage in the 15th century to Jacob Harington, but by 1480 it was ruinous. It again needed urgent repairs in 1580 and by 1593 it was simply a fortified farmhouse, occupied by a bailiff, with a datestone over the upper doorway that was inscribed 1518.
In 1646 Cuthbert Orfeur, a tenant of the Earl of Arundel, complained that he had been forcibly removed from the old castle by Lord Dacres agent. In 1678 the Duke of Norfolk sold the building to John Aglionby and by 1696 Sir John Lowther was the owner and during his time alteration works were carried out. After a long period of neglect it was fully restored as a private dwelling in the 1970s. It has extremely thick walls built with stones taken from Hadrian's Wall.
Transport.
Canals.
The Carlisle Navigation Canal (1821–1853) ran in a straight cut from Burgh by Sands to Drumburgh before turning east to avoid Drumbugh Hill and reaching the Solway at Port Carlisle. The Port Carlisle Railway Company filled in the canal and rail passenger services commenced in 1854.
Railways.
Drumburgh railway station was a junction for Port Carlisle on the old branch line to Silloth. It had an island platform and a signal box. A horse-drawn passenger service was provided between Drumburgh and Port Carlisle from 1856, replaced in 1914 by steam propulsion until a steam railmotor 'Flower of Yarrow' was introduced, running until the branch closed in 1932.
Natural history.
The nature reserve of Drumburgh Moss (NGR NY 255 586 ) is a peat bog located immediately south of the village, purchased by the Cumbria Wildlife Trust in 1981; various extensions have been purchased since then. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a National Nature Reserve (NNR), and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC).
Micro-history.
In 1821 Thomas Clark, a blacksmith from Drumburgh, was arrested on a charge of stabbing a labourer on the new canal.

Pinhole occluder

A pinhole occluder is an opaque disk with one or more small holes through it, used by ophthalmologists, orthoptists and optometrists to test visual acuity. The occluder is a simple way to focus light, as in a pinhole camera, temporarily removing the effects of refractive errors such as myopia. Because light passes only through the center of the eye's lens, defects in the shape of the lens (errors of refraction) have no effect while the occluder is used. In this way the ophthalmologist can estimate the maximum improvement in a patient's vision that can be attained by lenses to correct errors of refraction. This can be used to distinguish visual defects caused by refractive error, which improve when the occluder is used, from other problems, which do not. The pinhole occluder can also be used in testing visual acuity in mydriatic patients. In this case the pinhole occluder compensates for the inability to contract the iris assisting the eye in obtaining a retinal projection similar to that of an non-cycloplegic eye.
Squinting works similarly to a pinhole occluder, by blocking light through the outer parts of the eye's lens. An improvised pinhole has a similar but better effect. The same principle has also been applied as an alternative to corrective lenses: a screen of pinholes is mounted on an eyeglass frame and worn as pinhole glasses.

The development of the pinhole occluder goes back to 1940. An article titled Amblyopia ex Anopsia in children by Dr. J Horton Young "A new type of Ventilating Occluder' appeared in The British journal of Ophthalmology June 1940 page 297-301.

Sua Pan

The Sua Pan or Sowa Pan is a large natural topographic depression within the Makgadikgadi region of Botswana. It is located near the village of "Sowa", whose name means salt in the language of the San. The Sua salt pan is one of three large pans within the Makgadikgadi, the other two being Nxai Pan and Nwetwe Pan.
The Sua Pan was first described to the European world by David Livingstone, pursuant to his explorations in this region. Significant archaeological recoveries have been made within the Nwetwe Pan, featuring stone-age tools from peoples who lived in this area when a large year-round lake occupied the Sua and Nwetwe Pans.
Currently, Sua Pan is a seasonal lake; it fills with water during the winter rainy season. Among the more successful wildlife conservation projects in Botswana was the community-initiated Nata Bird Sanctuary in the northeast of this area. It opened in 1993 and was awarded that year the "Tourism for Tomorrow Award" for the Southern Hemisphere. It is supported by members of four nearby villages, who have helped make it a success.
Sua Pan is also the site of a sodium carbonate (soda ash) mining operation.
One of the tributaries of the Sua Pan is the Mosetse River. The village of Mosetse is named for it and lies along the river.

The Betrayal (1948 film)

The Betrayal (1948) is a race film written, produced, and directed by Oscar Micheaux.
Plot.
Martin Eden is a successful African American farmer in South Dakota. He is in love with Deborah Stewart, but he believes that she is white and that she would not be interested in him. He is unaware that Deborah also loves him. Martin goes to Chicago to seek out a wife. After an unsuccessful date with a cabaret singer, he reconnects with an ex-girlfriend who introduces him to Linda. They fall in love and marry, and then return to Martin’s farm. The couple become parents, but their happiness is short-lived when Linda’s pathologically jealous father convinces her that Martin is homicidal. She flees the farm with their child and returns to Chicago. Martin tracks her down in the city, but Martin is shot by Linda during a fight. In South Dakota, Deborah discovers she is African American. She travels to Chicago and meets Linda, who agrees to divorce Martin so he can marry Deborah. Linda also gives her child to Deborah to raise. Martin and Deborah return to South Dakota and Linda kills her father in revenge for his role in destroying her marriage.
Production.
"The Betrayal" was adapted by Micheaux from his 1943 novel "The Wind From Nowhere", although the plot regarding racial identities in rural South Dakota was borrowed from "The Homesteader" (1919), Micheaux’ first film. "The Betrayal" marked Micheaux’ return to filmmaking after an eight-year absence following the 1940 release of "The Notorious Elinor Lee".
Micheaux shot "The Betrayal" at a studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey, with location filming in Chicago.
Micheaux named his male lead Martin Eden in honor of the eponymous hero of the Jack London novel. Leroy Collins, a nonprofessional actor, was cast in the role when he came to the Chicago set seeking work as a stagehand and was spotted by one of Micheaux’ assistants. This was Collins’ first and only film appearance.
"The Betrayal" was self-financed by Micheaux. and the director’s cut ran 195 minutes. Twelve minutes were cut for the film’s commercial release.
Release.
"The Betrayal" was the first race film to have its premiere in a Broadway venue in New York City, with reserved seat screenings at the Mansfield Theatre. Reviews of the film were overwhelmingly negative, with "The New York Times" complaining of “sporadically poor photography and consistently amateurish performances” within a story that “contemplates at considerable length the relations between Negroes and whites as members of the community as well as partners in marriage.” "Box Office" also panned the film, noting “sincerity of purpose is perhaps the only redeeming feature of this all-Negro feature.” The African American media was also hostile, with the "Chicago Defender" criticizing the film as "a preposterous, tasteless bore.”
Preservation status.
"The Betrayal" was the last film directed by Micheaux, who died in 1951. No print of "The Betrayal" is known to exist, and it is considered a lost film, although the script can be found in the New York State Archives (Motion Picture Scripts Collection) in Albany, New York.

Fort Desaix

Fort Desaix is a Vauban fort and one of four forts that protect Fort-de-France, the capital of Martinique. The fort was built from 1768 to 1772 and sits on a hill, Morne Garnier, overlooking what was then Fort Royal. Fort Desaix was built in response to the successful British attack on Fort Royal in 1762 and was intended to prevent any future attacker from using Morne Garnier to site cannon that could then bombard Fort Royal from above.
History.
The fort took the name Fort Bourbon in 1793, Fort la Convention in 1793, Fort George during the British occupations (1793-1802, 1809-1814), and became Fort Desaix in 1802. Napoleon Bonaparte renamed the fort to honor General Louis Desaix (1768-1800). The original fort in the area is Fort Saint Louis, which is located at Fort-de-France, and which is still home to a French naval base. Two other forts were added in the 19th Century, Fort Tartenson and Fort Gerbault. 
The British captured Fort Desaix twice, first in 1794 and again in 1809.
On 1 June 1769, an engineer by the name of Le Bœuf proposed the construction of a lunette in front of then Fort Bourbon. Construction was completed in 1780. A 300 meters long subterranean gallery linked the lunette to the main body of the Fort. The lunette was named after the then Governor General of Martinique, the Marquis de Bouillé. During the British attack in March 1794, the lunette resisted for 14 days, after holding off numerous assaults and suffering extensive bombardment. Fort Bourbon surrendered on 22 March, two days after the British captured Fort Royal. 
At the time of the British attack on Martinique in 1809, the fort had an irregular pentagonal shape as it followed the terrain. The British besieged Fort Desaix from 10 to 19 February as they emplaced their 14 cannon and 28 mortars and howitzers. They then commenced an unrelenting bombardment that lasted until the French capitulated on 24 February after the British fire had dismounted most of their guns (some 98) and exploded a powder magazine. The French had had some 113 cannon and mortars, and some 1500 to 2200 men at the start of the siege. Their resistance had cost the French over 200 casualties from the bombardment alone. Fort Royal had already surrendered on the 10th, so with the fall of Fort Desaix, all resistance on Martinique ceased. After the battle the British substantially demolished the fort. 
A Court of Inquiry in Paris in December 1809 stripped Admiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, the Governor General of Martinique, and some of his subordinates of their rank and honors, holding them responsible for problems with the fortification of Fort Desaix and the loss of the island.
The Fort returned to French control in 1814, in a severely reduced state. In 1848 it was restored, but was of limited defensive importance. It was refitted in 1880 and 1905 to house a battery of coastal artillery. 
Between 1940 and 1943, while under the administration of the Vichy High Commissioner in the Antilles, Admiral George Robert, the fort housed 286 tons of the Bank of France's gold reserves, delivered by the cruiser "Émile Bertin". The gold reserve had originally been destined for Canada.
Today.
Today, Fort Desaix is the headquarters for the French armed forces in the Antilles and the 33rd Regiment of Marine Infantry, which consists of five companies, two of which are actual line companies.

Richard Van Allan

Richard Van Allan CBE (28 May 1935 – 4 December 2008) was a versatile British operatic bass singer who had a lengthy career.
He sang varied repertoire at Covent Garden and English National Opera, as well as at numerous important houses worldwide. With his distinctive profile and memorable stage presence, he made a powerful impression in many roles, from Wagner, Verdi and Mozart, to Gilbert and Sullivan. "The Times" wrote that he embodied "all the virtues that make the complete artist — vocal beauty and technique, musicianship, language, dramatic ability, stylistic authority".
Biography.
Richard Van Allan was born in Clipstone, Nottinghamshire, on 28 May 1935. He grew up in Derbyshire, singing in the church choir in Bolsover and participated in Gilbert and Sullivan operas at Brunts grammar school in Mansfield. He left school without finishing, becoming a police cadet, and became a constable after completing military service in Germany, where he became more interested in singing. He studied at Worcester Teacher Training College, during which he sang in concerts and performed in more amateur Gilbert and Sullivan productions.
Career.
Van Allan taught science in Birmingham while studying voice with David Franklin at the Birmingham School of Music. In 1964, he joined the chorus of Glyndebourne Festival Opera, then Sadler's Wells. He also toured with Opera for All. Van Allan made his solo debut at Glyndebourne in 1966 as Second Priest and Second Armoured Man in Mozart's "The Magic Flute". In 1967, he appeared as Osmano in Francesco Cavalli's "L'Ormindo" at Glyndebourne under Raymond Leppard. He sang the roles of the Speaker in "The Magic Flute", Johann in Massenet's "Werther", and in 1969 he alternated in the title role and as Leporello in "Don Giovanni" for Sadler's Wells at the London Colliseum. In 1970 he created the role of Colonel Lord Francis Jowler in the premiere of Nicholas Maw’s "The Rising of the Moon" at Glyndebourne.
He made his 1971 Covent Garden debut as the Mandarin in Puccini's "Turandot".

He also sang with Welsh National Opera, beginning in 1969, in the leading bass roles in "La Cenerentola", "Rigoletto", "Macbeth", "Nabucco", "The Barber of Seville", "Aida" and "Ernani".
Van Allan returned to Sadler's Wells in the title role of "Don Giovanni", in John Gielgud's production. He later sang Leporello with English National Opera (Sadler's Wells's new name), as well as the Grand Inquisitor and later King Philip II in "Don Carlos" (Verdi), the title role in "Boris Godunov" (Mussorgsky), Baron Ochs in "Der Rosenkavalier" (Richard Strauss), the title role in "Don Quichotte" (Massenet), Count Almavivia in "The Marriage of Figaro" (Mozart), Procida in "I Vespri Siciliani" (Verdi), Mazeppa (Tchaikovsky), Padre Guardiano in "La forza del destino" (Verdi), Mephistofeles in both Gounod's and Berlioz's versions of "Faust", Mustafà (Rossini), and one of his most admired parts, Claggart in Benjamin Britten's "Billy Budd", among many other roles. He was the original Pooh Bah in ENO's acclaimed version of "The Mikado", one of his favourite parts at ENO.
Overseas, he appeared at the Opéra National de Paris and elsewhere in France, La Monnaie in Brussels, the Wexford Festival in Ireland, Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, San Diego Opera (where he sang his first Baron Ochs in "Der Rosenkavalier" in 1976), the Metropolitan Opera (where he finally made his debut in 1987 as Count des Grieux in Massenet's "Manon"), Boston, Miami and Seattle.
His concert performances included Beethoven's Ninth symphony, Bruckner's Mass in F minor, Dvořák's "Te Deum", and Berlioz's "L'enfance du Christ" and "The Damnation of Faust" (with Sir Simon Rattle). From 1986 to 2001 Van Allan was director of the National Opera Studio (succeeding Michael Langdon). He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2001.
Later years.
In his later career, his performances became less frequent. However, he continued to tackle new roles. He created the role of Tiresias in the world premiere of John Buller's "The Bacchae" (1992) with English National Opera. Also in 1992, he sang the role of Davenant in "", a television miniseries based on Heinrich Marschner's opera "Der Vampyr". In 1994 at the English National Opera, he sang the title role in Massenet's "Don Quichotte" for the first time. Also at ENO, he sang the Man Without a Conscience in Nigel Osborne's Goya opera "Terrible Mouth", and King Hildebrand in Ken Russell's much criticised production of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Princess Ida". He performed in Madrid as Don Jerome in the first staged performances of Robert Gerhard’s "The Duenna", and in Florence as Swallow in "Peter Grimes". At Glyndebourne, he played the comic speaking role of Frosch in "Die Fledermaus" in the autumn of 2006. His last performance was as Folz in Wagner's "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg" at the 2006 Edinburgh Festival.

3rd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment

The 3rd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment (3–69 AR) is a United States Army combined arms battalion and part of the Third Infantry Division based at Fort Stewart, Georgia. 3–69 AR was the first conventional US unit to enter Iraq in 2003, and among the first units to serve four tours in Iraq. Throughout Operation Iraqi Freedom 3–69 AR was featured several times on CNN, ABC News, and the PBS documentary "Back to the Front" detailing the deployment of Sgt Michael Murphy. The unit was first made famous for taking the Baghdad International Airport in 2003.
WWII.
3rd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, was originally constituted on 15 July 1940 in the Regular Army as Company C, 69th Armored Regiment, an element of the 1st Armored Division. It activated on 31 July 1940 at Fort Knox, KY, and inactivated there on 10 January 1942.
It reactivated on 15 February 1942 at Fort Knox, KY, ( the 69th Armored Regiment was concurrently relieved from assignment to the 1st Armored Division and assigned to the 6th Armored Division). It was reorganized and re-designated on 20 September 1943 as Company C, 69th Tank Battalion. It was eventually absorbed on 10 July 1945 by the 69th Amphibian Tractor Battalion (the 69th Amphibian Tractor Battalion was concurrently relieved from assignment to the 6th Armored Division). It inactivated on 8 March 1946 at Camp Kilmer, NJ.
Cold War.
The former Company C, 69th Tank Battalion, was reconstituted on 21 August 1950 in the Regular Army as Company C, 69th Medium Tank Battalion, an element of the 6th Armored Division. It activated on 5 September 1950 at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. It inactivated there on 16 March 1956.
It was re-designated on 14 January 1957 as Company C, 69th Tank Battalion (the 69th Medium Tank Battalion was relieved on 1 February 1957 from assignment to the 6th Armored Division), and on 15 February 1957 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3rd Medium Tank Battalion, 69th Armor. It was concurrently reassigned to the 25th Infantry Division, and activated to Hawaii (its organic elements concurrently constituted and activated). It inactivated on 1 July 1963 in Hawaii and relieved from assignment to the 25th Infantry Division.
Re-designated on 15 August 1983 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 3d Battalion, 69th Armor, the unit was assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division, and activated in Germany. It inactivated on 16 April 1986 in Germany and was relieved from its assignment in the 3rd Infantry Division.
The unit was reassigned on 16 October 1987 to the 24th Infantry Division and activated at Fort Stewart, Georgia. With the inactivation of the 24th ID, and the activation of the 3rd ID at Fort Stewart, the unit was reassigned once more, becoming part of the 3rd Infantry Division, based still at Fort Stewart, Georgia.
1990s.
Throughout the 1990s, the battalion deployed in support of numerous war-time missions including Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in Iraq, Intrinsic Action in Kuwait and Kosovo Force Operation support in Kosovo.
Global War on Terrorism service.
In March 2003 the battalion, under the command of LTC Ernest P. "Rock" Marcone, deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom I, where it served as the "Point of the Spear" for the 3rd Infantry Division, participating in many 1BCT battles, to include the seizure of Baghdad International Airport.
In January 2005, the Speed and Power Battalion deployed again under the command of LTC Mark Wald in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III. The battalion was based primarily at FOB Brassfield-Mora, Patrol Base Uvanni, and Patrol Base Olsen. This time the battalion served as the 1st Brigade Combat Team's and 42nd Infantry Division's main effort in Samarra, Iraq. After a successful tour, Task Force 3–69 AR redeployed to Fort Stewart in January 2006.
In January 2007, 3rd Battalion 69th Armor Regiment deployed with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division to Operation Iraqi Freedom V. The battalion was initially tasked with securing the volatile city of Ramadi, appropriately dubbed by intelligence personnel as the "most dangerous city in the world." Additionally, the unit was tasked with forming ties with local Sunni Sheiks, including the martyred Sheik Abdul Sattar Abu Risha. The battalion continued its second half of the deployment north of Ramadi, and executed numerous expeditionary combat operations near Lake Thar Thar, Habbaniyah, and the southern region of the Salah ad Din Province. This fifteen month deployment was part of the General Petraeus "surge" of force. After a successful tour, Task Force 3–69 Armor redeployed to Fort Stewart, Georgia in March 2008, to train in preparation of future operations.
Most recently, Soldiers from Task Force 3–69 deployed in December 2009 in support of OIF VII to northeast Baghdad as the main effort of the 1st Heavy Brigade Combat Team-Augmented. The battalion assumed responsibility for an area of operations once belonging to two battalions and a brigade headquarters. The mission of enabling security and protecting the people of Iraq was accomplished through advising and assisting the Iraqi Security Forces as well as transitioning the overall responsibility for the security of Iraq from US forces to the Iraqi government. Following a successful transition into Operation New Dawn, Task Force 3–69 redeployed in December 2010 and is currently preparing for follow on missions.
Notoriety.
Bradley Fighting Vehicles attached to 3–69 AR were the first regular army elements to cross the berm into Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom I. The battalion was tasked with taking the Baghdad International Airport. When the campaign started, 3/69 AR led the rest of 3ID on the drive to Baghdad. After helping destroy the Iraqi 11th Infantry Division at Nasiriyah, 3ID turned north-west, covering unprecedented distance rapidly. It was temporarily stopped south of the Karbala Gap due to intense sandstorms and a need to wait for logistical support. Once the weather improved, the division resumed its advance, clearing the gap and turning north-east towards Baghdad.

Nata River

The Nata River or Manzamnyama River is a natural watercourse in Southern Africa. It is an ephemeral river flowing in Zimbabwe and Botswana. It has a length of 330 km from its source to mouth, 210 km in Zimbabwe and 120 km in Botswana. Its total catchment area is 24,585 km2. The river originates in Sandown (S20.425036˚, E28.180660˚), a small farming town located on the Zimbabwean central watershed 50km south west of Bulawayo and ends in the Makgadikgadi Pans (S20.348816˚, E26.240166˚) in Botswana. There is no outlet from the salt pans which can be considered as the “dead sea” of the south. The upper reaches of the river are located in a commercial farming area where good environmental and farming practices have resulted in the river experiencing very little siltation/sedimentation. Impressive sedimentation starts occurring about 65 km along the river course marking the beginning of a 90 km stretch in Zimbabwe where the river passes through communal farming areas. It is on this stretch where the sand-abstraction potential of the river is realised and communities rely on the sand river water for domestic, farming and livestock purposes. Within the country of Botswana the Nata River is a source of water to the ephemeral wetlands of the Makgadikgadi Pans, where a number of species of limited distribution thrive. Specifically the Nata River discharges to Sua Pan, draining parts of eastern Botswana and southwestern Zimbabwe.

Jewel Carmen

Jewel Carmen (July 13, 1897 – March 4, 1984) was an American silent film actress.
Early life and career.
Born Florence Lavina Quick in Danville, Kentucky, Carmen made her film debut in the 1912 film "The Will of Destiny". She went on to appear in "Daphne and the Pirate" (1916), opposite Lillian Gish and D. W. Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916).
Lawsuits against Fox.
In 1917, Carmen contracted with Fox Film Corporation, but finding the deal unsatisfactory opened a new contract with the Keeney Corporation in 1918 while her first contract remained in effect. Fox sent Keeney notice of their prior contract, warning that they would hold Keeney responsible for assisting her in breaking it, promising to indemnify Keeney against legal retaliation. Carmen launched two lawsuits against Fox, one to attempt to free herself of the obligation of living up to her contract and another to seek redress for their interference with her contract with Keeney.
Key to the issues was the question of where the contracts had been made: New York or California. Fox's offices were located in New York; Carmen was a resident of California. By California law, Carmen was an adult at the time of signing the contract; by New York law, which granted majority at 21, she was not. If not an adult, she could not be legally held to the document she had signed. Though Carmen initially won the first lawsuit, having the contracts set aside and receiving damages of $43,500 from Fox, the decision was overturned on appeal because she had "unclean" hands, having herself treated Fox unfairly. However, she won her second case because Fox's interference with her employment with Keeney had been outside the law, though Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo made clear that he did not approve of the legal loophole that allowed Carmen to break her contract with Fox.
Later years and death.
Carmen later became known for her connection to the scandal surrounding the death of actress Thelma Todd. She was the wife of Roland West, who had an extramarital affair with Todd and who came under suspicion following Todd's death of carbon monoxide poisoning.
Todd died in a garage attached to the home where Carmen's parents lived, which Carmen had formerly shared with West. The death was suspicious for a number of factors, including that Todd was allegedly spotted or spoken to several times the day after her purported time of death; Carmen herself testified before the grand jury that she had seen Todd somewhere with another man. After the scandal broke, Carmen's marriage to West ended, and she retired from the public eye.
Carmen died of lymphoma on March 4, 1984 at the age of 86.

Wireball

Wireball is a street game related to baseball, usually formed as a pick-up game, in urban areas of the United States. The equipment consists of a pimple or, pensie pinkie ball and a convenient place in a street or driveway where an electric power line or group of power lines bisect horizontally. The rules come from baseball and are modified to fit the situation. It can be played with one or more persons per team.
Rules.
Opponents stand facing each other on opposite sides of the wire. Limits of play are defined by agreement, usually the width of the street and landmark in the street such as a manhole cover as the furthest limit of the field. The object of the game is for the “batter” to throw the ball over or hit the wire to get a hit. The fielder must catch the ball before it bounces to make an out. Hits are scored accordingly- a ball thrown successfully over the wire and uncaught is a single. A ball that touches the wire and continues over it is a double. A ball that hits the wire squarely and drops straight down is a home run. If the fielder touches but does not catch a home run ball, it is a triple. If the batter throws the ball under the wire it is a strike. As in baseball, foul balls count as strikes for the first two, but you cannot foul-out. The rules vary from neighborhood to neighborhood.
Tips.
The ball is thrown hard and high above the wires. The closer the batter can get to a vertical trajectory the better. It is not unusual for the batter to stand almost directly below the wire.
The game is more fun and easier if a group of wires is used (two or three).

Telephone numbers in Kazakhstan

Telephone numbers in Kazakhstan are under a unified numbering plan with Russia with the country calling code +7. Historically, +7 was used as the Soviet Union country calling code. Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, all former republics except Russia and Kazakhstan switched to new country codes.
As in Russia, Kazakhstan employs a four-level (local, zone, country, international) open dialing plan. A national number consists of ten digits:
The international dialing prefix is "8~10" - callers dial '8', wait for a tone, and then dial '10', followed by the country code, area code and number. The long distance dialing prefix is "8" - callers dial '8', wait for a tone, and then dial the area code and number.
Under an agreement with Russia on 11 June 2006, Kazakhstan is assigned zoe codes 6xx and 7xx (x = 0 to 9) under the unified plan. Land lines are in geographic zone codes from 710 to 729, mobiles are in zone codes 70x and 77x, and other services are in 75x and 76x. Previously, land lines used zone codes in the 3xx range. As zone codes 3xx are assigned to Russia, zone codes 3xx in Kazakhstan were changed by substituting the leading '3' with '7'.

The Knickerbocker Group was a collection of three men, Washington Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, and William Cullen Bryant, who were American pioneers in the literary fields of general literature, novels, and poetry and journalism, respectively. Other talented poets, playwrights, writers, novelists, journalists, and editors joined this writer's club, dubbed the "Knickerbocker Group" after Irving's "Knickerbocker's History of New York" and pen-name, "Diedrich Knickerbocker".
In addition to Irving, members of this group included James Kirke Paulding, Fitz-Greene Halleck, Joseph Rodman Drake, Robert Charles Sands, Lydia Maria Child, Gulian Crommelin Verplanck, and Nathaniel Parker Willis. Many were frequent contributors to the literary magazine the "The Knickerbocker", under editors Charles Fenno Hoffman and Lewis Gaylord Clark.

Blood plasma fractionation

Blood plasma fractionation refers to the general processes of separating the various components of blood plasma, which in turn is a component of blood obtained through blood fractionation.
Blood plasma.
Blood plasma is the liquid component of whole blood, and makes up approximately 55% of the total blood volume. It is composed primarily of water with small amounts of minerals, salts, ions, nutrients, and proteins in solution. In whole blood, red blood cells, leukocytes, and platelets are suspended within the plasma.
Plasma proteins.
Plasma contains a large variety of proteins including albumin, immunoglobulins, and clotting proteins such as fibrinogen. Albumin constitutes about 60% of the total protein in plasma and is present at concentrations between 35 and 55 mg/mL. It is the main contributor to osmotic pressure of the blood and it functions as a carrier molecule for molecules with low water solubility such as lipid soluble hormones, enzymes, fatty acids, metal ions, and pharmaceutical compounds. Albumin is structurally stable due to its seventeen disulfide bonds and unique in that it has the highest water solubility and the lowest isoelectric point (pI) of the plasma proteins. Due to the structural integrity of albumin it remains stable under conditions where most other proteins denature.
Plasma proteins for clinical use.
Many of the proteins in plasma have important therapeutic uses. Albumin is commonly used to replenish and maintain blood volume after traumatic injury, during surgery, and during plasma exchange. Since albumin is the most abundant protein in the plasma its use may be the most well known, but many other proteins, although present in low concentrations, can have important clinical uses. See table below.
Plasma processing.
When the ultimate goal of plasma processing is a purified plasma component for injection or transfusion, the plasma component must be highly pure. The first practical large-scale method of blood plasma fractionation was developed by Edwin J. Cohn during World War II. It is known as the Cohn process (or Cohn method). This process is also known as cold ethanol fractionation as it involves gradually increasing the concentration of ethanol in the solution at 5oC and 3oC. The Cohn Process exploits differences in properties of the various plasma proteins, specifically, the high solubility and low pI of albumin. As the ethanol concentration is increased in stages from 0% to 40% the is lowered from neutral (pH ~ 7) to about 4.8, which is near the pI of albumin. At each stage certain proteins are precipitated out of the solution and removed. The final precipitate is purified albumin. Several variations to this process exist, including an adapted method by Nitschmann and Kistler that uses less steps, and replaces centrifugation and bulk freezing with filtration and diafiltration. 
Some newer methods of albumin purification add additional purification steps to the Cohn Process and its variations, while others incorporate chromatography, with some methods being purely chromatographic. Chromatographic albumin processing as an alternative to the Cohn Process emerged in the early 1980s, however, it was not widely adopted until later due to the inadequate availability of large scale chromatography equipment. Methods incorporating chromatography generally begin with cryodepleted plasma undergoing buffer exchange via either diafiltration or buffer exchange chromatography, to prepare the plasma for following ion exchange chromatography steps. After ion exchange there are generally further chromatographic purification steps and buffer exchange. 
"For further information see chromatography in blood processing."
Plasma for analytical uses.
In addition to the clinical uses of a variety of plasma proteins, plasma has many analytical uses. Plasma contains many biomarkers that can play a role in clinical diagnosis of diseases, and separation of plasma is a necessary step in the expansion of the human plasma proteome.
Plasma in clinical diagnosis.
Plasma contains an abundance of proteins many of which can be used as biomarkers, indicating the presence of certain diseases in an individual. Currently, 2D Electrophoresis is the primary method for discovery and detection of biomarkers in plasma. This involves the separation of plasma proteins on a gel by exploiting differences in their size and pI. Potential disease biomarkers may be present in plasma at very low concentrations, so, plasma samples must undergo preparation procedures for accurate results to be obtained using 2D Electrophoresis. These preparation procedures aim to remove contaminants that may interfere with detection of biomarkers, solubilize the proteins so they are able to undergo 2D Electrophoresis analysis, and prepare plasma with minimal loss of low concentration proteins, but optimal removal of high abundance proteins.
The future of laboratory diagnostics are headed toward lab-on-a-chip technology, which will bring the laboratory to the point-of-care. This involves integration of all of the steps in the analytical process, from the initial removal of plasma from whole blood to the final analytical result, on a small microfluidic device. This is advantageous because it reduces turn around time, allows for the control of variables by automation, and removes the labor intensive and sample wasting steps in current diagnostic processes.
Expansion of the human plasma proteome.
The human plasma proteome may contain thousands of proteins, however, identifying them presents challenges due to the wide range of concentrations present. Some low abundance proteins may be present in picogram (pg/mL) quantities, while high abundance proteins can be present in milligram (mg/mL) quantities. Many efforts to expand the human plasma proteome overcome this difficulty by coupling some type of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) with high efficiency cation exchange chromatography and subsequent tandem mass spectrometry for protein identification.

SV Südwest Ludwigshafen

SV Südwest Ludwigshafen is a German association football club from the city of Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Rhineland-Palatinate. The club was formed on 29 May 1964 out of the merger of the traditional sides "Sportverein 03 Ludwigshafen" and "Phoenix Tura 1882". They currently play in the tier sixth Verbandsliga Südwest.
__TOC__
History.
SV Phönix 03 Ludwigshafen.
"Fußball-Club Phönix Ludwigshafen" was established in July 1904 and played in the Westkreis-Liga of the regional Süddeutschland league in the years leading up to World War I. The war significantly reduced play in many parts of the country and the situation did not improve until after the conflict had concluded. In 1921, "Phönix" beat "1. FC Pforzheim" in a semi-final contest (1:0) before losing 1:2 to "1. FC Nuremberg" in the league final. The club earned another second place result in senior level regional play in 1923 in the Kreisliga Pfalz before entering the new Bezirksliga Rhein, where it continued to archive good results. From 1927, it was part of the Bezirksliga Rheinhessen-Saar and remained a top-of-the-table side.
Following the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich in 1933, "FC" became part of the Gauliga Südwest, one of 16 new regional top-flight divisions. They captured the title there in 1935 and took part in qualification play for the national championship. The following season they crashed to a 10th place finish and were relegated.
In 1936, "Phönix" was joined with a group of other local clubs ("FC Pfalz Ludwigshafen", "Stemm- und Ringclub Ludwigshafen", "Turn- und Fechtclub Ludwigshafen", "Turnverein 1861 Ludwigshafen", and "Kanu-Club Ludwigshafen") to play as "Turn- und Sport-Gemeinschaft 1861 Ludwigshafen".
"TSG" won its way into the Gauliga in 1938, but as World War II made conditions more difficult, play became more local in character and the team played in the Gauliga Südwest/Saarpfalz (1939–41) and the Gauliga Westmark (1941–43). The following season, "TSG" became part of the wartime side "Kriegsspielgemainshaft Ludwigshafen" alongside "TSG Oppau" and "Verein für Leibesübungen Friesenheim", completing one more campaign before the division collapsed as war overtook the area.
The club was re-established following the conflict as "Sportverein Phönix 1903 Ludwigshafen" and played in the first division Oberliga Südwest from 1945 until 1962 as a mid-table side. They won the 2. Liga-Südwest in 1963, the same year that the new first division Bundesliga was formed. Their title earned the club a place in the new Regionalliga Südwest (II) where they played a single season before the merger that formed the current day club.
Tura 1882 Ludwigshafen.
The "Tura 1882 Ludwigshafen" was itself the result of a merger. His predecessors were the Ludwigshafen FG 03, as the FC Palatinate 1909 who belonged to the Kreisliga West from 1914. After the formation of the Bezirksliga Rhein, the "FG" played three seasons in this league before entering the Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar in 1927. A fourth place in 1928 was its best result there.
The club, now as "Tura Ludwigshafen", won promotion to the Gauliga in 1941, belonging to this league until the end of the war. 
In 1950, the club returned to first division football, earning promotion to the Oberliga Südwest and remained a mid-table side in this league until 1963, with the exception of 1956–57.
Südwest Ludwigshafen.
The new club continued to play in the Regionalliga Südwest after the merger in 1964 but remained an undestinctive side. Only in 1970 and 1971 did it come close to taking part in the Promotion round to the Fussball-Bundesliga when it earned third place finishes. In 1974, when the Regionalligas were disbanded in favour of the new 2nd Bundesligas, "Südwests" eleventh place finish meant it did not qualify for the new league. Instead, it had to enter the tier-three Amateurliga Südwest. In 1978, when the new Oberliga Südwest (III) replaced the three Amateurligas in the region, the club qualified for the league. The club pulled off a surprise in the 1978–79 edition of the German Cup when it defeated the 1. FC Kaiserslautern 2–1 in the third round.
It initially earned good results, finishing second in 1981 but then declined. From 1988, it had another good spell and finished runners-up once more in 1992. In 1994, when the Regionalliga West/Südwest was formed, "Südwest" did not qualify and two years later was relegated to the Verbandsliga Südwest (V) instead. After five seasons there, the club suffered another relegation in 2001 but recovered immediately and returned to the Verbandsliga where it still plays as of 2013–14.

Rugby union in Victoria

Rugby union in Victoria describes the sport of rugby union being played and watched in the state of Victoria in Australia. The code was first introduced some time between the 1850s and 1880s but failed to gain popular following and has had a potted history.
Official Australian Bureau of Statistics report of 2007 on sports participation, Victoria has a very low participation in rugby union (less than 1%). The game is played by a small number of amateur senior clubs and in some private schools in Melbourne.
However, international rugby matches are popular with spectators in Victoria. This is evidenced by the large crowds which attended matches at the 2003 Rugby World Cup, 2006 Commonwealth Games and overall television ratings for blockbuster internationals.
Victoria are represented in the professional Super Rugby competition by the Melbourne Rebels.
History.
Writer Sean Fagan claims that Rugby football was first played in Victoria in the late 1840s and into the 1850s. However, dissatisfaction with how the game was played led to the Melbourne FC in May 1859 adopting its own revised laws of football which was later to become known as Australian rules football.
Club rugby was formally organized in Victoria when the Melbourne Rugby Union (MRU) formed in 1888. Some of the 1888-1889 New Zealand Native football team matches were played in Victoria and England also sent a touring team which both switched between rugby and Victorian rules (Australian rules football).
Victoria first played rugby football against New South Wales in Melbourne in 1894 and sent its first team to play in Sydney in 1895 but after 1889 the game more or less disappeared in the state except for the match played in Melbourne in 1899 against Great Britain.
A Victorian Rugby Union (VRU) was restored in 1908 as arrangements were being made for a Victorian team to play the first Wallabies in Melbourne just prior to their departure for Great Britain. The next year,1909 saw the first presentation of the Dewar Shield, an award for first grade premiership teams still retained. Competition lapsed on commencement of the First World War and was not revived until 1926 when five League clubs decided to convert to Union and form the current VRU. During the following twelve years, up until the Second World War, Victoria played thirty matches against international and interstate teams and produced thirteen Wallabies. Club and representative competition did not resume again until 1946.
Melbourne was selected as a venue for the 2003 Rugby World Cup including finals. The attendances were significant, with the highlights being 50,647 seeing defeat and 50,647 for versus .
Following the success of the Rugby World Cup, in 2004, the Victorian Rugby Union made a bid for a Super Rugby rugby union franchise. The bid had support from backers including the Victorian Government. However it was rejected by the Australian Rugby Union for a team in Perth which became the Western Force.
Melbourne hosted the 2006 Commonwealth Games, which included a component of Rugby Sevens, of which all of the matches were sold out. Melbourne holds the current record attendance for Rugby Sevens.
The inaugural Australian Rugby Championship started August 2007, including eight teams, one of which based in Melbourne, Victoria. It was rumoured that the New South Wales Rugby Union (NSWRU) gave up a fourth club to enable Victoria to participate in the new national competition. and the Melbourne Rebels were created and played out of Olympic Park Stadium. Despite having one of the larger crowd averages in the competition, they finished their first season with a home crowd average of just 3,305 and the league folded with losses in the millions, with the ARU openly blaming the Victorian franchise's larger costs of operation for the failure. The move was a great setback for the Victorian Rugby Union.
On 5 January 2010, it was announced by the Australian Rugby Union that it had awarded control of the new Melbourne Super Rugby team to the Melbourne Rebels consortium and that Melbourne would join the game's elite when the world's premier provincial competition expanded to 15 teams in 2011. The Melbourne Rebels played their first match of Super Rugby at AAMI Park against the NSW Waratahs on 18 February 2011, losing 43-0. The team only had to wait another week before registering their first victory, claiming a thrilling 25-24 win against the ACT Brumbies at AAMI Park in Round 2.

Green Bay Trail

The Green Bay Trail is a rails with trails built on the former Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad. It runs parallel to the Metra North Line for nearly nine miles between from Wilmette to Highland Park.
Early history.
The Green Bay Trail has historical significance dating back nearly 12,000 years, when it is presumed that wooly mammoths traveled along it for migration during the Ice Age. This migration made it a destination for hunters of the time who also used to trail their prey. Following the Ice Age, the trail has little confirmed history until the 1600s when French explorers Joliet and Marquette used it in their explorations of the Americas. Prior to that it has been assumed that the trail was used by American Indians for hunting and trading. The American Indian tribe that most likely used the trail was the Potawatomi, who may have used it until the early 1900s. In the beginning of the 1800s, when early settlers moved West towards Chicago, the trail served as a mail route between Fort Dearborn, Chicago, Illinois and Fort Howard, Green Bay, Wisconsin. In 1832, the trail became an official post road by an Act of Congress. In 1836, the trail hosted its first stagecoach service between Chicago and Green Bay.
The trail began its modern day service in 1836 when stagecoaches were used to carry passengers from Chicago to Green Bay with intermediate stops. It runs along the track bed of the former Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad, which runs parallel to the Union Pacific (then the Chicago & Northwestern) North Line. The Shore Line was abandoned in 1955; the right-of-way was then leased to the Green Bay Trail Committee for development.
Design and construction.
Most of the rail trail is paved except for one portion between Glencoe and Braeside, which is crushed stone. Running parallel to the Metra North Line, riders can access the train directly from the trail at the following Metra stops: Highland Park, Ravinia, Braeside, Glencoe, Hubbard Woods, Winnetka, Indian Hill, Kenilworth, and Wilmette. The trail is wheel-chair accessible. There is also an elevator at Winnetka Station that allows access to the trail. For the most part the trail follows a designated path except in Kenilworth where it runs along Abbotsford road. In Glencoe, the trail also runs along Old Green Bay Road for less than one mile. The work of local landscape architect Jens Jensen can also be seen at various points throughout the trai.
Amenities.
The trail has parking at every trail head, which is also at every Metra station. It also has picnic areas in Shelton Park in Glencoe and in other community park areas in Winnetka and Kenilworth. Attractively designed benches are strategically placed for resting. In Highland Park, the trail travels through the site of the Ravinia Festival, the oldest outdoor music festival in the U.S.
Supporters.
The Green Bay Trail is currently managed by each respective town that it runs through. However, when the trail opened in the 1960s, it was managed by The Green Bay Trail Committee. Volunteer beautifying projects including flower and vegetable gardens alongside the trail are also popular.

Five Martyrs of Shia Islam

The Five Martyrs () were five "ulama" of Shi'i Islam, living in different spans of history, who were executed by the Sunni regimes. The Shia remember them by the term Five Martyrs, and Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Hussain Najafi wrote a book "Shuhada-e Khamsa kay Halaat-e Zindagi" "Biographies of the Five Martyrs" as a tribute to them.
Shahid Awwal.
Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili (1334–1385) was the First Martyr and the author of "Al-Lum'ah ad-Dimashqiya"(اللمعة "The Damascene Glitter").
He was born in 734 A.H (ca. 1334 ) in Jabal 'Amel and was killed on Thursday the ninth of Jumada al-awwal, 786 A.H. (ca. 1385), according to the fatwa of a Maliki jurisprudent that was endorsed by a Shafi`i jurisprudent.
He was a pupil of the pupils of Allamah Hilli, amongst them Allamah's son, Fakhr al-Muhaqqiqin. Shi'i schools were banned and almost gone in Jabal 'Amel. When Muhammad al-Makki was 16 years old, he ventured to al-Hilla in Iraq where he was certified by Fakhr al-Muhaqqiqin the son of the famous al-Hilli.
By the age 21, he returned to Jabal 'Amel and was already certified to narrate hadiths by many other famous scholars of Shi'a and Sunni doctrines of Najaf, Hebron, Makka, Medina, Quds, Damascus, and Baghdad. He also built good relations with Sultan Ali ibn al-Mu'ayyad (بن المؤيد) of Khorasan.
After one-year imprisonment, he was killed by the sword, then crucified, then stoned, and finally his body was set to fire in Damascus in the days of the Sultan Barquq. Due to the crusaders wars the area was suffering from poverty and ignorance was rampant as the Mamlukes took over and established a despotic rule in the region.
The First Martyr came from a very distinguished family, and the generations that succeeded him preserved this honour. He had three sons who were all 'ulema and jurisprudents, and his wife and daughter were likewise jurisprudents.
Shahid Thani.
Zayn al-Din al-Juba'i al'Amili (1506–1558) was the Second Martyr, and the author of the first Sharh of Shahid Awwal's "Al-Lum'ah ad-Dimashqiya" (The Damascene Glitter) titled as "Ar-Rawda al-Bahiyah fi Sharh al-Lum'ah ad-Dimashqiya" (الروضة البهيّة في شرح اللمعة الدمشقيّة ) (The Beautiful Garden in Interpreting the Damscene Glitter).
He was one of the greatest shi'a scholars. He studied under famous Sunni and Shi'a in Jabal 'Amel, Damascus, Cairo, Jerusalem among many others. He was known and respected by sunnis in Baalabeck for this. He was authorized to teach Muslims in the Nouriyah Islamic school according to the five schools of thought.
He became a Mujtahid at age 33 after his visits to Iraq. Since Ijtihad was forbidden and Shi'ism had a history of persecution in the area, especially that shi'ism was still strong among the people as a result of the not-so-long gone Hamdanid dynasty, some people conspired against him due to petty reasons before being judged in front of the Sultan.
He was a widely travelled man, having visited Egypt, Syria, Hijaz, Tihamah, Baitul Muqaddas, Iraq and Constantinople (Istanbul). Always in pursuit of knowledge, he studied from nearly twelve Sunni Ulama of fiqh. Apart from the proficiency in fiqh, he was well versed in Usool, Philosophy, Irfan, Medicine and Astronomy.
He was a man of piety, known for his austere way of life. His students have recorded in his biography that Shaheed maintained his family by selling the woods cut by himself during the nights, and then sat to teach during the day. While in Ba'lbak, he conducted classes in Fiqh according to five schools, i.e. Ja'fari, Hanafi, Shafei, Maliki and Hambali. His "Sharh al-Lum'ah" is a part of curriculum in almost every Hawza even today. He studied from Muhaqqiq Karaki before the later migrated to Iran.
In Rajab of 965 A.H. (1558), he was beheaded on his way to see the sultan and a shrine was built by some Turkmens on the site as they realised his stature. The person that beheaded him was killed by the Sultan orders.
Shahid Thalith.
Qazi Zia-ud-Din Nurullah Shustari, Amir Sayyid (1549–1610) was the Third Martyr and the author of "Majalis ul Momineen".
He was an eminent jurist and alim of his time. He was born in 956 A.H. at Shushtar, one of the cities of the present Khuzestan province in South of Iran. He was sayyid by lineage and belonged to the Mar'ashi family.
Qazi Nurullah Shustari was the most important Shi'a scholar of the Mughal period.
His father was Sayyid Muhammad Sharif-ud-din and grandfather Sayyid Zia-ud-Din Nurullah. He received his early education at home under the tutlage of his grandfather and his father and other local tutors. In the year 979 AH he went to Mashhad, the holy city in the Khurasan province.
It was during Akbar's period, on 1 Shawwal 992/6 October 1584, Nuru'llah Shustari moved from Mashhad to India., and by another account in 1587.
He was appointed an emissary by Akbar in Kashmir and was instrumental in pacifying a revolt which was in offing and he obtained the first census of the areas of Mughal Empire during Akbar's reign. This earned him great respect and trust of the Mughal emperor. On his return he was appointed as Chief Qazi (Qazi Quzaz), position equivalent of Chief Justice, of the Mughal empire.
Under Jehangir's reign he continued to hold the same high position as in Akbar's time. But his position was now threatened because of Jehangir's more orthodox nature. Other groups which had tried to malign his position during Akbar's reign had once again become powerful and influential. Moreover he had made enemies from his involvement in settling of disputes in Kashmir and Agra. His book Ahqaq-ul-Haq (Justification of the Truth) was brought as an evidence against him. A fatwa was passed declaring him a heretic. Thus Jehangir was made to issue death orders for the Qazi. "The Empire of the Great Mughals" mentions this incidence as 
However, he had both the Sikh guru Arjan and the Shi'i Qadi Nurullah Shushtari executed, which demonstrates how different he was from Akbar. ...
Qazi Nurullah Shustari was flogged to death by Jahangir's order because of his writings and he was seventy years old at this time.
Qazi Nurullah is known since that time as "Shaheed-e-Salis" (also "Shahid al-Thalis") or the Third Martyr.
His tomb, which is at Agra, has been the centre of pilgrimage since the day of his martyrdom. It is also a venue where every year people gather from all over the Indian sub-continent to commemorate the anniversary of his martyrdom.
Shahid Rabay.
Mirza Muhammad Kamil Dehlavi was the Fourth Martyr and the author of "Nuzhat-e-Isna Ashariya" (نزھۃ اثنا عشريۃ). This book was a complete response to Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlavi's Tauhfa Ithna Ashari. It was due to this book that he was poisoned by the Ruler of Indian state of Jhajhar.
Shahid Khamis.
Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muḥammad Bāqir al-Ṣadr (March 1, 1935 – April 9, 1980) was an Iraqi Twelver Shi'a cleric, a philosopher, and ideological founder of Islamic Dawa Party born in al-Kazimiya, Iraq. He is the father-in-law of Muqtada al-Sadr and cousin of both Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr and Imam Musa as-Sadr. His father Haydar al-Sadr was a well-respected high-ranking Shi'a cleric. His lineage goes back to Muhammad, through the seventh Shia Imam, Musa al-Kazim. (See Sadr family for more details.)
His father died in 1937, leaving the family penniless. In 1945 the family moved to the holy city of Najaf, where al-Sadr would spend the rest of his life. Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr completed his religious teachings at religious seminaries under al-Khoei and Muhsin al-Hakim at the age of 25 and began teaching.
While teaching he became a prominent member of the Iraqi Shia community, and was noted for his many writings. His first works were detailed critiques of Marxism that presented early ideas of an alternative Islamic form of government. Perhaps his most important work was "Iqtisaduna", one of the most important works on Islamic economics. This work was a critique of both socialism and capitalism. He was subsequently commissioned by the government of Kuwait to assess how that country's oil wealth could be managed in keeping with Islamic principles. This led to a major work on Islamic banking that still forms the basis for modern Islamic banks.
He also worked with Sayyid Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim in forming an Islamist movement in Iraq. This attracted the attention of the Baath Party, which resulted in numerous imprisonments for the Ayatollah. He was often subjugated to torture during his imprisonments, but continued his work after being released.
In 1977, he was sentenced to life in prison following uprisings in Najaf, but was released two years later due to his immense popularity. Upon his release however, he was put under house arrest. In 1980, after writing in the defense of the Islamic Revolution, Sadr was once again imprisoned, tortured, and executed by the regime of Saddam Hussein. His sister, Amina Sadr bint al-Huda, was also imprisoned, tortured, and executed. It has been alleged that Sadr was killed by having an iron nail hammered into his head and then being set on fire.
During the execution of Saddam Hussein, chants of "Long live Mohammed Baqir Sadr!" were heard being chanted by some of the Shi'a guards. CNN article

Drona Parva

The Drona Parva (), or "the Book of Drona," is the seventh of eighteen books of the Indian Epic Mahabharata. Drona Parva has 8 sub-books and 204 chapters.
Drona Parva describes the appointment of Drona as commander-in-chief of the Kaurava alliance, on the 11th day of the Kurukshetra War, the next four days of battles, and his death on the 15th day of the 18 day war. The parva recites how the war became more brutal with each passing day, how agreed rules of a just war began to be ignored by both sides as loved ones on each side were slain, how the war extended into the night, and how millions of more soldiers and major characters of the story - Abhimanyu, Jayadratha, Satyajit, Ghatotkacha - died during the war.
Structure and chapters.
This "Parva" (book) has 8 sub-parvas (sub-books or little books) and 204 adhyayas (sections, chapters). The following are the sub-parvas:
English translations.
Drona Parva was composed in Sanskrit. Several translations of the book in English are available. Two translations from 19th century, now in public domain, are those by Kisari Mohan Ganguli and Manmatha Nath Dutt. The translations vary with each translator's interpretations.
Clay Sanskrit Library has published a 15 volume set of the Mahabharata which includes a translation of Drona Parva by Vaughan Pilikian.

Depth sounding

Depth sounding refers to the act of measuring depth; it is often referred to simply as sounding. Sounding is finding the depth of a given point in a body of water. Data taken from soundings are used in bathymetry to make maps of the floor of a body of water, and were traditionally shown on nautical charts in fathoms and feet. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the agency responsible for bathymetric data in the United States, still uses fathoms and feet on nautical charts. In other countries, the International System of Units (metres) has become the standard for measuring depth.
Terminology.
"Sounding" derives from the Old English "sund", meaning swimming, water, sea; it is not related to the word sound in the sense of noise or tones.
Traditional terms for soundings are a source for common expressions in the English language, notably "deep six" (a sounding of 6 fathoms). On the Mississippi River in the 1850s, the leadsmen also used old-fashioned words for some of the numbers; for example instead of "two" they would say "twain". Thus when the depth was two fathoms, they would call "by the mark twain!". The American writer Mark Twain, a former river pilot, likely took his pen name from this cry. The term lives on in today's world in echo sounding, the technique of using sonar to measure depth. 
Sounding.
Sounding was originally done by hand with sounding poles or a weighted sounding line when measuring greater depths.
A "sounding line" or "lead line" is a length of thin rope with a plummet, generally of lead, at its end. Regardless of the actual composition of the plummet, it is still called a "lead." Leads were swung, or cast, by a leadsman, usually standing in the chains of a ship, up against the shrouds.
It is easy to measure a length of line or rope as a rough number of fathoms by repeatedly stretching the rope between the two outstretched arms. Water depths have traditionally been measured this way using a weighted sounding line. The word "fathom" can be used as a verb to describe this process. At sea, in order to avoid repeatedly hauling in and measuring the wet line by stretching it out with one's arms, it became traditional to tie marks at intervals along the line. These marks were made of leather, calico, serge and other materials, and so shaped and attached that it was possible to "read" them by eye during the day or by feel at night. The marks were at every second or third fathom, in a traditional order: at 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, 17, and 20 fathoms. The "leadsman" called out the depth as he read it off the line. If the depth was at a mark he would call "by the mark" followed by the number, if the depth was between two marks, he would call "by the deep" followed by the estimated number.
Soundings were also taken to establish position, a navigation function then, rather than for safety alone. Soundings of this type were usually taken using tallow coated leads with a wad of tallow in a concavity at the bottom of the plummet. The tallow would bring up part of the bottom sediment (sand, pebbles, clay, shells, etc.) and allow the ship's officers to better estimate their position by providing information useful for pilotage and anchoring. If the plummet came up clean, it meant the bottom was rock. Nautical charts now provide information about the seabed materials at particular locations.
Sounding lines were widely used in navigation until the development of echo sounding. Ultrasonic depth sounders provide an accurate graphical profile of the depth of the seabed.

Karna Parva

The Karna Parva (), or "the Book of Karna," is the eighth of eighteen books of the Indian Epic Mahabharata. Karna Parva has 96 chapters.
Karna Parva describes the appointment of Karna as the third commander-in-chief of the Kaurava alliance. The parva recites how war begins to tire and frustrate everyone, triggers angry shouting matches between Yudhisthira and Arjuna - brothers who otherwise love each other. This book describes how brutal war leads to horrifying behavior over the 16th and 17th day of the 18 day Kurukshetra War. At the end of the parva, Karna is killed in a fierce battle with Arjuna.
Karna parva includes a treatise by Krishna on if and when is it ever appropriate to lie or volunteer a falsehood. The parva also includes a symbolic dialogue where Karna in distress demands a just process, but he abuses the just process when others are in distress.
Structure and chapters.
This "Parva" (book) has 96 adhyayas (chapters).
The eighth book of the Mahabharata praises Karna's warrior abilities. He defeats four of five Pandava brothers - Yudhisthira, Bhima, Nakula and Sahedeva. However, Karna does not kill any of them in order to keep his promise to Kunti - the biological mother of Pandavas and his - to not harm his four step brothers, but only kill Arjuna (see Udyoga Parva). Yudhisthira becomes upset with Karna's action and behavior on the battlefield, criticizes Arjuna for failing everyone during the war, and particularly by not engaging Karna. This upsets Arjuna who reminds Yudhisthira, in Chapter 70 of Karna parva, that Yudhisthira's addiction to gambling is at the root cause of everything - from their exile to this unnecessary war. Krishna intervenes between the two brothers and reconciles them.
On the second last day of the war, Karna and Arjuna engage in a mortal fight. Karna's chariot sinks into earth. Karna steps out to remove the wheel, asking Arjuna to suspend their battle, as the agreed rules of just war required. However, Krishna tells Arjuna that Karna has no right to the rules of a just war because Karna has consistently violated those rules against Pandava's army during the war, including when he killed Abhimanyu - the son of Arjuna. Arjuna hestitates, asking whether virtue is an absolute or relative concept. Krishna tells Arjuna that if someone's evil is established, the evil doer suspends his right to expect virtue. Karna meanwhile fires an arrow at Arjuna, as he is trying to lift his chariot out of earth. Arjuna responds with a fatal arrow, killing Karna.

Drona Parva was composed in Sanskrit. Several translations of the book in English are available. Two translations from 19th century, now in public domain, are those by Kisari Mohan Ganguli and Manmatha Nath Dutt. The translations vary with each translator's interpretations.

Clear Cut Press

Clear Cut Press is small press located in Portland, Oregon.
About.
Clear Cut Press was founded by novelist Matthew Stadler and Up Records co-founder Rich Jensen in 2002. Jensen began talking to Stadler while taking a poetry class in 1997. Their mutual interest in cultural movements and the role of books lead to a discussion resulting in the press. Stadler realized that he knew about "a dozen writers who weren't reaching the audience the could--or weren't being published at all." Stadler noted that, "as a business and artistic venture, Clear Cut is inspired by early 20th century subscription presses, such as Hours Press and Contact Editions, and by the mid-century paperbacks of New Directions and City Lights." A series was available by subscription. Individual volumes were distributed to the trade.
As part of what Stadler referred to as the cultivation of "a long-term conversation that makes a community of readers (and therefore a market) that isn't reached through the national book review organs or most bookstores," Clear Cut actively participates in events in bookstores, warehouses, summer festivals, art museums, and non-traditional settings. Events included reading The Horse Hospital, MoMA PS1, Beyond Baroque, Bumbershoot, What the Heck Fest, KGB Bar, Space 1026, and Catch that Beat. In 2005, Clear Cut Press along with the Western Front Society sponsored Unassociated Writers Conference and Dance Party in Vancouver, BC, a self-organizing event in response to first Association of Writers & Writing Programs (AWP) Conference to take place outside of the United States.
First Series.
00 The Clear Cut Future
In 2003, Clear Cut released "The Clear Cut Future" the first book in the series. The anthology included writing from the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere in what, according to the catalog, made "a map of the territory of interest to Clear Cut Press." Contributions included work by Stacey Levine, Charles D'Ambrosio, Steve Weiner, Robert Glück, a former Enron executive. The Seattle Times noted, "Tightly written poems and short stories about existential love and loss mingle freely with essays about corporate sharks, architecture, botanical excursions and artists' memoirs." 
One contributor, Patrick Bissell, was a street poet who sold his work on the streets of Seattle. Bissell was the subject of a profile by Jesse Tarbert in The Seattle Times published on May 6, 2003. Thirty eight at the time of the profile, Bissell grew up in Kirkland and began selling his poetry on the street in 1993. Of Bissell's work, "Stadler said "The Sweet Gift" contains some of Bissell's best writing. It reminded him of the work of Emmanuel Bove, a French writer of the early 1920s, he said. In both Bove's and Bissell's work, Stadler said, "the pacing and logic are so at ease, so like the drift of life, and yet it's very literary." 
Other books in the series included:
In addition, Clear Cut Press published a catalog of Portland painter Michael Brophy's work with an essay by Charles d'Ambrosio.
Interim.
The Back Room: An Anthology
In 2007, Clear Cut released an anthology edited by Matthew Stadler collecting work presented at the Back Room series in Portland, Oregon. The book included work by Mary Gaitskill, Lisa Robertson, Gore Vidal, Dodie Bellamy, Wayne Koestenbaum, Kevin Killian, Lawrence Rinder, Michael Hebb, Stephanie Snyder, Moira Roth, John O'Brian, Marc Joseph, Randy Gragg, Barbara Verchot, Anne Focke, and Daniel Duford.
Second Series.
The second series of Clear Cut Press was announced on April 13, 2007 by Rich Jensen and Matthew Stadler. The books selected and edited by Matthew Stadler included work by Emily White, Bruce Benderson, Danielle Dutton, Stacy Doris, Matthijs Bouw. At the event, billed as The Clear Cut Press Potlach, Matthew Stadler announced as a result of being awarded a grant from the UA Artist Trust, he was leaving the press and the country in order to go to Mexico and write.

Showtoons

Showtoons were a trademark of unisex children's underwear that were manufactured by Hanes, established in 1989, and disestablished in 2009. Its competitor, Fruit of the Loom, manufactured the gender-specific "Funpals" (for boys) and "FunGals" (for girls) brands. The reasoning behind the brand segregation is for marketing purposes (for gender identity purposes).
Summary.
Each individual undergarment started out as a pair of either plain white briefs or plain white panties until the desired prints are added in the manufacturing process. Differences found between the male and female undergarments included the fly in the boys' underwear (for easier urination) and the feminine waistband in the girls' underwear (emulating that of women's full cut panties). The softness of the cotton fabric used could have also determined whether the undergarment was to be worn by a male child or a female child when outside of its original packaging box.
Examples of Saturday morning cartoons and movie characters that appeared on a pair of Showtoons underwear included Tinkerbell, Blue's Clues, and the PBS Kids GO! television show Arthur. Characters that were considered to be "retro" and "vintage" on Showtoons underwear (and no longer sold in most retail stores) included The Smurfs, Jonny Quest, and TaleSpin. The word "showtoons" was considered to be a pun on the phrase "show tunes" (which happened to be music played at Broadway musicals) and a portmanteau of the words "show business" and "cartoons." The Showtoons name by itself does not determine whether the product was suitable for boys or girls. Girls' underwear were always packaged as panties; the equivalent for juvenile males were always packaged as briefs. Unlike Funpals which had a large cartoon graphic at the center of the undergarment, Showtoons uses a small but plentiful amount of cartoon graphics throughout the undergarment.
In the Americas, Showtoons were made in either El Salvador or Honduras in manufacturing plants similar to adult underwear.

Farradiyya

Farradiyya (, "al-Farâdhiyyah") was a Palestinian Arab village of 670 located southwest of Safad. 
Farradiyya was situated on the southern slopes of Mount Zabud with an average elevation of above sea level. The Safad-Nazareth highway passed it to the north. Its total land area was 19,747 dunams, of which 25 dunams were built-up areas and 5,365 dunams cultivable.
History.
During the Roman period of rule in Palestine, Farradiyya was known as "Parod". 
Under the Abbasid Caliphate, al-Farradiyya was a part of Jund al-Urdunn ("Province of Jordan"). In 985 CE, Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi describes it as a large village between Acre and Tiberias, with a mosque for Friday sermons. He added that water was plentiful, the surrounding country was pleasant, and there were abundant grapes and vineyards in the village.
Farradiyya was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, after being ruled by Crusaders, Ayyubids, and the Mamluks. By 1596, it was a part of the "nahiya" ("subdistrict") of Jira, part of the "sanjak" ("district") of Safad, paying taxes on wheat, barley, olives, fruits, beehives, goats, and pastures. The village consisted of 43 households.
In the late 19th century, the village was built of stone and the inhabitants grew olives, figs, and tilled small gardens. Springs from Mount al-Jarmaq to the north provided most of the village's water supply, and a boys' elementary school was established during this period.
After the British took over Palestine from the Ottomans in 1917, Farradiyya became a part of the British Mandate of Palestine in 1922. Under the Mandate, it had a thriving agriculture sector, and was known for its model experimental farm which covered 300 dunams of land. The farm was established to improve the variety of apples, apricots, almonds, figs, grapes, pears, and to develop new seed varieties. It had an arboretum where 2,000 plants were grown and distributed to local "fellahin", and the farm provided advice services to teach farmers from the Acre and Safad districts how to raise poultry and beehives. Apart from the farm, there were several water-powered mills in the vicinity of Farradiyya. The village was also the site of a shrine for a local religious leader named Shaykh Mansur. A report from the village (before 1933) noted the maqam for Sheik Mansur as "a square building with arch and niche." The report also noted that there was a medieval arch in the cemetery.
The village was visited in 1933 by a representative from the Department of Antiquities, who reported that "A maqam known locally by the name of "Sheik Mansur" is standing in the main track leading to the village at a point about half way between the village itself and the Govt. School for boys. It is a square room in a ruinous condition about 4m x 4m. The only part which is still to be seen in position is the northern wall -it consists of nine courses above the basement with an average of 27cms height; each course; making a total of 2.45 m high. The N.E. corner as well as the middle of the wall have worn pilasters with 1/2 inch projections. The bases and capitals have simple mouldings. The top most course is made of moulded stones forming a cornice."
1948 War and aftermath.
Farradiyya was captured by Israel's Golani Brigade in Operation Hiram on October 30, 1948. It was not directly assaulted, but as the brigade advanced north from the Arab town of Eilabun in the south towards Sa'sa' in the north, Farradiyya was surrounded by Israeli forces on all sides. 
Prior to its capture, in early May, Arabs from Akbara and az-Zahiriyya took refuge in he village. Because it was not assaulted, many of Farradiyya's residents remained in the village until February 1949. It was on December 15, 1948, that Israeli authorities decided to expel the remaining 261 inhabitants, but the plan was executed in February. Israeli forces evicted most of the villagers to other Arab villages in the Galilee under their control or to the northern West Bank.
In 1949, the Jewish town of Parod was founded on village lands, east of the village site, and in 1950, the town of Shefer was established on Farradiyya's northern lands. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, 
The site is deserted and covered with wild thorns, trees, and piles of stones from the destroyed homes. Cactuses grow on the land around the site, which is mostly utilized for grazing animals.
Demographics.
In 1596, Farradiyya had a population of 237, which over the period of nearly two centuries decreased to about 150 in the late nineteenth century. In a 1922 British Mandate survey, the village had 362 residents, rising to 465 in 1931. In Sami Hadawi's 1945 land and population survey, Farradiyya had a population of 670 Arab inhabitants. The entire population adhered to Islam.

Arar v. Ashcroft

Arar v. Ashcroft, 414 F.Supp.2d 250 (E.D. N.Y. 2006), was a lawsuit brought by Maher Arar against the United States and various U.S. officials pursuant to the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), , and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.
Background.
Maher Arar was a Canadian citizen who was deported to Syria by the U.S. government. In Syria, he was tortured, forced to falsely confess, and released after one year without being charged. 
Arar sought a declaratory judgment that defendants’ conduct violated his "constitutional, civil, and international human rights," as well as compensatory and punitive damages for the statutory and constitutional violations.
Case.
In January 2004, Arar announced that he would be suing then-American Attorney-General John Ashcroft over his treatment. 
The Center for Constitutional Rights brought the suit "Arar v. Ashcroft" against former Attorney General John Ashcroft, FBI Director Robert Mueller, and then-Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge, as well as numerous U.S. immigration officials. It charges the defendants violated Arar's constitutional right to due process; his right to choose a country of removal other than one in which he would be tortured, as guaranteed under the Torture Victims Protection Act; and his rights under international law.
The suit charges that Arar's Fifth Amendment due process rights were violated when he was confined without access to an attorney or the court system, both domestically before being rendered, and while detained by the Syrian government, whose actions were complicit with the U.S. Additionally, the Attorney General and INS officials who carried out his deportation also likely violated his right to due process by recklessly subjecting him to torture at the hands of a foreign government that they had every reason to believe would carry out abusive interrogation.
Further, Arar filed a claim under the Torture Victims Protection Act, adopted by the U.S. Congress in 1992, which allows a victim of torture by an individual of a foreign government to bring suit against that actor in U.S. Court. Arar's claim under the Act against Ashcroft and the INS directors is based upon their complicity in bringing about the torture he suffered. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.
Timeline.
January 22, 2004 – The case was filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. 
January 18, 2005 – The U.S. government moved to dismiss the case by asserting the “state secrets” privilege. The government claimed that the reason Arar was deemed a member of Al Qaeda and sent to Syria, instead of Canada, are “state secrets.” 
February 16, 2006 – Judge David G. Trager issued a memorandum and order dismissing the TVPA, torture, and detention claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Fifth Amendment claim for lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendants. Judge Trager found that national security and foreign policy considerations prevented him from holding the officials liable for carrying out an extraordinary rendition even if such conduct violates our treaty obligations or customary international law.
September 12, 2006 – Arar filed a Notice of Appeal in the Second Circuit.
December 12, 2006 – Attorneys at the Center for Constitutional Rights filed an appeal in the Second Circuit on behalf of Arar.
November 9, 2007 – The appeal was argued before the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
June 30, 2008 – The majority opinion found that adjudicating Arar’s claims would interfere with national security and foreign policy and that as a foreigner who had not been formally admitted to the U.S., Arar had no constitutional due process rights with respect to the government’s interference with his access to a lawyer. This was decided by a three judge panel by a 2-1 vote. The court reversed the district court and ruled Arar had shown a prima facie showing sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over Thompson, Ashcroft, and Mueller, but upheld the dismissal on its merits.
August 12, 2008 – The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit sua sponte issued an order that the case would be reheard en banc. 
December 9, 2008 – En banc hearing was held.
November 2, 2009 - The 2nd Circuit United States Court of Appeals, in a 7-4 decision, upheld the ruling by the district court.
June 14, 2010 - The Supreme Court of the United States denied Arar’s petition for certiorari.

Indian Expressways

An expressway is a controlled-access highway; it is a highway that controls entrances to it and exits from it by incorporating the design of the slip roads for entry and exit into the design of the highway itself. Access-control should not be confused with collection of toll. An expressway may be free to use and may not collect toll at all. Expressways are the highest class of roads in the Indian Road Network. These are six- or eight-lane highways with controlled-access. India has approximately 942 km expressways.
National Highway system of India consists of approximately of four-laned highways that collect toll from users but do not have control of access and cannot be called expressways. Currently, a massive project is underway to expand the highway network and the Government of India plans to add an additional of expressways to the network by the year 2022. These roads will be access-controlled roads and will feature between four and six lanes with km to come up by 2015. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways is already in the process of preparing a draft for creation of a "National Expressways Authority of India" (NEAI) on the lines of NHAI.
Expressways.
Existing.
This list includes roads without access-control. Such a road cannot be called "expressway" though the name of the road may include the word "expressway" and may be a misnomer. Such a road should be excluded from this list. Eastern and Western Express Highways in Mumbai are two examples of such roads. Ambala-Chandigarh NH is another such example as it does not have access control for entry and exit at predetermined points. As stated above, access-control is different from collection of toll.
Planned.
NHAI has proposed the following two Expressways in the NHDP VI.
The Uttar Pradesh government is planning five more expressways in the state. The five proposed expressways will have a combined length of around .
The five expressways would be
Indian National Expressways Network.
India has the third-largest road network in the world spanning 4.69 million km, next in line only to the US and China. However, when it comes to the quality of roads, India lags far behind. Compared to the length of expressways in leading countries, China (84,946 km), the US (75,238 km), Canada (17,000 km), Spain (15,152 km) and Germany (12,800 km), India’s progress in the road sector seems dwarfed at just 1208 km.
On an overall basis also, highways constitute only a 1.7 per cent share at 79,116 km.
Given the importance of expressways, the Government of India had approved the construction of 1,000 km of expressways under the National Highways Development Project (NHDP) Phase VI.
Besides, the ministry came up with a project report to formulate a master plan aiming to construct 15,600 km by 2022, marking the end of the 13th five year plan.
Given the current precarious economic conditions, constructing expressways through the EPC route seems to be the most pragmatic approach. The government can raise long-term debt through bonds or low-cost foreign loans from multi-lateral and bilateral institutions while revenue can be generated by charging tolls from vehicles at entry and exit points.
Also, as witnessed in other countries, state governments should be urged to increase contribution toward these projects, as they will be the key beneficiaries of expressways.
Another way to expedite the process could be that the government could develop the first 50–100 km of the expressway to attract private developers, a model being followed by Jaipur metro.
Once traffic picks up on the expressway, developers could construct the remaining length and be allowed to charge toll on the entire length.
If India needs to achieve the next level in highway development, it has to focus on transit efficiency. For this, the country will have to increase reliance on public funding and shift focus from PPP.
It could also opt for innovative financial models, as suggested above, to make expressway construction a viable business in the country.

Irreligion in India

Atheism and agnosticism have a long history in India. Indian religions like, Buddhism, Jainism and some schools of Hinduism, consider atheism to be acceptable. India has produced some notable atheist politicians and social reformers.
According to the 2012 WIN-Gallup Global Index of Religion and Atheism report, 81% of Indians were religious, 13% were not religious, 3% were convinced atheists, and 3% were unsure or did not respond.
History.
Ancient India.
Schools of Philosophy.
In Hinduism, the religion of majority of Indians, atheism is considered to be a valid path to spirituality, as it can be argued that God can manifest in several forms with "no form" being one of them. But, the path is considered difficult to follow. The belief in a personal creator God is not required in Jainism and Buddhism, both of which also originated in the Indian subcontinent. Atheistic schools are also found in Hinduism.
Hindu philosophy is divided into schools ("darśanam"). These schools can be categorized as "āstika" (orthodox), schools which conforms to the Vedas, and "nāstika" (heterodox), schools reject the Vedas. The six schools, "Sāṃkhya", "Yoga", "Nyāya", "Vaiśeṣika", "Mimāṃsā", and "Vedānta", are considered "āstika" schools. But, "Cārvāka", Jainism and Buddhism are considered "nāstika".
Cārvāka.
The "Cārvāka" school originated in India around the 6th century BCE. It is classified as a "nāstika" school. It is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement in ancient India. Followers of this school only accepted "pratyakşa" (perception) as a valid "pramāna" (evidence). They considered other "pramāna" like "sabda" (testinomy), "upamāna" (analogy), and "anumāna" (inference) as unreliable. Thus, existence of soul ("ātman") and God were rejected, because they could not be proved by perception. They also considered everything to be made of four elements: earth, water, air and fire. Cārvāka pursued elimination of physical pain and enjoyment of life. So, they can be considered hedonistic. All of the original Cārvāka texts are considered lost. A much quoted "sūtra" (Barhaspatya sutras) by Brhaspati, who is considered the founder of the school, is thought to be lost. The "Tattvopaplavasimha" by Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa (8th century CE) and the "Sarvadarśanasaṅ̇graha" by Madhavacarya (14th century) are considered important secondary Cārvāka texts.
Sāṃkhya.
"Sāṃkhya" is an "āstika" school, but has some atheistic elements. Sāṃkhya is a radically dualist philosophy. They believed that the two ontological principles, "puruṣa" (consciousness) and "prakriti" (matter), to be the underlying foundation of the universe. The objective of life is considered the achievement of separation of pure consciousness from matter ("kaivalya"). The reasoning within this system led to "Nir-isvara Sāṃkhya" ("Sāṃkhya" without God) philosophy, which deemed the existence of God unnecessary. There is the opposing reasoning which accepts God, it is called "Sesvara Sankhya" ("Sāṃkhya" with God). "Samkhya Karika" (c. 350 BCE) is the earliest known systematic text of this philosophy.
Mīmāṃsā.
"Mīmāṃsā" (meaning exegesis) is also an "astika" school. They believed the Vedas to be author-less and self-authenticating. They didn't accept the Vedas to be composed by any "ṛṣi" (saint), they considered it to be not authored by anyone ("apauruṣeya"). They accepted the minor deities of the Vedas but resisted any notion of a Supreme Creator. They only concentrated on upholding the "ṛta" (order) by following the duties of the Vedas. The foundational text of this school is the "Mīmāṃsā Sutra" by Jaimini (c. 200 BCE - 200 CE).
Buddhism and Jainism.
Buddhism can be argued to be agnostic as there is no mention of God in it and neither Buddha ever met God. But, godhood can be attained by achieving Nirvana. Mahayana Buddhists may worship several of these Boddhisattvas along with the Buddha. Jainism is based on the completely on the concept of "karma". Jains believe that every soul in its purest form is equal to god, and they can be elevated to godhood.
Philosophers and ancient texts.
Ajita Kesakambali was a materialist philosopher. He is mentioned in the "Samaññaphala Sutta". He rejected gods, afterlife and karma. Payasi is a character, referred to as a prince, who appears in the Buddhist text "Digha Nikaya" in the "Payasi Sutta". He didn't believe in rebirth or karma. He debated Kassapa, a disciple of Buddha and lost, and then converted to Buddhism.
Jabali's speech from the Ramayana.
In the Hindu epic "Ramayana" ("Ayodhya Khanda"), when Bharata goes to the forest to convince Rama to return home, he was accompanied by a sophist called Jabali (""). Jabali uses nihilistic reasoning to convince Rama. He also said that rituals are a waste of food and scriptures were written by smart men so that people would give alms. But, Rama calls him a deviant from the path of "dharma" (""), refuses to accept his ""nastika"" views and blame his own father for taking Jabali into service. He also equates the Buddha to a thief. On hearing Rama's retort, Jabali retracts his statements, saying that he was merely arguing like a nihilist. However, these verses referring to the Buddha are considered a later interpolation, as those verses use a different metre.
The Carvaka incident in the Mahabharata.
A character described as a Carvaka briefly appears in the "Mahabharata" (in the "Shanti Parva"). As Yudhisthira enters the city of Hastinapur, a brahmin, referred to as Carvaka, accuses him of killing his own kinsmen and says that he would suffer for it. The accuser is revealed to a "rakshasa" in disguise, who was a friend of Duryodhana. He had existed since the Krita Yuga virtue of a boon from the god Brahma, that he could only be killed when he is showing contempt towards brahmins. He was promptly killed by other brahmins by the chanting of sacred hymns and Yudhisthira was assured that his actions were the within the kshatriya code. This event may be a possible denigration of the Carvaka philosophy.
Medieval India.
In the 9th century CE, Jain philosopher Jinasena wrote the Mahapurana. The book contains the following often quoted words,
This quote was also featured later in Carl Sagan's book, Cosmos. In the 14th century, philosopher Madhavacarya wrote the "Sarvadarśanasaṅ̇graha" which is a compilation of all Indian philosophies, including "Carvaka" which is described in the first chapter.
Modern India.
19th century.
Between 1882 and 1888, the Madras Secular Society published a magazine called "The Thinker" ("Tattuvavivesini" in Tamil) from Madras. The magazine carried articles written by anonymous writers and republished articles from the journal of the London Secular Society, which the Madras Secular Society considered itself affiliated to.
20th century.
Periyar E. V. Ramasamy (1879–1973) started his Self-respect movement in 1929. He was an atheist and criticised the caste system, religious rituals and superstitions.
Jawaharlal Nehru (1889–1964), India's first Prime Minister was agnostic. His wrote in his autobiography, Toward Freedom (1936), about his views on religion and superstition.
Goparaju Ramachandra Rao (1902-1975), better known by his nickname "Gora", was a social reformer, anti-caste activist and atheist. He and his wife, Saraswathi Gora (1912-2007) who was also an atheist and social reformer, founded the Atheist Centre in 1940. The Atheist Centre is an institute working for social change. Gora expounded his philosophy of positive atheism as a way of life. He later wrote more about positive atheism in his 1972 book, "Positive Atheism". Gora also organized the first World Atheist Conference in 1972. Subsequently, the Atheist Centre has organised several World Atheist Conferences in Vijayawada and other locations.
In 1997, Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations was founded.
21st century.
In 2008, a group of young Indian atheists to set up Nirmukta, an organization dedicated to promoting science, free thought and secular humanism in India. Nirmukta means "freed" or "liberated" in Sanskrit. It was founded as a website, but later became a national organization with regional groups in 8 major Indian cities as of 2012.
In 2009, historian Meera Nanda published a book entitled the "The God Market". It examines how Hindu religiosity is gaining more popularity in the rising middle class, as India is liberalizing the economy and adopting globalization.
In March 2009, in Kerala, a pastoral letter addressing the laity was issued by the Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council urging the members to not vote for political parties who advocate atheism. In July 2010, another similar letter was issued.
On 10 March 2012, Sanal Edamaruku investigated a so-called miracle in Vile Parle, where a Jesus statue had started weeping and concluded that the problem was caused by faulty drainage. Later that day, during a TV discussion with some church members, Edamaruku accused the Catholic Church of miracle-mongering. On 10 April, Angelo Fernandes, President of the Maharashtra Christian Youth Forum, filed a police complaint against Edamaruku under the Indian Penal Code Section 295A. In July while on a tour in Finland, Edamaruku was informed by a friend that his house was visited by the police. Since, the offence is not bailable, Edamaruku stayed in Finland.
On Friday 7 July 2013, the first "Hug an Atheist Day" was organized in India by Nirmukta. The event aimed to spread awareness and reduce the stigma associated with being an atheist.
On 20 August 2013, Narendra Dabholkar, a rationalist and anti-superstition campaigner, was shot dead by two unknown assailants, while he was out on a morning walk.
On 29 October 2013, the Bombay High Court judged in favour of an atheist school teacher from Nashik. Sanjay Salve had been employed by the state-funded Savitribai Phule Secondary School since 1996. In June 2007, during a prayer session, Salve didn't fold his hands during the pledge or prayer. The school management called this indiscipline and refused him a higher pay grade in 2008 when Salve became eligible for it. Salve sought legal recourse citing the Section 28 (a) of the Constitution which states "no person attending any educational institution recognised by the State or receiving aid out of State funds shall be required to take part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such institution or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such institution". The court ruled in Salve's favour and directed the school to release his dues by 31 January 2013.
Legal status, rights and laws.
Atheism and irreligion are not officially recognized in India. Apostasy is allowed under the right to freedom of religion in the Constitution, and the Special Marriage Act, 1954 allows the marriage of people with no religious beliefs, as well as non-religious and non-ritualistic marriages. However, there are no specific laws catering to atheists and they are considered as belonging to the religion of their birth for administrative purposes.
Persecution and attacks.
Narendra Nayak has claimed to have been attacked thrice and twice his scooter has been damaged, one of the attack left him with head injuries. This compelled him to take self-defence lessons and carry a nunchaku. Megh Raj Mitter's house was surrounded a mob, after he debunked the Hindu milk miracle, forcing him to call the police.
On 2 July 2011, the house of U. Kalanathan, secretary of the Kerala Yukthivadi Sangham, was attacked in Vallikunnu after he suggested on television that the temple treasures of Padmanabhaswamy Temple should be used for public welfare. On 20 August 2013, Narendra Dabholkar, a rationalist and anti-superstition campaigner, was assassinated.
Demographics.
Census.
The Indian census does not explicitly count atheists. The Indian census form has a question that asks respondents to disclose their religion and if it fell in the list of six major religions, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Jain, and then write a corresponding code. The Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation had asked enumerators to record "no religion" for the respondents who said so. Yet technically, only the coded answers in the Indian census form were tabulated as classifiable data. As a result, minor or tribal religions as well as atheists and agnostics were placed together in an unclassifiable category of "Others". In the 2001 Census, 0.1% (727,588 people) were reported as "Religion not stated" and 0.6% as "Others", with neither category logically accommodating atheists.
Surveys.
World Values Survey (2006)
According to the 2006 World Values Survey, conducted by the Dentsu Communication Institute Inc, Japan Research Center (2006), 6.6% of Indians stated that they had no religion.
WIN-Gallup Global Index of Religion and Atheism
According to the 2005 Global Index of Religion and Atheism report from WIN-Gallup, 87% of Indians were religious and 4% called themselves atheists. According to the 2012 report by the same organization, 81% of Indians were religious, 13% were not religious, 3% were convinced atheists and 3% were unsure or did not respond.
Worldviews and Opinions of Scientists in India (2007)
In 2007, a survey was conducted by the Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture of the Trinity College with the help of Center for Inquiry (India) called Worldviews and Opinions of Scientists in India. 1100 scientists surveyed from 130 institutes. Most of them identified themselves as secular (59%) or somewhat secular (16%) but refused to be labelled irreligious. 83% defined secularism, as it appears in the Indian constitutions, as the separation of state and religion. But, 93% also defined it as tolerance of other religious philosophies. 20% equated secularism to atheism. Only 11% called themselves completely not spiritual. However, only 8% reportedly said they would refuse to do stem cell research based on religious or moral convictions. Y. S. Rajan commented on this saying that most Indians don't feel there is a conflict between science and religion. Other the hand, Innaiah Narisetti, chairman of Center for Inquiry (India) and Pushpa Bhargava, the former director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, pointed out the lack of scientific temper among Indian scientists.
Rationalism and atheism by region.
Kerala.
There is a sub-group of atheists in Kerala who are members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). There are others who support atheism because of rationalist ideals: these include supporters of the Indian Rationalist Association. The Kerala Yukthivadi Sangham is an organization that supports atheism and rationalism in the Malayali community throughout Kerala. The Yukthivadi was the first atheist/rationalist magazine published in Malayalam.
Some notable atheists from Kerala include Sahodaran Ayyappan, V. S. Achuthanandan, A.K. Antony, Sreeni Pattathanam, Abu Abraham, A. K. Gopalan, Mookencheril Cherian Joseph, Joseph Edamaruku, Sanal Edamaruku and others. Sanal Edamaruku is the founder-president of Rationalist International and the president of the Indian Rationalist Association.

<doc id="20621558" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20621558" title="The Diothas">
The Diothas

The Diothas; or, A Far Look Ahead is a 1883 utopian novel written by John Macnie and published using the pseudonym "Ismar Thiusen". "The Diothas" has been called "perhaps the second most important American nineteenth-century ideal society" after Edward Bellamy's "Looking Backward" (1888).
Synopsis.
The novel begins with a scene in which the first-person narrator undergoes an episode of "mesmerism," or hypnosis, and wakes up in the far future; he has suddenly passed "from the nineteenth to the ninety-sixth century..." In the company of a friend and guide named Utis Estai, the narrator begins to learn the nature of this future world. He is introduced to the massive city of "Nuiore," the future development of New York City; and he travels with his guide to Utis's home in the suburbs. He learns from Utis and others about the structure and institutions of this future society.
The social and technological.
The book concentrates most of its attention on the social and technological advances of the ninety-sixth century; and some of Macnie's forecasts and predictions are notably prescient. The one most often cited in criticism and commentary is Macnie's prediction that the paved roads of the future will have white lines running down their centers to divide the traffic flow. Macnie also forecasts advances in communication, with a global telephone network, and recorded lectures by college professors, among other developments that have come to pass in the ensuing centuries. Some of Macnie's anticipations are more characteristic of the early twenty-first century, like electric cars, and rooftop gardens on public and private buildings (a feature of the modern "green building" movement).
At one point in "The Diothas", the narrator meets an elderly astronomer who has developed a "calculating machine" that can draw geometric figures, and can also begin with a geometric curve and then display the formula it represents—tasks done by modern computers and computer graphics.
Macnie's future has progressive, egalitarian, and semi-socialist elements. The genders have fairly similar rights (though only males have to perform a type of national service). Some gender roles persist; 
all men are given some training in law, and all women in medicine. 
The majority of scientists are male, the majority of artists are female. Yet women inventors have been primarily responsible for the development of "varzeo" and "lizeo" ("far-seeing" and "live-seeing")—that is, television and motion pictures.
Women do domestic laundry and cooking—but communally. The average work day is three hours long; people devote their abundant leisure time to the arts and sciences and to further education. A form of capitalism exists, though there are limits on inherited wealth. Workers in business enterprises are often shareholders also. 
Macnie does envision a significant element of Puritanism in his future society, with Prohibition of alcohol and laws against marital infidelity. The author's conservative opinions are partly represented by his future. He condemns the authors Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens as "maudlin sympathizers with crime..." He even includes in his future the old Roman practice in which "the father had unquestioned power of life and death over his children."
The personal.
There are personal aspects to the novel as well: the narrator meets and becomes enamored of a young woman named Reva Diotha. (She and her female relatives are "the Diothas" of the title). Cleverly, Macnie complicates the frame of his narrative: the narrator is, in his own perception, a time-traveller from the nineteenth century—but he is known by the other characters as a friend and relative named Ismar Thiusen who has developed a mental illness, and who has the delusion that he is a time-traveller from the nineteenth century. (The narrator arrives in the 96th century able to speak its altered English language, in which the name of West Point has devolved into "Uespa," St. Louis into "Salu," and Buffalo into "Falo.") Utis treats Thiusen rather like a psychiatric patient; Utis humors his friend's delusion and explains the features of their world, as a kind of therapy meant to restore Thiusen to his proper wits. 
Once Thiusen and Reva Diotha are matched as a couple, they interpret his situation in terms of reincarnation.
In the end, however, Thiusen returns to the nineteenth century, after an accidental plunge over Niagara Falls. There, he is united with Edith Alston, the woman he loves.
"The Diothas" and "Looking Backward".
It has long been recognized that a relationship exists between Macnie's "Diothas" and Bellamy's "Looking Backward". Both books send their first-person protagonists to the future via hypnotism; both protagonists were, in their own time, enamored of a woman named Edith; and each becomes enamored of a future descendant of his Edith. Both novels predict similar technological developments. Macnie and Bellamy are known to have corresponded about their ideas prior to the publication of their books. In the concluding chapter of "The Diothas", Edward Bellamy is the figure identified as "E—."
Macnie himself believed that Bellamy had introduced too many elements of "The Diothas" into his later book. Once "Looking Backward" proved a great best-seller after its 1888 publication, Macnie and his publisher released a second edition of their 1883 book, re-titling it Looking Forward; or, The Diothas (1890). Unfortunately, Macnie was then criticized for "plagiarizing" Bellamy's better-known work. Macnie's book tended to be confused among the many sequels and responses to "Looking Backward".
There is an obvious and major difference between the two works. Bellamy set his story in the near future, and suggested a program for realizing the changes he predicted and advocated. Macnie's plot is set so many "chiliads" in the future that no program for achieving his utopia could seem feasible.
"The Diothas" and "The Great Romance".
The relationship between "The Diothas" and "Looking Backward" is complicated by another prior work, "The Great Romance" (1881). This science-fiction novella was printed anonymously in New Zealand, and is extremely rare; it now exists only in a single copy in a library in Wellington. Yet despite the obscurity of "The Great Romance", Macnie may have known of it; he makes his hero in "The Diothas" a native of "Maoria," the New Zealand of his future. All three of these stories share common features.
The author.
John Macnie (1836–1909) was born in Scotland, and educated at the University of Glasgow; he received an honorary M.A. degree from Yale University in 1874. He was a professor at the University of North Dakota for two decades; he was hired as professor of English, French, and German in 1886, and retired as professor of French and Spanish languages and literature during 1906. The University of North Dakota's Macnie Hall was named after him. Macnie published "A Treatise on the Theory and Solution of Algebraic Equations" in 1876, and "Elements of Geometry, Plain and Solid" in 1895.

Ahmad Shah (Taliban)

Ahmad Shah (nom de guerre Mohammad Ismail; ca. 1970 – ca. April 2008) was a local (to the Kunar Province of Afghanistan) who commanded a group of fighters operating in eastern Afghanistan and was linked to Gulbadin Hekmatyar.
Ahmad Shah was from the Kuz Kunar District of Nangarhar Province. His full name was "Ahmad Shah Dara-I-Nur" meaning "Ahmad Shah of the Valley of the Enlightened Ones". While he was not part of the Taliban, he sought allegiance with them. He was most closely associated with Gulbadin Hekmatyar. He led a heavily armed group of Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM) fighters who ambushed a small team of four U.S. Navy SEALs and then shot down an MH-47 helicopter dispatched as part of a quick reaction force for the SEALs, killing a total of 19 U.S. special operations personnel during Operation Red Wings in late June 2005. In the fire fight with the four SEALs his group had an estimated 50-100 casualties as a result of a last stand by the four SEALs. The Marine Battalion that conceived and planned Operation Red Wings, the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment developed the operation to disrupt Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM) activity in the Pech District of the Kunar Province with a focus on Shah, who through human intelligence and signals intelligence they determined had a force of up to 35 fighters under his command after the heavy casualties he suffered by the Navy SEALs.
Subsequent to the SEAL ambush and MH-47 shootdown, Shah and his men escaped to Pakistan, where they produced a video from footage they shot of the ambush that included weapons and implements captured from the SEALs. In late July 2005, Shah and his men returned to the Kunar Province, and began attacking United States, Coalition, and Government of Afghanistan entities.
Ahmad Shah's cell was destroyed during Operation Whalers, which was planned and executed by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment. Operation Whalers, like Operation Red Wings, was planned to disrupt Anti-Coalition Militia activity in the region to further support ongoing stabilization efforts to ensure a safe voting environment for the September 18, 2005 Afghan National Parliamentary Elections. After Operation Whalers, Shah was unable to stage attacks in Afghanistan again.
Shah reportedly fought against the Taliban and al Qaeda in 2001. He eventually switched sides and later became a facilitator for foreign fighters traversing and operating in the challenging terrain of the northeast.
Shah was killed during a shootout with Pakistani police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in April 2008, after failing to stop at a security checkpoint whilst transporting a kidnapped trader. An official from Kunar Province stated that Shah had been the "most wanted terrorist in Kunar province."

Great Sierra Mine Historic Site

The Great Sierra Mine Historic Site preserves the site of the largest mining operation in what would become Yosemite National Park. The mine was located on Tioga Hill on the crest and eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, one of several claims intended to work the Sheepherder silver lode. The Sheepherder lode was discovered in 1860, and rediscovereed by shepherd Thomas Brusky, Jr., who staked a number of claims in the area. In 1881 all of the claims were bought out by the Great Sierra Consolidated Silver Mining Company and established the company town of Dana. Due to the 11,000 foot altitude the town was soon relocated to the bottom of the hill at Bennettville.
After an adit was driven 1784 feet into the side of the hill at an expenditure of $300,000, operations were closed down in 1884. They resumed with modern equipment in 1933, but did not find the Sheepherder Lode, and operations ceased for good.

The Bear Went Over the Mountain (song)

"The Bear Went Over the Mountain" is a popular children's song often sung to the tune of "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow". At one time the lyrics were sung to the tune of "We'll All go Down to Roswer". The public domain lyrics are of unknown origin.
Possible origin.
Deitsch folklorist Don Yoder postulates that the song may have its origins in Germanic traditions similar to Grundsaudaag, or Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day is known to have its roots in the behavior of badgers in Germany. In some German-speaking areas, however, the foxes or bears were seen as the weather prognosticators. When the behavior of the bear was considered, the belief was that the bear would come out of his lair to check whether he could see "over the mountain." If the weather were clear, the bear would put an end to hibernation and demolish his lair. If it rained or snowed, however, the bear would return to his lair for six more weeks. 
Lyrics.
These are the lyrics for "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow":
Alternate versions use "climbed over the mountain" in place of "went over the mountain" and "and what do you think he saw?" in place of "and all that he could see" or "to see what he could see."

Cass (film)

Cass is a 2008 British crime drama film. It stars Nonso Anozie as Cass Pennant and is directed by Jon S. Baird
Plot.
Cass is based on the true story of the life of Cass Pennant, adapted from his book. The film tells of how he was adopted by an elderly white couple in 1958 and brought up in Slade Green, an all-white area of London. Cass is forced to endure racist bullying on a daily basis from local children, who also ridicule his feminine sounding name, "Carol", a name give to him by his Jamaican biological parents. Cass adopts his new nickname after the boxer Cassius Clay. His adoptive father starts taking him to see West Ham United on a regular basis, and he becomes involved in hooliganism aged 14 after helping the Inter City Firm, the West Ham hooligan firm, fight Wolverhampton Wanderers supporters in 1972. 
Cass climbs the ranks of the ICF to become the leader in the early 1980s. Cass finds through violence the respect he never had and becomes addicted to the buzz of fighting. Cass leads the ICF to victories against large hooligan firms, such as Leeds in 1980, but becomes frustrated with the lack of publicity the ICF are receiving. So he creates cards with the infamous slogan, "Congratulations, you have just met the famous ICF", and gives a TV interview, increasing the firm's notoriety for humiliation, their speciality. However, the government under Margaret Thatcher begins to come down hard on hooliganism, and after an organised attack on a group of Newcastle United supporters, Cass is imprisoned for four years. Whilst in Wormwood Scrubs, Cass begins writing his autobiography, in the hope he can generate some income upon the book being published; however his writings are confiscated by the prison upon his release. 
Cass is delighted to receive a hero's welcome upon his return, and begins dating Elaine (Natalie Press). This, as well as Cass's rejection of his biological parents after their attempts to contact him, improves his relationship with his adoptive parents after they began to disapprove of his violent lifestyle. Despite having a good relationship with Elaine, Cass is still lured to the violence of hooliganism, and when one of his best friends, Prentice (Gavin Brocker), is attacked by Arsenal supporters with knives, Cass seeks revenge. He is stabbed in the following fight, and Elaine is disgusted, fearing he is returning to his old ways, as she reveals she is pregnant with his child. 
As time progresses to the early 1990s, the ecstasy era takes over, and hooliganism becomes less of an attraction for Cass, and for many other hooligan firms. By 1992, he has settled down in Penge, South London, with his young son and Elaine, who is pregnant again. Cass gets a job as a bouncer outside nightclubs, working for Ray (Tamer Hassan), a long-time friend from his ICF days. However one evening, just after starting a shift at the nightclub, Cass is shot three times by the group of Arsenal supporters that he feuded with back in the 1980s. Cass survives, but wakes up to hear the tragic news that his mother has died. 
In the following weeks, Cass is haunted by his demons after the shooting; he sees visions of his attacker, he can't sleep and on one occasion, makes a violent outburst at his son. Cass's friend Ray has tracked down his attackers and offers Cass the opportunity to kill them. Cass is taken to a pub and holds a gun to his attacker's head at point-blank range, but decides not to pull the trigger. The film ends as Cass walks away from the pub and into the distance. 
Pennant himself plays a cameo role in the movie as the character "Biggs", who is one of the bouncers.

Footprints network

The Footprints Network
The Footprints Network is an online Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program that raises money from thousands of micro-donations collected as part of another e-commerce transaction. Founded by Worldnomads.com in 2005, it has since grown into a network of like-minded philanthropic travel companies who believe that travellers have a moral obligation to give something back to the communities in which they travel.
History.
The 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami provided the initial inspiration to create a program to do this with a simple checkbox on a single web site which invited customers to add $2.00 for a charity to the purchase of a travel insurance policy. Within a few months this had raised $50,000. Based on this surprise success, Footprints was re-engineered so that people could donate to location-specific, project based initiatives which improved collections still further and provided the donor with a tangible connection to their choice of project.
After the success of project-based donations, the team decided if they really wanted to make a BIG difference, they needed to share their technology with other e-businesses: to build a network of e-businesses across the globe willing to raise a lot more money for tangible charitable projects. 
And so it was that an API was developed making the technology available — for free — for e-businesses (Electronic business) to integrate into their web sites. More partners means reaching more customers and raising more money to fund more projects. All from $2 donations.

San Francisco Contemporary Music Players

The San Francisco Contemporary Music Players is an ensemble of classically trained instrumentalists that commissions, performs, and records innovative new music, including music that integrates electronic and acoustic sounds.
SFCMP was founded to give voice to the burgeoning genre of contemporary chamber music in the Bay Area. Led by Artistic Director Steven Schick, the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players is the longest-standing, continuously performing new music ensemble outside the East Coast. They are solely devoted to contemporary repertoire, particularly the work of living composers. 
History.
In 1971, composer Charles Boone began organizing a series of avant-garde music concerts in San Francisco art galleries. He called the series BYOP (Bring Your Own Pillow), because audience members sat on the floor. Three years later, his colleagues, harpist Marcella DeCray and oboist/conductor Jean-Louis LeRoux, reorganized the concert series as a nonprofit corporation and began to recruit musicians to form its core ensemble.
A ten-time winner of the national ASCAP/Chamber Music America Award for Adventurous Programming of Contemporary Music, the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players has performed more than 1,100 contemporary works, including many U.S. and world premieres, and has commissioned new pieces from such composers as John Adams, John Cage, Fred Frith, Liza Lim, James Newton, and Julia Wolfe.
Now in their 42nd season, the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players give audience members and friends opportunities to discover musical repertoire that is new to them – and to use these experiences as ways to better understand, interact with, and enjoy their lives and our world.
Artistic collaborations.
In 1983, Frank Zappa led the ensemble in performing music by Edgard Varèse. The concert, which was emceed by Jefferson Airplane vocalist Grace Slick and held in the San Francisco Opera House, attracted an audience of more than 2,000 people. In 1997, electric guitarist Bill Frisell and drummer Joey Baron appeared as soloists with the ensemble, performing Steven Mackey’s concerto, "Deal". Later the same year, vocalist Dawn Upshaw appeared with the ensemble in a performance of George Crumb’s "Ancient Voices of Children".

Monteverdi Hai 450

The Monteverdi Hai 450 SS was a prototype and follow on to the 375 High Speed. It was intended to be a direct competitor to the top of the list super sports cars of Lamborghini, Ferrari and Maserati.
A magenta Hai 450 SS prototype debuted at the 1970 Geneva Auto Show. It had a V8 from Chrysler positioned behind the two front seats. It took its name from the output of the engine, and the German word for shark, Hai. The body was presumably designed by Trevor Fiore, of Carozzeria Fissore, although some sources credit Pietro Frua. A second car was made with a longer wheelbase and minor detail changes like door handles and red bodywork. This car was named the Hai 450 GTS to mark the changes.
Monteverdi initially planned to produce 49 copies, but the production was halted after the two prototypes. This is most likely due to the car's speculated $27,000 price tag, a considerable sum for such a car in that era. In the 1990s, two additional replicas from spare parts were made by Monteverdi, those now reside in the official Monteverdi Museum in Basel-Binningen.

The Central and Western District Council is considering installing a new escalator on Pound Lane, the Blake Garden area could well be on its way to becoming Hong Kong's next trendy neighbourhood. Urban planning critic John Batten, who has lived in the neighbourhood for nearly 20 years, is blunt about the prospects. "The escalator would be the death of the area," he said. Noise levels would increase, prices would go up and developers would be keen to exploit the area's 30-storey height limits. "You have to wonder who is pushing this idea behind the scenes," he said. The escalator's chief proponent has been the local branch of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, whose community relations officer, Kathy Siu Ka-yi, can be seen on dozens of posters and banners supporting the project.

Mary Alice Ford

Mary Alice Ford (April 23, 1935 – November 27, 2008) was a Republican politician from the U.S. state of Oregon. A native of California, the moderate and pro-choice Republican served in the Oregon House of Representatives for 15 consecutive years representing Washington County.
Early life.
Ford was born Mary Alice Hood in Los Angeles, California on April 23, 1935. Graduating from high school at South Pasadena High School in 1952, she enrolled at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in education in 1956 from the Stanford Graduate School of Education. She married William Ford in 1957 and they had three children; Thomas, John, and Sherilyn. She later divorced William Ford, but retained the last name. Ford was a stay at home mother.
Political career.
A pro-choice Republican, Ford was a member of the party's central committee for Washington County from 1973 until 1979. In 1979, she was appointed to the Oregon House of Representatives representing Garden Home in the eastern part of Washington County. Ford was appointed to the office after House member Mike Ragsdale resigned in order to be appointed to the Oregon State Senate. Ford won the seat in the next election and was re-elected six times, serving a total of eight terms, through the 1993 legislative session. As a legislator, she worked to promote social services and health care and was appointed to the Architectural and Transportation Barrier Compliance Board in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan. She served as chair of that board.
The 1992 Republican primary was a close election for Ford. The strength of her opponent, Sandra Nelson, reflected a changing Washington County Republican electorate that would sweep Ford out of office in the 1994 primary. At a debate at the Washington County Public Affairs Forum on Monday May 4, 1992 Ford and Nelson explained their differing views on various issues involving government interference in individual lives, and on the controversial Oregon Citizens Alliance. Nelson stated that if elected, she would roll back laws requiring helmets for motorcycle riders and also author legislation to allow parents the right to determine if their children need to wear seat belts in cars, stating "government decisions can cause children to suffer". Ford disagreed with Nelson, stating: "A lot of people choose not to be responsible, society pays for their indifference through indigent care and higher insurance premiums". On the Oregon Citizens Alliance, the candidates also differed in their approaches to the group. Nelson supported the group, even though she questioned some of its specific policies. Ford again found herself opposite of Nelson, believing that such groups with narrow goals are not good for the state. In the general election she defeated Dennis Doyle, a computer consultant, to win what would be her final term in the legislature. 
Ford lost her seat in the 1994 primary to Eileen Qutub, who went on to win the seat in the November election. She said of her opponents on the religious right after her defeat: "Quite frankly, I don't consider them Republicans, I consider them religious opportunists." In 1996, she ran to reclaim her House District 8 seat. "The Oregonian" endorsed her in the Republican primary saying, "she was respected by lawmakers from both parties and thus was able to deliver quality service to her constituents even when a member of the minority party. That, in essence, defines the role of a good legislator." She would go on to lose to conservative Bill Moshofsky.
Later years.
After leaving the legislature she was named one of four 1994 Women of Achievement by the Oregon Commission for Women. 
In 1998 Ford led a group of other moderate Republicans including Audrey McCall (wife of former Governor Tom McCall), Washington County Commission Chairman Tom Brian, Sen. Jeannette Hamby, former Secretary of State Clay Myers and Rep. Chuck Carpenter, and endorsed Democrat Ryan Deckert in his race against Republican Henri Schauffler. The support from Mary Alice Ford and other republicans was highly valuable as the GOP held a slim voter registration edge in house district 8 at the time.
During the 2006 election she was critical of the same negative campaign tactics by "right-wing Republicans" that had defeated her in 1994. She believed that Republican congressional candidate Mike Erickson's attacks against Congresswomen Darlene Hooley were "vicious and too egregious to let pass". 
Ford died on November 27, 2008 after suffering from a major stroke earlier in the week. Ford was interred at Sunset Hills Memorial Park in Portland, Oregon, on December 5, 2008.

USCGC Barataria (WAVP-381)

USCGC "Barataria" (WAVP-381), later WHEC-381, was a "Casco"-class United States Coast Guard cutter in service from 1949 to 1969.
Construction and U.S. Navy service.
"Barataria" began life as the United States Navy "Barnegat"-class seaplane tender USS "Barataria" (AVP-33). She was laid down on 19 April 1943 by Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, Washington, launched on 2 October 1943, and commissioned into the U.S. Navy on 13 August 1944. She operated in the Central Pacific and the Philippines during World War II, and at Okinawa, in China, and in Korea after the war ended. She was decommissioned on 24 July 1946 and placed in reserve at Naval Air Station Alameda in Alameda, California.
Transferred to the United States Coast Guard.
"Barnegat"-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed.
The U.S. Navy loaned "Barataria" to the Coast Guard on 17 September 1948. After undergoing conversion for use as a weather-reporting ship, she was commissioned into the Coast Guard service as USCGC "Barataria" (WAVP-381) on 10 January 1949.
North Atlantic service 1949-1967.
"Barataria" was stationed at Portland, Maine, on 1 August 1949, and it would remain her home port until January 1968. Her primary duty was to serve on ocean stations to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and-rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and engaged in law enforcement operations.
"Barataria" patrolled the America's Cup Race at Newport, Rhode Island, in September 1962.
When the Cuban Missile Crisis developed in October, 1962, "Barataria" was conducting an ocean station patrol on Ocean Station Echo in the shipping lanes east of Cuba. "Barataria" made contact with a Soviet freighter transporting a cargo of ballistic missiles and was ordered to shadow the freighter and await the arrival of a U.S. Navy warship which would conduct a boarding of the Soviet ship. "Barataria" remained at battle stations, Condition 2, and repeatedly attempted to establish communications with the Soviet ship. All attempts failed. A U.S. Navy destroyer based at Norfolk, Virginia, arrived and the Navy crew boarded the Soviet vessel.
"Barataria" won the Commander Eastern Area Gunnery Excellence Award in 1963 and the Military Readiness Award in 1965. On 1 May 1966 she was reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-381. On 26 September 1966 her period on loan to the Coast Guard ended when she was stricken from the Navy List and transferred permanently to the Coast Guard.
Vietnam War service 1967-1968.
On 1 April 1967, "Barataria" departed Portland, Maine, and moved to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. There she joined four other Coast Guard cutters -- USCGC "Gresham" (WHEC-387), USCGC "Yakutat" (WHEC-380), USCGC "Bering Strait" (WHEC-382), and USCGC "Half Moon" (WHEC-378) -- in forming Coast Guard Squadron Three. All five cutters were former "Barnegat"-class ships. "Gresham" became flagship of the squadron, which was designated Task Unit 70.8.6. Captain John E. Day, commander of the squadron, hoisted his pennant aboard "Gresham" upon activation of the squadron at Pearl Harbor on 24 April 1967.
Coast Guard Squadron Three was tasked to operate in conjunction with U.S. Navy forces in Operation Market Time, the interdiction of communist coastal arms and munitions traffic along the coastline of Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The squadrons other Vietnam War duties included naval gun fire support for ground forces, resupplying Coast Guard and Navy patrol boats, and search-and-rescue operations. The cutters departed Pearl Harbor on 26 April 1967 and reported to Commander, United States Seventh Fleet, for Market Time duty on 4 May 1967. They were joined by Navy radar picket destroyer escorts (DERs) of Escort Squadrons 5 and 7.
The ten Market Time ships arrived at Subic Bay in the Philippines on 10 May 1967. The five Coast Guard cutters and five Navy destroyer escorts continuously manned four Market Time stations off Vietnam, while only Navy warships served on two Taiwan patrol stations. One ship rotated duty as the station ship in Hong Kong. 
During her Vietnam War tour, "Barataria" was underway 83 percent of the time and cruised over without a major mechanical or electrical failure. Keeping a close watch on all moving craft in her surveillance area, "Barataria" detected, inspected, or boarded nearly 1,000 steel-hulled vessels traversing her area, any one of which could have been a trawler trying to sneak supplies to the enemy.
"Barataria" was called upon many times to use her main battery against enemy troops ashore who were engaged with allied forces; United States Army spotter planes reported all of "Barataria"s rounds on target, never once falling out of the target area. On one gunfire support mission, "Barataria" scored three direct hits on point targets which had been spotted by aircraft.
Pacific service 1968-1969.
"Barataria" returned to the United States on 12 January 1968 and was reassigned to San Francisco, California, which was her home port for the remainder of her Coast Guard career. She was used for law enforcement and search and rescue duties in the Pacific Ocean.
On 24 March 1968, "Barataria" sustained an engine-room explosion off Unimak Island in Alaska's Aleutian Islands.
From 21 May 1969 to 27 May 1969, "Barataria" rescued the crew of and stood by the Peruvian merchant ship "Yavari" southwest of San Francisco. "Yavari" sank before a salvage tug could arrive. 
Decommissioning and disposal.
"Barataria" was decommissioned on 29 August 1969. She was sold for scrapping in October 1970 to N.W. Kennedy Ltd. of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Didith Reyes

Maria Helen Bella Avenila Santamaria (September 17, 1949 – December 10, 2008), better known as Didith Reyes, was a Filipino actress and singer best known for recording a string of hit love ballads in the 1970s. Many music enthusiasts regard her as one of the Philippines' "Jukebox Queens", along with other singers popular during her time such as Claire dela Fuente, Amapola (Maria Cabase), Eva Eugenio, Leah Navarro, and Imelda Papin. She was notorious for accidentally exposing her breast, while singing "Bakit Ako Mahihiya?" during the 1977 FAMAS Awards Night.
Didith Reyes was last seen being interviewed two months before her death with TV Veteran Philippine Journalist Korina Sanchez about her retirement in the Music industry and her new life as a beauty salon owner.
Early life.
Born Maria Helen Bella Avenila Santamaria on September 17, 1949, Reyes was the elder of two children. Her early years were difficult. At age fifteen, she ran away from her home and was known to skip school to join singing contests while in high school at Santa Isabel College. After studying Fine Arts at St. Scholastica College, she joined the Circus band, which would lead her to overnight success.
Success.
After her stint with Circus band and Time Machine, Reyes signed up with Vicor Music Corporation as a solo recording artist. This was after she was found by lifelong friend, Normita Japitana, found her in Ermita. She would soon score her first hit single with the eponymous theme song to the 1975 film "Araw Araw Gabi Gabi", written by Willy Cruz. Her other hits included "Nananabik", "Hindi Kami Damong Ligaw", "Bakit Ako Mahihiya?", "Hatiin Natin Ang Gabi", and "Aliw". Her hits earned her the title "Jukebox Queen", which also is shared with her best friends, Claire dela Fuente, Leah Navarro, Eva Eugenio, and Imelda Papin. Reyes gained further acclaim when she won a Gold Prize and the Best performer at the 1977 Tokyo Music Festival. Her self-titled debut album, "Didith", was a platinum bestseller. She also held international concerts, particularly, in Japanese cities such as Kyoto and Tokyo.
Aside from singing, Reyes also tried acting through a role in the film "Mabango ang Bawat Bulalaklak". Her songs, "Hindi Kami Damong Ligaw" and "Nananabik", were also turned into a films starring her, as well as "Bakit Ako Mahihiya?", which earned her notoriety during duet with Rico J. Puno in a televised presentation of the song at the 1977 FAMAS Awards Night, when she accidentally exposed her breast while wearing a flimsy gown.
Her showbiz career is marred with controversy, as she had relationships with many men, particularly prominent businessmen, club owners, politicians and those from the military.
Later years.
Reyes's career stalled in the 1980s as she suffered from a drinking problem and drug addiction In her later years, Reyes reportedly suffered from depression. In 2006, she accused a former live-in partner Eulogio "Mang Ely" Disonglo with domestic abuse, leading to his eventual criminal conviction for violating the Anti-Violence Against Women and Children Law.
Reyes later worked as a receptionist and stylist at a hair salon. In 2002, she returned to show business with a featured role in the GMA Network drama anthology "Magpakailanman". She was supposed to revive her singing career in 2008.
Death.
Three days before she died on December 10, 2008 at Biñan, Laguna, Reyes claimed to have sustained injuries after having been sideswiped by a vehicle. She died in her sleep at the home of a friend. The cause of her death was not immediately clear. Some sources attributed her death to a recurrent stomach problem, while her friend, the singer Claire de la Fuente, said that Reyes died of an apparent heart attack as her pancreas ruptured. A police investigation has been initiated to establish the cause of her death. An autopsy revealed that Reyes had suffered from an enlarged heart and clogged arteries, lending further credence to the belief that the singer had suffered a fatal heart attack. Her wake was held in Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Quezon City. She was survived by her son Arvi, from her previous marriage to Victor Reyes.

John W. Fuller

John Wallace Fuller (July 28, 1827 – March 12, 1891) was a British-born American publisher, businessman, and soldier. He served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. After the war Fuller engaged in the wholesale footwear trade as well as in civil affairs in Ohio.
Early life and career.
John W. Fuller was born in the village of Harston, located in the English county of Cambridgeshire. His father was a minister of the Baptist faith and also a graduate of Bristol College in England, and was responsible for much of Fuller's primary education. In 1833 Fuller relocated with the family to Oneida County, New York. There the rest of his education came from reading in a bookstore in Utica, and starting in 1841 Fuller began working there.
By 1852 Fuller owned and operated a publishing business in Utica, and later was the city's treasurer. He was also active in the New York State Militia, serving as an officer. In 1853 Fuller married Anna B. Rathbun, also a resident of Utica. The couple would have six children together; three sons named Edward, Rathbun, and Frederick, and three daughters named Florence (later married to Thomas A. Taylor), Jennie, and Irene. In 1858 Fuller's business was destroyed by a fire, and he moved to Toledo, Ohio, where he again began operating a book publishing firm.
Civil War service.
When the American Civil War began in 1861, Fuller chose to follow his home state and the Union cause. He was ordered to train soldiers in Grafton, Virginia, which is in modern-day Taylor County, West Virginia. He also briefly served on the staff of Brig. Gen. Charles W. Hill. On August 18 Fuller was given command of the 27th Ohio Infantry with the rank of colonel. Fuller and the 27th first served in Missouri under Brig. Gens. John Pope and David Hunter. He and his command then participated in Pope's efforts at New Madrid on March 14, and then the Battle of Island Number Ten from February 28 to April 8, 1862.
In the fall of 1862 Fuller was given brigade command in the Army of the Mississippi. He led it in Mississippi during the Battle of Iuka on September 19, and the Second Battle of Corinth on October 3–4. On December 31 his command fought at Battle of Parker's Cross Roads in Tennessee. During the battle, Fuller's brigade approached undetected and got behind Confederate Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest's position. Left with no choice but to attack the Federal forces in his front and rear, Forrest had his men charge and repel Fuller's command, and then quickly reverse and move past and through the rest of the Union soldiers. Fuller and the other Federal units managed to capture six pieces of artillery, about 300 prisoners, and 350 horses, but Forrest's scattered men were able to escape and recrossed the Tennessee River four days later.
Fuller spent most 1863 on garrison duty within the Army of the Tennessee, and was promoted to brigadier general on January 5, 1864.
In March 1864 Fuller led his command across the Tennessee River and captured the city of Decatur, Alabama. He participated in the Atlanta Campaign that summer, and temporarily lead a division during the Battle of Atlanta on July 22. He again led his brigade during the March to the Sea in late 1864, and in the Carolinas Campaign of 1865. Fuller was brevetted to the rank of major general in the Union Army on March 13, and after the end of the war he resigned that fall.
Fuller was one of the few generals in the Civil War who was not born in the United States.
Postbellum.
Fuller resigned from the Union Army on August 15, 1865, and returned to his civilian life in Ohio. He was the senior partner of the firm Fuller, Childs & Company in Toledo, a business dealing in the wholesale of boots and shoes. In 1874 Fuller was appointed the collector of customs for Toledo, a post he held until 1881.
On October 3–4, 1878, the members of the "Ohio Brigade" held a reunion at Columbus, Ohio, in which Fuller attended and made a speech. During the event a permanent organization was created for future reunions, with Fuller as its first president. In 1888 he retired from his business concerns.
Fuller was in Toledo when he died in 1891, and was buried in the city's Woodlawn Cemetery.

Grand Final.
English-born Melbourne young gun Gareth Widdop clinched the Toyota Cup grand final for the Storm with a 74th minute try and pressure conversion, his side downing the Wests Tigers 24-22 on Sunday.
Widdop finger-nailed a late grubber - his second try of the match - to draw his side level at 22-22 before calmly potting the conversion and delivering the second version of the national under-20s competition to Melbourne.
The Storm scored four of their five tries in the first half to lead 18-10 at the break before a burst of two four-pointers in three minutes from the Tigers took them to a 22-18 lead after 56 minutes.
The Tigers had looked to be coming home with a wet sail before Widdop,who missed three first-half conversions, made the difference in a match where the lead changed five times.
The match became a virtual showdown between two gun fullbacks as Wests Tigers tryscoring machine Jake Mullaney took his season tally to 29 tries from 27 games in 2009 with a double of his own.
The speedy Tigers fullback also scored a try on either side of halftime and set up five-eighth Robert Lui's four-pointer for the Tigers' second-half lead.
Melbourne, who finished third in the regular season, had held the ascendancy before that, and led 18-10 at the break with, ironically, Widdop's goal-kicking letting his side down.
The Storm had also been denied three times in the first half, twice with players held up, but scored tries through winger Matt Duffie, lock Billy Rogers, Gareth Widdop and centre Justin O'Neill.

Swype

Swype is a virtual keyboard for touchscreen smartphones and tablets originally developed by Swype Inc. where the user enters words by sliding a finger or stylus from the first letter of a word to its last letter, lifting only between words. It uses error-correction algorithms and a language model to guess the intended word. It also includes a predictive text system, handwriting and speech recognition support. Swype was first commercially available on the Samsung Omnia II running Windows Mobile. and was originally pre-loaded on specific devices.
In October, 2011, Swype Inc. was acquired by Nuance Communications where the company continued its development and implemented its speech recognition algorithm, Dragon Dictation.
Software.
Swype consists of three major components that contribute to its accuracy and speed: an input path analyzer, word search engine with corresponding database, and a manufacturer customizable interface.
The creators of Swype predict that users will achieve over 50 words per minute, with the chief technical officer (CTO) and founder Cliff Kushler claiming to have reached 55 words per minute.

Deer–vehicle collisions

A deer-vehicle collision occurs when one or more deer and a human-operated vehicle collide on a roadway. It can result in deer fatality, property damage, and human injury and/or death.
In 2000, of the 6.1 million lightweight motor vehicle collisions reported in the US, 1 million involved animal-vehicle collisions. Deer–vehicle collisions lead to about 200 human deaths and $1.1 billion in property damage every year. State and federal governments, insurance companies, and drivers spend an addition $3 billion in an effort to reduce and manage the increasing number of deer-vehicle collisions. The term “deer-vehicle collision” is commonly annotated throughout safety agencies as DVC.
History.
Deer–vehicle collisions have occurred since roadways have been built in close and direct proximity to direct habitat, also known as deer habitat fragmentation. White-tailed deer, the most common deer involved in deer-vehicle collisions, have steadily increased in numbers since the turn of the 20th century. Currently, it is estimated that 20 to 30 million deer populate North America. The actual number of animals killed in deer-vehicle collisions is not known because no such database exists. In 1981 study, it was concluded that “large animals,” which included deer, accounted for 26% of animals killed each year in collisions with vehicles on interstates and country roads.
The expansion and technological advances of roadways in the US have increased the number of deer-vehicle collisions. The increased amount of habitat fragmentation, due to expanding technology, has increased the likelihood of a deer-vehicle collision.
Contributing factors.
The main contributing factor of a deer-vehicle collision has been contested among studies and statistics. Many factors are yet to be identified or understood. At this point, a main factor in all deer-vehicle collisions has not been concluded, but the most argued is the proximity of roadways to deer-populated forestry. Significant factors also include: urban population and deer density. Also, studies have shown that, nationally, most deer vehicle collisions occur between May and November because of deer mating season and foraging before the winter months.
Habitat fragmentation.
Habitat fragmentation occurs when human technology encroaches upon the natural habitats of animals. As human beings live in closer proximity to animals they are more likely to encounter one another. The most common type of habitat fragmentation across the United States is roadways and highways in forests and other deer-inhabited areas. Because highways are isolated points of fragmentation, deer wander about them freely because they see little to stay away from. Roadways and highways located in sparsely-populated areas are usually built along rives and lakes of mountains and plains. These areas attract deer because they render safe havens and excellent foraging. Roadways and highways within densely populated deer habitat lead to more prevalent deer-vehicle collisions.
Time of day.
A contributing factor to deer-vehicle collisions, as preventable as it is prevalent, is the time of day at which motorists travel through deer habitation. During the daytime, motorists can more easily see and avoid hitting deer. At night, most especially during the dusk and dawn hours, deer are much harder to see, and therefore easier to hit.
Low abundance or lack of large predators, such as pumas and wolf.
The most important but largely overlooked contributing factor to deer - vehicle collisions is the reduction of populations of top predators. One of the most significant effects of the large predators is the control of populations of large herbivores, such as white tailed deer. It has been estimated that deer populations in Eurasia and North America are six times lower in areas with wolf than in areas without wolf. Since wolf and puma´s populations have been extirpated or reduced from most of the USA populations of deer have become superabundant. It can be easily estimated that vehicle collitions would be much lower if these top predatos were present and ecologically functional. More than 100 lives and millions of dollars in property damage will be saved in the USA alone just by being more tolerant to these animals.
Premier technological prevention.
The US Government does not sanction any specific manufacturer that may reduce or monitor deer-vehicle collisions. The investigation and implication of deer-vehicle collision prevention methods remains a responsibility of state governments. Such products are usually heavily tested and studied before being endorsed by them. State organizations such as the departments of transportation or game and fisheries usually handle the investigation of deer-vehicle collision prevention methods and products. State wildlife agencies have much concern for the preservation of deer and other wildlife that become involved in vehicle collisions due to roadway expansion and development.
Deer whistle.
The deer whistle is the most widely studied and scrutinized form of deer-vehicle collision prevention method. Deer whistles are products that attach to a vehicle and act as an alarm system for deer and other wildlife. The manufacturing of deer whistle products has emerged into a multimillion-dollar industry. Their manufacturers advertise that ultrasound, which they say deer can hear but humans cannot is emitted as air passes through the whistle. Most deer whistles are about 2 inches long and are bullet shaped. They cost between $20 and $25 and are designed to be attached to the bumper of a vehicle. When a vehicle moves faster than 35 mph, a whistle sound is induced which is believed to ward off animals from a roadway. The deer whistle is marketed to prevent deer-vehicle collisions. The effectiveness of deer whistles is disputed among agencies because of the conflicting reports available. The study and documentation of deer whistles is generally poor, and a conclusive decision about the effectiveness of the deer whistle cannot be made.
Some research has been published about the function and capability of deer whistles. Deer have an auditory range of two to six kilohertz (kHz), but only a select few deer whistle products have ranges within that of a deer’s. Some manufacturers claim that deer can hear the whistle up to a quarter-mile away, but no research has solidified that claim. Another point of concern is that the amount of noise from a vehicle may compromise the clarity of the deer whistle. Because the whistle is vehicle-mounted there is little that can be done about mitigating vehicle noise. Others also argue the whistle’s location on the vehicle as being susceptible to dirt and insects which would eventually clog the passageway of the whistle, rendering it useless. The idea of a non-air-activated whistle has been discussed but little research has been done on the effectiveness of such products, and is highly recommended. Deer whistles generally have a questionable level of effectiveness but are advertised as aiding in the prevention of DVCs. A concern amongst studies is the impact the whistle has on the psyche of the driver, and the driver’s sense of security.

Hardy Cup

The W. G. Hardy Trophy, more commonly referred to as the Hardy Cup, was the Canadian national Intermediate "A" ice hockey championship from 1967 until 1984. From 1985 until 1990, the Hardy Cup was the Canadian national senior championship for Senior "AA" after senior and intermediate hockey were merged by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association. The trophy was retired to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1990.
For years, up until the 1967-68 season, the Intermediate level had many regional championships. The most prominent was for the Edmonton Journal Trophy, the Western Canadian Intermediate "A" Crown. In Ontario, at some times, the Intermediate champions were included in Allan Cup Senior "A" playoffs as well.
In 1984, the Intermediate level was collapsed by the CAHA into senior hockey and the Hardy Cup was reclassified to be the Senior "AA" crown, one level down from the Senior "AAA" Allan Cup. Senior "AA" was unsustainable at the national level and the trophy was retired soon after.
Most Championships by Province.
This is a list of champions by province, territory, or state. From 1968, the Hardy Cup was awarded 23 times.

Charles Hedges

Sir Charles Hedges (1649/50 – 10 June 1714), of Compton Bassett, Wiltshire, an English lawyer and politician, was a judge in Admiralty Court who later served as one of Queen Anne's Secretaries of State.
Life.
He was the son of Henry Hedges of Wanborough, Wiltshire, and his wife Margaret, daughter of Richard Pleydell of Childrey, Berkshire; he was educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (matriculated 1666, B.A. 1670, M.A. of Magdalen College 1673, and D.C.L. with support of the Duke of Ormonde, Chancellor of the University 1675). By patent for life he was created chancellor and vicar-general of the diocese of Rochester in 1686, where he was an advocate of moderation in a feverish time, and master of the faculties and judge of the Admiralty Court under William III, succeeding Sir Richard Raines, 1 June 1689, in which post he remained until his death, his expertise serving Parliament on numerous occasions. He was knighted shortly after his accession, on 4 June 1689.
He was returned as M.P. for Orford in 1698, under the aegis of Ormonde as Chancellor of Oxford, but after counter-petitions were presented, Hedges and his colleagues were unseated by an election committee (1 February 1700), confirmed in the House by a majority of one vote (10 February)
In the brief parliament of February 1701 he sat for Dover, and at the election in November 1701 he was returned for Malmesbury and for Calne. His opponents endeavoured to eject him from both places, and the election for Calne was voided, but the petition against his return for Malmesbury failed. At the next election (August 1703) he was again returned for both Calne and Malmesbury and elected to serve for Calne. He unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Calne again in 1705 and 1708, but nevertheless retained a seat in parliament, as he was thrice (1705, 1708, 1710) returned for West Looe, and once (1713) for East Looe.
He was a Tory supporter of Court policy, a client of Lord Rochester in contemporary eyes, but with manifest talent as a civilian lawyer, who usually voted his own individual interest. Mainly through the influence of the Earl of Rochester he was sworn as secretary of state and privy councillor (5 November 1700), when he was allowed by special permission of the king to remain judge of the Admiralty Court, and he continued to be judge until 29 Dec. 1701. The Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, supporting the Whig interest, said of him, "He has no capacity, no quality nor interest, nor ever could have been in that post but that everybody knows my Lord Rochester cares for nothing, so much as a man that he thinks will depend upon him'" He attended Queen Anne to Bath in August 1702, and for a short time (April to May 1704) he was declared the sole secretary, both home and foreign, until a successor was appointed to the Earl of Nottingham.
During 1706 the Whigs constantly endeavored to eject him from office in order to make room for the Earl of Sunderland, and the queen at last submitted. The change was announced on 8 December 1706, but Hedges was mollified by promise of an appointment to the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, which came about in January 1711 on its vacation by Sir Richard Raines.
He sat in the commission for the rebuilding of St. Paul's Cathedral. In November 1711 he was rumored to be considered for the third plenipotentiary to negotiate the treaty of Utrecht, but it never came to pass.
His chief residence was from 1696 at Richmond Green, Surrey, but in 1700 he bought the estate of Compton Camberwell, in Compton Bassett, Wiltshire, near his constituency of Calne; the Hedges arms are still preserved around the parapet of the house. He owned much property in Wiltshire and was buried at Wanborough.
Family.
His widow, Eleanor, daughter of George Smith, a proctor in London, died in 1733, and was also buried at Wanborough. They had one daughter Anne and three sons, Henry, William, and Charles.
His second cousin Sir William Hedges, a director of the Bank of England, had directed the Levant Company's "factory" at Constantinople.

Burnt House

The Burnt House is an excavated house from the Second Temple period situated six metres below current street level in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem.
History.
The Burnt House is believed to have been set on fire during the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. According to Josephus, Jerusalem's Upper City was known for its wealth. It was located close to the Temple and inhabited by priestly families who served in the temple. The house was destroyed one month after the Temple and Lower City. When the Romans stormed the Upper City, they found little resistance: Much of the population was near death from disease and starvation.
Archaeological excavations.
Following the Six-Day War the Jewish quarter was rebuilt, and extensive archeological excavations were conducted in the area. The excavations were carried out from 1969 to 1982 under the auspices of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Israel Exploration Society and the Israel Department of Antiquities (today, the Israel Antiquities Authority). The excavations were headed by Dr. Nahman Avigad, and in 1970 one of the findings was The Burnt House which was found under a layer of ashes and destruction, indicating that the house had been burned down. 
The house is only part of a large complex, which could not be fully excavated and still lies under the Jewish Quarter. Coins were found in the house issued by the Roman governors of Judea, as well as those issued by the Jewish rebels in AD 67–69 and none that were later than that, indicating that the house was burned down at the end of this time. The ground floor of the Burnt House was exposed to reveal a house with an area of about 55 (32 ft) square. It included a small courtyard, four rooms, a kitchen and a Mikvah. The walls of the house, built of stones and cement and covered with a thick white plaster, were preserved to a height of about one meter. In the beaten-earth floors of the rooms were the sunken bases of round ovens made of brown clay, indicating perhaps that this wing of the house was used as a workshop.
The courtyard of the house was paved with stone, and through it one reached the kitchen and the other rooms. Three of these were medium-sized and a fourth, a side room, extremely small. The very small mikvah is covered with gray plaster and has four steps descending to its bottom. 
In the corner of the kitchen was a stove, basalt grinding-stones next to it, and a large stone tray. Several stone jars were also found in the kitchen. The occupants probably used the heavy stone kitchenware, rather than pottery, because according to Halacha they do not contract ritual impurity. This suggests the occupants were a priestly family, who had to maintain their cleanness in order to work at the temple. This is also indicated by the presence of the Mikvah. 
Throughout the house are stones burnt by an intense fire, scorched wooden beams and layers of ash and soot that testify to the huge fire that raged here. Its walls and wood-beamed ceilings collapsed in a conflagration, sealing an abundance of diverse objects in its rooms. And scattered in disarray among the collapsed walls, ceilings and the second story, were fragments of stone tables and many ceramic, stone and metal vessels, iron nails found in the ruins are all that was left of the wooden roof, the shelves and furnishings which were completely burnt.
Also found were inkwells, Roman-period oil lamps that were used to light up the house during the evenings, and other household items, the large jugs, bowls and measuring cups, indicating that this was a perfume production workshop. 
a covered drainage channel from the Roman period, According to the historian Josephus, some of the last Jewish rebels to hold out against the Romans hid in tunnels such as this.
In the room identified as the kitchen, the forearm bones from the finger tip to the elbow joint of a woman approximately 25 years old. Since the bone is almost certainly that of a Jewish woman, it was buried in accordance with Jewish law, but pictures are on display.
Leaning against a corner of another room was an iron spear, which may have belonged to one of the Jewish fighters who lived here.
Kathros family.
Also found in the house were a round stone weight, 10 cm in diameter, on it, in square Aramaic script was the Hebrew inscription (of) “Bar Kathros”, meaning the “son of Kathros,” this indicating that the house belonged to the Kathros family.
According to the Talmud, the Kathros family was a priestly family that had abused its position in the Temple. The Talmud describes them in Pesahim 57A in a poem that lists the priestly families that abused their positions in the temple as follows:<BR> 
The attack for misusing their pens may mean they spread false rumors or misinformation. Although someone may have carried this weight from another house, the Bar Kathros family certainly had a house in Jerusalem, given their priestly position, and this one is a good candidate.
Museum.
The excavated house is open to the public, and its artifacts are on display in the small museum near the room. The 12-minute audio-visual presentation, set up inside the house, plays back the nearly 2000 year-old events: the preparations of the revolt against the Romans, the different political opinions of the family members, news on the approaching Roman Legions, the destruction of the temple, the storming of both the city and the house, then ending with the torching of the house.

The Soldiers of Halla

The Soldiers of Halla is the tenth and final book in the "Pendragon Adventure" series by D. J. MacHale. It concludes the battle between the Travelers and Saint Dane. The title was revealed by D. J. MacHale on December 9, 2008, and was taken from a closing line in the preceding book, "Raven Rise". The jacket cover was revealed on March 3, 2009; the book itself was released on May 12, 2009.
Summary.
The Soldiers of Halla begins with the eleven Travelers, meeting in a crumbling wasteland of a city. They are immediately attacked by a helicopter, forcing them to seek refuge in the buildings. Bobby and Loor are trapped in a pit and watch as a colony of people are caught by the helicopters in a nearby building. When the helicopters leave, however, the Travelers gather back together. The first generation of Travelers quickly appear, such as Osa, Loor's mother, and Seegen, Kasha's father, and lead the other Travelers away. Bobby is met by his family again, who tell him that the wastleand was in fact the New York City zoo on Third Earth. His family leads Bobby to another place, that is filled with dark clouds and crumbling, dark matter. They confess that they know all that has transpired in Halla so far, including Bobby's murder of Alexander Naymeer on Second Earth. Moreover, they tell him that Solara is indeed the essence of Halla and thus the ten territories. Each victory and defeat inflicted by the Travelers and Saint Dane is reflected in the overall health of Solara. All of the souls of Halla are transferred to Solara after they pass on in Halla. As the exiles are in Eelong and the klees(cats that are the sentient species of the jungle like territory of Eelong) are going to attack them and the gars (humans that are not quite as intelligent as the klees.) The travelers defeat them and the travelers go back to Solara. Uncle Press then proposes that they should protect the exiles as they are the only positive energy that keeps Solara running. Bobby proposes that Uncle Press's plan would only delay defeat. He thinks they should make a portal and transport the exiles to the Ravinians on Third Earth and defeat the Ravinians. The plan is successful and they take the Ravinian conclave. Bobby finds and gets into a fight with Saint Dane, and as Saint Dane uses up all of his power, he dies. As the Travelers are victorious, all of Halla is saved from a fatal disaster. After he destroys Saint Dane, Bobby and the other travelers are allowed to live the life they would have had if they weren't travelers. The readers are shown Bobby and Courtney Chetwynde in a scene mirroring their first scene in the series. However, it is shown that rather than the young teens as before, this Bobby and Courtney are much older, Bobby himself being confined to a hospital bed. They kiss as a mysterious stranger ( Probably Uncle Press Tilton) barges into Bobby's hospital room and gives Bobby a box containing a "story". This "story" is actually Bobby's Journals. The series ends with Courtney reading aloud the first journal.

Her idol is Shabana Azmi who played an award winning role of a prostitute in ‘Mandi’.
Synopsis.
Memsahab is based on the cruel incidents post the 1984 riots between a section of Congress party activists and the Sikhs in Delhi and other parts of North India.. Ensuing these riots, the Sikhs were targeted by the Congress party activists and several Sikh families were ruined.
Yukta Mookhey plays the character of Anjali, who is a victim of the riots and is pushed into prostitution. This young girl Anjali’s mother is raped by the villains and her father is shot dead. What a horrifying impact would this have on the girl! This Anjali grows up with such traumatic memories of her childhood.
The director seeks to portray reality by actually shooting in a few bye lanes of Kamathipura (a red light area in Mumbai), where Anjali is one of the many women indulging in flesh trade. Every night, this woman has a new ‘Sahab’.
Some unexpected incidents take place and she stumbles upon the killers of her parents. She starts searching for them and hunting them one by one. In the process where she takes revenge on the killers of her dad, she realizes that the violence wouldn't help her get back her victimized parents. She then realizes that even after taking revenge she still could not erase her traumatic memories of childhood. Wisdom dawns on her and then she takes startling decision in the end.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack features seven songs including the item number "Piya Pardesia" picturized on Sambhavana Sheth. Music for the film is composed by Murlidhar Alia, with original lyrics by Ibrahim Ashq.

John Reppy

John D. Reppy (born February 16, 1932) is a physicist who studies the quantum properties of superfluids at Cornell University. He is also a notable rock climber of long standing, who established a number of widely known climbing routes particularly in the northeastern United States.
Rock climbing.
In the 1950s and 60s, Reppy was active on Ragged Mountain in Connecticut where he collaborated on many first ascents and on publishing an area guidebook with Sam Streibert. the well-known Reppy's Crack on Cannon Mountain in New Hampshire bears his name and he has made first ascents as of number of routes in the Shawangunks and elsewhere. He made early attempts on Armadillo, a long alpine rock climb on Mount Katahdin, Maine. In addition, he has climbed extensively in England, the Alps and western America.
Reppy has said his earliest interest in rock climbing as a very young teenager was related to the re-opening of small open-pit mica mines in eastern Connecticut during World War II in response to increased war-time demand for electronics materials.
Reppy was among the first climbers in the United States to practice so-called "clean climbing" techniques, which he learned in England. While most climbers of the day were hammering their way up the cliffs with pitons, Reppy helped introduce the use of nuts, which at the time consisted of hex nuts from truck wheels, strung with nylon webbing. Unlike pitons, nuts are placed and removed without the use of hammers and save the rock from permanent damage. The technique often makes placements easier and faster to achieve, and thus may make difficult climbs easier to complete. Many advances in rock climbing were made possible by this method. Among a substantial number of others deserving credit for this trend in the U.S. are Yvon Chouinard and John Stannard.
Scientific contributions.
Reppy received a Bachelor's degree in math and physics in 1954 at University of Connecticut and a master's degree from the same school two years later. He completed a Ph.D at Yale University in 1962, where he spent four years as an assistant professor. Reppy joined the Cornell Physics Department in 1966, later becoming the John Wetherill Professor of Physics. He is the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including the Fritz London Memorial Prize in 1981 and the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal for leadership and support to the NASA microgravity fundamental physics program in 2000. Reppy is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences.
As physics professor at Cornell University, he studies quantum properties of superfluids with an emphasis on boundary conditions and phase transitions in systems of reduced dimensionality. His research group has a close association with those of David M. Lee and Robert C. Richardson also of Cornell, who shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physics with Douglas D. Osheroff for discoveries related to super fluidity in helium-3 ice. Lee, in his Nobel Prize speech, credited Reppy's "extraordinary technical ingenuity" in experiments leading to the discovery. In the speech, Lee made other references to Reppy, noting that his work helped confirm related insights.
Reppy also figured at least on the fringes of the 2001 Nobel Prize for Physics which was awarded to Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman of the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics, or JILA, in Boulder, Colo., and Wolfgang Ketterle of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Bose-Einstein condensation was predicted in 1924, and was seen decades ago in liquid helium, according to Ketterle, who acknowledged a controversial earlier claim by Reppy. Ketterle says that Reppy brought this finding to his attention, and that the priority claim was fair. "I think the results appeared conclusive," Ketterle reportedly said. But co-laureate Wieman said that Reppy's claim is "really a stretch" and that Ketterle may have acknowledged the helium experiments merely to appease Reppy. "Ketterle is being gracious," Wieman reportedly said, "and Reppy makes a lot of noise."
Physicists generally agree that the atoms in superfluid helium-4 is not a Bose-Einstein condensate in the original sense of the term because its atoms interact too strongly. Reppy studied an exception: tiny amounts of helium trapped in nanometer-sized pores of a spongelike glass called Vycor. Even though the pores keep its atoms too far apart to jostle one another much, the helium still behaves like a three-dimensional fluid. In 1983 Reppy and colleagues reported results that suggested the helium was sloshing through the glass as a true Bose-Einstein condensate.
Separately, work from Cornell physics laboratories has been used to test a theory of cosmic strings, hypothetical objects, which may have been important in the formation of galaxies, and may have arisen through "phase transitions" in a fraction of a second after the Big Bang.

Tommy O'Connor (criminal)

Thomas "Terrible Tommy" O'Connor was a gangster who escaped from the Chicago, Illinois, courthouse in 1923, only four days before he was to have been executed at the Historical Gallows for the murder of a policeman.
Life.
O'Connor was born in County Limerick, Ireland around 1880 and immigrated to the United States as a boy. He first came to prominence when he was arrested after a shootout in which Chicago Police Detective Patrick J O'Neil was gunned down March 13, 1921. This came as a result of investigators coming to arrest him as a prime suspect in a previous case. O'Connor fled and was later arrested in St. Paul, Minnesota. They sent him back to Cook County, Illinois. Charged with Paddy's murder, O'Connor was convicted at trial and sentenced to hang. Four days before the scheduled execution, he and four other prisoners overpowered the guard, took his rifle, and escaped from the courthouse. All but two of the men were last seen dodging through traffic and made their escape. It is unknown how O'Connor died, though there is a tombstone at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Worth, Illinois. His year of death is listed as 1951.
After the escape.
O'Connor was last seen in 1921 during his escape. Because there was no Cook County Sheriff's Department during that time, he was able to make his way through miles of empty countryside and disappear completely. He then seemed to vanish forever with a fate unknown. Reported sightings continued into the thirties. One story labels O'Connor as the planner of a pharmacy robbery in 1927 where Detroit, Michigan police officer Stacy C. Mizner was shot and killed. A court order in the 1950s forced the city of Chicago to retain O'Connor's gallows sentencing and keep him on the death list until his fate was made known. The gallows were dismantled in 1977, but apparently O'Connor still remains scheduled to hang.
The gangster played by George Bancroft in the silent film "Underworld" (1927), directed by Josef von Sternberg was modelled on O'Connor. Playwright and screenwriter Ben Hecht loosely based character Earl Williams in the Broadway comedy "The Front Page" (1928) on O'Connor as well.

River continuum concept

The River Continuum Concept (RCC) is a model for classifying and describing flowing water, in addition to the classification of individual sections of waters after the occurrence of indicator organisms. The theory is based on the concept of dynamic equilibrium in which streamforms balance between physical parameters, such as width, depth, velocity, and sediment load, also taking into account biological factors. It offers the introduction to map out pure living communities, but also an explanation for their sequence in individual sections of water. This allows the structure of the river to be more predictable as to the biological properties of the water. The concept was first developed in 1980 by Robin L. Vannote, with fellow researchers at the Stroud Water Research Center.
Background.
The River Continuum Concept is based on the idea that a watercourse is an open ecosystem that is in constant interaction with the bank, and moving from source to mouth, constantly changing. Basis for this change in the overall system is due to the gradual change of physical environmental conditions such as the width, depth, water, flow characteristics, temperature, and the complexity of the water. According to Vannote's hypothesis, which is based on the physical geomorphological theory, structural and functional characteristics of stream communities are selected to conform to the most probable position or mean state of the physical system. As a river changes from headwaters to the lower reaches, there will be a change in the relationship between the production and consumption (respiration) of the material (P/R ratio).
Living communities and food types.
The continuous differences of properties within the river are dependent primarily on the specific composition of the organisms in different sections of the water. Throughout the continuum of the river, the proportion of the four major food types; shredders, collectors, grazers (scrapers) and predators change. With the exception of the predators, all these organisms feed directly from plant material (saprobes). 
Shredders.
Shredders are organisms that feed off of coarse particulate organic material(CPOM) such as small sections of leaves. They ingest the organic matter along with volunteer organisms (fungi, microorganisms) attached to the source. The preferred size of the CPOM is about one millimeter, therefore shredders must break it up into a finer particulate. In the process of shredding, much of the now finer organic matter is left in the system, making its way further downstream. Some common shredders of North American waters include the Mayfly (Ephemeroptera) and stone fly (Plecoptera) larvae, whereas decapods (particularly Atyid shrimp) fulfill the same role in tropical environments.
Collectors.
Collector organisms are designated by their use of traps or other adaptive features to filter and catch organic matter. The preferred particle size for collectors lies between 0.5 and 50 micrometers (UPOM = Ultrafine particulate organic matter and FPOM = fine particulate organic matter). This group includes fly larvae, nematodes, and many other animal groups.
Grazers.
The grazers (scrapers) feed off of periphyton that accumulates on larger structures such as stones, wood or large aquatic plants. These include snails, caddisflies (Glossosoma genus), and other organisms.
Because of the differences in the structure of organic matter at different sections in a river, the make up and frequency of these groups in a community vary. In the upper reaches of a river, shredders and collectors make up a large percentage of total macroinvertebrates due to the excess presence of coarse plant matter. In the midreaches of a stream or river, where more light is available, there is an increase in the proportion of grazers due to the presence of periphyton. Shredders only make up a small percentage of the total invertebrates due to the lack of coarse organic matter making its way downstream. In the lower reaches, organic matter has been shredded completely to the level of FPOM or UPOM (Ultra-fine Particulate Organic Matter). Due to the increase in fine particulate organic matter, collectors are the most abundant in the lower reaches, feeding off organic matter and surface films. The proportion of predators in all sections remains largely constant and only changes in species composition. The reason for the even distribution is that predators are not dependent on the size of the organic matter but on the availability of prey animals in the area. Atypical changes in the composition of these groups of organisms within a watercourse, such as an increased number of choppers in a major river area (mid to lower reach) or a lack of these organisms in the upper reaches, suggest a possible disturbance.
Division of the riverine.
The river continuum concept assigns different sections of a river into three rough classifications. These classifications apply to all river waters, from small streams to medium-sized and large rivers.
Headwaters (Stream order 1 to 3).
The creek area in the upper reaches or headwaters of a water system is usually very narrow and lined by thick shore vegetation. This prevents the penetration of sunlight, in turn decreasing the production of organic material through photosynthesis in the water. The majority of the organic matter that does make its way into the system is in the form allochthonous plant material that falls into the river, such as leaves and sticks. In this section, respiration (consumption) out paces production (P/R<1). Here shredders play a major role in breaking down coarse plant material. In this area, the largest diversity of organic material can be expected.
Midreaches (Stream order 4-6).
In the midreaches of a river, river structures such as rocks and trees play an important role as a supplier of organic material such as periphyton and other autochthonous (see limnology section of link) organic materials. The photosynthesis to respiration ratio is larger in this section and amounts to P: R> 1. The percentage of shredders in this area is less than that of the headwaters, due to lack of coarse plant particulate. Collectors and grazers make up a majority of the macro invertebrate structure in this area, with the predator's share remaining unchanged.
Lower reaches (Stream order >6).
In the lower reaches, there is a large flux in particulate material and also a decrease in production through photosynthesis, due to an increase in water cloudiness (turbidity) and surface film from suspended FPOM. Here, like the headwaters, respiration outpaces photosynthesis, making the ratio again less than 1 (P: R <1). The living community in these areas are made up of almost exclusively collectors, as well as a small share of predators.
Contributing factors.
The continuous changes down the water route are due to various factors. As described above, at its beginning, the river is very strongly influenced by material from outside the system, especially organic material which is consumed by various macroinvertebrates (mainly shredders). As you go further down the system there is an increase in autochthonous (i.e., within the system) production of organic material such as periphyton. The extent of this production varies depending on the amount of sunlight present. The last area is less dependent on the outside but still very much influenced by the degradation processes. In a continuous system without interference, such as by inflows, this development is possible in all river systems, with some variations occurring due to seasonal changes and other environmental factors (especially temperature).
Resources and stability of the system.
At any point in the system when organic material is added, it is used or stored, with a small proportion making its way further downstream. The existing energy is the limiting growth factor of the system, therefore the system is striving to be as efficient as possible. Free resources will enable new types of life in the community to establish, so that the excess resources are quickly exploited. This principle is not exclusively for river ecosystems but applies to most systems. Here, however, it plays a larger role, because resources are not spent in one place but are being constantly transported downstream.
The temporal aspect of this continuity can be seen by its daily and seasonal changes. In the course of a day there are many changes in the structure of living communities, mainly due to increased resource pressure during the day (better rate of detection) and abiotic factors such as changes of temperature and light. The midreaches are the most affected by daily periodic changes, because here there is the greatest biodiversity, each with different ideal conditions. 
Because there is a uniform use of resources and high stability, disturbances and fluctuations are usually corrected relatively quickly. Inequalities in the use of resources will be quickly compensated for, creating a new equilibrium. Also, there is no ecological development of the system (succession) and changes in the system are a result of outside geological changes, such as a change in the level of water making its way into the system, change of organic inputs or earthquakes. Even after these changes, however, it returns to a steady and modified equilibrium. This ensures that the ecosystem stays as an optimal functioning river system.
Development and application of the concept.
The first comprehensive presentation of the 1980 concept was part of a two-day conference at Stroud Water Research Center, whose head director was Robin Vannote. It was the result of a multi-year study conducted by the Rockefeller Foundation. The publication of the hypothesis was released later that same year under the title "The River Continuum Concept" in the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. The concept built on the work of other American limnologists such as Ruth Patrick, from which the modern riverine ecosystem model has emerged, and Luna Leopold, which deals with the physical changes of water. The essential goal of the concept was to further assess and explain the various communities in the system. Vannote himself described the current situation as follows, "in those days, most people studied a square meter of water to death ”. Meaning that previous research was always only on small pieces of water and only rarely was the entire river system considered, allowing for the creation of a general model. 
After its publication, the River Continuum Concept was adopted as the accepted model in the limnology community, becoming a favorite means for describing the communities living in flowing water. Here it broke the classic idea of riverine structure. Previous approaches had their disadvantages because they only described small zones of water and had no consideration for the system in its entirety. 
In practice, the River Continuum Concept is used today mainly for environmental assessment of rivers. River studies that assess riverine biological communities and have determined the species composition of an area can then be compared with the ideal species composition from the River Continuum Concept. From there, any variations in species composition may shed light on disturbances that might be occurring to offset the system.
Problems, limitations and modifications.
Although the River Continuum Concept is a broadly accepted theory, it is limited in its applicability. It describes a perfect and even model without taking into account changing riverine disturbances and irregularities. Disturbances such as congestion by dams or natural events such as shore flooding are not included in the model. 
Various researchers have since expanded the River Continuum Concept to account for such irregularities. For example, J.V. Ward and J.A. Stanford came up with the Serial Discontinuity Concept in 1983, which addresses the impact of geomorphologic disorders such as congestion and integrated inflows. The same authors presented the Hyporheic Corridor concept in 1993, in which the vertical (in depth) and lateral (from shore to shore) structural complexity of the river were connected. The flood pulse concept, developed by W.J. Junk in 1989, further modified by P.B. Bayley in 1990 and K. Tockner in 2000, takes into account the large amount of nutrients and organic material that makes its way into a river from the sediment of surrounding flooded land.

George Muter

George Muter was an early settler of Kentucky and served as chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals.
Early life and military career.
Muter was born in Madison County, Virginia (then a part of Orange County). He was the son of a German father and a Scottish mother. Little is known of his early life.
During the Revolutionary War, Muter served as Virginia's Commissioner of the War Office. In March 1781, Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben charged that Muter was responsible for inadequate availability of weapons and ammunition in the state. Muter learned of the charges before von Steuben brought them before the House of Burgesses and asked Governor Thomas Jefferson for a full investigation to clear his name. Jefferson expressed confidence in Muter, but the March 20 report of a special committee appointed by the House of Burgesses charged that Muter was not qualified to fill the position and ought to be removed from office. Muter resigned two days after the report was delivered. Thomas Speed also records that he was commander aboard a ship of war and attained the rank of colonel.
Relocation to Kentucky.
It is likely that Muter came to Kentucky in 1784. The Virginia legislature had appointed him to the district court of Kentucky in 1783, but did not assume the post until 1785. The court first convened in Harrodsburg, but was moved to Danville in 1783. On November 15, Muter succeeded Cyrus Griffin as chief justice of the court. 
Muter was a member of the German Reformed Church in Lexington, Kentucky. He was also the first president of the Caledonian Society, a nod to his Scottish heritage on his mother's side. He was one of the first trustees of Transylvania Seminary, which would eventually merge with Kentucky University to become Transylvania University. He was also named a trustee of the city of Danville in 1787.
In 1786, Muter was invited to become a member of the Danville Political Club, a debating society that also included Samuel McDowell and Harry Innes. He was accepted as a member on the motion of John Belli on February 17, 1787; the vote was unanimous. An undated note in the Club's records show that, even after Muter removed from Danville, the Club retained him as a member.
From 1785 to 1792, Muter was a delegate to all ten conventions called for the purpose of framing the first Kentucky Constitution. In 1785, he and Harry Innes were chosen to carry a petition for statehood to the Virginia legislature. 
When Kentucky achieved statehood in 1792, Muter was chosen as an elector to choose the state's governor and senators. The district court for Kentucky district was dissolved, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals was organized to replace it as the first court of last resort for the state. Muter's fellow district court judges, Caleb Wallace and Benjamin Sebastian, were immediately elevated to the court, but attorney general Harry Innes was elevated to chief justice instead of Muter. However, Innes was chosen by President George Washington as chief justice of the new U.S. district court for Kentucky; Innes immediately resigned to accept this position. The legislature chose Muter to replace Innes, who never presided over the court.
Muter presided over a meeting held in Lexington on May 24, 1794 for the purpose of addressing trade on the Mississippi River. The delegates to the meeting concluded that it was the duty of the United States Congress to secure free trade on the Mississippi from the Spanish, even if it meant the use of force.
In 1795, Muter and Sebastian rendered a decision against Kentucky pioneer Simon Kenton in a land title case. The decision was very unpopular with the people of Kentucky, and in December 1795, they petitioned the legislature to remove the two justices. The legislature failed to produce the two-thirds majority needed to remove the justices, but they were sternly rebuked. In May 1796, Muter joined with Caleb Wallace to express an opinion opposite his unpopular decision in October.
In 1806, Muter was pressured to retire from the bench, which he did on the condition that he would be paid a pension of three hundred dollars per year. The next legislature, however, repealed the pension. Governor Christopher Greenup, a past associate of Muter's, vetoed the repeal, but his veto was overridden. Because Muter had no family, his friend and fellow justice Thomas Todd invited Muter to live with him. In Muter's will, he left his entire estate to Todd.

Curiosity Kills the Cat (film)

Curiosity Kills the Cat () is a 2006 Chinese thriller film directed by Zhang Yibai. The film is set in the director's home city of Chongqing. Produced by China Vision Group and Eagle Spirit Management, "Curiosity Kills the Cat" stars Hu Jun, Liao Fan, as well as veteran Hong Kong actress Carina Lau. Though primarily a mainland Chinese production, international sales was handled by Hong Kong based Golden Network.
Lau would win a Best Actress Golden Rooster Award for her work in the film.
"Curiosity Kills the Cat" was to some critics, most notably "Variety's" Derek Elley, a prime example of the kind of popular but well-crafted entertainment that China's film industry had begun to produce.
Plot.
"Curiosity Kills the Cat" tells the same story of an affair gone sour in a modern Chinese city (in this case, Chongqing) from four separate perspectives. In the first part of the film, the story is told from the point-of-view of a young woman, Momo (Lin Yuan), who works in a photography store located in the same building as a luxury apartment complex. Momo has begun to secretly observe (and take pictures with her camera phone) John Zheng (Hu Jun) as he carries on an affair with Sharon (Song Jia), the owner of a nearby nail salon. Momo also observes John's unhappily married wife Rose (Carina Lau), as she suffers attacks from an unknown vandal who dumps paint on her car and windows.
In the film's second part, the story of John and Sharon is retold, this time from John's perspective and how he became involved with the younger woman. The story is retold once again in the film's third part, now from the perspective of a security guard (Liao Fan). In this part of the film, John and Rose's young child is kidnapped and a murder of one of the characters causes disarray to all the characters' lives.
Censorship.
In a bizarre turn, during the film's development process, a technician confiscated several reels for fear that the film's sex scenes would never make it past the censors. The technician, an employee at the Beijing Film Developing and Printing & Video Laboratory, refused to print the film or return the negatives. Ten years earlier, the same lab technician had been punished by the China Film Bureau over a similar matter, reportedly leading him to be "a bit jumpy." State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT) officials eventually had to contact the lab "consenting" to the film's production. The process still required that the filmmakers institute a number of extensive cuts.
The incident prompted the film's producer, Jimmy Wu to renew calls for a Chinese film rating system.
Oscar nomination bid.
In late 2006, "Curiosity Kills the Cat" made a bid to become China's nomination for best foreign film in the Academy Awards. The decision to push the film by producer Jimmy Wu was seen as odd in comparison to the previous six Chinese films to be selected, all of which were historical epics or high-budget wuxia pictures (such as Zhang Yimou's "Hero"). Wu argued that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had grown weary of the same historical films every year coming from China and that "Curiosity's" more realistic depiction of a modern China would appeal to judges. Despite the push, the nomination spot went to Zhang Yimou's historical epic "Curse of the Golden Flower" which was ultimately not selected to compete for the award. Wu, however, called for hearings suggesting that "Curse" violated Academy rules when its screening in China was switched, at the last moment, from Shenyang to Beijing.

Grande Ronde Valley

Geology.
The Grande Ronde Valley is part of the Columbia River Plateau. The Columbia River Plateau was created by a series of basalt flood eruptions. These happen when a long crack in the Earth's crust spews floods of lava. The molten rock then hardens and creates layers of basalt. The Grande Ronde Valley floor began to sink from this plateau at a rate of about .07-.18 millimeters per year about nine million years ago.
Geography.
The Grande Ronde Valley floor is at about above sea level. Its horizon is dominated by the Blue Mountains. Eagle Cap Wilderness is to the southeast. The highest nearby mountains are Mount Fanny to the east, with an elevation of ; Mount Harris to the northeast, elevation , and Mount Emily to the northwest, elevation . Communities within the valley include Cove, Imbler, Island City, La Grande, Summerville, and Union. The Grande Ronde River flows through the valley; its tributaries include Catherine, Fir, Ladd, Little, Mill, Pyles, and Willow creeks.
History.
Native Americans.
Eastern Oregon and the surrounding area was a haven for many Native American tribes. Many of these tribes, including the Nez Perce, Cayuse, Umatilla, Walla Walla, and Shoshone, would spend their summers in the bountiful Grande Ronde Valley. Here they would forage, hunt, fish, and bathe in hot springs. Tribes that may have been hostile toward each other would live together harmoniously in the "Valley of Peace".
First contact and settlement.
The Astor Expedition passed through the valley in 1811, and it was a waypoint along the Oregon Trail. Since the 1840s, settlers headed toward the Willamette Valley would pass through it. Every traveler who left a record of passing through the area was left with a favorable impression. Early pioneers chose not to settle in the valley, perhaps because they were intent upon reaching the Willamette Valley, it was too far from a supply base, or they feared the Native Americans in the area. The first permanent settlement in the Grande Ronde Valley was not established until 1861. The first permanent settler in the Grande Ronde Valley was Benjamin Brown, an Englishman who had originally settled in Michigan. Not long after, the Leasey family and about 20 others settled there. Serving as a travelers inn, the settlement was originally named Brown's Fort, and then Browns Town or Brownsville. Since there was already a Brownsville in Linn County, the name was changed to La Grande.
Growth.
Early settlements were in the more arable northern parts of the valley, as the southern end was subject to flooding, swampy, and contained alkaline soil. In 1862, Conrad Miller settled the opposite side of the valley. This settlement grew into the city of Union, the second largest community in the Grande Ronde Valley. Island City, Cove, and Summerville were not far behind. Many factors contributed to the growth of the valley. Some of these were the continuing presence of emigrants from the Oregon Trail, and the discovery of gold mines in the surrounding area, including at Baker in 1861 and the Powder River Mines in 1862.
Mormons were attracted to the valley after an 1889 business trip by David Eccles, Charles W. Nibley, and George Stoddard, who set up businesses in the area. Mormons followed and settled in the valley after then, and remained a prominent force until the Nibley-Stoddard mills were purchased or closed between 1920 and 1931. The influence of the Mormons in the area was limited, as all profits were sent to Utah, rather than staying with local businessmen.
Railroad.
Many railroad efforts were begun, including the Grande Ronde and Walla Walla Railroad Company in 1872 by H. J. Mecham and James Hendershott, as well as an effort to connect to Dorsey S. Baker's Walla Walla and Columbia River Railroad. The Grande Ronde and Walla Walla route was to be long but was never completed, and the connection from Walla Walla to the Columbia River covered and took six years to complete.
In 1878, several La Grande residents spearheaded an effort to build a railroad from La Grande to the Columbia River at Umatilla. They organized a company, called the Columbia River and Blue Mountain Railroad Company, and sent teams to Umatilla to begin grading. In 1879, the whole enterprise was surrendered to Henry Villard and his Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. The Oregon Railway and Navigation lines were to be joined to the Oregon Short Line and Union Pacific at Huntington, causing the valley to no longer be connected by difficult wagon roads. As one pioneer woman in the area wrote, "No more big, heavily loaded freight wagons with their wheels buried to the hub in mud." Two routes were proposed to exit the valley eastward, one that would put the railroad close to Union, and one that would put it close to La Grande. Both towns wanted the railroad, so a competition developed with both towns trying to please the engineers sent to survey the routes. Eventually the La Grande route was chosen. The railroad was completed in 1884.
The Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (OR&N) built a spur line from La Grande to Elgin. When the spur was completed, La Grande citizens paid $7,000 to OR&N.
The first logging railroads in the valley were built in 1907 for the Hilgard Lumber Company and Mecham Lumber Company, both owned by Charles W. Nibley with partners J. F. Nibley and Merrill Nibley. These temporary lines were long.
Transportation.
There are five main ways to get in and out of the Grande Ronde Valley.

Expenditure incidence is the effect of government expenditure upon the distribution of private incomes. This is commonly contrasted with benefit incidence as an approach to planning and measuring the effect of a government spending programme. A pioneering analysis of this was made by the economist Richard Musgrave in his major work, "The Theory of Public Finance".
Establishing the differential effect of expenditure in this way is difficult because the effect of differing policies upon taxation and overall expenditure must be normalised and it is hard to model and measure the flows of money which result.
An analysis will commonly be structured in three stages:

Immune adherence

Immune adherence was described by Nelson (1953) for an "in vitro" immunological reaction between normal erythrocytes and a wide variety of microorganisms sensitized with their individually specific antibody and complement; erythrocytes were observed to adhere to microorganisms. It was later recognized to occur "in vivo."
The phenomenon is now resolved as a complement-dependent binding reaction of erythrocytes to microorganisms where specific antibodies are engaged in the process. The reaction process is as follows: any microorganisms are bound with their specific antibodies, if they are produced, which activate the classical pathway of the complement system. The cascade begins to work from C1 to C3b through C4b, C3b being further transformed to iC3b (inactive derivative of C3b), all of which, C4b and thereafter, remain to bind to the surface of the microbe. Because primate erythrocytes express complement receptor 1 (CR1) on their surface and having binding specificity to C4b, C3b, or iC3b, erythrocytes accumulate on the microbe via CR1-complement binding.
Function of the immune adherence ("in vivo").
Human erythrocytes express 100 to 1,000 CR1 per cell, the average number of approximately 300 being an inherited characteristics. Immune complexes bound to erythrocytes are effectively removed from the circulation, which is presumed alternatively to prevent deposition at tissue sites, for example, the renal glomerulus. Erythrocytes bearing immune complexes traverse sinusoids of the liver and spleen, where they encounter fixed phagocytes. Phagocytes expressing CR1, CR3, and Fcγ receptors effect a transfer of the immune complexes to their surface. Then erythrocytes leave the liver and spleen bearing off immune complexes and work on the next round of transfer of immune complexes after adhering to them.

Three-point estimation

The three-point estimation technique is used in management and information systems applications for the construction of an approximate probability distribution representing the outcome of future events, based on very limited information. While the distribution used for the approximation might be a normal distribution, this is not always so and, for example a triangular distribution might be used, depending on the application.,
In three-point estimation, three figures are produced initially for every distribution that is required, based on prior experience or best-guesses:
These are then combined to yield either a full probability distribution, for later combination with distributions obtained similarly for other variables, or summary descriptors of the distribution, such as the mean, standard deviation or percentage points of the distribution. The accuracy attributed to the results derived can be no better than the accuracy inherent in the 3 initial points, and there are clear dangers in using an assumed form for an underlying distribution that itself has little basis.
Estimation.
Based on the assumption (possibly unwarranted) that a "double"-triangular distribution governs the data, several estimates are possible. These values are used to calculate an "E" value for the estimate and a standard deviation (SD) as L-estimators, where:
"E" is a weighted average which takes into account both the most optimistic and most pessimistic estimates provided. SD measures the variability or uncertainty in the estimate.
In Project Evaluation and Review Techniques (PERT) the three values are used to fit a Beta distribution for Monte Carlo simulations.
The triangular distribution is also commonly used. It differs from the double-triangular by its simple triangular shape and the mode does not have to coincide with the median. The mean (expectation) is then:
In some applications, the triangular distribution is used directly as an estimated probability distribution, rather than for the derivation of estimated statistics.
Project management.
To produce a project estimate the project manager:
The E and SD values are then used to convert the project estimates to confidence levels as follows:
These confidence level estimates assume that the data from all of the tasks combine to be approximately normal (see asymptotic normality). Typically, there would need to be 20–30 tasks for this to be reasonable, and each of the estimates E for the individual tasks would have to be unbiased.

Storey Hall

Storey Hall, located at 342–344 Swanston Street in Melbourne, Australia, is part of the RMIT City campus of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT University). It is home to RMIT Gallery, considered to be Melbourne's most vibrant art space, with a constantly changing exhibition program of architecture, craft, contemporary art, design, fashion, and fine art. 
The Hall is a 19th century building constructed in 1887 as a meeting hall once owned by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, which had been acquired by RMIT in 1957 and subsequently renovated, and officially opened in 1996.
The architectural design of the refurbished section of the building consists primarily of Penrose tiles, which are arranged to form pentagons. It was completed in 1995 to the design of Ashton Raggatt McDougall. The refurbished section is also externally adorned with Penrose tiles and is also styled with ruffles, keys and suspender belts to represent the Suffragettes, who formally used the building as a meeting hall.
The hall was named after the Storey family; John Storey (Junior), who founded the RMIT Student Union in 1944, and Sir John Storey (Senior), who left a large bequest to RMIT—in order to found the John Storey Junior Memorial Scholarships in memory of his son, whose studies were cut short in 1947 when he died of leukaemia at age 22.
The vaults of Storey Hall house the smaller RMIT First Site Gallery, which is operated by the RMIT Union, and has a focus on new media, as well as a cafe named re:vault.
Key Influences.
One of the key influences in the design of the Storey Hall annex is the use of scientific theory on tile patterns by Roger Penrose. Penrose’s tiling pattern has been incorporated into the design, with the street façade being highly decorative with complex geometric forms and materials that lack ornament. The most striking feature of the Façade is the rhombus shaped tiles that start to come out of the façade which sit on a concrete wall. The colours that were used on the street façade are bright and make a bold statement with the neon green referencing the Hibernian Hall’s Irish heritage and of the building’s former use by the Suffragette movement early in the nineteenth century. The interior also uses the Penrose tiling system with patterns and geometry with the foyer containing rough concrete walls and columns with a curved stairwell. The main auditorium’s ceiling is decorated with brightly coloured geometric Penrose tile patterns and textures which reflect the rest of the building. 
Storey Hall is both architecturally and historically significant as it has won numerous awards and combines both the historical and traditional aspects of the former Hibernian Hall to create a complex and daring building. 
Storey Hall incorporates the Deconstructivism style which became popular in the late 1980s and contrasts significantly with the highly ordered and rational postmodern building next to Storey Hall, Hibernian Hall. The De-constructivism style looks at contradiction and complexity and argues against purity, clarity and simplicity which is found in post-modern architecture and turns its back on minimalism. Deconstructivism took a confrontational stance towards architecture and architectural history, wanting to disjoin and disassemble architecture. 
Storey Hall was highly successfully in using computer and digital fabrications to enhance the design and was one of the first buildings in Melbourne to incorporate digital fabrication in its design in the 1990s.

Modern History of Taiwanese in 400 Years (台灣人四百年史), is a history book about Taiwan, written by Shi-Min, also known as Su Beng (史明, literally "History to be clarified") of the Taiwan Independence Movement.
Shi-Min felt many advocators of the Taiwan Independent Movement did not understand the history of Taiwan well, and spent three years writing a Japanese version of "Modern History of Taiwanese in 400 Years" in 1962. After another six years, he finished the Chinese version, and the English version was published in 1986. In 1999, he added an appendix for Chinese version. 
In the book, the author discusses the ruling characteristics of Kuomintang or KMT (國民黨, literally translated as "Chinese Nationalist Party") 
The book also analyses the basic structure of Taiwan's economy, to explain how different social classes in Taiwan were formed, and focuses on different eras of social, international position and trends. Shi-Ming's "Modern History of Taiwanese in 400 Years" has long been a main source for introducing Taiwan's history.

Citibank House

Citibank House is an 18-storey office building in Perth, Western Australia. The building was opened in 1962 as the "T & G Building", and was the tallest building in Perth until 1970 when Hamersley House was opened. It underwent a major refurbishment in the 1980s which significantly altered the building's external features. The building adopted its current name when Citibank became its flagship tenant. As of December 2008, the tower is the 26th-tallest completed building in Perth.
Site history and construction.
The site at the corner of St Georges Terrace and Barrack Street was occupied by hostelries from the colony's earliest days, and later housed the Weld Club.
During the Western Australian gold rush in 1897, the "Moir Building" was constructed on the site. Designed by Talbot Hobbs, the building was one of the most well-known buildings in Perth at the time. It later became the headquarters for the T & G Mutual Life Assurance Society and was renamed to the "T & G Chambers". The southern end of the site was also home to the McNeil Chambers.
New T & G Building.
Growth in T & G's business, coupled with a desire for a modern tower, led to the decision to demolish the iconic chambers. The original "T & G Chambers" were demolished in early 1960, and excavation for the new tower's foundation began in June 1960.
The high water table of the site necessitated the use of a raft-type foundation. The thick foundation was formed by the pour of of concrete in one continuous pour, which occurred on 25 September 1960. After this, a concrete retaining wall was poured around the basement levels and the steel frame of the building was erected. The floors of the building were formed by attaching permanent galvanised iron formwork to the steel frame, adding steel reinforcement mesh and pouring of concrete on top.
The building was the tallest in Perth upon its completion.
Design.
The T&G Building was designed by architects Forbes & Fitzhardinge.
The service tower on the building's west side housed the tower's services, including its four high-speed lifts, a lift lobby, electricity, plumbing, toilets, tea room and two escape stairwells. The containment of the services within the service tower enabled the of office space on each floor to be contiguous. The service tower rose above the roof of the main building.
The building is of a steel frame construction, clad with aluminium, glass and precast aggregate concrete panels. The building is supported by 32 steel columns. The ground floor was clad with black polished granite, and the lobby featured Travertine marble.
The office floors had external sun shades thick protruding from the side of the building to reduce the heat load of the building during summer.
The "fully automatic" lifts which were installed in the building were the most advanced in Australia.
A steel flag pole (incorporating a lightning conductor) was placed on the northern end of the service tower.
Refurbishment.
When the T & G Building was constructed, there were no plot ratio limits imposed by the City of Perth on multistorey developments, and the building had a plot ratio of approximately 7:1. However, subsequent to the construction, a limit of 5:1 was imposed. As a result, in the 1980s when the tower was already outdated and showing signs of age, the owners found that they would be unable to replace the tower with a new one of a similar size. As a result, a decision was made to extensively refurbish the building.
The roof of the building, which previously featured a small caretaker's flat, was fully enclosed as an extra office floor. Above this, a facade was added bringing all sides of the building to the top of the mechanical penthouse which previously rose several floors above the roof. The window shades above every floor were enlarged and extended outwards from the building, and all window glass was replaced.

In 2005, it received one of the largest grants ever given for MS research in the United States, a $25 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to study the effectiveness of combining two disease-modifying drugs, and the individual factors that determine disability.
The Center is a part of Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. Both the Center's Director, Fred D. Lublin, M.D., and the Center's Medical Director, Aaron E. Miller, M.D. are listed in New York Magazine's "Best Doctors of 2008."
History.
The Center was established in 2001 with a $5 million endowment from George J. Gillespie, III and Mount Sinai Hospital trustee Clifford H. Goldsmith. It is named in honor of Goldsmith's daughter, Corinne, who coped with the disease until her death in 1999.
Basic research.
The pathologic hallmarks of multiple sclerosis are central inflammation, blood–brain barrier permeability, demyelination, progressive axonal transection, and a reactive astrogliosis. Demyelination is associated with conduction deficits in affected nerves, including conduction block, a major cause of symptoms early in the disease, and has also been linked to axonal loss, which is associated with permanent deficits later in the disease course. Conversely, remyelination is associated with return of conduction and clinical recovery, but remyelination often fails as the disease progresses, for reasons that are not well understood.
Research in the CGD Center's laboratory (led by Dr. Gareth John) focuses on the mechanisms that control lesion formation and repair in MS. The laboratory is currently supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, biotech corporations, and private benefactors; work from the laboratory has been published in scientific journals including "Nature Medicine" and the "Journal of Neuroscience".
In a recent study, team members identified the soluble mediator interleukin-11 (IL-11) as a factor that potentiates the survival and maturation of oligodendrocytes, the cells in the brain that produce myelin and are the target of immune attack in MS. Interestingly, IL-11 expression is upregulated at the border of remyelinating lesions in MS, and it may represent a potential target for the design of new therapies to promote lesion repair. These findings were recently published (Zhang et al., J. Neurosci. 2006; 26:12174-85 PMID 17122042).
Using a related approach, members of the laboratory recently found that signaling through Notch1 receptors is activated in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) in MS lesions. In the developing CNS, Notch1 restricts OPC differentiation, and is permissive for progenitor expansion. Thus, activation of this pathway in the adult may regulate remyelination. To test this hypothesis, the laboratory has targeted Notch1 inactivation to early OPC in genetically modified animals, using OLIG1"Cre:Notch112f/12f" mice. They have found that remyelination is potentiated in these animals, whereas OPC proliferation is restricted. These results suggest regulation of Notch signaling as a therapeutic avenue to enhance remyelination in MS. They were recently submitted for publication.
These studies and others from the laboratory have produced findings that may be relevant to lesion repair in MS. They share a common molecular/cellular approach, beginning with target identification using functional genomics, and progressing through experiments in tissue culture models and into genetically modified animals. The long-term goal of this research is to identify novel therapeutic strategies for MS.
With new drug therapies emerging rapidly, the CGD Center has established a clinical trials program to design and implement tests of experimental agents and allow patients access to therapies not yet widely available.
Clinical care.
The CGD Center sees over 4,800 patients annually, 1,000 of whom each year are new. The Center utilizes a team of doctors, nurse practitioners, fellows, social workers, consultants and a psychiatrist in its integrated approach to enhancing the treatment of MS, attracting visiting neurologists and patients worldwide.
Community and patient support.
Many MS Centers provide additional resources with the understanding that some of the most immediate concerns of the newly diagnosed are not medical but social and psychological. In addition to providing full-time social workers for patients and their families through two LCSWs, the CGD Center is unique in providing the services of a psychiatrist trained in the psychiatric manifestations of MS. The Center also provides monthly patient education seminars discussing research and treatment topics.

Eviota pellucida

Eviota pellucida, commonly called Neon pygmy goby or '"Pellucida pygmy goby", is a species of marine fish in the family Gobiidae.
The Neon pygmy gobyis widespread throughout the tropical waters of the central Indo-Pacific.
It can be found at depths of 3-. 
It reaches a maximum size of in length. 
Its body is a transparent orange/red colour, with a yellow/gold line stretching from its head the base of its tail, one on its side stretching through its eye to 2/3 of the way down its body, and two lines over its head. All lines originate near the upper lip. A white line along the stomach is also present. 
Behavior.
Sticking to lagoonal areas with lots of shelter, these fishes are often found in groups, browsing for microinvertebrates (and seeking refuge) among the branches of small-polyped stony corals, as well as sometimes cleaning parasites and dead tissues from larger fish.
Captivity.
Occasionally making its way into the aquarium trade, this is a hardy little specimen. Its diet in captivity consists of small invertebrates including copepods and amphipod larvae, and they may occasionally be seen clearing other fish of parasites and dead tissues. They will sometimes accept pelleted foods and often frozen foods like mysis shrimp. An environment that is branchy or with many perches is most suitable, and SPS will often be enjoyed as a home. Macroalgaes and porous rock will provide lots of enjoyable browsing for these fish.

Maravarman Rajasimha II

Maravarman Rajasimha II was the last Pandyan king of the first Pandyan empire. He was the son and successor of Parantaka Viranarayana. He ruled the Pandyan kingdom from 900 to 920 AD.
Conquests.
He opposed the Chola king of Thanjavur at Kodumbalur and plundered the Chera capital at Vanchi in Kongu Nadu.
Defeats.
In 910 AD he suffered defeat at the hands of Parantaka Chola I, the son of Aditya Chola. Parantaka totally invaded the Pandyan kingdom and earned the title "Maduraikonda"(the one who captured Madurai). Rajasimha appealed to Kassapa V, the king of Ceylon for assistance. But even the combined forces of the Pandyas and the Sinhalese suffered could not keep the Cholas at bay and they suffered a huge defeat in Vellur near Madurai.
After the successive defeats, Rajasimha II fled to Ceylon but then unable to secure refuge, he went to Kerala, as he himself had descended in part from a chera king where he spent the rest of his days keeping a low profile.

<doc id="20622754" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20622754" title="Dragon Quest X">
Dragon Quest X

A "second version" titled was released on 5 December 2013 in Japan.
Generally praised by reviewers upon release, sales put the Wii version of the game as a top ten selling game in Japan in 2012.
Gameplay.
"Dragon Quest X" can only be played offline for a few hours and then needs to be played online to access all of the content. There is a monthly subscription fee. The game utilizes cloud storage for save files and other game data.
The game play is aligned with all other Dragon Quest games which include the traditional "RPG" style game play with a mix current MMOs. The player has access to an open-world environment which include random towns, enemies, quests and many secrets that lie hidden. With Dragon Quest X players are able to see the enemy on the map which they're able to choose to fight or flee. Being that its a "MMO", players will also be able to make a group with four other people. Like many other multiplayer games, there are quests and items to be found randomly and most players will begin their quest at "starting areas". Each race has its own unique town in which the players are able to socialize, barter, investigate, and do as they will.
Story.
Setting.
The game is set in a new world, Astoltia, featuring five continents and six playable races.
Characters.
The six races are Human, Ogre, Elf, Dwarf, Puklipo, and Weddie. Players will start as a human character, but after a certain point in the game, the character will become one of the other five races.
Plot.
The story begins on Etene village, focusing on the protagonist, an orphan living with his/her sibling. The peace is shattered when Nelgel, the Lord of Hell, attacks the village. At this point, the story branches off into 2 different perspectives, the first being an extended offline campaign, which follows the protagonist's sibling, who was sent into the past in order to be protected from Nelgel. The second perspective begins with the protagonist's soul being transported to a shrine where you ultimately decide which of the 5 races (Ogre, Weddie, Dwarf, Puklipo, and Elf) you would like to play as. As soon as your character design is finished, the protagonist's soul enters the body of the character you designed, which was originally just a corpse. After collecting 6 out of 10 sacred emblems, a sage attempts to create a bridge leading to Nelgel's lair. When it fails, he decides to separate the protagonist's soul from the body he/she was inhabiting in a desperate attempt to try another method. This proves to be successful, as the protagonist then meets the body's original owner. The protagonist's mission is made clear when he/she realizes that a sacred vessel called the Ark of the Heavens is the only thing that can penetrate Nelgel's defenses. The protagonist then travels 500 years into the past, where the Ark of the Heavens was last used in recorded history. After fighting Razban, a demon bent on bringing Nelgel to life, the protagonist forges a friendship bond with a young boy who knew the secret to using the Ark of the Heavens. Returning to the present, the protagonist entered Nelgel's lair, and after a long battle, emerged successful. After the ending credits roll by, the protagonist is greeted by the sage from before, who informs him/her that despite Nelgel's defeat, the seal he had on the central continent was still active.
Pre-release.
"Dragon Quest X" was formally announced by Yuji Horii on December 10, 2008 at a "Dragon Quest" conference, On September 5, 2011, Square Enix held a "Dragon Quest" conference where they showed a trailer and confirmed it was for Wii and Wii U. Players of both versions have access to the same world with cross-platform interaction. Upon the initial announcement of the game, Nintendo president and CEO Satoru Iwata compared the "Dragon Quest" series to the "Brain Age" series, which was also seen as unmarketable in the West, and declared that he would like to work closely with Square Enix to raise the series' international appeal.
In July 2013, Square Enix announced that a PC version of the game was being developed, with a release date of September 26, 2013.
Expectation.
It was rumored and speculated that an announcement of five Square Enix games in development would include "Dragon Quest X" by publications such as Video Gamer and IGN. It was also speculated that by MCVUK that it could be released on other formats since Horii never stated that it was exclusive, though noting that the last two "Dragon Quest" games were exclusive. The Escapist's Keane Ng speculated that because it was announced before 's release, it may be along in development. In response to a rumour of being announced on the Japanese variety show "Tama Newtown", Kotaku's Michael McWhertor found it suspicious that Square Enix, which according to him announces games "while top executives stand behind podiums in meeting rooms at Tokyo's Imperial Hotel", would announce such a significant title without "more fanfare." "Edge"s Rob Crossley commented that a multi-console release of "Dragon Quest X" for both the Wii and 3DS was a "distinct possibility" due to the "financial allure" of such a prospect. Michael Cunningham listed "Dragon Quest X" as a game that he hoped to see at E3 2010, though he admitted that it would be unlikely. A year later, Game Revolution contributor Heath Hindman also listed 'Something, Anything About Dragon Quest X' as a TGS Announcement he would like to see. Wired's Chris Kohler called it a "big win" for Wii owners and Nintendo's president Satoru Iwata. In discussing the fall in Wii sales in Japan, Kohler noted it as an example of a game that could potentially boost Wii sales. "Official Nintendo Magazine" described it as big news for Nintendo, due to its popularity. A collaboration of "Famitsu" readers and Japanese game shops named the simultaneous announcement of "Dragon Quest X" and the reveal of "Dragon Quest IX"s release date as the number one news item of 2008 in a year-end poll by "Famitsu". Retronauts contributor Jeremy Parish commented that while if the announcement of "Dragon Quest X" "filled (him) with interest", adding that if it had occurred one year before, he would have dismissed it as an example of the series' stagnation. GameSpot's Tom Magrino described it as a "measure of redemption" for Wii owners, after the "less-than-stellar" release of '. IGN's Matt Casamassina called it a surprise, speculating that it would generate "continued appeal" for the Wii. 1UP.com's Sam Kennedy called it a "big win" for Nintendo and a significant milestone in the series's history. Joystiq's JC Fletcher called it "explosively hot news", adding jokingly that there is "officially not enough material in the world to make all of the Wiis that are about to be in demand." Soon after the announcement, IGN's Daemon Hatfield wrote an article about the possibilities of a "Dragon Quest X". He commented that it needed to retain the cartoony visuals of "" due to the Wii's difficulty in creating quality realistic visuals. He also hoped that "Dragon Quest X" would feature an open-ended story, as well as features introduced in "Dragon Quest IX", including co-op multiplayer and character customization.
Development.
Game director Jin Fujisawa did not want the game's subscription service to prevent people from experiencing the game, and this lead to periods of free game access called "Kid's time".
Wii U version.
In early March 2013, a beta of the Wii U version of the game began in preparation for a March 30, 2013 Japanese release, featuring enhanced graphics, a partially orchestrated score, and support of the Wii U Gamepad.
Related media.
Music.
Koichi Sugiyama has composed the music to all of the "Dragon Quest" games, including "Dragon Quest X", and a "Symphonic Suite" album with live arrangements and suites made from the game's music.
Manga.
Game has a side-story manga series "Dragon Quest: Sōten no Soura" (ドラゴンクエスト_蒼天のソウラ), which is created by Yuuki Nakashima and still serialized by "V-Jump" from February 2013.
Reception.
Sales and subscriptions.
"Dragon Quest X" sold 420,311 copies its first week in Japan, low for a "Dragon Quest" game but well for an MMORPG. It was the tenth best selling game of 2012 in Japan, selling over 609,783 copies. In November 2012, "Dragon Quest X" exceeded 400,000 subscribers. In its first week on sale, the Wii U version of the game sold 33,302 copies, coming in as the number 6 best selling game of that period.
The 2nd version "Dragon Quest X: Nemureru Yūsha to Michibiki no Meiyū Online" has been sold 117,000 copies for Wii and 71,000 copies for Wii U.
Critical reaction.
"Dragon Quest X" has received positive reviews. The popular Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave "Dragon Quest X" a 36/40. One of the reviewers noted "It's a very well-made package; from the warmly familiar world to the story that has a tendency to wrap you up in it. It's all very "Dragon Quest"-like -- although it feels like leveling takes more time compared to the offline DQs, or at least requires a lot more effort. Still, it's very kind to people who aren't familiar with online RPGs, and the whole thing's designed to make it as fun and accessible as possible to work with other players and go off on adventures."
Legacy.
The game has spawned a written adaptation and related merchandise. The game was adapted into a manga comic in "V-Jump Magazine" by Yuuki Nakashima in December 2012. To promote the game, Nissan created seven "Dragon Quest" branded Nissan Serenas and had a contest for someone to win one.

Turnover on downs

In American football, a turnover on downs occurs when a team fails to convert a fourth down into a first down by gaining the required yardage.
A team has four chances (each chance is called a "down") to gain ten yards or to score. Any ground gained during one down short of these ten yards is kept for the next chance. Thus, if a team gains four yards on first down, it then has three chances to gain the six remaining yards. If a team gains the required ten yards, it receives another four downs to gain another ten yards (an event called a "first down") or cross the goal line for a score.
Though teams have four chances, in most cases, only three are used. Usually, if a team fails to gain the needed yardage after the third down, it will then punt the ball, offering the opposing team possession (the kicking team aims to place the ball downfield), or attempt to kick a field goal if close enough. The opposing team will start their new set of downs at the spot the punt returner can advance the ball to before being tackled (or going out of bounds), or where the punt comes to rest when rolling to a stop (or where it goes out of bounds), or at the spot where the ball is fair-caught.
But in some instances, a team may elect to use its fourth down to try to gain the yardage, rather than punt. This is often referred to as "going for it" or "sticking" (as opposed to "kicking"). This disadvantage is that if the fourth-down conversion attempt fails, the opposing team will immediately take possession of the ball at the spot where the play ended, rather than (usually) much farther away from a score in the case of a punt. Factors that may lead to a team making this choice are:

Diademichthys lineatus

Diademichthys lineatus, known commonly as the Long-snout clingfish or Urchin clingfish, is a species of marine fish in the family Gobiesocidae.
Distribution & habitat.
Long-snout clingfish is widespread throughout the tropical waters of the Indo-West Pacific region from the Gulf of Oman to Papua New Guinea.
It is found in reef environments often associated with long-spined sea urchins particularly of the genus "Diadema".
Description.
Long-snout clingfish is a small size fish, it grows up to .
Its body is elongated with a stretched and spatulate snout.
The latter is a criteria for recognizing the sex of the fish, females have a longer and finer snout than males. This sexual dimorphism create a different diet between the two sex.
The body background colour varies from dark brown to red-brown, three yellowish longitudinal lines runs along the body, one on the top and the two others on the median axis of the sides of the fish. The caudal fin is marked in its centre by a yellow spot, the snout can also have some yellow.
Alimentation.
Long-snout clingfish feeds mainly on burrowing bivalves in corals, tube feet of their host and eggs of a commensal shrimp.
The sexual dimorphism induce a difference between male and female diet, so the adult female, having a longer snout, eats more often small bivalves and shrimp's eggs than the adult male, which eat more frequently tube feet.

St. Luke's Episcopal Church (Beacon, New York)

St. Luke's Episcopal Church is located in Beacon, New York, United States. The church complex of four buildings and a cemetery takes up a parcel between Wolcott (NY 9D), Rector, Phillips and Union Streets. It was founded in 1832 as a religious school that soon became St. Anna's Church of Fishkill Landing.
The church and rectory were built in 1869 from a design by Frederick Clarke Withers, who later on considered the former one of his best buildings. The Gothic Revival-styled building strongly reflects contemporary Ecclesiological theories of appropriate church architecture. Despite some modifications and restoration, the buildings and grounds have remained largely as they were when first built. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008 as "St. Luke's Episcopal Church Complex".
Church complex.
Withers' original design included the church and its rectory, on the corner of Wolcott and Rector. A Parish House was added near the end of the 19th century. It was added to, and a garage built, in the mid-20th. The church buildings and cemetery were laid out by Henry Winthrop Sargent.
Church.
St. Luke's is a one-and-half-story asymmetrical cruciform building faced in Schenectady bluestone in an ashlar pattern with Ohio sandstone trim. It is over a hundred feet (30 m) in length and 60 feet (20 m) wide. Two porches extend from the south profile, a main entrance in the middle of the nave and a secondary one in the transept. There is another porch, pent-roofed, on the north transept. An organ and robing room is attached to the north side of the chancel.
The gabled roof is covered in a variety of materials, mostly cement-asbestos shingles, with some areas of slate and metal. A frame bell cote topped with cast iron cross rises from the west end. The roofline is further pierced by a stone chimney on the north transept and several English Decorated Gothic stone crosses at junctions on the east end. All windows are either lancet or round-arched, with some having additional trefoils. The stained glass was done by Louis Comfort Tiffany's firm and the British glaziers Bell & Almond. Above the main entrance is a bronze lamp with a stone medallion of a bull, the symbol of St. Luke.
The interior walls are plaster applied over an interior brick face, with vertical beadboard and molded chair rail complemented by a similar cornice at the joint between the walls and ceiling. The slip pews are made of oak with tre- and quatrefoil carvings at the ends. The floors in the center and side aisles are laid in a polychrome glass pattern, with carpet covering the area under the pews. There is a brass dedication plaque on the west wall.
Open stained pine trusses spring from corbels along the walls frame the ceiling. They are complemented by sandstone at the arches between the building sections and surrounding the windows and doors. The nave is lit by hanging lamps. In the chancel the bishop's throne, sedilia, prayer desk and stalls are all oak like the pews. The font is of Aubigny stone on a sandstone shaft.
Below the church is its basement. It remains largely unfinished, as it was when the church was built, and unused.
Rectory.
The rectory was part of Withers' original design, and built along with the church. It is a likewise asymmetrical two-and-a-half-story structure of bluestone walls with brick trim, rebuilt to its original plan after a fire. The south-facing front features a gable and tower; the east elevation has a double gable. The west elevation has a single gabled dormer window with half-timbering. The roof is shingled in asphalt.
Inside, the house's decor reflects later Victorian stylings, due to the era in which it was rebuilt. The walls are plaster on lath; the floorboards are thin oak. The woodwork, particularly the mantels, use Eastlake decorative motifs. In the hallway next to the main staircase is the church's safe. The basement is, like the church's, unfinished.
Other outbuildings.
The Parish House on Rector Street is a Romanesque Revival building with a large modern frame addition. A fireplace within it retains a cast-iron decorative plate from the rectory at the church's earlier location in downtown Beacon. Due to the additions, it is not considered a contributing property to the church's overall historic character.
The only other building on the property is the garage. It is a modern structure made of concrete blocks, and is also a non-contributing resource.
Cemetery and landscaping.
While it is level at the southeast corner where the church buildings are, the grounds become gently undulating to the north. Sargent planted specimen trees along the edges, many of which survive. They mostly follow an irregular pattern, except for those that border a path to the church's north porch. The gravestones date from the mid-19th century to the present and include a variety of styles of funerary art. Two notable examples are a brownstone marker with a crocketed pinnacle whose date and decedent cannot be determined, and the Neoclassical monument of Isaac Van Nostrand, with a base, plinth and fluted Roman Doric column.
Aesthetics.
Sargent and Withers were both devout Episcopalians, and followers of the contemporary Ecclesiological movement in church design that advocated the Gothic Revival style of rural English parish churches, similar to the work of A.W. Pugin, as the best form for an Anglican or Episcopal church. Withers, already having been exposed to this in his native England, had professed his allegiance to Ecclesiological principles in an 1858 essay, "A Few Hints on Church Building". His brief work with Andrew Jackson Downing and fellow English immigrant Calvert Vaux prior to the former's death had further strengthened his appreciation for the Picturesque mode of the Gothic Revival
Withers' design strongly reflects Downing's ideals of church design, of a building that harmonizes with the surrounding natural landscape. Several features, such as the broad nave, full transept, deep chancel, large south porch and frame bell cote, are exactly as prescribed by Ecclesiological writers. He involved himself in many of the church's minor details, even designing the altar cloth himself. In his 1873 book "Church Architecture", he devoted a great deal of text and an illustration to St. Luke's, suggesting he was very proud of how it turned out.
The Rectory likewise reflects Withers' less conservative visions of domestic architecture on a smaller scale than his usual work, with its irregular and asymmetrical roofline and alternation of brick and stone. Its original tower, destroyed and not rebuilt after a later fire, enhanced its Gothic qualities with a steeply pitched roof.
Sargent's landscape was one of the rare times he and Withers worked together on a property. Its most notable Picturesque feature is the irregular placement of its trees apart from those that border the path from the church and the streets surrounding the plot.
History.
Since before the Revolution Fishkill's Trinity Church had been the only Episcopal house of worship in southeastern Dutchess County. It was not easily accessible to residents of the hamlets of Matteawan and Fishkill Landing, today's Beacon. So, in 1832, three local sisters began offering religious instruction to children at their house, today's Madam Brett Homestead. Their parents and other adults met in a dry goods store, and by the end of the year the group had reached the size where it could form a parish of its own. In 1833 it formally incorporated as St. Anna's, and the next year built a small brick church with columned portico at what is now the intersection of Main Street and Tioronda Avenue on donated land.
In the following decades, Tioronda became the railroad's right-of-way, making it a less desirable location. The church became neglected in turn. So the congregation decided in 1863 to build a new church elsewhere. One congregant, Charles Wolcott, gave six acres next to the church's then-cemetery. In 1866 he added the adjacent land of equal size then used as a cemetery by a local Presbyterian church.
The deed stipulated that a religious edifice of at least $20,000 in value ($ inflation adjusted 1866 value) had to be built on the property within three years of its conveyance to the church. To raise the money, the church sold both its old church and rectory.
Withers, who had already built the Reformed Dutch Church of Fishkill Landing in the future city and the Eustatia home of John Monell, one of St. Anna's vestrymen, was easily recruited to design the new church and rectory due to his devout Episcopalianism and relationships with members of the church. Sargent was, at the time of St. Luke's construction, also a vestryman.
Ground was broken in 1868, and the church officially became St. Luke's Church of Matteawan and the first service was held the following year. The other buildings included the rectory and a small frame schoolhouse where the Parish House now stands. The total construction cost came to $60,000 ($ in 2008 dollars). This debt took a while to retire, and as a result the church was not formally consecrated until 1879.
In 1887, fire severely damaged the rectory. The outside was salvaged, but the interior had to be rebuilt. The original floor plan was recreated, but some more contemporary decor was added.
Five years later, in 1892, the church decided to demolish the original schoolhouse and replace it with the Parish House. The building was supposed to be cross-shaped, but that design could not be completed as there was not enough money to complete its construction. The addition of the Great Hall in the 1950s finally completed the original design. During that period, the church building itself also got a new heating system, carpet for the floor under the pews, and the current roof tiles.
The church today.
Per its roots, St. Luke's maintains an active youth ministry and choir. It also hosts a local Alcoholics Anonymous chapter, and is a charter sponsor of a local Boy Scout troop. The church also has strong ties to The Children's Villa, a home for orphaned and abandoned children in Amistad, Bolivia.

Cooma Cottage

Cooma Cottage is one of the oldest surviving rural houses in Yass, New South Wales. It has historic significance as a relatively intact complex of rural buildings. It has a variety of significant natural and built elements, including an example of an early tree called the Picconia, a relative of the olive and rare in Australia, which is almost extinct in its native Canary Islands.
Cooma Cottage stands as evidence of what the first settlers built for themselves, their families and servants. The handmade bricks and crafted woodwork are the result of local skills and manufacturing.
The cottage has important heritage values as the home of Hamilton Hume for more than 30 years from 1839, after he ended his travels and became a grazier. It is a valuable part of the early development of the merino wool industry in Australia.
Architecture.
The original section of the cottage is among the earliest remaining rural homesteads in New South Wales. To this colonial bungalow Hume added his own version of Palladian style wings and a Greek revival portico. The immediate landscape is virtually unchanged since the 19th century although fast-developing Yass spreads nearby and busy roads have started to intrude.
State Heritage Listing.
Cooma Cottage was given a heritage listing in the NSW State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002. The features noted were that the house demonstrates a form, which has grown from a bungalow through a series of additions -idiosyncratic, apparently haphazard, or sophisticated - to be fully united in Palladian form. The variety and juxtaposition of building techniques and materials is exceptional. The house remains within its original unspoilt historic curtilage and retains visual links, and is integral with the adjacent landscape and early properties.

Tong De Medical College (Chinese:同德医学院) (1918-1952), in Shanghai, China, was one of the three medical schools merged to establish Shanghai Second Medical College in 1952. The other two were Medical School of Aurora University and Medical School of St. John's University.
History.
Tong De Medical College was established by the Chinese-German Medical Association, founded in 1916 by graduates of Tongji German Medical College (Chinese:同济德文医学堂), the former name of Tongji University. In 1917, Mr. Shen Yunfei (Chinese:沈云扉), a member of the association, became the director of Nantong Medical School. In 1918, Mr. Shen resigned from that position and came back to Shanghai. As 10 students followed him, Mr. Shen tried to help them finish their study. He pushed to open a medical school. 
With the support of the association, a 10-people committee was established to prepare the school and raise money. They rented No.19 Markham Road (now Huai'an Road) as the school building, and were named Tong De Medical School. Mr. Jiang Fengzhi was elected as the master and Mr. Shen Yunfei was chosen as the director of educational administration. The school was opened on September 16, 1918. They recruited 36 students for the five-year program. There were 16 teachers, 12 of them were the alumni of Tongji German Medical College, most of them were volunteers. It was the start of Tong De Medical College.

Turbo-Union

Turbo-Union Limited is a joint venture between three European aero-engine manufacturers, FiatAvio (now Avio), MTU Aero Engines and Rolls-Royce.
Products.
The company's only product is the RB199, a three-spool turbofan developed specifically for the Panavia Tornado.
Structure.
The ownership of the company similarly split into-
It had an office on "Arabellastraße" in Munich near both NAMMA and Panavia, but the head office was initially at Filton. It was known as Rolls-Royce Turbo-Union Ltd. Turbo-Union was a fully integrated and collaborative European Company, whose formal language was English, by kind and charitable agreement of the Governments concerned. The organisation of the company was of FG (Functional Group) kind - for example, FG4 was Concept Design Engineering, FG6 was Customer Support Engineering and Provisioning, and so on. Each FG was chaired by a European person included people from all three companies as required. The FG also had subgroups - for example, FG4-4 was Development, FG6-2 was FTC (Flight Test Centre) support.
The company is now based at the home of Rolls-Royce in Derby, but also has an office at the Panavia head office in Germany.
Production sites.
Turbo Union as a whole designed and produced the engine, albeit the GA (General Arrangement) drawing was assembled at Bristol (Filton) from all three partners inputs. Over 2000 engines were built up to and including the 1990s, from components sourced in all three countries in approximate proportion to their Governmental support. The RAF had engines assembled and supported from Bristol, the German Air Force and Navy from Munich, and the Italian Air Force from Turin (Torino).
History.
When it was formed in October 1969 it was claimed to be the largest aero-engine consortium in the world. The RB199 would be Europe's biggest ever military engine programme, and was based at Filton.
Development of the Rolls-Royce RB199 started in September 1969, prior to the formation of Turbo-Union.
The first RB199 engine ran in September 1971, with the first flight in a Tornado in August 1974. The engines are all FADEC controlled with slightly different engine versions for each Tornado variant. The French took no part in the European project, not least because it was a direct competitor of the Snecma M53 engine. However later in the 1980s, the French joined MTU Turbomeca Rolls-Royce to build the MTR MTR390 helicopter engine.
In 1983, a Swiss organisation, the Arbeitsgruppe für Luft und Raumfahrt (ALR) based in Zurich, proposed an aircraft called the Piranha 6 powered by a single RB199.
The first prototype Eurofighter planes used the RB199 engine, until in June 1995 when the first EJ200-engined plane took off from Turin. Its predecessor, the British Aerospace EAP, also used the engines.
Management.
The first Chairman was Hugh Conway, the Managing Director of the Bristol (Filton) plant of Rolls-Royce. Marshal of the Royal Air Force Denis Spotswood was Chairman from 1975-80.
For many years, the designer of the Pegasus engine, Gordon Lewis, was Managing Director. Previous to him was Martin Steinberger of Motoren und Turbinen-Union (MTU - based in Munich). Karlheinz Koch was MD until 2008.

Requinto jarocho

The requinto jarocho or guitarra de son is a plucked string instrument, played usually with a special pick. It is a four- or five-stringed instrument that has originated from Veracruz, Mexico. 
The "requinto" is used in conjunto jarocho ensembles. In the absence of the "arpa", the requinto typically introduces the melodic theme of the "son" and then continues by providing a largely improvised counterpoint to the vocal line.
Characteristics.
The requinto jarocho is shaped like a guitar with a small body. The body, neck and tuning head is made from one piece of wood. It has a shallow body, and a slightly raised fingerboard. It also has 12 frets. 
The four-stringed requinto jarocho can follow the standard tuning of (ADGc), but is also commonly tuned to GADg and CDGc. The five-stringed requinto, however, adds a string above the standard tuning 5 half-steps below the initial first string, making it EADGc.
The requinto jarocho strings are made of nylon; when played it sounds like the bottom four strings of a classical guitar.

Urban open space

In land use planning, urban open space is open space areas for "parks", "green spaces", and other open areas. The landscape of urban open spaces can range from playing fields to highly maintained environments to relatively natural landscapes. They are commonly open to public access, however, urban open spaces may be privately owned. Areas outside of city boundaries, such as state and national parks as well as open space in the countryside, are not considered urban open space. Streets, piazzas, plazas and urban squares are not always defined as urban open space in land use planning.
Scope.
The term "urban open space" can describe many types of open areas. One definition holds that, "As the counterpart of development, urban open space is a natural and cultural resource, synonymous with neither 'unused land' nor 'park and recreation areas." Another is "Open space is land and/or water area with its surface open to the sky, consciously acquired or publicly regulated to serve conservation and urban shaping function in addition to providing recreational opportunities." In almost all instances, the space referred to by the term is, in fact, green space. However, there are examples of urban green space which, though not publicly owned/regulated, are still considered urban open space.
From another standpoint public space in general is defined as the meeting or gathering places that exist outside the home and workplace that are generally accessible by members of the public, and which foster resident interaction and opportunities for contact and proximity. This definition implies a higher level of community interaction and places a focus on public involvement rather than public ownership or stewardship.
Ownership.
Generally considered open to the public, urban open spaces are sometimes privately owned. Some examples of such places include higher education campuses, neighborhood/community parks/gardens, and institutional or corporate grounds. These areas still function to provide "aesthetic and psychological relief from urban development". Nevertheless, most commonly the term is used to reference spaces that are public and "green".
Benefits.
The benefits that urban open space provides to citizens can be broken into three basic forms; recreation, ecology, and aesthetic value.
Recreational.
Urban open space is often appreciated for the recreational opportunities it provides. Recreation in urban open space may include active recreation (such as organized sports and individual exercise) or passive recreation, which may simply entail being in the open space. Time spent in an urban open space for recreation offers a reprieve from the urban environment.
Ecological.
The conservation of nature in an urban environment has direct impact on people for another reason as well. A Toronto civic affairs bulletin entitled "Urban Open Space: Luxury or Necessity" makes the claim that "popular awareness of the balance of nature, of natural processes and of man’s place in and effect on nature – i.e., "ecological awareness" – is important. As humans live more and more in man-made surroundings – i.e., cities – he risks harming himself by building and acting in ignorance of natural processes." Beyond this man-nature benefit, urban open spaces also serve as islands of nature, promoting biodiversity and providing a home for natural species in environments that are otherwise uninhabitable due to city development.
In a sense, by having the opportunity to be within a natural urban green space people gain a higher appreciation for the nature around them. As Bill McKibben mentions in his book "The End of Nature", people will only truly understand nature if they are immersed within it. He follows in Henry David Thoreau's footsteps when he isolated himself in the Adirondack Mountains in order to get away from society and the overwhelming ideals it carries. Even there he writes how society and human impact follows him as he sees airplanes buzzing overhead or hears the roar of motorboats in the distance.
Aesthetic.
The aesthetic value of urban open spaces is self-evident. People enjoy viewing nature, especially when it is otherwise extensively deprived, as is the case in urban environments. Therefore, open space offers the value of "substituting gray infrastructure."
One researcher states how attractive neighborhoods contribute to positive attitudes and social norms that encourage walking, while having close access to recreational facilities such as parks increases the likelihood that people will translate walking intentions into actual action. 
Other values of urban open space.
The value of urban open space can also be considered with regards to the specific functions it provides. For example, the Bureau of Municipal Research in Toronto lists these functions as the nature function, urban design function, economic function, social retreat function, and outdoor recreation function. Another study categorizes the values open space offers from a sociological viewpoint, listing: civic and social capital, cultural expression, economic development, education, green infrastructure, public health, recreation, and urban form. These studies reiterate the same core benefits of urban open spaces and none of the options create any inconsistencies with the others.
Additional beneficial aspects of urban open space can be factored into how valuable it is compared to other urban development. One study categorizes these measures of value into six groups: utility, function, contemplative, aesthetic, recreational, and ecological. These categories account for the value an urban open space holds to the development of the city in addition to just those things citizens consciously appreciate. For example, the "function value" of an open space accounts for the advantages an urban open space may provide in controlling runoff. The final three values listed, aesthetic, recreational, and ecological, are essentially the same as the values that make urban open spaces consciously valuable to citizens. Of course, there are several different ways to organize and refer to the merit of open space in urban planning.
A study conducted in Australia provided insight into how there is a correlation between community development/community safety and natural open space within the community. Open areas allow community members to engage in highly social activities and facilitate the expansion of social networks and friendship development. As people become more social they decrease the perceptions of fear and mistrust allowing a sense of community bondage. 
Public health.
Significant research supports the notion that urban open spaces offer health benefits to city residents through exposure to a natural environment.
It has been unambiguously shown that there is a strong association between the enjoyment of nature and the health of a city population in general. Studies have examined several aspects of this association and also specific impacts on distinct demographic groups. Most have been reviewed and listed in a comprehensive analysis by the Health Council of the Netherlands
A large epidemiological study in Britain looked at mortality and morbidity among three income levels in relation to their access to green open space. The study examined about 360,000 deaths in a population of about 41 million. While it confirmed that wealthier individuals were generally healthier than those with lower incomes, it made another remarkable discovery: That all groups irrespective of income showed an improvement in health in proportion to their access to green space and that the differences in health status between income groups, who had equivalent access to progressively more green space, shrank favouring the lowest socio-economic group with the highest morbidity.In simple terms, everyone benefited but the lowest income group benefited the most. (see chart). These striking results based on an exceptionally large sample confirm unambiguously the health-related effects of green space and suggest its importance as an element in neighbourhood layouts. Not only would it reduce health disparities between incomes but it would also promote general health and well-being.
A second epidemiological study in the Netherlands examined the health of 17,000 people in relationship to the presence of green space in their surroundings. It found that residents of neighbourhoods with abundant green space were, on average, healthier. This correlation was clearly evident in the general population but it was more pronounced among seniors, housewives and low-income people. Also significant was the correlation between health and the total amount of green space, which, in some cases, was located at a distance of 1–3 km from home.
A third study took place in Tokyo, which is known for its very high building density. This was a longitudinal study that followed a group of 3,000, 70-year old citizens over five years. The presence of relatively plentiful green space in a neighbourhood correlated with a lower mortality risk. This correlation was stronger in a sub-sample of elderly people with few physical disabilities.
Other research looked at specific demographic groups such as age, occupation, socioeconomic status and unusual health conditions or symptoms. Though these studies vary in their degree of scientific rigour, they all point to the potential benefits of nearby nature. For example:
• Convincing evidence suggests that nature has a positive effect on recovery from stress and attention fatigue. For example, people in highly stressful occupations such as caregivers or hospital nurses can shed much of their stress by being or walking in natural settings. This détente, evidently, can occur even when the exposure to nature is brief. 
• Similarly, evidence shows that nature has a positive impact on mood, concentration, mental fatigue, self-discipline and physiological stress.
• Likewise, results that show faster recovery rates for hospital patients, who have a view of nature through their window, can be attributed to stress reduction, in the absence of other explanatory mechanisms.
• Parents of children suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder, report improvement and fewer attention problems when the area of play is in natural settings
• Green spaces may enhance the potential of creating and sustaining community interaction and networks
A study in Finland found that mental restoration, feelings of vitality and mood are negatively impacted when an individual is located in an urban environment. However, the presence of urban parks (public green spaces) allowed for some beneficial restoration and aided both vitality and creativity. The results of this study pointed to the conclusion that spending time in urban green areas after work has stress-reducing effects and that public parks in urban communities should be easily accessible. 
"Last Child in the Woods" speaks of the positive effects nature in general has on children, even when experienced in small islands of green within a city. Urban open spaces offer citizens relief from the strains of urban environments and everyday demands. That respite can come in the form of a walk or run, time spent sitting or reading, watching the birds, essentially any time spent in the natural environment the open space offers. Research shows that when open spaces are attractive and accessible, people are more likely to engage in physical activity, which has obvious inherent health benefits. Accessibility has been shown to increase open space use, which drops dramatically for distances longer than a five-minute walk (about 400 m). Neighbourhood layouts such as the Oglethorpe Plan for Savannah, GA or the contemporary Fused Grid achieve high degree of accessibility.
Public recreation parks are multi-use, but recent advances in best practices has prompted many cities to move away from old-fashioned and biologically impoverished "urban savannah" designs, to mosaic environments, which allow full recreational use but maintain higher levels of biodiversity and hence deliver greater benefits to human well-being. A recent study in Sheffield, UK, found that the psychological benefits gained by visitors to urban green spaces increased with their biodiversity, indicating that 'green' alone is not sufficient; the quality of that green is important in delivering the health benefits.
Biodiversity and ecosystems of urban open space.
The environment of an urban open space significantly influences how that space is perceived and used. Some green spaces maintain a natural environment with a native and self-sustaining ecosystem. Depending on factors such as the location of the city and the location of the space within the city, this natural open space may be a grassy field, woodland, or something aquatic such as a stream, swamp, pond or lake. Other areas may be more heavily influenced by its purpose and use. Examples of open space that would match this description are playing fields, gardens, or imposed ecosystems. In these instances, the mechanics and engineering of a space (ex. grey water reuse/altered water drainage) may need to be altered in order to accommodate a space. One example is Teardrop Park designed by Landscape Architecture firm Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates. The small space in which the park is located made the reuse or water runoff necessary in order to cut costs and conform to green building standards.
Species of flora and fauna commonly found in urban open space may include species that have adapted to city life as well as species not typical in the conventional urban environment because of significantly different ecosystems that comprise urban open spaces. Species most often able to co-exist with man in an urban setting are usually those that "are able to reproduce rapidly and to take advantage of transitory conditions or to evolve varieties suited to the urban situation". Therefore, larger urban open spaces, especially those with various types of environments, are more likely to support a diverse ecosystem. 
Depending on the type of open space, species may be either exotic and native producing a corresponding ecosystem. Often, large urban open spaces that rely on a natural local ecosystem experience greater success in terms of maintaining a balanced biodiversity, so long as the areas are "established and managed primarily to benefit natural wildlife populations in order that they may function as regional reservoirs."
History.
London.
London has a long history of urban open space, which has significantly influenced development of modern parks, and is still among the greenest capital cities in the world.
The basis for many urban open spaces seen today across Europe and the West began its process of development in London in the 17th and 18th centuries. What would eventually become urban open green space began as paved public plazas. Though they were intended to be open to the public, these spaces began to be re-designated as private parks around the late eighteenth century. It was during this period that the areas became pockets of green in the urban environment, commonly modelled after the natural wild of the countryside.
The first parks to reverse the trend of privatization and again be opened to the public were England’s royal parks in the nineteenth century. This was done in response to the extensive and unexpected population movement from the country into cities. As a result, "the need for open space was socially and politically pressing… The problems, to which the provision of parks was expected to offer some relief, were easy to describe: overcrowding, poverty, squalor, ill-health, lack of morals and morale, and so on". Such sentiments again received significant popular support during the "City Beautiful" movement in America during the 1890s and 1900s. Both trends focused on providing the public an opportunity to receive all of the perceived health and lifestyle benefits of having access to open space within urban environments.
Current trends.
Segmentation of urban open spaces was particularly prominent in America during the twentieth century. Since the late 1800s romantic park systems, open space designers have been concerned with guiding, containing or separating urban growth, distributing recreation, and/or producing scenic amenity, mostly within the framework of geometric abstractions."
Such segmentation was especially prominent in the 1990s, when urban open spaces took a path similar to that of parks, following the modernization trend of segmentation and specialization of areas. As modernity stressed "increased efficiency, quantifiablity, predictability, and control… In concert with the additional social divisions" (Young 1995), open spaces grew more specific in purpose. Perhaps this increase in division of social classes’ use of open space, demonstrated by the segmentation of the spaces, displays a situation similar to the privatization of London parks in the eighteenth century, which displayed a desire to make classes more distinct.
Today, places like Scandinavia, which do not have a significant history of outdoor recreation and gathering places, are seeing a proliferation of urban open spaces and adopting a lifestyle supported by the extra urban breathing room. An example of this can be seen in Copenhagen where an area closed to car traffic in 1962 developed, in just a few decades, a culture of public political gatherings and outdoor cafes emerged. Not only is appreciation for and use of urban open spaces flourishing in locations that historically lacked such traditions, the number of urban open spaces is increasing rapidly as well.
Controversy.
Value.
Properties near urban open space tend to have a higher value. One study was able to demonstrate that, “a pleasant view can lead to a considerable increase in house price, particularly if the house overlooks water (8–10%) or open space (6–12%).” When it comes to proximity to the park edge, while there is a premium attached to apartments in close vicinity to the park, a negative premium is attached to this attribute for single-family houses, which may be due to the potential negative externalities that may surround parks, particularly in the evenings.
Access.
Urban open space is under strong pressure. Due to increasing urbanization, combined with a spatial planning policy of densification, more people face the prospect of living in less green residential environments, especially people from low economic strata. This may lead to environmental inequality with regard to the distribution of (access) to public green space.
One study, which compared public open spaces between high socioeconomic neighborhoods and low socioeconomic neighborhoods, found that urban open space in the highest socioeconomic neighborhoods had more amenities (e.g. picnic tables, drink fountains and toilets) than open spaces in lower socioeconomic neighborhoods. Urban open spaces in higher socioeconomic neighborhoods were more likely to have trees that provided shade, a water feature (e.g. pond, lake and creek), walking and cycling paths, lighting, signage regarding dog access and signage restricting other activities as well.

The Holy War

The Holy War Made by King Shaddai Upon Diabolus, to Regain the Metropolis of the World, Or, The Losing and Taking Again of the Town of Mansoul is a 1682 novel by John Bunyan. This novel, written in the form of an allegory, tells the story of the town "Mansoul". Though this town is perfect and bears the image of Shaddai (Almighty), it is deceived to rebel and throw off his gracious rule, replacing it instead with the rule of Diabolus. Though Mansoul has rejected the Kingship of Shaddai, he sends his son Emmanuel to reclaim it.
Now there were three esteemed men, who, by admitting Diabolus to the city, lost their previous authority. The eyes of "Understanding", the mayor, are hidden from the light. "Conscience", the recorder, has become a madman, at times sinning, and at other times condemning the sin of the city. But worst of all is Lord Willbewill, whose desire has been completely changed from serving his true Lord, to serving Diabolus. With the fall of these three, for Mansoul to turn back to Shaddai of their own will, is impossible. Salvation can come only by the victory of Emmanuel.
The entire story is a masterpiece of Christian literature, describing vividly the process of the fall, conversion, fellowship with Emmanuel, and many more intricate doctrines.

Viborg Katedralskole

Viborg Katedralskole is a public gymnasium (secondary education school) in Viborg, Denmark. The school is located at Gammel Skivevej 2 in Viborg and supports about 1000 students.
History.
The Katedralskole was established around 1060 as a Catholic seminary. Young men were schooled in Bible reading, hymn singing, prayers and Latin. The school's rector was appointed by the bishop and simultaneously served as a priest in one of Viborg's twelve local churches.
After the Protestant Reformation in 1536, the school became regulated by the Danish monarchy. In 1772 the school moved to Sct. Mogens Gade 1, while the original structure was rebuilt to hold an increased number of students and teachers. The school was later landscaped with a garden as a result of a fire in the area around the school. The garden is known as the "Latin Garden". The old school and the Latin Garden lie near Viborg Cathedral.
The 1800s saw a series of school reforms: a library was established and subjects were taught in Danish. In 1903 a national law in Denmark was introduced that allowed girls admittance to gymnasiums, and in 1904 Katedralskole became coeducational. 
The architect Hack Kampmann started work in 1922 on an additional school building. Kampmann died before the building was completed, so his son, architect Christian Kampmann, completed the project in 1926. The school, which is preserved, now lies on the corner of Skivevej and Aalborgvej. 
The exterior of the present school building is constructed in the Neoclassical style with a Scandinavian modern interior. In the beginning of 2007, a large room was added in the former loft, providing more space for group work. The room has been given the name "Kampmann Hall" after the school's architect.

Canarian Houbara

The Canarian Houbara, "Chlamydotis undulata fuertaventurae", is a large bird in the bustard family. It is a Houbara Bustard subspecies which is endemic to the eastern Canary archipelago, in Macaronesia in the North Atlantic Ocean, where it is a scarce and threatened non-migratory resident.
Taxonomy.
The Canarian Houbara is one of three subspecies of the Houbara Bustard. Archaeological evidence indicates that it has been present in the Canary Islands for 130-170,000 years. However, genetic data point to a more recent separation of "C. u. fuertaventurae" from the nominate subspecies around 20-25,000 years ago. It suggests that there was an initial colonisation of the Canary Islands about 130,000 years ago, followed by a second colonisation 19-30 000 years ago, with subsequent isolation until today.
Description.
The Canarian Houbara is distinguished from the other two subspecies by its smaller size, less sandy colouring, and darker and more extensive markings on the back. It is the largest bird native to the Canary Islands.
Distribution and habitat.
Houbaras are restricted to the islands of Fuerteventura, Lobos, Lanzarote and Graciosa, though it is uncertain as to whether they continue to exist on Lobos. Annual rainfall in their range is less than 140 mm while mean monthly temperatures range between 16°C in January-February and 24°C in August-September. They inhabit semi-arid plains, rocky hills and immobile dunes, sparsely vegetated with bushes and grasses. They will sometimes feed in farmland in the early morning and at dusk, but avoid human settlements, cornfields, forests and lava flows.
Behaviour.
Breeding.
Outside the breeding season the birds may be gregarious and forage in small parties. However, when breeding, males hold and defend individual territories for courtship display some 500-1000 m across. During this period both sexes tend to be solitary, only coming together for mating. Courtship takes place from December to March with the male displaying his head and throat plumage while strutting in a line or circle. The female lays two or three eggs in a scrape on the ground between February and April. Males are probably polygynous and do not help to rear the young. The chicks are nidifugous and accompany the female after hatching. Usually only one chick survives from each clutch, rarely two.
Feeding.
The birds are omnivorous, feeding on the ground and consuming a variety of arthropods, molluscs and small vertebrates as well as plant material. The chicks require insects in order to grow properly.
Status and conservation.
The Action Plan published in 1995 estimated the total population of Canarian Houbaras at about 700–750 birds, comprising 300–350 on Fuerteventura and Lobos, and 400 on Lanzarote and Graciosa. However a later study estimated the number of birds on Fuerteventura at 177. Although they are classified as endangered on the Spanish Bird Red List, and are protected by legislation, they are threatened by several factors, including habitat destruction from development, increased disturbance from tourism, illegal hunting, collisions with powerlines and disturbance by truffle collectors.

Pirog

Pirog or pyrih (, pl. "pirogi" пироги; ; ; , pl. "pyrohy" пироги) is a pie that can have either a sweet or savoury filling. The name is derived from the ancient Proto-Slavic word "pir", meaning "banquet" or "festivity". Pirogi or pyrohy are full-sized pies, while "pirozhki" () or "pyrizhky" () are individual-sized buns that can be eaten with one hand.
Shape.
The standard shape for pirogi is oblong with tapering ends, but circular or rectangular pirogi are also common. They can be closed or open-faced with no crust on top (like a tart). In Sweden thay can be triangular.
Pastry.
Pirog is usually made from yeast-raised dough, but can also be made from shortcrust or puff pastry.
Filling.
The filling for pirogi may be sweet and contain quark or cottage cheese, fruits like apples, plums or various berries, as well as honey, nuts or poppy seeds. Savoury versions may consist of meat, fish, mushrooms, cabbage, rice, buckwheat groats or potato. In Ukrainian and Russian cuisines, pyrohy with a savoury filling are traditionally served (like pirozhki) as an accompaniment with clear borscht, broth or consommé.

NYPD subway sodomy incident

The NYPD subway sodomy incident refers to the circumstances surrounding the October 15, 2008, arrest of Michael Mineo by New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers. According to Mineo, the arresting police officers pinned him to the ground, while Richard Kern, one of the officers, pulled down Mineo's pants and sodomized him with a police baton. On December 9, 2008, the Brooklyn District Attorney indicted the three arresting officers and charged them with felonies. Richard Kern was charged with aggravated sexual abuse in the first degree, assault in the first degree, and hindering prosecution. Two other officers, Andrew Morales and Alex Cruz, were charged with hindering prosecution and official misconduct. All three officers were tried and found not guilty of all charges.
Background.
Michael Mineo.
Michael Mineo was born c.1984 in either the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York or in Dallas, Texas. He is Italian-Puerto Rican. Both of his parents died of drug overdoses when he was around eleven years old. He then moved in with his mother's parents, but they both died by the time he was fourteen. He then moved in with an aunt by marriage and her husband who lived in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Mineo was under indictment on felony assault charges stemming from an unrelated incident for which he was arrested on April 18, 2008. Mineo's defense for his indictment was a legal aid attorney, but following the alleged incident on October 15 he hired a private attorney. In the fall of 2003, Mineo stole his friend's mother's credit cards and placed more than $6,000 on the card. During that time, he left for New York City; soon thereafter he was arrested on marijuana possession and was found to be carrying the stolen credit cards.
Richard Kern.
In 2007, New York City paid out $50,000 to settle two excessive force lawsuits filed against Richard Kern. However, the Civilian Complaint Review Board cleared him of wrongdoing and Kern says the excessive force claims were a "complete lie".
Incident.
On October 15, 2008, Michael Mineo was allegedly smoking a marijuana joint outside the BMT Brighton Line's Prospect Park station, located in the Lefferts Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. When approached by police officers, Mineo ran into the train station, jumped the turnstile, but was caught and handcuffed near the token booth. According to the officers, they found no drugs on him, issued him a summons for disorderly conduct, and let him go. According to Mineo, after he was handcuffed and pinned down, Richard Kern pulled down his pants and shoved a police radio antenna into his anus. Mineo later changed his version to a police baton. On October 23, Mineo's attorneys announced the incident and noted that they planned to file a lawsuit against New York City on Mineo's behalf.
Speaking before a grand jury in November 2008, Transit Police officer Kevin Maloney testified that police officer Richard Kern jabbed Mineo's buttocks with a police baton, while other witnesses testified that Mineo's bare buttocks were visible and that they heard him screaming: "Don't shove a walkie up my a--!" Mineo later praised the Transit Police officer who had testified on his behalf stating "I'm really happy he came out and said what he said. He must have felt bad." Maloney, 26, testified that he saw Kern, 25 resting his baton on Mineo's left buttock, and he saw half inch to an inch disappear from view. Michael Mineo was hospitalized two times with what sources described as "rectal tears" as a result of the assault.
Parallels to Abner Louima.
This case has drawn parallels to a similar set of circumstances that took place in August 1997, in which NYPD officers assaulted and forcibly sodomized Abner Louima with a broken plunger handle after he was arrested. However, there are differences between the Louima and Mineo situations. Louima was black and his 1997 police attackers were white, whereas Mineo is described as white and Hispanic and the involved police officers are white, black and Hispanic.
Criticism of NYPD.
The NYPD was criticized for not taking Mineo's claims seriously. The accused officers were kept on regular patrol duty for two and half weeks after the incident. The police maintain that they aggressively located records, reviewed hours of videotape, examined MetroCard records, and retained equipment for DNA testing.
Trial.
The trial of the three police officers began on January 22, 2010. The prosecution called Mineo, another police officer who witnessed the incident, a doctor who treated Mineo, and a DNA expert from the medical examiner's office. The defense followed by calling each of the three officers, and a doctor who stated the injuries were not consistent with assault. The defense submitted a video as evidence that supports the argument that Mineo had a pre-existing medical condition. During the jury deliberations, one juror was removed because she misinformed the other jurors regarding past allegations against Kern. The removed juror was replaced with an alternate. After a couple of days of deliberating, the jury found the three police officers not guilty. The jury stated to the judge that they had reasonable doubt regarding the incident.

Form grabbing

Form grabbing is an advanced (crimeware-based) method of capturing Web form data within various browsers. Often confused with traditional keylogging (recording individual keystrokes), this method intercepts the on submit API in browsers and collects web form data before it passes over the Internet. Other methods of form grabbing function similarly using a Web browser add-on or malicious toolbar to automatically read the information in log in forms when the client submits it. This type of method is very effective in recording online banking passwords and other sensitive data because it only records log in, password, IP address, URL and other form fields based on what the attacker specifies. This is a growing type of computer-based security attack.
Form grabbing was invented in 2010 with the Berbew Trojan believed to be created by VisualComplex.

China Railways CRH5

The China Railways CRH5 is an electric multiple unit high-speed train in use with China Railway High-speed in the People's Republic of China. The CRH5 is based on the ETR-600 New Pendolino used in Italy.
The CRH5 are non-tilting trains, developed for the Chinese Railways and which technology has been transferred to local manufacturers. The CRH5 have a design speed of up to and now operate steadily at .
CRH5A.
In 2004, the Ministry of Railway in China contracted Alstom and CNR Changchun Railway Vehicles to produce 60 sets of the train with a maximum speed of . These trains have been given the designation CRH5A, and are still the only type of the CRH5 trains. 30 additional sets were ordered in 2009 and 20 additional sets were ordered in 2010 to complete the current fleet operating on China's northern and eastern lines. On April 26, 2011, the MOR ordered an additional 30 sets.
As to the initial 60 sets, the first three were manufactured by Alstom's factory in Italy, and the next six were delivered in complete knock down form and assembled by CNR Changchun Railway Vehicle. The remaining 51 sets were built by CNR Changchun through technology transfer from Alstom.
The first train (CRH5-001A) departed from Savigliano port, Italy on December 11, 2006 and arrive at Dalian port on January 28, 2007. The first CRH5A set made by CNR Changchun (CRH5-010A) was delivered in April, 2007.
The CRH5A sets started service from April 18, 2007, the date of the sixth national railway speed-up at the Beijing-Harbin Railway. In the following years, it opened service at the Jinan-Qingdao high speed rail and Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan high speed rail.
Each of the CRH5A set consists of 8 cars. The initial 12 sets (CRH5-001A ～ CRH5-012A) have one first-class seating car (ZY), six second-class seating cars (ZE), and one second-class seating/dining car (ZEC). The subsequent sets have two first-class seating cars (ZY) and six second-class seating cars (ZE).
The CRH5A trains experienced a number of failures in early stages. The failures were attributed to new technologies introduced on CRH5A and a relatively short trial run before the first delivery 
CIT001.
On April 2, 2007, China Academy of Railway Sciences ordered a CRH5 based high-speed test train; the official name of this train set is Code Zero Comprehensive Testing Train, name code CIT001. This train is equipped with special devices to monitor the condition of the track, wheel-rail force, overhead wire, communication system and signal system. The train is painted with yellow and white color and started test run on July 1, 2007.

Garden gnome liberationists

Garden gnome liberationists are individuals and groups advocating the "freedom" of garden gnomes, small decorative ceramic bearded characters, often stealing them and moving them to new locations. The phenomenon and the liberationists have received substantial media coverage and been featured in films, television and local news stories.
Gnomes and garden gnomes.
A gnome is a mythical creature characterized by its small size and subterranean lifestyle. Reports of people claiming to have seen real, living gnomes have surfaced in several countries, with major media outlets carrying stories about purported gnome sightings. Garden gnomes are small ceramic bearded characters (usually male) that are used as decoration in gardens and lawns. The first garden gnomes were made in Gräfenroda, a town known for its ceramics in Thuringia, Germany in the mid-19th century. The garden gnome quickly spread across Germany and into France and England, and wherever gardening was a serious hobby. Currently, there are an estimated 25 million garden gnomes in Germany.
It has been suggested by some scholars that the garden gnome is based on the Greco-Roman fertility god Priapus, whose statue was often found in ancient gardens. According to folklore, garden gnomes were willing to help in the garden at night. When no one is around, the folklore suggests the garden gnomes awaken from their ceramic state and work on the gardens and lawns in which they reside. In these stories they are said to touch plant life with their magic, causing flowers to bloom, leaves to change color, and streams to saturate the soil surrounding the plants.
Garden gnome liberation.
As modern-day garden gnome folklore developed and their popularity increased, the objects became the target of pranks, known collectively as gnoming. Gnoming activity includes the theft of garden gnomes for the alleged purpose of returning the inanimate garden gnomes "to the wild". In 2008, a 53-year-old Frenchman in Brittany was arrested on suspicion of stealing as many as 170 garden gnomes. 
The goal of Gnome Liberation is "to help set gnomes back into their natural environment".
The practice of stealing garden gnomes is also sometimes referred to as "gnome hunting". Some "kidnapped" garden gnomes have been sent on trips around the world (the travelling gnome prank). This variation on "gnoming" was popularized by the motion picture Amélie, in which the main character persuaded her father to follow his dream of touring the world by stealing his garden gnome and having an air hostess friend send pictures of it from all over the world. The traveling gnome theme later became the basis for Travelocity's "Where is my Gnome?" advertising campaign. The travelling gnome has also been used as a recurring Easter egg in the 2004 simulation game "Sim City 4", in which a gnome sprite reveals itself in the game's buildable landmarks. Also, within the continuing "The Sims" titles, most notably in the third variety, gnomes come in different varieties (such as a vampire, or mummy, according to the main occult of the expansion packs) and move or change position daily, much to the amusement or chagrin of the player. And in the 2007 game "", players receive a special achievement award if they carry a garden gnome throughout most of the game, and place it in a rocket which in turn would launch it into space.
In an extension of the prank, several so-called garden gnome liberation organizations have been formed for the stated purpose of freeing the ceramic creatures from forced labor in gardens. Some of the organizations satirically argue that the inanimate gnomes are captured, sold, and kept as slaves, ripped from their Northern Woodland homes, stripped of their freedoms, and forced to tend to the gardens where they are set. Garden gnome liberation groups claim that they strive to protect the "freedoms" of these silent creatures in various ways, ranging from sending petitions to the owners and the government, to stealing and "liberating" them. Liberationists have often repainted the "freed" garden gnomes to make them unidentifiable, and taken them to wooded areas or sanctuaries where liberationists contend they will be "free from a life of miserable solitude."
Garden gnome liberation organizations.
Garden Gnome Liberation Front.
The first and most predominant gnome liberating force is the Garden Gnome Liberation Front (also known as the Front for the Liberation of Garden Gnomes—"le Front pour la Libération des Nains de Jardin "(FLNJ)). The Garden Gnome Liberation Front was introduced to the French public in 1997. Over the course of a year, the Front stole over 150 garden gnomes, contending that garden gnomes deserved the same freedoms with which they were blessed. The leader of that group was charged in absentia with stealing over 150 garden gnomes over a period of several years.
The Front's leader was given a suspended prison sentence and fined for the 150 stolen gnomes.
In 1998, there was another strike that has been attributed to the Garden Gnome Liberation Front. This strike was known as the "mass suicide". In Briey, a small city in eastern France, citizens woke up to find 11 garden gnomes hanging from a bridge with nooses around their necks. A nearby note stated, "When you read these few words we will no longer be part of your selfish world, where we serve merely as pretty decorations."
For two years following the "mass suicide", the Garden Gnome Liberation Front was relatively silent. No major noteworthy acts were recorded until 2000, when a garden show in Paris displayed 2,000 garden gnomes. In a nighttime raid, the Front "liberated" 20 gnomes from the garden show. The Garden Gnome Liberation Front claimed responsibility, demanding that the Garden Gnomes be released into their natural habitat and not be ridiculed as cheap garden decorations.
The Front gained media attention again in 2006, when 80 gnomes were stolen in the central Limousin region of France.
MALAG and the European Gnome Sanctuary.
In Italy, a group has formed, calling themselves Malag (Movimento Autonomo per la Liberazione delle Anime da Giardino). This group is an Italian branch of the Garden Gnome Liberation Front. They have stated as their goal the establishment of a European Gnome Sanctuary in Barga, Italy. The "Barga News" published an article about Malag's efforts, noting the following:"For a number of months gnomes have been moving into a small valley in the Province of Lucca in Tuscany, Italy. ... Most have decided to settle in the town of BARGA, where they have found a sympathetic population known as BARGHIGIANI who are not only prepared to tolerate the gnome way of life but are even prepared to protect it! ... We are proud to announce the first European Gnome Sanctuary here in Barga. ... Life here is protected, no more small garden prisons, no more torture (the strimmer motorized weedeater is a thing of the past here in Barga)."
The "Barga News" has also published photographs of garden gnomes "now living inside the European Gnome Sanctuary", including hundreds found in the city's parks and at the Castle of Barga, as well as others at the town's main council offices and the Teatro di Differenti.
The Illinois State Ultimate Frisbee Team.
Illinois State University's ultimate frisbee team's mascot is a Garden Gnome. The Men's team's mascot is named Stanley, and the Women's team's mascot is named Stella. In keeping with good spirited shenanigans, several other surrounding area colleges but in particular Southern Illinois University's ultimate team, go out of their way to steal their mascot and take unflattering pictures with it. Most gnome-nappings last for a day or less. Typically their mascot is returned before the ISU team leaves for the weekend. However, in the fall of '08 the ISU Women's Team's mascot, Stella, was gnome-napped and not returned for several months. Reports say she may have traveled as far as Arizona. The mascot, perhaps suffering Stockholm syndrome, was gone for such a long time, when she returned she was covered in tattoos, and had a hardcore grass addiction. She has since had her tattoos removed, but can still occasionally be found waist deep in grass, some speculate she never recovered from Flounder's emotional abuse.

Black dog syndrome

Black dog syndrome or big black dog syndrome is a disputed phenomenon in which black dogs are passed over for adoption in favor of lighter-colored animals. Animal shelters often use the term BBD, or big black dog, to describe the type of larger dark-colored mixed-breed said to be typically passed over by adopters.
Theories.
The phenomenon may be due to a number of factors, including fear stigma against certain breed types, and the fact that large, black dogs are often portrayed as aggressive in film and on television.
Some people believe that during the pet adoption process some potential owners associate the color black with evil or misfortune (similar to the common superstition surrounding black cats), and this bias transfers over to their choice of dog. Additionally, many shelters feature photo profiles of their dogs on the shelter website. Because black dogs do not photograph well, lighter-colored dogs have an advantage with potential adopters browsing the site. A study done by the Los Angeles Animal Services challenges some of these claims, saying that a full 28% of adopted dogs are black. However, the bias theory simply asserts that predominantly dark animals take longer to be adopted than their lighter counterparts, and that large dogs take longer to adopt than small ones.
However, appearance in general does play a role in potential adopters' selection of shelter dogs. In a 2011 study by the ASPCA, appearance was the most frequently cited reason for adopters of both puppies (29 percent) and adult dogs (26 percent).
History.
The issue has been gaining media attention since the mid-2000s. Tamara Delaney, an early activist against black dog syndrome, developed a website called Black Pearl Dogs in 2004 specifically to address the issue, both by educating the public about its existing, as well as showcasing individual dogs available for adoption. The website caught on quickly in the sheltering community, and helped lead 
Cats.
Cats are similarly reported to be subject to the same phenomenon, with the added stigma of longstanding superstition and association with witchcraft. Some US cities prohibit adoption of black cats around Halloween “for fear the felines would be used as holiday props or, worse, sacrifices for those who practice witchcraft.”
Scientific studies.
While many shelter workers claim the phenomenon is real, its acceptance is disputed, and quantitative analyses are limited.
Shelter studies.
A 1992 article in the journal "Animal Welfare", found that color was not a major factor in adoptions at a Northern Ireland shelter; black-and-white coats were most prevalent among adopted dogs, followed by yellow, solid black, gold, and black-and-tan coats.
A 1998 study of 1,468 relinquished dogs offered for adoption at a local humane society found having a primarily black coat color was a variable associated with euthanasia, while gold, gray, and white coats colors were significant predictors of succesful adoption.
A 2002 study published in the "Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science" of dog and cat adoption in California animal shelters found pure black coat colors to be negative factors in adoption rates for both dogs and cats.
In 2008 the general manager of the Los Angeles Animal Services department reported that twelve months of data on the intake of 30,046 dogs showed slightly more dogs that were predominantly or all black were adopted than dogs who were not predominantly or all black.
A 2010 PhD thesis analyzing multiple factors found a measurable variance contributing to dogs with primarily black coats being euthanized rather than adopted.
A 2013 study of dogs' length of stay (LOS) at two New York “no-kill” shelters determined that canine coat color had no effect. The study noted that coat color's effect on LOS may be localized, or may not generalize to traditional or other types of shelters.
A Masters thesis analysis of 16,800 dogs at two Pacific Northwest shelters found that black dogs were adopted more quickly than average at both shelters.
A 2013 study of cat adoption rates published in "The Open Veterinary Science Journal" concluded that “Results indicated that black cats, regardless of age or sex, require the longest time to adopt. They are followed by primarily black cats with other colors.”
Studies based on images.
A 1992 article in the journal "Animal Welfare" was conducted on adoptable dog characteristics. Participants in South Belfast were presented with photographs of dogs similar except for one manipulated feature, resulting in a statistically reliable preference for a blonde coat (65%) over a black coat.
A 2012 report in the journal "Society and Animals" on a pair of studies recording participant rankings of pictured dogs of varying attributes along 8 different personality traits did not find a bias against black dogs. In the first study, using four types of poodles (large black, small black, large white, and small white), 795 participants ranked black poodles as more friendly than white poodles. A second study with eight different breeds, including a black Lab, suggested that the personality ratings of participants was based more on stereotypes of breed than on color. It concluded that "in general, with the exception of the golden retriever, black labs were perceived as consistently less dominant and less hostile than other large breeds, contrary to the assumption that large, black dogs are viewed negatively.
A 2013 study published in the journal "Anthrozoos" displayed photographs of a dogs colored either yellow or black, and with floppy ears or pointy ears. It found that “participants rated the yellow dog significantly higher than the black dog on the personality dimensions of Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Emotional Stability.” It also found differences significant difference in ratings based on ear size, indicating “that people attribute different personality characteristics to dogs based solely on physical characteristics of the dog.”
A study presented at the 2013 International Society for Anthrozoology conference that showed participants pictures of cats and dogs of varying colors found white cats were considered the friendliest, orange cats second friendliest, and black cats were considered least friendly. Among dogs, yellow dogs were considered friendliest, brown dogs second friendliest, and black dogs least friendly. Darker pets were similarly judged less adoptable, and black dogs were considered the most aggressive.

Local governance in Kerala

Kerala, is a tiny state in the southernmost part of India. Kerala, with appreciative development indicators comparable to developed countries, has been experimenting with decentralization and participatory local democracy, ultimately aimed at realization of the constitutional goal of establishing genuine "institutions of local self government" since the enactment of Kerala Panchayat Raj Act & The Kerala Municipality Act in the year 1994.
The acts laid the provision of a three tier system of Panchayat for the first time in the village, block and district level in the rural areas and one tier system of urban local government such as Municipality in the less urbanized areas or Municipal Corporation in the more urbanized areas. Local governments were vested with the powers and responsibilities of economic development and social justice in their respective areas.Panchayats and the Municipalities altogether constitute the Local Government System of Kerala state in the Indian federal system [http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/kerala/government-and-politics/panchayats.html].
The framework.
Kerala has 978 Village Panchayats (Grama panchayats), 152 Block Panchayats and 14 District Panchayats; in the urban areas it has 60 Municipalities and 5 Corporations, a total of 1209 Local Self Government Institutions.
The President of the Panchayat Raj Institutions(PRIs) has been declared as the executive authority. The senior most officials of various departments brought under the control of the Panchayat Raj Institutions have been declared as ex-officio Secretaries for that subject. The Panchayats have full administrative control including powers of disciplinary action over its own staff as well as staff transferred to it. To encourage a healthy relationship between officials and elected Members, the Act prescribes a code of conduct that lays down principles of polite behavior, respect for elected authorities, and protection of the freedom of the civil servant to render advice freely and fearlessly. All these features are there in the Kerala Municipality Act as well.
The Kerala Panchayat Raj Act and Kerala Municipalities Act 1994 were thoroughly restructured in 1999 and several innovative features laying strong legal foundation for evolving genuine institutions of Local Self Government were built in.
Grama Sabha.
Kerala has created a fourth tier in the form of Grama Sabhas equated with the electoral constituency of a Village Panchayat All the electors of the Ward are members of the Grama Sabha. It is an attempt to create a new set up for direct democracy - involving the people of the ward. The Grama Sabhas have been given clear rights and responsibilities with absolute powers for identification of beneficiaries, strong advisory powers for prioritizing developmental needs and wide powers of social audit.
Functions of local governments.
The 11th Schedule of the Constitution of India lists out developmental areas where local governments should have a role in planning for economic development and social justice and in the implementation of such plans. Unlike many other States, Kerala State defined the functional areas of the different tiers of local governments so precisely.In infrastructure and management of public institutions, the functional differentiation is sharp and clear, but in productive sectors the functions could not be earmarked clearly for each tier. There is a clear recognition that there is a role-range for local governments as Agent, Adviser, Manager, Partner and Actor - with the objective being to reduce the agency role and expand the autonomous - actor role. The Kerala Act classifies functions as mandatory functions, general functions and sector-wise functions. in its schedules.
Committee System.
All Village and Block Panchayats have three Standing Committees and the District Panchayat five Standing Committees. The Standing Committees are constituted in such a way that every Member of the Panchayat gets a chance to function in one Standing Committee or the other. Each Standing Committee is assigned certain subjects and these Committees are expected to go into the subject areas both at the planning and implementation stage in great detail.
For the purpose of co-ordination, a Steering Committee is constituted consisting of the President and Vice President of the Panchayat and the Chairpersons of Standing Committees. In addition, there are Functional Committees for different subjects which can include experts and practitioners and the Panchayats are free to constitute Sub Committees to assist the Standing Committee or Functional Committee. There is also provision for constitution of Joint Committees with neighbouring Local Governments.
The Role of State Government.
The amended Kerala Panchayat Raj & Municipality Acts drastically reduces the powers of direct governmental control over Panchayat Raj Institutions. While Government can issue general guidelines regarding national and State policies it cannot meddle in day to day affairs or individual decisions. The Government can cancel resolutions of the Panchayat only through a process and in consultation with the Ombudsman or Appellate Tribunal according to the subject matter of the resolution. Similarly a Panchayat can be dissolved directly by government, only if it fails to pass the budget or if majority of its members have resigned. In all other cases a due process has to be followed and the Ombudsman has to be consulted before dissolution takes place. This is a unique feature which does not exist even in Center-State relations.
Independent Oversight Institutions.
To reduce governmental control and foster growth of self-government as envisaged in the Constitution, the Act provides for creation of independent institutions to deal with various aspects of local government functioning. They are listed below:-
Extent of Decentralization.
The extent of decentralization and its nature can be gauged from the following facts:
Present scenario.
In short, most of the responsibilities relating to human and social development have been passed down to local governments. Welfare and poverty reduction are now largely dependent on local governments who also have considerable area of responsibility in the primary sector.
Local infrastructure creation is also largely in the domain of Panchayats and Nagarapalikas.
Critical institutions of public service like hospitals, schools, anganwadis, veterinary institutions, Krishi Bhawans, hostels for Scheduled Castes and Care institutions for different disadvantaged groups have been transferred to local governments on as is where is condition. The responsibility of local governments which are typical of a non-plan nature in respect of these institutions include -
Proposed reforms.
The Second Administrative Reforms Commission, set up on 31 August 2005 to prepare a detailed blue print for revamping the public administration system, suggested measures to achieve a proactive, responsive, accountable, sustainable and efficient administration at all levels of the country in the country, including the local government system, submitted its sixth report exclusively on local governance under the title "Local Governance : An Inspiring Journey into the future" [http://arc.gov.in/]. A brief summary of the report is there in the article
Kerala Grama Panchayat Association.
Kerala has a Grama Panchayath Association, formed under the Kerala Government Order No 85191/pt.sppl.1/66 & R D D on 29 December 1966 as an association of Grama Panchayaths. All Grama Panchayaths are affiliated to the Grama Panchayath Association.
The Kerala Grama Panchayath Association has responsibility in strengthening decentralization process and local governance in Kerala. For the purpose, the association organizes necessary research activities, Studies, action Researches,some study modelsand conduct discussions, seminars, training etc., on issues confronting panchayaths in the state. It as well, collect, archive and propagate worthy best practices of the panchayaths, as well.The email of the association is keralagpassociation@gmail.com [http://keralagramapanchayatassociation.com/index.html]

The Kerala Panchayat Staff Association (KPSA) is the non political voluntary association of the panchayat employees. It is functioning for the betterment of the employees and thus the entire Panchayat Raj Institutions in Kerala.Empowerment of the employees and the Panchayats is the main motto of the organisation.

Plantin (typeface)

Plantin is a transitional serif typeface named after the printer Christophe Plantin. It was first cut in 1913 under the direction of Frank Hinman Pierpont for the Monotype Corporation, and is based on a Gros Cicero face cut in the 16th century by Robert Granjon. Plantin is one of the typefaces that influenced the creation of Times New Roman in the 1930s.
The intention behind the design of Plantin was to create a font with thicker letterforms than had typically been used until that time: previous type designers had reduced the weight of their fonts to make up for the effect of ink spread, but by 1913 innovations in smoothing and coating paper had led to reduced ink spread.
Pierpont was inspired to use Granjon's designs by a visit to the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp, Belgium, which had them on display. The Granjon font on which Pierpont's design was based was listed as one of the types used by the Plantin-Moretus Press beginning in the 17th century, long after Plantin had died and his press had been inherited by the Moretus family, but Plantin himself had used a few letters of the font to supplement another font, a Garamond. The design for Plantin preserved the large x-height of Granjon's designs, but shortened the ascenders and descenders and enlarged the counters of the lowercase letters a and e.
During the interwar period the face was adopted and popularized by Francis Meynell's Pelican Press and by C. W. Hobson's Cloister press, and also used occasionally by Cambridge Press.
In more recent usage, the magazine "Monocle" is set entirely in Plantin and Helvetica. An infant variety of the typeface also exists, with single-story versions of the letters "a" and "g".

M34 cluster bomb

The M34 cluster bomb was the first mass-produced United States Army weapon meant to deliver the chemical agent sarin (GB). A large stockpile of M34s was destroyed between 1973 and 1976.
History.
As the United States Army Chemical Corps focused its efforts on the weaponization of sarin nerve agent (GB) during the 1950s the M34 cluster bomb was the first such weapon mass-produced by the Army. The weapon was the United States' first major nerve agent weapon after World War II.
Specifications.
The M34 had a diameter of and a length of . This particular cluster bomb was designed to carry a total weight of of sarin nerve agent, the weapon's total weight was . The M34 cluster bomb held 76 M125 bomblet sub-munitions, each of the sub-munitions held of GB. The weapons also contained a parachute, an opening delay, fuze, and a burster which held of tetryl.
Storage and disposal programs.
When Operation Cut Holes and Sink 'Em (CHASE) was cancelled the Army had to scrap a plan to dump more than 20,000 M34 cluster bombs at sea. In 1972 there were still more than 21,000 M34 cluster munitions stored at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, near Denver, Colorado. Between 1973 and 1976 the Army began destroying these munitions under the auspices of Project Eagle. To dispose of the munitions the Army drained the Sarin from the bomblets, mixed it with a caustic inside a reactor chamber, and spray-dried the brine. Project Eagle resulted in the demilitarization and destruction of about of Sarin and of the spray-dried salt. The salt was stored in 18,000 steel and fiberboard drums and placed in a toxic storage site at Rocky Mountain Arsenal.

Wilderich of Walderdorf

Philipp Franz Wilderich Nepomuk (2 March 1739 – 21 April 1810) was count of Walderdorf and the last prince-bishop of Speyer. 
His reign was short, from 1797 until the secularization in 1803. In was unusual that during the secularization, Wilderich was able to live in the south wing of his official residence, the baroque palace in Bruchsal, until his death in 1810. When he was inaugurated in his office, there were already signs indicating that the dissolution of the old empire was at hand. On 22 April 1797, the Domdechant of Trier Walderich was installed as lord bishop of Speyer. 
Wilderich left few physical traces of construction in the Bruchsal palace. It was the little room north of the Fürstensaal, which the newly appointed bishop immediately arranged for his regency. The stuccoers had to use all their imagination and Walderich did not exactly make it easy for them. It was less the artistic design of space as much as the willfullness of the presentation, which Wilderich demanded. More so it was with the furniture with which they had to decorate the room.
At the beginning of the year 1799, the French came across the Rhine. In the Treaty of Lunéville Napoleon had initiated the secularization. The Peace of Luneville was confirmed by the Reichstag of Emperor Franz on 9 February 1801. Prince-bishop Wilderich had to flee. Yet he returned on 10 June 1801 to his seat. Then a "Deputation" used to implement the terms of the accord as agreed. Above all, it was the dissolution of the ecclisiastical offices that had to be implemented. The episcopal holdings, the cathedral chapter and secular holdings, were given to the newly created Principality of Bruchsal, now part of Baden. The principality took over secular control on 1 December 1802 and began to create an administration. The Bruchsal palace became the property of Baden. Prince-bishop Walderich retained his princely title as guaranteed by the state. The southern half of the palace remained available to him, as well as the Hermitage in Waghäusel. Amalie Christiane of Baden moved into the northern part of the palace in her widowhood and finally gave the palace Bruchsal its courtly splendor.

List of Australian inventions

Australian inventions include the very old, such as woomera, and the very new, such as the scramjet, first fired at the Woomera rocket range. The Australian government has suggested that Australian inventiveness springs from the nation's geography and isolation. Perhaps due to its status as an island continent connected to the rest of the world only by air and sea, Australians have been leaders in inventions relating to both maritime and aeronautical matters, including powered flight, the black box flight recorder, the inflatable escape slide, the surf ski, the wave-piercing catamaran winged keel. Since the earliest days of European settlement, Australia's main industries have been agriculture and mining, and Australian inventions in these areas have included the grain stripper, the stump jump plough, mechanical sheep shears, the Dethridge water wheel, the froth flotation ore separation process, the instream ore analysis process and the buffalo fly trap.
Australian inventions also include a number of weapons or weapons systems, including the woomera, the tank, and the underwater torpedo. In recent years, Australians have been at the forefront of medical technology with inventions including ultrasound, the bionic ear, the first plastic spectacle lenses, the electronic pacemaker, the multi-focal contact lens, spray-on artificial skin and anti-flu medication. Australians also developed a number of useful household items, including Vegemite, and the process for producing permanently creased fabric.
Many of Australia's inventions were realised by individuals who get little credit or who are often overlooked for more famous Americans or Europeans.
Australian Aborigine David Unaipon is known as "Australia's Leonardo" for his contributions to science and the Aboriginal people. His inventions include a tool for sheep-shearing, a centrifugal motor, a multi-radial wheel and mechanical propulsion device. Unaipon appears on Australia's $50 note.
The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is an Australian-government-funded institution. A number of CSIRO funded scientists and engineers are featured in this list. CSIRO scientists lead Australian research across a number of different fields, and work with industry and government to solve problems such as using insects to tackle weeds, growing more sustainable crops and improving transportation.
Aboriginal technology – before 1788.
Didgeridoo – The didgeridoo is a wind instrument of northern Australia. It is sometimes described as a "drone pipe," but musicologists classify it as an aerophone. Traditionally, the didgeridoo was made by selecting a section of Eucalyptus branch, which was then buried near a termite mound to produce a long, hollow piece of wood suitable for fashioning the instrument.
Woomera – The woomera is a type of spear thrower, adding thrust to a spear as part of a throwing action.
Colonial era – 19th century.
1838 – Pre-paid Postage – Colonial Postmaster-General of New South Wales, James Raymond introduced the world's first pre-paid postal system, using pre-stamped sheets as envelopes. This post-dates Rowland Hill's 1836 recommendation for the introduction of pre-paid stamps (the "Penny Black") in Britain, but pre-dates their first issue in 1840.
1843 – Grain stripper – John Wrathall Bull invented and John Ridley manufactured in South Australia the world's first mechanised grain stripper. It utilised a comb to lift the ears of the crop to where revolving beaters deposited the grain into a bin.
1856 – Refrigerator – Using the principle of vapour compression, James Harrison produced the world's first practical ice making machine and refrigerator.
1858 – Australian rules football – began its development when Tom Wills wrote a letter published in "Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle" on 10 July 1858, calling for a "foot-ball club, a rifle club, or other athletic pursuits" to keep cricketers fit during winter. An experimental match was played by Wills and others at the Richmond Paddock, later known as Yarra Park next to the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 31 July 1858.
The Melbourne Football Club rules of 1859 are the oldest surviving set of laws for Australian football. They were drawn up at the Parade Hotel, East Melbourne, on 17 May, by Wills, W. J. Hammersley, J. B. Thompson and Thomas Smith.
The Melbourne club’s game was not immediately adopted by neighbouring clubs. Before each match the rules had to be agreed by the two teams involved. By 1866, several other clubs had agreed to play by an updated version of Melbourne's rules.
1874 – Underwater torpedo – Invented by Louis Brennan, the torpedo had two propellers, rotated by wires which were attached to winding engines on the shore station. By varying the speed at which the two wires were extracted, the torpedo could be steered to the left or right by an operator on the shore.
1876 – Stump jump plough – Richard and Clarence Bowyer Smith developed a plough which could jump over stumps and stones, enabling newly cleared land to be cultivated.
1877 – Mechanical clippers – Various mechanical shearing patents were registered in Australia before Frederick York Wolseley finally succeeded in developing a practical hand piece with a comb and reciprocating cutter driven by power transmitted from a stationary engine.
1889 – Electric drill – Arthur James Arnot patented the world's first electric drill on 20 August 1889 while working for the Union Electric Company in Melbourne. He designed it primarily to drill rock and to dig coal.
1892 – Coolgardie safe – Arthur Patrick McCormick noticed that a wet bag placed over a bottle cooled its contents, and the cooling was more pronounced in a breeze. The Coolgardie safe was a box made of wire and hessian sitting in water, which was placed on a verandah so that any breeze would evaporate the water in the hessian and via the principle of evaporation, cool the air inside the box. The Coolgardie safe was used into the middle of the 20th century as a means of preserving food.
20th Century Post-Federation – 1901–1945.
1902 – Notepad – For 500 years, paper had been supplied in loose sheets. Launceston stationer J.A. Birchall decided that it would be a good idea to cut the sheets in half, back them with cardboard and glue them together at the top.
1903 – Froth flotation – The process of separating minerals from rock by flotation was developed by Charles Potter and Guillaume Delprat in New South Wales. Both worked independently at the same time on different parts of the process for the mining company Broken Hill Pty. Ltd. (BHP) 
1906 – Feature film – The world's first feature length film, The Story of the Kelly Gang, was a little over an hour long.
1906 – Surf life-saving reel – The first surf life-saving reel in the world was demonstrated at Bondi Beach on 23 December 1906 by its designer, Bondi surfer Lester Ormsby.
1907 – Michell thrust block bearing – Fluid-film thrust bearings were invented by Australian engineer George Michell. Michell bearings contain a number of sector-shaped pads, arranged in a circle around the shaft, and that are free to tilt. These create wedge-shaped regions of oil inside the bearing between the pads and a rotating disk, which support the applied thrust and eliminate metal-on-metal contact. The small size (one-tenth the size of old bearing designs), low friction and long life of Michell's invention made possible the development of larger propellers and engines in ships. They were used extensively in ships built during World War I, and have become the standard bearing used on turbine shafts in ships and power plants worldwide.
1910 – Humespun pipe-making process – The Humespun process was developed by Walter Hume of Humes Ltd for making concrete pipes of high strength and low permeability. The process used centrifugal force to evenly distribute concrete onto wire reinforcing, revolutionising pipe manufacture.
1910 – Dethridge wheel – The wheel, used to measure the water flow in an irrigation channel, consisting of a drum on an axle, with eight v-shaped vanes fixed to its outside, was invented by John Dethridge, Commissioner of the Victorian State Rivers and Water Supply Commission.
1912 – Surf ski – Harry McLaren and his brother Jack used an early version of the surf ski for use around the family's oyster beds on Lake Innes, near Port Macquarie, New South Wales, and the brothers used them in the surf on Port Macquarie's beaches. The board was propelled in a sitting position with two small hand blades, which was probably not a highly efficient method to negotiate the surf. The deck is flat with a bung plug at the rear and a nose ring with a leash, possibly originally required for mooring. The rails are square and there is pronounced rocker. The boards' obvious buoyancy indicates hollow construction, with thin boards of cedar fixed longtitudinally down the board.
1912 – Tank – A South Australian named Lance de Mole submitted a proposal to the British War Office, for a 'chain-rail vehicle which could be easily steered and carry heavy loads over rough ground and trenches complete with extensive drawings. The British war office rejected the idea at the time, but De Mole made several more proposals to the British War Office in 1914 and 1916, and formally requested he be recognised as the inventor of the Mark I tank. The British Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors eventually made a payment of £987 to De Mole to cover his expenses and promoted him to an honorary corporal.
1912 – Self-Propelled Rotary Hoe – At the age of 16 Cliff Howard of Gilgandra invented a machine with rotating hoe blades on an axle that simultaneously hoed the ground and pulled the machine forward.
1913 – Automatic totalisator -The world's first automatic totalisator for calculating horse-racing bets was made by Sir George Julius.
1928 – Electronic Pacemaker – The heart pacemaker had a portable apparatus which 'plugged into a lighting point. One pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution' while the other pole 'consisted of a needle insulated except at its point, and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber'. 'The pacemaker rate was not good from about 80 to 120 pulses per minute, and likewise the voltage variable from 1.5 to 120 volts.' The apparatus was used to revive a potentially stillborn infant at Crown Street Women's Hospital, Sydney whose heart continued 'to beat on its own accord', 'at the end of 10 minutes' of stimulation.
1930 – Clapperboard – The wooden marker used to synchronise sound and film was invented by Frank Thring Sr of Efftee Studios in Melbourne.
1934 – Coupé utility – The car body style, known colloquially as the ute in Australia and New Zealand, combines a two-door "coupé" cabin with an integral cargo bed behind the cabin—using a light-duty passenger vehicle-derived platform. It was designed by Lewis Brandt at the Ford Motor Company in Geelong, Victoria. The first ute rolled off the Ford production lines in 1934. The idea came from a Geelong farmer's wife who wrote to Ford in 1933 advising the need for a new sort of vehicle to take her 'to church on Sundays and pigs to market on Mondays.'
1938 – Polocrosse – Inspired by a training exercise witnessed at the National School of Equitation at Kingston Vale near London, Mr. and Mrs. Edward Hirst of Sydney invented the combination polo and lacrosse sport which was first played at Ingleburn near Sydney in 1939.
1940 – Zinc Cream – This white sun block made from zinc oxide was developed by the Fauldings pharmaceutical company.
1943 – Splayd – The combination of knife, fork and spoon was invented by William McArthur after seeing ladies struggle to eat at barbecues with standard cutlery from plates on their laps.
20th century Post-World War II.
1945 – Hills Hoist – The famous Hills Hoist rotary clothes line with a winding mechanism allowing the frame to be lowered and raised with ease was developed by Lance Hill in 1945, although the clothes line design itself was originally patented by Gilbert Toyne in Adelaide in 1926.
1952 – Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer – The atomic absorption spectrophotometer is a complex analytical instrument incorporating micro-computer electronics and precision optics and mechanics, used in chemical analysis to determine low concentrations of metals in a wide variety of substances. It was first developed by Sir Alan Walsh of the CSIRO.
1953 – Solar hot water – Developed by a team at the CSIRO led by Roger N Morse
1955 – Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) – Invented and developed by Edward George Bowen of the CSIRO, the first DME network, operating in the 200 MHz band, became operational in Australia.
1956 – Pneumatic broadacre air seeder – Invented and patented by Albert Fuss in 1956, the lightweight air seeder uses a spinning distributor, blew the seeds through a pipe into the plating tynes. It was first used that same year to sow wheat near Dalby in Queensland.
1957 – Flame ionisation detector – The flame ionisation detector is one of the most accurate instruments ever developed for the detection of emissions. It was invented by Ian McWilliam. The instrument, which can measure one part in 10 million, has been used in chemical analysis in the petrochemical industry, medical and biochemical research, and in the monitoring of the environment.
1957 – Wool clothing with a permanent crease – The process for producing permanently creased fabric was invented by Dr Arthur Farnworth of the CSIRO.
1958 – Black box flight recorder – The 'black box' voice and instrument data recorder was invented by Dr David Warren in Melbourne.
1960 – Plastic spectacle lenses – The world's first plastic spectacle lenses, 60 per cent lighter than glass lenses, were designed by Scientific Optical Laboratories in Adelaide.

1965 – Inflatable escape slide – The inflatable aircraft escape slide which doubles as a raft was invented by Jack Grant of Qantas.
1965 – Wine cask – Invented by Thomas Angove of Renmark, South Australia, the wine cask is a cardboard box housing a plastic container which collapses as the wine is drawn off, thus preventing contact with the air. Angroves' original design with a resealable spout was replaced with a tap by the Penfolds wine company in 1972
1970 – Staysharp knife – The self-sharpening knife was developed by Wiltshire.
1971 – Variable rack and pinion steering – The variable ratio rack and pinion steering in motor vehicles allowing smooth steering with minimal feedback was invented by Australian engineer, Arthur Bishop.
1972 – Orbital engine – The orbital internal combustion process engine was invented by engineer Ralph Sarich of Perth, Western Australia. The system uses a single piston to directly inject fuel into 5 orbiting chambers. It has never challenged the dominance of four-stroke combustion engines but has replaced many two-stroke engines with a more efficient, powerful and cleaner system. Orbital engines now appear in boats, motorcycles and small cars.
1972 – Instream analysis – To speed-up analysis of metals during the recovery process, which used to take up to 24 hours, Amdel Limited developed an on-the-spot analysis equipment called the In-Stream Analysis System, for the processing of copper, zinc, lead and platinum – and the washing of coal. This computerised system allowed continuous analysis of key metals and meant greater productivity for the mineral industry worldwide.
1972 – Power board – Peter Talbot, working under Frank Bannigan at Kambrook, invented the power board. This allows multiple electrical devices to be powered where only a single wall socket is available. This is a well-known example of failing to protect intellectual property. Kambrook was more interested in immediate commercial release than patenting its idea and has never received any royalties from this now ubiquitous product.
1974 – Super Sopper – Gordon Withnall at the age of 56 invented the Super Sopper, a giant rolling sponge used to quickly soak up water from sporting grounds so that play can continue.
1978 – Synroc – The synthetic ceramic Synroc that incorporates radioactive waste into its crystal structure was invented in 1978 by a team led by Dr Ted Ringwood at the Australian National University.
1979 – Digital sampler – The Fairlight CMI (Computer Musical Instrument) was the first polyphonic digital sampling synthesizer. It was designed in 1979 by the founders of Fairlight, Peter Vogel and Kim Ryrie in Sydney, Australia.
1979 – RaceCam – Race Cam was developed by Geoff Healey, an engineer with Australian Television Network Seven in Sydney. The tiny lightweight camera is used in sports broadcasts and provides viewers with spectacular views of events such as motor racing, which are impossible with conventional cameras.
1979 – Bionic ear – The cochlear implant was invented by Professor Graeme Clark of the University of Melbourne.
1980 – Dual flush toilet – Bruce Thompson, working for Caroma in Australia, developed the Duoset cistern, with two buttons, and two flush volumes as a water-saving measure, now responsible for savings in excess of 32000 litres of water per household per year.
1980 – Wave-piercing catamaran – The first high speed, stable catamarans were developed by Phillip Hercus and Robert Clifford of Incat in Tasmania.
1981 – CPAP mask – Professor Colin Sullivan of Sydney University developed the Continuous Positive Airflow Pressure (CPAP) mask. The CPAP system first developed by Sullivan has become the most common treatment for sleep disordered breathing. The invention was commercialised in 1989 by Australian firm ResMed, which is currently one of the world's two largest suppliers of CPAP technology.
1983 – Winged Keel – Ben Lexcen designed a winged keel that helped Australia II end the New York Yacht Club's 132-year ownership of the America's Cup. The keel gave the yacht better steering and manoeuvrability in heavy winds.
1984 – Frozen embryo baby- The world's first frozen embryo baby was born in Melbourne on 28 March 1984
1984 – Baby Safety Capsule – In 1984, for the first time babies had a bassinette with an air bubble in the base and a harness that distributed forces across the bassinette protecting the baby. New South Wales public hospitals now refuse to allow parents take a baby home by car without one.
1986 – Gene shears – The discovery of gene shears was made by CSIRO scientists, Wayne Gerlach and Jim Haseloff. So-called hammerhead ribozymes are bits of genetic material that interrupt a DNA code at a particular point, and can be designed to cut out genes that cause disease or dangerous proteins
1988 – Polymer banknote – The development of the polymer bank note was made by CSIRO scientists led by Dr. David Solomon. Securency Pty Ltd, a joint venture between the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and UCB, brought the note into full production and polymer bank notes are now used in 30 countries besides Australia. The chief advantages are high counterfeiting resistance and longer circulation lifetimes.
1989 – Polilight forensic lamp – Ron Warrender and Milutin Stoilovic, forensic scientists at the Australian National University in Canberra, developed Unilite which could be set to just the right wavelength to show fingerprints up well against any background. Rofin Australia Pty Ltd, developed this product into the portable Polilight which shows up invisible clues such as fingerprints and writing that has been scribbled over, as well as reworked sections on paintings.
1991 – Buffalo fly trap – In 1991 the CSIRO developed a low-tech translucent plastic tent with a dark inner tunnel lined with brushes. When a cow walks through, the brushed flies fly upwards toward the light and become trapped in the solar-heated plastic dome where they quickly die from desiccation (drying out) and fall to the ground, where ants eat them.
1992 – Multi-focal contact lens – The world's first multi-focal contact lens was invented by optical research scientist, Stephen Newman in Queensland.
1992 – Spray-on skin – Developed by Dr Fiona Wood at Royal Perth Hospital
1992 – Product Activation – Patented by Ric Richardson of Sydney's northern beaches initially to allow digital distribution of his own software. Now the process is used by the majority of software publishers in the world.
1992 – Wi-Fi – A method developed by CSIRO researchers used to "unsmear" radio waves that echo off indoor surfaces was patented. This method has caused WiFi to be attributed as an Australian invention, although the Wi-Fi trademark, under which most products are sold, is under the ownership of the Wi-Fi Alliance based in Austin, Texas.
1993 – Underwater PC – The world's first underwater computer with a five-button hand-held keypad was developed by Bruce Macdonald at the Australian Institute of Marine Science.
1993 – Frazier lens – The Frazier lens is a special camera lens designed by Australian photographer Jim Frazier. The Frazier lens provides a massive depth of field, allowing the foreground and background of an image to be in focus. Frazier's lenses have been widely used in Hollywood and wildlife cinematography.
1995 – EXELGRAM – The world's most sophisticated optical anti-counterfeiting technology was developed by the CSIRO.
1995 – Jindalee Radar System – Developed by Scientists at the CSIRO, the Jindalee Radar System detects stealth aircraft and missiles by searching for the air turbulence generated by such vehicles.
1996 – Anti-flu Medication – Relenza was developed by a team of scientists at the Victorian College of Pharmacy at Monash University in Melbourne. The team was led by Mark von Itzstein in association with the CSIRO. Relenza was discovered as a part of the Australian biotechnology company Biota's project to develop antiviral agents via rational drug design.
21st century.
2002 – Scramjet – On 30 July 2002, the University of Queensland's HyShot team and their international partners conducted the first ever successful test flight of a scramjet. This test was conducted at the rocket range in outback South Australia called Woomera.
2003 – Blast Glass – A ballistic and blast resistant glass system was invented by Peter Stephinson. Unlike conventional bulletproof glass it incorporates an air cavity to absorb the shock wave of explosions, and was effective in protecting the Australian Embassy in the Jakarta bombings of 2004.
2012 – Quantum bit – A team of Australian scientists built the first quantum bit, the basic unit of quantum computing, using a single phosphorus atom implanted into a silicon chip. Research leaders include Andrew Dzurak of the University of Sydney and Andrea Morello of the University of NSW.
2012 - The HEG - An Australian inventor, Scott Boocock, came up with the idea of reinventing the clothes peg by adding a hook. The idea came to him while he was hanging up a black garment for his wife. He needed a hook, so that peg-marks would not be left on the garment. The HEG went into production in September 2013 and was a Gold Winner in the South Australian Design Awards 2013. The invention was reported in the media on 15 December 2013 by Channel 7 News Australia.
2013 - Blood test to prevent stillbirth - A Melbourne medical research institution, Mercy Health, identified a method of analysing RNA fragments in a mother's blood that indicates oxygen and nutrient deprivation in the foetus.

Kokkuri (game)

The word "kokkuri" refers to the game, the actual physical apparatus, and the spirit(s) believed to possess the apparatus in order to communicate with humans. The physical mechanism is composed of three bamboo rods arranged to make a tripod, upon which is placed a small pot, which is covered by a cloth. Three or more people will place their hands upon the kokkuri and ask the spirits a question, which that spirit will in theory answer by moving the pot or remaining still. 
Japanese folklorist Inoue Enryō wrote about the kokkuri phenomenon, denouncing it as mere superstition, yet his efforts did not succeed in depopularizing the game. Some scientific figures of the age attempted to explain the phenomena with the more scientific sounding yet ultimately equally mysterious term "human electricity".
