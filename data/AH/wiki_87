Norwich park and ride

Norwich Park and Ride is a park and ride bus service in the city of Norwich, East Anglia. The first of the park and rides was opened in the early 1990s at Norwich International Airport in Hellesdon, while the sixth (and currently final) site was opened in Thickthorn in 2005. With the addition of the final site, the Norwich Park and Ride became the largest park and ride services in the United Kingdom, and provided the scheme with over 5000 permanent car parks – at the time the highest number for a park and ride scheme in the country. The scheme has proven to be quite successful, winning the British Parking Association Park and Ride award in 2004, and in the 2006/2007 financial year, 3.3 million people used the service, keeping 940,000 cars out of the city centre.
Thickthorn Park & Ride - Service 601.
Thickthorn Park & Ride is located near Thickthorn services in Hethersett (NR9 3AU). The site first opened in 2005, making it the newest Park & Ride site in Norwich.
'Konect Bus', a Norfolk bus company, operate the service using three VDL DB250PF/Wrightbus Pulsar Gemini's in a pink livery. Each bus has a seating capacity of 65. There are three vehicles in the Thickthorn Park & Ride livery. YJ05PXA (fleet no. 500), YJ05PXB (fleet no. 501) and YJ05PXC (fleet no. 502). For more information visit the KonectBus website.
Harford Park & Ride - Service 602.
Harford Park & Ride is located on Ipswich Road, Norwich (NR4 6DY). 
Prior to 2010, when First Group owned the contract, Volvo B7TL Double Decker Buses were used. 
Now that 'Konect Bus', a Norfolk bus company, operate the service, they use three Dennis Trident 2/ADL Enviro 400's in a blue livery. Each bus has a seating capacity of 80.
There are three vehicles in the Harford Park & Ride livery. SN10CFD (fleet no. 600), SN10CFE (fleet no. 601) and SN10CFF (fleet no. 602). For more information visit the KonectBus website.
Airport Park & Ride - Service 603.
Airport Park & Ride is located on Buck Courtney Crescent, next to the entrance to Norwich International Airport.
Prior to 2010, 603 was operated using Irisbus Agoraline's in a yellow livery. 
Now that 'Norse Group', operate the service, they use four Transbus Trident/Plaxton President's in a turquoise livery.
There are four vehicles in the Airport Park & Ride livery. PN03ULT (fleet no. 7161), PN03UMD (fleet no. 7167), PN03UME (fleet no. 7168) and PN03UMG (fleet no. 7169).
Costessey Park & Ride - Service 604.
Costessey Park & Ride is located next to the Royal Norfolk Showground in Costessey, Norwich.
Prior to 2012, 604 was operated using Optare Tempo's in a green livery. 
However, in 2012, operator 'Konect Bus' realised that the buses were simply too small to operate this service. They made the decision to use three Mercedes Citaro Articulated buses in a green livery.
There are three vehicles in the Costessey Park & Ride livery, one still awaiting vinyls. BX54UDK (fleet no. 805), BX54UDV (fleet no. 806) and BX54UEA (fleet no. 807). Each vehicle has a seating capacity of 49.
The Optare Tempo's previously used on the 604 were re-painted into the standard Konect Bus livery, and now operate other routes.
Postwick & Sprowston Park & Ride - Services 605 & 606.
In late 2011, Norfolk County Council made the decision to merge the Postwick P&R (Service 605) with Sprowston P&R (Service 606), to allow Postwick Park & Ride passengers to travel to Anglia Square. Previously, the Postwick Park & Ride's route was direct to Norwich Bus Station from Postwick, while the Sprowston Park & Ride's route saw commuters travel from Sprowston to Norwich Bus Station via Anglia Square and Castle Meadow. The new route combined the two, traveling from Postwick to Sprowston via Norwich Bus Station, Castle Meadow and Anglia Square.
Although the two routes have now combined, Norse still use two different coloured buses. Previously, Postwick P&R buses were red/orange, and Sprowston buses were purple. The buses are still in those colours, but are now branded with 'Postwick - City Centre - Sprowston' above the usual Park & Ride logo.
The buses in the purple livery are PN03ULL (fleet no. 7158), PN03ULU (fleet no. 7162) and PN03UMC (fleet no. 7166).
The buses in the orange/red livery are PN03UMA (fleet no. 7165), PN03ULP (fleet no. 7159) and PN03ULR (fleet no. 7160).
PN03ULX used to operate the Postwick Park & Ride service, until it tragically caught fire on Postwick roundabout in May 2011, or 2010? Luckily, nobody was harmed or injured.
Description.
There are six purpose-built sites operating into Norwich bus station using colour-coded buses offering some 5000 parking spaces. Services begin running into the city at 06:40 Monday to Friday, with the last buses returning from 19:25 (20:30 on Thursday).
All sites operated by Norse and services are run by Norse and Konectbus. In 2006 a total 3.4 million passengers used the service.
2005-2010 Contract.
Between 2005-2010 the sites were managed and operated by three companies: First, KonectBus and Norse. Thickthorn Park & Ride was operated by konectbus, using the same VDL DB250PF/Wrightbus Pulsar Gemini's as what currently operate the 601 today. Harford Park & Ride was operated by First using B7TL/ALX400's. Airport was operated by Norse, using Yellow Irisbus Agora Line's and Costessey was operated by konectbus using Optare Tempo's. Postwick was operated by Norse using Irisbus Agora Line's and Sprowston was run by First, using purple B7RLE/Eclipse Urban's.
Proposed development.
Expansion of Postwick site.
It is proposed to add 500 places to the Postwick site as part of the Postwick Hub development which is associated with the Norwich Northern Distributor Road development.
Buses.
All buses used on the services are low-floor and are colour-coded.
Norse operates the Norwich International Airport, Postwick and Sprowston services, using turquoise, orange and purple Plaxton President double deckers.
Konectbus operates the Harford, Thickthorn and Costessey services, using pink DAF DB250/Wright Pulsar Gemini double deckers, blue Alexander Dennis Enviro 400 double deckers and green Optare Tempo single deckers.

1991–92 Yugoslav Cup

The Football Cup of Yugoslavia of 1991 to 1992 was the national knock-out football competition in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during its transition to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
The republics of Croatia and Slovenia declared their independence on June 25, 1991 during the football off-season. By the Brioni Agreement, the two republics delayed the implementation of independence until October 8. While the two countries were nominally still part of Yugoslavia, their clubs withdrew from the Yugoslav football system. Over the course of the competition, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence on September 8, 1991 and March 5, 1992 respectively. On April 28, 1992 the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was constituted by Montenegro and Serbia.
Prior to this season, the cup had borne the name "Marshal Tito Cup". This was discontinued as the previous year's champion Hajduk Split had failed to return the Marshal Tito Trophy to the Football Association of Yugoslavia, which no longer had jurisdiction over the club.

Pistoleer

A pistoleer is a soldier trained to use a pistol, or more generally anyone armed with such a weapon.
The earliest kind of pistoleer was the mounted German Reiter, who came to prominence in Europe after the Battle of St. Quentin in 1557. These soldiers were equipped with a number of single-shot, muzzle-loader wheel-lock or Snaphance pistols, amongst the most advanced weapons of the era. Although mounted Pistoleers were effective against heavy cavalry, they gradually fell out of use during the Thirty Years War. After this time, cavalry in Western armies used swords or lances as their primary arm, although they still generally carried a pistol as a sidearm. 
Horse-mounted pistoleers of a kind made a brief comeback in North America during the American Civil War (particularly by the Confederates) as well as in the conflicts against the Native Americans of the 1860s and 70s. This was a consequence of the adoption of the multi-shot revolver, which gave horsemen much more firepower.

KMB Route 71B

KMB Route 71B is a circular bus route that serves Tai Po. It is operated by Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB), and is known as the shortest and cheapest franchised bus route in Hong Kong. This route is served by air-cond. buses only.
Route history.
Route 71B commenced services on 27 June 1991. The original terminus was located at Tai Po Central, and the bus fare was $0.5. The route brought convenience to the residents of Fu Heng Estate, who were able to interchange at Tai Po Central to routes 72X, 73X, 74X, and 75X.
The fare was adjusted on 5 April 1993 to $0.7. Route 271 became a regular route that operated daily since 5 November 1993, so route 71B lost its purpose of a feeder route. The fare was raised from $0.7 to $1.0 on the same day. However, $1.0 was still a relatively low fare; the fare standard for bus routes under 3 kilometres was $1.6 in 1993. Therefore, KMB requested a fare adjustment to $1.5, but was turned down.
Many buses at that time were already air-conditioned, but air-conditioning of route 71B has created a major disagreement between Tai Po District Council and KMB. Converting from regular buses to air-conditioned buses only means fare raise, because the route is very short and residents did not mind taking non-air-conditioned buses. KMB planned to convert the route to air-conditioned buses only in 2002, but was declined again. It was not until December 31 2004 that the route was converted, but the Tai Po District Council demanded the fare be dropped because the fare was too high.
Citybus Route 12S replaced 71B as the shortest franchised bus route in Hong Kong after it commenced services on 1 February 2000. Route 71B was again known as the shortest bus route after 12S was discontinued on 3 May 2004. Since 31 December 2004, the new fare of $1.7 replaced Citybus Routes 97A and 98 as the cheapest franchised bus route in Hong Kong operated solely by air-conditioned buses.

Kelly Corrigan

Kelly Corrigan (born August 16, 1967) is a New York Times bestselling writer living in the San Francisco Bay Area with her husband, Edward Lichty, and their two daughters. She is a graduate of The University of Richmond and received a Masters in Literature from San Francisco State University.
Writing.
Corrigan's first book, “The Middle Place,” is a memoir about her Irish-American father’s battle with cancer and her own triumph over the disease. It was published on January 8, 2008 (hardcover) and December 23, 2008 (paperback). At its peak, the hardcover reached #16 on the Hardcover Non-fiction New York Times bestseller list. The paperback has reached #2 on the Trade Paperback Non-fiction New York Times bestseller list to date. "The Middle Place" was also recognized by Barnes and Noble as part of the "Discover Great New Writers" campaign. 
Her second book, entitled "Lift" and published in 2010, is written in the form of a letter to her children, and is an examination of risk and parenthood through the lens of 3 true stories.
“Glitter and Glue,” Corrigan’s third book, is due to be published by Random House in February 2014.
Corrigan is also the author of an essay about "women's remarkable capacity to support each other, to laugh together, and to endure" called "Transcending", a reading of which by the author and released by Hyperion/Voice became a YouTube sensation. The video has received over 4 million views on YouTube to date. 
In addition to her long form work in memoir and nonfiction, Corrigan has contributed to O, The Oprah Magazine, Good Housekeeping, Glamour, and other print and online publications. She is a four-time guest on The Today Show.
Cancer Outreach.
Shortly after her own battle with breast cancer, Corrigan launched Circus Of Cancer, a how-to web site for friends and family of women with the disease. The website includes a photo album of her own struggle against breast cancer and writings in such categories as “Finding a Lump” and “Losing My Hair.” Below is an excerpt from “Getting the Diagnosis”: 
At 1pm, Emily Birenbaum called and said these exact words: "Kelly, I understand that you called in this morning. I have the biopsy report and Kelly, it's cancer." I called out, "Edward!" and he came to me and we crowded around the phone, politely asking the simplest of questions. "Is the test always correct?" "Does it say how much cancer there is?" "Could it be a false positive?" After a very short conversation where we learned the phrase 'invasive ductal carcinoma', we hung up. The girls were at our knees, needing to be fed and put down for a nap. There was so much to do, on so many fronts, that the only thing to do was to start doing.
Notes and Words.
Corrigan created the philanthropy Notes and Words in 2010, and has since raised over $2 million for Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland in California. An annual benefit, Notes & Words features bestselling authors and top recording artists onstage together at the Fox Theatre in Oakland. The event in 2012 raised over $600,000 and had an attendance of 1800 people. The co-chairs of the philanthropy – Corrigan, Melissa Williams and Kristina Smith – are all grateful parents whose children have received services and care from Children’s Hospital & Research Center Oakland.
Past Notes and Words performers include Michael Lewis, Anne Lamott, Michael Chabon, as well as musicians CAKE and The Family Crest. The 2013 lineup included G. Love and Special Sauce, Goodnight, Texas, Oakland School of the Arts, Billy Collins, Mary Roach, Kelly Corrigan herself, and Lauren Graham.

Survival radio

Survival radios are carried by ships and aircraft to facilitate rescue in an emergency. They are generally designed to transmit on international distress frequencies. Maritime systems have been standardized under the Global Maritime Distress Safety System.
History.
The use of radio to aid in rescuing survivors of accidents at sea came to the forefront after the sinking of the RMS "Titanic" in 1912. Lifeboats were equipped with spark gap transmitters such as the Marconi Type 241, c. 1920. These operated using Morse code on 500 kHz, the international distress frequency at the time. This frequency had the advantage of long range due to ground-wave propagation and was constantly monitored by all large ships at sea after the" Titanic"'s sinking. However, due to its wavelength of 600 meters, a long antenna was required to achieve good range. Long wires on the order of 1/4 wavelength held up by kites or balloons were often used. Spark-gap continued to be used in lifeboats long after the technology was banned for general communication.
The Gibson Girl.
During World War II, Germany developed a hand-crank 500 kHz rescue radio, the "Notsender" (emergency transmitter) NS2. It used two vacuum tubes and was crystal-controlled. The radio case curved inward in the middle so that a user seated in an inflatable life boat could hold it stationary, between the legs and above the knees, while the generator handle was turned. The distress signal, in Morse code, was produced automatically as the crank handle was turned. An NS2 unit was captured by the British in 1941, who produced a copy, the Dinghy Transmitter T-1333. Britain gave a second captured unit to the United States, which produced its own copy, the SCR-578. United States Army Air Forces aircraft carried the SCR-578 on over-water operations. Named the "Gibson Girl" because of its hourglass shape, it was supplied with a fold-up metal frame box kite, or a balloon with a small hydrogen generator, for which the flying line was the aerial wire. Power was provided by a hand cranked generator. The transmitter component was the BC-778. The frequency was 500 kHz at 4.8 watts, giving it a range of . Keying could be automatic SOS, or manual. Crystals were a scarce item for the U.S. during the war and the SCR-578 was not crystal-controlled.
A post-World War II version, the AN/CRT-3, which added a frequency in the 8 MHz range, was in use by ships and civil aircraft until the early 1970s.
VHF era.
The use of aircraft for search and rescue in World War II brought line-of-sight VHF radios into use. The much shorter wavelengths of VHF allowed a simple dipole or whip antenna to be effective. Early devices included the British Walter, a compact single vacuum tube oscillator design operating at 177 MHz (1.7 meter wavelength), and the German Jäger (NS-4), a two-tube master oscillator power amplifier design at 58.5 and, later, 42 MHz. These were small enough to include in life rafts used on single-seat fighter aircraft.
Post-war designs included the British Search And Rescue And Homing beacon (SARAH) beacon, the U.S. AN/URC-4 and the Soviet R 855U. These operated on the aircraft emergency frequencies of 121.5 and 243 MHz (2.5 and 1.2 meter wavelengths).
Automated beacon systems.
After a light plane with two U.S. congressmen on board went down in 1972 and could not be found, the U.S. began requiring all aircraft to carry an Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) that would turn on automatically in the event of a crash. Initially these units sent beacon signals on the 121.5 MHz aircraft emergency frequency. These are being phased out in favor of rescue beacons that use a 406.025 MHz signal, which can be picked up by the Cospas-Sarsat international satellite system for search and rescue. Each 406 MHz beacon has a unique digital ID code. Users are required to register the code with the Cospas-Sarsat, allowing inquiries to be made when a distress signal is picked up. Some advanced models can transmit a location derived from an internal GPS or GLONASS receiver.
Maritime practice has shifted from rescue radios on 500 kHz distress frequency (which is no longer officially monitored) to the Global Maritime Distress Safety System, which includes use of the Cospas-Sarsat system and other measures, including radar transponders and hand-held marine VHF radios.
U.S. Military survival radios.
Military organizations still issue pilots and other combat personnel individual survival radios, which have become increasingly sophisticated, with built-in Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), Global Positioning Satellite receivers, and satellite communication. United States military survival radios include:

Pleiades (supercomputer)

Pleiades (pronounced // or //) is a petascale supercomputer housed at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) facility at NASA Ames Research Center located at Moffett Field near Mountain View, California. It is maintained by NASA and partners Silicon Graphics (SGI) and Intel.
As of November 2013 it is ranked the world's sixteenth fastest computer on the TOP500 list with a LINPACK rating of 1.54 petaflops (1.54 quadrillion floating point operations per second) and a peak performance of 2.87 petaflops. The ultimate goal of the partnership between NASA and SGI is to attain a peak supercomputing performance of 10 petaflops, or 10 quadrillion floating point operations per second, in order to "increase the computational capabilities for research, modeling and simulation work at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) facility."
History.
Built in 2008 and named for the Pleiades open star cluster, the supercomputer debuted as the third most powerful supercomputer in the world at 487 teraflops. It originally contained 100 SGI Altix ICE 8200EX racks with 12,800 Intel Xeon quad-core E5472 Harpertown processors connected with more than 20 miles of InfiniBand double data rate (DDR) cabling.
With the addition of ten more racks of quad-core X5570 Nehalem processors in 2009, Pleiades ranked sixth on the November 2009 TOP500 with 14,080 processors running at 544 teraflops. In January 2010, the scientists and engineers at NAS successfully completed a “live integration” of another ICE 8200 rack by connecting the new rack’s InfiniBand dual port fabric via 44 fibre cables while the supercomputer was still running a full workload, saving 2 million hours in productivity that would previously have been lost.
Another expansion in 2010 added 32 new SGI Altix ICE 8400 racks with Intel Xeon six-core X5670 Westmere processors, bringing up to 18,432 processors (81,920 cores in 144 racks) at a theoretical peak of 973 teraflops and a LINPACK rating of 773 teraflops. NASA also put an emphasis on keeping Pleiades energy efficient, increasing the power efficiency with each expansion so that in 2010 it was three times more power-efficient than the original 2008 components, which were the most power-efficient at the time. The integration of the six-core Westmere nodes also required new quad data rate (QDR) and hybrid DDR/QDR InfiniBand cabling, making the world's largest InfiniBand interconnect network with more than 45 miles of cable.
After another 14 ICE 8400 racks containing Westmere processors were added in 2011, Pleiades ranked seventh on the TOP500 list in June of that year at a LINPACK rating of 1.09 petaflops, or 1.09 quadrillion floating point operations per second.
InfiniBand DDR and QDR fiber cables are used to connect the all of nodes to each other, as well as to the mass storage systems at NAS and the hyperwall visualization system, creating a network made up of more than 65 miles of InfiniBand fabric, the largest of its kind in the world. Pleiades is built in a partial 11-D hypercube technology, where each node has eleven connections to eleven other nodes, with some making up to twelve connections to form a 12-D hypercube.
In 2012, NASA and partners SGI and Intel began working on the integration of 24 new Altix ICE X racks with Intel Xeon eight-core E5-2760 Sandy Bridge processors to replace 27 of the original Alitx 8200 racks containing quad-core Harpertown processors. With a total of 126,720 processor cores and over 233 terabytes of RAM across 182 racks, the expansion increased Pleiades' available computing capacity 40 percent. Each new Sandy Bridge node has four networking links using fourteen data rate (FDR) InfiniBand cable for a total transfer bandwidth of 56 gigabits (about 7 gigabytes) per second.
In early 2013, work began on a larger hardware refresh for Pleiades, ultimately removing all of the original 4-core Harpertown processors and adding 46 SGI ICE X racks with 10-core Intel Xeon E5-2680V2 (Ivy Bridge) processors. When installation was complete in August 2013, the system's overall peak performance increased 62% from 1.78 petaflops to 2.87 petaflops. 
Role at NASA.
Pleiades is part of NASA’s High-End Computing Capability (HECC) Project and represents NASA’s state-of-the-art technology for meeting the agency’s supercomputing requirements, enabling NASA scientists and engineers to conduct high-fidelity modeling and simulation for NASA missions in Earth studies, space science, aeronautics research, as well as human and robotic space exploration.
Some of the scientific and engineering projects run on Pleiades include:

Aliquippa School District

The Aliquippa School District is a small, urban public school district located in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. The district serves the City of Aliquippa. Aliquippa School District encompasses approximately . According to 2010 federal census data, it serves a resident population of 9,438 people. In 2009, the district residents’ per capita income was $13,718, while the median family income was $34,003. In the Commonwealth, the median family income was $49,501 and the United States median family income was $49,445, in 2010.
According to District officials, in school year 2007–08 the district provided basic educational services to 1,170 pupils through the employment of 124 teachers, 74 full-time and part-time support personnel, and nine administrators. Today the Aliquippa Public School District consists of two facilities, Aliquippa Elementary School (K-6) and Aliquippa Junior/Senior High School (7-12).
History.
The present Aliquippa School District, originally the Woodlawn School District, was organized on June 7, 1909. The borough of Woodlawn was incorporated from Hopewell Township in 1908. Its population drawn to the area by the establishment of the Aliquippa Works of Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation along the Ohio River.
According to historian Ivagean Ferry, from whose "Brief History of Education in Aliquippa" much of the information in this account has been taken, two districts had been in operation in the area - the Logstown Independent District and the Aliquippa School District. In 1928 Aliquippa was renamed West Aliquippa when it consolidated with the town of Woodlawn, the larger borough, which at that time took the Indian name of Aliquippa."
The Woodlawn District in 1909 elected its first Board of School Directors: H. J. Johns, president; John T. Bell, secretary; W. G. Cochran (a non-member), treasurer; and members, C. H. Dinsmore, G. Walter Prosser, G. W. Gray, and J. H. Robb.
The challenge to the district, headed by Calvin Springer, was finding classrooms for its 225 pupils. They were housed in the Woodlawn Academy, the old Logstown School, and a room in the Dinsmore house on Hopewell Avenue. The ten-room Highland School was the first neighborhood school erected. In 1911 the eight-room Logstown School was constructed. Woodlawn High School, a two story building of twelve rooms, opened in 1913. Laughlin School was built in 1917; Jones School was erected in 1919 by that time the student population was 2,000.
The first high school students of Woodlawn had been housed in elementary schools or sent to Beaver for senior classes and graduation. In 1913 the first senior class was graduated from the Logstown Building: Lehman Howard, Elvira Davis, Carol Howard, Eleanor Calhoun, Edwin Davis, and Ruth Scott. The first class to be graduated from Woodlawn High School was the class of 1914: Dewitt Baker, Rose Eberlie, Helen McGaughy, Alda Johnson, Ruth Stevenson, Orie Cochran, and Joseph Cochran.
In 1921, Woodlawn withdrew from Beaver County supervision and became an independent district, headed by Superintendent 0. H. Locke.
Less than ten years after the construction of Woodlawn High School, a new high school was erected on a hilltop overlooking Franklin Avenue. With its 34 classrooms, laboratories and offices, the high school was completed in 1925. A second building phase followed: the construction of a gymnasium-auditorium and the first part of a vocational shop on the hill above the school. Named Harding High School, in 1930 it was renamed the Aliquippa High School. A two-story wing was added to the high school in 1929.
In 1925 the borough annexed New Sheffield from Hopewell Township. The ten-room New Sheffield School was constructed in 1931. At the other end of the town, the McDonald School was built in 1940.
One of Aliquippa's most innovative and successful administrators was H. R. Vanderslice, who became superintendent of the schools on May 6, 1926. Mrs. Ferry writes that he believed "the basic philosophy that life and education are inseparable; that school life should be vitalized by tying it directly to the things people see and do outside of school." Based on John Dewey's philosophy, progressive education characterized the Aliquippa elementary schools.
For the secondary grades, Mr. Vanderslice encouraged "purposeful activities of a recreational and aesthetic nature ... that would cultivate talents and social skills for better living." A high school band was organized under A. D. Davenport in 1926. In 1928, Director Davenport composed the music and Clifford J. Smith, a high school teacher, wrote the words of "Wave Red and Black," which became Aliquippa's almamater. In 1930 Joseph Marchetti created a four-year art course. An outstanding teacher, he was awarded the Silver Award of the Eastern Arts Association.
The school population had grown to 6,600 students by 1929. Because the district could not provide new schools immediately, in 1928, all-year-round school was the district's answer to the problem. As Mrs. Ferry explains, the all-year round plan "set up four quarters of twelve weeks each ... The distribution of enrollment was made so that three-fourths of the children were in school and one-fourth on vacation each quarter."
When Superintendent Vanderslice resigned in 1937, Lytle M. Wilson was chosen to succeed him in a post he held until 1955. Named assistant superintendent was Archibald D. Dungan. Robert Crawford became the high school principal and Dr. C. Earl Shank, the Franklin junior High School principal. Elementary principals included Mrs. Elizabeth S. Lesquin, Leotta Caldwell, Herbert E. Scott, and Mrs. Elvira K. McDonald. Mrs. Olive Tschippert became curriculum coordinator for the elementary grades.
Named school psychologist in 1949, Mrs. Lesquin held that position until June, 1958, when she resigned. In 1958, Dr. Anne K. Davies was appointed school psychologist and elementary supervisor.
Since enrollments were still increasing in the elementary grades, an addition was made to the New Sheffield building in 1954. In 1956 a junior high school was constructed with a capacity of 1,200. The principal of the school was Dr. C. Earl Shank.
Every school district has outstanding teachers; to list them all is impossible. However, when a community publicly honors its educators, the historian must take note. The Aliquippa Chamber of Commerce presented Man of the Year Awards to Lawrence Blaney in 1958, to Clifford J. Smith in 1963, and to Samuel Milanovich in 1964. Coach Carl Aschman was named Man of the Year in Sports in 1959. Mrs. Olive Tschippert was awarded the Woman of the Year Award by the Chamber in 1966. Roger Jones and Donald Adams were presented the Brotherhood Award in 1952 and 1965, respectively. Honored as Woman of the Year in 1965 by the Aliquippa Business and Professional Women's Club was Caroline Theil. Mrs. Charlotte M. Bacon was named Woman of the Year by the Aliquippa Branch, American Association of University Women in 1980. Mrs. Elizabeth Carver was elected to the Aliquippa Hall of Fame in 1980, honored for her organization of Play Day for county girls and for leadership in girls' sports.
With the sixties came serious challenges. Late in the decade, racial unrest led to upheavals in the junior and senior high schools and to the temporary closing of the schools in 1970. A comprehensive survey of the community and its schools was made. The district set up a study team of members of the National Education Association and the state and Pittsburgh chapters of the N.A.A.C.P., which met with the mayor's bi-racial Human Relations Committee to try to find solutions. Lawrence M. Maravich, elected superintendent in 1966, reported on policies being put into practice to promote equality of opportunity. It was found imperative to put the child first, not the curriculum. To desegregate the schools, Aliquippa changed its organizational structure and grouped classes into three units: for elementary school, 
K–4, for middle school, 5–8, for high school, 9–12. Buildings used were the high school, the former junior high school, which became a middle school, and the New Sheffield Elementary School. In 1987–88 only the high school and the New Sheffield School were in use.
Rather unexpectedly, in the eighties came the collapse of the industry that had created and nourished the community. The Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation met economic distress by making plant-wide lay-offs and at last by selling out to LTV. The schools suffered devastating effects. Unemployment continued for years, and many left the area. Student enrollments dropped through the decade. In October 1987, only 1,779 students were enrolled in a district that had once enlisted more than 6,000 students. Today only three of the original 11 schools stand, New Sheffield Elementary School is now the newly renovated Aliquippa Elementary School, Aliquippa Junior High School is now the newly renovated Aliquippa Junior-Senior High School, and Laughlin School is now Beaver County Headstarts Aliquippa School.
2008 Renovations.
In 2006 the Aliquippa School Board of Directors wanted to renovate and restore the at the time the Aliquippa Middle School Gym. The Aliquippa School District at the time consisted of three facilities Aliquippa Elementary School, Aliquippa Middle School, and Aliquippa High School. At the time the Aliquippa`s schools were not in the greatest shape. Aliquippa Elementary School, originally New Sheffield Elementary School, was built in 1931 and had signs of serious wear. Aliquippa Middle School formerly the Aliquippa Jr. High School was built in 1959 and was showing its signs of wear, and Aliquippa High School was built in 1924 and was in a state of deterioration. The Aliquippa School Board ordered an inspection of all three facilities and then decided to renovate in 2007. The School Board began making proposals and receiving plans. Due to declining enrollment the Aliquippa School District finally accepted the Burt Hill Proposal and they would renovate the Elementary School from grades K–4 to K–6 and renovate Aliquippa Middle School with the high school rearrange the grades from 5–8 to 7–12 and rename it the Aliquippa Junior/Senior High School. The Aliquippa School Board appointed USG Construction and groundbreaking took place in May,2008 and the construction began the following day. The renovations ended later on in the year. The project cost $40,000,000 but it was worth it. The Aliquippa Schools are today the Pride of many Aliquippeans.
Aliquippa Elementary School.
The Aliquippa Elementary School has had a long history that starts here. In 1929 the Borough of Aliquippa annexed New Sheffield from Hopewell Township. In 1930 the Aliquippa School District acquired the Cooper Farm for the construction of a new Elementary School. New Sheffield Elementary School dedicated March 6, 1931 was a three story brick structure which housed ten rooms. The building was built so that expansion to the original structure was more easily accommodated. The building was constructed of J&L Junior I Beams that allowed for superior construction. In 1954 the school was renovated with a seven room two story brick structure to the south and a small gymnasium to the North. In 1978 the original gymnasium was removed and a three story concrete panel wing was built, a three story brick structure, and a new gym was added. In 1992 New Sheffield Elementary School was renamed Aliquippa Elementary School, This was done due to the Aliquippa School District minimizing schools due to declining enrollment. In 2008 the Aliquippa School Board of Directors decided to realign the grades in the current schools. AES was renovated with Fifth and Sixth Grades, A three Story Brick structure was renovated towards Kennedy Boulevard, A Kitchen was added onto the Two Story 1954 annex, and the Gym was expanded. In 2011 the Aliquippa School Board decided to move the School District Offices to the Elementary School. Today the Elementary School enrolls over 500 students.
Aliquippa Junior/Senior High School.
In 1956 The Aliquippa School District began looking for sites to construct a new Junior High School Facility. In 1957 a site was chosen on top of the hill overlooking the High School, and in 1958 construction began on the new building, and in 1959 Aliquippa Junior High School was dedicated and was built to house 1,200 pupils and was built to house grades 5 to 8. The building was renamed Aliquippa Middle School in the 1970s. Then March 7, 1985 the Aliquippa School Board voted to close Aliquippa Middle School after only 20 years of service. The school board decided to then realign the grades. New Sheffield Elementary School ( Currently Aliquippa Elementary School ) will house grades Kindergarten through Sixth Grade and Aliquippa High School would house grades Seventh through Tweleth Grade. By that time Aliquippa High School would be renamed Aliquippa Junior/Senior High School. It remained that until 1992 when the Aliquippa School Board decided to renovate the former Junior High building, open it, and rename it Aliquippa Middle School. It remained this until 2008 when the Aliquippa School District renovated the middle school building with the high school and renamed it Aliquippa Junior/Senior High School and enrolls 492 pupils.
Aliquippa Senior High School.
In 1909 the then Woodlawn School District built Woodlawn High School on the foot of the Plan 12 Hill over Franklin Avenue. This school served the Borough of Woodlawn for many years until 1923, In 1924 the dedication ceremony was conducted for the new Harding High School, The School was named after the late president Warren G. Harding. Woodlawn High School was renamed Franklin School until it was demolished in 1988. In 1931 Harding High School was renamed Aliquippa High School this was done due to the Merger of Woodlawn and Aliquippa three years earlier in 1928. In 1954 a Auditorium was built. In 2008 the Aliquippa High School was in a State of Deterioration. The Aliquippa School Board decided to move high school students up to the middle school which was being renovated. The School was demolished in 2010. Today Aliquippa High School is in the memories of many Aliquippeans.
Possible mergers.
Ever since the collapse of the steel mills in Aliquippa, the Aliquippa Public Schools have had declining enrollment. The Aliquippa School Board has made 6 attempts to merge with the nearby Hopewell Area School District hoping it will sustain declining enrollment. Unfortunately the Hopewell Area School District has declined Aliquippas requests. One attempt was made to merge with Center Area School District now Central Valley School District, unfortunately Center declined Aliquippa. One attempt was made to merge with the new Central Valley School District and it was declined again.

Governance.
The school district is governed by nine individually elected board members (serve four-year terms), the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Pennsylvania General Assembly. The federal government controls programs it funds like Title I funding for low-income children in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act, which mandates the district focus resources on student success in acquiring reading and math skills.
The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives Sunshine Review gave the school board and district administration a "F" for transparency based on a review of "What information can people find on their school district's website". It examined the school district's website for information regarding; taxes, the current budget, meetings, school board members names and terms, contracts, audits, public records information and more.
Academic achievement.
Aliquippa School District was ranked 101st out of 105 Western Pennsylvania School Districts in 2012, by the "Pittsburgh Business Times". The ranking was based on the last three years of student academic performance on the PSSAs for: math, reading, writing and science.
Graduation rate.
In 2011 Aliquippa School District reported a graduation rate of 85%. In 2010, the Pennsylvania Department of Education issued a new, four year cohort graduation rate. Aliquippa School District's rate was 76% for 2010.
Traditional graduation rate:
In 2007 Johns Hopkins University reported that Aliquippa Senior High School was among 47 Pennsylvania schools and 1700 nationwide high schools with high dropout rates.
High school.
Aliquippa Junior Senior High School is located at 100 Harding Avenue, Aliquippa. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2010, the school reported an enrollment of 509 pupils in grades 7–12, with 385 pupils eligible for a federal free or reduced-price lunch due to family poverty. The school employed teachers, yielding a student–teacher ratio of 13:1. According to a report by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 100% of the teachers were rated "Highly Qualified" under No Child Left Behind.
In 2011 Aliquippa Junior-Senior High School achieved AYP status. In 2010 the school achieved Warning status. In 2009, Aliquippa High School was in Corrective Action II 2nd Year due to chronic, low academic achievement of its students.
The school's eleventh grade ranked 109th out of 123 western Pennsylvania high schools for student academic achievement in 2009. The ranking was made by the Pittsburgh Business Times. It was based on three years of PSSA results on: reading, writing, math and one year of science.
In 2007 Johns Hopkins University listed Aliquippa High School among 47 Pennsylvania schools and 1700 nationwide high schools with high drop out rates.
College remediation - According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, '"47% of Aliquippa School District graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses", in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education schools or the community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years. Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates, who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges, takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.
Dual enrollment.
The high school offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. For the 2009-10 funding year, the school district received a state grant of $5,414 for the program.
SAT scores.
From January to June 2011 45 Aliquippa School District students took the SAT exams. The district's Verbal Average Score was 371. The Math average score was 382. The Writing average score was 338. Pennsylvania ranked 40th among states with SAT scores: Verbal - 493, Math - 501, Writing - 479. In the United States 1.65 million students took the exam in 2011. They averaged 497 (out of 800) verbal, 514 math and 489 in writing.
Junior high school.
In 2009 the district built a new building which houses both a junior and senior high school. In 2009, Aliquippa Middle School was in Corrective Action II 2nd Year due to chronically low academic achievement of the students.
Aliquippa Middle School was ranked 138th out of 141 Western Pennsylvania Middle Schools in 2009 by the "Pittsburgh Business Times". The ranking was based on three years of student academic performance on the PSSAs for math, reading, writing and science.
Elementary school.
In 2011, the school declined to School Improvement status due to chronic low student achievement. In 2010 the school was in Warning status. In 2011, the attendance rate was 93%.

Preschool.
Beaver County Head Start has partnered with Aliquippa School District to provide Head Start and Early intervention programming to resident children (ages of 3 and 5 years) for 5 days a week, five hours a day.
Special education.
In December 2010, the district administration reported that 246 pupils or 20% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 231 pupils or 20.3% of the district's pupils received special education services. 
In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department.
In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district’s students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student’s needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts, like Aliquippa School District, have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. 
Aliquippa School District received a $1,074,119 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.
Budget.
In 2007, the Aliquippa School District employed 115 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $50,236 for 180 days worked.
The district administrative costs per pupil in 2008 were $1126 per pupil. The district ranked 34th of Pennsylvania's 500 school districts for administrative costs. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association keeps statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. According to the association, the average salary for a superintendent for the 2007-08 school year was $122,165. Superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the district's teachers' union.
In 2008 the district administration reported that per pupil spending was $17,687 which ranked 26th among Pennsylvania's 501 school districts. In 2010 the per pupil spending had decreased to $16,701.33 Among the states, Pennsylvania’s total per pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008-09. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was $12,759.
Reserves - In 2008, the district reported an unreserved designated fund balance of zero and an unreserved-undesignated fund balance of $1,248,657.00. In 2010, Aliquippa School Administration reported $336,414 in the unreserved-undesignated fund balance. Pennsylvania school district reserve funds are divided into two categories – designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.
In December 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. The audit found that one teacher was assigned to a position without proper certification. Information pertaining to the questionable certificates was submitted to the PDE's Bureau of School Leadership and Teacher Quality. The findings were reported to the school board and administration.
The district is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax regardless of the individual's wealth.
State basic education funding.
In 2011-12, Aliquippa School District received $7,977,273 in state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the district received $150,154 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010-2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 887 students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income, in the 2010–11 school year.
For the 2010-11 school year, Aliquippa School District received a 2.04% increase in state Basic Education Funding resulting in a $8,303,126 payment. Midland Borough School District received a 7.57% increase, which was the highest increase in BEF in Beaver County. Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County received the highest increase in the state at 23.65% increase in funding for the 2010-11 school year. One hundred fifty school districts received the base 2% increase in 2010-11. The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by then Governor Edward Rendell and the Pennsylvania Secretary of Education, Gerald Zahorchak through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year.
In the 2009-2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided Aliquippa School District a 2% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $8,136,818.

Rendell and the Secretary of Education through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year.
Accountability Block Grants.
Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania’s school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the Aliquippa School District applied for and received $407,557 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide full-day kindergarten for the 7th year and for extensive teacher training programs.
Classrooms for the Future grant.
The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math), along with other specialized equipment and provided funding for teacher training to optimize the use of the computers. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Aliquippa School District did not apply for funding in 2006-07. The Aliquippa School District received $83,935 in 2007-08 and was given $45,413 for the 2008-09 school year.
Education Assistance grant.
Aliquippa School Administration applied for the state's Education Assistance Grant. The district received $134,120. The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code.
Literacy grant.
Aliquippa School District was awarded a $1 million competitive literacy grant. It is to be used to improve reading skills kindergarten through 12th grade. The district was required to develop a lengthly plan which included outreach into the community. The funds come from a Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, also referred to as the Keystones to Opportunity grant It is a five-year, competitive federal grant program designed to assist local education agencies in developing and implementing local comprehensive literacy plans. Of the 329 pre-applications by school districts reviewed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, Aliquippa School District was one of only 148 entities that were invited to submit a full application. The funds must be used for teacher training, student screening and assessment, targeted interventions for students reading below grade level and research-based methods of improving classroom instruction and practice. Pennsylvania was among six other states, out of the 35 that applied, to be awarded funding. Pennsylvania received $38 million through the federal program. The Department of Education reserved 5% of the grant for administration costs at the state level.
Federal Stimulus grant.
The district received an extra $1,716,512 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009-10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software.
Race to the Top.
School district officials applied for the Race to the Top federal grant. The district is identified as a turnaround district due to the chronically low academic achievement of its students. When approved for the grant, the district will receive hundreds of thousands of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Turnaround status also brings an extra $700 per student, in supplemental funding above the basic grant amount. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. According to then Governor Rendell, failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.
Common Cents state initiative.
The Aliquippa School District School Board chose to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes.
Real estate taxes.
The Aliquippa School Board set property tax rates, in 2011-2012, at 32.5000 mills for buildings and 202.0000 mills for land. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.
Act 1 Adjusted index.
The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise taxes above that index, unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. With the 2011 state education budget, the General Assembly voted to end most of the Act 1 exceptions leaving only special education costs and pension costs. The cost of construction projects will go to the voters for approval via ballot referendum.
The School District Adjusted Index for the Aliquippa School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012.
For the 2011-12 school year, the Aliquippa School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the Aliquippa School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.
According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district’s index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction.
Aliquippa School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budgets in 2009-10 nor in 2010-11. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.
Property tax relief.
In 2010, the relief was set at $356 for 2,101 approved homesteads and farmsteads. This was the highest relief provided among Beaver County school districts. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Aliquippa School District was $357 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 2,100 property owners applied for the tax relief. The highest property tax relief, among Pennsylvania school districts, went to the residents of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County who received $632 per approved homestead. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Beaver County, 64% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009.
Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, so that people with income of far more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.
Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).
Consolidation of the School District.
The Class of 2009 was the final graduating class for the current Aliquippa High School. Beginning with the 2009/2010 school year, the current Aliquippa Middle School will become the Aliquippa Jr/Sr High School, which will house all current grades served by the existing middle and high school.
Wellness policy.
Aliquippa School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 - Policy 246. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) "shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006." The Superintendent is required to report annually to the Board regarding this policy and the associated issues.
The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.
The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval.
Extracurriculars.
The students have access to a widevariety of clubs, activities and sports. The Aliquippa School Board determines eligibility policies to participate in these programs.
By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

Near to the Wild Heart

Near to the Wild Heart ("Perto do coração selvagem") is Clarice Lispector's first novel, written from March to November 1942 and published around her twenty-third birthday in December 1943. The novel, written in a stream-of-consciousness style reminiscent of the English-language Modernists, centers around the childhood and early adulthood of a character named Joana, who bears strong resemblance to her author: ""Madame Bovary, c'est moi"", Lispector said, quoting Flaubert, when asked about the similarities. The book, particularly its revolutionary language, brought its young, unknown creator to great prominence in Brazilian letters and earned her the prestigious Graça Aranha Prize. 
It has been translated into English twice, the first by Giovanni Pontiero in 1990, and again by Alison Entrekin in 2012.
Background and publication.
When Lispector began writing, in March 1942, she was still a law student at the Faculdade Nacional de Direito ("National Law School"), and was also working as a journalist. In February, she had transferred to the newspaper A Noite ("The Night"), once one of the glories of Brazilian journalism but by then under the direction of the dictatorial Getúlio Vargas government. She had published some stories and journalism, and turned to one of her colleagues, Francisco de Assis Barbosa, for help with the novel she had begun writing. She pieced the book together by jotting down her ideas in a notebook whenever they occurred to her. To concentrate, she quit the tiny maid’s room in the apartment she shared with her sisters and brother-in-law and spent a month in a nearby boardinghouse, where she worked intensely. At length the book took shape, but she feared it was more a pile of notes than a full-fledged novel. Her great friend Lúcio Cardoso, a slightly older novelist, assured her that the fragments were a book in themselves. Barbosa read the originals chapter by chapter, but Clarice vividly rejected his occasional suggestions: “When I reread what I’ve written,” she told him, “I feel like I’m swallowing my own vomit.” 
Cardoso suggested a title, borrowed from James Joyce’s "Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man": “He was alone. He was unheeded, happy, and near to the wild heart of life.” This became the book’s epigraph, which, together with the occasional use of the stream-of-consciousness method, led certain critics to describe the book as “Joycean.” The comparison annoyed Lispector, who had not read Joyce; instead, the book bears the much more distinctive mark of Spinoza, whom she had been reading at the time she wrote it.
Barbosa, who together with Cardoso was one of the book’s first readers, recalled his amazement. “As I devoured the chapters the author was typing, it slowly dawned on me that this was an extraordinary literary revelation,” Barbosa said. “The excitement of Clarice, hurricane Clarice.” He steered it to the book-publishing wing of their employer, A Noite, where it appeared with a bright pink cover, typical for books by women, in December 1943. It was not a lucrative arrangement for the new author. “I didn’t have to pay anything have it published, but I didn’t make any money either. If there was any profit, they kept it,” Lispector said. A thousand copies were printed; in lieu of payment, she got to keep a hundred. As soon as the book was ready, she began sending the book out to critics.
Plot summary.
"Near to the Wild Heart" does not have a conventional narrative plot. It instead recounts flashes from the life of Joana, between her present, as a young woman, and her early childhood. These focus, like most of Lispector's works, on interior, emotional states.
The book opens with a scene of the child Joana playing in the garden, making up poems for her father. Joana's wildness and barely suppressed violence, along with her linguistic creativity, are her most notable features. She is frequently compared to animals: over the course of the book Lispector describes her to a bird, a snake, a wildcat, a horse, and a dog. She commits transgressive acts—as a child she throws a book at an old man's head, for example, and as a married woman she leaves her husband, Otávio, and greets the news of his adultery—he has made another woman, his old friend Lídia, pregnant—with utter indifference. She is not so much immoral as she is amoral: “Evil is not living, and that’s it. Dying is already something else. Dying is different from good and evil.” In the book, she cites long passages from Spinoza, the longest quotes that appear anywhere in her novels; it seems that she felt an affinity with the Dutch philosopher's amoral conception of the world.
Literary significance and criticism.
"Near to the Wild Heart" was greeted as a revolution in Brazilian literature, though it was very rarely compared to the work of any Brazilian writer. Critics mentioned James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Katherine Mansfield, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Marcel Proust, André Gide, and Charles Morgan. The reason seems to be that its language sounded completely un-Brazilian, as the poet Lêdo Ivo wrote: “Clarice Lispector was a foreigner. … The foreignness of her prose is one of the most overwhelming facts of our literary history, and even of the history of our language.”
I met Clarice Lispector at the exact moment that she published "Near to the Wild Heart". The meeting took place in a restaurant in Cinelândia. We had lunch and our conversation strayed from literary matters. … The least I can say is that she was stunning. It was autumn, the leaves in the square were falling, and the grayness of the day helped underscore the beauty and luminosity of Clarice Lispector. Alongside the foreign climate was that strange voice, the guttural diction which rings in my ears to this day.
At the time, Ivo called it "the greatest novel a woman had ever written in the Portuguese language". Other reviews were as enthusiastic. For almost a year after publication, articles about the book appeared continuously in every major city in Brazil. “The whole book is a miracle of balance, perfectly engineered,” combining the “intellectual lucidity of the characters of Dostoevsky with the purity of a child.” A Manhã ("The Morning"), not going quite as far as Lêdo Ivo, had declared it to be “the greatest debut novel a woman had written in all of Brazilian literature.”
Awards and nominations.
In October 1944, the book won the prestigious Graça Aranha Prize ("Prêmio Graça Aranha") for the best debut novel of 1943. The prize was a confirmation of what the "Folha Carioca" had discovered earlier that year when it asked its readers to elect the best novel of 1943. "Near to the Wild Heart" won with 457 votes: a spectacular number, considering that only nine hundred copies had actually been put on sale.

Beatrice of Naples

Beatrice of Naples (16 November 1457 – 23 September 1508), also known as Beatrice of Aragon (; ), was the daughter of Ferdinand I of Naples and Isabella of Taranto. She was twice Queen of Hungary and of Bohemia, having married both Matthias Corvinus and Vladislaus II.
Biography.
Beatrice received a good education at her father's court in Naples. 
She was engaged in 1474 and married Matthias in Hungary 22 December 1476: she was crowned Queen of Hungary in Székesfehérvár.
The marriage secured an alliance between Hungary and Naples: In 1480, when an Ottoman fleet seized Otranto in the Kingdom of Naples, at the earnest solicitation of the pope he sent the Hungarian general, Balázs Magyar, to recover the fortress, which surrendered to him on 10 May 1481. Again in 1488, Matthias took Ancona under his protection for a while, occupying it with a Hungarian garrison. Beatrice exerted some influence in the policy of Hungary. She also had a cultural importance by introducing the Italian renaissance into the court of Hungary, an interest she shared with Matthew: she encouraged his work with the Bibliotheca Corviniana, build the palace Visegrád as a residence for the court, and created an Academy. She wished to participate in policy: in 1477, she accompanied Matthew during the invasion of Austria, and in 1479, she was present during the peace treaty between Matthew and Vladislaus II. 
In 1479, their relationship became tense when Matthew awarded his illegitimate son John (János) Corvinus with a fief and invited John's mother to court. Matthias died before Beatrice ever conceded that his son János, who is the son of Barbara Edelpock, should be the rightful heir. Upon his death in 1490, Beatrice managed to keep a power position by the support of the Hungarian nobility and continue as queen of Hungary by marriage to the next monarch. After the death of Matthias Corvinus, she wrote a letter to Simon Keglevich, she addressed this letter to "king" Simon Keglevich, then only the commander of Matthias Corvinus. She offered him in this letter to become as a mother to his children. He declined this offer, he delivered this letter to the parliament, and he became the ambassador of the parliament to the king. She presided as a royal representative at the parliament where the next king was elected, with the Hungarian crown placed at her side. It is believed she could not control Janos and was claimed illegitimate by her second husband but these claims all cannot be verified nor can they be completely ignored.
Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary wrote in the same year 1490 many letters with the same text to many of the Hungarian nobility. He wrote that Beatrice had written to him, that Matthias Corvinus and Beatrice had decided, that Stephen Zápolya, the father of John Zápolya, should become the next duke of Austria after Matthias Corvinus.
Beatrice married her second husband, Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary in 1491. Beatrice had great support by the Hungarian nobility, and the nobility had demanded of Vladislav that he marry her. This marriage was yet again childless. Formally, the marriage was questioned, as her spouse was not granted as divorce from his first wife by the pope. Her husband claimed, that he did not regard the marriage as legal, and that he had been forced to marry her against his will, and in 1493, a commission was issued to investigate. In 1500, the pope declared the marriage to be illegal, and Beatrice was forced to pay the costs of the trial. Beatrice returned to Naples, where she arrived in 1501, and in 1502, Vladislaus could marry Anne of Foix-Candale. Beatrice died in Naples.

All I Want for Christmas Is You (Vince Vance &amp; The Valiants song)

"All I Want for Christmas Is You" is a Christmas song recorded by American novelty act Vince Vance & The Valiants. Initially released as a single in 1989, Vince Vance's version of the song has charted several times on the "Billboard" country singles charts. It is the most-played Christmas song on country radio, as well as Vince Vance & the Valiants' only chart entry.
Content.
"All I Want for Christmas Is You" is a mid-tempo in triple meter, featuring lead vocals from Lisa Layne. In it, the female narrator, singer Lisa Layne, explains that she does not want Christmas decorations, or gifts from Santa Claus. Instead, all she wants for Christmas is her lover. The melody used in the song is based on Bobby Vinton's number 9 pop hit single from early 1964, "My Heart Belongs to Only You", with a few minor alterations.
Reception.
In his review of the album "All I Want for Christmas Is You", Allmusic reviewer Jason Birchmeier referred to the song as a "holiday favorite within the country community during the '90s" but noted that the rest of the album was not "remotely worth bothering with". Having received frequent rotation on country radio and adult contemporary radio during the Christmas season since its 1993 re-release, "All I Want for Christmas Is You" is also the most-played country music Christmas song.
The song was also made into a music video, directed by Steve Dunning.
Chart performance.
The song first charted in early 1994 based on airplay from the 1993 Christmas season, peaking at #55 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts on the chart week of January 8, 1994. It re-entered in December 1994, reaching a new peak of #52 on the chart week of January 7, 1995. The song re-entered the country charts again every January afterward (except for 1999), with its last Hot Country Singles & Tracks entry being in January 2000. Although it never charted on the country charts again, it peaked at #23 on the Hot 100 Recurrent Airplay chart in 2002 (despite having never entered the Billboard Hot 100 or Hot 100 Airplay charts), and has re-appeared on the Hot Country Recurrents chart every Christmas since late 2000-early 2001.

Charles Douglas Fox

Sir (Charles) Douglas Fox (14 May 1840 – 13 November 1921) was an English civil engineer.
Early life.
Douglas was born in Smethwick, Staffordshire, the oldest son of Sir Charles Fox and had two brothers and a sister. Sir Charles was a civil engineer and had designed, amongst other things, The Crystal Palace in Hyde Park. Douglas was educated at Cholmondeley School, Highgate School from 1851 to 1854 and King's College School from 1854 to 1855. He studied at King's College London from 1855 to 1857 and was to have studied further at Trinity College, Cambridge but the financial collapse of his father's contracting company in 1857 ended his education. Douglas was instead articled to his father who had set up an engineering consultancy, Sir Charles Fox and Sons. 
Douglas was a member of the Church of England and was active in the Church Mission Society as well as being the author of several academic papers. 
He married Mary Wright in 1863 with whom he had one son and four daughters.
Early engineering projects.
In 1863 Douglas was made a partner and by 1865 the firm was involved in major projects in Britain, the USA, Canada, southern Africa, India, Australia, and South America. From 1863 to 1866 Douglas and his father worked on the design of the railway viaducts and bridges at Battersea which would separate the lines coming from Waterloo from those from Victoria. This process also included the widening of Grosvenor Bridge from two to seven tracks.
Military service.
Douglas served as an officer in the Volunteer Force London Rifle Volunteer Brigade and was commissioned as an Ensign in that unit on 17 June 1861. He received promotion to Lieutenant in that unit, since renamed the London Rifle Volunteer Corps, on 18 November 1863. During this period Douglas held several patents including one for "improvements in machinery for nicking and dressing the heads of screw-blanks" which was approved on 28 April 1868, one for "improvements in the manufacture of method of repairing railway rails and other iron in a permanent way and in the machinery to be employed therein" on 30 July 1868 and one for "improvements in screw cutting and threading machines and in the construction of screw nails and spikes" on 30 April 1866. The latter two patents expired after a seven-year period for non-payment of stamp duty required for a patent extension. Douglas was also a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers by 1873.
Douglas Fox & Partners.
The family firm remained solely a father and son enterprise until Sir Charles' death in 1874 upon which Douglas became senior partner of what was now Douglas Fox & Partners. At this stage Douglas' brother Francis also became a partner of the firm. 
Douglas was involved with the construction of the Snowdon Mountain Railway and the extension of the Great Central Railway from Rugby to London including the terminal at Marylebone Station. He worked on several of London's early tube lines including the Great Northern and City tube, the Hampstead tube which linked Charing Cross with Golders Green and Highgate, and the unsuccessful North West London Railway project. Douglas was, with James Greathead, joint engineer of the Liverpool Overhead Railway which was the first electric elevated city railway in the world. 
Further afield Douglas was involved with the design of much of the Cape Colony railways, the whole Rhodesia railway system, which included the 500 ft span Victoria Falls Bridge, the Benguela Railway in Angola, and several railways in South America. The firm were consulting engineers to the Central Argentine Railway; the South Indian Railway; the Southern São Paulo Railway and the Dorada Railway. 
Sir Ralph Freeman, one of the firm's chief engineers, most notably worked on the Victoria Falls Bridge (1905) and the Sydney Harbour Bridge (1932). Freeman rose to become senior partner, and in 1938 the firm changed its name to Freeman Fox & Partners, and later Acer Freeman Fox. Following several mergers, the firm is now part of Hyder Consulting.
Honours and awards.
On 8 March 1886 Douglas was knighted at Windsor Castle by Queen Victoria for his work with James Brunlees on the Mersey Railway Tunnel and a railway linking Birkenhead with Liverpool.
In 1887 he was made an honorary fellow of his alma mater, King's College London and from November 1899 to November 1900 served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers.
Death.
He died on 13 November 1921 in Kensington, at the home of one of his daughters; Mary had died the year before. 
The firm became Freeman, Fox and Partners in 1938 after Ralph Freeman, who had worked for the firm since 1901, became a partner. In 1988 it became Acer Freeman Fox and is now known as Hyder Consulting.

Friday Night Lights (season 3)

The third season of the American serial drama television series "Friday Night Lights" began airing in the United States and Canada on October 1, 2008. It was the first season to be aired on DirecTV's The 101 Network. The 13-episode season concluded on The 101 Network on January 14, 2009 and then began its run on NBC two nights later on January 16, 2009. The show was renewed for two more seasons in March 2009, with both seasons airing in the same format as season 3, containing 13 episodes each.
The season continued to focus around the Dillon Panthers and the pressures faced on and off the field. This season also saw four main characters leave the show by season's end.
Cast.
Unlike the previous two seasons, only eight of ten major roles received star billing in the opening credits. Kyle Chandler portrayed Eric Taylor, head coach of the Dillon Panthers. Connie Britton played Tami Taylor, wife of Eric and new principal of Dillon High School. Zach Gilford played quarterback Matt Saracen. Minka Kelly played Lyla Garrity, now girlfriend of Tim Riggins, fullback and resident bad boy, portrayed by Taylor Kitsch. Adrianne Palicki played Tyra Collette. Jesse Plemons played Landry Clarke, not-quite boyfriend to Tyra and Saracen's best friend. Aimee Teegarden played Julie Taylor, daughter of Eric and Tami.
Supporting characters include: Brad Leland as Lyla's father and head of the Dillon Panthers Booster Club Buddy Garrity, Derek Phillips as Tim's brother Billy Riggins, Louanne Stephens as Saracen's grandmother Lorraine Saracen, Liz Mikel as Smash's mother Corrina Williams, Dana Wheeler-Nicholson as Tyra's mother Angela Collette, Stacey Oristano as Tyra's sister and Billy Riggins' fiance Mindy Collette, and Kevin Rankin as Herc.
Gaius Charles and Scott Porter were billed as guest stars during their 4-episode run as both Brian "Smash" Williams and Jason Street left the show.
New characters first introduced this season include: The McCoy Family (D.W. Moffett as father Joe, Janine Turner as mother Katie, and Jeremy Sumpter as son J.D., a quarterback for the Panthers) and Kim Dickens as Shelby Garrett, estranged mother of Matt Saracen.
Season synopsis.
The season began with Coach Taylor having failed to lead the Panthers to another State championship the year before, creating new pressure for him. Quarterback Matt Saracen's position is threatened by the arrival of freshman J.D. McCoy, an amazing natural talent who comes from a rich family with an overbearing father, Joe. Matt moves to wide receiver after Taylor names J.D McCoy the starting quarterback, but Matt is pushed back into his former role in the playoffs. He and Julie reconcile and rekindle their romance.
Smash Williams, who injured his knee during the previous year's playoffs, rediscovers his love for the game, gets a tryout with a college, and succeeds in winning a spot on their team. Tyra starts dating a cowboy named Cash, leading to complications in her relationship with Landry. Tim and Lyla start dating, and Tim pursues a college football scholarship. Billy Riggins gets engaged to Tyra's older sister Mindy. He, Tim, Herc, and Jason decide to flip Buddy Garrity's house for a profit. Jason Street eventually finds a job at a sports agency in New York City and moves to the northeast to be close to his girlfriend and newborn baby. Tami Taylor becomes the principal of Dillon High School and fights with Buddy Garrity about the allocation of funds toward a Jumbotron.
While Eric Taylor and Buddy Garrity were making a visit to a possible recruit who just moved into town, the coach learns of a plot to have him replaced as head coach of the Dillon Panthers. They learn that Joe McCoy wants Taylor replaced with Wade Aikman, J.D.'s personal coach. After the school's administration meets to decide who gets the coaching job, Aikman is offered the job at Dillon High School, while Taylor is offered the job of coaching the Lions of East Dillon High, which is reopening after years of being closed.
Continuity.
With the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike cutting the second season in half, there is a longer story gap between the end of season two and the beginning of season three than occurred between the other seasons of "Friday Night Lights". Some plots are quickly summarized, others are never again mentioned. Lyla's relationship with Chris and her devout Christianity are absent from Season 3. She is now living with her father and in a relationship with Tim Riggins. Santiago, the street kid who was taken in by Lyla's father is evidently no longer living there and is not seen or mentioned. Landry and Tyra have dated and are now broken up. Smash Williams was seriously injured in a playoff game the preceding season and as a consequence has lost his college football scholarship. He is now a manager at the Alamo 
freeze fast food restaurant. Playing without him, the Dillon football team fell apart and failed to win the state championship. Jason Street was last seen in Season 2 trying to convince Erin, a girl with whom he had had a one-night stand, not to get an abortion. We see that Erin has had the child, but the couple is not living together. Tami Taylor is now the Dillon High School principal.

Redencion 911

Redencion 911 (band) ("Redencion Nueve Once, Redencion 9-11 or Redencion 9.11") was a left wing hardcore punk band from Santiago, Chile.
History.
Redencion 911 performed together between 1997 and 2002. Redencion 911 began in 1997 after the demise of Santiago based hardcore punk bands Octopus and SND (Sin Nombre Definido). The members of Redencion 911 had all been participants in the early Santiago Hardcore scene, Patricio (drums) played drums in the final line up of Golpe Decisivo (who some say was Chile’s first bona fide hardcore band). They were part of a small hardcore punk scene together with other contemporary bands like Silencio Abosoluto, Disturbio Menor, Alternocio, Donfango, Enfermos Terminales, Asunto and Fuerza de Voluntad.
The band's name Redencion 911 is a reference to the 1973 Chilean coup d'état in which the democratically-elected government of Salvador Allende was overthrown by a U.S.- backed military Junta. Throughout their existence, Redencion 911 was openly critical, both through their lyrics and commentary during concerts, of the military dictatorship and the influence of Chile's center-right and right wing political parties as well as the conservative wing of the Catholic Church. One of the more politicized of the bands within the hardcore scene, Redencion 911 was influenced by U.S. hardcore bands such as Minor Threat, Born Against, His Hero is Gone and Fugazi 
Redencion 9-11 played mostly in Santiago and other Chilean cities such as Valparaiso, Chillan, Concepción as well as brief tours to Argentina.
Redencion 911 recorded two tape demos (on in 1997, the other in 1999), one split cassette/CD with 720 from Argentina on AMP Records (1998), a split demo cassette with Marcel Duchamp on Masapunk (2000) and a full length CD and 7”ep through Masapunk and Amor y Lucha (Washington, DC) in 2001, this was their final recording.
Before breaking up in 2002, Redencion 911 toured the East Coast of the USA in the Winter of 2001 sharing the stage with bands like 1905, Kill the Man Who Questions, Zegota (band), Del Cielo, Crispus Attucks, The Paper Chase (band), Iron Lung, and many more. After the breakup, members of Redencion 911 went on to play in Nevski, Illuminati and Birds and Wires.
Redencion 911 was featured in Maximumrocknroll issues #224 Jan 2002 (interview) and #230 July 2002 (tour diary).

West Park Hospital, Epsom

West Park Hospital (sometimes erroneously referred to as West Park Asylum) was a large psychiatric hospital in Epsom, Surrey.
Name.
The hospital seems to have been so-called because of its location to the west of the landscaped parkland formerly associated with Horton Manor (later the Manor Hospital). Although sometimes called an 'asylum' by urban explorers and the media, West Park was never officially termed as such, having opened as West Park Mental Hospital in 1923. The term had largely fallen out of favour by the 1920s and was made obsolete in law by the Mental Treatment Act 1930.
Design and construction.
The hospital was designed by William C. Clifford-Smith (architect to the London County Council), who was also involved in the design of nearby St Ebba's and The Manor Hospitals. The hospital had been in planning since 1906, and by 1917 it was largely complete; however, the outbreak of war postponed opening until 1921. The hospital was the last great London mental hospital, and the last of the Epsom Cluster, a group of five mental institutions on the Horton Estate to the west of Epsom (the others being Horton, Manor, Long Grove and St Ebba's.) The hospital follows the compact arrow design, with external villas.
Operation.
When complete the hospital could cater for around 2,000 patients of mixed class. The site had extensive boiler houses and plant rooms, a large laundry and a substantial water tower. There were also large kitchens located behind the canteen and a substantial recreation hall or ballroom (the latter suffered an arson attack on September 30, 2003 and is now a burnt out shell). The hospital was also once served by the Horton Estate's own railway but this was removed in 1950 and no trace remains except around the central engineering block. The main stores and sewing rooms were located in the central block, but other service buildings such as the mortuary and chapel were located by the entrance road along with some staff housing.
Decline.
The hospital was slowly run down from the mid-1990s, and by 2003 most of the hospital was closed and derelict, although some buildings, including the New Epsom and Ewell Cottage Hospital. remain in use by NHS healthcare services. Because of its derelict state, it came to be of interest to urban explorers who were attracted by the sheer size of the buildings and also the many hospital items still in situ, such as beds, kitchen equipment and personal items. A padded cell also remained in-situ and was of considerable interest to explorers.
Redevelopment.
In November 2010, demolition began of the former hospital buildings. As of April 2011, most of the central buildings had been cleared with only a limited number of wards, the water tower and administration building being retained for conversion to apartments. These are to be incorporated into Noble Park, a new housing development which is currently being built on the site.

Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library

The Columbia University's Rare Book & Manuscript Library is located on the 6th Floor of Columbia University's Butler Library. The library holds the special collections of Columbia University, as well as the Columbia University Archives. The range of the library's holdings spans more than 4,000 years, from cylinder seals created in Mesopotamia to contemporary artists' books. In addition to printed and manuscript resources, the library contains cuneiform tablets, papyri, ostraca, astronomical and mathematical instruments, maps, works of art, photographs, posters, early printing presses and papermaking equipment, type specimens, sound and moving image recordings, theater set models, puppets, masks, ephemera and memorabilia. The Rare Book and Manuscript Library includes unique and rare materials related to all subject areas.
History.
The history of the rare book and manuscript collections dates from the founding of King's College, now Columbia University, in 1754. The library holds materials related to both the first and third presidents of the University, Samuel Johnson and his son William Samuel Johnson, donated by the family in 1914. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the University acquired significant materials though gifts from Stephen Whitney Phoenix, Richard J. H. Gottheil, Brander Matthews, Robert H. Montgomery, David Eugene Smith, and George Plimpton. These gifts included medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, materials related to the history of accountancy, education, and mathematics, and the Dramatic Museum collections. The University’s first major collection purchase was Professor Edwin R. A. Seligman’s library on the history of economics in 1929. This purchase, and the creation of the Friends of the Libraries Group in the late 1920s, was the impetus for growth in the 1930s. The University moved to make provisions for the care of these types of materials, and the Trustees allowed for the establishment of the Rare Book Department on July 1, 1930. By the end of the 1930s, the library was housed on the sixth floor of Butler Library. As the library increased its collecting of archives and manuscripts, the name of the division was changed from the Rare Book Department to the Department of Special Collections in 1946. Its current name was adopted in 1975.
Although many of these collections contained significant manuscripts, the collecting of manuscripts and archives in their own right took on greater importance after World War II. The library acquired several significant manuscript collections in the 1930s and 1940s, including those of editor Park Benjamin and author Stephen Crane. This work continued into the 1950s, during which time the library acquired significant collections related to American history and diplomacy, including those of John Jay. Over the years, the library has acquired archival materials in several key collecting areas—economics and banking, graphic arts, history, human rights, literature, performing arts, printing history, and publishing. In addition, the library includes a number of separately curated archival units, such as the Carnegie Philanthropy Collections, the Bakhmeteff Archive of Russian and East European Culture, and the Herbert H. Lehman American History Collections.
Holdings.
The library’s collections are particularly strong in English and American history and literature, children's literature, economics and banking, education, graphic arts, human rights, journalism history, librarianship, mathematics and astronomy, New York City politics, philanthropy, printing history, social welfare and social work, theater history, and the performing arts.
Units.
The Rare Book & Manuscript Library has eleven units:
Columbia University Archives.
These are located within the Rare Book & Manuscript Library on the 6th floor of Butler Library; they collect, preserve, and make available for research the administrative records of Columbia University, as well as personal papers, publications, and memorabilia related to the University’s history. 
Archival holdings date from the 18th through the early 21st centuries and document the evolution of University governance and administration; the history and development of individual schools, colleges, and academic departments; the professionalization of higher education and the development of academic disciplines; curriculum development, including the formation of the Core Curriculum; the careers of noteworthy faculty and officers; the design and construction of the Morningside campus; and the University’s relationships with city, state, and federal governments. Administrative records available for research in 2007 are those that were created prior to 1982. In addition the UA retains University publications from bulletins to yearbooks; a library of books and pamphlets on Columbia’s history; scrapbooks and memorabilia; in excess of 60,000 images, as well as some 50,000 negatives (both glass plate and film); a collection of lantern slides; and biographical information on students, faculty, and alumni.

Helen Harrison-Bristol

Helen Harrison-Bristol (December 7, 1909 - April 27, 1995) was a pioneering Canadian female civil aviation instructor and the first Canadian Air Transport Auxiliary ferry pilot during Second World War.
Early years.
Helen Marcelle Harrison Bristol was born in Vancouver, British Columbia on December 7, 1909 and educated in England and Belgium. Whilst still a child she was sent to St Mary’s School in Calne, Wiltshire, England. During her residence in Eastbourne, she went on her first flight and decided to become a pilot. She secretly took flying lessons until she received her A licence in 1935. While visiting Singapore, she qualified for her seaplane rating. She obtained her B licence at the London Aeroplane Club in April 1936 and in October qualified for her instructor’s rating. Soon afterwards, she moved to South Africa and settled in Somerset West. She acquired additional instruction at Johannesburg, South Africa before returning to England in 1935 to qualify for a commercial pilot's license. Her total commitment to aviation was made in 1936 when she became one of the first women pilots to receive an instructor's rating in England, and promptly returned to South Africa.
As the first woman to hold a commercial pilot and instructor's rating in that country, she taught at the Cape Town Flying Club and demonstrated such ability that the Royal South African Air Force (RSAAF) offered her an instructor's course on military aircraft at Pretoria. Her outstanding abilities were then retained by the RSAAF to train reserve air force pilots. During this period she also qualified for the South African commercial pilot's certificate as well as instructor and instrument ratings. Until 1938 when she returned to England, her skills were employed by Central Airways at Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth.
In 1939 she was appointed chief flying instructor at the Sheffield Aero Club, then journeyed to the United States to earn that country's commercial pilot's certificate. Still upgrading her qualifications, she travelled to Hamilton, Ontario and earned her Canadian commercial pilot's license and class two instructor's rating. Cub Aircraft Company at Hamilton hired her as an instructor, and within a year she was named test pilot and chief flying instructor.
Helen had a number of surnames. According to her divorce record in South Africa, her maiden name was Testemale. This was a divorce from Louis Botha de Waal in 1939. Various sources give her maiden name as Harrison. In April 1935, according to a legal notice published in The Times, London, she was living at 33 Heathurst Road, Sanderstead, Surrey, when she renounced the surname Barnes and stated that she was to be known as Helen Marcelle Harrison. Canada’s Aviation Hall of Fame lists her as Helen Marcelle Harrison Bristol.
Second World War.
Until 1942 her experience was directed towards pilot training at Toronto, London and Kitchener, Ontario when she was accepted as the first Canadian woman ferry pilot to serve in the United Kingdom with the Air Transport Auxiliary(ATA). The following year she co-piloted a Mitchell bomber across the North Atlantic Ocean from Montreal, Quebec to Scotland, and until 1944 she delivered military aircraft within the United Kingdom.
Post-Second World War.
As demonstration pilot for Percival Aircraft Company she flew a single-engined airplane across Canada in 1946. During the next 33 years she held chief flying instructor positions with a number of British Columbia flying services. In 1961 she earned a United States instructor's certificate and until her retirement in 1969, after 34 years as a pilot, she taught floatplane flying in Canada. In 1968 she was awarded the B.C. Aviation Council's Air Safety Trophy, after logging 14,000 hours as pilot-in-command of numerous aircraft types, without injury to passenger or crew.

Codex Chisianus 88

Codex Chisianus 88 (also "Chigianus"; also known as "MS 88"; formerly Chigi Library R. VIII. 45, since 1922 part of the Vatican Library) is a 9th-century biblical manuscript, first edited in 1772.
It contains what was only surviving version of the original Septuagint text of the Book of Daniel until the 1931 discovery of Papyrus 967 (Chester Beatty X, 3rd-century). 
The manuscript purports to be derictly derived from the recension of the Septuagint made by Origen, ca. AD 240.
The content of the so-called Syro-Hexaploar Codex (dated 616/7), which contains a Syriac translation of Origen's recension, has been adduced to corrobate the authenticity of the Greek text of Codex Chisianus.
The Septuagint text of the Book of Daniel had disappeared almost entirely from Greek tradition at the end of the 4th century, being superseded by the revised text of Theodotion

Tudor Rees

(John Thomas) Tudor Rees (1880 – 27 February 1956) was a Welsh lawyer, judge and Liberal politician.
Family and education.
Tudor Rees, as he was usually known, was the son of the late J Rees of Maesteg in Glamorgan. He was educated at the University of Wales. In 1918 he married Dorothy Sidebotham of Bowdon, Cheshire. They had one son and two daughters.
Career.
Rees’ chosen profession was the law. He practised as a solicitor in Cardiff but was later called to the Bar by Gray’s Inn in 1922. In February 1939 he was appointed a County Court judge (Solicitors’ Journal, 1939 p99) and sat at Whitechapel, Bow and at Uxbridge and Brentford County Courts. He also sat as a Justice of the Peace in Surrey and was later Chairman of Surrey Quarter Sessions. He retired from the Bench in 1955.
War service.
At outbreak of the First World War, Rees organised a recruiting campaign. In 1915 he volunteered for the Welch Regiment eventually achieving the rank of Captain and also served in the Machine-Gun Corps.
The Church.
Rees was a devout Anglican who at one time thought about entering the Church. He retained an interest in ecclesiastical matters throughout his life and was a Lay Assessor in the Dioceses of Canterbury and Southwark. He was the author of a short work on disestablishment.
Politics.
Rees first entered Parliamentary politics at the 1918 general election when he was the Liberal candidate at Barnstaple in Devon. He declared he was a supporter of the Lloyd George coalition but so was his Unionist opponent, C S Parker He may have received the Coalition Coupon because he is described in one important and reliable record as a Coalition Liberal but one historian of the Liberal Party believes Rees was one of 29 Liberal candidates denied the coupon. Another source indicates that Rees was denied the coupon but immediately accepted the Coalition Whip on getting into Parliament. At the time of the election Rees stated that his political priorities were the housing question and the reform of the jury system. He won the seat with a majority of 602 votes.
Rees was unable to hold his seat at Barnstaple at the 1922 general election losing narrowly by just 174 votes in a straight fight with the Conservative candidate Basil Peto. However in 1923 when the Liberal Party was united around the question of Free Trade he won the seat back from Peto with a majority of 1,266 in a three-cornered contest including a Labour candidate. In 1924 he lost the seat back to Peto again in a straight fight by 1,195 votes. He did not contest the seat after 1924 or try to get back into the House of Commons for any other constituency.
Rees tended to be on the conservative wing of the Liberal Party. Chris Cook describes Rees as a member of a right-wing coterie of Liberal MPs who could usually be found supporting the Conservatives when the party vote was split during the period of the first Labour government of 1924.
Other public service.
Rees served as Deputy Chairman of the Road and Rail Traffic Appeal Tribunal and was made a Freeman of the City of London in 1921 and of Epsom and Ewell in Surrey in 1954.
Death.
His Honour Judge Tudor Rees died at his home in Tadworth, Surrey aged 75 on 27 February 1956.

Chris Roberts is a librarian in South London, England, and sometime walking tour guide, as he is the proprietor of F and M Walking Tours in London. The stories that Roberts incorporated into his walking tours became the inspiration for his book "Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind the Rhyme". which was first published in November 2003 with a limited print run of 2000 copies. What began as a self-published project in the UK soon attracted worldwide publicity, including coverage in USA Today. It also received some criticism for its speculative nature and lack of scholarship. The book is now widely available as it was re-published by both Gotham Books and Granta.
Roberts has also written "Cross River Traffic" (2005) on the history of bridges over the Thames. "One Eye Grey", a series of penny dreadful booklets for the 21st century is another self-published venture. These contain short stories based on London folklore. In June 2010 he published Football Voodoo — a study of black magic and superstition in the world of football.

Ava Leigh

Hayley Carline (born 22 November 1985), better known as Ava Leigh, is a British reggae singer from Chester, England.
Career.
Leigh's career first began when she started performing with her school's jazz band. In her "mid teens" she acquired a manager, and tried out for a variety of labels, singing R&B. However, Leigh realised that the genre "never, ever worked" for her. Leigh, in an interview with "The Telegraph", attributed her mother for first getting her into reggae:
"How I got into reggae ... was from my mother listening to it. She was a big fan of British reggae sub-genre Lover's Rock. When I was about nine or 10, I remember hearing 'Silly Games' by Janet Kay, with all those high notes, and thinking, 'Hmm, I wonder if I can do that?’"
Leigh worked with writers such as Nick Manasseh, Future Cut and Feng Shui on her debut album, "Turned on Underground". Partly recorded at Harry J's in Jamaica, the album was reviewed favourably and was described as having the "slick appeal of a US R&B princess." Her debut four-track extended play (EP) "La La La" was released on 5 January 2009.
Leigh's song "Mad About the Boy" was featured on the film "Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging", and her version of "Mas Que Nada" was featured in a 2008 TV commercial for chain store Next's summer clothing range. Also in 2008, Leigh co-wrote Joss Stone's digital download single "Governmentalist", featuring rapper Nas.
Leigh has also stated she hopes to become part of a musical movement bringing singers (as opposed to dancehall deejays) back to the forefront in reggae. As she told noted writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning "Blues & Soul": I think the reason we're now living in the decade of dancehall deejays is because everyone these days is so into hip hop and rap, and dancehall is basically the reggae version of that. But hopefully me doing this can help signal the start of many more successful new reggae vocalists to come."

In math, 90% of the students in 3rd through 4th grades were on grade level and 51% scored advanced. In 4th grade science, 91% of the pupils were on grade level.
Special education.
In December 2010, the district administration reported that 377 pupils or 15% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. Of the identified students, 52% had a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 368 pupils or 14% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 54% of them having a specific learning disability.
In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, Hopewell Area School District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department.
In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district’s students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student’s needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.
The Hopewell Area School District received a $1,698,646 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.
In 2009, Hopewell Area School District was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Education for Least Restrictive Environment monitoring. One hundred ninety six schools districts were selected in 2008-09. The district received an alert letter from the PDE - Bureau of Special Education. School districts were placed in one of three categories: Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. The district was placed in Tier 3 due to students spending more than 60% of the school day, outside of regular education. The monitoring is a product of the PDE addressing its voluntary settlement in Gaskin V. Pennsylvania which ordered that special education students spend most of their school day (80%) in regular education classrooms with supplementary aids and services to assist funded by the taxpayers. In 2010, the district was removed from the monitoring list.
Gifted education.
The Hopewell Area School District Administration reported that 96 or 3.58% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student’s building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.
Wellness policy.
Hopewell Area School Board established a district wellness policy in November 2006. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 – 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) "shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006." The policy calls for annual testing to track student progress on the Health, Safety and Physical Education academic standards. This testing is not required by state or Federal law.
The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, public school districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required all Pennsylvania public school districts to submit a copy of the policy for approval.
Highmark Healthy High 5 grant.
In 2011, Hopewell Area School District received funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant. The District received $9,641 which was used to fund the Inspire Me Fitness Health and Skill-related fitness by working out on the Railyard Program.

Reserves In 2008, Hopewell Area School District reported a balance of $3,500,000 in an unreserved-designated fund. The unreserved-undesignated fund balance was reported as $2,370,764.
In December 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. The findings were reported to the school board and administration.
The Hopewell Area School Board approved a proposed $34.36 million budget for 2012-13 which included a property tax increase despite the District having substantial "rainy day" reserve funds. In accordance with Pennsylvania public school law, the proposed budget was available for public inspection at the district's business office in Hopewell Township.
The district is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual’s personal wealth.
State basic education funding.
In 2011-12, Hopewell Area School District received a $9,313,053 allocation, of state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the School District received $192,417 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010-2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. In 2010, Hopewell Area School District reported that 624 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.
In the 2010-2011 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 5.07% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $10,262,572. Among the districts in Beaver County, the highest increase went to Midland Borough School District which got a 7.57% increase. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where a district received at least the same amount as the year before, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell’s policy to fund some Pennsylvania public school districts at a much greater rate than other public school districts.
In the 2009-2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 4.88% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $10,408,438 to Hopewell Area School District.

According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 562 district students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007–2008 school year.
Accountability Block Grants.
Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania’s school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $437,324 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide full-day kindergarten, to pay teachers to develop new curriculum and course offerings and to increase instructional time.
Classrooms for the Future grant.
The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. The Hopewell Area School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07. In 2007-08, received $205,756. The district received $75,278 in 2008-09 for a total funding of $281,034. In Beaver County, the highest award was given to Freedom Area School District at $476,723. The highest funding state wide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. In 2010, Classrooms for the Future funding was curtailed statewide due to a massive state financial crisis.
Science It’s Elementary grant.
None of the elementary schools in Hopewell Area School District applied to participate and received a Science It’s Elementary grant in 2008-09. In Beaver County, two elementary schools participated. For the 2008-09 school year, the program was offered in 143 schools reaching 2,847 teachers and 66,973 students across Pennsylvania. In 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Education initiated an effort to improve science instruction in the Commonwealth’s public elementary schools. Called Science: It’s Elementary, the program is a hands on instruction approach for elementary science classes that develops problem-solving and critical thinking skills. To encourage schools to adopt the program’s standards aligned curriculum, the state provided a grant to cover the costs of materials and extensive mandatory teacher training. Participating districts were required to develop a three-year implementation plan for the participating school. They had to appoint a district liaison who was paid $3000 by PDE to serve as the conduit of all information between the district and the Department and its agents along with submitting orders and distributing supplies to implementing teachers. For the 2006-07 state education budget, $10 million was allocated. The 2006-07 State Education Budget provided $635 million in new spending for pre-K through 12th grades for the 2006-07 school year. This marks an 8-percent increase over 2005-06 public school funding. The grant program was expanded to $14.5 million in the 2008-09 budget.
Federal Stimulus grant.
The Hopewell Area School District received an extra $3,171,096 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009-10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software.
Race to the Top grant.
District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over one million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.
Common Cents state initiative.
The Hopewell Area School Board elected to participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, Hopewell Area School District School Board was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes.
Real estate taxes.
Property tax rates in 2011-12 were set by the school board at 67.0000 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the respective counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the board were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts.
Act 1 Adjusted Index.
The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school’s share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

For the 2012-13 budget year, Hopewell Area School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit.

For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.
For the 2011-12 school year, the Hopewell Area School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the Hopewell Area School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.
According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district’s index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction.
The Hopewell Area School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011. For 2009-10 school budget, the board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.
Property tax relief.
In 2010, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Hopewell Area School District was $209 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 5,502 property owners applied for the tax relief. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Beaver County, 64% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. In Beaver County, the highest amount of tax relief in 2010, went to property owners in the Big Beaver Falls Area School District, who received $352. The highest property tax relief in Pennsylvania went to the property owners of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County who received $632 per approved homestead. This was the third year they were the top recipient.
Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently, individual with income much more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.
Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).
Extracurriculars.
The district offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy.
By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

List of Forgotten Realms cities

This is a list of fictional cities, towns, and villages from the "Forgotten Realms" setting. These locations have appeared in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for the "Dungeons and Dragons" fantasy roleplaying game, the multiple series of novels set in the Forgotten Realms, or the numerous video and computer games set in the Forgotten Realms, or any combination thereof.
C.
Calimport.
Calimport is a city which sits on the coast of the subcontinent of Faerûn.
The sprawling port-city of Calimport is a city within the country of Calimshan. It is on the water, and the desert, so it has ways of travel by both. Memnon and Manshaka are close trading partners, Manshaka by sea, and Memnon by caravan. But some of the runs that the local traders go as far as Luskan. Sultan Vezhera is King, but the Crime Guilds run the streets. It's all well organized so an outsider wouldn't know the difference. Bead stands, harems, and Taverns line the streets, but as usual there is always a top provider of both. Mystic Tavern, which has an opium den in the back, and the Glistening Harem that has a wondrous bath house.
Calimport also is the home of the assassin Artemis Entreri, known for his longstanding feud with Drizzt Do'Urden in a number of novels by R. A. Salvatore.
Ched Nasad.
Ched Nasad is a drow city.
The City of Shimmering Webs, Ched Nasad, was constructed in a cavern shaped like a cone with the tip pointing downwards. The various levels and the more influential buildings in the city are made out of extra thick spiderweb strands, thus giving the city its name. It was not featured prominently in the Realms until the War of the Spider Queen series, where duergar mercenaries in the employ of the Vhaeraunite group Jaezred Chaulssin, inadverdantly destroyed it through copious use of stonefire bombs, which were much more effective on the webs that held it together than on stone. Out of the 30,000 drow who made up the city's population, around 3,000 survived the disaster.
L.
Luskan.
Luskan (also known as the "City of Sails") is a port city at the mouth of the River Mirar on the northernmost point of the Sword Coast, on the continent of Faerûn. It is considered by most to be the furthest reach of civilization, the Spine of the World Mountains which mark what most believe to be the end of the known world (this is of course not true as the "Ten Towns" of "Icewind Dale" lie past them) being just a couple of hundred miles north of the city.
Built on the ruins of Illusk, which fell in 1244 DR to the orcs of the Bloody Tusks Tribe, Luskan has a very intriguing history. Most of its inhabitants, however, couldn't care less. Luskan is a port town frequented by pirates, thieves and other disreputable folk interested in only one thing: money. Although you could be murdered, mugged or kidnapped at any moment within its walls, Luskan is a very lucrative city. Pirates bring in their booty to be sold to the black market, northern traders frequent the place as a rest stop on their way to the aforementioned Ten towns during the warmer months, ready to buy exotic scrimshander ornaments, several taverns do a roaring trade in ale and other spirits, the drugs and slave trade are rife (although obviously sublimated) and information brokers and prostitutes ply their trade during the night-time.
The city was officially ruled by the five High Captains: Taerl, Baram, Kurth, Suljack and Rethnor, former pirate lords all.
The true power in the city actually resides in the Host Tower of the Arcane. The 130 loosely affiliated mages use the High Captains as puppet rulers, mostly keeping to themselves and working on their own magical experiments. They encourage the harassment of the trading routes of small cities such as Longsaddle, "Mirabar" and Neverwinter although they stay well clear of Waterdeep and Amn's routes. They also encourage local traders to treat travellers with disdain and suspicion, in the possibility that they may be spies for their enemies, often sending agents to follow strangers personally.
Luskan is the main setting of "The Pirate King" novel by R.A. Salvatore.
Other media.
In the game Neverwinter Nights, in the year 1373 DR the High Captains were either killed or forced to flee during a vicious civil war caused by a cultist named Maugrim, who planned on using Luskan's might against the city of Neverwinter.
M.
Melvaunt.
Melvaunt is a city on the northern side of the Moonsea and adjacent to the Great Gray Land of Thar. It is ruled by the "The Lord of Keys".
Mirabar.
Mirabar is the mining center for the Sword Coast, on the continent of Faerûn. The city's Shield Dwarves live underground to oversee their workshops. The humans above cooperate with the Dwarves to handle the mining, move the ore to market and defend the city against magical threats. The nominal ruler of Mirabar is a hereditary marchion, but the true power is in an assembly called the Council of Sparkling Stones, a Dwarven and Human group that meets once a year to determine target production quotas and whether or not to threaten current clients with reduced output.
The city itself stands on a knoll on the north banks of the river Mirar. It is linked by good roads to its major mines in the Spine of the World mountains. These mines yield up almost all known metals and gemstones so they are guarded against Orc and monster raids by a standing army, the axe of Mirabar. The craftsmen of Mirabar also work the stone and metals taken out of the mines, transporting the stone to Luskan magically (for an exorbitant cost) to be shipped to the south, the worthless stone is crushed to improve the city's roads. This means that the city is the richest city north of Waterdeep.
Mulmaster.
Mulmaster is a city on the continent of Faerûn, led by the High Blade (the "de facto" ruler of the city), Selfaril Uoumdolphin. After years of actively opposing it, the city finally joined the Zhentarim. Now firmly entrenched in the Zhents' power base and with a new temple to Bane being erected there, the city that once stood as a bulwark against the spread of the Zhent stain is now one of the proudest jewels in Fzoul Chembryl's new, Banite-influenced Zhentarim.
In fact, Selfaril was murdered by his twin brother, Rassendyl, who now rules in Selfaril's name.
N.
Nesmé.
The small city of Nesmé is built upon the southern bank of the Surbrin River, on the northwestern edge of the Evermoors in northern Faerûn. The city is part of the confederation of the Silver Marches ruled by Lady Alustriel Silverhand. The city has approximately 6,000 permanent residents, but the population may increase up to 50 percent during the trade season.
Because Nesmé is located in the middle of the wilderness, the city faces constant threats. To the north lies the dark woods of Lurkwood. Tribes of Uthgardt barbarians roam the plains north and west of the Surbrin. To the south and east lies the hidden dangers of the Evermoors. As a result, the city has funneled much of its resources into maintaining a viligent defense force called the 'Riders of Nesmé'.
Appearances.
Due to the Riders' commitment to protect the city, they are very suspecious of outsiders. Their wary nature caused them to turn back Drizzt Do'Urden's party in the book, "Streams of Silver". This act would later cause frosty relations between Nesmé and Mithral Hall.
Northkeep.
Northkeep was founded in 348 DR (Year of the Dagger) on an island near the southern shore of the Moonsea, about midway between the present towns of Elventree and Elmwood. The city became a beacon of civilization and a jumping-off point for merchants. The power of Northkeep made it a target for orcs, giants, and other evil beings, who formed the against the city.
Northkeep appeared safe on its island, but in 400 DR (Year of the Blue Shield), a huge force mounted on dragonback swept over the city, while ships landed an army; the city was overrun and sacked. To make their victory complete, a force of nonhuman mages and clerics gathered on the north shore of the Moonsea and brought the vengeance of Gruumsh down upon the ruined city, sinking it beneath the surface of the Moonsea.
The sunken city is reputed to be haunted. A bell, known as the "Bell in the Deep", sits in one of the tallest submerged towers, and at times, people on nearby ships can hear the ghostly bell ring.
S.
Scornubel.
Scornubel (also known as "Caravan City"), located in the Western Heartlands of the subcontinent of Faerûn on the world Toril, is a major tradestop both for caravans heading north and south. Goods of all kinds can be found here virtually year-round. The city is also a hotbed of intrigue. Legitimate lords and those of a more shady kind, rulers of bastions of good, the masters of the Underdark, all come to Scornubel to engage in political actions or exchange secrets that might see their power stripped from them at home.
If you want goods, they can be found in Scornubel. If you want information, it can be found in Scornubel. But there's always a price attached.
Selgaunt.
Selgaunt is a metropolis with over 56,000 inhabitants, and is the largest and one of the wealthiest cities in the merchant nation of Sembia. Its nature is that of a port city located on the northwestern shore of the "Sea of Fallen Stars" at the mouth of the river Arkhen. This was originally a slave city begotten from the shores of western civilization, henceforth known as Selgaunt. The founder of the city of Selgaunt was a poor novelist by the name of Barthoemue Jacobie Rankster from the first age.
The city provides the setting for the novels of "The Sembia Series", the first of which was an anthology of smaller stories, "The Halls of Stormweather", by several authors published in 2000.
Silverymoon.
Silverymoon was ruled for decades by High Lady Alustriel Silverhand, one of the Seven Sisters and also Chosen of Mystra, the goddess of magic. Alustriel stepped down, paving the way for Taern "Thunderspell" Hornblade, who is now leader of the entire confederation. According to the original "Forgotten Realms" boxed set, the name Silverymoon comes from a "divine unicorn" of the same name. Silverymoon became a city in 637 DR, when a stone wall was built around it for the first time and the first ruler of Silverymoon, High Mage Ecamane Truesilver, was elected. The city has a population of 26,000.
W.
Winterkeep.
Winterkeep is one of the biggest (if not "the" biggest) city in the Hordelands, on the continent of Faerûn. Originally a nobleman's estate, it later became the winter palace of the Raumatharan king. Located on the southern side of a bay in Yal-Tengri, it may arguably be compared to real world Saint Petersburg, or a remote Königsberg. It may also be compared to any city bordering the real-world Hudson Bay, albeit it is not located in Anchorome (Toril's equivalent to North America).
East of Winterkeep are the "Glittering Spires", arguably Toril's Urals (except that Urals are actually very low in altitude, barely a mountain range at all).
Z.
Zhentil Keep.
Zhentil Keep is the main base of operation for the Zhentarim. The city was later destroyed by Cyric.

Epsom Cluster

The Epsom Cluster, also referred to as the Horton Estate, was a cluster or group of five large psychiatric hospitals situated on land to the west of Epsom. 
The hospitals were built owned and managed by the London County Council to alleviate pressure on London's existing lunatic asylums, which had by this time become overcrowded.
The cluster comprised:
The Horton Light Railway transported building supplies and then coal and provisions to the hospitals in the cluster. The cluster was served by a central cemetery on the corner of Hook Road and Horton Lane until 1955 and a central waterworks and power station until the arrival of mains services.
Present day.
As of 2011, much of the estate had been redeveloped as housing including most of The Manor and Horton and all of Long Grove. NHS psychiatric units remained operational at St. Ebba's, Horton Haven, West Park and the Manor while redundant areas at West Park, St. Ebba's and Horton were undergoing redevelopment.

William O'Bryen Drury

Rear-Admiral William O'Bryen Drury (died 6 March 1811) was a senior officer of the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars.
Naval career.
Drury served as commander of the ship of the line HMS "Powerful" during the French Revolutionary Wars, during which he was heavily engaged at the Battle of Camperdown, at which a Dutch fleet was destroyed in 1797. In April 1804, Drury was promoted to Rear-Admiral and in 1808 was sent to be commander of the East Indies Station as senior admiral. Drury's command overlapped with that of Albemarle Bertie at the Cape of Good Hope and the two engaged in numerous political struggles, even appointing separate officers to command the same ships to spite one another. In November 1810, Drury was ordered to provide Bertie with a fleet of small transport ships for the Invasion of Île de France, which he accompanied and insisted on command despite orders not to infringe on Bertie's command of the operation. When Bertie was subsequently made a baronet as a reward for the successful conclusion of this operation Drury complained at length about Bertie to the Admiralty. Bertie demanded a court martial on his behaviour, which was dismissed by the Admiralty, who were becoming irritated by Drury and Bertie's squabbling. The issue remained unresolved at Drury's sudden death on 6 March 1811 on station in India.

Kevin Boyce

Kevin L. Boyce (born ca. 1971) is an American politician of the Democratic Party. He currently is a member of the Ohio House of Representatives, serving the 25th District. From 2009-2010, Boyce served as the 47th Ohio State Treasurer. 
Career.
Prior to holding political office, Boyce was the executive director of the KnowledgeWorks Foundation, a nonprofit organization that promotes college access for high school students. He was also the executive director of the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus from 1997 to 1999. He managed Charleta B. Tavares' unsuccessful campaign for Ohio Secretary of State 1998. He was Chief of Staff for the minority caucus of the Ohio House of Representatives from January 1999 to September 2000.
On September 11, 2000, he was appointed to the Columbus, Ohio City Council. He was elected to one of three open Council seats in the November 6, 2001 election and won another four-year Council term on November 8, 2005. On the Council, Boyce ultimately served as President Pro Tem and Chairman of the Finance and Zoning Committees. 
On December 23, 2008, Democratic Governor Ted Strickland announced Boyce's appointment as Ohio State Treasurer, to replace Richard Cordray, who left office in November 2008 to become Ohio Attorney General. On January 8, 2009 Boyce was sworn into office, becoming the first African-American Democrat to hold a statewide, non-judicial office in Ohio. Boyce ran for the Treasurer's position for the first time during the 2010 midterm elections against Republican challenger Josh Mandel. Boyce lost the election with 40.2% of the vote.
Ohio House of Representatives.
When W. Carlton Weddington was indicted in a bribery scandal in early 2012, he resigned his seat, forcing House Democrats to appoint his successor. It was soon after announced that Boyce would be the appointee, chosen over a number of applicants. 
Boyce was sworn into office on May 6, 2012, and currently serves on the committees of Commerce, Labor, and Technology; Financial Institutions, Housing and Urban Development; and the Health and Aging Committee. 
In 2012, Boyce won his first full term in the House with 85.84% of the vote over Republican Seth Golding.
Controversies.
In July 2009, the Dayton Daily News published an article alleging that Boyce had spent $32,469 on promotional items with his name on them. Despite Boyce's arguments that such practices were common for political officeholders and that he had spent 30% less than did his predecessor on such items, Boyce's Republican opponent in the 2010 campaign, state Rep. Josh Mandel, charged that the expenditures were inappropriate given the state's budget difficulties. Boyce also was criticized for hiring Democratic party operatives for several positions within his office.
Boyce was further questioned for awarding a $160,000 per year contract to Key Bank for processing the state's checks. While Ohio had previously processed its own checks for 100 years, Boyce expected that the new contract would save approximately $83,000 per year through increased interest earnings. The contract was awarded in a competitive bid process, but critics questioned it because two Key Bank lobbyists held a $500 per ticket fundraiser for Boyce one week after the contract was awarded.
After losing re-election in 2010, Boyce recommended his top aide, Amer Ahmad, to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel for Comptroller of Chicago, even though Boyce had received federal subpoenas asking about Ahmad's involvement in contracts given to a Boston bank. Ahmad was indicted in August, 2013, charged with eight counts of bribery, wire fraud and conspiracy for his actions as Ohio deputy treasurer under Boyce.
Personal.
Boyce graduated from Columbus East High School in 1990. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Toledo in 1995 and a Master of Public Administration degree from Central Michigan University in 2004. He is married to Crystal Boyce, has two sons and a goddaughter.
Recognition.
The National Council of Negro Women presented Boyce its Community Service Plaque in May 2004. He was honored by the Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity and Leadership, At Its Best, LLC. as an outstanding role model for young men in November 2004.

<doc id="20820474" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20820474" title="CAF 5-Year Ranking">
CAF 5-Year Ranking

The Confederation of African Football football CAF 5-Year Ranking is used to determine the number of clubs that each CAF member association may enter in the region's club competitions. At present, those associations ranked in the top twelve (or tied for twelfth) may enter two sides into each of the two continental tournaments, while the remaining associations are limited to a single side in each competition.
Introduction of the ranking.
Prior to 2004, CAF organised three club tournaments (the CAF Champions League, the African Cup Winners' Cup, and the CAF Cup) with each association allowed to enter a single side in each tournament.
Starting from the 2004 season, the Cup Winners' Cup and CAF Cup were combined into a new tournament, the CAF Confederation Cup. Rather than limiting all associations to just two positions in CAF tournaments, CAF decided to allow the leading nations two entries into the new tournament, and also allow them a second entry in the Champions League.
As with the UEFA ranking used for their club tournaments, the CAF ranking is based on the results obtained in each of the past five completed club seasons (each weighted equally). There are some differences, notably:
The initial ranking system.
The initial classification (for 2004 tournaments) was made according to the performance of the associations in the previous 5 years (1998 to 2002) in club competitions held by the Confederation of African Football.
According to this system the associations selected were Tunisia (36 points), Egypt (31 points), Côte d'Ivoire (27 points), Morocco (24 points), South Africa (17 points), Algeria (17 points), Cameroon (14 points), Ghana (12 points), Angola (12 points), Nigeria (10 points), Congo DR (8 points), and Senegal (6 points).
Season 2005 controversy.
In July 2004 the Confederation of African Football informed its members that the ranking system for admission to the various cups for the 2005 season would be done according to the same 1998-2002 ranking used for the 2004 season. It is unknown why CAF did not calculate a 1999-2003 ranking (following UEFA's practice of updating its rankings each season), as there would seem to have been enough time to do this. Since then, it has become CAF's policy to adopt a year older ranking for the competitions of the new season. So, for the 2012 season, rankings were based on results from 2006 to 2010.
Season 2011 change.
In December 2010 CAF altered the ranking system, removing the components from the Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup, and weighting more recent results more highly. For 2011 competitions, results from seasons 2005 to 2009 were still used, but the points from 2009 were multiplied by 5, from 2008 by 4 and so on. 
Criteria for awarding points.
CAF approved its basic criteria, based on the criteria used in the election of the CAF Clubs of the 20th Century on 2000, for awarding points in 2003. Since then the only change (added in 2005) has been the addition of criteria that rewards clubs that advance to the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup. This methodology has also been used to create an all-time ranking for CAF clubs (adding the points that would have been obtained by each club based on its results since 1965).
The table below shows the years during which the tournament was run (although for the CAF 5-year rankings only results since 1998 have counted). Since 2011 the Super Cup and FIFA World Cup Club have been excluded.

Driver's brake valve

The driver's brake valve is a complicated valve system for controlling the compressed air brake of a railway vehicle. Depending on its setting, it controls whether the brake pipes of a compressed air brake are evacuated and thus whether braking is applied or maintained; or if the brake pipes are connected to a compressed air reservoir, it controls whether the brakes are released again or remain released.
This equipment is found on the footplate of locomotives or in the driver's cab of power cars and driving cars in multiple unit's, hence the name.
In the simplest case the position of the lever controls the extent to which the valve opens, how quickly compressed air can be released from the pipes or the reservoir in the braking system.
The setting of modern driver's brake valves controls the dynamic reduction of the remaining pressure in the brake pipes.

Chromodoris westraliensis

Chromodoris westraliensis is a species of very colourful sea slug, a dorid nudibranch, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Chromodorididae.
Distribution.
This species of nudibranch occurs in coastal regions of Western Australia, from the Kimberley region in the north of the state, to its southern occurrence near Esperance. It is the most abundant nudibranch of the Perth region.
Life habits.
These nudibranchs feed on sponges, usually a single species, storing the toxins the sponge contains, in order to deter their own potential predators.
This species occurs in shallow waters on partially exposed reefs and at depths up to 18 metres.
Description.
The length of this animal is up to 400 millimetres. A mantle covers the upper parts of the animal and extends to form a skirt at the sides. The colouring is two (or one) bright blue patches on a black background, with an orange outline. This aposematic coloration advertises its toxicity to would-be predators.
Two sensory organs, tentacle shaped rhinophores, are orange, and are located at the upper surface of the head. The gills, clustered and plumose, are also orange and arranged near the anus.

James Warren (publisher)

James Warren, born James Warren Taubman (July 29, 1930), is a magazine publisher and founder of Warren Publishing. Magazines published by Warren include "Famous Monsters of Filmland" and the horror-comics magazines "Creepy", "Eerie", and "Vampirella".
Art and architecture.
James Warren was born at Mount Sinai Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. An art student during his grammar school and high school years, he came in second one year in the Pennsylvania State Scholastic Art Competition. He attended the University of Pennsylvania School of Architecture and served in ROTC, leaving his junior year to enlist in the United States Army when the Korean war began. Accepted into Armored Infantry Officers Training, he was deafened six months later during training when he got too close to the .50 caliber heavy machine gun. He was medically discharged a few months later, and did not return to Penn State.
"After Hours" and "Famous Monsters of Filmland.
In the 1950s, Warren worked in advertising as an artist and writer. Inspired by Hugh Hefner's magazine "Playboy", he launched his own men's magazine, "After Hours", which lasted four issues and led to his arrest on charges of obscenity and pornography in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he was based. He recalled in an interview published in 1999:
Through "After Hours", Warren met his future collaborator, Hollywood literary agent Forrest J Ackerman, who submitted the pictorial feature "Girls from Science-Fiction Movies." Following correspondence and telephone calls, they met in person in New York City in late 1957. There, Ackerman showed Warren a horror movie-themed issue of the French magazine "Cinema 57". Recalling his youth seeing black-and-white horror movies in theaters, and realizing many of those movies were playing on television to a new generation of children, he was inspired to launch an accompanying magazine "carefully crafted to spoof the monsters and yet treat them as 'heroes' ... The adults wouldn't buy it, but the kids — those millions of Baby Boomers — would. A few weeks later I was in Forrey Ackerman's living room in California, choosing the photos and article content for a one-shot magazine called "Famous Monsters of Filmland" that went on sale that January with a February 1958 cover date. Warren said it sold out its 200,000 print run within days.
He financed the first issue, for which the upstate New York printer wanted payment upfront, through "some advance money from my distributor," Kable News,
A second issue was published eight months later "because I had to wait until the money came in from the first issue and Kable wouldn't advance it to me," Warren said.
Warren moved to New York City in 1960s, though leaving the Captain Company, the mail-order firm he concurrently founded to sell horror-related items in "Famous Monsters of Filmland", in Philadelphia, where overhead was cheaper. He found a duplex penthouse in midtown Manhattan where he lived on the top floor, using the ground floor living room, dining room, bath and kitchen was Warren Publishing's editorial office. By this time he was publishing, in addition to "Famous Monsters", the magazines "Wildest Westerns", "Spacemen", and the satirical "Help!" During that magazine's five years of publications, the editorial assistants were 
future feminist icon Gloria Steinem followed by future Monty Python's Flying Circus cartoonist Terry Gilliam.
"Creepy".
In the mid-1960s, inspired by the EC Comics of the 1950s, Warren launched the black-and-white horror-comics magazines "Creepy", "Eerie" and "Vampirella". He continued to publish a variety of magazines until the 1980s, when he left the field due to health problems. In 2008, he established a new venture, Jim Warren Publishing.

Rangeview Library District

Rangeview Library District is the public library system serving the residents of Adams County, Colorado, through its seven Anythink libraries located in the communities of Bennett, Brighton, Commerce City, Thornton and the Perl Mack neighborhood in Denver. The library district also offers outreach services through its Bookmobile, Anythink in Motion, visiting area neighborhoods and community stops.
History.
Originally the Adams County Public Library, Rangeview Library District became independent from Adams County in January 2005 and now operates as its own entity, overseen by a five-member Library Board of Trustees appointed by the Adams County Commissioners. ACPL was founded in 1953, and first served county residents solely out of a Bookmobile. The district has grown exponentially in the past 50+ years to its current seven branches, with four new branch buildings designed by Humphries Poli Architects (Denver) as part of its capital construction project.
Anythink.
In September 2009, Rangeview Library District launched its new brand, AnythinkTM. The district changed the names of its community libraries to Anythink libraries as part of the district's branding efforts. The district's new logo includes a "doodle," meant to represent the beginning of all ideas, above the "Anythink" name. The tag line reads "A Revolution of Rangeview Libraries."
Library staff job titles and descriptions changed in July 2009. There are three different job titles in the branch: "wrangler," "concierge" or "guide." Branch managers are now called "Experience experts." All staff who work for the district are referred to as "Anythinkers."
As part of the brand launch, Anythink creative consultants at Ricochet Ideas partnered with Canadian animator Jeff Chiba Stearns to create a short animation where the doodle takes on a life of its own. The animation signifies the many things a doodle can become and the sparks of imagination available to anyone who visits an Anythink library.
Sustainable Practices.
The Rangeview Library District Board of Trustees decided early on that the new libraries built as part of their 2008-2010 capital construction projects would be as sustainable as possible. It was agreed that they would pursue U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED silver certification on three of the four new facilities. The district’s long-term goal is to make all of its libraries carbon-neutral facilities.
The Bennett library, which opened in May 2009, will not be certified. However, the building is highly efficient and sustainable by using local materials like beetle-killed pine for the ceiling and front entrance, Solatubes for natural light, ground-source heating and cooling and recycled materials through most of the facility. A $75,000 grant from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs allowed the district to include a 10 kW photovoltaic system on the library’s roof.
Anythink Brighton, which opened in September 2009, is the most sustainable of the four new buildings in the capital construction project thus far and is considered the first carbon-negative library in the U.S. The facility will operate without emitting pollutants because of renewable energy and carbon credits, including a 108 kW photovoltaic system on the building’s roof that was purchased through a $300,000 matching grant from DOLA. Additionally, the project will offset the emission of an additional 167,620 lbs of CO2 created by other buildings within the Brighton community by producing more renewable energy than it will use. The building is LEED gold certified.
Fine-Free Policy.
As of Feb. 14, 2009, Rangeview Library District does not charge fines for late materials. Library customers receive notification of overdue items and are billed for replacement and processing after 25 days overdue. Borrowing privileges are suspended until materials are returned or the district is compensated for lost materials.
WordThink.
WordThinkTM is a word-based materials classification system developed by Rangeview Library District’s collection development department to replace Dewey Decimal Classification. Patterned after BISAC (Book Industry Standards and Communications) and the word-based system used by Maricopa County Library District, WordThink organizes materials according to 45 different categories with additional subcategories. Materials are then arranged alphabetically by title.
The call numbers in the WordThink system use words instead of numbers. The spine labels include up to four levels with eight characters per line, beginning with the top-level category. 
The Bennett and Perl Mack branch libraries were the first in the district to use WordThink. By the end of 2009, all Anythink libraries used the new word-based system.
Recognition.
Rangeview Library District and its Anythink libraries were the recipients of a 2010 National Medal for Museum and Library Service. The annual award, made by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) since 1994, recognizes institutions for outstanding social, educational, environmental, or economic contributions to their communities. U.S. Representative Jared Polis (CO-2) nominated the district for the award.
Pam Sandlian Smith was named 2010 Colorado Librarian of the Year by the Colorado Association of Libraries for her work at Rangeview Library District.
Anythink was named one of five recipients of the 2011 John Cotton Dana Award for its 2009-2010 brand launch. The award is presented by the American Library Association for outstanding public relations in libraries.
Funding.
Rangeview Library District’s current and future growth is due to the support of the Adams County community, who in November 2006 voted to approve a mill levy to help fund the library. Since then, through the leadership of library director Pam Sandlian Smith, the library system has shifted course and positioned itself so Anythink libraries are not only valuable resources but community gathering places.
Outreach Services.
In November 2008, Rangeview Library District unveiled its new bookmobile, which incorporates energy-efficient designs to reduce environmental impacts and noise. Since the launch of the brand, the bookmobile is now called Anythink in Motion. The lights and electric outlets are battery-powered by an inverter, which is charged while Anythink in Motion is driven and when plugged in at night. A Webasto heating system uses copper pipes under the floor that carry hot water, heating the bookmobile from the floor up. Sky lights provide natural light in the vessel, and Anythink in Motion gets twice as many miles per gallon as the old one. The Cummins Onan Quiet Diesel generator is used to cool the vehicle in the summertime, and its unique design reduces noise pollution and fumes.
Anythink in Motion currently visits area neighborhoods and community gathering places. It also visits several Adams County schools who have limited access to Anythink libraries.
Rangeview Library Friends Foundation.
The Rangeview Library Friends Foundation was created in 2009 to raise financial support for RLD from the private sector. The Foundation is a non-profit corporation organized solely for community and educational purposes within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
The Foundation’s mission and purposes are:
1. To generate broad-based public support and participation in order to forward and support RLD’s mission to "open doors for curious minds" by enhancing the public’s understanding and enjoyment of the Library through the use of special programs, activities and projects.
2. To work with RLD to raise money through contributions so that capital projects, programs and activities may continue to be provided for the general public.
The Foundation works with the RLD Board of Trustees and library director to identify needs for funding of special programs, activities and capital projects that cannot be funded with public-sector dollars.

Wymah Ferry

The Wymah Ferry is a cable ferry across the upper reach of Lake Hume, on the Murray River and on the border between the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria. The ferry crosses from the community of Wymah on the New South Wales side of the river, to Granya, and is approximately east of Albury.
The ferry is controlled by the New South Wales Roads and Maritime Services, but is jointly funded by both states. It operates seven days a week, and is free of tolls. From September to April, the ferry operates on demand from 0600 to 2100, and from 0700 to 2000 for the rest of the year, with several breaks during the day. If the ferry is not in operation, the alternatives are an detour downstream via the Bethanga Bridge and Albury, or a detour upstream via Jingellic.
The ferry route probably dates back to the 19th century. When the Hume Dam was completed in 1936, the range of the ferry had to be increased in order to cross the raised and widened water level of Lake Hume.
The current ferry boat is constructed principally of wood, and was built in 1946. The hull is long and wide, with long landing ramps at each end. The engine house is cantilevered approximately out to the side. Because of the variation in the water level in Lake Hume, the ferry operates between floating landing stages which are attached to each bank. The position of the landing stages is adjusted by hand winch to suit the level of the water.
The Wymah Ferry is one of only two cable ferries to cross the section of the Murray River between New South Wales and Victoria, the other being the Speewa Ferry nearly downstream. However there are another 11 such ferries further downstream, on the South Australia section of the river.

Sent (novel)

Sent is the second novel in The Missing series by Margaret Peterson Haddix. It was released on August 25, 2009.
Plot summary.
The children Jonah, Katherine, Chip, and another boy, Alex, have no preparation before they are sent back to the 15th century at the Tower of London by way of time travel.
JB doesn't want Jonah and Katherine in the fifteenth century but gives them one chance. They can stay and try to help fix time, but if they mess up JB will make them come back.
Katherine gets time sickness from the dramatic time warp. Jonah and Chip help her to her feet while they are talking to JB through a futuristic machine called the Elucidator. They quickly discover that Chip and Alex’s true identities are the 12-year-old King Edward V and his 10-year-old brother, Richard, the Duke of York. Chip tells Katherine she can be his queen and Jonah becomes annoyed, replying that "she's my sister."
In the Tower they find two ghostlike boys. JB explains that they are tracers, which show how time would have gone on if time travelers had not messed with them. Chip blends in with his tracer, and realizes he can think like King Edward V. He realizes that they are the princes and kings of London, that Richard III wants them dead, and that their mother has a plan for their escape. Soon, two men come to the room the tracers are in and throw the boys out the window. However, Jonah and Katherine pull Chip and Alex from their tracers. The group thinks that they succeeded in fixing time.
However, the men search for their bodies and the group is forced to hide. Chip gets frustrated at JB and throws the Elucidator at the wall. Jonah picks it up and finds that the Elucidator is critically damaged. They reset it, and use one of its functions to become invisible. The next morning, the group leaves the Tower and joins the coronation of Richard III. Chip and Alex run off, angry after seeing their uncle take the throne. Jonah and Katherine go to a chapel where Richard III is praying, and they pretend to be angels. They tell him that the princes are in heaven, but that he will never be able to go there himself. However, the Elucidator finishes resetting and Jonah and Katherine become visible again. They run away and eventually find Chip and Alex, who are with their mother and their sisters. JB explains, through the Elucidator, that one of the two men who threw the boys out of the window was sent by the queen to protect them.
He brings them out of time to tell them how and when to save Chip and Alex, and then drops them two years later in time. Katherine and Jonah meet Richard III again during the night, and tell him that if he gives the throne to Edward V/Chip, he will be forgiven and will go to Heaven. In the Battle of Bosworth Field, pitting Richard III against Henry VII of England. Jonah and Katherine try to get Alex and Chip out of their tracers so they can tell them they need to leave. When Jonah can't, Katherine gets Chip out by telling him she would be his girlfriend if he asked. Chip gets Alex out but then Richard III comes to Edward V/Chip and tells him that he will give Edward V back the throne after the battle. The battle ensues, and Richard III is killed. Jonah and Katherine pull Chip and Alex out just before they get killed in original history. JB makes them come back to the cave using the Elucidator. JB explains to the group that they succeeded - they did save Chip and Alex, yet managed to keep history the same because Richard III was dead, the princes were considered dead, and all the people who knew that Richard III planned to give back the throne were dead in the battle.
When they are back in the present, JB asks Jonah and Katherine to "help" another kid. JB gives them another "traveling companion," a girl named Andrea, who is really Virginia Dare from the lost colony of Roanoke. JB tells Chip and Alex they have to stay in the present while Jonah and Katherine are gone. JB replies that it will seem they were gone for a few minutes, but Chip says he knows it will be longer. Chip and Alex are just about to resent but then Jonah and Katherine are sent back into time.
Main Characters.
Jonah - 13, seventh grade boy, adopted, Katherine's brother by adoption
Chip - 13, seventh grade boy, adopted, Jonah's friend
Katherine - 12, sixth grade girl, Jonah's sister by adoption

Nigah

Nigah is a Pakistani drama serial, released in mid-2002, which attempts to delve into certain, South Asian socio-cultural mindsets. It fared lukewarm with audiences, and has been criticized for its lack of logic.
Plot.
The drama basically revolves around Nigah (Aaminah Haq) and Jawad (Noman Aijaz) who, falling in love soon after their first meeting, plan to get married. The discovery that their fathers (Masood Akhtar and Firdaus Jamal) are old friends only eases things for the couple. 
But are problems on their way! 
As a wedding gift, Jawad receives a painting of a bride and a groom. To his shock, the bride in the picture is Nigah! His immediate reaction is doubt, which soon converts into hatred as Jawad begins to think that Nigah is unfaithful. Nigah tries to convince him of her innocence, but he refuses to listen. Things continue to worsen and, ultimately throwing Nigah out of the house, Jawad attempts to start a relationship with his cousin, Shama (Irum Hasan), whom he had earlier rejected. Needless to say, the attempt fails as, deep inside, he still feels for Nigah. 
The groom in the picture, on the other hand, is Daniyal, a wealthy and prosperous businessman. Fate is unkind to him, too, and his picture with Nigah is published in newspapers by enemies as soon as he gets engaged to a girl, Aashi. His character, like Nigah's, comes under the shadow of doubt, and he is shattered mentally and emotionally. 
Through a twist, Daniyal and Nigah meet each other, and set out to solve the mystery of the portrait.
Reception.
In 2008, "Nigah" was repeat-telecasted on PTV Home. The drama was aired from Monday to Friday, for thirty minutes each day, during the Matinee Time show, which re-telecasts quality television serials to provide home, family entertainment.

In 1934 the range included 250 cc and 500 cc motorcycles with JAP engines and 175 cc models with a choice of a JAP engine or one made by Fusi themselves. After 1936 Fusi stopped using the RAS brand name and sold its machines as Fusi.
In 1937 Fusi launched a 500 cc powered tricycle as a light goods vehicle. In the same year Fusi bought Catelli i Fiorani in Pesaro, who made CF motorcycles, and rebranded that company's range as Fusi. In 1941 Fusi introduced the M 25 CFS, which had a 248 cc four-stroke engine. This model formed a basis for many further products, including sport bikes, updated and produced until in the 1950s.

William Bolts

William Bolts (1739–1808) began his career as an employee of the English East India Company but subsequently became an independent merchant. Throughout his life, Bolts continued to propose and execute various trading ventures on his own behalf and in conjunction with various commercial and governmental partners. The ventures of individual traders like Bolts did much to spur governments and large corporations into the expansion of their own interests and empires. He is also known for his book, "Considerations on India Affairs" (1772), which detailed the exploitation and despoliation of Bengal by the East India Company (EIC) and its officials which began shortly after the Battle of Plassey in 1757.
Biography.
William Bolts was born in Amsterdam on 7 February 1739. The baptismal register of the English Church in Amsterdam records his baptism on 21 February 1739, his parents being William and Sarah Bolts (his mother was perhaps English, his father German, from the Palatinate).
East India Company service.
He spent some time working in Lisbon in the diamond trade, according to a deposition he made in 1801, before he went out to Bengal in 1759 where he was employed in Calcutta as a factor in the service of the English East India Company. He learned to speak Bengali, an addition to his other languages, English, Dutch, German, Portuguese and French. Later he was appointed to the Company’s Benares (Varanasi) factory, where he opened a woollens mart, developed saltpetre manufacturing, established opium works, imported cotton, and promoted the trade in diamonds from the Panna and Chudderpoor (Chhatarpur) mines in Bundelkhand.
He fell foul of the East India Company in 1768, possibly because diamonds were a favourite means for Company employees to secretly remit to Britain the ill-gotten gains of private trade in India which they were officially forbidden to engage in. He announced in September of that year that he intended to start up a newspaper in Calcutta (which would have been India’s first modern newspaper), saying that he had “in manuscript many things to communicate which most intimately concerned every individual”, but he was directed to quit Bengal and proceed to Madras and from thence to take his passage to England. Company officials declared him bankrupt, “to the irretrievable loss of his Fortune”, he later claimed. He never seems to have been able to redeem himself in the eyes of the Company, and in London and elsewhere fought a rearguard action against his many opponents within it. In 1772 he published "Considerations on India Affairs," in which he attacked the whole system of the English government in Bengal, and particularly complained of the arbitrary power exercised by the authorities and of his own deportation. The book was translated into French and enjoyed wide circulation, which contributed to his fame on the Continent.
Author.
As an employee of the East India Company, Bolts had seen how Bengal, once a prosperous region, was despoiled and bled white by the East India Company. His observations and experiences were recorded in his book, "Considerations on India Affairs", 1772. Bolts' work is a unique source for scholars inquiring into the nature of early British rule in Bengal.
The voyage of the "Giuseppe e Teresa," 1776-1781.
In 1775, Bolts offered his services to the Imperial government, putting forward a proposal for re-establishing Austrian trade with India from the Adriatic port of Trieste. His proposal was accepted by the government of Empress Maria Theresa, and on 24 September 1776, Bolts sailed from Leghorn in the dominions of Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany, the younger son of the Empress, to India in command of a ship under the Imperial flag, the former Indiaman "Earl of Lincoln," renamed the "Giuseppe e Teresa" (also called "Joseph et Thérèse" or "Joseph und Theresia"). He took with him a ten-year charter authorising him to trade under Imperial colours between Austria’s Adriatic ports and Persia, India, China and Africa, and from Africa and Madagascar to America. This enterprise required substantial capital, which Bolts sought in the Austrian Netherlands (Belgium), and he brought in the Antwerp banker, Charles Proli, and his associates, the bankers I.C.I. Borrikens and D. Nagel.
Colonisation of Delagoa Bay.
In the next few years Bolts established factories on the Malabar Coast, on the South East African coast at Delagoa Bay and at the Nicobar Islands. His aim in establishing a factory at Delagoa Bay was to use it as a base for trade between East Africa and the West coast ports of India. He procured three ships to conduct this “country” trade, as trade by Europeans between India and other non-European destinations was called. During his voyage out he obtained Brazilian cochineal beetles at Rio de Janeiro and transported them to Delagoa Bay, thereby predating the introduction to Bengal of this insect for the making of scarlet dyes and carmine. The Imperial flag did not fly for long over Delagoa Bay, as alarmed Portuguese authorities who claimed the place as their own sent a 40-gun frigate and 500 men from Goa to remove Bolts’s men in April 1781, and to found the presidio of Lourenço Marques (Maputo)that established a permanent Portuguese presence there.
Activities in India, 1776-1781.
When it learned of Bolts’s venture, the English East India Company instructed its officers in Bengal, Madras and Bombay to “pursue the most effectual means that can be fully justified to counteract and defeat” him. Bolts took full advantage of Austria’s neutral status in the war between Britain and France, Spain and Holland during 1778 to 1783 that formed part of the struggle for American independence. The Company’s repeated acts of hostility against Bolts in India were the subject of urgent representations by the Austrian Ambassador in London, resulting in the sending in January 1782 of instructions from the Court of Directors to India, which ordered their officers in India not to give offence to "any subject of his Imperial Majesty".
Although when he first arrived in India, at Surat, he was confronted with a wall of opposition erected by the East India Company, he soon made himself known to Hyder Ali, Nawab of Mysore and the strongest opponent of the English in India. He visited the Nawab at his capital, Seringapatam, where he was granted permission to establish trading factories in the Nawab’s Malabar Coast dominions at Mangalore, Karwar and Baliapatam.
Colonisation of the Nicobar Islands.
While Bolts himself was at Seringapatam, he sent the "Joseph und Theresia" to the Nicobar Islands, where she arrived in June 1778. There her captain, Bennet, took possession on 12 July. The islands were the focus of a Christian missionary effort of the Moravian Brethren, who visited from time to time from the Danish base on the Indian mainland at Tranquebar. In consequence of Bolts’s action, the Imperial company had established a trading factory on the island of Nancowery, headed by Gottfried Stahl who was accompanied by five other Europeans. Danish authorities strongly protested against Bolts’s action in taking possession of the Nicobars, and in 1783 sent a warship to remove the Austrians.
Bolts in dispute with Proli.
In spite of his many achievements since 1776, Bolts’s venture on the whole had made a loss, to the dismay of his Belgian financial backers, Charles Proli and his associates. Proli also disagreed with Bolts over the importance of the China market: Proli wanted to concentrate exclusively on that market while Bolts urged the equal importance of India as Austrian commodities, such as mercury, lead, copper, iron, tin and vitriol, could find sale there, in contrast to China where only Spanish silver dollars were accepted in return for Chinese products such as tea, porcelain and silk. While Bolts was still in India, the Proli group sent out two ships, the "Ville de Vienne" to Mauritius and the "Prince Kaunitz" to China, without informing him. In ignorance of Bolts’s purchase of a ship he called the "Prince Kaunitz," the Proli group sent another ship of the same name to China independently of him. This constituted a breach of their contract with him. They refused to honour the bills he drew upon their bank while he was in India. They petitioned the Imperial Government to have his charter transferred exclusively to them. They also seized the "Joseph et Therese" as security when the vessel returned to Leghorn. At an audience with Emperor Joseph II in Brussels on 28 July 1781, Bolt and Proli agreed to the transformation of their association into a share company, and in August Bolts surrendered his charters to the new Imperial Company of Trieste and Antwerp for the Commerce of Asia (Société Impériale pour le Commerce Asiatique de Trieste et d’Anvers). The Company was to send six ships to China and India, two to East Africa and Mauritius, and three for the southern whale fishery.
Imperial Company of Trieste and Antwerp.
The Imperial Company of Trieste and Antwerp was opened to public subscription in August 1781 to raise, nominally, half its capital in one thousand shares. In fact, the Company was seriously under-capitalized, as the other thousand shares held by the Proli group and Bolts were paid for by the nominal value of the assets of the former association. Bolts’s valuation of those assets was accepted at face value, but it was a fictitious valuation and in fact the new Company inherited the old association’s debts. It consequently suffered chronic lack of cash and had to resort to short term loans and bottomry bonds (for which the ships themselves were the collateral) at a premium of 30 to 35 per cent. Under these conditions, every voyage had to be a success for the Company to remain viable. Also under the terms of the agreement erecting the new company, Bolts ceded his charter to his Belgian partners in return for a loan of 200,000 florins (that is, his 200 shares in the Company) and the right to send two ships on his own account to China.
The Imperial Asiatic Company under the direction of the Proli group focussed on the China tea trade. In 1781, 1782 and 1783 the price of tea in Europe, especially in England, had risen to unheard of levels. In 1781 and 1782 no Dutch or French ships appeared at Canton as a result of the American War, and in 1782 only eleven English, three Danish and two Swedish ships called there. Only four out of thirteen English ships returned safely in 1783 due to French naval activity. Attempting to seize the opportunity to make good profits, the Proli group sent five ships to Canton: the "Croate," the "Kollowrath," the "Zinzendorff," the "Archiduc Maximilien," and the "Autrichien." However, the opportunity had been missed as, with the signing of an armistice in January 1783 the former belligerents were able to send their ships to Canton safely, and the summer of 1783 saw a total of thirty-eight ships there, including the five Imperial vessels. They had to buy tea at a high price, but when they returned to Ostend in July 1784 they had to sell at a low price on a glutted market, as well as having to pay for permission to return to that port. The price of tea at Ostend collapsed when the British Government introduced the "Commutation Act" in 1784, which reduced the tax on tea from fifty to ten per cent and made smuggling from the Netherlands unprofitable. The price of tea in Europe fell suddenly from 30 to 33 French sols to 11 to 14 sols, or around sixty per cent. Disastrously, a sixth ship, the Belgioioso, carrying a large amount of silver specie for the purchase of Chinese goods, foundered in a storm in the Irish Sea soon after departing Liverpool, where she was fitted out, on the voyage to Canton. Regardless of mounting losses, debts and liabilities, the Company invested in a further ship, the "Kaiserliche Adler" or "Aigle Impériale" ["Imperial Eagle"], a giant of 1,100 tons, specially built for the Company by the Fiume shipyards, which was launched in March 1784, bringing the Company’s fleet to a total of nine vessels. Matters came to a head in January 1785 when the Company suspended all payments, and shortly afterwards it was declared bankrupt, bringing the Proli banking house down with it. Charles Proli committed suicide. An article in the Dublin press of 25 May 1786 recorded the sale of the dissolved company’s ships, "Zinderdorf" , "Kollowrath, Kaunitz, Maximilian" and "Austrian," "together with their whole apparel, guns, stores, &c." and observed: “The destruction of this company, as well as several others in Europe, is in a great measure owing to the commutation tea tax in England, and the advantages which territorial possessions throw in favour of the British company.”
Bolts's Plan for a voyage to the North West Coast of America.
After Bolts returned from India in May 1781, he developed the idea for a voyage to the North West Coast of America to engage in the trade in sea otter furs to China and Japan. He apparently heard from John Reid, his agent at Canton (Guang Zhou), of the success the crew of James Cook’s ships had had there in November 1779 in selling the sea otter pelts they had obtained for trinkets on the American coast in the course of Cook’s third expedition to the Pacific. Bolts's ship, the "Kaunitz" (not to be confused with the Proli group's vessel of the same name), arrived back at Leghorn (Livorno) from Canton with this news on 8 July 1781. Bolts afterwards wrote that he had the ambition of wishing to be the first to profit from this new branch of trade. At an audience in Vienna in May 1782, Bolts discussed his plan with Emperor Joseph II, for which he had bought a ship in England in November 1781. The ship was called the "Cobenzell" (or "Cobenzl") in honour of the Vice-Chancellor of State, Count Philipp Cobenzl (Kobenzl), a patron of the Imperial Company. Bolts’s plan called for the ship to round Cape Horn, take on furs at Nootka, sell or trade them in China and Japan, and return by the Cape of Good Hope. He engaged four sailors who had served under Cook, including George Dixon, who subsequently commanded the "Queen Charlotte" on a voyage to the North West coast for the Etches Company of London, and Heinrich Zimmermann, who had written an account in German of Cook's final voyage. He bought a sloop, the "Trieste," as a tender, and obtained letters of credence from the Emperor to various rulers at whose ports the ship would touch.
Proposed scientific voyage of discovery.
The Emperor lent a ready ear to Bolts as the venture offered a vehicle for carrying into effect his desire, prompted by the voyages of James Cook, for an Austrian round the world voyage dedicated to scientific research. This had been urged by the eminent savant Ignaz von Born who, at the Emperor’s invitation, nominated five naturalists to go with Bolts on the "Cobenzell". The intended expedition was reported in the English press in mid-October 1782, in the following terms:
The Emperor intends to signalise himself, in imitation of other Princes, by sending a ship round the world to make discoveries. The vessel destined for this tedious and dangerous expedition, is the Count de Cobenzet , which cleared out of the Port of London the 15th of April last; sailed from Leghorn the 26th of August, and arrived at Trieste the 1st of September with a great cargo, part of which she is to take out with her, particularly fourteen chests of watches and watch-work, which she brought from London. Four persons of great learning are to be sent out in her, at the Emperor’s expence, to make discoveries in Natural Philosophy. 
Although the Emperor was initially enthusiastic, he refused to provide finance for it apart from the expenses of his naturalists, and the venture eventually proved impossible to realise. Bolts’s hopes for a commercial voyage and the desire of the Emperor and his naturalists for a voyage of scientific discovery were incompatible as a combined undertaking. The opposition of Bolts’s Belgian former financial partners and now rivals in the Imperial Asiatic Company of Trieste and Antwerp was also a cause of its not going ahead, and in the autumn of 1782 it was abandoned. Instead of sending out a scientific expedition on an Austrian ship as Born had proposed, the Austrian naturalists under the leadership of Franz Jozef Maerter went from Le Havre in April 1783 on the American frigate "General Washington" (Captain Joshua Barney) to Philadelphia and thence to South Carolina, Florida, the Bahamas and Santo Domingo (Hispaniola). Besides plants, they were to collect animal and mineral specimens. Reflecting the origins of the enterprise, their instructions gave them the option (which was not taken up) to take ship from Acapulco in Mexico to the Philippines, thence to the Sunda Islands in the Dutch East Indies, the coasts of Bengal, Coromandel and Malabar, and the Iles de France and Bourbon (Mauritius and Reunion).
Bolts’s approaches to Russia and Naples.
Bolts refused to give up on his hopes for a voyage to the North West coast of America. Emperor Joseph II released Bolts from his obligations (except to his creditors) and gave him leave in November 1782 to take his proposal to the court of Catherine II of Russia. The Russian Court proved unresponsive, so Bolts also put his proposal before the court of Joseph’s brother-in-law, Ferdinand IV, King of Naples He had an encouraging response from Naples, where King Ferdinand’s Minister of Commerce and the Navy, General Sir John Acton, wanted to promote the kingdom’s maritime trade. King Ferdinand gave Bolts a charter, modelled on that he had received from the Empress Maria Theresa in 1776, with a term of twenty-one years from 1786, for a Royal Indian Company of Naples (Regia Società del India di Napoli), but the Neapolitan government agreed to support Bolts only after he had made a successful initial voyage at his own expense and risk. Preparations were begun in Marseilles to fit out the Ferdinand, a ship Bolts planned to send to the North West Coast under the Neapolitan flag, but the venture was abandoned when Bolts received a more positive response from the French government.
Bolts and the Lapérouse expedition.
With the Emperor’s permission, Bolts also put his proposal to Joseph’s other brother-in-law, Louis XVI of France. Bolts outlined his plan in letters he wrote to the Maréchal de Castries on 25 January and 9 April 1785. The "Cobenzell" would be sent round Cape Horn to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), Nootka Sound, the Kurile Islands and China. The sloop would be left at Nootka to trade for furs, while a couple of Frenchmen would be left in the Kuriles to learn Japanese and adopt the dress and ways of the inhabitants. At least two ships would be employed to maintain communication with Europe via both the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn. A botanist, metallurgist and astronomer would be employed. In the South Atlantic, Tristan da Cunha was to be claimed for France and settled as a base for the whaling industry. In addition to Tristan, "the Island discovered by La Roche in 1675" (probably South Georgia) was to be found and settled. The French government adopted the concept, though not its author, leading to the sending out of an expedition under the command of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse. Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu, Directeur des Ports et Arsenaux, stated in the draft of the memorandum on the expedition he submitted to the King: “the utility which may result from a voyage of discovery….has made me receptive to the views put to me by Mr. Bolts relative to this enterprise”. However, as Fleurieu explained to the King: “I am not proposing at all, however, the plan for this voyage as it was conceived by Mr. Bolts”. Political and strategic considerations took priority over the commercial. Bolts was paid 1,200 louis for “the communications useful for the Service which he has given”, but was given no part in the preparation or execution of the Lapérouse expedition.
The voyages of the "Cobenzell" to India and the "Belgiojoso" to China.
At odds with his suspicious Antwerp backers, Bolts found himself declared bankrupt in mid-1782. Although he possessed no capital himself, he was able to trade on his reputation as an expert in the Eastern trade to launch a new share company in 1783, the Triestine Society, which in September sent the "Cobenzell" on a commercial voyage to the Malabar Coast by way of Marseilles, where she took in the principal part of her cargo, and the Cape of Good Hope. At Bombay, a second ship was purchased, called the "Count de Belgiojoso." The captain of the Cobenzell, John Joseph Bauer, transferred to the "Belgiojoso", and sailed on to China. It was reported from Trieste on 22 February 1786 that "The Comte Cobenzel East Indiaman arrived in this port the 18th inst. with a rich cargo" of saltpetre, tea, cassia, camphire, coffee, pepper and other merchandise, having left Canton 23 January 1785. The "Belgioioso" under Bauer went from Canton to New York, where she arrived in June 1786. The ship's arrival from New York at Dover, England, was reported in "The Daily Universal Register" of 15 September, and the same newspaper published an extract of a letter from Ostend dated 24 September that said: “The Count de Belgioioso, on account of the East India Company, is arrived here from Bengal and China, her cargo consists chiefly of piece goods, with only a few chests of the finest teas, and one of spices, from Ceylon, at which island they touched on their way home”.
The voyage of the "Imperial Eagle".
Having missed the opportunity provided by the American War of Independence to send a ship to the North West Coast undisturbed by British, American or French competitors, Bolts was apparently able to share in the only voyage sent there under the Imperial flag, that of the "Imperial Eagle," the former English East Indiaman "Loudoun," which in November 1786 sailed from Ostend under Charles William Barkley. Having cleared Ostend in November 1786, the "Imperial Eagle" touched at Hawaii in May 1787 and reached Nootka in June, from whence she traded southward for two months along the American coast. Barkley added significantly to knowledge of the geography of the area during this voyage, notably identifying the Strait of Juan de Fuca. He returned to Macao with his takings of furs on 5 November. The expedition was apparently profitable, as an article in "The London Chronicle" of 21 June 1788 reported that, "After taking in his cargo, &c. &c. Captain Berkeley proceeded to Macao, where he disposed of his furs at an amazing price". It was originally intended that the "Imperial Eagle" would make three voyages to the North West Coast, Japan and Kamchatka, but when she reached Canton after her first season she was sold under threat of retaliation from the East India Company for breaching its monopoly.
Plan to colonise Australia 1786-1787.
In November 1786, Bolts was given a contract by King Gustav III of Sweden to discover an island off the coast of Western Australia, where a Swedish colony and trading post could be established. However, the plan was shelved after Sweden became embroiled in war with Russia the following year. Bolts was given 250 pounds for his trouble, and the proposed colony was never established.
Bolts's final years.
Bolts is said to have attempted to revive his fortunes in France, setting up an enterprise near Paris, but the outbreak of war with Austria and Britain once again destroyed his hopes.He returned to England in 1800-01, where he attempted unsuccessfully to interest the East India Company in obtaining supplies of copper from Anatolia to sell in India. He then moved to Lisbon where in the 1760s, before joining the English East India Company, he had worked in the diamond trade. He made his last will in Lisbon in August 1805 and died, it is said, in a Paris poorhouse (hôpital) in 1808.

2009 British Grand Prix

The 2009 British Grand Prix (formally the 2009 Formula 1 Santander British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held at the Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire, England on 21 June 2009. The race, contested over 60 laps, was the eighth round of the 2009 Formula One season. It was scheduled to be the last British Grand Prix to be held at Silverstone, before the event moved to Donington Park for the 2010 season. However, due to Donington being unable to raise the required funds the event returned to Silverstone again in 2010. The race was won by Sebastian Vettel, who started on pole, with championship leader Jenson Button finishing in sixth position.
Report.
Background.
Home driver Jenson Button led the Drivers' Championship by 26 points from Brawn teammate Rubens Barrichello. Barrichello was 8 points clear of Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, who lay 1.5 points ahead of his teammate, Mark Webber.
Brawn GP led the Constructors' Championship by 39.5 points from Red Bull Racing and were a further 24 points ahead of Japanese manufacturer Toyota.
Home favourite and reigning World Champion, Lewis Hamilton, had won the previous year's event for McLaren. As well as Hamilton, the British Grand Prix has a history of native success. Down the years these include wins for David Coulthard, Johnny Herbert, Damon Hill, Nigel Mansell, John Watson, James Hunt, Jackie Stewart, Jim Clark and Stirling Moss. Britain was to be represented this year by Hamilton and Jenson Button.
Due to the continuing political dispute between the Formula 1 Teams Association (FOTA), the FIA and Formula 1 Management (FOM), there was talk that the teams against the proposed 2010 season budget cap would not compete in the 2010 season.
Other former British GP winners in the field were Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen, Renault's Fernando Alonso and Brawn GP driver Rubens Barrichello.
Practice and qualifying.
Sebastian Vettel was fastest in both the first and second practice sessions, with Mark Webber coming second in both. The final session saw Nico Rosberg top the time charts.
Qualifying began in some of the coolest conditions experienced all year, with an air temperature of just . The session was mostly dominated by the Red Bull drivers, until a late flying lap by Kazuki Nakajima saw him fastest by a tenth of a second. The session ended prematurely in the final minute when Adrian Sutil crashed heavily at Abbey, forcing reigning World Champion Lewis Hamilton to abort his final lap and leaving him nineteenth with Giancarlo Fisichella, Sébastien Bourdais, Sutil and Sébastien Buemi also eliminated. Sutil's accident was later found to have been a result of brake failure.
The second session did not begin until the remains of Sutil's car were removed from the circuit, with track conditions remaining constant and Red Bull continuing their pace, with Mark Webber remaining unchallenged for most of the session with teammate Sebastian Vettel only out-pacing him on his final run. Championship leader Jenson Button only narrowly missed elimination, setting the eight-fastest time at the end of the session when he had previously been sitting eleventh. Felipe Massa, Robert Kubica, Heikki Kovalainen, Nelson Piquet, Jr. and Nick Heidfeld were all eliminated.
The third and final session saw most of the cars switching to the softer option tyre. Sebastian Vettel took pole from Rubens Barrichello, with Webber third. Button qualified sixth – his worst of the season – after Nakajima found some of his first-session pace to steal fifth place out from under him, resulting in his career-best qualifying position. When the weights of each car was published post-qualifying, it emerged that Vettel was 9 kg heavier than the Brawn of Barrichello and 7 kg heavier than teammate Webber. After qualifying, it was announced that BMW Sauber would be abandoning their KERS program for good.
Race.
Vettel and Red Bull dominated the Grand Prix, with the young German driving away from the field from pole position, often pulling away from Barrichello at the rate of one second per lap. 
It was a good day for the Red Bull drivers from the moment the lights went out, with championship rival Button dropping down to ninth position at the end of the first lap after a poor start. Fellow home driver Hamilton was having more success, albeit from 19th on the grid, gaining four positions in the first two laps. The mixed-up race order was perhaps reflective of the season as a whole, with the only World Champions in the field – Raikkonen, Alonso and Hamilton – at one point battling for 13th, 14th and 15th positions. 
At the front of the race while Vettel was setting fastest laps, teammate Mark Webber was unable to pass Rubens Barrichello for second position until the Brazilian pitted on lap 20. Webber pitted a lap later but produced a good enough in-lap to emerge from the pits ahead of Barrichello. Nico Rosberg also benefited from the pit stop phase, emerging in fourth position, ahead of Felipe Massa. 
Hamilton's eventful race at the back of the field continued, running off track on several occasions. He was able to pass teammate Heikki Kovalainen who had just emerged from the pits on lap 34. The following lap, Sebastian Bourdais attempted a similar manoeuvre at the Abbey chicane, however the Toro Rosso driver was less successful, colliding with the Finn and causing both cars to retire.
At the second round of pit-stops, Button was able to take advantage of a long middle stint to move ahead of Raikkonen and Trulli and up to sixth position, behind Massa, who had in-turn leap-frogged Rosberg for fourth. Button was on the faster tyre compound and pressured both cars until the finish, but was unable to pass Rosberg despite being just 0.3 seconds behind the German at the start of the last lap. Rosberg was himself just 0.8 seconds behind Massa.
As Vettel took the chequered flag, he was 15.1 seconds ahead of teammate Webber, who was a further 25.9 seconds ahead of Barrichello. Jarno Trulli finished in 7th ahead of Raikkonen, who had to endure late pressure from Trulli's teammate Timo Glock. Hamilton finished a lowly 16th.
Post-race.
The combination of the fast sweeping circuit suiting the updated Red Bull RB5 and cold conditions hampering the Brawn produced what was a disappointing result for pace-setting Brawn. Button's championship lead was reduced to a still substantial championship lead of 23 points over Barrichello, who was now just 2 points ahead of Vettel. Webber was a further 3.5 points behind, while Brawn's constructors championship lead was also cut.
Red Bull's Christian Horner declared his team could mount a serious title challenge following the successful showing of their updated car, claiming it should be quick on the remaining circuits. Vettel declared his car to be "fantastic" while Mark Webber praised the team but admitted a mistake in qualifying cost him any chance of winning. The race also saw Vettel claim his first "hat trick", with pole, fastest lap and the win. Button dismissed talk of Red Bull now having a sizeable advantage, saying Brawn looked wearer than they were because of the cool conditions.
There were contrasting emotions for 2008 title contenders Felipe Massa and Lewis Hamilton, Massa describing his race from 11th to 4th as good as winning the race while Hamilton said he was pushing his hardest despite finishing 16th.
Away from the track action, the talk of the paddock was the threat of a breakaway series, with FIA President Max Mosley confident of a solution to the dispute. Commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone admitted for the first time the British Grand Prix would be returning to Silverstone if Donington Park was unable to host the 2010 event.

Father Dueñas Memorial School

Father Dueñas Memorial School (FDMS) is an all-male Catholic high school located in Mangilao, in the United States territory of Guam.
It is within the territory of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Agaña. The school is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.
Most Rev. Appolinaris W. Baumgartner, OFM Cap. founded the school in 1948. It was named after Father Jesus Baza Dueñas, a Chamorro priest who was beheaded by Japanese forces during World War II. The school began as a seminary to teach young men to become priests; it became a university preparatory school.
History.
On October 1, 1948, Bishop Apolinaris Baumgartner, OFM Cap. established Father Dueñas Memorial School (FDMS) as a minor seminary and a high school for young men, near the site of Fr. Duenas’ martyrdom. The Stigmatine Fathers were the first administrators of FDMS and the school graduated its first batch of 11 young men in 1950. The first buildings were simple Quonset huts that were gradually replaced by concrete structures with the help of the FD families and community volunteers.
Subsequently, FDMS was administered by the Capuchin Franciscan Friars (1959-1974), the Marist Brothers (1974-1989), the Canons Regular (1989-1991), Mr. Jack Stettenbenz (1991), Mr. William Roth (1991-2009), the Salesians of Don Bosco (2009-2012) and currently, Fr. Jeffrey C. San Nicolas as principal and Mr. Tony Thompson as vice-principal.
Student Life.
Academics.
As a college preparatory school, students are required to take four years of English, mathematics, science, social studies, and theology.
Students at Father Dueñas Memorial School compete in numerous academic competitions each year. Academic competitions include the American Mathematics Competition, Academic Challenge Bowl, Mock Trial, and the National Forensic League.
Athletics.
Father Dueñas Memorial School is the only private school on island to offer all of the Independent Interscholastic Athletic Association of Guam (IIAAG) sports for boys. These sports include football, golf, basketball, paddling, cross country, soccer, rugby, volleyball, track and field, wrestling, baseball, and tennis.
Arts.
To ensure student success, Father Dueñas Memorial School encourages student participation in areas outside of academics and athletics. Every year since 1981, the schools hosts its annual songfest competition. Starting out as a simple song competition among each class currently in attendance, it has evolved over the years to include multiple performances by each class, with choreography and visual effects.
In addition to songfest, the students participate in an annual Christmas concert and are afforded the opportunity to audition and participate in the school production.
Navy Junior Reserve Officer's Training Corp.
The Father Dueñas Memorial School Navy Junior Reserve Officer's Training Corp Phoenix Company was started by Commander Charles E. White in 1973, as the one of the first JROTC programs on the island and the only NJROTC program at the time. Though initially difficult due to the school's small size and island's relative distance from the mainland United States, the program eventually flourished into what it is today. It is currently the only JROTC program offered at a private school on the island. With approximately 20-25% of the school's population enrolled in the program at any given time, the program has the highest percentage of students in the JROTC program out of Guam's schools that have JROTC program established. The program is known for sending graduates to the United States Service academies or the Reserve Officers' Training Corps program each year. Notable graduates of the program include Governor Felix Camacho ('76) and Rear Admiral Peter Gumataotao ('76).

Dan McMichael

Dan McMichael (circa 1860 — 6 February 1919) was an Irish manager, treasurer, secretary and physiotherapist of the Scottish football club Hibernian during the late 19th Century and early 20th Century. He is the only manager to have taken charge of Hibs in two separate spells, being the first manager of the club from 1900–03 and returning in 1904 after Phil Kelso left for Arsenal. He subsequently held this position for fifteen years, also making him the club's longest serving manager to date.
McMichael, who was a sprinter in his youth, helped revive the club after it was threatened with closure during the early 1890s. He became the club's manager in 1904 after the club became a limited liability company, which meant that the team was no longer run by committee. He was effectively the manager before then as well, and he led the team that won the Scottish Cup in 1902 and the Scottish league championship in 1903.
McMichael served as Hibs manager and in other capacities until 1919, when he was one of the casualties of the Spanish flu pandemic. Like many of the pandemic victims, McMichael was buried in an unmarked grave. Several decades later, a group of Hibs supporters found the grave site from local records and raised funds for a gravestone. A dedication ceremony was carried out in December 2013, attended by 400 people.

History.
When the church was finished, in 1871, it was the second Anglican church to be built in the Holy Land. The first is located in Jerusalem. The building was consecrated by Bp. Samuel Gobat, and the Rev. John Zeller was the pastor at the time of its consecration. The Church Mission Society (CMS) provided many of the early missionaries who served at Christ Church. It served as a mission center for the region and ministry also took place in Mujeidal (Migdal HaEmek, today), Reineh, and Cana of Galilee (Kafr Kana).
A number of influential pastors and missionaries ministered at Christ Church or were based there. These include Frederick Augustus Klein, Michael Ka'war, Seraphim Boutaji, and Khalil Jamal. The last of which was essential in founding the Protestant presence on the East Bank of the Jordan.

Bertha Gilkey

Bertha Knox Gilkey (born March 18, 1949, in Round Pound, Arkansas) is an African-American activist of tenant management of public housing properties. She set up the first tenant management association in St. Louis, Missouri, which successfully rehabilitated the once decrepit Cochran Gardens public housing project, and managed it for more than 20 years.
Biography.
According to her own statement, Gilkey was born in bitter poverty in Arkansas. Emma Green, her mother, relocated to St. Louis in 1960 and raised her fifteen children in a three-bedroom apartment at Cochran Gardens - the first high-rise project of Saint-Louis financed through the Housing Act of 1949, completed in 1953. Initially intended for low-income whites, the 704-unit block was desegregated in 1956. Emma Green and her children were among its first black tenants.
When Cochran was all white, they didn't refer to it as a project. It was called Cochran Gardens. As Cochran became more and more black, I began to see the services reduced. Once it became all black, there was no standards. It moved from being a neighborhood to a project. It became a dumping ground.<br>Bertha Gilkey, 1999 
In 1969 Gilkey, then a 20-year-old divorced mother of two who called herself a Black Panther led a nine-month rent strike of some twenty-two thousand public housing tenants against mismanagement of municipal agencies and the intolerable living conditions of St. Louis highrise ghettoes—Pruitt–Igoe, Cochran Gardens and the like. The city replaced its Housing Authority board, and after six more years of activism Bertha Gilkey succeeded in persuading the city of St. Louis to surrender management of Cochran Gardens, to an independent tenant management association. By this time, Pruitt–Igoe has already been torn down and Cochran Gardens, nicknamed "Little Nam", has already been slated for demolition. Her mother, ex-husband and siblings eventually left Cochran for better places, but Gilkey preferred to stay.
The Cochran Tenant Management Corporation became the first of its kind in St. Louis. In a short time the new management rehabilitated Cochran Gardens into a relatively safe and comfortable place. Since 1978 the complex was modernized and outfitted with new engineering systems, owing both to Gilkey's fundraising skills and to Cochran's nearly downtown location that could not be ignored by city and federal authorities. By 1992 Cochran received $33 million in federal aid, twice as much as the second-ranking St. Louis project. Gilkey personally managed the staff that reached 47 in 1991; only at this point did Gilkey hire a professional manager and accountant to run the operations. She was not ever paid a salary at Cochran (according to a 1992 source), making a living with consultancies and paid public speaking.
Her experience fell in accord with the Republican campaign for deregulation and changing the rules of welfare administration. Gilkey, among other activists, was invited to join Ronald Reagan as he signed the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987: 
"Joining me are three of our national heroes of the tenant management movement: Kimi Gray, of the Kenilworth-Parkside Resident Management Corporation here in Washington, DC; Bertha Gilkey, of the Cochran Tenant Management Corporation in St. Louis; and Mildred Hailey, the founder of the tenant management movement at the Bromley-Heath Tenant Management Corporation in Boston. And they remind us that ownership or control of one's own residence should be an opportunity for every citizen." -- Ronald Reagan, February 5, 1988.
Jack Kemp, Housing Secretary under George H. W. Bush, regularly cited Gilkey in an honor roll of civil rights heroes, alongside Abraham Lincoln, saying that tenant property management is "one of the most powerful manifestations of revolutionary ideals since 1776." President George H. W. Bush visited Cochran Gardens in May 1991, commending tenant management and personally Betha Gilkey and attacking "government bureaucracy" and the "solutions of the 1960's". Federal supporters of tenant management did not publicize the fact that most of Cochran residents remained poor and lived on welfare throughout the decades of Gilkey's tenure. In 1990 85% of households were headed by single women, only 27% of heads of households had jobs. Vacancy in 1990 was on par with St. Louis average of 25%. Gang wars with drive-by shootings resumed in Cochran in September 1991, prompting Gilkey to lead a public violence awareness campaign. 
In 1998 city authorities took over Cochran Gardens, citing tax mismanagement by the tenant association. The buildings, rapidly deteriorated under city management; by 1999 vacancy rate increased from under 10% to one-third and by the end of 2008 all but one of Cochran Gardens buildings have been demolished.
As the co-chair of the New York-based National Congress of Neighborhood Women Gilkey negotiated for government grants helping establishment of tenant management in New York and other cities. 
Gilkey was the subject of an 1993 NBC show "Fired Up! The Bertha Gilkey Story" produced by John Singleton.
Bertha Gilkey also played a prominent role in an attempt by the Metropolitan Planning Council in Chicago to implement Tenant Management in Chicago as documented in a 60 minute documentary entitled "Fired-up Public Housing Is My Home" directed by James R. Martin (Jim Martin). The film was seen nationally on Public Television in 1989 and 1990.

Carlos Jiménez Mabarak

Carlos Jiménez Mabarak (Tacuba, Mexico 1916Mexico City 1994) was a Mexican composer, one of the most prolific Mexican composers of the 20th century.
His music belongs to the transition from the Mexican Nationalism to the Avant garde and uses all musical genres. He composed in a period of almost 60 years.
Life.
He studied in Guatemala, Chile and Belgium. His mother was a writer from Veracruz of Lebanese origin. Mabarak practically spent his childhood outside Mexico. His father died when he was 4. During his youth, he lived in many countries because his mother worked in the diplomatic service. The family moved to Guatemala] when Carlos was 6. They lived near Quetzaltenango and almost three years in the capital. He began his piano lessons in Quetzaltenango with Jesús Castillo. Later they lived for almost 5 years in Santiago de Chile where Carlos studied humanism and continued his music education.
In 1932 the family moved to Belgium. While the rest of the family went to Cuba, Carlos stayed in Brussels for almost five years where he studied radio telephone engineering. In 1933, Carlos entered the Institute of high studies in music in Ixelles, a part of Brussels. There he studied piano with Mme Jacobi and harmony with Nellie Jones. In 1936 he obtained a diploma after winning a piano competition. He did his most important studies of Harmony and Musical Analysis with Marguerite Wouters who was cathedratic of the Royal Conservatoire of Belgium. Returning to Mexico in 1937 he decided to work entirely on music. His teacher in orchestra was Silvestre Revueltas in the National Conservatory of Music of Mexico. In 1942 he was appointed teacher in harmony in the Conservatory and since 1957 he taught composition. In 1945, Carlos Chávez entrusted him a symphony and Mabarak wrote his Symphony in E flat. In 1956 he received a scholarship by the UNESCO. In this period he studied dodecaphonism in Paris with René Leibowitz. Mabarak also began to use magnetophonic techniques in his works. In 1968, his fanfare was elected theme for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico.

North Bank tunnel

The North Bank tunnel concept was a hydroelectric scheme being developed by Meridian Energy on the Waitaki River in Canterbury, New Zealand. The $993 million project is expected to produce an additional 1100 to 1400 GWh pa, and take up to 260 m³/s of water from Lake Waitaki. The project will result in a 275 GWh pa reduction in output from the Waitaki hydro station.
Discovery of geological faultlines prompted rethink of the project, including consideration of using a canal instead of a tunnel.
Work on the project was suspended in January 2013 due to flat demand for electricity forecast for the next five years.
This project is at a similar location to Project Aqua, a hydroelectric power proposal abandoned by Meridian in 2004.
Resource consent process.
In December 2008, Environment Canterbury granted water use consents for this project. Appeals against this decision were made by Ngai Tahu, Ngai Tahu Fishers People Inc, the Lower Waitaki River Management Society and Black Point farmer Garth Dovey. The appeal hearings were held in the Environment Court during June and July 2009, with water rights being granted in September 2009.

Año Nuevo State Marine Conservation Area

Año Nuevo State Marine Conservation Area (SMCA) is one of two adjoining marine protected areas off the coast of San Mateo and Santa Cruz Counties, on California’s central coast.The area is approximately 55 miles south of San Francisco. The SMCA is 11.07 square miles. Except for limited taking of giant kelp, all living marine resources are protected. 
History.
The Año Nuevo SMCA was established in September 2007 by the California Department of Fish and Game. It was one of 29 marine protected areas adopted during the first phase of the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative. The Marine Life Protection Act Initiative (or MLPAI) is a collaborative public process to create a statewide network of marine protected areas along the California coastline. 
The SMCA was designed to protect marine life while keeping nearby favored recreational fishing grounds open to fishing. Important fishing grounds to the north of Point Año Nuevo and from Moss Landing to Davenport remain open to fishing.
Geography and natural features.
Año Nuevo SMCA is adjacent to Ano Nuevo State Park, and includes the waters surrounding Point Ano Nuevo and Ano Nuevo Island. Greyhound Rock State Marine Conservation Area adjoins the site to the south.
This marine protected area is bounded by the mean high tide line and a distance of 200 feet seaward of mean lower low water between the following two points: 
The area then continues southward bounded by the mean high tide line and straight lines connecting the following points in the order listed:
Habitat and wildlife.
Point Año Nuevo is used by thousands of breeding seabirds and marine mammals and supports a world famous elephant seal haul out and breeding ground. The waters surrounding the point attract a concentration of great white sharks and include documented “hotspots” for depleted canary rockfish. Threatened marbled murrelets rest on shore and forage in the lee of the point.
Ano Nuevo SMCA provides habitat for a variety of marine life, and includes rocky intertidal, sandy beach, estuary, offshore rocks and islands, shale reef, bull kelp and giant kelp forest.
Recreation and nearby attractions.
The adjacent State Parks have extensive docent programs (including docent lead tours to the elephant seal colony during the months of December through March in Ano Nuevo State Reserve), outreach and interpretive facilities, parking, and an on-site ranger presence to assist with management and enforcement.
California’s marine protected areas encourage recreational and educational uses of the ocean. Activities such as kayaking, diving, snorkeling, and swimming are allowed unless otherwise restricted.

Scientific monitoring.
As specified by the Marine Life Protection Act, select marine protected areas along California’s central coast are being monitored by scientists to track their effectiveness and learn more about ocean health. Similar studies in marine protected areas located off of the Santa Barbara Channel Islands have already detected gradual improvements in fish size and number.

Chicago Jazz (synchronized skating team)

Chicago Jazz is a synchronized skating team from Chicago.
The Chicago Jazz began its program in 1987, as the Jazz Babies under the direction of Coach Lisa Darken. With a Team of 22 skaters, the Jazz Babies began their climb to perfection and in 1991 became the U.S. Figure Skating Bronze Champions in the Intermediate Division of the U.S. National Precision Championships held in Anchorage, Alaska. The Team kept growing and in 1994 earned entry for all four divisions (80 skaters) to the U.S. Figure Skating National Precision Team Championships in Providence, Rhode Island. Every year since then, the Chicago Jazz has been represented in the U.S. National Championships.
In 1996, the Jazz Babies merged their precision skating program with the Rolling Meadows Rockettes Precision Ice Skating Club. This new family of over 160 Skaters, representing 8 divisions, became known as the Chicago Jazz Precision Ice Skating Club. They utilize skating facilities in Rolling Meadows, Park Ridge, Buffalo Grove and other suburban communities.

Newton-Wellesley Hospital

Newton-Wellesley Hospital (NWH) is a community teaching medical center located in Newton, Massachusetts on Washington Street. It is affiliated with Tufts University School of Medicine and Harvard Medical School. Founded in 1881, its campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Newton Cottage Hospital Historic District.
It is a member of Partners HealthCare, a network founded by Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The Hospital offers a range of medical, surgical and specialty care, including maternity services, a 24-hour emergency department and orthopedic, critical care and oncology inpatient units.
History.
Newton-Wellesley Hospital, originally called Newton Cottage Hospital, was incorporated in 1881. The idea for the hospital began when a local reverend, George W. Shinn, encouraged the mayor of Newton, Royal M. Pulsifer, to provide health care services for sick members of the community. Nine acres were purchased for the building. The hospital opened its doors on June 5, 1886 and admitted its first patient a week later. As a cottage hospital, Newton-Wellesley was built to serve the local population. It consisted of a complex of buildings, radiating from a central administrative building. Patients were cared for in windowed ward rooms, one story high.
A School of Nursing was established at the hospital in 1888. The first baby was born there in 1890 (by 1965, 50,000 babies had been delivered, including the hospital's first in-vitro baby). Newton-Wellesley acquired its first X-ray machine in 1902, and an electrocardiograph in 1933. In 1910, the outpatient department was opened at the hospital. Most outpatient departments at the time consisted of a doctor and a nurse. But Newton-Wellesley offered a variety of services, each attended by a specialist. The department had an orthopedic service, one of only two in the Boston community.
In response to the influx of patients resulting from the combination of World War I and the 1918 influenza pandemic, the hospital erected a number of tents and temporary buildings. Patient records began to be kept in 1920, followed in 1924 by the establishment of an official hospital laboratory for bloodwork and urinalyses; the blood bank was first added in 1939. In 1955, the first pacemaker operation at the hospital was performed, followed by the first cardiac catheterization in 1993. The Wikstrom Surgical Center opened in 1993, providing 16 operating rooms, pre-operative and post-anesthesia areas, and a permanent MRI suite.
In 1999, Newton-Wellesley Hospital joins Partners HealthCare; it affiliated with MassGeneral Hospital for Children in 2001. A number of new centers were created, including the Spine Center (founded by Andrew C. Hecht in 2001), the Waltham Urgent Care Center (2003), and Maxwell Blum Emergency Pavilion (2007) and the Vernon Cancer Center (construction began 2008).
Facilities and current operations.
There are 313 available beds and more than 21,000 discharges every year at Newton-Wellesley Hospital. On average, there are 59,000 visits in the emergency room yearly and more than 3,900 babies born. 15,000 surgical cases are seen each year. The hospital employs approximately 2,500 people.
The main campus of Newton-Wellesley is located at 2014 Washington Street, Newton, Massachusetts, near the intersection of Routes 16 & 128 (I-95), one mile south of the Mass. Pike (I-90). The closest MBTA stop is Woodland, two blocks from the hospital on the D (Riverside) Branch of the MBTA Green Line.
An additional urgent care treatment facility is located offsite at the Waltham Urgent Care Center at 9 Hope Avenue in Waltham, MA. Laboratory Services also has offsite locations in Natick, Walpole, Waltham and Weston.

Charles Winters

Charles "Charlie" Thompson Winters (February 10, 1913 – October 29, 1984) was an American businessman who volunteered during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. He was imprisoned for 18 months for helping smuggle three B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers to Israel in the late 1940s, but pardoned posthumously by President George W. Bush on December 23, 2008.
Early life.
Winters, the Protestant son of Scotch-Canadian and Irish parents, was born in Brookline, Massachusetts in 1913. Polio struck him at an early age, leaving him with a limp. Because of this handicap, the United States Army rejected him during World War II, and he instead spent the war working for the government as a purchasing agent.
Smuggling.
Winters entered the produce export business after the war, buying decommissioned military cargo planes that were being used to transport fruits and vegetables. A friend and flight engineer named Al Schwimmer, known as the father of the Israeli air force, enlisted Winters in his efforts to supply aircraft to Jewish fighters in Israel; with his government experience, Winters managed to smuggle three B-17 bombers to Israel. Taking off from Miami, the two B-17s refueled in Puerto Rico, as if completing a normal shipping route, but instead flew to Israel by way of the Azores and Czechoslovakia; a third B-17 joined the group in Czechoslovakia. They constituted the newly created Israeli Air Force's first heavy bombers. Winters was said to have decided to help supply the Israeli forces as a favor to his Jewish friends, and received no monetary compensation for the work. His efforts gained him the nickname "The Godfather of the Israeli Airforce"
The three bombers smuggled by Winters were the only heavy bombers in the Israeli Air Force during the war, but were reportedly essential in turning the tide of war in Israel's favor. In his diary on July 16, 1948, David Ben-Gurion noted their arrival in Israel, and mentioned that they had already been used for several bombing runs in Egypt. They formed 69 Squadron of the Israeli Air Force, known as the "Hammers".
Winters was subsequently prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney in Miami for violating the Neutrality Act of 1939 in conspiring to smuggle three bombers via Czechoslovakia to Palestine. Winters was found guilty, fined $5000, spent 18 months in prison, and was finally released on November 17, 1949. Schwimmer, though convicted, was not sentenced to prison, and was pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2000. Another man in the operation, Herman Greenspun, was also convicted with no prison time, and pardoned in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy.
Later life.
At the time of his death, Winters was married to the former Joan Babineau and had two children with her, Lisa and James (Jimi). His sons Charles Todd and Charles Jr. were from previous marriages. He never told his children about his smuggling or prison time, and his son Jimi recounted that the first hint he ever had of something in his father's past was when his father admitted to him that he couldn't buy a gun. In 1961 he received a letter from then Foreign Affairs Minister Golda Meir, commending him for his efforts and inviting him to the opening of a new memorial in Israel. Winters lived the rest of his life in Miami, where he founded an export firm. He died there October 30, 1984 and his ashes were buried in a Christian cemetery near Jerusalem's Knights Templar cemetery as well as scattered from Mount Tabor.
Pardon.
Winters' son James, along with his close childhood friend Frank Jimenez, began campaigning for his father's pardon after his death, receiving the support of, among others, 21 Congressmen, the American Jewish Committee, and Steven Spielberg. President Bush officially pardoned Winters on December 23, 2008. Democratic Representative Ron Klein, who led the congressional group, commented that "President Bush made the right decision today to issue a posthumous pardon to Charles Winters, a Florida resident who played an essential role in the creation of the state of Israel."
Winter's lawyer, Wilmer Hale partner Reginald Brown, stated, "He did a heroic thing and, at the time, the law didn’t reflect our values. The pardon is a way of the law catching up with the history." His son James responded to the pardon, saying, "This is a present for my father...It was a monumental challenge, but my dad used to always say ‘Keep the faith,’ and we did". Winters' pardon constituted the first posthumous pardon since Henry Ossian Flipper in 1999.

Texas in My Soul

Texas in My Soul is a 1968 album by country singer Willie Nelson. It was an early concept album that aimed to pay tribute to the State of Texas. The original album artwork features the Alamo, along with three San Antonio construction projects completed in 1968: the Tower of the Americas, HemisFair Arena and the HemisFair monorail system. All of these projects for HemisFair '68 were constructed by a joint venture of two general contractors: Gerald Lyda's Darragh & Lyda Inc. of San Antonio, Texas and the Houston-based H. A. Lott Inc.
"Dallas" was co-written by Dallas-based music promoter Dewey Groom who owned and operated the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas where Nelson regularly played.
"Texas in My Soul" was written in the late 1940s by Ernest Tubb and Zeb Turner, along with an uncredited Justin Tubb, Ernest's eleven-year-old son. While singles were cut and released by Tex Williams and Hank Penny, Ernest never recorded the song.
"San Antonio" became Nelson's sixth RCA Victor single, peaking at #50, but lingering on the charts for nine weeks. The song was written by San Antonio steel guitar player Jerry Blanton who performed with George Chambers and the Country Gentlemen. Chambers and his band had recently backed up Nelson for four weeks in Las Vegas.
"The Hill Country Theme" was written by Cindy Walker for Texas Hill Country-born Lyndon B. Johnson, who was President of the United States at the time. The song was adopted as Johnson's official theme song. Arthur Fielder and the Boston Pops recorded a symphonic version of the song which was included on one of their RCA Victor albums.
"Waltz Across Texas" was written by Ernest Tubb. This album marked the first time that Nelson recorded the song. Producer Pete Drake produced the 1978 Ernest Tubb tribute album, "The Legend and the Legacy" which featured a duet between Tubb and Nelson.

Stanley A. McChrystal

Stanley Allen McChrystal (born August 14, 1954)
is a retired United States Army General. His last assignment was as Commander, International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Commander, U.S. Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A). He previously served as Director, Joint Staff from August 2008 to June 2009 and as Commander, Joint Special Operations Command from 2003 to 2008, where he was credited with the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, but also criticized for his alleged role in the cover-up of the Pat Tillman friendly fire incident. McChrystal was reportedly known for saying and thinking what other military leaders were afraid to; this was one of the reasons cited for his appointment to lead all forces in Afghanistan. He held the post from June 15, 2009, to June 23, 2010.
Following unflattering remarks about Vice President Joe Biden and other administration officials attributed to McChrystal and his aides in a "Rolling Stone" article, McChrystal was recalled to Washington, D.C., where President Barack Obama accepted his resignation as commander in Afghanistan. His command of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan was immediately assumed by the deputy commander, British General Sir Nicholas "Nick" Parker, pending the confirmation of a replacement. Obama named General David Petraeus as McChrystal's replacement; Petraeus was confirmed by the Senate and officially assumed command on June 30. Days after being relieved of his duties in Afghanistan, McChrystal announced his retirement.
Early career.
McChrystal graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1976 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army. His initial assignment was to C Company, 1st Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division, serving as weapons platoon leader from November 1976 to February 1978, as rifle platoon leader from February 1978 to July 1978, and as executive officer from July 1978 to November 1978.
In November 1978, McChrystal enrolled as a student in the Special Forces Officer Course at the Special Forces School at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Upon completing the course in April 1979, he remained at Fort Bragg as commander of an SFOD-A Special Forces Operational Detachment — Alpha (or "A-team") in A Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) until June 1980, when he attended the Infantry Officer Advanced Course at the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, until February 1981.
In February 1981, McChrystal moved to South Korea as intelligence and operations officer (S-2/S-3) for the United Nations Command Support Group—Joint Security Area. He reported to Fort Stewart, Georgia, in March 1982 to serve as training officer in the Directorate of Plans and Training, A Company, Headquarters Command. He moved to 3rd Battalion, 19th Infantry, 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized), in November 1982, where he commanded A Company before becoming battalion operations officer (S-3) in September 1984.
McChrystal moved to 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, as battalion liaison officer in September 1985, became commander of A Company in January 1986, served again as battalion liaison officer in May 1987, and finally became battalion operations officer (S-3) in April 1988, before reporting to the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, as a student in the Command and General Staff Course in June 1989. It was during this time that McChrystal also completed a Master of Science degree in international relations from Salve Regina University. After completing the course in June 1990, he was assigned as Army Special Operations action officer, J-3, Joint Special Operations Command until April 1993, in which capacity he deployed to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.
From April 1993 to November 1994, McChrystal commanded the 2nd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division. He then commanded the 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, from November 1994 to June 1996. During this time he initiated what would become a complete revamping of the existing Army hand-to-hand combat curricula. After a year as a senior service college fellow at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, he moved up to command the entire 75th Ranger Regiment from June 1997 to August 1999, then spent another year as a military fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
General officer.
Promoted to brigadier general on January 1, 2001, he served as assistant division commander (operations) of the 82nd Airborne Division from June 2000 to June 2001, including duty as Commander, United States Army Central (dubbed "Coalition/Joint Task Force Kuwait") in Camp Doha, Kuwait. From June 2001 to July 2002 he was chief of staff of XVIII Airborne Corps, including duty as chief of staff of Combined Joint Task Force 180, the headquarters formation contributed by XVIII Airborne Corps to direct all Operation Enduring Freedom operations in Afghanistan.
At the beginning of the Iraq War in March 2003, he was serving in the Pentagon as a member of the Joint Staff, where he had been vice director of operations, J-3, since July 2002. McChrystal was selected to deliver nationally televised Pentagon briefings on U.S. military operations in Iraq, including one in April 2003 shortly after the fall of Baghdad in which he announced, ""I would anticipate that the major combat engagements are over.""
Commander, Joint Special Operations Command.
He commanded the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) for five years, serving first as Commanding General, Joint Special Operations Command, from September 2003 to February 2006, and then as Commander, Joint Special Operations Command/Commander, Joint Special Operations Command Forward, from February 2006 to August 2008. Nominally assigned to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, he spent most of his time in Afghanistan, at U.S. Central Command's forward headquarters in Qatar, and in Iraq. In Iraq, he personally directed special operations, where his work there is viewed as "pivotal". Early successes included the capture by JSOC forces of Saddam Hussein in December 2003. He was promoted to lieutenant general on February 16, 2006.
As head of what "Newsweek" termed "the most secretive force in the U.S. military", McChrystal maintained a very low profile until June 2006, when his forces were responsible for the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. After McChrystal's team successfully located Zarqawi and called in the airstrike that killed him, McChrystal accompanied his men to the bombed-out hut near Baqubah to personally identify the body.
McChrystal's Zarqawi unit, Task Force 6-26, became well known for its interrogation methods, particularly at Camp Nama, where it was accused of abusing detainees. After the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal became public in April 2004, 34 members of the task force were disciplined.
McChrystal was also criticized for his role in the aftermath of the 2004 death by friendly fire of Ranger and former professional football player Pat Tillman. Within a day of Tillman's death, McChrystal was notified that Tillman was a victim of friendly fire. Shortly thereafter, McChrystal was put in charge of paperwork to award Tillman a posthumous Silver Star for valor. On April 28, 2004, six days after Tillman's death, McChrystal approved a final draft of the Silver Star recommendation and submitted it to the acting Secretary of the Army, even though the medal recommendation deliberately omitted any mention of friendly fire, included the phrase "in the line of devastating enemy fire", and was accompanied by fabricated witness statements. On April 29, McChrystal sent an urgent memo warning White House speechwriters not to quote the medal recommendation in any statements they wrote for President Bush because it "might cause public embarrassment if the circumstances of Corporal Tillman's death become public." McChrystal was one of the first to caution restraint in public statements, until the investigation was complete. McChrystal was one of eight officers recommended for discipline by a subsequent Pentagon investigation but the Army declined to take action against him.
According to Pulitzer Prize-winning "Washington Post" reporter Bob Woodward, beginning in late spring 2007 JSOC and CIA Special Activities Division teams launched a new series of highly effective covert operations that coincided with the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. They did this by killing or capturing many of the key al-Qa'ida leaders in Iraq. In a CBS "60 Minutes" interview, Woodward described a new special operations capability that allowed for this success, noting that it was developed by the joint teams of CIA and JSOC. Several senior U.S. officials stated that the "joint efforts of JSOC and CIA paramilitary units were the most significant contributor to the defeat of al-Qa'ida in Iraq." Journalist Peter Bergen also credits McChrystal with transforming and modernizing JSOC into a "force of unprecedented agility and lethality," playing a key factor in the success of JSOC efforts in subsequent years and in the success of the war in Iraq.
Director, Joint Staff.
McChrystal was considered a candidate to succeed General Bryan D. Brown as commander of U.S. Special Operations Command in 2007, and to succeed General David Petraeus as commanding general of Multi-National Force – Iraq or Admiral William J. Fallon as commander of U.S. Central Command in 2008, all four-star positions. Instead, McChrystal was nominated by George W. Bush to succeed Lieutenant General Walter L. Sharp as director of the Joint Staff in February 2008, another three-star position.
Normally a routine process, McChrystal's Senate confirmation was stalled by members of the Senate Armed Services Committee who sought more information about the alleged mistreatment of detainees by Special Operations troops under McChrystal's command in Iraq and Afghanistan. After meeting with McChrystal in private, the Senate Armed Services Committee confirmed his reappointment as lieutenant general in May 2008 and he became Director of the Joint Staff in August 2008.
Commander of US and ISAF forces in Afghanistan.
With his June 10, 2009, Senate approval to take command in Afghanistan, McChrystal was promoted to general. Shortly after McChrystal assumed command of NATO operations, Operation Khanjar commenced, marking the largest offensive operation and the beginning of the deadliest combat month for NATO forces since 2001.
Afghanistan assessment made public.
McChrystal submitted a 66-page report to Defense Secretary Robert Gates calling for more troops in Afghanistan, saying "We are going to win." That became public on September 20, 2009. McChrystal warned that the war in Afghanistan may be lost if more troops are not sent, but the report ends on a note of cautious optimism: "While the situation is serious, success is still achievable."
Recommended troop increases.
In 2009, McChrystal publicly suggested between 30,000 and 40,000 more troops were needed in Afghanistan, as the lowest risk option out of a number of possible troop level changes. McChrystal was advised by White House Staff not to present troop increases numbers to "defeat the Taliban", but to "degrade" them.
Scott Ritter, former Chief UN Weapons Inspector in Iraq, has stated that McChrystal should be fired for insubordination for disclosing information that he should have said only in private to the President of the United States.
The New York Magazine refers to the leaked report as the "McChrystal risk" as it boxed Obama into a corner about boosting troop levels in Afghanistan.
"Rolling Stone" article and resignation.
In an article written by freelance journalist Michael Hastings, ("The Runaway General", appearing in "Rolling Stone" magazine, July 8–22, 2010 issue), McChrystal and his staff mocked civilian government officials, including Joe Biden, National Security Advisor James L. Jones, US Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl W. Eikenberry, and Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke. McChrystal was not quoted as being directly critical of the president or the president's policies, but several comments from his aides in the article reflected their perception of McChrystal's disappointment with Obama on the first two occasions of their meeting. According to Rolling Stone, McChrystal's staff was contacted prior to release of the article and did not deny the validity of the article, though senior members of his staff dispute this, and have accused Hastings in "Army Times" of exaggerating the seniority of aides quoted and breaking the "off the record" trust of private conversations. Hastings told Newsweek that he was quite clearly a reporter gathering material, and actually bemused at the degree to which soldiers were free when speaking to him.
The statements attributed to McChrystal and members of his staff drew the attention of the White House when McChrystal called Biden to apologize. McChrystal issued a written statement, saying: 
Biden's call to tell him of the apology prompted Obama to request a copy of the profile and then to summon McChrystal to attend in person the president's monthly security team meeting at the White House in lieu of attending via secure video teleconference. During a brief (less than 20 minutes) meeting with Obama on June 23, two days before the article was released to newsstands and only one day after it was released online, McChrystal tendered his resignation, which the president accepted. Shortly thereafter, Obama nominated General David Petraeus to replace McChrystal in his role as top commander in Afghanistan. Obama's statement on the topic began as follows: ""Today I accepted Gen. Stanley McChrystal's resignation as commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. I did so with considerable regret, but also with certainty that it is the right thing for our mission in Afghanistan, for our military and for our country.""
Later that day McChrystal released the following statement:
Retirement.
Shortly after his removal from command in Afghanistan, McChrystal announced that he would retire from the Army. The day after the announcement, the White House announced that he would retain his four-star rank in retirement, although law generally requires a four-star officer to hold his rank for three years in order to retain it in retirement. His retirement ceremony was held on July 23, 2010, at Fort McNair in Washington D.C. During this ceremony, McChrystal was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Casey and the Defense Distinguished Service Medal by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates.
Pentagon inquiry.
Hastings and Eric Bates, executive editor of "Rolling Stone", repeatedly defended the accuracy of Hastings' article. An inquiry by the Defense Department inspector general has found no proof of wrongdoing by General McChrystal or his military and civilian associates. The Pentagon report also challenged the accuracy of Mr. Hastings' article "The Runaway General," disputing key incidents or comments reported in Hastings' article. The report from the inquiry states: "In some instances, we found no witness who acknowledged making or hearing the comments as reported. In other instances, we confirmed that the general substance of an incident at issue occurred, but not in the exact context described in the article." In response, "Rolling Stone" stated that “The report by the Pentagon’s inspector general offers no credible source — or indeed, any named source — contradicting the facts as reported in our story, 'The Runaway General.'" After the report was made public, the White House tapped McChrystal to head a new advisory board to support military families, an initiative led by First Lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden, wife of the vice president. The selection of McChrystal was announced on April 12, four days after the inspector general's report was finished.
Post-military career.
In 2010, after leaving the Army, McChrystal joined Yale University as a Jackson Institute for Global Affairs senior fellow. He teaches a course entitled "Leadership," a graduate-level seminar with some spots reserved for undergraduates. The course received 250 applications for 20 spots in 2011 and is being taught for a third time in 2013.
In November 2010, JetBlue Airways announced that McChrystal would join its board of directors. On February 16, 2011, Navistar International announced that McChrystal would join its board of directors. He is also Chairman of the Board of Siemens Government Systems, and is on the strategic advisory board of Knowledge International, a licensed arms dealer whose parent company is EAI, a business "very close" to the United Arab Emirates government.
McChrystal co-founded and is a partner at the McChrystal Group LLC, an Alexandria, Virginia-based consulting firm.
In 2011, McChrystal advocated instituting a national service program in the United States. McChrystal stated, "'Service member' should not apply only to those in uniform, but to us all ... America is falling short in endeavors that occur far away from any battlefield: education, science, politics, the environment, and cultivating leadership, among others. Without a sustained focus on these foundations of our society, America’s long-term security and prosperity are at risk."
McChrystal's memoir, "My Share of the Task", published by Portfolio of the Penguin Group, was released on January 7, 2013. The autobiography had been scheduled to be released in November 2012, but was delayed due to security clearance approvals required from the Department of Defense. Portfolio publishers stated, "We have decided to delay the publication date of General McChrystal's book, "My Share of the Task", as the book continues to undergo a security review by the Department of Defense ... General McChrystal has spent 22 months working closely with military officials to make sure he follows all the rules for writing about the armed forces, including special operations."
On January 8, 2013, McChrystal appeared on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program, where he endorsed stronger U.S. gun control laws, saying that assault weapons were for the battlefield, not schools or streets.
Personal life.
McChrystal is the son of Mary Gardner Bright and Major General Herbert J. McChrystal, Jr., and was the fourth child in a family of five boys and a girl, all of whom would serve in the military or marry military spouses. His older brother, Colonel Scott McChrystal, is a retired Army chaplain, and is the endorsing agent for the Assemblies of God.
McChrystal married his wife Annie in April 1977, and the couple has one adult son, Sam. McChrystal is reported to run daily, eat one meal per day, and sleep four hours a night.

Pow Burn

The Pow Burn is a long burn located in South Ayrshire, Scotland. The name 'Pow or 'Poll' refers to a slow-moving ditch-like stream.
Location.
The Pow Burn is fed by a small loch near the estate of Coodham and is narrow until it reaches Prestwick, where it starts to widen. The Burn separates Prestwick and Monkton. It crosses Prestwick Airport and flows through Prestwick Golf Course, where is serves as a natural obstacle. A caravan park has been built at the mouth, where it flows into the Firth of Clyde. 
The Ayrshire Cycle Track runs over the burn near the estuary. 
Mills.
At one time there were four mills operating on the Pow Burn. Near the mouth was Prestwick Mill, later called Monkton Mill. Upstream were Powbank, situated near Monkton, Adamton Mill and, ¾ mile east of Symington, Helenton Mill. The small tributary from Barnweil Loch had also the Heugh Mill.
Powbank Mill closed at the outbreak of World War II, when it was requisitioned as a Canteen/Naafi. After the war, the mill never returned to the family, being the home of the Scottish Aviation Club, before they moved into the St Cuthbert's site on Kirk Street.
Wildlife.
The Burn is one of the last coastal wildlife havens in South Ayrshire. Parts are designated as a Wildlife Corridor and as a Wildlife Site. It has locally rare habitats and nationally rare species.
Plants and animals been sighted at the Pow include sea otters, red admiral, rare dragonflys and songbirds such as thrush and nightingale. There has been a decline in the number of waxwings migrating to the area. 
The Pow Burn is managed by the local council for conservation and recreation. It provides an area where families can picnic beside the burn and play on the sand dunes west of the burn. The dunes were once a sand quarry.

Jerry Fahr

Gerald Warren Fahr (December 9, 1924 – February 12, 2010) was an American professional baseball player, a right-handed pitcher who played in the minor leagues from 1947–1956, with the exception of a five-game Major League trial as a relief pitcher for the Cleveland Indians during the 1951 season. Born in Marmaduke, Arkansas, he stood tall and weighed .
Fahr was treated roughly during his Major League debut, allowing three hits, a base on balls and two earned runs in one inning pitched against the St. Louis Browns on April 29, 1951 — a wild, 13–11 St. Louis victory. However, in his final four games and 4⅔ innings pitched, he allowed only one additional run. Fahr gave up eight hits and a walk during those final games, but induced four batters to hit into double plays.

<doc id="20821742" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20821742" title="2000s in the music industry">
2000s in the music industry

In the first decade of the 21st century, the rise of computers as the primary means to record, distribute, store, and play music caused widespread economic changes in the music industry, fundamentally changing the relationships between artists, record companies, promoters, retail music stores, the technology industry, and consumers. The rise of digital music consumption options contributed to a few fundamental changes in consumption. First the decline of album sales. With the A la carte sales models increasing in popularity, consumers no longer download entire albums but rather choose single songs.
The initial stage (from approximately 1998 to 2001) of the digital music revolution was the emergence of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks that allowed the free exchange of music files (such as Kazaa and Napster). By 2001, the cost of hard drive space had dropped to a level that allowed pocket-sized computers to store large libraries of music. The iPod and iTunes system for music storage and playback became immensely popular, and many consumers began to transfer their physical recording media (such as CDs) onto computer hard drives. The iTunes Music Store offered legal downloads beginning in 2003, and competitors soon followed, offering a variety of online music services, such as internet radio. Digital music distribution was aided by the widespread acceptance of broadband in the middle of the decade. At the same time, recording software (such as Avid's Pro Tools) began to be used almost exclusively to make records, rendering expensive multitrack tape machines (such as the 1967 Studer) almost obsolete.
The chief economic impact of these changes was a dramatic decline in revenues from recorded music. In the 21st century, consumers spent far less money on recorded music than they had in 1990s, in all formats. Total revenues for CDs, vinyl, cassettes and digital downloads in the U.S. dropped from a high of $14.6 billion in 1999 to $9 billion in 2008.
The popularity of internet music distribution has increased and by 2007 more units were sold over the internet than in any other form.
However, as "The Economist" reported, "paid digital downloads grew rapidly, but did not begin to make up for the loss of revenue from CDs."
The 2000s period stands in stark contrast from the "CD boom" of 1984-1995, when profit margins averaged above 30% and industry executives were notorious for their high profile, even frivolous spending.
The major record labels consistently failed to heed warnings or to support any measures that embraced the change in technology. In the early years of the decade, the industry fought illegal file sharing, successfully shutting down Napster in 2001 and threatening thousands of individuals with legal action. This failed to slow the decline in revenue and was a public relations disaster. Some academic studies have even suggested that downloads were not the true cause of the decline.
The turmoil in the industry changed the balance of power among all the various players. The major music-only stores such as Tower Records (which once wielded considerable influence in the industry) went bankrupt, replaced by box stores (such as Wal-Mart and Best Buy). Recording artists began to rely primarily on live performances and merchandise for their income, which in turn made them more dependent on music promoters such as Live Nation (which dominates tour promotion and owns a large number of music venues.)
In order to benefit from all of an artist's income streams, record companies began to rely on the "360 deal", a new business relationship pioneered by Robbie Williams and EMI in 2007.
At the other extreme, record companies also used simple manufacturing and distribution deals, which gives a higher percentage to the artist, but does not cover the expense of marketing and promotion. Many newer artists no longer see any kind of "record deal" as an integral part of their business plan at all. Inexpensive recording hardware and software made it possible to create high quality music in a bedroom and distribute it over the internet to a worldwide audience.
This, in turn, caused problems for recording studios, record producers and audio engineers: the "Los Angeles Times" reported that, by 2009, as many as half of the recording facilities in that city had failed.
Consumers benefited enormously from the ease with which music can be shared from computer to computer, whether over the internet or by the exchange of physical CDs. This has given consumers unparalleled choice in music consumption and has opened up performers to niche markets to which they previously had little access. According to a Nielsen and Billboard report, in 2012 digital music sales topped the physical sale of music.
Peer-to-peer (P2P) downloading.
Dawn of P2P: Napster.
Napster was an online music file sharing service created by Shawn Fanning while he was attending Northeastern University in Boston and operating between June 1999 and July 2001. Its technology allowed people to easily copy and distribute MP3 files among each other, bypassing the established market for such songs and thus leading to the music industry's accusations of massive copyright violations.
The first peer-to-peer case was A&M Records v. Napster, 239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001). The court found that Napster was contributory liable for the copyright infringement of its end-users because it "knowingly encourages and assists the infringement of plaintiffs' copyrights." Although the original service was shut down by court order, it paved the way for larger decentralized peer-to-peer file-distribution programs such as Kazaa, Morpheus, Grokster, iMesh, and Limewire, which have been much harder to control because they practice more technically and legally creative approaches.
File sharing and its effects.
A number of studies have found that file sharing has a negative impact on record sales. Examples of such studies include three papers published in the April 2006 issue of the Journal of Law and Economics (Liebowitz, Rob and Waldfogel, Zentner). Alejandro Zentner notes in another paper published in 2005, that music sales have globally dropped from approximately $38 billion in 1999 to $32 billion in 2003, and that this downward trend coincides with the advent of Napster in June 1999. Using aggregate data Stan J. Liebowitz argues in a series of papers (2005, 2012) that file sharing had a significant negative impact on record sales.
In March 2007 the Wall Street Journal found that CD sales have dropped 20 percent in one year, which the Wall Street Journal interpreted as the latest sign of the shift in the way people acquire their music. BigChampagne LLC has reported that around one billion songs a month are being traded on illegal file-sharing networks. As a result of this decline in CD sales, a significant amount of record stores are going out of business and “...making it harder for consumers to find and purchase older titles in stores.”
On 19 December 2008, the Wall Street Journal reported the following:
After years of suing thousands of people for allegedly stealing music via the Internet, the recording industry is set to drop its legal assault as it searches for more effective ways to combat online music piracy.The decision represents an abrupt shift of strategy for the industry, which has opened legal proceedings against about 35,000 people since 2003. Critics say the legal offensive ultimately did little to stem the tide of illegally downloaded music. And it created a public-relations disaster for the industry, whose lawsuits targeted, among others, several single mothers, a dead person and a 13-year-old girl. Instead, the Recording Industry Association of America said it plans to try an approach that relies on the cooperation of Internet-service providers.
Digital business models.
With the explosion of formats and the creation of legitimate digital content, the IFPI observed that three main business models have risen to dominance. They are a-la-carte, subscription service, and advertisement-based.
A-la-carte (Download Store).
A-la-carte is a service that sells individual songs, typically for $0.99 and now $1.29. They are known to consumers as "Download Stores". The leading provider is iTunes Store (Apple Inc.), who surpassed Wal-Mart to become the US’s largest music retailer in April 2008. Sector leaders include:
Many hundreds more stores operate worldwide, often prominent only in particular countries or specialist genres. A third kind of operator never retails directly to the public, instead offering branded whitelabel stores and portals for organisations including bricks-and-mortar music stores, mobile telephony operators and ISPs.
Some services which initially only offered streaming of tracks now also offer a-la-carte downloads, either through third parties (e.g. Spotify) or fully integrated (Deezer, Juno Digital, Rhapsody etc.).
In 2009 Rolling Stone reported a price war between iTunes and Amazon MP3. Bill Carr, vice president of digital media for Amazon.com mentioned the following of digital music "one of the great benefits of the digital business versus the CD business is that we can experiment with price changes for an hour, a day or however long we like, with no impact on inventory".
Subscription service.
A subscription service offers the consumer unlimited downloads for a monthly fee. This approach, according to the Open Music Model, is theorized to maximize revenues in the long run. The sector leader is Napster, which costs $12.95/month and offers 6 million downloads and now offers a $5 a month program. Napster’s net revenue for the quarter ending on 30 June 2008 was $30.3 million. Sector leaders include:
Advertisement-based service.
Advertisement-based services offer music free of charge to the consumer, while funding is derived from advertisement. The model is widespread as seen by the success of AOL Music, Yahoo! Music and YouTube (multimedia provider). Many of these services are internet radio stations, as they offer continuous streaming music, while others are not continuously streaming. Many of these services offer multimedia or additional services. For example, MySpace(owned by Fox Interactive Media) offers social-networking as its flagship service. comScore reports the top 10 in internet radio viewership in the United States:
Other sector players:
"See also List of Internet stations
YouTube (owned by Google Inc.) is the premier site for finding music videos for both independent bands and mainstream bands that have released their music on CD or digitally, while also being useful for finding rare songs. YouTube is a multimedia provider, so it is difficult to say how much entertainment it has provided to music consumers, however it did provide about one-third of all 11 billion online video views in the US in the month of April 2008.
The site is also testing three new landing pages dedicated to the popular categories of news, movies, and music. Each page will be populated with the most popular content on the site related to that category. Some have even hailed YouTube as being the "digital successor to MTV" as they seem to be positioning themselves in that manner. Currently, they have mixed relations with labels as evidenced by their icy relationship with Warner Music Group but more optimistic relationship with Universal Music.
MySpace (owned by Fox Interactive Media) is also a key player and Rolling Stone reports that it hosts more than 70 million users monthly and that “visitors to the site can hear both Bob Dylan’s or The White Stripes' entire catalogue”. Unlike many services, MySpace has been successful in making copyright deals with the RIAA's "Big Four", which is Sony BMG, Warner Music Group, Universal Music and EMI, in September 2008. In January 2009, MySpace made partnerships with the following independent labels: Nettwerk, INgrooves, Iris Distribution, RoyaltyShare, and Wind-up Entertainment. In March 2009, CNET News reported that there are more than 5 million bands with music on the streaming-and-discovery music service, and more than 100 million playlists have been created.
Pandora Internet Radio is distinctive from both YouTube and MySpace in that it offers consumers continuously streaming media rather than non-continuous music, which makes it highly similar to terrestrial radio or television. However, it can be contrasted with radio in that it offers music recommendation. YouTube is similar to Pandora in that it also offers recommendation, but is distinct in that content is user-generated.
A new type of service that has also become popular is sites that allow consumers to pay what they wish or pay by advertising on social networking sites. Sites like Noisetrade.com and comeandlive.com are examples of sites that sponsor artists and allow users to download music in exchange for advertising for the artist. Music is essentially free to users essentially costing only the time it takes to post information about the artist downloaded on Facebook, Twitter, or email. Another example was the release of the most recent Radiohead album "In Rainbows" in which users could download the album and name their own price. The idea of pay what you want music consumption is new, but catching on with users and growing.
Format issues.
Decline of analog, rise of digital.
This trend has broader implications in the use of formats. It has been a trend in music, television, movies, and print.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) reported data on the music industry’s sales by format over the ten-year period from 1998 until 2007. The data in the table below is from the 2007 report.
Format Market share
"Note: These figures represent data collected only from RIAA member labels, which constitutes only a portion of total online music exchanged."
Statistical analysis suggests the large-scale change in distribution:
In 2008, physical album sales fell 20 percent to 362.6 million from 450.5 million, while digital album sales rose 32 percent to a record 65.8 million units.
Proliferation of formats.
The advent of digital media has led to the sudden creation of many new music formats available to the average consumer. In 2003 there were less than 10 formats available, but by 2007 there were over 100. Today a single artist release can be packaged in multiple formats including video downloads, ringtones or mobile full tracks. As the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) notes:
Five years ago music distribution formats were numbered in single figures – today, they number in the hundreds…In the digital era, record companies are licensing music across a multitude of platforms, in scores of different formats and with hundreds of different partners.
Mobile music.
MP3 players.
Rise of MP3 players, which are consumer electronics devices that stores, organizes and plays audio files. Some DAPs (digital audio players) are also referred to as portable media players as they have image-viewing and/or video-playing support. The first mass-produced DAP was created in 1997 by SaeHan Information Systems, which domestically sold its “MPMan” player in the middle of 1998. In October 2001, Apple Computer (now known as Apple Inc.) unveiled the first generation iPod, the 5 GB hard drive based DAP with a 1.8" Toshiba drive. With the development of a minimalistic user interface and a smaller form factor, the iPod was initially notable within users of the Macintosh community. In July 2002, Apple introduced the second generation update to the iPod. It was compatible with Windows computers through Musicmatch Jukebox (now known as Y!Music Musicmatch Jukebox). The iPod series, which grew to include microdrive and flash-based players, has become the market leader in DAPs.
Smartphones.
The 21st century saw the birth of 3G enabled mobile phones, which enables network operators to offer users a wider range of more advanced services while achieving greater network capacity through improved spectral efficiency.
The key advantage of 3G enabled phones over MP3 players is their greater web integration. This enables users to readily access a far larger quantity of songs than MP3 player users can. For an MP3 player, songs must be stored before the user leaves their computer, but with 3G enabled phones the device is not separated from the source. It is projected that revenue from mobile media and entertainment (MME) services in the US will more than double during the next five years.

Carmel Bay State Marine Conservation Area

Carmel Bay State Marine Conservation Area (SMCA) is a marine protected area in Carmel Bay. Carmel Bay is adjacent to the city of Carmel-by-the-Sea and is near Monterey, on California’s central coast. The marine protected area covers 2.12 square miles. Recreational fishing of finfish and limited commercial taking of kelp is permitted within the SMCA.
History.
The Carmel Bay SMCA was established in September 2007 by the California Fish and Game Commission. It was one of 29 marine protected areas adopted during the first phase of the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative. The Marine Life Protection Act Initiative (or MLPAI) is a collaborative public process to create a statewide network of marine protected areas along the California coastline. 
The Carmel Bay SMCA encourages recreational fishing opportunities in an area close to a nearby port by precluding commercial extraction or take of invertebrates throughout the Bay but allowing sport fishing for finfish from shore, kayak, or boat.
Geography and natural features.
Carmel Bay (SMCA) is near Carmel Pinnacles State Marine Reserve, Point Lobos State Marine Reserve and Point Lobos State Marine Conservation Area. On opposite sides of Carmel Bay are the only two extant stands of Monterey Cypress, "Cupressus macrocarpa".
This marine protected area is bounded by the mean high tide line and straight lines connecting the following points in the order listed:

Habitat and wildlife.
Habitats protected by Carmel Bay SMCA include kelp forest, sandy beach, submarine canyon head, and surfgrass.
Recreation and nearby attractions.
Carmel Bay is a tourism and ocean recreation destination. Divers and kayakers are attracted to its unique pinnacle formations, granite reefs and kelp forests. Carmel-By-The-Sea also features an iconic white sand beach.
In nearby Monterey, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is a major tourist attraction featuring a living kelp forest. The exhibit includes many of the species native to the nearby marine protected areas. The aquarium also houses sea otters, intertidal wildlife, and occasionally sea turtles.
California’s marine protected areas encourage recreational and educational uses of the ocean. Activities such as kayaking, diving, snorkeling, and swimming are allowed unless otherwise restricted.
Scientific monitoring.
As specified by the Marine Life Protection Act, select marine protected areas along California’s central coast are being monitored by scientists to track their effectiveness and learn more about ocean health. Similar studies in marine protected areas located off of the Santa Barbara Channel Islands have already detected gradual improvements in fish size and number.

2004 Dhaka grenade attack

The 2004 Dhaka grenade attack was an attempt to kill Sheikh Hasina, the then-former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, on 21 August 2004. The attack left at least 23 dead and injured many others, except Hasina.
Events and casualties.
Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina had been speaking at a rally protesting blasts against the party's workers in Sylhet. The rally drew a crowd of 15,000 people. As Hasina finished her speech, a total of 13 grenades were thrown into the crowd from the rooftops of nearby buildings, killing at least 23 people and injuring more than 200. Among the dead were Hasina's bodyguard and Awami League Women's Affairs Secretary Ivy Rahman.
Perpetrators.
Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HUJI) leader Mufti Abdul Hannan was arrested for the grenade attacks in 2007, and was later charged in connection with it. He reportedly confessed (although no evidence was ever found) to the attacks in November 2007. He was sentenced to death in December 2008 for attempting to kill Anwar Choudhury in 2004. In March 2012, the son of opposition leader Khaleda Zia, Tarique Rahman, and 28 others were tried in absentia for their alleged involvement in the attack.
Aftermath.
The Awami League called for a massive hartal the day after the attacks.

Wildlife Aid Foundation

The Wildlife Aid Foundation is a charity dedicated to the rescue, care and rehabilitation of sick, injured and orphaned animals. Based in Leatherhead, Surrey, UK, the centre operates Surrey County's only wildlife hospital (one of the three largest such hospitals in the UK) and maintains a referral service for wildlife hospitals throughout Europe. The organisation also carries out environmental activist and educational roles. Wildlife Aid has attracted media attention for its rescues of photogenic wild animals like young foxes and baby badgers; Animal Planet's TV program Wildlife SOS chronicles the activities of Wildlife Aid volunteers as they rescue imperiled animals. 
Wildlife hospital.
Wildlife Aid got its start in 1979 when its founder, Simon Cowell MBE, acquired a farmhouse in Leatherhead with the intent of running a local wildlife rescue facility. Formally established a year later, the centre's activities steadily increased in scale; the hospital now treats more than 20,000 wild animals a year, returning 70% of them to the wild. It has saved the lives of more than 150,000 animals since the charity's formation in 1980. The organisation currently operates on a budget of £350,000 per year, and relies on over 200 volunteers to provide an all-year-round service. Its facilities include two operating theatres, a pathology lab, and an intensive care unit. A campaign is currently planned to build a larger complex on a new site that will allow the expansion of the organisation's educational programmes; the planned expansion would increase the facility's footprint to , rely heavily on eco-friendly technology, and be carbon-neutral.
As of 11 November 2011, "Wildlife Aid" was reincorporated at the Charity Commission as the "Wildlife Aid Foundation"
Wildlife SOS.
In 1996, following a fire that destroyed one third of the hospital complex, Cowell found his organisation reliant on media attention for its continued survival. Cowell was approached by representatives of the newly formed Animal Planet channel to produce a television series chronicling the drama of life in the wildlife rescue facility. The show experienced long-term success; it has been cited as "the longest-running animal rescue TV series".

Aldgate Pump

Aldgate Pump is a historic water pump in the City of London, located at a junction where Aldgate meets Fenchurch Street and Leadenhall Street. The pump marks the start of the A11 road towards Norwich and is a Grade II listed structure. As a well, it was mentioned during the reign of King John. As the City developed, it is thought to have been taken down and re-erected at its current location in 1876, as a drinking fountain, as streets were widened.
Served by one of London's many underground streams, people began to complain about the "funny" taste of the water. Upon investigation, this was found to be caused by the leaching of calcium from the bones of the dead in many new cemeteries in north London through which the stream ran. In 1876, the New River Company changed the supplies to mains water.
The wolf head on the pump is supposed to signify the last wolf shot in the City of London.
Fenchurch Street railway station was built in 1841 upon the site of Aldgate Pump Court.
"Aldgate Pump" was also the name of a song, written by G. W. Hunt for the "lion comique" Arthur Lloyd in 1869. In the song, the raconteur is abandoned by the girl "I met near Aldgate Pump".
There is also a landmark in the township of Aldgate in the Adelaide Hills in South Australia known as the "Aldgate Pump". It is a disused hand pump which was originally located directly outside the Aldgate Pump Hotel. It was relocated to the intersection of Kingsland Road and Mount Barker Road but was removed in 2009 to make way for roadworks and installed on a pedestal on the footpath in the Aldgate Main Street in 2011.

<doc id="20821845" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20821845" title="Autism National Committee">
Autism National Committee

The Autism National Committee (known also as AUTCOM or AutCom) is an American advocacy association of autistic people and their allies. AutCom operates as a non-profit organization. AutCom is the only autism advocacy organization dedicated to "social justice for all citizens with Autism" through a shared vision and a commitment to positive approaches to protect and advance the human and civil rights of all persons with autism, pervasive developmental disorder, and related differences of Communication and behavior.
Autism.
Autism is a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. The signs can all begin before a child is three years old. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize. How this all occurs is still unknown and not well understood. 
Autism is the one of the three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum, the two other being Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and Pervasive Development Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified, which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met. The diagnosis of Asperger's was eliminated in the 2013 fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and replaced by a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder on a severity scale.
In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects, such as environmental causes including heavy metals, pesticides or childhood vaccines. 
The occurrence of autism is about 1-2 per 1,000 people worldwide. 
In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports approximately 9 per 1,000 children are diagnosed with autism. The number of people diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder has increased dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic criteria; the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.
AutCom Activities and History.
AUTCOM was founded in 1990 to protect and advance the human rights and civil rights of all persons with autism, Pervasive Development Disorder, and related differences of communication and behavior. It was founded by the late Dr. Herb Lovett. In the face of social policies of devaluation, which are expressed in the practices of segregation, medicalization, and aversive conditioning, AutCom asserts that all individuals are created equal and endowed with certain inalienable rights, and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. As an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, AutCom works to ensure that people with autism and related disabilities are treated with equality and dignity. 
In 2012, AutCom published " How Safe is the Schoolhouse? An Analysis of State Seclusion and Restraint Policies" written by Jessica Butler. The report provides a summary of state restraint and seclusion laws and policies in effect in 2012 for students in school. Approximately 29 states have meaningful legal protections against seclusion and restraint in school.
Public Policy.
AutCom believes strongly that no person should be subject to restraint, seclusion, aversives, or other forms of abuse. Children in school should receive positive supports and accommodations for their disability needs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that hundreds of children have been subjected to these techniques, including a 7 year old dying after being held face down for hours by staff, and 5 year olds tied to chairs with duct tape and suffering broken arms and bloody noses. According to Unsafe in the Schoolhouse: Abuse of Children with Disabilities (J. Butler COPAA 2009), a large number of students who are abused have autism.
AutCom advocates for the right of autistic people to communicate via whatever form of augmentative and alternative communication they choose, including Facilitated Communication (FC), which is a technique involving one person's providing physical assistance to a communicatively impaired individual with the aim of helping the latter point or type. CNN reported on the experiences of some users of FC at AutCom's 2007 conference. In a position paper published in 2008, AutCom argued that FC should not be dismissed but merits full consideration; that research findings are equivocal; and that FC is a valid means of communication for certain individuals (e.g., those who have gone on to type independently or with minimal physical support).

Aberrant crypt foci

Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) are clusters of abnormal tube-like glands in the lining of the colon and rectum. Aberrant crypt foci form before colorectal polyps and are one of the earliest changes seen in the colon that may lead to cancer. ACF are, as opposed to normal epithelial cells, apoptosis resistant. When looking for aberrant crypt foci with microscopy, methylene blue is used as a staining agent. 
The resulting figure is fairly easy to detect under the microscope at low magnification (x40).
Chemically induced ACF in rodents have been used extensively to test chemicals and diets that might prevent colorectal cancer, and reported in more than 400 scientific articles. The "chemoprevention database" shows the results of all published scientific studies of chemopreventive agents, in people and in animals. 
The relevance of ACF as a surrogate endpoint biomarker for cancer is controversial. Recently, several alternative precancerous lesions have been described (namely MDF, BCAC, and flat ACF), which might be better biomarkers than ACF.
Resveratrol glucoside from transgenic alfalfa has been used for the prevention of aberrant crypt foci in mice.

Oyasato-yakata

The complex includes Tenri University, Tenri Hospital, Tenri Seminary, the Besseki Lecture Hall, the Shuyoka, dormitories, and Tenri High School. Currently 25 wings of the complex are complete. The complete structure calls for 68 wings.
Origins.
In 1934, Nakayama commissioned the famed architect Yoshikazu Uchida to draw up a blueprint for the area. Uchida arranged ten buildings around Oyasama's Residence. A 50-meter boulevard would come out of the Residence on a north-south axis, along which six school buildings would be lined up. Classrooms and large auditoriums would be built at the end of this boulevard. The international school and library were to be eventually integrated into this plan. In January 1937, a middle school (now Tenri High School) was built according to Uchida's plan, but as Japan mobilized for the Pacific War the plan had to be temporarily shelved.
In 1952, after the war and Occupation, Tenrikyo Chief of Architecture Onzō Okumura (奥村音造) was asked by Nakayama to design a large Besseki Lecture Hall to accommodate 10,000 people on the site of an old girls' school. However, considering the location of the school, several hundred meters to the west of the Residence. Okumura thought back to an old prophecy of Oyasama, as recorded in Tenrikyo's "Anecdotes":
Since Tenrikyo was at the time a tiny cult centered around a house in a farming village, the growth of Tenri into a city full of inns paralleling this prophecy was seen as miraculous. In the "Osashizu" these prophecies are repeated, with the admonition that "it will not do to think of small things." The original idea was that the planned school buildings and classrooms would be the first part of an enormous central hub that would eventually fill eight "cho" square. But Okumura began to consider the relationships between the planned buildings and the Residence. If other buildings were placed directly next to the Residence, he reasoned, they would put the Residence in shadow during the sunrise, and metaphorically crowd out the importance of the Jiba itself. Thus, with Nakayama's permission, he developed a new overarching plan for the school, library, and other Tenrikyo buildings surrounding the Residence. His new plan, which arranged the buildings in a great square with open space on the inside, was dubbed the "oyasato-yakata", roughly meaning the "grounds of Oyasama's Residence".
In 1954 the Japanese government merged the six villages surrounding the Residence into a single city, which was dubbed Tenri City. In the same year, the Tenrikyo central church announced the construction of the first wing of the "yakata". The continuing development of the "oyasato-yakata" is currently overseen by a committee with a small office in Tenri Seminary.
Construction.
The "yakata" was designed along the lines of Edo period tenement housing (長屋), but modernized with reinforced walls, multiple stories, and balconies for emergency access. The result is a fusion between Western and Japanese architecture. Gaps were purposefully left in the ground floors for pedestrians, making the "yakata" a walkable space. The balconies and rooftops were also designed to please the eye at the ground level. At the same time, the roofs are visible from Oyasama's gravesite north of the city.
As construction began, Tenrikyo followers founded the Oyasato Construction Young Men's Association "Hinokishin" Corps, which volunteered time and labor to help build the "yakata". The corps still continues their work today. By 1956, one corner of the complex had been built at the cost of 23 billion yen, an enormous expense given the economic depression of the time.
When part of the foundations for the complex were dug in 1977, an archaeological investigation uncovered prehistoric artifacts, as is typical during construction in Tenri. Although it was a sparsely inhabited village in Oyasama's time, Tenri City lies on top of a confirmed cultural center of prehistoric Japan.
Influence on the city.
Information theorist Nomura Masaichi, noting Tenrikyo's description of the oyasato-yakata as a realization of the prophecy of Oyasama and the Tenrikyo saying that "in the construction of form lies the construction of hearts", refers to the ongoing construction as a "medium that combats decontextualization", claiming that it gives renewed relevance to the teachings and introduces a physical context by giving them an active role in shaping the city, and that in time, the thoughts of Tenrikyo believers will come to embody the grand scale of the architecture.
One Tenrikyo elder has written the following on the subject:
Taro Igarashi notes first and foremost its massive accomplishment in city planning. The ground-level architecture can be compared somewhat to Karl Marx-Hof, a massive tenement complex in Vienna, and the pilotis evoke Charles Fourier's phalanstère, an architectural form specifically designed to evoke and construct an egalitarian utopia. However, the use of Japanese roofs in a modern city is quite rare, and the sheer size of the "yakata" makes it perhaps a unique megastructure anywhere in the world. Commenting on Taro's article, the theologian Akio Inoue adds that the final interpretation, for the Tenrikyo believers who funded and built the structure, cannot be to inspire individual faith alone, but to "bridge the Joyous Life of the individual which determines the inner substance of faith and the world of the Joyous Life as an organized community".

VA-210 (U.S. Navy)

Attack Squadron 210 (VA-210) was an aviation unit of the United States Naval Reserve active between 1970 and 1971. VA-210 aircraft wore CVWR-20's tail code "AF", the squadron's nickname was "Black Hawks".
History.
The United States Navy reorganized its Naval Air Reserve units in 1970. To bolster their strength two Reserve Carrier Air Wings (CVWR) were formed, CVWR-20 on the U.S. East Coast and CVWR-30 on the U.S. West Coast.
Utilizing assets from reserve squadron VA-2Z1 attack squadron VA-210 was established at the NAS South Weymouth, Massachusetts (USA) on 1 July 1970. The unit was commanded by Commander W.M. Hollister and equipped with Douglas A-4C Skyhawk attack planes.
However, CVWR-20 had originally only attack squadrons. The decision was made to replace two of the attack squadrons by fighter squadrons in 1971. VA-210 was one of the squadrons to be replaced by fighter squadrons VF-201 and VF-202. Aircraft of VA-201 made their last operational flight on 14 December 1970, the squadron being disestablished on 30 June 1971.

Russ Huesman

Russell Frederick "Russ" Huesman (born January 28, 1960 in Cincinnati, Ohio) is the current head football coach of the Chattanooga Mocs located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He took over as the 22nd head coach of the Mocs on December 22, 2008. The Mocs compete in the Football Championship Subdivision in Division I as members of the Southern Conference.
Playing career.
A native of Cincinnati, Ohio, Huesman played prep football at perennial power Moeller High School, where he lettered for four years under head coach Gerry Faust. He helped Moeller’s team compile a record of 43–0–1 and win a pair of Ohio state championships. 
An all-city selection in football as a senior, Huesman signed a football scholarship with Chattanooga, where he started all four years as a defensive back (1978–81) and was a two-sport athlete. He played under the late Joe Morrison for two years and competed his final two seasons under Bill Oliver. Huesman also patrolled center field on the baseball field for the Mocs during his freshman and junior seasons. 
During his playing career at UTC, the Mocs posted a 31–11–2 mark and were Southern Conference Co-Champions in his freshman and sophomore seasons. 
Huesman was on the Mocs sidelines for the 1982 seasons as a student coach, earning his degree in business education in 1983. He followed that up with a move to the University of South Carolina as a graduate assistant under Morrison.
Coaching career.
Russ Huesman was named the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga football program's 22nd head coach on Dec. 22, 2008. Huesman, a 1983 graduate of UTC and a former defensive back for Chattanooga, brought over 25 years of coaching experience to the Mocs football program.
Huesman spent the previous five seasons as the defensive coordinator at the University of Richmond, helping guide the Spiders to the 2008 Football Championship Subdivision National Title. The Spiders were known for their "Stonewall Defense," a phrase that was coined by Bruce Dowd of the College Sporting News. Richmond’s defense was ranked in the top-15 in the nation in each of the last three seasons under Huesman’s guidance. 
Huesman’s ‘Stonewall Defense’ was most impressive in the 2008 national title game played in Chattanooga. His Spiders held the No. 4 Montana Grizzlies scoreless for three quarters, and just seven points total, in a 24–7 win. 
In 2008, Richmond’s defense ranked in the top-10 in the FCS and was No. 1 in the Colonial Athletic Association in total defense (268.8 yards/game) and scoring defense (15.6 ppg). The Spiders also held 12 different opponents to fewer than 100 yards rushing and less than 20 points. Richmond’s 29 interceptions in 2008 beat the school’s previous single-season record of 20 set back in 1973. 
In 2007, the Spiders ranked second in the CAA and 15th nationally in sacks per game (2.6), while ranking third in the league and 31st in the NCAA in turnover margin per game (+0.6) in 2007. 
In 2006, Huesman led an experienced group that allowed just 268.7 yards per game to rank 11th in the nation and second in the conference. Against the pass, the Spiders were the Atlantic-10’s most dominant team, yielding an average of 152.8 yards and intercepting a league-best 12 passes. Richmond’s front seven ranked fourth in the conference and 21st in the nation against the run, limiting the opposition to just over 115 yards per game on the ground. The Richmond defense allowed the fourth-fewest points in the conference and 22nd fewest in the country (18.1). 
Huesman spent six years at the University of Memphis (1998–2003) where he held several positions, serving as the recruiting coordinator and offensive line coach, before leaving for Richmond. He also coached the outside linebackers, tight ends and running backs. As recruiting coordinator, Huesman brought in a top-50 recruiting class, ranked No. 1 in Conference USA, in 2002. It was the first recruiting class ranked in the top-50 at Memphis in school history. 
Huesman also coached for 14 years at William & Mary and was the Tribe's defensive coordinator for the 1996–97 seasons. During his tenure with the Tribe, Huesman coached current NFL star Darren Sharper, who led a defense ranked second in the nation, allowing just 231.8 yards per game in 1996. That defensive squad also led the Yankee Conference in total defense and helped power the Indians (now Tribe) to their first conference title since 1970. In 1997, the Tribe defense was third overall in the Atlantic 10 and led the league in pass efficiency defense. 
In addition to coordinating the Tribe's defense, Huesman, also coached the William & Mary secondary, a job he took over in 1991. In eight seasons under his direction, the College of William & Mary developed one of the most effective backfields in the nation. 
During his time at William & Mary, Huesman also coached Steve Christie, a 15-year NFL place kicker with Tampa Bay, Buffalo, San Diego and the New York Giants. His coaching family tree also includes Alan Williams, the defensive backs coach for the Indianapolis Colts, and Sean McDermott, the secondary coach with the Philadelphia Eagles. Both Williams and McDermott played for Huesman at William & Mary.

Death to Anders

Death to Anders ("pronounced "onders"") are an American indie rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 2006. Their lineup consists of Rob Danson (vocals and guitar), Rob Hume (bass and background vocals), and Robert Smith (drums).
Death to Anders are active in the influential Echo Park and Silver Lake music scenes in Los Angeles and were founding members of the Central Second Collective, a group of up-and-coming rock musicians dedicated to promoting innovative, new music in Los Angeles. 
Often compared to Pavement, early Modest Mouse and Sonic Youth but defying hard classification, Death to Anders shift dramatically between hypnotic melodies and raging dissonance as they mix intelligent, story-driven rock with quirky Gothic Americana.
Formation and history: 2004-present.
Death to Anders was first formed as a duo in 2004, under the name of the "Thick Liquid Sucker Punch", by Danson and original guitarist Nick Ceglio while the two were students at the Musician's Institute in Hollywood, California. While most of their classmates were interested in heavy metal or progressive rock, the two bonded over their shared enthusiasm for Sonic Youth, the Pixies, and Pavement. 
Death to Anders joined with several other young Los Angeles bands, including the Happy Hollows, the Transmissions, One Trick Pony, the Henry Clay People, Anchors for Architects, and DiE RoCKERS DiE, to form the Central Second Collective, a group dedicated to promoting innovative, independent music. The collective's name refers to the Cocaine, an indie club within 2nd Street Jazz, a venue located at Central and 2nd Avenues in the "Little Tokyo" district of downtown Los Angeles. Although the Central Second Collective no longer formally exists, member bands continue to play and record together, appearing regularly in the independent and underground clubs of the Silverlake and Echo Park music scenes, the birthplace of successful indie bands like Beck, Elliott Smith, Rilo Kiley, Sea Wolf, and Silversun Pickups. Several of the Second Central Collective bands, including Death to Anders, will also be featured in the book "Gooseberries", a collection of portraits by Los Angeles music photojournalist Sterling Andrews that will be released through Eenie Meenie Records in the Spring of 2009.
Death to Anders self-produced their first album "Punctuate the Calamities" in the Fall of 2006, and after recording with British producer David Newton (formerly of the Mighty Lemon Drops) at Rollercoaster Recording in 2007, they released two albums in 2008, a full-length entitled "Fictitious Business" and an EP entitled "Enigmatic Market". In 2010, Danson re-formed Death to Anders as a dynamic 3-piece featuring bassist Rob Hume and drummer Robert Smith. 
In 2011, armed with new material, the trio released the E.P. "Don't Give Up," which was recorded at Infrasonic Sound (No Age, Wavves, Fools Gold) and mixed by Ali Nikou at BlasterMaster Productions
in Los Angeles. Death to Anders released their E.P. on October 25, 2011 during L.A blog Buzz Bands’ three-year anniversary show at The Echo in Echo Park, California, where they shared the bill with Everest and Hands.
Musical style and influences.
Rob Hume's highly melodic bass work, inspired by Bruce Thomas of the Attractions, is effortlessly integrated with Smith's energetic, Keith Moon (The Who) and Jimmy Chamberlin (Smashing Pumpkins) inspired drums. Danson's lead vocals, which range from the quietly sincere to squealing intensity betray the influence of Stephen Malkmus, Nick Cave and Isaac Brock, 
Death to Anders are also known for their intelligent, darkly humorous and often mysterious lyrics, which are written by Danson and Ceglio and inspired by the literary works of Henry Miller, Albert Camus, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Tom Robbins, and Chuck Palahniuk. The title of the band's debut album, "Punctuate the Calamities", is even a reference to Miller's "Tropic of Cancer".

Moumen Smihi

Moumen Smihi is a filmmaker who was born in 1945 in Tangier, Morocco. His career spans more than four decades, during which he has written, produced and directed award-winning and influential feature films, short films and documentaries. He is considered to be a seminal member of the "new Arab cinema", which began to flourish in the 1970s. Its proponents, inspired by political and artistic concerns, and similar to Italy's New Realism, France's Nouvelle Vague, and the US independent and underground movements, worked outside of the studio systems of Hollywood and Egypt, where business incentives dictated form and content.
Smihi has taught and lectured at Paris 8 University and at UCLA's Center for Near Eastern Studies. He has traveled extensively in Greece, France, Italy and in the Middle East, and has lived and worked in Egypt. Today, he divides his time between Tangier and Paris. His production company, IMAGO Film International, founded in 1979, has produced some twenty films and edited books on film theory.
Early life.
As World War II was drawing to a close, Smihi was born into a religious Muslim family living in the cosmopolis of Tangier. The city, which from 1923 had the status of an "International zone" governed by France, Spain and Great Britain (with the addition of Italy in 1926), was about to undergo a process of restoration to full sovereignty that, after a period of Spanish control from 1940 to 1945 during World War II, culminated in 1956 with the signing of the Tangier Protocol.
Although the men of Smihi's family had for generations been fquihs (Muslim ministers), Smihi's father insisted that his son attend a French secular school that was conducted in both French and Arabic.
The Tangier of Smihi's childhood was home to some prominent Beat Generation writers and expats. Paul Bowles, William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg lived there and could often be found drinking mint tea and smoking kif (Moroccan marijuana) in the Zocco Chico square. They nurtured local artists such as Mohamed Choukri and Mohamed Mrabet, whose "Big Mirror" was later adapted by Smihi, with a screenplay by Paul Bowles, Gavin Lambert and Smihi. Egyptian, American and Spanish films were widely shown at the time and Smihi was a fervent moviegoer.
At the same time, Smihi was becoming profoundly influenced by Marxist theory. His friendship and discussions with prominent Moroccan Marxists lead him to a deeply felt and abiding desire to articulate cultural concerns and their political expression in his films. In 1964, he took part in the political student uprising in Rabat that was ferociously repressed by the Moroccan police and army.
Career.
In 1965, Smihi was awarded a scholarship by the French government and left Morocco for Paris to study filmmaking at IDHEC (Institut des Hautes Etudes Cinématographiques).
He was influenced by the seminars of Jacques Lacan, Michel Foucault and Claude Lévy-Strauss at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, and particularly by Roland Barthes, with whom he worked on a memoir.
Smihi has cited the cinéma vérité pioneer Jean Rouch and Henri Langlois of the Cinémathèque Française, whom he met at the Francophone Film Festival, as being among those who imparted to him a sense of the magic of movies.
Paris was undergoing its own "revolution" in 1968 which further fueled Smihi's imaginings of an Arab "patria grande". A constant in his work is an emphasis on the interrelationships between his fictional characters, the Arab culture and its history — which Smihi views critically as permeated with decadence and colonial influence.
His first short film, "Si Moh Pas de Chance" ("The Unlucky Man") portrayed the miserable conditions of North African immigrant workers in Europe. It was shot in France and won the Grand Prize at the Festival International d'Expression Française in Dinard (1971). This film, along with "Wechma" by his friend Hamid Benani, was presented at the Swiss Film Archive by Freddy Buache, who praised them as heralding "the birth of Moroccan cinema."
It was in Morocco in 1975 that Smihi produced and directed his prize-winning first feature "El Chergui" ("The East Wind"), which was highly regarded in Europe and Africa and received enthusiastic reviews in Le Nouvel Observateur, Jeune Afrique, The International Herald Tribune2 and elsewhere. Also titled "The Violent Silence", the film uses the story of a woman threatened by her polygamist husband to speak of a repressed and silenced Morocco.
His second feature, "The Tales of the Night", won the Venezia Genti Prize at the Mostra of Venezia in 1985.3 Here, Smihi's filmmaking language is manifest: weaving together while teasing apart the threads of realism, poetry and the principles of "text theory"; a refusal of the structures of "ideological discourse", thus allowing the strength and the independence of the esthetic material to emerge.4
In the 1980s, Smihi began to seek French and international co-productions resulting in French television companies producing a number of his films. During this period, he traveled widely in Greece, France, Italy and the Middle East presenting his films at festivals. He also became interested in psychoanalytic theory which began to influence his work.
In 1987, he made "The Big Mirror", which portrayed both the rise of the middle class in Morocco and the delirium generated by King Hassan's censorship, under which filmmakers were obliged to use a language replete with oblique references and hidden meanings.5
In 1988 Smihi moved to Cairo where, through the director Salah Abu Seif, he met Naguib Mahfouz, with whom he planned an adaptation of Mahfouz's novel "Autumn Quail". During this period, Smihi directed two films in three years, "Defending the Egyptian Cinema" and "The Lady from Cairo", the latter, the story of a woman who wants to be free and modern in an Egypt overwhelmed by terrorism.
For the past ten years Smihi has been working on an autobiography from which he adapted the screenplays of his last two features, "A Muslim Childhood" in 2005 (nominated at the Fifth Marrakech International Film Festival) and "Of Virgins And Swallows" (2008) both about his native Tangier.
