Nijō poetic school

The refers to descendants of Fujiwara no Tameie's eldest son, Nijō Tameuji (1222–86). The family name took after Nijō district of Kyoto where the family had resided. This hereditary house of Japanese waka poetry is generally known for its conservative slant toward the politics and poetics aimed at preserving the ideals of Fujiwara no Shunzei and Fujiwara no Teika. The members of the family are credited for the compilation of eleven out of thirteen later imperial anthologies, i.e., :
The rivals of Nijō school, the Kyōgoku and Reizei families are known for their innovative approach to poetic composition. The Kyōgoku family compiled the following two imperial anthologies:

List of National Natural Landmarks in West Virginia

This is a list of the National Natural Landmarks (NNLs) in West Virginia. There are 15 in all — 5 are wetlands (bogs, swamps, etc.), 3 are forests, 6 are limestone caves/karst, and one is a rock formation. (In addition, the Cranesville Swamp Preserve is a NNL mostly in Garrett County, Maryland, a portion of which extends into Preston County, West Virginia.) Ten of the 15 NNLs are within the boundaries of the Monongahela National Forest, although this does not necessarily mean they are on public land.
De-designation.
According to a notice in the "Federal Register" ( Vol. 71, No. 138 / Wednesday, July 19, 2006), Swago Karst Area (in Pocahontas County) was removed by the Department of the Interior from NNL designation in response to owner requests.

Susannah Sheldon

Susannah Sheldon, a refugee from Maine, was eighteen years of age during the time of the witchcraft crisis at Salem Village. As one of the core group of allegedly afflicted girls, Sheldon made claims of afflictions for the first time during the last week of April 1692. Four days following the accusation that Minister George Burroughs was the leader of the suspected witches, Sheldon allegedly began experiencing “strange spectral encounters"
Symptoms.
Throughout the trial, Sheldon allegedly experienced apparitions from specters attempting to persuade her to sign the devil’s book, visions from the dead, visual manifestations from familiars of snakes and yellow birds on her tormentors, and symptoms of feeling physically choked and having her hands bound so tight that she could not free herself. In an attempt to diagnose the symptoms claimed to have been experienced by the girls, scholars have attributed the torments to a variety of causes, giving such explanations of fraud, ergot poisoning, hysteria, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). One such scholar, Mary Beth Norton, argues that Sheldon experienced PTSD because of her connection to the Indian wars on the Maine frontier. Sheldon was a young child during the confrontation at Black Point garrison in 1675, and Norton speculates Sheldon would have developed PTSD from living through the Indian conflict, the death agonies of her uncle Arthur, the grief of her mother and aunt, and the death of her older brother Godfrey in July 1690.

Atomic recoil

Atomic recoil is the result of the interaction of an atom with an energetic elementary particle, when the momentum of the interacting particle is transferred to the atom as whole without altering non-translational degrees of freedom of the atom. It is a purely quantum phenomenon.
If the transferred momentum of atomic recoil is enough to disrupt the crystal lattice of the material, a vacancy defect is formed otherwise a phonon is generated.
Closely related to the atomic recoil is the electron recoil, (see photoexcitation and photoionization).
Another form is the nuclear recoil, when momentum transfers to the atomic nucleus as whole.
In some cases quantum effects can forbid momentum transfer to an individual nucleus, and momentum is transferred to the crystal lattice as a whole. (see Mössbauer effect)

National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor

A National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor (NIETC) corridor is a geographic region designated by the United States Department of Energy where electricity transmission limitations are adversely affecting American citizens. In 2005 the United States Congress granted the Department of Energy the authority to create these regions in an effort to speed the creation of more transmission capacity. Should state and local governments fail to issue permits allowing construction of new transmission, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the authority to issue a federal permit empowering a project director to exercise the right of eminent domain to purchase property needed to complete the project.
Background.
In the United States, electricity generation is growing 4 times faster than transmission, and energy sources that would make the U.S. more energy independent cannot be built because there is no transmission capacity to carry the power to consumers. Because United States energy independence is a national priority, this problem has attracted considerable federal attention.
Historically, local governments have exercised authority over the electricity grid and have little incentive to take action that would benefit other states, but not their own. States with cheap electricity have a disincentive to make interstate commerce in electricity easier, since other states will be able to compete for local energy and drive up rates. Further, vocal local constituencies can block or slow permitting by pointing to visual impact, environmental, and perceived health concerns.
Large transmission upgrades require coordination of multiple states, a multitude of interlocking permits, and a significant portion of the 500 companies that own the grid. From a policy perspective, the control of the grid is balkanized, and the former Energy secretary Bill Richardson refers to it as a "third world grid". To address to the U.S. national security interest in significantly growing transmission capacity, the 2005 energy act gave the Department of Energy the authority to approve transmission if states refuse to act. However, soon after using its power to designate two national corridors, 14 senators signed a letter stating the DOE was being too aggressive
Corridor designations of 2007.
In 2007, the DOE designated two corridors, the Mid-Atlantic Area national corridor, and the Southwest Area corridor. Using a source-and-sink approach, the DOE determined areas of significant transmission network congestion and electricity demand (sink), then examined likely areas of nearby generation (source). The possible paths between these sources and sinks defined the highest priority regions where transmission lines need to be built. In designating an NIETC corridor, the DOE does not specify preferred routes for projects, just the general region where such projects are eligible for federal permits. Further, DOE did not exclude federal or state lands from the regions since right of eminent domain by a FERC permit would not apply to them. Although Congress did not specify that national corridors expire, the Secretary of Energy set a limit of 12 years for the Southwest and Mid-Atlantic corridors, subject to revision at any time after giving notice and opportunity for public comment.
Project Approval.
Approval of routes for specific projects will continue to be the responsibility of state authorities. However, FERC may issue a permit if a proposed project will significantly reduce a transmission constraint in the national corridor. According to the DOE, NIETC permit process should not disrupt existing activities of state authorities, and will investigate allegations that an applicant has acted in bad faith in state proceedings.
When a specific route is chosen for a project, FERC will conduct an environmental impact statement (EIS) prior to groundbreaking. The DOE did not conduct an EIS for either NIETC region, arguing that the designation does not authorize any specific projects or routes.

Ex juvantibus

The term ex juvantibus (from Latin, meaning "from that which helps") refers, in medical contexts, to the process of making an inference about disease causation from an observed response of the disease to a treatment. 
For example, taking the case of a patient whose headache had been alleviated by taking aspirin, an "ex juvantibus" line of reasoning would state that the headaches were caused by low levels of aspirin in the brain. Obviously, the fact that aspirin cures headaches does not prove that headaches are caused by the absence of aspirin. In "The 21st-Century Brain" (2006), Steven Rose applies the term to the use of psychoactive drugs to "cure" depression, implying that the underlying cause of depression is not simply low levels of certain chemicals in the brain (such as serotonin) that these drugs treat.
The phrase does not necessarily connote a fallacy. For example, a patient presents with retrosternal pain which is not relieved by sublingual nitrates (a standard remedy for angina pectoris) but is relieved with antacids (a standard remedy for heartburn). In such a case, a physician may hypothesize "ex juvantibus" what the underlying problem may or may not be, until a definitive diagnosis is established.

Panamaram

Panamaramis a village in Wayanad district in the state of Kerala, India.
The proposed 100-hectare site for new feeder airport in the Wayanad district is at Cheekkalloor() in Panamaram and the nearby Nadavayal.
Panamaram River.
Panamaram River is a tributary of the Kabani River along with Mananthavady, Babali, Noolpuzha and Nugu Rivers. Kabani and its tributaries play a key role in the enhancement of the landscapes of Wayanad District.
About 6 km north of Panamaram, the Kabini takes birth. It is the confluence of the Panamaram river, originating in the Western ghats near Pookode Lake, a perennial lake near Lakkidi, 4,500 ft above sea level, and the Mananthavady river, springing from the 5,000 ft Tondarmudi. The Kabini is, perhaps, the most feminine of Kerala rivers. The flow of life on its banks is incredibly peaceful and dream-like. The confluence of these rivers is Kabani River and it after entering the state of Karnataka merges with the Kaveri River.
Panamaram Fort.
Panamaram has great significance in the history of Indian freedom struggle as it witnessed one of the first freedom struggle in South India.
On October 11, 1802 Pazhassi Raja's followers like Thalakkal Chanthu and Edachena Kunkan Nair captured the Panamaram Fort which was manned by the infantry units of Bombay. Commanding officer Capt. Dickinson and Lt. Maxwell were killed in action along with 25 soldiers. And this victory brought a new vigor to the resistance movement.
Panamaram Heronry.
According to the annual heronry count of the Malabar Natural History Society (MNHS), the Panamaram Heronry is the largest heronry in Malabar in terms of number and diversity of birds breeding there. It is a small (1 acre) island in the river Kabani, an elevated sand bank. Government has issued orders to take apt measures to conserve the Panamaram Heronry. The massive destruction of bamboo groves on the Heronry and unbridled sand mining are the two vital issues the heronry is facing. It has been observed that, many birds of the foreign origin also migrate to Panamaram during the nestling season. The Cattle Egret(Bubulcus Ibis) is also observed in breeding here in 2010, the breeding of the bird is reported in the state after 62 years. Other main species are Little Egret, Ardeola(Pond Heron), Night Heron, Intermediate Egret, Purple Heron, and Black-headed Ibis.

Digital Summer

Digital Summer is an American hard rock band from Phoenix, Arizona, formed in 2006.
The band released an EP and 4 full-length albums, the most recent of which, titled "", was released on October 8, 2013.
History.
Formation, "Cause and Effect" and "Hollow" (2006-2009).
Digital Summer was formed in 2006 when brothers Kyle Winterstein (vocals/song writing) and Ian Winterstein (guitar) enlisted long time friend Anthony "Guido" Hernandez (bass/backing vocals) to form the core of the band. After a few months, Digital Summer made the addition of Johnmark "Fish" Cenfield on lead guitar. The band has had a couple different full-time drummers, most recently Ben Anderson who left in late 2012.
The band's first full length release, "Cause and Effect", was released on March 8, 2007. “Whatever It Takes,” was the first single and it spent 45 weeks in rotation on Sirus/XM's Octane 20, and got adds from KUPD, WWBN, WFXH, WPBZ, KXTE, KATT, KILO, KXXR, WZBH, WIIL, Cage Rattle Radio, and more. In addition, "Whatever it Takes" was featured as one of the "Top 4 Songs of the Day" for over six weeks straight on 98KUPD. The second single “Disconnect,” also enjoyed similar success with over 40 national adds, Sirus/XM's Octane 20, WRIF, KSHE, and KUPD included.
An acoustic version of "Whatever it Takes" was featured in KUPD's Acoustic Scorcher album released at Phoenix area Best Buy locations. The sold-out disc included 10 tracks recorded on-site at KUPD's End of Summer Scorcher by artists such as Sevendust, Corey Taylor of Slipknot, Five Finger Death Punch, Tantric, Cavo, and Digital Summer.
Following "Cause and Effect", the band released the 2 disc EP/DVD set, "Hollow", on March 31, 2008. The DVD portion of the set included a music video for the song "Rescue Me". The full video production included a scene of a car accident and featured both friends and co-workers of the band.

The second single, "Hostage", was also released nationally to radio.
"Breaking Point" (2011-2013).

<doc id="20689999" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20689999" title="Terhuchu">
Terhuchu

Terhuchu is a two-player abstract strategy board game from India, and specifically from Assam and Angami. Another spelling for the game is Terhiichii. The game is similar to draughts and Alquerque as players hop over one another's pieces to capture them. However, unlike draughts and standard Alquerque, the game is played on an expanded Alquerque board consisting of eight triangular boards attached to the four sides and the four corners of an Alquerque board. Also, pieces can move and capture in any direction from the beginning. There is no promotion to King. 
Terhuchu is related to Sixteen Soldiers, Peralikatuma, and Kotu Ellima which are also from the Indian subcontinent. The main difference is that in Terhuchu there are eight triangular boards attached to the Alquerque board, whereas in those other games, there are only four. Kotu Ellima is also related to the Indonesian game of Permainan-Tabal.
Goal.
The player who captures all the other player's pieces wins. 
Equipment.
An expanded Alquerque board is used. Four triangle boards are attached to the center of the four sides and four corners of an Alquerqe board. It is unknown exactly how many pieces each player has. One player has the white pieces, and the other has the black pieces, however, any two colors or distinguishable objects will do. Pieces are played on the intersection points of the board.
Game play and rules.
1. Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first. Players alternate their turns, and only use one piece to either move or capture per turn.
2. Each player's pieces are initially set up on their half of the board.
3. A piece moves one space per turn in any direction following the pattern on the board onto an unoccupied point on the board.
4. A piece can capture an enemy piece in any direction by the short leap as in draughts or Alquerque. The player's piece must be adjacent to the enemy piece, and leap over it onto a vacant point on the other side. The leap must be in a straight line following the pattern on the board. The same piece can continue to capture and even change direction to capture provided capturing requirements are satisfied. Captures are compulsory. A piece must continue to capture if it is able to do so. Captured pieces are removed from the board. 
5. If a player has more than one option to capture, then the player can choose any one (and only one) of them.

CAdES ("CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures") is a set of extensions to Cryptographic Message Syntax(CMS) signed data making it suitable for advanced electronic signature.
Description.
While CMS is a general framework for digitally signing documents such as E-Mail(S/MIME) or PDF, CAdES specifies precise profiles of CMS signed data for use with advanced electronic signature in the meaning of European Union Directive 1999/93/EC.
One important benefit of CAdES is that electronically signed documents can remain valid for long periods, even if underlying cryptographic algorithms are broken.
The main document describing the format is ETSI TS 101 733 Electronic Signature and Infrastructure (ESI) – CMS Advanced Electronic Signature (CAdES).
The first issue of this TS is V1.2.2 (2000-12), the latest is V1.8.3 (2011-01).
This ETSI TS V.1.7.4 (2008-07) is technically equivalent to RFC 5126.
RFC 5126 document builds on existing standards that are widely adopted. These includes

The Ugly Americans in Australia

The Ugly Americans in Australia is a live album by the Los Angeles New Wave band Wall of Voodoo, mostly recorded at The Palace in Melbourne during the group's Australian tour in August 1987.
Bassist Bruce Moreland had departed the group again by this stage, and in order for Charles Gray to play bass in addition to his normal keyboard duties, the group took on guest keyboardist Roger Mason from popular Australian band The Models.
Two of the album's tracks, "Living in the Red" and "The Heart Never Can Tell", were recorded at Big Joe's Bar 'n' Grill in Bullhead City, Arizona. The CD issue included another two tracks from Bullhead, "The Grass is Greener" and an idiosyncratic cover of Woody Guthrie's "Pretty Boy Floyd."
It was dedicated to renowned German producer Conny Plank, who had died in December 1987, and who never recorded with Wall of Voodoo, but whose productions for such German progressive/experimental bands as Kraftwerk, Neu!, Cluster, Harmonia and Guru Guru were an influence on the group's music.
The album title makes reference to the bestselling 1958 expose "The Ugly American" by Eugene Burdick and William J. Lederer.
The front cover painting was by iconic artist Robert Williams, featuring one vicious clown beating another with his fists while female conjoined twins in skimpy attire look on with astonished looks. The full title of Williams' painting is "An Allegory of Contradictions Revealing Serendipity Purveyors of Mirth Presenting a Tableau of Blood and Grease Paint in a Circusian Clash to the Death", while the colloquial title is "Duelling Bimbos."
This album completed the band's contract with IRS Records, and they disbanded for good by mid-1988.

Johann Rudolf de Steiger

Baron Johann Rudolf de Steiger (or de Steiguer) (1778- † 1834) was a Swiss nobleman who immigrated to the United States in the 19th century.
Early life.
Johann was born into a Bernese noble family of the Ancien Régime of Switzerland. He was the son of Baron Johann Rudolf de Steiger and Elizabeth von Tavel, and born in Karlruhe, Germany in 1778. His father was a Lt. Colonel, and bailiff of Grandson, Switzerland, who resided for some time at Grandson Castle. Johann himself would be a captain of the guards for Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden, as well as a business owner.
French invasion.
In 1798, the French under Napoleon would invade Switzerland. The Swiss aristocracy was indecisive in dealing with this threat, but Johann's cousin, Niklaus Friedrich von Steiger was not. He was the most prominent political figure in Switzerland at the time, and leader of the political party and Bernese senate which supported the resistance against Napoleon and the French. Niklaus would participate in the battle of Grauholz in 1798 in an attempt to push back the French invasion. 
The Swiss aristocracy would be overthrown by Napoleon, however, and much of the de Steiger fortune usurped to pay for Napoleon's expeditions into Egypt. In 1803, the Austrians and Russians would invade Switzerland, which led to the Act of Mediation.
Marriages.
Johann would marry a German woman named Wilhelmina Muller, in which they would have three children, John, Elizabeth, and Wilhelmina. The couple would divorce. Johann, who would own a flour mill, fell in love with an employee's daughter, Magdalena Stalder. However, Bernese law prevented the intermarriage of Swiss nobility and lower classes. He would leave Bern, Switzerland to immigrate to the United States with dreams of creating a Swiss colony, and to marry Magdalena.
Immigration to America.
In 1819, Johann sold his family's possessions, including his business, gathered his children, Magdalena, and some Swiss colonists, and began a journey to America. They traveled to Amsterdam, where he married Magdalena, to board a ship for America. They arrived in America, journeyed to Philadelphia, then to Pittsburgh, and boarded a boat down the Ohio river.
They would disembark in southern Ohio, where Johann then purchased along the Federal creek in Athens, Ohio, for his family and fellow colonists. Ohio by this time was already a state of the United States, and the dreams of a Swiss colony were not realistic. The colonists were an urban group, and had troubles in the American frontier, but nonetheless survived. Johann would build a cabin initially for his family, and eventually a Swiss-style cottage, which still stands as an historical landmark in Athens. 
He would die in 1834, and is buried in Wood County, West Virginia. A descendant of Johann's was Louis R. de Steiguer, who was the grandson of John.

Union Theatre, London

The Union Theatre is a small fringe theatre situated in the borough of Southwark in London, England. It was established in 1998 by Sasha Regan who took the initiative to convert a disused paper warehouse on Union Street near Southwark station into a functioning theatre. Set beneath railway arches, it is one of the more distinctive theatrical spaces in London.
The theatre is currently threatened with closure as its landlord, the publicly owned infrastructure body Network Rail, wishes to redevelop the site for offices. A campaign has been started to save the theatre, and also other small businesses nearby which have been given just 12 weeks notice to relocate 
The Union has a reputation for staging high-quality musicals in its tiny studio space. Some of its acclaimed productions include Stephen Sondheim's "Sweeney Todd", Adler and Ross' "The Pajama Game", Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" (an all-male version) and "HMS Pinafore". The Union won the accolade of Best Up-and-Coming Theatre in the 2008 Empty Space Peter Brook Awards. The Union hosted the London premier of a new musical, "Once Upon A Time At The Adelphi", in March 2010. 
The theatre has an all-day cafe and a bar.

SS Empire Adur

SS "Empire Adur was a 1,479 ton steamship which was built in 1920 as the Griffdu. She was renamed Noyo in 1935 and in 1940 was sold to Thailand, being renamed Nang Suang Nawa", being seized in 1942 and renamed "Empire Adur". She was sold to Thailand in 1948, reverting to "Nang Suang Nawa" and was lost at sea in 1955 while being towed to Hong Kong for scrapping.
History.
"Griffdu" was built by J F Duthie & Co, Seattle, Washington. She was the 37th and last ship built by Duthie. "Griffdu" was launched on 20 September 1920, and completed the following month. Her original owner was the Universal Steamship & Barge Co, Seattle. In 1925, "Griffdu" was sold to The Charles Nelson Co, San Francisco, serving with them for ten years. In 1935, "Griffdu" was sold to the Union Lumber Co, San Francisco, who renamed her "Noyo". She served for five years before being sold to the Thai Niyom Panich Co, ("Thai Navigation Co Ltd") Bangkok, who reflagged her and renamed her "Nang Suang Nawa". In 1942, "Nang Suang Nawa" was seized, and passed to the Ministry of War Transport and renamed "Empire Adur". She was placed under the management of the Singapore Straits Steamship Company.
"Empire Adur" was not a popular member of convoys due to the condition of her boilers, and the fact that she would belch black smoke and flames from her funnel. The convoy escorts threatened to ask "Empire Adur" to leave the convoy or sink her. Another of her faults was that the nut holding the steering wheel on often came loose, with the result that the wheel came off in the helmsman's hands.
"Empire Adur" joined Convoy KMS 21 at Gibraltar on 29 July 1943, arriving at Port Said on 9 August. "Empire Adur" had a final destination of Tripoli and Alexandria.
In 1948, "Empire Adur" was sold to the Thai Maritime Navigation Co, Bangkok and regained her former name of "Nang Suang Nawa". She served for a further seven years but went missing under tow by the Philippines registered tug "Albacore" to Hong Kong for scrapping. Both vessels were presumed lost. Her last reported position was north of the Paracel Islands at on 23 November 1955.

Clan Ged

Clan Ged is a Scottish clan. The clan does not currently have a chief recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms and is considered an armigerous clan. Without a recognised chief the clan has no standing under Scots Law. In Scotland, the surname "Ged" and "Geddes" may be derived from the place-name Geddes in Nairn. Another possibility is that it is derived from the Old English "gedda", a nickname meaning pike. The coats of arms of "Ged" and "Geddes" contain three pike, referring to their surnames. The English word for pike is "luce", and several Norman families named "de Lucy" have pike on their coats of arms. One unsupported possibility is that one such family moved to Scotland and adopted the surnames "Ged" or "Geddes". An early record of the clan name is found in the Privy Council, which records the respite granted to James Tweedie after the murder of William Geddes in 1558.
The crest badge suitable for members of Clan Ged is derived from the arms of Ged of that Ilk, which is recorded in the Lyon Register. The crest badge contains the crest "a pike's head Proper" and the motto "DURAT DITAT PLACET" (from Latin: "it sustains, it enriches, it pleases"). The crest of a pike is a pun on the clan name. The use of pike on the arms is an example of canting arms, as a "ged" is the heraldic term for a pike.

Picture Atlantic

History.
Formation (2006).
Picture Atlantic was formed in early 2006 in Santa Clara, CA. The band was founded by John Tran and Ryan Blair, ex-members of San Jose Metalcore band Dance Floor Murder, as well as Patrick Chu of San Jose pop punk band October Sky. Unhappy with their musical situations in both bands, the three friends began to write music in Ryan Blair's Santa Clara garage. Seeking the vocal talents of a singer, they recruited longtime friend and musician Nikolaus Bartunek, who was at that time playing solo folk and acoustic music in Bay Area coffee shops. 
There is much speculation as to how Picture Atlantic settled upon their name. In interviews the band has explained that the origin of the band's name was from their love of beach trips made in the summer, and a similar love for the song "Atlantic" by the post-hardcore band Thrice.
"Change is Welcome" (2006).
By late June 2006, the band had written enough material to warrant the recording of their first EP, Change is Welcome. The EP was recorded over the course of a single weekend at Castle Ultimate studios in Oakland, CA. During this period, the band went through numerous guitar players including past October Sky member Andy Tran, Chris Sturm, Kevin Davis, and Nick Dunn. The band also began enlisting the help of live keyboardist Brian Graves.
"Kleos" (2008).
After having spent time on the road playing shows, the band developed enough material to record a full-length album. They headed back to Castle Ultimate to record Kleos. Shortly before starting the first session, Tran left the band to continue school. Without a drummer, the band continued production until Bartunek's friend, Rico Rodriguez, offered his services for the recording in mid-2008. The album was released on June 20, 2008. Hellam joined the band full-time as second guitarist, as well as Graves joining full-time on keyboard.
The album holds elements and themes having to do with Greek mythology, and takes the name Kleos directly from the Iliad. Bartunek has stated in interviews that "...the reason I chose kleos is, I think every musician, nowadays especially, wants to be remembered, and everybody is trying so hard to stamp their face on the music industry and not be forgotten." 
During the initial release of Kleos, Picture Atlantic topped in Absolutepunk.net's Top 100 Bands of 2008.
In July 2008, one month after the release of their album, Picture Atlantic won the chance through the Bay Area radio station Live 105.3
Shortly after, former producer and now guitarist Aaron Hellam parted ways with the band. Hellam remains the bands primary producer.
"Dulce Et Decorum Est" (2010).
On April 21, 2010, the band released a new EP, Dulce Et Decorum Est. This EP was recorded solely by the band at Red Rock Studios in Mountain View, California. Headed by Bartunek and Graves, all engineering was handled by Graves, who had previously been an engineer for seven years at the same studio, and production was head mostly by Bartunek with input by Graves. This EP was originally intended to be a quick easy project, but became a much more expanded and arranged, and stripped down album. Taking its name from the poem Dulce et Decorum est by war poet Wilfred Owen, the album had a heavy influence and some lyrical references to World War I. Although a break away from their more arranged electric sound, the album still received favorable reviews.
"When Everything is Numbers" (2010).
At the end of 2010, Picture Atlantic released another follow up EP entitled "When Everything is Numbers", which was recorded by their friend, past band member and producer Aaron Hellam. This album featured more electric arrangements, and also brought the band into some new musical territory. It was at this time on March 11, 2011, that Picture Atlantic was announced as the winner for Best Local Band as voted by readers of MetroActive Magazine.
Picture Atlantic was also included on Live 105.3's 'Top 20 Bands of The Bay Area' list for 2011, with very favorable reviews.
"The Amalgamash EP" (2011).
On July 17, 2011, the group released The Amalgamash EP, which consisted of five previously unreleased tracks the band had recorded in 2010. Among the songs is the Christmas single, "Parliament of Two" and "I Am Not the King of Anything," which the band recorded during one day off on their West Coast Rumble tour in August 2010.
"Digital Tension" (2012).
On November 8, 2011, drummer Daniel Hernandez Martinez was officially added to the band's line-up via announcements on the group's website.
On December 5, 2011, the band announced via their Twitter account that their next record would be titled "Digital Tension", with a tentative release date for 2012. It has been suggested via the bands Instagram account that Aaron Hellam will again return to produce the record. Mention of "Digital Tension" was also made in a December interview with the music website "101 Distribution".
On March 3, 2012, Digital Tension's recording dates were announced via the band's Tumblr page, with the album to be finished in June.
Album 3 (2014).
Plans to begin recording the third Picture Atlantic album were announced via a post on the band's Tumblr page on September 19, 2013. The album has a tentative release of 2014, with the exact date unspecified. Blair confirmed that the band would continue to work with long-time produce Aaron Hellam for this record. 
Mod Influence.
Although not yet officially confirmed by the band, Picture Atlantic has been known for an aesthetic consistent with Mod fashion, such as Chelsea Boots, Twin striped Ben Sherman and Fred Perry polo shirts, Weller haircuts, fishtail parkas and Ivy League dress. Vocalist Nikolaus Bartunek has also had numerous photo features on the website "The Mod Generation". Their official band Facebook page has a number of Mod related pages in the 'Liked' section.

Neoscopelidae

The Neoscopelidae (blackchins or neoscopelids) are a small family of deep sea fish closely related to the lanternfish. They are found in tropical and subtropical marine waters worldwide.
They can be distinguished from the lanternfish only by a few technical characters, such as the position of the anal fin being far behind that of the dorsal fin. Some, but not all, species also lack the light-emitting organs (photophores) of the lanternfish. They are typically between and in length. One genus has photophores arranged in a single series along the edge of the tongue and one or two along the ventral surface of the body.
Species.
There are just six known species of neoscopelid, grouped into three genera:

Gadubanud

The Gadubanud ("Katabanut") people occupied the rainforest plateau and rugged coastline of Cape Otway in Western Victoria covering the present towns of Lorne and Apollo Bay. The Gellibrand and Barwon Rivers are likely territorial borders with the Wada wurrung to the north east, Gulidjan to the north and Girai Wurrung to the west. Gadubanud means literally the "King Parrot" people. There has been no documented interraction with the Gadubanud since 1846. although some may have found refuge at the Weslayan mission station at Birregurra and later the Framlingham mission station. Today the Gunditjmara people are the traditional custodians of Gadubanud lands, although there are Aboriginal people in the area today who trace their ancestry to the Gudabanud.
Society.
It is known that the Gadubanud people traded spear wood for Mount William green stone mined by the Wurundjeri when tribes from across Victoria met at traditional ceremonies at Mount Noorat, Mount Napier and Gariwerd. According to Clark "Ethnohistoric and linguistic information on the people of the Cape Otway Ranges is very thin."
Cape Otway has many middens which provide an indication of the varied diet of the Gadubanud. Fragments found in midderns include turban shells, abalone, periwinkle, elephant fish, chiton, beaked mussel and limpets. It is known that seals, cape barren geese, eels and ducks were also eaten, along with New Zealand spinach, tubers and berries. The Gadubanud made bark canoes for use in the rivers, lakes, estuaries and along the coast. Records from sailing ships reported Aboriginal people sailing close to shore in this region. 
During the 1830s Gadubanud successfully avoided interactions with European settlers. Early squatters thought the Otways were uninhabited. At least five clans are recorded including Bangura gundidj, Guringid gundidj, Ngalla gundidj, Ngarowurd gundidj and Yan Yan Gurt clan. The Gadubanud
were considered mainmait (wild) by neighbouring language groups the Wada Wurrung and Girai Wurring.
Language.
Little linguistic material has been recorded for the Gadubanud language. A connection with the Gulidjan to their north is suggested in the literature. The language was first identified by James Dawson in 1881 and means "King Parrot language"
History.
Chief Protector George Augustus Robinson on his trip to Port Fairy in 1842 met three Gadubanud people when he visited the mouth of the Hopkins River. From this interaction some clan information and territorial boundaries are recorded. In 1842 Gadubanud robbed an outstation for food and blankets.
Superintendent Charles La Trobe made three expeditions to reach Cape Otway, and on his third attempt in March 1846 came upon seven Gaduband men and women in the Aire valley.
Blanket Bay massacre.
Later in 1846 George D Smythe was contracted to survey the Otways. One of his surveying party, Conroy, was murdered by a party of Gadubanud, although there are no details on whether they may have been provoked in some way. Smythe returned to Melbourne to organise a retaliatory expedition which took place in August 1846. The party, which included several Wada Wurrung people, came across seven Gadubanud at the mouth of the Aire River and at Blanket Bay and attacked and killed them. A Report of this massacre was published in the Argus of 1 September 1846.
Ian Clark also reports that a number of further accounts have distorted the massacre by including rape and inflating the number killed, or attributing the attack to a detachment of Native Police Corps led by Foster Fyans.
One such story is by Aldo Massola who detailed the following account:
According to Clark, no more recorded interactions occurred after 1846 between the Gadubanud and European settlers.

The Immediate Gratification Players

The Immediate Gratification Players (IGP) are a collegiate improvisational comedy troupe based out of Harvard College. They specialize in long form, free-form improvisation and are recognized as one of the top college troupes in the nation. 
History.
The Immediate Gratification Players were founded by Harvard freshmen in the fall of 1986. Unlike the majority of collegiate troupes, the Immediate Gratification Players do not charge for admission to their on-campus shows. Their red-and-yellow striped ties are one of the troupe's hallmarks.
Each year, the Immediate Gratification Players host the Laugh Riot improvisational comedy festival at the American Repertory Theater. The invitational festival, begun in the spring of 1999 and now entering its 14th year, includes many troupes from other colleges, such as Cornell, Wesleyan University, and Columbia University. On the weekend of the annual Harvard-Yale football game, the Immediate Gratification Players either host or travel to a show which also stars an improvisational comedy troupe from Yale. Along with on-campus shows, they frequently play at Boston's Improv Asylum and at comedy clubs in New York City. Beyond the Northeast, the Immediate Gratification Players have played in Florida, Los Angeles, Texas, Chicago, San Francisco, and London.
Apart from a traditional long form, free-form, the Immediate Gratification Players annually perform shows in specialty forms such as the “dinner party” and “radio show” formats. In 2007, they were selected out of the numerous Boston-based improv troupes to star in a several comedy sketches produced by the Boston Globe in its Peter Post etiquette section. In 2010, they were selected to roast Wyclef Jean when he was named Artist of the Year by the Harvard Foundation. Shakira was honored in 2011 as the Harvard Foundation Artist of the Year, and again the Immediate Gratification Players were asked to roast her.
Immediate Gratification Player of the Year.
In 2010, the Immediate Gratification Players began honoring great comedians with a background in improvisational comedy as their Immediate Gratification Player of the Year. The award is not strictly annual, with the troupe's leader remarking that the group is "hoping to give this award as much as possible, devaluing it to the point where it basically means nothing." The award recipient performs the monologue portion of an Armando form show, where several scenes are based on the themes brought up in the monologue, which itself is formed from a crowd suggestion. Upon completion of the show, the honoree receives their own red-and-yellow striped tie.
The inaugural award recipient was comedian Jeff Garlin of Curb Your Enthusiasm and WALL-E fame. Garlin later wore his necktie on an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.
In 2011, Wayne Brady of ABC's Whose Line Is It Anyway was named the second Immediate Gratification Player of the Year.
First book.
In December 2010, the troupe released its first published book, an improv how-to guide aimed at students, entitled “So You Think You’re Funny: A Students’ Guide to Improv Comedy.” The book was published by Meriwether Publishing, which is known for other comedy publications such as "Truth in Comedy" by Del Close.

Arangottukara

Arangottukara is a small town in Thrissur district in the state of Kerala, India which is actually the border of palghat and thrissur districts. But in reality Arangotukara is a twin village consisting of two portions. One portion is known as Arangotukara (also as Arangode and Kizhakkum muri) which is in Thrissur District and the other portion is known as Ezhumangad (also as Padinhjattum muri). The infrastructures are divided between the two portions. These two portions are divided by a sub road running from a hill with the Desamangalam Rubber Estate in the North to the end of Arangotukara in the South. Right side of the road that is the East side, is Arangotukara and the left side is Ezhumangad. The main road of the area is a State Road connecting Shornoor (a railway junction of Southern Railway of the Indian Railways), Ottapalam (Thaluk head quarters), Palakkad town (District head quarters) and Thrissur (headquarter of District) on the East to Kunnamkulam and Guruvayur on the West.
The Ezhumangad portion is under the Thirumittakode Panchayath, Ottapalam Thaluk under Palakkad District of Kerala State in India. This portion is having the Aided Upper Primary School of the village. This school is about 90 years old, founded by A R Krishna Iyer of Chakkali Madam. The Ezhumangad portion is having the main shopping center of the twin villages. Ezhumangad (Padinhgattumuri) is having the Ezhumangad Mahadeva Kshethra (temple) and the Mullakkal Durga Devi temple. The Mahadeva temple is one of the oldest temples in the area. Sivarathri (night of Lord Siva) is the main festival of this temple. The Mullakkal temple is having the annual festival of 'Thalappoli' (a procession of ladies with traditional dresses carrying a plate with a lighted oil lamp with the accompaniment of Panchavadyam (an orchestra producing rhythmic sound) and Thayampaka (a long drum played to produce rhythmic sound), an Oracle (Velichappadu – a male with long hair dressed with auspicious red color dress carrying a sword in right hand and chilambu – a brass hollow oval shaped ring with small balls inside which makes sounds when the balls move), and the population of the village. The procession will follow the decorated (caparisoned) elephants numbering about 15 to 30 depending on the availability. This procession starts from the main temple of the village in the Arangotukara portion known as Karthyayani Devi Temple to the Mullakkal Devi Temple. This portion of the village is having a library established in the year 1943 known as the Vidya Poshini (enhancing knowledge) Public Library with a reading room. This library got the award of the best library of the Palakkad District recently.
The Arangotukara portion of the village is in Desamangalam Panchayath, Thalappilli Thaluk, Trichur District, Kerala State in India. The post office is in the Arangotukara portion. This portion is having one of the oldest rubber estates known as the Desamangalam Rubber Estate, Arangotukara. This portion also has the Karthyayani Temple near the South side and another temple known as the Thrikovil Ambalam (Sacred temple) at the North side. The Karthyayani Devi Temple is dedicated to the goddess Durga with two festivals annually. One is the Dussarah festival lasting for 10 days during the period of September – October. The other one is Karthika deepam festival of one day. The Thrikovil Ambalam is dedicated to Narasimha Swamy (god with the head of a lion and body of a man) one of the incarnations of Lord Maha Vishnu. This temple's pond (tank) known as the Thrikkai Kulam (sacred palm pond) is about two acres in area. The legend is that this tank was made by the pressing of the palm of Sage (maharishi) Agasthyan or Ashtavakran.Arangottukara is now developing to a town in all manners.the growth in economy makes developments in.so many shops,banks,clinics etc. supports the development.in near future arangottukara will become a small town.There are couple of art schools for developing the talents of children is also here.Ezhumangad will grow as a big residential area in near future.

Sierolomorphidae

The Sierolomorphidae are a family of about 10 known species of wasps, all in the genus Sierolomorpha, found in the Northern Hemisphere. They are rare and very little is known of their biology.
The coxa (basal segment of the leg) of the hind and midlegs are next to each other, and the hindwing does not have claval or jugal lobes. The first metasomal segment does not have a true node, but can appear like that of the ants. The metasomal sternum of the first segment is separated from the second by a constriction. Sexual dimorphism varies among species from slight to marked, with both males and females having wings, but females are sometimes wingless. Adults are predominantly dark brown or black in colour. They are solitary and the larvae are suspected to be ectoparasitoids of other insects.

Past Three O'Clock

"Past Three O'Clock" (or "Past Three A Clock") is a Christmas carol, loosely based on the traditional cry of the city night watchman:
The words were written by George Ratcliffe Woodward (1848–1934) to the traditional tune "London Waits". Woodward added lines to the traditional refrain in a style characteristic of his delight in archaic poetry. It was published in "A Cambridge Carol Book: Being Fifty-two Songs for Christmas, Easter and Other Seasons" in 1924.
Numerous variations of the carol include an arrangement by William Llewellyn as a "quodlibet" for choir: "London Waits (Past Three O'clock)".
Recordings of the carol include those by the Choir of Clare College, Cambridge, the Choir of King's College, Cambridge, and the Monteverdi Choir.
Popular music artistes who have recorded the carol include Linda Ronstadt on the album "A Merry Little Christmas" (2000).

Red Ensign of Singapore

The Red Ensign of Singapore is a civil ensign used by privately owned, non-military ships that are registered in Singapore. The overall design of the ensign is a modification of the national flag, with the ratio of the width to the length extended to 1:2. The ensign was created by law in 1966. The use of this ensign is regulated by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). According to the MPA, the Red Ensign is the only ensign to be used on Singaporean civilian ships, and the national flag is not an acceptable substitute. The ensign must be hoisted on all Singaporean ships on entering or leaving port.
History.
In 1966, a year after Singapore's independence from Malaysia, a document entitled "Singapore Merchant Marine Ensign" and numbered Misc. 5 of 1966, was laid before Parliament on 6 September 1966 by the Deputy Prime Minister. The document created a civil ensign that was to be used on ships registered in Singapore. The Red Ensign has been in use since then.
Design.
According to the Parliamentary paper Misc. 5 of 1966, the background of the ensign is red with the ratio of its width to its length being one by two. In contrast, the ratio of the national flag of Singapore is two by three. In the centre of the ensign is a white ring, which surrounds a crescent and five stars also coloured white. The five stars are arranged such that they form a pentagon in the middle. The crescent and stars are taken from the national flag, although in the ensign the crescent appears underneath rather than to the left of the stars. According to a 1999 circular "National Colours for Singapore Ships" issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the red colour of the civil ensign is the same as that of the national flag. The shade of red has been defined by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts as Pantone 032.
Construction sheet.
The MPA's 1999 circular includes a construction sheet with detailed dimensions for the manufacture of the flag. The sheet is in inches and centimetres. The overall dimensions of the flag are by . The space between the top of the ensign to the top of the ring, and the bottom of the ring to the bottom of the ensign, is . The outer diameter of the ring is , and the ring itself is in thickness. The outer curve of the crescent has a radius of . Each star fits within a circle with a diameter of , and the centres of the five stars are positioned 72° from each other along the circumference of an imaginary circle with a radius of . The centre of the imaginary circle is from the lowest point of the inner curve of the crescent.
Regulations.
Section 36(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1995 empowers the relevant Minister to prescribe an ensign for Singaporean ships, which shall then be the "proper colours for a Singapore ship." Section 36(2) goes on to state that the master of a ship, the ship's owner if he is on board, and any other person hoisting colours may be fined up to S$1,000 if, instead of the Red Ensign, any other "distinctive national colours" are hoisted on board any Singapore ship without the Minister's consent. Under section 37 of the Act, if a Singapore ship fails to hoist the Red Ensign on entering or leaving any port, the ship master may be fined up to $1,000.
The MPA's 1999 circular calls the attention of owners, masters and officers of Singapore ships to sections 36 and 37 of the Merchant Shipping Act. In particular, paragraph 3 of the circular points out that "the Singapore national flag does not the Red Ensign".

In 1981, she met her French, Israeli-born husband, David Cohen, and they set up their company, Betty Jackson Ltd. They have worked together ever since.
For much of her career, it was believed that Betty Jackson had lost a leg in a car accident in 1971, during her last year of college. However, on 27 August 2009, in the BBC Radio 4 programme "No Triumph, No Tragedy", it was revealed that her leg was amputated at the age of six as it failed to grow following a dislocation during her birth. The car accident caused further complications and she has walked with a stick ever since. 
She has two children. Her daughter, Pascale, works for a jewellery designer in New York and her son, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, is an actor.
Career.
In 1973, Jackson joined Wendy Dagworthy as her design assistant. She moved to further positions at Quorum, then Coopers, before setting up her own design company.

As a member of an advisory panel to the British Fashion Council's Model Health Inquiry, Jackson has been involved in the so-called 'size zero' <debate. After the death in 2006 of two models suffering from eating disorders, media attention was drawn to the health and size of the girls. Jackson agreed to join the panel.ref></ref> 
In 2008, Jackson worked as design consultant alongside a panel of judges, designing new gowns for High Court and Court of Appeal judges.

San Pier Maggiore is a former church in Pistoia, Tuscany, central Italy. The church is notable for its exterior polychrome decorations, one of the last examples in the city.
The church probably dates to Lombard times. It was enlarged in 1086 and again in 1124, receiving its current appearance in 1263. The central portal's architrave is attributed to the workshop of Guido da Como, and depicts a "Jesus Giving the Keys to St. Peter, with the Virgin and the Apostles". The façade has maintained the original Romanesque appearance, and, like the nearby church of San Bartolomeo in Pantano, is divided into five compartments with bichrome decoration.
In 1640 the interior was largely restored and enriched with Baroque-style decorations. Today the church is deconsecrated, the former convent housing the State Institute of Arts. In the matronaeum are exhibited work by the Pistoiese sculptor Andrea Lippi.

From a military point of view, the attempt was futile and it was over within 24 hours. Rebels stormed 24 police stations, 17 in Hamburg and seven in Schleswig-Holstein Province in Prussia. Over 100 people died during the uprising. The exact details of the uprising, as well as the assessment of its impact, are controversial to this day.
Background.
Between 1919 and 1923, the Weimar Republic was in crisis and there were many violent conflicts between left- and right-wing elements. The economic situation of the population was rapidly deteriorating and hyperinflation was at its peak, which brought gains in popularity to the Communist Party. The occupation of the Ruhr region further radicalized the political disputes. In August 1923, there was a wave of nation-wide strikes against Reich Chancellor Wilhelm Cuno. At the end of September, the government declared a state of emergency. On 1 October, the Black Reichswehr attempted the Küstrin Putsch. Two weeks later, on 13 October, the Reichstag adopted an enabling act that was to facilitate a de jure dictatorship by Chancellor Gustav Stresemann. A demonstration of several thousand unemployed stormed the "forbidden zone" around the city hall, an action which, during this period, risked death at the hands of the police and right-wing paramilitaries. In Saxony and Thuringia, coalition governments were formed that included the KPD, which saw this as an opportunity to take over.
Within the international Communist movement, there was discussion of an attempted armed rebellion in Germany. Leon Trotsky and other Influential members of the Soviet Politburo and the Comintern advanced the idea, but Heinrich Brandler, head of the KPD, felt it was premature. The exact motives of the small Hamburg group led by Hugo Urbahns and Hans Kippenberger, who planned the uprising, remain unknown.
The Uprising.
Late on 22 October 1923, the military leader of the "KP Wasserkante" received orders via the regional party leadership to begin the rebellion. Only 300 took an active part in the rebellion. although the Hamburg KPD numbered some 14,000 members. On 23 October at 5:00 a.m., they stormed 26 police precincts and took weapons from 17 of them.
There was also activity in Altona and the urban district of Stormarn, where the police stations in Schiffbek and Bramfeld were attacked and weapons taken. In Bad Oldesloe, Ahrensburg and Rahlstedt, train tracks and streets were blockaded. In the town of Bargteheide, insurgents arrested local government leaders and proclaimed the "Soviet Republic of Stormarn". In Schiffbek, where the KPD had support, placards were posted to calm residents and to urge support for the uprising, declaring "Long live Soviet Germany! Long live the Federation of Soviet states of the world! Long live the world revolution!"
Most of the uprising was quelled in a few hours. In Schiffbek, it lasted till just past noon. Only in Barmbek, where the KPD had received some 20% of the vote in the previous election, the insurgents were supported by residents, who helped them build barricades and brought them food. The rebels were able to maintain their position during the entire day, despite the continuous exchange of gunfire. At night, however, convinced of the hopelessness of their situation, they sneaked away. The next day, the police launched a major offensive against empty barricades.
Aftermath.
The Uprising claimed at least 100 lives and more than 300 were injured. Of the dead were 17 police officers, 24 rebels and 61 innocent bystanders. There were 1,400 people arrested. In Schiffbek alone, 191 people were arrested and later, in February 1925, had to be tried at the Altona Landgericht because of unrest in Schiffbeck, where the KPD had garnered 32.4% of the vote in the May 1924 election. This was the largest of the trials against the Uprising insurgents.
The Uprising contributed to the deteriorating relationship between the two working class political parties. After the Uprising, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) refused to work with the KPD and even intensified the repression of the KPD by reinforcing the government's positions. Rejection by both the Republic and the SPD strengthened the Communists. Within the KPD, the Uprising became a heroic legend about the "courageous" few rebels facing a hopeless fight. The defeat of the Uprising was interpreted as the consequence of too little centralization and too little obedience to party-oriented structures and evidence that these must be increased.
Sections of the middle class saw in the Uprising their fears of a Bolshevik Revolution confirmed and became more attracted to anti-communist politics. As a result, in the 1924 Hamburg Reichstag election, the German National People's Party saw their share of the votes rise from 12% to about 20%, though it quickly dropped back to around 12% in 1928.

San Bartolomeo in Pantano

San Bartolomeo in Pantano is a church in Pistoia, Tuscany, central Italy, dedicated to St. Bartholomew the Apostle. The "pantano" of the name refers to the once marshy area in which the building was located.
History.
The church and the annexed abbey were founded during the Lombard domination of Italy, between 726 and 764, by the Lombard physician Gaiduald. Here a group of Benedictines were established under the protection of the Marquises of Tuscany. The complex was first restored in the 12th century by Abbot Buono.
In 1433 the Benedictines were replaced by Lateranense Canons, member of the Augustinian Order. When they were suppressed, the monastery was given to the Vallumbrosan Order, which remained here in 1810, the church then becoming a parish church.
Overview.
The church gained its present appearance at the time of Buono in 1159, being in the Pistoiese Romanesque style. Characteristic of this style is the façade, divided into five compartments with arches supported by slender columns, and with a marble bichrome decoration. The facade has notable examples of Romanesque art in the lions sculptures of the façade corners and of the portal, and the architrave depicting "Jesus with the Twelve Apostles" (dated to 1167).
The interior was much changed over the centuries, but a restoration held in 1951-1961 brought it to the original appearance. In the apse was found a "Christ in Majesty between Saints and Angels" from the late 13th century, attributed to one Manfredino d'Alberto. The pulpit sculpted in the mid 13th century by Guido da Como was also restored. The wooden crucifix in the high altar is from an unknown sculptor with a style resembling that of Giovanni Pisano.

Strengths and weaknesses of evolution

"Strengths and weaknesses of evolution" is a controversial phrase that has been proposed for (and in Texas introduced into) public school science curricula. Those proposing the phrase, such as the chairman of the Texas State Board of Education (SBOE), Don McLeroy, purport that there are weaknesses in the theory of evolution and in the evidence that life has evolved that should be taught for a balanced treatment of the subject of evolution. The scientific community rejects that any substantive weaknesses exist in the scientific theory, or in the data that it explains, and views the examples that have been given in support of the phrasing as being without merit and long refuted.
This has led scientists and journalists to conclude that the phrase is a creationist tactic to introduce religion into science courses. The phrase was introduced by the SBOE in the late 1980s. Since then it has been promoted in California and Missouri. In late 2008, it became a highly publicized issue as the Texas SBOE held public hearings on whether this language should be removed from the curriculum. According to the National Center for Science Education, the phrase, like 'Teach the controversy' and 'Critical Analysis of Evolution', is an attempt in a series of legal and political tactics adopted by intelligent design advocates to encourage educators to teach fallacious information — that a controversy exists among scientists over whether evolution has occurred.
History.
Texas SBOE.
The "strengths and weaknesses" language was included in the curriculum standards in Texas to appease creationists when the SBOE first mandated the teaching of evolution in the late 1980s.
In 2003, the "strengths and weaknesses" language in the standards was employed by members of the board in an unsuccessful attempt to dilute the treatment of evolution in the biology textbooks they were considering.
In September 2008 the 21st Century Science Coalition released a petition to remove the phrase "strengths and weaknesses" from the public school guidelines for science classrooms in Texas. As of November 2008, 588 scientists at Texas universities and 777 other scientists across the state have signed the petition.
In the summer of 2008/2009 the Texas SBOE is determining the curriculum for the next decade, including deciding whether the "strengths and weaknesses" of evolution should be taught. While this language was described by the New York Times as a "benign-sounding phrase", they mention that critics state that it is a new strategy to undermine the teaching of evolution, and for students to hear religious objections under the heading of scientific discourse. The SBOE Chairman, Don McLeroy, a Young Earth creationist dentist from Central Texas, denied that the language "is subterfuge for bringing in creationism." McLeroy views the debate as being between "two systems of science" — "a creationist system and a naturalist system". These views have alarmed Texas educators, including former chairman of the department of medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas Dan Foster, who stated that "erious students will not come to study in our universities if Texas is labeled scientifically backward".
In December 2008, the San Antonio Express-News stated in an editorial that the Texas SBOE has a "long history of trying to water down the science curriculum with criticisms of evolution that lack scientific credibility."
In January 2009, the Texas SBOE voted to remove the 'Strengths and Weaknesses" language, but its conservative faction, led by Don McLeroy, managed to pass several amendments to the science curriculum that opponents describe as opening the door to teaching objections to evolution that might lead students to reject it. These included one amendent that compels science teachers to teach about aspects of the fossil record that do not neatly fit with gradualism, but rather show the relatively sudden appearance of some species while others seem to remain unchanged for millions of years. Prominent University of Texas biology professor David Hillis described the amendments as "makno sense to me ... It's a clear indication that the chairman of the state school board doesn’t understand the science." Board member Ken Mercer, who voted to keep "strengths and weaknesses" described his support for the language in explicitly religious terms: "It's an issue of freedom of religion." This view was contradicted by fellow social conservative board member Barbara Cargill, who stated "his isn’t about religion."
On March 13, 2009 a bill (HB 4224) was introduced in the Texas House of Representatives that would require the Texas SBOE to restore the "strengths and weaknesses" language in the state science standards.
California.
In 2003 and 2004, creationist lawyer Larry Caldwell sought to persuade the Roseville Joint Union High School District Board of Trustees to adopt a policy which included teaching "the scientific strengths and weaknesses" of evolution. When this was rejected, he filed a complaint in federal court against the district, alleging that his civil rights were violated during the controversy, resulting in a summary judgment against him in September 2007.
Discovery Institute.
In February 2008 the Discovery Institute created an Academic Freedom petition that stated "Teachers should be protected from being fired, harassed, intimidated, or discriminated against for objectively presenting the scientific strengths and weaknesses of Darwinian theory."
Missouri.
In February 2009, House Bill 656, introduced in the Missouri House of Representatives, proposed that "teachers shall be permitted to help students understand, analyze, critique, and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of theories of biological and chemical evolution." This bill died when the Missouri legislative session ended on May 15, 2009.
Tennessee.
On February 9, 2011, Tennessee House of Representatives member Bill Dunn introduced House Bill 368, which states that "teachers shall be permitted to help students understand, analyze, critique, and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of existing scientific theories covered in the course being taught." On February 16, 2011, Tennessee State Senator Bo Watson introduced an identical bill, Senate Bill 893. The House Bill was passed by the House Education Committee on March 29, 2011, and referred to the House Calendar and Rules Committee. Alan I. Leshner, the Chief Executive Officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and Executive Publisher of the journal Science, wrote to the House of Representatives opposing the Bill, stating "There is virtually no scientific controversy among the overwhelming majority of researchers on the core facts of global warming and evolution. Asserting that there are significant scientific controversies about the overall nature of these concepts when there are none will only confuse students, not enlighten them."
Educational and scientific value.
While anti-evolution members of the Texas SBOE have claimed their "weaknesses" campaign has nothing to do with faith, that "We're not putting religion in books", scientists have rebutted that these weaknesses are simply falsehoods. Scientists testified at the state board hearing in November 2008 that evolution is a scientific theory, not a hypothesis and thus does not have weaknesses.
Some scientists, including Andrew Ellington, professor of biochemistry at the University of Texas, and Robert Dennison, Houston Independent School District's AP science lead teacher, are concerned that the mention of "weaknesses" in the curriculum standards has had a chilling effect on science teachers.
In a survey commissioned by the Texas Freedom Network, "94% of Texas scientists indicated that claimed "weaknesses" are not valid scientific objections to evolution (with 87% saying that they “strongly disagree” that such weaknesses should be considered valid)."
Specific weaknesses and their scientific rebuttals.
Supporters of the 'strengths and weaknesses of evolution' language have proposed the following as weaknesses of evolution, and the scientific community has responded with the following rebuttals:

Mopah Range

The Mopah Range is a desert mountain range, in the Lower Colorado River Valley region, in southeastern San Bernardino County, California.
Geography.
The Mopah Range are located directly adjacent to and linked with the larger Turtle Mountains Range. They are in the northern Colorado Desert region of the Sonoran Desert, and the southern reach of Mojave Desert.
The Colorado River and Whipple Mountains are to the east, and the Iron Mountains to the west. Vidal Junction, California is to the southeast, and the Colorado River Aqueduct passes to the south.
Turtle Mountains Wilderness Area.
The Mopah Range is part of the Turtle Mountains Wilderness Area. The Mopahs include broad bajadas to highly eroded volcanic peaks, spires, and cliffs. The Mopah Range contains the two signature Mopah Peaks, which are rhyodactic or volcanic plugs. The northern most peak is a landmark known as Mexican Hat. The area has numerous springs and seeps. The Mopahs are considered part of the greater Lower Colorado River Valley region.
Natural history.
The Mopah Range is located in an ecological transition zone between the Mojave Desert ("High Desert") and Colorado Desert region of the Sonoran Desert ("Low Desert") and therefore contains a high diversity of plant and animal species. The Turtle Mountain range is a northern or southern 'delimiter of occurrence' for some species; for example the endangered California Fan Palm, "Washingtonia filifera", encounters the northern limit of its range in the Mopah-Turtle Mountains.
Dominate vegetation in the Turtle Mountains Wilderness Area consists of the creosote bush-bur sage with Creosote bush ("Larrea tridentata") and the palo verde-cactus shrub ecosystems with the Palo Verde tree ("Parkinsonia microphylla"). In the washes, Colorado/Sonoran microphylla woodlands can be found. These woodlands include such things as Smoke Tree ("Psorothamnus spinosus"), Honey Mesquite ("Prosopis velutina"), and Catclaw ("Acacia greggii").
Wildlife species include Desert Bighorn Sheep, coyote, black-tailed jackrabbits, ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, quail, roadrunners, golden eagles, prairie falcons, rattlesnakes, the Desert Tortoise and several species of lizards.
Recreation.
Hiking, horseback riding, camping, rock hounding, photography, and backpacking can be enjoyed in this wilderness. The area is popular with rock hounding hobbyists and is nationally known for chalcedony specimens in a form known as "Mopah Roses." Coffin, Mopah, and Mohawk Springs, natural palm oases, are popular hiking destinations.

Rewilding (conservation biology)

Rewilding is large-scale conservation aimed at restoring and protecting natural processes and core wilderness areas, providing connectivity between such areas, and protecting or reintroducing apex predators and keystone species. Rewilding projects may require ecological restoration, particularly to restore connectivity between fragmented protected areas, and reintroduction of predators where extirpated.
Origin.
The word "rewilding" was coined by conservationist and activist Dave Foreman, one of the founders of the group Earth First! who went on to help establish both the Wildlands Project (now the Wildlands Network) and the Rewilding Institute. The term first occurred in print in 1990. The concept was further defined and expanded by conservation biologists Michael Soulé and Reed Noss in a paper published in 1998. According to Soulé and Noss, rewilding is a conservation method based on "cores, corridors, and carnivores." The concepts of cores, corridors, and carnivores were further expanded upon in "Continental Conservation: Scientific Foundations of Regional Reserve Networks", (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 1999), edited by Soulé and John Terborgh. Dave Foreman subsequently wrote the first full-length exegesis of rewilding as a conservation strategy in "Rewilding North America: A Vision for Conservation in the 21st Century" (Island Press, 2004).
History.
As a method to preserve intact, functional ecosystems and stem biodiversity loss, rewilding is based on recent scientific breakthroughs in the field of island biogeography and discoveries concerning the ecological importance of large carnivores. The publication of "The Theory of Island Biogeography", by Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson in 1967 established the importance of considering the size and isolation of existing or proposed protected areas: The theory suggested that small, isolated protected areas were vulnerable to extinctions. The theory was firmly established following the publication of William D. Newmark's study of extinctions in national parks in North America. 
MacArthur and Wilson's book launched a period of intense debate over how conservation could best be accomplished, as described in David Quammen's popular history, "The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction". With the creation of the Society for Conservation Biology in 1985, conservationists began to focus on finding solutions to the problems of habitat loss and fragmentation. Increasingly, both at the grassroots level and in the programs of international non-governmental conservation organizations, those solutions involved rewilding.
Major rewilding projects.
Rewilding has been incorporated into plans and projects implemented by both grassroots groups and major international conservation organizations. These projects aim to protect and restore large-scale core wilderness areas, corridors (or connectivity) between them, and apex predators, carnivores, or keystone species (species which interact strongly with the environment, such as elephant and beaver). Since the publication of that foundational paper, rewilding projects have been launched around the world: They include corridor projects, such as the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative in North America (also known as Y2Y) and the European Green Belt, built along the former Iron Curtain; transboundary projects, including those in southern Africa funded by the Peace Parks Foundation; community-conservation projects, such as the wildlife conservancies of Namibia and Kenya; and projects organized around ecological restoration, including Gondwana Link, regrowing native bush in a hotspot of endemism in southwest Australia, and the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, restoring dry tropical forest and rainforest in Costa Rica. These and other projects are described in Caroline Fraser's "Rewilding the World: Dispatches from the Conservation Revolution" (Metropolitan Books, 2009). European Wildlife, established in 2008, is currently advocating establishment of a „European Centre of Biodiversity“ at the German–Austrian–Czech borders. 
Another major North American rewilding effort focused on restoring the prairie grasslands of the Great Plains is described in Richard Manning's "Rewilding the West: Restoration in a Prairie Landscape". Manning describes how the American Prairie Foundation is reintroducing bison on private land in the Missouri Breaks region of north-central Montana, with the aim of creating a prairie preserve larger than Yellowstone National Park.
Pleistocene rewilding.
Pleistocene rewilding was first proposed by Paul S. Martin, in his book," Twilight of the Mammoths: Ice Age Extinctions and the Rewilding of America" (University of California Press, 2005). Noting that much of the original megafauna of North America—including mammoths, ground sloths, and sabre-toothed cats—became extinct after the arrival of Homo sapiens on the continent, Martin proposed reintroducing large mammals such as African and Asian elephants, in order to restore ecological balance that was lost.
A controversial 2005 editorial in "Nature", signed by a number of conservation biologists, took up the argument, urging that elephants, lions, and cheetahs could be reintroduced in protected areas in the Great Plains. The Bolson tortoise, discovered in 1959 in Durango, Mexico, was the first species proposed for this restoration effort, and in 2006 the species was reintroduced to two ranches in New Mexico owned by media mogul Ted Turner. The argument has been proposed first by a Brazilian ecologist, Mauro Galetti but because it was published in a obscure journal, it was ignored by many authors until now.
In 1988, researcher Sergey A. Zimov created a Pleistocene Park in northeastern Siberia to test the possibility of restoring a full range of grazers and predators and thus restore the so-called "mammoth ecosystem." Yakutian horses, reindeer, snow sheep, elk and moose were reintroduced, and reintroduction is also planned for yak, bactrian camels, red deer, and Siberian tigers. The wood bison, a close relative of the ancient bison that died out in Siberia 1000 or 2000 years ago is also an important species for the ecology of Siberia. In 2006, 30 bison calves were flown from Edmonton, Alberta to Yakutsk; they are currently in the government-run reserve of Ust'-Buotama.
Pleistocene rewilding remains controversial: A recent letter published in "Conservation Biology" accuses the Pleistocene camp of promoting "Frankenstein ecosystems," noting that "the biggest problem is not the possibility of failing to restore lost interactions, but rather the risk of getting new, unwanted interactions instead." The authors proposed that—rather than trying to restore a lost megafauna—conservationists should dedicate themselves to restoring existing species to their original habitats. 
In 2012, Elizabeth Kolbert, an environmental journalist at "The New Yorker", reported on the reintroduction of Heck cattle, intended as an grazing replacement for the extinct aurochs, on reclaimed land in the Netherlands in "Recall of the Wild." The article discusses the origins of Heck cattle (a breed that originated with the Nazis) and the controversies sparked by Pleistocene rewilding; it describes "model rewilding areas" envisioned and supported by the group Rewilding Europe, founded in 2009.

All Saints' Church, Newchurch

All Saints' Church, Newchurch is a parish church in the Church of England located in Newchurch, Isle of Wight, England. The church is medieval dating from the 13th century. In 1883, restoration of the church was carried out by A.R. Barker, at the instigation of the vicar Rev. Alfred Dicker.
The simple layout of the church consists of a nave, a chancel, northern and southern aisles, and a tower. It was built on the site of an older structure which was donated by William FitzOsbern to the Lyre Abbey. Subsequently, the church came under the control of the Beaulieu Abbey. When this religious authority was dissolved, the control of the church was entrusted by Henry VIII to the Bishop of Bristol (now Gloucester and Bristol).
The church was one of the seven parishes on the Island when it was built, but now is part of several others. The unique white timber clad tower contains a small peal of six bells with a tenor weighing just 7 cwt or 350 kg.
Geography.
All Saints' Church is located at the north end of the village of Newchurch. On the west side of the church, the road has a steep descent which gives the impression that the church is on a bluff. The geographic setting has been described by Venables, a poet as: "To the north the gazes embraces the whole of the vale of Newchurch with the undulating ridge of the chalks down beyond, ending towards the valley of the Medina in the abrupt Slope of the St.George’s Down. The white cliffs of Culver…"
History.
All Saints' Church is an ancient cruciform structure. Although it was one of the six churches given by William FitzOsbern to an Lyra Abbey in Normandy, Henry VIII was later to give it to the See of Bristol. Living quarters are in a vicarage which included 3 acres of glebe.
Architecture.
Exterior.
The church of All Saints' is a 13th-century cruciform structure with a south porch. The exterior features a red-tiled roof, walls of rough sandstone, a weatherboarded tower, a south porch, and a short spire. The nave's roof and the exterior of the north aisle appear barn-like.
Interior.
The earliest building must have been of the 12th century, as there evidence of 13th century additions. The transept piers do not bond into the east wall of the nave, which, with its thick wall, probably formed part of the original church. The eastern arches of the aisles spring from plain-splayed imposts, and the starting pier of the south aisle does not bond into the west wall.
The 13th century builders practically remodelled the whole structure, leaving it much as it is today—a nave of three bays, a fourth being formed by the transept arches, north and south aisles, a long chancel, north and south transepts and a south porch supporting a wooden tower containing six bells. The massive piers at the entrance to the transepts suggest a central tower. Both transepts are singularly deep and must have been original features, though the south one has been lengthened , probably in the 16th century when the east window was inserted. The aisles must have been undertaken later in the century, as they are not in alignment with the transept piers. They both end in pointed arches, that to the north being splayed inwards for some ritual purpose, while the south one was rebuilt when the way to the rood-loft was cut through in the 15th century. The south wall of the nave is lighted by 14th century windows with cusped heads, and has been raised to admit of their insertion. The north wall is pierced by two windows and a door of the 13th century, the westernmost window having been converted into a single round-headed light in the 17th century.
The entrance to the roof-loft still remains, with its steps on the aisle side. It has a semicircular head, from which springs the cross arch of the aisle with its two rings of voussoirs.
In the south wall is a priest's door. For some structural reason, its east and south walls have been rebuilt in the 16th century, and it is probable that at this time, the south transept was lengthened and the porch widened eastward to form the sub-structure of a wooden tower containing the three bells mentioned in the inventory of 1553. The west wall of the nave appears to be all of one date—c. 1200— and is pierced with three original windows, a small narrow lancet in each aisle, a circular window with simple cusped filling in the centre of the gable. The crown of the west entrance has been lowered to admit of the insertion of a large 'churchwarden' window and the external jambs have been replaced with plain cut stone.
It is probable that the Dillingtons were responsible for the churchwarden creations in the north transept, and the west wall, and the final remodelling of the tower. There are two small chapels succeeding the two transepts. Over the gable of the south transeptal chapel, a “singular SAINTS or SANCTE BELL turret" has been erected (the bell was first struck when the image of the Saint was deified). In the porch, there are inscriptions in Latin on two tablets that record the generous contribution made by Richard Gard to establishing a grammar school which was founded by Richard Andrews, in 1595.
The oak pulpit with its quaint sounding-board and canopy, as also the carved 'Pelican' lectern said to have been brought from Frome, belong to the Dillington period. There are memorials (eight inscriptions) in the north transept to the Dillington family, 1674 to 1749, wall tablets to Lieutenant General Maurice Bockland (Member of Parliament from Yarmouth; d. 1765), W. Bowles (d. 1748), an author, and William Thatcher, 1776. Over the south door is a panel with the royal arms of William III, dated 1700.
The chancel, unusually long for its width, is lighted on the north by the three blunt lancets already referred to, on the east and south by three-light 16th century windows. The original north wall of the chancel still remains with its blunt-lancet, ungrooved window openings. Over the chancel arch is a wide splayed lancet window or opening of early 13th century detail. The transept and chancel arches are very massive in appearance, with pointed heads and triple-splayed orders springing from slightly curved abaci, forming a continuous moulding round the piers. This responds in clumsy square bases the whole thickness of the wall, as if intended for a stop to some feature since removed. A chancel roof space is of unknown purpose.
In the 17th and 18th centuries, a certain amount of renovation was done by the Dillingtons, then owners of Knighton Gorges Manor. Both transepts appealed to them as excellent places for family vaults, so in 1688, Sir Robert Dillington (ca. 1664–1689) obtained a faculty to build a vault in the north transept. In 1725, the south transept received their attention as a further burial place for the family, the Dillington baronetcy having become extinct four years earlier.
Fittings.
There are six bells, four of which were founded in 1810 by Thomas Mears of London; the other two are inscribed 'ANNO 5189 . ANTHONY BOND MADE ME 1626.' The ancient communion pieces consist of a chalice high and in diameter, with the date 1620 pricked on the cover. The alms-dish is inscribed 'The gift of Mrs. Dillington to the Parish of Newchurch anno 1737.' There is also a Sheffield plate flagon, probably given at the same time, inscribed 'DEO ET ALTARI SACRUM.' A register has records of many events since 1582, and which includes information of a Chichester earthquake that occurred on 30 November 1811 at 3.20 am, which was felt in Portsmouth at Rydes and in many other parts of the Isle of Wight.
The church has a pipe organ by Bevington dating from 1857. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

Church of Sant' Andrea, Pistoia

The Church of Sant' Andrea, Pistoia, (Pieve di Sant'Andrea) is a church in Pistoia, Tuscany, central Italy that serves as a "pieve" or place that congregations from surrounding village churches use for baptism. It is dedicated to St. Andrew the Apostle, and includes the famous Pulpit of Sant' Andrea by Giovanni Pisano. The church probably dates from as early as the 8th century, though in a smaller size. In the 12th century it was extended in length. 
The façade shows the typical bichrome marble decoration of the Pistoiese Romanesque style, executed in the mid-12th century by Gruamonte and his brother Adeodatus, who was also responsible for the sculptures and for the portal's architrave. The latter depicts the "Journey of the Magi", a rare theme whose use here derives from the fact that the church was located on the Via Francigena, by which, in the Middle Ages, the pilgrims reached Rome from France. The decorated capitals are by a Master Henry, while the small statue of St. Andrew in the lunette over the portal is reminiscent of Giovanni Pisano's style.
In the late 15th century the upper façade was finished and the central nave was vaulted. The frescoes in the apse date to 1506, executed by Bernardino del Signoraccio. Today only the central part, with the "Father supported by Four Angels", survives. The altars in the aisles were added in the 17th century, with paintings by artists such as Cristofano Allori and Girolamo Scag.

Lego Modular Houses

Modular Buildings is a series of Lego building toy sets introduced in 2007. Created in response to feedback and suggestions from the Adult Fans of Lego (AFOL), and the Teen Fans of Lego (TFOL) community, the sets in this series are generally intended for more advanced builders with most sets containing more than 2,000 total pieces and making use of unorthodox building techniques which have not been tried before in official Lego sets. In contrast to most Lego sets which are aimed at children and adolescents, the suggested age of most sets in the Modular Buildings series is 16 years or older. The Modular Buildings sets have been received with positive reviews, being considered by Lego designers and fans as "toys for adults". The sets include Market Street, Cafe Corner, Green Grocer, Fire Brigade, Grand Emporium, Pet Shop, Town Hall, Palace Cinema, and the newest model, Parisian Restaurant
Overview.
All sets in the series can also be joined together to form a larger "neighbourhood" layout of several buildings standing adjacent to each other. Connectors at the base of the models are aligned for easy connection with other models in the series.
History.
In 2006, a poll was taken, aimed at the AFOL community. Adult fans were asked to share their ideas and opinions of what concept they would like to see for a future model from the Lego Group. Some of the ideas submitted were: more town and everyday buildings, structures with more architectural detail, realistic buildings, minifigure scale buildings, solid and enclosed buildings, and more. These ideas were taken into consideration and a year later the first set in the Modular Buildings series, Café Corner, was released. A Lego fan was invited to provide feedback and suggestions during the design of that set.
Sets.
To date, 9 sets have been released in the series, averaging about one new set each year.
Café Corner.
Café Corner (set number: 10182) was the first of the Modular Buildings series. It was originally released in April 2007. The set contains 2085 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 years of age or older. Some of the set features include a 3 floor building set on a street corner, a vertical 'Hotel' sign, opening doors and windows, café tables and umbrellas, a striped awning and 3 minifigures. Many advanced building techniques were used such as: annexes, fanned ski shoes as decoration, a hotel sign using a SNOT technique (studs not on top), angled corner, and a 3D façade.
During development of this first set in the series, the designers considered the cost of several options. One more expensive version had additional café features, dark green interior walls, a bike and an additional minifigure. In contrast, a lower cost version of the set was considered which lacked rear exterior walls, interior stairs, and extra interior walls on the second floor, and had only 2 minifigures but no bike.
Lego fans could suggest improvements to the initial prototypes such as adding color to the roof (which was originally gray) and translucent elements to the hotel sign.
Market Street.
Market Street (set number: 10190) was the second of the Modular Buildings series and designed by Dutch Lego fan Eric Brok. It was originally released as a follow-up to Café Corner in 2007. The set contains 1248 pieces and is recommended for builders 10 years of age or older. The set features include opening doors and windows, a gate, a striped awning, and 3 minifigures. Advanced construction techniques used in Market Street include: curved staircases, "stripped paint" sections on the walls, interchangeable floors, Dutch/Belgian stepped roof, a basement, offset windows, and wrought iron-look decoration and gate.
Market Street is a unique set in the Modular Buildings series in that it has fewer than 2000 pieces and is recommended for builders 10 years and up rather than the usual 16. One of the reasons this set was smaller than the others was to provide a lower cost entry point into the Modular Houses series.
Market Street is the only set in the series to be released with Lego Factory branding on the box. This is because it was originally designed by a Lego fan rather than a Lego designer. Eric Brok, a Lego fan from the Netherlands, designed the set working closely with Lego designers.
Green Grocer.
Green Grocer (set number: 10185) was the third of the Modular Buildings series. It was originally released in 2008. The set contains 2352 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 years of age or older. Some of the set features include a blue and white awning, opening doors and windows, detailed interiors to each room, a roof terrace, a fire escape, access to a courtyard behind the building, and 4 minifigures. Advanced building techniques used in Green Grocer include using black skeleton legs and hammers to make railings, using black spear guns as railings for the fire escape, using a paddle for a pendulum in a grandfather clock, and using hinges to make a bay window.
Green Grocer differs from the previous two sets in the series because it has a greater level of detail inside. Whereas Café Corner and Market Street had bare interiors, each floor in Green Grocer contains a prop such as a standup radiator or some furniture such as a grandfather clock. The first floor is fully furnished as a grocery, with refrigerated shelves with opening doors and cartons of food. The assortment of Lego food pieces in the grocery includes carrots, apples and bananas. There’s also a stairway to the apartment above, and a mailbox set with letters.
Fire Brigade.
Released in September 2009, Fire Brigade (set number: 10197) was the fourth set in the Modular Buildings series. The set contains 2231 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 years of age or older. Modeled to look like a realistic 1930s fire station, the set includes a bell tower, an opening garage door, a '30s style fire truck, and 4 minifigures with a fire-dog. Like Green Grocer, all floors in the Fire Brigade set are fully furnished. The Fire Brigade is the first Modular House to come with a vehicle, the '30s style fire truck. The set also includes some new, unique pieces, such as gold fire helmets and a red sliding garage door.
New building techniques introduced with this set include a systematic way of building numbers. On the front of the building the year 1932 appears, which is a reference to when Lego was founded. The number 3 also appears on the pavement of the set representing that this is the 3rd set on the series from Lego set designer Jamie Berard (he had previously designed Café Corner and Green Grocer).
Grand Emporium.
Grand Emporium (set number: 10211), released in March 2010, is the fifth set in the Modular Buildings series. The set contains 2182 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 years of age or older. Modeled to look like a realistic early 20th Century department store, the set includes a realistic exterior with an ice cream stand, store window displays, window washer platform, and rooftop billboard. Interior details include an escalator, dressing rooms, and a wide assortment of "merchandise." It is built as a corner, similarly to Café Corner and Palace Cinema. There are 7 minifigures, including some that are made to look like mannequins.
Pet Shop.
Pet Shop (set number: 10218), released in May 2011, is the sixth set in the Modular Buildings series. The set contains 2032 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 years of age or older. It is the first set in the series that is actually made out of 2 buildings that separate using the same Technic pins that link the rest of the modulars together. They can be reversed or separated and wrapped around another building. The brown building is a town house and the sand blue building is the Pet Shop. The brown building is the only building, with the exception of Market Street, that has a basement. There is a special feature on the Pet Shop on the ground floor, where the staircase can be folded away for more access room for playing (This was an issue with Market Street). There are 4 minifigures, 2 parrots and a fish tank with goldfish. The set also includes 3 dog bones, a ball, a frog toy, a birdhouse, a bucket and a brush. This is also the smallest set by height and stands at just over 25 cm. The next tallest modular is Market Street at 33 cm. The set includes a full interior including a toilet, bed, kitchen and fireplace.
Town Hall.
Town Hall (set number: 10224) was released in March 2012 and is the seventh set in the Modular Building line. The set contains 2766 pieces and is recommended for builder 14 and over. It is the largest modular set, taking the title from the Green Grocer. It contains many interior details, such as a working elevator, along with board tables and balconies to look to the floor below. Along with the interior details the set also has many exterior details, such as four pillars on the front step and windows at the back of the building, and also a clock tower at the top of the building. The date on the building, 1891 represents the birth year of the founder of Lego and when reversed, it's the birth year of the designer, Astrid (1981). The set is priced at £149.99, $199.99 or €179.99 as released by LEGO on February 16, 2012. There are eight minifigures in the set with a wedding couple.
Palace Cinema.
Palace Cinema (set number: 10232) was released in March 2013, and is the eighth set in the Modular Building line and the third corner building. The set contains 2194 pieces and has two floors. So far, Palace Cinema is the only Modular Building set to be released with the Lego Creator branding on its box and include stickers. Also, Palace Cinema is the second Modular Building set to have two floors, instead of the usual 3, and include a vehicle, a black 1930s car.
Parisian Restaurant.
Parisian Restaurant (set number: 10243) is the ninth set in the Modular Building line and was released in January 2014. The set contains 2469 pieces and has three floors, featuring a ground floor restaurant, an apartment, and an art studio.
Related Set.
Mini Modulars.
Lego Designer Jamie created one of the Modular Buildings and decided to make a mini version of his set for fun. Five of these were then released as a single set 10230 containing 1356 pieces. Initially this set was for Lego's VIPs only, but the set later became available for general sale.
Challenges.
A challenge faced by the designers of these sets is that they are not able to work with the full palette of Lego bricks and colors ever produced when designing. Instead they are limited to the bricks and colors currently in production by Lego at the time of the product design. As an example, for Café Corner, the designer wanted to include a bicycle piece in the set, but at the time, the machine that made bicycle pieces was broken. It had to be fixed in order for the designer to be able to include the piece in his design. With Market Street, the fan designer was limited to only the bricks and color combinations available as 'active components,' meaning bricks that were already in production. No new bricks could be introduced.
There have been scheduling challenges faced in the design of the Modular Houses sets. For the Green Grocer set, the designer believed that the set could have benefited from another design iteration before release. The detailed nature of these sets requires a greater amount of design time than a normal Lego set. It is expected that future sets in the series will not suffer from such schedule pressures.
During the design of Café Corner (and presumably with the other sets in the series), the designer had to work closely with the building instructions team due to some of the "unorthodox techniques" that he used "which have not been tried before in official Lego sets." 
The reason interiors were not included in the first two models in the series, Café Corner and Market Street, was because they could not be seen in the pictures included on the packaging. Once the success of Modular Buildings sets had been proven with these first two sets, for the third set, Green Grocer, the designer was allowed to include interior details in each of the floors. As a result, many of the interior details of later sets, such Green Grocer, are not visible on the box and are only discovered while building the set. However, the boxes of each set feature some of the interior details such as the escalators inside Grand Emporium.
Reception.
The Modular Buildings series is viewed by Lego designers and fan sites as "toys for adults". Product reviews have been very positive with the biggest criticisms being price and degree of difficulty. With Café Corner, one reviewer complained that the interior of the building was bare of any finishing. This complaint was addressed in later models such as Green Grocer, which had finished interior details included in each of its three floors.
When the first set in the series, Café Corner, was released, the designer indicated that more sets would follow in the series only if sales of the first set were successful. In a later interview in 2008 covering the third set in the series, Green Grocer, the designer indicated that sales had been strong enough to support four sets in the series so far (referring to the planned 2009 release of Fire Brigade as the fourth set).

Manx surnames

Manx surnames are surnames which originate on the Isle of Man. These reflect the recorded history of the island which can be divided into three different eras - Gaelic, Norse, and English. In consequence most Manx surnames are derived from the Gaelic, Norse or English languages.
Origins and sources.
During the first period of recorded history the island was occupied by Celtic speaking peoples and later Christianised by Irish missionaries. 
By the 9th century Vikings, generally from Norway, ruled the island: Old Norse speaking settlers intermarried with the Gaelic speaking native population, and Norse personal names found their way into common Manx usage.
By the 13th century the island became a Scottish possession, but passed back and forth between Scotland and England for a hundred years before finally coming under British rule, resulting in open immigration from the mainland.
Under the English many surnames introduced to the island were translated into Manx, while many indigenous Manx surnames became Anglicised. Immigration from Ireland brought Hiberno-Norman surnames to the island as well.
Very few Manx surnames are recorded prior to the arrival of the Stanleys in 1405. The majority of early surnames are recorded in the Manorial Rolls dating from 1510-1513. More recent sources of surnames are Parish records from the beginning of the 17th century.
Arthur William Moore analysed the origin of Manx surnames in use at the beginning of the 19th century: of 170 surnames, about 100 (65 percent) are of Celtic origin while about 30 (17.5 percent) were of Norse-Gaelic origin.
Patronymics and the loss of the prefix "Mac".
Patronymic names were formed by the use of the Gaelic prefix "Mac" to the father's name. The "Irish" O (Ó) never took root among Manx names.
By the early 16th century, the "Mac" prefix was almost universally used on the island; but, by the 17th century, it had almost completely disappeared. The pronunciation of the prefix "Mac" was unstressed, so that the final consonant became first consonant in the second element of the name (the father's personal name). When the Mac prefix fell out of use, the final consonant became the first sound of the surname. Because of this, many Manx names characteristically begin with the letters "C," "K", or "Q".
Patronymic forms of personal names beginning with element "Giolla" "servant of" (for instance, MacGillchrist) underwent a transformation of their own; the prefix "Mac" and the element "Giolla" were contracted into "Myley". For example, MacGillchrist became "Mylechreest" or "Mylchreest".
Matrilineal "Ine".
Prior to the mid-17th century there were many instances of female surnames using the prefix "Ine", a Gaelic contraction meaning "daughter," cognate to the Irish prefixes "Ní " and "Nic" and Scottish Gaelic "Nic", derived from "iníon " "daughter". From the mid-17th century onwards the prefix generally fell out of use, though "Inney" survived as a Christian name for a century afterwards. According to J. J. Kneen, there are several instances of feminine surnames using Ine as late as the early 19th century.

Church of St. John the Baptist, Newport

The Church of St. John the Baptist, Newport is a parish church in the Church of England located in Newport, Isle of Wight. It is a Grade II listed building, the only surviving building by the British architect Robert Gunter Wetten (1804–1868).
History.
Construction started in 1835. The building, at the junction of St. John's Road and Terrace Road, was complete by 1837. It cost £3,600 and had 830 seats.
It was consecrated on 4 April 1837 by Charles Sumner, Bishop of Winchester.
Originally it was a daughter church within the Parish of Carisbrooke, and known as St John's Church, Carisbrooke. It became a parish church in its own right in 1896, by order of the Privy Council. It is now part of a joint parish with Sts Thomas Minster.
Organ.
An organ was provided when the church opened in 1837, which was later replaced by a pipe organ by Bryceson Brothers dating from 1890. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

The car uses an improved KIA Pride platform, but its safety is relatively unknown, as the producing company (Saipa) has not had the car tested by a 3rd-party or crash tested it by itself. In its production the services of some 122 local manufacturers have been utilized and about 810 parts have been produced.
A new subsidiary, Kashan Saipa will take up production of the car. The share of Tiba in Saipa’s exports is expected to be around 20 percent by 2011.
Technical Specifications.
Along with being built on a modified KIA Pride's platform, the Tiba is also powered by KIA Pride's 4-cylinder 80 hp 1497cc engine and 5-speed manual transmission, which were both modified in size and power by the German FEV company, with a fuel economy of 42MPG (5.6L/100 km) in highways and 33MPG in the cities. (7.2L/100 km) The car is also relatively well-equipped, with a CD Player, anti-theft technology, customizable seat position and front light angle, and automatic front windows.
The car's safety features are weak, however, as only a single driver's airbag and an ABS have been installed on base-models. Despite this fact, another airbag for the passenger, along with other accessories such as automatic rear windows, auto-climate control, aluminium rims, and a remote control can optionally be ordered during purchase.
Tiba 211 (Hatchback).
Recently unveiled in a ceremony hosted and organized by Saipa, it is the hatchback version of Saipa Tiba. It can be expected that the hatchback will be fitted with the same engine as its sedan counterpart.
Although no price has yet been specified, Saipa has suggested that the car will be available for sale in the near future.

1980 Australian Touring Car Championship

The 1980 Australian Touring Car Championship was the 21st running of the Australian Touring Car Championship.
Peter Brock won his third and final ATCC title, driving a Holden VB Commodore for the Holden Dealer Team. Brock and the HDT had been testing a VB Commodore in late 1979 in readiness for the rule changes enforced by CAMS. These rule changes aimed at reducing engine emissions (mostly sparked by the 1970s oil crisis) effectively made the Torana's and Falcons of the previous years ineligible. By the start of the ATCC, Brock and the HDT were the only team anywhere near ready to race, and it showed in the results. Brock won four of the eight rounds, including the opening three rounds. He also put his Commodore on pole position at each round of the championship.
Former tiwce CAMS Gold Star champion and 1974 Hardie-Ferodo 1000 winner Kevin Bartlett recovered from his 1979 Formula 5000 crash and finished second in the championship in his Channel 9 sponsored Chevrolet Camaro Z28 (financed by Nine's owner Kerry Packer). Bartlett broke Brock's winning run, using the Camaro's superior power to win at Sandown, and would later win the penultimate round in Adelaide. Sydney based Toyota dealer Peter Williamson finished third in the championship in his Class B Toyota Celica, benefiting from class wins and generally poor or small fields (especially in the outright Class A) resulting from teams rushing to get the new generation cars race ready.
Reigning champion Bob Morris had lost his major sponsor when Ron Hodgson had pulled out at the end of 1979, so Morris entered into an uneasy relationship with Allan Grice's Craven Mild Racing. Grice drove one of the 1979 Torana's (with drum brakes at the rear as well as the required "low emission" heads) to victory at Wanneroo in Perth. Grice only competed in four rounds and finished eighth in the title. Morris endured an unhappy championship in the teams Commodore and could only finish fifth on points, though he did win the final round at Oran Park Raceway.
After Ford Australia pulled out of racing at the end of 1978, and being forced to go it alone as a privateer in 1979, the 1980 ATCC was the first time since 1968 that triple champion Allan Moffat did not contest the championship.
Teams and drivers.
The following drivers and teams competed in the 1980 Australian Touring Car Championship.
Results and Standings.
Race Calendar.
The 1980 Australian Touring Car Championship consisted of eight rounds. The series consisted of eight rounds several of which were held with two heats, others with a single race per round.

Pulpit of Sant' Andrea, Pistoia (Giovanni Pisano)

The pulpit in the church of Sant' Andrea, Pistoia is a masterpiece of 1301 by the Italian sculptor Giovanni Pisano, in the "pieve" of Sant'Andrea, Pistoia, Italy.
The work is often compared to the pulpits sculpted by Giovanni's father Nicola Pisano in the Baptistery of Pisa and the Duomo of Siena, which Giovanni had assisted with. These very advanced works are often described in terms such as "proto-Renaissance", and draw on Ancient Roman sarcophagi and other influences to form a style that represents an early revival of classical sculpture, while also remaining Gothic, and drawing on sources such as French ivory carvings.
History.
According to an inscription running between the pulpit's arcades and parapets, it was commissioned by Canon Arnoldus (Arnoldo) and supervised by the treasurers Andrea Vitelli and Tino di Vitale. Vasari says the commission was given in 1297, and the inscription records its completion in 1301. There is no false modesty: "
Giovanni carved it, who performed no empty work. The son of Nicola, and blessed with higher skill, Pisa gave him birth, endowed with mastery greater than any seen before".
Giovanni was approaching the age of fifty when he began the work, and had worked on his father's projects, and possibly visited France.
Description.
The structure is similar to the pulpit in Pisa: a hexagonal plan with seven columns (one in the middle), two of which are supported by lions and one by a stooping figure of Atlas, while the central one rests on three winged gryphons and the remaining ones on plain bases. The organization of the parapet's reliefs is inspired by the pulpit in Siena.
The iconographic program is also inspired by Nicola's work, with "Allegories" in the pendentives of the arches, "Sibyls" and "Prophets standing on the capitals' tops, and the five parapets with the following scenes from the "Life of Christ":
The sixth parapet is missing, as its side provides access to the pulpit; the original stairway has now been removed.
Style.
The scenes are as crowded and dramatic as those of the Sienese pulpit. Most notable is the scene of the "Massacre of the Innocents", for which it has been supposed that Giovanni took inspiration from German models, or even from the Trajan column in Rome. One of the Sibyls, portrayed in the sudden gesture of fleeing towards an angel, is also of particular distinction. For the first time Pisano tilted the reliefs, with the upper parts projecting further than the lower, to allow for the position of the viewer below.

The Church of St. John the Baptist, Niton is a Church of England parish church in Niton, Isle of Wight.
History.
The church was founded by William FitzOsbern and given to an abbey in Normandy. In the Victorian era it was extensively restored and rebuilt.
The nave may be 11th century, as may be the Norman font. A north aisle was added at the end of the 12th century and a south aisle shortly afterwards. In the 14th century the chancel was rebuilt and the south porch was added. In the 15th century a chapel was added south of the chancel and east of the south aisle, and a four-centred arch was inserted in the south wall of the chancel to link it with the chapel. The north aisle was demolished, its arcade filled in and two-light Perpendicular Gothic windows inserted in each of the filled-in arches. The Perpendicular Gothic west tower was added towards the end of the 15th century. The square-headed windows in the south aisle were inserted in the 16th century and the spire was added to the tower probably early in the 17th century.
On the wall can be found a memorial portrait by John Flaxman, showing a woman holding pelicans in her hand in relief. The chancel has a modern reredos.
The registers, which date from 1560, include the following entry:
In front of the porch is a 19th-century Celtic cross by Joseph Clarke on the four steps of the old churchyard cross.
Near the Celtic cross a marble monument marks the grave of Edward Edwards, (1812–1886) the pioneer of the public library movement.

Pertica

Pertica is a genus of extinct vascular plants of the Early to Middle Devonian (around ). It has been placed in the "trimerophytes", a strongly paraphyletic group of early members of the lineage leading to modern ferns and seed plants.
Description.
"Pertica quadrifaria" (the type species of the genus) was described in 1972 from compression fossils found in the Trout Valley Formation of northern Maine, USA. It was an upright plant which grew to perhaps as much as a metre (3 ft) in height. It comprised a main, straight stem (axis) with side branches which developed dichotomously, branching many times at increasingly shorter intervals. Some of the terminal branchlets bore masses of erect paired, ellipsoidal sporangia in distinctive tight clusters. The branches were arranged in a spiral pattern, forming four vertical rows. The specific epithet "quadrifaria" refers to this growth habit.
"Pertica varia" was described in 1976 from the Devonian of Eastern Canada. It was considerably taller than "P. quadrifaria", reaching a height of nearly 3 m. The sporangia were similar to those of "P. quadrifaria", although there were fewer in each cluster.
"Pertica dalhousii" was described in 1978 from fossils of Early or Middle Devonian age found in New Brunswick, Canada. The plant appears to have been similar to "P. quadrifaria" (only part is known), comprising a central stem (axis) with spirally arranged dichotomous side branches, some of which terminated in erect clusters of between 32 and 128 sporangia. Further specimens from the same rocks possibly belonged to another species of "Pertica", but were not sufficiently well preserved to be named.
Phylogeny.
The clear differentiation between a main stem (axis) and lateral branches in "Pertica", as in other "trimerophytes", has been considered to represent an early stage in the development of a growth pattern that later led to the evolution of megaphylls (large true leaves). Consistent with this, a cladogram published in 2004 by Crane et al. places "Pertica" in a paraphyletic stem group basal to the seed plants (spermatophytes) which have such leaves.
Other researchers have produced rather different analyses. Rothwell's analysis separates "trimerophytes", like "Pertica", from progymnosperms, like "Tetraxylopteris", with only the latter being closely related to seed plants.

Terlinguachelys

Terlinguachelys fischbecki is an extinct sea turtle that existed during the Late Cretaceous period some 80 million years ago. It is the sole species in the genus Terlinguachelys and is classified in the family Protostegidae along with other extinct marine turtles.
As an early sea turtle, "Terlinguachelys" already showed several characteristics typical of modern sea turtles. These included a dorsoventrally-flattened body, a comparatively large head with a short neck and the iconic flattened paddle-like arms that sea turtles distinctly possess. However, some anatomical differences identify the turtle as a more basal member of the sea turtle superfamily. The posterior portion of "Terlinguachelys"' mandible for example has several elements that are reduced in later forms. Whereas the posterior portions of modern sea turtles' mandibles are smoother and streamlined, that of "Terlinguachelys" has prominent fossae. The plates that comprise the carapace of the lone specimen exhumed were analyzed and somewhat indicated that they were not completely ossified, suggesting that this taxon is closer in relation to the leatherbacks rather than other modern marine turtles. Also, this particular species has a comparatively longer femur in proportion to its humerus than other species of marine turtle, extant and otherwise.
The species was discovered in 1987. A lone specimen was unearthed from rocks located in the Aguja Formation of Texas, dated to be from Campanian deposits of the Late Cretaceous period. The type specimen, labeled as TMM 43072-1, consists of an incomplete turtle skeleton including parts of the skull, carapace and limbs.
The turtle was named for the nearby town of Terlingua, Texas, just kilometers away from where the specimen was discovered. Roughly translated, "Terlinguachelys fischbecki" means "Fischbeck's turtle from Terlingua". The species itself was named in honor of a local teacher, George R. Fischbeck who was popular in the 1960s.

Siege of Srebrenica

The Siege of Srebrenica (, ) was a three-year-long siege of the town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina which lasted from April 1992 to July 1995 during the Bosnian War. Initially assaulted by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and the Serbian Volunteer Guard (SDG), the town was encircled by the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) in May 1992, starting a brutal siege which was to last for the majority of the Bosnian War. In June 1995, the commander of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) in the enclave, Naser Orić, left Srebrenica and fled to the town of Tuzla. He was subsequently replaced by his deputy, Major Ramiz Bećirović.
In July 1995, Srebrenica fell to the combined forces of the Republika Srpska and numerous paramilitary formations which included hundreds of Greek and Russian volunteers in what was codenamed Operation Krivaja '95. The subsequent massacre of the town's male population led to the deaths of more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys, and is considered the largest act of mass murder in Europe since the end of World War II. It was judged to have been a crime of genocide by international criminal courts. As a result, VRS General Radislav Krstić was found by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) of murder, persecution and aiding and abetting genocide, while VRS General Zdravko Tolimir was also convicted of genocide. Both men were sentenced to life imprisonment. One of the indictments against Ratko Mladić, the commander of the VRS during the war, is for the massacre in Srebrenica. The commander of Bosniak forces in the enclave, Naser Orić, was found guilty of failing to prevent the mistreatment of VRS prisoners held in Srebrenica between September 1992 and March 1993. However, his conviction was overturned in 2008.
Background.
Srebrenica is a small mining town in eastern Bosnia about fifteen kilometers from the Serbian border. According to a census held in 1991, 36,000 people lived in the municipality of Srebrenica, including 25,000 Bosnian Muslims (or Bosniaks) and 8,500 Serbs. This figure shows that about 75 percent of the municipal population was Bosniak and about 25 percent was Serb. The town of Srebrenica itself was inhabited by 9,000 people when Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. That January, a Bosnian Serb state was declared, ahead of the 29 February–1 March referendum on independence. Later renamed the Republika Srpska, it developed its own military as the JNA withdrew from Croatia and handed over its weapons, equipment and 55,000 troops to the newly created Bosnian Serb army. By 1 March, Bosnian Serb forces set up barricades in Sarajevo and elsewhere and later that month Bosnian Serb artillery began shelling the town of Bosanski Brod. By 4 April, Sarajevo was shelled. In May 1992, the ground forces of Bosnian Serb state officially became known as the Army of Republika Srpska (, VRS). By the end of 1992, the VRS held seventy percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
At the outbreak of the war, eastern Bosnia, a Bosniak-majority territory before the war, was subjected to ethnic cleansing operations and numerous atrocities involving murder, rape on a massive scale, plundering, and forced relocation by Serb forces and paramilitary gangs. Taking place throughout the municipalities of Srebrenica, Vlasenica, Rogatica, Bratunac, Višegrad, Zvornik and Foča, the purpose of these operations was to create in eastern Bosnia a contiguous Serb-controlled land having a common border with Serbia. Located in the heart of what Bosnian Serbs considered their territory, Srebrenica was seized by the paramilitary Serbian Volunteer Guard (, or SDG) on 18 April 1992. According to a witness, "organized killings of the Muslim population began" on 21 April. On 6 May, a two-day battle between Serb and Muslim forces erupted in the town. Naser Orić, a one-time member of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs and former bodyguard of Serbian President Slobodan Milošević, then assumed control of Srebrenica after helping local Bosniak forces drive the SDG and other Serb paramilitary units from the town by 8 May. Goran Zekić, the leader of the Serb population in the municipality, was killed in the fighting. In June, the Muslim population of Srebrenica established a local "war council". By December 1992, they had managed to gain control of up to 95 percent of the Srebrenica municipality and half of the neighbouring Bratunac municipality. By this time, Orić's forces had established a sixty-kilometer-long Bosniak enclave which stretched from Žepa in the south to the village of Kamenica in the north, however only to be surrounded and in dire need of food by February 1993 while the population of the enclave grew to almost 40,000 as refugees from the surrounding ethnically cleansed towns and villages sought refuge in the town. Indeed, most of the enclave's residents were not originally from Srebrenica, but from all around eastern Bosnia or Podrinje.
Siege.
In the words of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY):
In his ICTY testimony, VRS Intelligence Chief Momir Nikolić recounted how Bosnian Serb forces were instructed to make life in Srebrenica unbearable in order to induce its civilian population to "leave "en masse" as soon as possible, realizing they cannot survive there." As part of this, Nikolić conceded that civilians were targeted and humanitarian aid blocked while fuel, food and other supplies for UN peacekeepers were halted so that "they could not be ready for combat".
While the Bosnian Serbs enjoyed military superiority, they were outnumbered by the Bosniaks who adopted a type of guerrilla warfare, which in the second half of 1992 and up to early 1993 was quite successful. In an attempt to press outward, Orić and his men conducted a series of raids against outlying Serb villages, or from which Bosniaks had formerly been expelled, ostensibly to seize food, weapons, ammunition and military equipment, but also to exact punishment on the local Serb population for the VRS's harassment of the enclave. During these events, Bosniak forces committed apparent violations of humanitarian law against the Bosnian Serb inhabitants, especially from May 1992 to January 1993. The most notable of these violations occurred on 7 January 1993, when Orić's men attacked the Serb village of Kravica, which bordered the Srebrenica enclave. Forty-three Serbs were killed in the attack, including 13 civilians. Orić's forces destroyed many of the villages that fell into their hands during the Bosnian Serb siege–killing perhaps 1,000 Serb soldiers and civilians–and shelled the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the eastern bank of the Drina River. In February 1993, the conflict over Srebrenica became so intense that a Srebrenica delegation visiting Sarajevo proposed that one Sarajevan Serb be killed for every Bosniak killed in Srebrenica. At this time, the Srebrenica enclave had reached its peak size of 900 square kilometers, although it was never linked to the main area of Bosnian-held land in the west and remained "a vulnerable island amid Serb-controlled territory." In response, the VRS launched numerous operations against the town. In March 1993, General Ratko Mladić of the VRS ordered the Bosnian Serb forces besieging the town to launch a large-scale counterattack. The attack resulted in the Bosnian Serbs capturing 80 percent of the territory of the Srebrenica enclave once held by the 28th Division of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). However, the VRS was forced to stop its offensive after the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 819, which called for talks between the Bosniak and Bosnian Serb military leadership and the de-militarization of Srebrenica which was declared a "safe-area". However, because of differing interpretations of the resolution, Srebrenica was never disarmed. Instead, it was surrounded by a force of approximately 2,000 men from the VRS Drina Corps, which continued its stranglehold of the enclave.
The VRS shelled Srebrenica on 12 April 1993, killing at least 56 people and wounding 73. Within weeks, the town's population swelled from 9,000 to 40,000 as Bosniak refugees fled from the surrounding countryside. However, neither this counterattack nor the United Nation's designation of the town as a "safe area" ended Orić's raids against neighbouring Serb villages, which persisted at a rate of 3–4 per week as Bosniak forces searched for food to steal from the surrounding countryside. As a result, the VRS warned the UN peacekeeping units in Srebrenica that Bosnian Serb forces would retaliate against the town's civilian population if Bosniak forces continued attacking Serb villages. The situation in Srebrenica subsequently worsened, with the refugees and townspeople running out of food and water. Despite this, the VRS only occasionally permitted humanitarian aid to the besieged town. In one instance, the VRS permitted the evacuation of about 5,000 Bosniak women and children from Srebrenica. During these evacuations, six children were crushed to death while clambering to board a bus destined for Tuzla. Afterwards, the VRS made an offer that would allow the UN to send in any number of trucks and buses into the enclave to evacuate its Bosniak population. However, this offer was rejected by many in the United Nations, the United States and the Bosnian government, who claimed that arranging an evacuation would "assist the process of ethnic cleansing." 
In 1994, the Canadian peacekeeping battalion (CANBAT) in Srebrenica was replaced by a battalion of Dutch peacekeepers (DUTCHBAT). With the VRS outnumbered and overextended countrywide in the winter of 1994, Mladić reasoned that it would be necessary to consolidate Bosnian Serb forces by eliminating one or more of the UN "safe areas" and the ARBiH garrisons located within them. Although attacking them would violate UN resolutions, Mladić believed that international forces would not confront the VRS as long as UNPROFOR units were vulnerable to suffering heavy casualties and hostage takings. A subsequent hostage crisis in which UN personnel were seized and used as human shields to prevent NATO airstrikes destroyed the credibility of UN deterrence in Bihać and Sarajevo. Mladić then turned his attention to Srebrenica, Goražde and Žepa, whose seizure would release considerable VRS forces for redeployment against an expected Croatian Army–ARBiH offensive in western Bosnia, while strengthening the Bosnian Serb claim to the entire Drina valley in case of a future peace settlement. Due their location, Srebrenica and Žepa were the most vulnerable of the UN "safe areas" in Bosnia, in stark contrast to Goražde, where UN forces had resisted the VRS before being enforced by the ARBiH.
Bosniak raids from the town intensified in the beginning of 1995, with Orić's forces being ordered by the ARBiH to "reconnoiter, disrupt, divert and demoralize" VRS soldiers, who subsequently retaliated with counterattacks of their own. In March 1995, Radovan Karadžić, President of the Republika Srpska, issued Directive 7, setting out the long term strategy for VRS forces surrounding Srebrenica and Žepa. The aim of the VRS was to be to "complete the physical separation of Srebrenica from Žepa as soon as possible, preventing even communication between individuals in the two enclaves. By planned and well thought out combat operations, create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival or life for the inhabitants of Srebrenica." During this time, Orić ordered the murder of many political opponents and profited from smuggling supplies on the black market. At night, his men would break out from the enclave and participate in illicit trade with Bosnian Serb villagers and would also often loot the Serb countryside.
In the last two weeks of June, a VRS unit was ambushed twenty kilometers northwest of the Srebrenica enclave. By this time Orić had already fled to the Bosniak-held town of Tuzla, ostensibly to participate in a "command training" exercise. He was replaced by his deputy, Major Ramiz Bećirović, who had been seriously injured in a helicopter crash two months earlier and was barely able to walk. Orić's departure effectively left Srebrenica without effective leadership. Despite this, ARBiH headquarters ordered another attack against Bosnian Serb units on the Sarajevo-Zvornik road for the evening of 25–26 June. With a force of 150 men, Bosniak forces inflicted forty casualties VRS casualties and seized weapons, radios and livestock. Mladić then contacted the UN headquarters in Sarajevo and indicated that he would no longer tolerate Bosniak incursions into the Bosnian Serb countryside. Bosnian Serb forces retaliated by shelling Srebrenica, prompting the Bosniaks to respond that the VRS was again shelling a UN safe area.
Fall of Srebrenica.
Operation Krivaja '95.
Operation Krivaja '95 (, ) was the codename of a military operation launched by the VRS against formations of the ARBIH in the UN enclave of Srebrenica. Launched on 6 July 1995, the operation ended the three-year-long siege of the town and was followed by the Srebrenica massacre, which has been ruled a crime of genocide by international courts of law.
In late-June 1995, Ratko Mladić made the decision to launch an attack on Srebrenica, which evidence indicates was always part of his long-term strategy. However, the Serbs did not expect Srebrenica to be an easy conquest. With 100 members of the Greek Volunteer Guard, together with 2,000–3,000 reinforcements and 200–300 members of the Serb Volunteer Guard, the Bosnian Serbs could hardly muster 4,000–5,000 men for the offensives against Srebrenica and Žepa. Of these, it was estimated that only 2,000 would take part in the thrust to capture Srebrenica in July 1995. The Bosniaks, not as well-armed as their opponents, had a military force of 6,000 men within the town, about one-third or one-half of whom were armed. 1,500 of these were professional soldiers and 1,500 were armed militiamen. Also in the town were the 570 lightly-armed peacekeepers of the Dutch battalion (DUTCHBAT).
On 2 July, Major General Milenko Živanović, then commander of the Drina Corps of the VRS, signed two orders laying out the plans for an attack on the UN protected area at Srebrenica codenamed Krivaja '95. The objective of the operation was for the VRS to attack the enclave, and effectively eliminate it. Alongside police and paramilitary units from both the Republika Srpska and Yugoslavia, as well as Greek and Russian volunteers, the VRS began attacking various points at the southern edge of the Srebrenica enclave on 6 July. The forces of the VRS, numbering 1,500 in the initial stages of the attack, then shelled a series of Dutch observation posts in the southern portion of the enclave, forcing the Dutch peacekeepers stationed there to flee. On the other hand, the few thousand remaining Bosniak soldiers of Srebrenica offered little resistance as their best-trained units had already abandoned the town. To make matters worse, Dutch peacekeepers had confiscated their weapons. When the Bosniaks demanded that their weapons be returned to them, the Dutch refused. As a result, Bosniak troops attempted to block the Dutch withdrawal in the face of the Bosnian Serb onslaught and more than 100 Dutch soldiers were taken hostage by the Bosniaks in a desperate attempt to stop them from leaving. Subsequently, a Dutch peacekeeper was killed after a hand grenade was thrown at his APC by a Bosniak soldier. The Dutch then demanded that NATO bomb Serb positions around the town, but their requests were ignored. With virtually no Bosniak resistance, the VRS relentlessly pounded Srebrenica with artillery on 9 and 10 July. On 11 July, the VRS entered the town. As it did, Mladić had about thirty Dutch soldiers taken hostage. About 3,000-4,000 Bosniak civilians then fled to the UN compound in Potočari where all men between fourteen and seventy were segregated by the VRS, the great bulk of which were trucked to neighboring Serb-held Bratunac. DutchBat personnel who attempted to follow them were seized by the VRS, together with their UN vehicles and some uniforms, weapons and other equipment. Whereas Mladić had expected the ARBiH 28th Division to regroup near Potočari, the men of this division chose instead to flee to Bosnian-held territory. On 12 July the Serbs learned that the majority of the town's men had indeed fled the enclave, with 700–900 fleeing east to Serbia, 300–850 fleeing south to Žepa, and 10,000–15,000 fleeing north to Tuzla. Of these 10,000–15,000, approximately 6,000 were fleeing Bosniak soldiers, of whom 1,000–1,500 were armed. By the time the VRS had been redeployed, about 3,000 soldiers of the column's better-armed vanguard had successfully escaped to Tuzla. The 9,000–12,000 Bosniaks who remained were encircled by VRS units and attacked by artillery, armor and small arms fire. The relatively few who survived the experience recounted how many panic-stricken Bosniak men committed suicide, killed each other in the dark, or drowned while attempting to cross the Jadar river, but by far the greatest portion of the men surrendered, some unwittingly to VRS soldiers equipped with stolen UN vehicles, helmets and uniforms.
At midday on 11 July, NATO planes arrived from Italy and struck a Bosnian Serb tank, before being forced to cease operations after General Mladić threatened to "destroy" both the Dutch soldiers and the Bosniak population of Srebrenica unless airstrikes were called off. That afternoon, Mladić, accompanied by General Živanović (then Commander of the Drina Corps), General Krstić (then Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff of the Drina Corps) and other Bosnian Serb officers, took a triumphant walk through the deserted streets of the town of Srebrenica. The moment was captured on film by Serbian journalist Zoran Petrović. Mladić posed for television cameras, before declaring that Srebrenica had been "returned forever to the Serbs." Later, Thom Karremans, the commander of the Dutch troops in the town, drank a toast with Mladić which was filmed for Serb television. Off-camera, however, Mladić warned Karremans that the UN compound in Potočari, where thousands of Bosniak refugees had gathered, would be shelled by the VRS if NATO planes reappeared.
Aftermath.
Srebrenica massacre.
On 12 July, buses began arriving to take Bosniak women and children to Bosniak-held territory while Dutch troops helped Bosnian Serb forces in separating all men from the ages of 14 to 70. Some of the men were killed or beaten on the spot, while women were raped.
The fall of the town was followed by a massacre of prisoners taken by the VRS forces and civilian refugees who had been handed over to the VRS by Dutchbat troops after they had sought shelter on the Dutchbat base at Potočari. The ICTY Trial Chamber was satisfied that the total number executed was likely to have been within the range of 7,000 to 8,000. The bodies were disposed of in unmarked mass graves which were subsequently reopened and the contents mingled and relocated. The killings and their concealment, carried out in an organised and systematic manner, were subsequently confirmed by the ICTY to have been a crime of genocide pursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.
For example, on 14 July 1995, prisoners from Bratunac were bussed northward to a school in the village of Pilica, north of Zvornik. As at other detention facilities, there was no food or water and several men died in the school gym from heat and dehydration. The men were held at the Pilica school for two nights. On 16 July 1995, following a now familiar pattern, the men were called out of the school and loaded onto buses with their hands tied behind their backs. They were then driven to the Branjevo Military Farm, where groups of 10 were lined up and shot systematically.
One of the survivors recalled:
Dražen Erdemović — who confessed to killing at least 70 Bosniaks — was a member of the VRS 10th Sabotage Detachment (a Main Staff subordinate unit) and participated in the mass execution. Erdemović appeared as a prosecution witness and testified: "The men in front of us were ordered to turn their backs. When those men turned their backs to us, we shot at them. We were given orders to shoot."
Erdemović said that all but one of the victims wore civilian clothes and that, except for one person who tried to escape, they offered no resistance before being shot. Sometimes the executioners were particularly cruel. When some of the soldiers recognised acquaintances from Srebrenica, they beat and humiliated them before killing them. Erdemović had to persuade his fellow soldiers to stop using a machine gun for the killings; while it mortally wounded the prisoners it did not cause death immediately and prolonged their suffering. Between 1,000 and 1,200 men were killed in the course of that day at this execution site. Aerial photographs, taken on 17 July 1995, of an area around the Branjevo Military Farm, show a large number of bodies lying in the field near the farm, as well as traces of the excavator that collected the bodies from the field. Erdemović testified that, at around 15:00 hours on 16 July 1995, after he and his fellow soldiers from the 10th Sabotage Detachment had finished executing the prisoners at the Branjevo Military Farm, they were told that there was a group of 500 Bosniak prisoners from Srebrenica trying to break out of a nearby Dom Kultura club. Erdemović and the other members of his unit refused to carry out any more killings. They were then told to attend a meeting with a Lieutenant Colonel at a café in Pilica. Erdemović and his fellow-soldiers travelled to the café as requested and, as they waited, they could hear shots and grenades being detonated. The sounds lasted for approximately 15–20 minutes after which a soldier from Bratunac entered the café to inform those present that "everything was over".
There were no survivors to explain exactly what had happened in the Dom Kultura. Over a year later, it was still possible to find physical evidence of this atrocity. As in Kravica, many traces of blood, hair and body tissue were found in the building, with cartridges and shells littered throughout the two storeys. It could also be established that explosives and machine guns had been used. Human remains and personal possessions were found under the stage, where blood had dripped down through the floorboards.
Čančari Road 12 was the site of the re-interment of at least 174 bodies, moved here from the mass grave at the Branjevo Military Farm. Only 43 were complete sets of remains, most of which established that death had taken place as there result of rifle fire. Of the 313 various body parts found, 145 displayed gunshot wounds of a severity likely to prove fatal.
Casualties.
After the Bosnian War, the Bosnian Book of the Dead documented 9,377 violent deaths amongst combatants and civilians of all ethnicities that occurred in the Srebrenica municipality from 1992 to 1995. Most estimates put the number of Bosniak men and boys killed in the July 1995 massacre at 7,000–8,000; the list of Bosniaks killed during this period compiled by the Bosnian Federal Commission of Missing Persons contains 8,373 names. In 2003, Serbs comprised 95 percent of the population of the Srebrenica municipality.
Indictments and trials.
At his trial, VRS General Radislav Krstić was found by the ICTY to have been the person primarily directing Krivaja '95 from 6 July onward, at least until the arrival of Ratko Mladić on 9 July. The ICTY determined that the initial objective of Krivaja '95 had been to "reduce the United Nations-protected safe area of Srebrenica to its urban core" as a step towards "the larger VRS goal of plunging the Bosniak population into a humanitarian crisis and, ultimately, eliminating the enclave", and that after the surrounding area had fallen the VRS forces were then ordered to take the town itself. The ICTY found Krstić guilty of participating in two criminal plans, initially to ethnically cleanse the Srebrenica enclave of all Bosniak civilians and later to kill the military-aged men of Srebrenica. He was found guilty of murder, persecutions and aiding and abetting genocide.
On 31 May 2007, Zdravko Tolimir, a long-time fugitive and a former general in the VRS indicted by the Prosecutor of the ICTY on genocide charges relating to Srebrenica was arrested. On 12 December 2012, Tolimir was convicted of genocide and sentenced to life imprisonment.
In May 2011, VRS General Ratko Mladić was arrested in an village in northern Serbia by three special units of the Serbian security forces. The next year, his trial began before the ICTY in The Hague on charges relating to his participation as VRS commander in the criminal conspiracy to perpetrate the Srebrenica genocide.
Bosniak commander Naser Orić was arrested by SFOR in April 2003, and handed over to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), who indicted him for the "murder and cruel treatment" of Bosnian Serb prisoners, as well as burning and plundering about fifty Serb villages from 1992 to 1995. In 2006, Orić was found guilty of failing to prevent the mistreatment of VRS prisoners held in Srebrenica between September 1992 and March 1993. But the former Bosniak military commander was acquitted of all other charges, including direct involvement in the killings and responsibility for the "wanton destruction" of Serb homes and property as the ICTY could not establish that Orić himself exercised sufficient control over the raids to justify convicting him of command responsibility for the atrocities. He was sentenced to two years in jail, but was freed immediately as he had already spent three years behind bars. Orić's two-year conviction was also subsequently overturned in July 2008 by the appeals chamber which ruled that "the legal requirements to prove Orić's criminal responsibility had not been met."

Dala (game)

Dala is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Sudan, and played especially by the Baggara tribes. The game is also called Herding the Cows (or Herding the Bulls). It is an alignment game with captures similar to that of the game Dara. Players first drop their pieces onto the board, and then move them (herding the cows) orthogonally in an attempt to form 3 in-a-rows which allows a player to capture any of their opponent's piece on the board. 
Goal.
The player who reduces their opponent's number of pieces to two is the winner. The opponent can no longer form a 3-in-a-row with two pieces or fewer.
Equipment.
A 6x6 square board is used. Each player has a set of 12 pieces of which one set is black, and the other is white. 
Traditionally, the board was played on a raised soft mud, and the lines of the board were drawn onto it and marked by holes called "Nugar". Each player had 12 sharpened sticks that would be placed into the holes during play. To differentiate the sticks, the bark was removed on one set of the sticks, while the other set would retain its bark.
Game Play and Rules.
1. Players decide who will play the black and white pieces, and who will start first.
2. A 3 in-a-row is defined as exactly three pieces of the same color adjacent to one another in an orthogonal direction. The player who forms the 3 in-a-row is allowed to capture one of their opponent's piece from anywhere "on the board". This is known as a "ta'na". 4 in-a-rows or more are allowed to be created, but do "not" allow the player forming it to capture a piece from their opponent. The 3 in-a-row must be in an orthogonal direction, and therefore, diagonal 3 in-a-rows do not count also. 
Two or more 3 in-a-rows can be formed in a single move by a player, however, it may only allow that player to capture a single piece from their opponent. No source clearly clarifies this matter. 
3. The Drop Phase is the first stage of the game. Players alternate their turns placing each of their 12 pieces, one piece per turn, onto the board. However, the four central squares of the board must first be filled. Afterwards, players may place their pieces on any vacant square on the board. During the Drop Phase, players can form 3 in-a-rows which allows for that player to capture an enemy piece from anywhere on the board.
4. After each player has dropped their 12 pieces, the Movement Phase begins. Players alternate their turns moving one piece orthogonally onto a vacant adjacent square. The piece can form a 3 in-a-row by either moving onto a row or column of two adjacent pieces of its color, or leaving a row or column of four adjacent pieces of its color and thus leaving behind three adjacent pieces in-a-row. 
5. A special situation exist when a player has three of their pieces (that are adjacent to each other) on a row next to another row of two adjacent pieces (of the player's also) whereby one of the pieces of the former row can move back and forth between the two rows to form a 3 in-a-row on every turn, and thus capture a piece from the opponent on every turn. This situation is known as a "bull".

Koitalel Arap Samoei

Koitalel Arap Samoei (1860 – October 19, 1905) was an Orkoiyot, the supreme chief of the Nandi people of Kenya, who led the Nandi rebellion against the British colonial rule. 
Koitalel Arap Samoei followed his father Kimnyole as the Orkoiyot and was enthroned in 1885. When British colonials began building the Uganda Railway through the Nandi area, he led an eleven-year resistance movement against the railway. On October 19, 1905, he was invited by British Col. Richard Meinertzhagen under the guise of negotiating a truce, and was instead murdered along with his companions.
His son, Barsirian Arap Manyei (born 1882), was the Nandi leader from 1919 until 1922 when he was detained by the British. Barsirian was not released until 1964, making him the longest-serving political prisoner in Kenyan history.
A mausoleum has been built for Koitalel Arap Samoei in Nandi Hills, Kenya.

All Saints' Church, Ryde is a parish church in the Church of England located in Ryde, Isle of Wight. The building is a landmark of the Island, the spire being visible from many places around the Isle of Wight - and indeed from the mainland - projecting beyond the skyline. All Saints' is sometimes referred to as the "Cathedral of the Island" It is a Grade II* listed building, formally listed on 24 October 1950.
The present incumbent is Canon Graham Morris who was installed in June 2012 and who is also an Honorary Canon at Portsmouth Cathedral and Bishop Aglionby Memorial Cathedral in the Diocese of Tamale, Ghana.

The Vicar of All Saints' also bears the title 'Vicar of Ryde'.
Architecture.
The church was built between 1868 and 1872 by the architect George Gilbert Scott. The spire was an addition of 1881/82. The spire is climbed early on The Feast of the Ascension to sing an Ascension hymn.
All Saints' is listed as a 'large' church in ornate Second Pointed style, constructed of stone-rubble with ashlar dressings. There are six bay-pointed arcades with naturalistic capitals. The chancel walls were painted by Clayton and Bell. The apsed vestry - now the choir song school - was added by C Pemberton-Leach in 1891.
There are two side chapels: The Warrior Chapel in the north aisle - which is a memorial chapel - and The Chapel of The Good Shepherd in the south aisle, which was the original sacristy. The pulpit, reredos and font are all typical Scott features, The pulpit is made of Derbyshire alabaster on polished marble columns, and appeared in The Great Exhibition of 1851, winning 1st prize in its class.
The tower contains a ring of eight bells cast by Messrs Taylor and Co of Loughborough in 1866.
There are some fine examples of stained glass windows but these are mostly confined to the north aisle and sanctuary areas, the other windows having been destoyed by enemy action during WW2. The window in The Chapel of The Good Shepherd is dedicated to the memory of Samuel Poole (d 1872).
On the north east corner of the church boundary is a Calvary cross war memorial.

Image United

Image United was a 2009 planned six-issue comic book limited series published by Image Comics. Art for the series was to be done by six of the seven Image co-founders Whilce Portacio, Jim Valentino, Marc Silvestri, Rob Liefeld, Erik Larsen and Todd McFarlane, with each artist drawing the characters he created. Jim Lee, the seventh Image founder, who is now affiliated with DC Comics, is contributing covers to the series. The series was written by Image partner Robert Kirkman. As of February 2014, only three of the planned six issues had been published.
Background.
"Image United" was a crossover event featuring the characters created by the six remaining founders including Youngblood, Spawn, Savage Dragon, Shadowhawk, Witchblade, Cyberforce, and The Darkness. Whilce Portacio—whose first Image Comics series "Wetworks" is now owned by DC Comics via their buyout of Wildstorm—created a new character for the series, Baxter Montgomery, code-named Fortress. The villain has been revealed as the original Spawn, Al Simmons, now known as Omega Spawn.
Plot.
The story begins with Fortress appearing unsure of his new powers and still adjusting to them. This leads to a run-in with Savage Dragon, who assumes the worst about Fortress, still adjusting to his powers, Fortress accidentally knocks Dragon to the ground. Before the altercation can continue, they both run into Doc Seismic, and a fight ensues, resulting in Fortress finally taking down Seismic after absorbing all his energy. Dragon then thanks Fortress for his help, but after trying to bring him in, Fortress flies off unable to handle the amount of energy he absorbed. He then crashes down onto the ground and passes out after having a vision of all the Image Comics characters standing together.
Issue #1 begins with Fortress continuing to have his vision of the Image Universe characters, in said vision, they are facing an evil they cannot possibly stand against and they are all systematically taken down. Fortress snaps out of it to find himself on a roof in Chicago, before he can get his bearings, he sees Overt-Kill down in the street causing mass destruction while Youngblood arrive on the scene to face down Overt-Kill. Dragon sees the commotion and joins the fray, teaming with Youngblood to stop Overt-Kill.
Meanwhile at Cyberforce HQ, Cyberforce are seeing violent incidents rising all over the country. Unsure of where to assist first, they conclude that all these incidents arising at the same time can be no coincidence and there must be a larger force at work. At that point Velocity runs in and informs them of big mess in downtown New York City, and they decide to go there first.
Back in Chicago, Dragon and Youngblood are still fighting down Overt-Kill, are not having much success. Fortress, tired of standing by, joins the fray, just in time for Diehards' current body to be destroy by Overt-Kill. He uploads himself into a new body, and as he departs Youngblood HQ, Troll informs him that a new recruit is waiting before he runs out. Fortress, Shaft, Badrock and Dragon continue to engage Overt-Kill in Chicago.
At Youngblood HQ, Eddie Collins, Shadowhawk, is waiting to audition for the team with his father. Troll runs in and informs him Shaft is out in the field, and that he will be handling the final evaluation. Eddie suits up and says that he is ready.
Back in Chicago, Badrock gets the upper hand on Overt-Kill and destroys his body. Overt-Kill launches his head off, but Shaft grounds him before he can escape. Fortress sees the battle is over, but cannot help but feel that worse things are coming and he must gather more forces. Diehard returns and takes Vogue to a hospital to be treated for her wounds. Dragon starts to leave but Fortress stops him by slamming him into a wall and starts screaming that the world needs them and terrible danger is coming. Dragon punches him down unsure of what Fortress is talking about, Shaft steps in and says that Youngblood will take him into custody.
Back at Youngblood HQ, Shadowhawk has apparently passed all evaluations with flying colors and Troll tells him that he's as good as in. Cougar runs by and tells Troll that Girth, Quantum and Crypt are all active in different locations and that Youngblood is splitting into three teams to assist. Troll tells Shadowhawk that while he must stay to coordinate the effort, they could use Shadowhawk in the field. Shadowhawk agrees with almost no hesitation.
In New York City, Jim Downing is sitting in a room when a voice tells him to rise, and that he is a piece of a plan that has already been set into motion. Jim is unsure of who it is and transforms into Spawn, demanding to know who it is and what they want. Al Simmons then reveals himself as the Omega Spawn, and says that he wants it all, and that Jim Downing is going to help him get it.
Back in Chicago, Dragon arrives back home to find Malcolm watching TV and Angel attempting to help with the chaos. Dragon forbids her before he is called in by the Police Department. His only comment being, "What in the world is going on...?"
At Youngblood HQ, Shaft goes to visit Fortress in his cell, once there Shaft demands to know what he was going on about to Dragon earlier. Fortress says he only knows bits, but that it's going to get worse, and if they do not gather everyone against the coming threat, they will all die.
In New York, Jim Downing comes face to face with Al Simmons, where Al Simmons makes all his plans clear to end the world, and he asks Jim to help him. Jim refuses and engages Omega Spawn in a battle, where Al easily gains the upper hand. Omega Spawn makes it very clear that he is superior, and informs Jim that he will never truly know what he was a part of, and he will never have the answers his sought, as he attempts to deliver a final blow Jim teleports himself to a hospital. He attempts to warn them of the coming threat, but is too weak. He is taken into care by Ann Stevens.
Coincidentally enough this is also the hospital Diehard brought Vogue too after their fight with Overt-Kill. Vogue appears to be sleeping or passed out, and as Diehard attempts to tell her how he feels about her, the hospital is attacked. Diehard rushes to get Vogue to safety, as Ann changes into Mighty Man to assist against the attack.
Shaft continues to speak with Fortress, with Fortress explaining everything, only for Shaft to doubt his story. Shaft rushes off to assist in the fights as Fortress yells that they need all the help they can get.
In New York Sara Pezzini sees Youngblood and Shadowhawk engaged in a fight with more villains, and rushes in to assist with the Witchblade.
In Chicago SuperPatriot is attempting to fight off even more villains as Dragon enters the fray. After defeating them, they are called in to assist at the hospital where Mighty Man and Diehard are still engaged in battle. Dragon and SuperPatriot enter the fray to assist, but are interrupted by the timely intervention of Spawn who dispatches the villains with ease as the other heroes assist in evacuating the Hospital.
Over in Hartford, Cyberforce is still engaged in battle, which is ended due to the intervention of apparently newcomer, Barricade, who apparently also got his powers from Cyberdata. Cyberforce decides to keep Barricade with them, and check in with Youngblood to see if they have a better understanding of what is going on.
Flashes are shown of Seattle, Huntington, St. Louis. Orlando, Detroit and Los Angeles, showing The Darkness amongst others engaged in battle with multiple villains who all appear to be getting the upper hand.
In Chicago, Spawn is explaining the situation to Diehard and Dragon, and reveals Al Simmons, the Omega Spawn as the villain to them. At that moment, Youngblood arrives to pick up Diehard, who takes Dragon and Spawn with him for any help and information they can provide.
Back at Youngblood HQ, Fortress continually tells himself that it's too late. The New York Youngblood team has defeated their villains and Shadowhawk is telling his dad that is fine. Shaft and his father are at the HQ, and await their return.
In New York a massive group of villains has assembled, poised to destroy New York City, under the orders of the Omega Spawn. They run towards the Statue of Liberty in a group attack.
Reception.
The first issue selling just over 42,000 copies, and the second selling around 27,500. Both issues sold out, warranting additional printings. Despite the good sales, the series thus far has received poor reviews. Comic Book Resources awarded the first issue two stars out of five, another review from the website gave it one-and-a-half stars out of five. IGN gave similar reviews, awarding issue #1 a "Mediocre" score of 5.8 out of 10 and issue #2 a "Bad" score of 4.3 out of 10,
Delays.
Additional criticism fell upon the delays between the second and third issue. Rob Liefeld commented on his Twitter, saying, "It goes without saying that "Image United" is a massive embarrassment. Damn shame the enthusiasm for the book not shared by all."
Said delays have also caused multiple spin off books to be produced. First was "Image United" #0, also written by Robert Kirkman, featuring the same jam style art contributions from Erik Larsen and Whilce Portacio, drawing Savage Dragon and Fortress respectively, and additional art by Image mainstay Ryan Ottley, handling art chores for Doc Seismic. It was initially released as a four-part back-up ran in Savage Dragon, Invincible, Witchblade, and Spawn. It was meant to act as a prelude to the series and was collected in a single issue (with a bonus parody story, "Image Untied" by "G-Man" creator Chris Giarrusso) in February.
The second book was to be called "Image United Interlude", also written by Kirkman, featuring art by Ryan Ottley. Solicitations for the book focused on the effects of the story' on other characters within the Image Universe, including Invincible. It was meant to follow the "cataclysmic events" of "Image United" #3.
"Image United" #4 and #5 were solicited for an April and May 2010 release, and another fill-in issue titled "Image United: Interlude" was solicited for March 31, 2010. That interlude would feature other heroes from the Image Universe such as Invincible but was not published. In December 2010, Kirkman stated in a video interview that "Image United" was definitely going to finish the book. In March 2011, Erik Larsen commented that issue #4 was 'about 60% done,' and that he was laying out issue #5. In January 2011, Erik Larsen stated, ""Image United" #4 is about 60% done. The thing is, there are pages that are completely done and sitting there finished and there are others out there that need one guy to come in and do his character then it's done. There's a few pages where more work is needed and three or four guys all need to be jamming and not everybody showed up. It's kind of a mish-mash in terms of that." As the "defacto middleman and editor" of the book, Larsen explained that other commitments prevented the creators involved from finishing their work on time, but stated that McFarlane took responsibility for the nine-month delay between the second and third issues.

Decoration of Merit

The Decoration of Merit is an important military decoration for bravery in the Netherlands The medal was established by the Dutch minister of defence Wim van Eekelen on 16 April 1987. The award was created by ministerial decree and is therefore a medal of the Netherlands Ministry of Defence and not a royal decoration.
Defence ministries in Germany and the Czech Republic award similar decorations. This way chivalric orders keep their exclusivity.
The ministerial decree requires four criteria for granting:
In 2002, minister Benk Korthals added a fifth criteria for granting the medal:
The award is granted in silver or gold.
The medal is the sixth highest military decoration, after the Medal of Recognition, still being awarded for bravery.
Design.
The medal has the shape of an old Dutch fortresses in the style that was introduced in the late 17th century by the Dutch fortress builder Menno van Coehoorn. The moat of the hexagonal fortresses has been reflected in blue emaille. In the middle of the depicted fortresses the symbols of three of the four branches of the Netherlands armed forces are displayed. These are the "climbing lion with sword and arrows" of the Royal Netherlands Army, the "anchor" of the Royal Netherlands Navy, and the "flying eagle" of the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The "burning grenade", the symbol of the fourth branch, the Royal Marechaussee, is lacking. On the reverse side, the words "KONINKRIJK DER NEDERLANDEN" (English: "Kingdom of the Netherlands") and "MINISTER VAN DEFENSIE" (English: "Minister of Defence") are engraved in a circle.
The medal is worn with a Nassau blue ribbon that has narrow red and white borders. Recipients may wear a ribbon bar at their uniform with the same composition (although on the ribbon bar of the golden medal a golden palm branch is added).
American sergeant posthumously awarded.
On 12 September 2007 American sergeant Alexander van Aalten, (a descendant of Dutch ancestors) posthumously received the Decoration of Merit in gold. On 20 April 2007 Van Aalten, while in Afghanistan, volunteered to assist in the recovery of the body of a fallen Dutch Corporal Strik who had been killed by an improvised explosive device. Van Aalten was however killed himself by a land mine while attempting to retrieve the body of Strik. The golden Decoration of Merit was presented by Netherlands minister of defence Eimert van Middelkoop to the widow Shana van Aalten. The family of sergeant Van Aalten chose to have their son buried at at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, USA. The presentation was at Arlington.
Van Aalten was a member of the 82nd Airborne 1-508 PIR, an American airborne infantry division. The 82nd Airborne played a large role in the liberation of the Netherlands during the Second World War. During the Battle of Arnhem this division suffered heavy losses. Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands authorized the attachment of the cross of Military William Order to the standard of the regiment for the liberation of Nijmegen.

BL 7.5 inch Mk II – V naval gun

The BL 7.5 inch guns Mk II - Mk V were a variety of 50 calibres naval guns used by Britain in World War I. They all had similar performance and fired the same shells.
History.
Mark II.
Mark II guns were originally developed to suit India's coast defence requirements. During World War I several reserve guns made for India but still in the UK were employed as coast defence guns in the UK. They were scrapped or sent to India soon after the war.
Marks II*, II**, V.
These were built and employed specifically as naval guns and were mounted as secondary armament as a heavier alternative to 6-inch guns, on the following ships :
<br style="clear:left;" >
Mark III.
Mark III guns were built by Elswick Ordnance to arm the battleship "Constitución" they were building for Chile. Britain acquired them by default when she bought "Constitución" in 1903 to avoid the risk of them being acquired by Russia. "Constitución" became HMS "Swiftsure" in British service.
"Swiftsure" was decommissioned in 1917 and her guns were used for coast defence in Britain, as siege guns on the Belgian coast near Nieuport for attacking German batteries, and on "M15"-class monitors.

List of Royal Malaysian police officers killed in the line of duty

This is a list of Malaysian police officers from the Royal Malaysian Police who were killed in the line of duty, based on official records from the year 1915 to date. Line of duty deaths refers to any police officer who has died while carrying out duty which he is obligated and/or authorised to carry out. This would include officers who respond to incidents while off-duty as obligated by the Police Force Act, as well as those commuting to and from their place of duty or training.
Police records show a total of 1,346 policemens were killed in the line of duty while 10,698 communist members were killed, of which 5,972 were killed by the police force. The police, being the main law enforcement agency in the country were tasked during the Emergency period to combat and foil attempts by the communist party wanting to set up a communist state via the use of force and firearms.
Trends.
Causes of death.
The ethnic profile of police officers has been traditionally disproportionate compared to the national ethnic profile, with a significantly higher proportion of ethnic Malays especially in the earlier decades. However, the number of casualties involving ethnic Malay police officers are statistically higher overall due in part to the high mortality rates involving the ethnic Malay community during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950-1970s, and in part to the ethnic composition of the police force.
Incidents by chronology.
The following cases are listed by the date of death of Malaysian police, although the incident attributing to death may have occurred earlier. The indicated ranks are as at time of death, and do not include posthumous promotions. Ranks/service numbers are colour-coded based on the cause of death as per the following general classifications. Uncoded entries refer to cases whereby incident details are unknown or unclear:

Bornholm Art Museum

The Bornholm Art Museum ("Bornholms Kunstmuseum") is situated on the Danish island of Bornholm, above the Sanctuary Rocks (Helligdomsklipperne) about 15 kilometres north-west of Gudhjem. The building was constructed in 1993 and enlarged in 2003. The museum's permanent collection consists principally of paintings by artists with connections to Bornholm from the early 19th century to the present day. Special attention is given to the Bornholm school of painters which emerged at the beginning of the last century when a number of modernists, attracted to picturesque Bornholm and the tiny island of Christiansø, painted landscapes and local nature.
The permanent exhibition includes works by Edvard Weie, Karl Isakson, Olaf Rude, Kræsten Iversen, Niels Lergaard and Oluf Høst.
In addition, numerous paintings and works of sculpture present a rich picture of artistic life on Bornholm. 
Covering an area of some 4,000 square meters, the museum itself is an impressive architectural achievement. Designed by architects Johan Fogh and Per Følner, it is divided into three levels as the ground the slopes down towards the sea. The galleries are situated on either side of a kind of street where water trickles down from the age-old Helligdomskilde healing spring.

Botan River

The Botan River ( , "Botan Suyu" aka "Uluçay"), is located in the Siirt Province of southeastern Turkey. It originates in the high mountains west of the Nordüz Plateau, which form the border of Siirt Province to Hakkari and Van, and flows eastwards before it turns to the northwest. The river has shaped a canyon on its way. The altitude difference between the valley and the top of the mountains reaches about .
The rivers Çatak and Büyükdere join it at Çukurca in Hakkari Province, after which it is named Botan Suyu (Uluçay). Running westwards by east of Aydınlar and Siirt, it reaches Bostancık locality. Here, the rivers Zorava and Bitlis join the Botan. Finally at Çattepe in Siirt Province, it joins the Tigris River, after which the Tigris sharply turns southwards.
The discharge of Botan River from spring to mid-summer averages about 100–300 m³/s , while it reaches in April and June about 400–600 m³/s (14,000–21,000 cu ft/s, and in May it peaks at about 700–1,000 m³/s (25,000–35,000 cu ft/s and sometimes more. At this time, it looks much bigger than the Tigris River. At the end of summer or in the fall, its depth is not less than , and its outflow not less than around 60–80 m³/s .
Crossing is only possible by boat. The river runs in narrow, deep and steep valleys. Lowlands are rare on its way, preventing it use for irrigation.
Dams.
For the purpose of building hydroelectric power plants, studies have been carried out on several places at the river. Seven dams in different sizes are planned be built on the Botan River.
The first dam and hydroelectric plant just below Aydınlar (Tillo) district has been completed. Officially named the "Alkumru Dam", it is also locally called the "Tillo Dam" due to the native name of the district. It is a rock-fill dam of height having 222 MW installed capacity. The amount of energy to be generated is 812 GWh, of which 350 GWh is firm energy The mean annual discharge is 129 m³/s . Downstream of the Alkumru Dam is the Kirazlık Dam to regulate its outflows and produce hydroelectric power; an installed capacity of 45 MW.
The Çetin Dam, which is currently under construction, will have a 405 MW power capacity. The total investment amount for the project is expected to be approximately US$450 million. Other planned dams on the river include the Pervari and Keskin.
In history.
Greek historian Xenophon (ca. 431 – 355 BC), pupil of Socrates, mentions the crossing of the river Kentrites (the Botan) in his "Anabasis" ("The Expedition" or "The March Up Country"), §151.

Makemie Memorial Presbyterian Church

Makemie Memorial Presbyterian Church is a historic Presbyterian church located in Snow Hill, Wocester County, Maryland. The church was established by immigrants from England, Scotland, and Ulster.Makmie Memorial is generally regarded as being the first church in America to issue a call to a pastor. The original church building was a log structure located within a block of the Pocomoke River, which in 1683 was the main means of travel in the area given the vast wet-lands in Worcester County. The second structure was a frame building built on the current property on West Market Street, but it was built close to the center of the grave yard on the top of the little rise. That building burned and was replaced by a brick structure on the same spot. That building served for a number of years until it too was damaged by fire. In 1883, for the 200th anniversary of the organization of the church, it was resolved to build a Makemie Memorial Church in honor of its founder, Reverend Francis Makemie (1658 – 1708). The present building designed by noted Philadelphia architect Isaac Pursell. It was started in 1887 and dedicated on June 29, 1890. It is the only church in the United States with the name, Makemie Memorial. It is a Gothic Revival structure, built of red brick with red sandstone trim. There are five beautiful memorial windows in the sanctuary and the vaulted ceiling is supported by hand hewn, exposed wooded arches. It has two unequal tall towers. Maryland Senator Ephraim King Wilson II (1821 - 1891) is buried in the adjacent graveyard, as are former Governor Smith and his wife.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

Estonian Writers' Union

The Estonian Writers Union (Eesti Kirjanike Liit, abbreviated EKL), is a professional association of Estonian writers and literary critics. 
History.
The Estonian Writers Union was founded on the 8th of October 1922 under the name "Eesti Kirjanike Liit" at the 3rd Congress of Estonian writers held at the Tallinn Town Hall. On 27 April 1923, the association began the publication of the monthly magazine "Looming" ("Creation"), which is one of the most important literary magazines in Estonia. In 1927 the association expanded to Tartu with the opening of a branch there.
With the Soviet occupation of Estonia, the Estonian Writers Union was dissolved on 19 October 1940. The occupation authorities launched the "Soviet Estonia Writers Union" (Eesti Nõukogude Kirjanike Liit), on 8th or 9 October 1943 in Moscow. From 1958 it was called "Writers Union of the Estonian SSR" (Eesti NSV Kirjanike Liit) and was active until the end of the Soviet Union. 
During the German occupation in Estonia from 1941 to 1944, the original Estonian writers' association unofficially continued its work. In 1945, the "International Estonian Writers Union" (Välismaine Eesti Kirjanike Liit) was founded in Stockholm as the organization of exiled Estonian writers as a counter organization to the "Soviet Estonia Writers Union". 
With the restoration of Estonian independence came the restoration of free expression and press freedom in Estonia, the association in Estonia was renamed Estonian Writers Union in 1991. The International Association merged with the Estonian Writers Union in October 2000. 
Currently, the Estonian Writers Union has 302 members (as of July 2007). Its headquarters is located in the Old Town of Tallinn and has a branch in Tartu. Estonian Writers Association also has a summer house in Käsmu on the Baltic Sea, which is regularly made available for domestic and foreign writers.

Kjartan Slettemark

Kjartan Slettemark (6 August 1932 — 13 December 2008) was a Norwegian-Swedish artist.
Career.
He first made a name for himself as an artist with a collage he placed in front of the Parliament of Norway in 1965, titled "From a report from Vietnam: Children are splashed with napalm. Their skin is burnt into black wounds and they die." This work of art consists among other things of a red mouth, an American flag and a child figure. It was donated to the National Gallery in Oslo in 1982.
He started to make passports (very alike those official at the time) for the fictional country Kjartanistan. Around 500 were made for persons interested in citizenship.
In the mid-1960s Slettemark was a teacher at an art school in Stockholm, and he took Swedish citizenship in 1966. In his teaching, he fell out with the school's leadership when he refused to give his pupils marks. In order to solve the problem, he handed them little colourful drawings instead. He was consequently fired, and had to apply for financial support from the social security. However Stockholm's social services wanted it clarified whether Slettemark was an ordinary unemployed person, or a patient with a mental illness. Slettemark insisted that he was an artist, but was diagnosed borderline, and received a prescription for Hibernal (tablets for treatment of psychosis). Instead of taking the pills, Slettemark used them in his art. During the happening "Lecture in the art of falling", he balanced on a line in Stockholm, visualizing his three years of conflict with Swedish psychiatry. The photographer Brita Olsson took pictures of the happening.
In the 1970s he worked on his "Nixon visions", travelling Europe with a photo of Nixon, equipped with Slettemark's hair and beard, in his passport. During this period, he also figured in a self-made poodle costume, after the inspector at Stockholm's social service had told Slettemark to report at "hundmottagningen" (the dog reception), instead of "kundmottagningen" (the customer reception). The pun is lost in English, but inspired Slettemark to spend half a year constructing the costume, complete with inlaid sound from a television jackpot programme. Slettemark only had to unscrew the costume's tail when he sat down in the tube.
In 2003 Slettemark made "Self-portrait with Marilyn", an Andy Warhol-inspired collage series, staging himself as Marilyn Monroe. Another project of his was the introduction to Kjartanistan, a non-territorial state with planet Earth as capital city, and himself as prime minister.

It became the Marine Aircraft Experimental Depot, comprising 3 sections:
It was renamed "Marine and Armament Experimental Establishment" on 16 March 1920 in recognition of the fact that weapons and other equipment were evaluated as well as complete aircraft. It was renamed again on the 1 March 1924 to the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment and eventually moved to Felixstowe.

St. Helen's Church, St. Helens is a parish church in the Church of England located in St Helens on the Isle of Wight.
History.
The church was built originally in 1717 and was rebuilt in 1831 and the chancel in 1862. 
The original church of St. Helens was in a bad state as far back as the 16th century, according to the presentment of George Oglander, the centoner of St. Helens. By the 18th century it had become so ruinous that a new church was built in 1717 about a mile inland, and the old church allowed to go to ruin, the tower, a 13th-century structure, only being left standing. The tower about the same time was supported by brickwork and formed into a seamark. 
In 1831 the church was rebuilt, and in 1862 a new chancel was erected. The present church is a stone structure with brick dressings, and consists of an aisleless nave, with transepts, a chancel, and west tower with one bell. There is a mural tablet to Sir Nash Grose, who died in 1814, and his son Edward.

Jyoti Bhatt

Jyotindra Manshankar Bhatt (12 March 1934), is an Indian artist best known for his modernist work in painting and printmaking and also his photographic documentation of rural Indian culture. He studied painting under N. S. Bendre and K.G. Subramanyan at the Faculty of Fine Arts, Maharaja Sayajirao University (M.S.U.), Baroda. Later he studied fresco and mural painting at Banasthali Vidyapith in Rajasthan, and in the early 1960s went on to study at the Academia di Belle Arti in Naples, Italy, as well the Pratt Institute in New York.
Biography.
Bhatt moved from a cubist influence in his early work, to a lighthearted and colorful Pop art that often drew its imagery from traditional Indian folk designs. Though Bhatt worked in a variety of mediums, including watercolors and oils, it is his printmaking that ultimately garnered him the most attention. In 1966 Bhatt returned to M.S.U. Baroda with a thorough knowledge of the intaglio process that he had gained at the Tamarind Workshop in New York. It was partially Bhatt’s enthusiasm for intaglio that caused other artists such as Jeram Patel, Bhupen Khakhar and Gulammohammed Sheikh, to take up the same process. Bhatt, and his compatriots at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Baroda, soon came to be known as “The Baroda School” of Indian art.
Late in the 1960s Bhatt was asked to take photographs of Gujarati folk art. Initially this work was done for a seminar, but it soon became one of the artist’s passions to document traditional Indian craft and design work. The disappearing arts of rural Gujarat became a focus. Though Bhatt’s investigations into village and tribal designs certainly influenced the motifs he used in his printmaking, Bhatt considers his documentary photographs to be an art form in themselves. His direct and simply composed photographs have become valued on their own merit. 
Throughout Bhatt’s long career as a teacher at the M.S.U. Faculty of Fine Arts, he has photographed the evolution of the university, the artistic activities of its faculty and students, and the architecturally significant buildings of Baroda. This huge body of work is perhaps the best assembled photographic documentation that pertains to “The Baroda School” of Indian art.
It is Jyoti Bhatt’s prints, however, that are most associated with the artist. His etchings, intaglios, and screen prints have explored and re-explored a personal language of symbols that stem from Indian culture: the peacock, the parrot, the lotus, stylized Indian gods and goddesses, and unending variations on tribal and village designs. Recently he has explored digital printing and holography.
His work is in numerous international collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, The Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C., and The British Museum, London.

Signature tag

Signature tags or sig tags are small digital images that are used to accompany an HTML-formatted email or Internet forum post. They are also often used on social networking pages. They are used as a mark of recognition or individualism, or to convey emotion, sentiment, or sometimes support for the illustrated concept. 
Sig tags are often personalised with the user's name by manipulation in a graphics software package. Sig tags are particularly popular with teenage computer users, and those who are socially active online. A sig tag is generally used below or at the end of a message, in contrast to an avatar, which is generally used next to the name of the poster on a forum.
Sig tag subjects and types.
Popular subjects for sig tags are smileys, dollz, popular media figures from music, or TV shows, signs, cute animals, flowers and seasonal greetings.
A small image with a generalised, non-customised slogan, used in the same way, is generally just known as a graphics tag, or a snag (because they are 'snagged' or downloaded quickly from an originating website).
Sig tags are sometimes animated, using the .gif file format. Graphics software programs such as Corel Paint Shop Pro and Adobe Photoshop are popular choices for the manipulation of digital images in creating sig tags.
Sig tag creation.
A complex custom sig tag may consist of a number of amalgamated elements, which may be obtained online from popular sig tag community resources. These elements may include a mask (grid or background), a tube (image or figure on a transparent background), embellishments (additional decorative objects), and textures. These elements are normally used subject to copyright restrictions similar to those imposed on the use of dollz (dollz netiquette).
The sig tag community.
The creation of sig tags is a widespread online hobby, regarded as a subsidiary of graphic art. It has been a long-lived phenomenon in internet terms, with little recorded history, and obscure, non-specified origins. This is largely due to its collaborative nature, and the disappearance of various websites important in the development of the hobby.
The sig tag community is notable by its emphasis on sharing, mutual support, advice and appreciation. In fact, a conventional classing system (Novice, Moderate, Intermediate, Semi-Professional, Professional) is sometimes used to rank people on their skills in making sig tags. Many sig tag websites feature a busy forum and tutorials and users are encouraged to download images. Increasingly, these sites tend to be membership-based.
Commercial sites.
Some graphic artists have developed their skills or moved into the production of sig tags as a business. They generally offer user-licences, customisation of their sig tags, and purchaseable downloadable elements to be used by the user in building personal sig tags.

Artificial vagina

An artificial vagina is a device designed to imitate the female sex organ. To achieve this, it will generally be made of a soft material, lubricated, and sometimes heated. It may be designed for medical research purposes, animal breeding, or as a sex toy for erotic stimulation.
__TOC__
Veterinary use.
Artificial vaginas are widely used by farms in cattle artificial insemination programs and semen collection centers for collecting animal sperm and its further application. An artificial vagina designed for collecting semen will imitate some or all of the anatomical features and behaviors of an animal's vagina.
There are several types of collecting apparatus, but the general design uses a tube with a normally sterile inner liner and hard outer shell. The walls of the tube may be hollow and filled with warm water to mimic a natural body temperature for better results, and may contain a filter to separate the semen.
Human use.
An artificial vagina for the purposes of sexual stimulation is essentially an aid to human masturbation; and is also known as "masturbation aid", "masturbator", or "pocket pussy". It is designed to simulate the sensation of sexual intercourse on the erect penis and to induce orgasm and ejaculation. It will often have moving parts such as vibrators that increase stimulation rather than accurately simulate a woman's vagina.
Usually the artificial vagina has a realistic or close to realistic appearance with a sleeve, where the penis can be inserted. The sleeve, or as it is also called "vaginal tunnel", measures in average from 10 to 20 centimetres (4 to 8 inches) and can have an open end for inserting a vibrating bullet, if the user wishes.
Types.
Realistic.
This type of artificial vagina is modeled on female genitals. For the advertising purposes many manufacturers design the vagina like the exact replica of some famous pornographic actress' vulva. Realistic vaginas are made to simulate the natural physiology: pubic bones, hair, labia, all natural creases and dimples, etc.
Several realistic vaginas are manufactured with a narrower anal orifice for those users who also like to simulate anal sex. The natural vagina has a series of ridges called Rugae, and manufacturers often add nubs or ribs into artificial vaginas to simulate the rugae and enhance pleasure.
In Japan, onacups are popular disposable artificial vaginas that simulate various sex acts and come with lubricant already inside.
Vibrating.
These artificial vaginas superficially resemble the previous one, but they have the added feature of a vibrating element — usually a removable vibrating bullet that can be easily inserted into a hole into the bottom or the end of the sleeve. For more intensive sensations there are a variety of functions: vibrating, pulsating, surging, rotating, multi-speed, etc.
Vibrating bullets are usually controlled by a panel connected by a wire. Some kinds of vibrating artificial vagina are designed effect, replicating the role of a penis pump—with a bulb squeezed by the user.
Improvised.
In prison slang, a "fifi" refers to an artificial vagina usually made by rolling a trash bag or condom inside of a towel, and using some sort of lubrication such as hand lotion. 
Materials.
The artificial vagina as a sex toy is designed from the materials that maximally imitate the natural skin. The materials used in manufacturing artificial vaginas are stretchable and elastic for accommodating any penis size.
The above materials are all porous and therefore require special care to avoid bacterial accumulation. Manufacturers recommend protecting them by applying a condom during use. This is less of a concern with artificial vaginas made from silicone, which, while generally more expensive, is non-porous and can be disinfected after cleaning with a bleach solution or heat.
Medical usage.
Masturbators are sometimes used for medical research. For example, Kobori "et al." at Dokkyo Medical University have applied a Japanese "onacup" for ejaculatory dysfunction studies.

Heleus was brother of Perses, Alcaeus, Sthenelus, Electryon, Mestor, Cynurus, Gorgophone and Autochthe. He accompanied his nephew Amphitryon on
the expedition to Taphos, and after the victory shared the sovereignty of their domain with Cephalus.
A town Helos in Laconia was said to have been founded by and named after him.

Screw

A screw, or bolt, is a type of fastener characterized by a helical ridge, known as an "external thread" or just "thread", wrapped around a cylinder. Some screw threads are designed to mate with a complementary thread, known as an "internal thread", often in the form of a nut or an object that has the internal thread formed into it. Other screw threads are designed to cut a helical groove in a softer material as the screw is inserted. The most common uses of screws are to hold objects together and to position objects.
A screw will always have a "head", which is a specially formed section on one end of the screw that allows it to be turned, or "driven". Common tools for driving screws include screwdrivers and wrenches. The head is usually larger than the body of the screw, which keeps the screw from being driven deeper than the length of the screw and to provide a "bearing surface". There are exceptions; for instance, carriage bolts have a domed head that is not designed to be driven; set screws often have a head smaller than the outer diameter of the screw; J-bolts have a J-shaped head which is not designed to be driven, but rather is usually sunk into concrete allowing it to be used as an anchor bolt. The cylindrical portion of the screw from the underside of the head to the tip is known as the "shank"; it may be fully threaded or partially threaded. The distance between each thread is called the "pitch".
The majority of screws are tightened by clockwise rotation, which is termed a "right-hand thread"; a common mnemonic device for remembering this when working with screws or bolts is "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey." Screws with left-hand threads are used in exceptional cases. For example, when the screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque (which would work to undo a right-hand thread), a left-hand-threaded screw would be an appropriate choice. The left side pedal of a bicycle has a left-hand thread.
More generally, screw may mean any helical device, such as a clamp, a micrometer, a ship's propeller or an Archimedes' screw water pump.
Differentiation between bolt and screw.
There is no universally accepted distinction between a screw and a bolt. "Machinery's Handbook" describes the distinction as follows:
This distinction is consistent with ASME B18.2.1 and some dictionary definitions for "screw" and "bolt".
The issue of what is a screw and what is a bolt is not completely resolved with "Machinery's Handbook" distinction, however, because of confounding terms, the ambiguous nature of some parts of the distinction, and usage variations. Some of these issues are discussed below:
Machine screws.
ASME standards specify a variety of "Machine Screws" in diameters ranging up to . These fasteners are often used with nuts as well as driven into tapped holes. They might be considered a screw or a bolt based on the "Machinery's Handbook" distinction. In practice, they tend to be mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as machine screws, although some kinds of machine screw can be referred to as stove bolts.
Hex cap screws.
ASME standard B18.2.1-1996 specifies Hex Cap Screws that range in size from in diameter. These fasteners are very similar to hex bolts. They differ mostly in that they are manufactured to tighter tolerances than the corresponding bolts. "Machinery's Handbook" refers parenthetically to these fasteners as "Finished Hex Bolts". Reasonably, these fasteners might be referred to as bolts, but based on the US government document "Distinguishing Bolts from Screws", the US government might classify them as screws because of the tighter tolerance. In 1991 responding to an influx of counterfeit fasteners Congress passed PL 101-592 "Fastener Quality Act" This resulted in the rewriting of specifications by the ASME B18 committee. B18.2.1 was re-written and as a result they eliminated the "Finished Hex Bolts" and renamed them the "Hex Cap Screw"—a term that had existed in common usage long before, but was now also being codified as an official name for the ASME B18 standard.
Lug bolts and head bolts.
These terms refer to fasteners that are designed to be threaded into a tapped hole that is in part of the assembly and so based on the "Machinery's Handbook" distinction they would be screws. Here common terms are at variance with "Machinery's Handbook" distinction.
Lag screw.
Lag screws, also sometimes called lag bolts, are basically "large wood screws". Square lag screws and hex lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1. A typical lag bolt can range in diameters from 1/4" to 1 1/4", and lengths from 1/4" to 6" or longer, with coarse threads of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger). The head is typically an external hex. The materials are usually carbon steel substrate with a coating of zinc galvanization (for corrosion resistance). The zinc coating may be bright (electroplated), yellow (electroplated), or dull gray hot-dip galvanized. Lag bolts are used to lag together lumber framing, to lag machinery feet to wood floors, and other heavy carpentry applications. These fasteners are clearly "screws" when defined by the "Machinery's Handbook" distinction. The term "lag bolt" has been replaced by "lag screw" in the "Machinery's Handbook". However, in the minds of most tradesmen, they are "bolts", simply because they are large, with hex or square heads. In the United Kingdom, lag bolts/screws are known as "coach screws" though this can also refer to carriage bolts (round head).
Government standards.
The US government made an effort to formalize the difference between a bolt and a screw because different tariffs apply to each. The document seems to have no significant effect on common usage and does not eliminate the ambiguous nature of the distinction between screws and bolts for some threaded fasteners. The document also reflects (although it probably did not originate) significant confusion of terminology usage that differs between the legal/statutory/regulatory community and the fastener industry. The legal/statutory/regulatory wording uses the terms "coarse" and "fine" to refer to the tightness of the tolerance range, referring basically to "high-quality" or "low-quality", but this is a poor choice of terms, because those terms in the fastener industry have a different meaning (referring to the steepness of the helix's lead).
Historical issue.
Old USS and SAE standards defined cap screws as fasteners with shanks that were threaded to the head and bolts as fasteners with shanks that were partially unthreaded. The relationship of this rule to the idea that a bolt by definition takes a nut is clear (because the unthreaded section of the shank, which is called the "grip", was expected to pass through the substrate without threading into it). This is now an obsolete distinction.
Controlled vocabulary versus natural language.
The distinctions above are enforced in the controlled vocabulary of standards organizations. Nevertheless, there are sometimes differences between the controlled vocabulary and the natural language use of the words by machinists, auto mechanics and others. These differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the changing of technology over centuries. The words "bolt" and "screw" have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed, and the natural usage of those words has evolved retronymously in response to the technological change. (That is, the use of words as names for objects changes as the objects themselves change.) Non-threaded fasteners predominated until the advent of practical, inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century. The basic meaning of the word "screw" has long involved the idea of a helical screw thread, but the Archimedes screw and the screw gimlet (like a corkscrew) preceded the fastener.
The word "bolt" is also a very old word, and it was used for centuries to refer to metal rods that passed through the substrate to be fastened on the other side, often via nonthreaded means (clinching, forge welding, pinning, wedging, etc.). The connection of this sense to the sense of a door bolt or the crossbow bolt is apparent. In the 19th century, bolts fastened via screw threads were often called "screw bolts" in contradistinction to "clench bolts".
In common usage, the distinction (not rigorous) is often that screws are smaller than bolts, and that screws are generally tapered while bolts are not. For example, cylinder head bolts are called "bolts" (at least in North American usage) despite the fact that by some definitions they ought to be called "screws". Their size and their similarity to a bolt that would take a nut seem linguistically to overrule any other factors in this natural word choice proclivity.
Other distinctions.
Bolts have been defined as headed fasteners having external threads that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as ISO metric screw thread M, MJ, Unified Thread Standard UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut. Screws are then defined as headed, externally threaded fasteners that do not meet the above definition of bolts. These definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the "Machinery's handbook" distinction. And it is for that reason, perhaps, that some people favor them. However, they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications.
A possible distinction is that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure to the opposite side of the component being fastened to. This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws for roof cladding, self-drilling and self-tapping screws for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.
On the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.
Types of screw and bolt.
Threaded fasteners either have a tapered shank or a non-tapered shank. Fasteners with tapered shanks are designed to either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.
Fasteners with built in washers.
A fastener with a built in washer is called a SEM or SEMS, short for pre-asSEMbled. It could be fitted on either a tapered or non-tapered shank.
Other threaded fasteners.
Superbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensioner.
A superbolt, or multi-jackbolt tensioner is an alternative type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts, bolts, or studs. Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts, which are threaded through the body of the nut and push against a hardened washer. Because of this, the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced. Installation and removal of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools, which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications.
Hanger screw or hanger bolt.
A hanger screw is a headless fastener that has machine screw threads on one end and self-tapping threads on the other designed to be driven into wood or another soft substrate. Often used for mounting legs to tables. Also known as a dowel screw.
List of abbreviations for types of screws.
These abbreviations have jargon currency among fastener specialists (who, working with many screw types all day long, have need to abbreviate repetitive mentions). The smaller basic ones can be built up into the longer ones; for example, if you know that "FH" means "flat head", then you may be able to parse the rest of a longer abbreviation containing "FH".
These abbreviations are not universally standardized across corporations; each corporation can coin their own. The more obscure ones may not be listed here.
The extra spacing between linked terms below helps the reader to see the correct parsing at a glance.
Materials.
Screws and bolts are usually made of steel. 
Where great resistance to weather or corrosion is required, like in very small screws or medical implants, materials such as stainless steel, brass, titanium, bronze, silicon bronze or monel may be used.
Galvanic corrosion of dissimilar metals can be prevented (using aluminum screws for double-glazing tracks for example) by a careful choice of material. 
Some types of plastic, such as nylon or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), can be threaded and used for fastenings requiring moderate strength and great resistance to corrosion or for the purpose of electrical insulation.
Often a surface coating is used to protect the fastener from corrosion (e.g. bright zinc plating for steel screws), to impart a decorative finish (e.g. japanning) or otherwise alter the surface properties of the base material.
Selection criteria of the screw materials include: size, required strength, resistance to corrosion, joint material, cost and temperature.
Bolted joints.
The American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) 13th Edition Steel Design Manual section 16.1 chapter J-3 specifies the requirements for bolted structural connections. Structural bolts replaced rivets due to decreasing cost and increasing strength of structural bolts in the 20th century. Connections are formed with two types of joints: slip-critical connections and bearing connections. In slip-critical connections, movement of the connected parts is a serviceability condition and bolts are tightened to a minimum required pretension. Slip is prevented through friction of the "faying" surface, that is the plane of shear for the bolt and where two members make contact. Because friction is proportional to the normal force, connections must be sized with bolts numerous and large enough to provide the required load capacity. However, this greatly decreases the shear capacity of each bolt in the connection. The second type and more common connection is a bearing connection. In this type of connection the bolts carry the load through shear and are only tightened to a "snug-fit". These connections require fewer bolts than slip-critical connections and therefore are a less expensive alternative. Slip-critical connections are more common on flange plates for beam and column splices and moment critical connections. Bearing type connections are used in light weight structures and in member connections where slip is not important and prevention of structural failure is the design constraint. Common bearing type connections include: shear tabs, beam supports, gusset plates in trusses.
Mechanical classifications.
The numbers stamped on the head of the bolt are referred to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an ISO strength rating (called "property class") stamped on the head. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the ultimate tensile strength in MPa divided by 100. The number after the point is 10 times the ratio of tensile yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8(500) = 400 MPa.
Ultimate tensile strength is the stress at which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% offset strain. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener is said to be operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region, since the fastener has suffered permanent plastic deformation.
Mild steel bolts have property class 4.6. High-strength steel bolts have property class 8.8 or above.
The same type of screw or bolt can be made in many different grades of material. For critical high-tensile-strength applications, low-grade bolts may fail, resulting in damage or injury. On SAE-standard bolts, a distinctive pattern of marking is impressed on the heads to allow inspection and validation of the strength of the bolt. However, low-cost counterfeit fasteners may be found with actual strength far less than indicated by the markings. Such inferior fasteners are a danger to life and property when used in aircraft, automobiles, heavy trucks, and similar critical applications.
Inch.
SAE J429 defines the bolt grades for inch-system sized bolts and screws. It defines them by "grade", which ranges from 0 to 8, with 8 being the strongest. Higher grades do not exist within the specification. SAE grades 5 and 8 are the most common.
Metric.
The international standard for metric screws is defined by ISO 898, specifically ISO 898-1. SAE J1199 and ASTM F568M are two North American metric standards that closely mimic the ISO standard. In case of inch sizes the grade is dictated by the number of radial shapes plus a value of two. Inch-system bolts use integer values to indicate grades but metric bolts use numbers with one decimal. The two North American standards use the same property class markings as defined by ISO 898. The ASTM standard only includes the following property classes from the ISO standard: 4.6, 4.8, 5.8, 8.8, 9.8, 10.9, and 12.9; it also includes two extra property classes: 8.8.3 and 10.9.3. ASTM property classes are to be stamped on the top of screws and it is preferred that the marking be raised.
Screw head shapes.
Some varieties of screw are manufactured with a break-away head, which snaps off when adequate torque is applied. This prevents tampering and also provides an easily inspectable joint to guarantee proper assembly. An example of this is the shear bolts used on vehicle steering columns, to secure the ignition switch.
s.
Modern screws employ a wide variety of drive designs, each requiring a different kind of tool to drive in or extract them. The most common screw drives are the slotted and Phillips in the US; hex, Robertson, and Torx are also common in some applications, and Pozidriv has almost completely replaced Phillips in Europe. Some types of drive are intended for automatic assembly in mass-production of such items as automobiles. More exotic screw drive types may be used in situations where tampering is undesirable, such as in electronic appliances that should not be serviced by the home repair person.
Tools.
The hand tool used to drive in most screws is called a "screwdriver". A power tool that does the same job is a "power screwdriver"; power drills may also be used with screw-driving attachments. Where the holding power of the screwed joint is critical, torque-measuring and "torque-limiting screwdrivers" are used to ensure sufficient but not excessive force is developed by the screw. The hand tool for driving hex head threaded fasteners is a "spanner" (UK usage) or "wrench" (US usage).
Thread standards.
There are many systems for specifying the dimensions of screws, but in much of the world the ISO metric screw thread preferred series has displaced the many older systems. Other relatively common systems include the British Standard Whitworth, BA system (British Association), and the Unified Thread Standard.
ISO metric screw thread.
The basic principles of the ISO metric screw thread are defined in international standard ISO 68-1 and preferred combinations of diameter and pitch are listed in ISO 261. The smaller subset of diameter and pitch combinations commonly used in screws, nuts and bolts is given in ISO 262. The most commonly used pitch value for each diameter is the "coarse pitch". For some diameters, one or two additional "fine pitch" variants are also specified, for special applications such as threads in thin-walled pipes. ISO metric screw threads are designated by the letter M followed by the major diameter of the thread in millimeters (e.g., "M8"). If the thread does not use the normal "coarse pitch" (e.g., 1.25 mm in the case of M8), then the pitch in millimeters is also appended with a multiplication sign (e.g. "M8×1" if the screw thread has an outer diameter of 8 mm and advances by 1 mm per 360° rotation).
The nominal diameter of a metric screw is the outer diameter of the thread. The tapped hole (or nut) into which the screw fits, has an internal diameter which is the size of the screw minus the pitch of the thread. Thus, an M6 screw, which has a pitch of 1 mm, is made by threading a 6 mm shank, and the nut or threaded hole is made by tapping threads into a hole of 5 mm diameter (6 mm - 1 mm).
Metric hexagon bolts, screws and nuts are specified, for example, in British Standard BS 4190 (general purpose screws) and BS 3692 (precision screws). The following table lists the relationship given in these standards between the thread size and the maximal width across the hexagonal flats (wrench size):
In addition, the following non-preferred intermediate sizes are specified:
Whitworth.
The first person to create a standard (in about 1841) was the English engineer Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth screw sizes are still used, both for repairing old machinery and where a coarser thread than the metric fastener thread is required. Whitworth became "British Standard Whitworth", abbreviated to BSW (BS 84:1956) and the "British Standard Fine" (BSF) thread was introduced in 1908 because the Whitworth thread was too coarse for some applications. The thread angle was 55°, and the depth and pitch varied with the diameter of the thread (i.e., the bigger the bolt, the coarser the thread). Spanners for Whitworth bolts are marked with the size of the bolt, not the distance across the flats of the screw head.
The most common use of a Whitworth pitch nowadays is in all UK scaffolding. Additionally, the standard photographic tripod thread, which for small cameras is 1/4" Whitworth (20 tpi) and for medium/large format cameras is 3/8" Whitworth (16 tpi). It is also used for microphone stands and their appropriate clips, again in both sizes, along with "thread adapters" to allow the smaller size to attach to items requiring the larger thread. Note that while 1/4" UNC bolts fit 1/4" BSW camera tripod bushes, yield strength is reduced by the different thread angles of 60° and 55° respectively.
British Association screw thread.
British Association (BA) screw threads, named after the British Association for Advancement of Science, were devised in 1884 and standardised in 1903. Screws were described as "2BA", "4BA" etc., the odd numbers being rarely used, except in equipment made prior to the 1970s for telephone exchanges in the UK. This equipment made extensive use of odd-numbered BA screws, in order—it may be suspected—to reduce theft. BA threads are specified by British Standard BS 93:1951 "Specification for British Association (B.A.) screw threads with tolerances for sizes 0 B.A. to 16 B.A."
While not related to ISO metric screws, the sizes were actually defined in metric terms, a 0BA thread having a 6 mm diameter and 1 mm pitch. Other threads in the BA series are related to 0BA in a geometric series with the common factors 0.9 and 1.2. For example, a 4BA thread has pitch formula_1 mm (0.65mm) and diameter formula_2 mm (3.62mm). Although 0BA has the same diameter and pitch as ISO M6, the threads have different forms and are not compatible.
BA threads are still common in some niche applications. Certain types of fine machinery, such as moving-coil meters and clocks, tend to have BA threads wherever they are manufactured. BA sizes were also used extensively in aircraft, especially those manufactured in the United Kingdom. BA sizing is still used in railway signalling, mainly for the termination of electrical equipment and cabling.
BA threads are extensively used in Model Engineering where the smaller hex head sizes make scale fastenings easier to represent. As a result many UK Model Engineering suppliers still carry stocks of BA fasteners up to typically 8BA and 10BA. 5BA is also commonly used as it can be threaded onto 1/8 rod.
Unified Thread Standard.
The Unified Thread Standard (UTS) is most commonly used in the United States of America, but is also extensively used in Canada and occasionally in other countries. The size of a UTS screw is described using the following format: X-Y, where X is the nominal size (the hole or slot size in standard manufacturing practice through which the shaft of the screw can easily be pushed) and Y is the threads per inch (TPI). For sizes inch and larger the size is given as a fraction; for sizes less than this an integer is used, ranging from 0 to 16. The integer sizes can be converted to the actual diameter by using the formula 0.060 + 0.013 * number. For example, a #4 screw is 0.060 + 0.013 * 4 = 0.112 inches in diameter. For most size screws there are multiple TPI available, with the most common being designated a Unified Coarse Thread (UNC or UN) and Unified Fine Thread (UNF or UF).
Manufacture.
There are three steps in manufacturing a screw: "heading", "thread rolling", and "coating". Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then cut to the proper length for the type of screw being made; this workpiece is known as a "blank". It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the "head" of the screw. The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a "slotting machine". These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.
The blanks are then polished again prior to threading. The threads are usually produced via thread rolling, however some are cut. The workpiece is then tumble finished with wood and leather media to do final cleaning and polishing. For most screws, a coating, such as electroplating with zinc (galvanizing) or applying black oxide, is applied to prevent corrosion.
History.
While a recent hypothesis attributes the Archimedes' screw to Sennacherib, King of Assyria, archaeological finds and pictorial evidence only appear in the Hellenistic period and the standard view holds the device to be a Greek invention, most probably by the 3rd century BC polymath Archimedes himself. Though resembling a screw, this is not a screw in the usual sense of the word.
Earlier, the screw had been described by the Greek mathematician Archytas of Tarentum (428–350 BC). By the 1st century BC, wooden screws were commonly used throughout the Mediterranean world in screw presses for pressing olive oil from olives and pressing juice from grapes in winemaking. Metal screws used as fasteners were rare in Europe before the 15th century, if known at all.
Rybczynski has shown that handheld screwdrivers (formerly called "turnscrews" in English, in more direct parallel to their original French name, "tournevis") have existed since medieval times (the 1580s at the latest), although they probably did not become truly widespread until after 1800, once threaded fasteners themselves had become commodified, as detailed below.
There were many forms of fastening in use before threaded fasteners became widespread. They tended to involve carpentry and smithing rather than machining, and they involved concepts such as dowels and pins, wedging, mortises and tenons, dovetails, nailing (with or without clenching the nail ends), forge welding, and many kinds of binding with cord made of leather or fiber, using many kinds of knots. Prior to the mid-19th century, cotter pins or pin bolts, and "clinch bolts" (now called rivets), were used in shipbuilding. Glues also existed, although not in the profusion seen today.
The metal screw did not become a common fastener until machine tools for their mass production were developed toward the end of the 18th century. This development blossomed in the 1760s and 1770s along two separate paths that soon converged: the mass production of "wood" screws screws made of metal to be used in wood in a specialized, single-purpose, high-volume-production machine tool; and the low-count, toolroom-style production of "machine" screws (V-thread) with easy selection among various pitches (whatever the machinist happened to need on any given day).
The first path was pioneered by brothers Job and William Wyatt of Staffordshire, UK, who patented in 1760 a machine that we might today best call a screw machine of an early and prescient sort. It made use of a leadscrew to guide the cutter to produce the desired pitch, and the slot was cut with a rotary file while the main spindle held still (presaging live tools on lathes 250 years later). Not until 1776 did the Wyatt brothers have a wood-screw factory up and running. Their enterprise failed, but new owners soon made it prosper, and in the 1780s they were producing 16,000 screws a day with only 30 employees—the kind of industrial productivity and output volume that would later be characteristic of modern industry but was revolutionary at the time.
Meanwhile, English instrument maker Jesse Ramsden (1735–1800) was working on the toolmaking and instrument-making end of the screw-cutting problem, and in 1777 he invented the first satisfactory screw-cutting lathe. The British engineer Henry Maudslay (1771–1831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his screw-cutting lathes of 1797 and 1800, containing the trifecta of leadscrew, slide rest, and change-gear gear train, all in the right proportions for industrial machining. In a sense he unified the paths of the Wyatts and Ramsden and did for machine screws what had already been done for wood screws, i.e., significant easing of production spurring commodification. His firm would remain a leader in machine tools for decades afterward. A misquoting of James Nasmyth popularized the notion that Maudslay had "invented" the slide rest, but this was incorrect; however, his lathes helped to popularize it.
These developments of the 1760–1800 era, with the Wyatts and Maudslay being arguably the most important drivers, caused great increase in the use of threaded fasteners. Standardization of threadforms began almost immediately, but it was not quickly completed; it has been an evolving process ever since. Further improvements to the mass production of screws continued to push unit prices lower and lower for decades to come, throughout the 19th century.
The development of the turret lathe (1840s) and of automatic screw machines derived from it (1870s) drastically reduced the unit cost of threaded fasteners by increasingly automating the machine tool control. This cost reduction spurred ever greater use of screws.
Throughout the 19th century, the most commonly used forms of screw head (that is, drive types) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to machine and served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s, but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian P. L. Robertson was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal cold forming as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways. Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive (hex socket) shortly followed in 1911. In the early 1930s, the Phillips-head screw was invented by Henry F. Phillips.
Threadform standardization further improved in the late 1940s, when the ISO metric screw thread and the Unified Thread Standard were defined.
Precision screws, for controlling motion rather than fastening, developed around the turn of the 19th century, were one of the central technical advances, along with flat surfaces, that enabled the industrial revolution. They are key components of micrometers and lathes.

Samuel Lee (judge)

Samuel Lee (March 28, 1756 – March 3, 1805) was a businessman, judge and politician in New Brunswick. He represented Northumberland County in the New Brunswick Legislative Assembly from 1795 to 1802.
He was born in Concord, Massachusetts, the son of Doctor Joseph Lee. Lee was educated at Harvard College and became a merchant in Penobscot (later Castine, Maine). As a loyalist, he settled in Restigouche, New Brunswick in 1784 and acquired land along the Restigouche River. Lee became involved in the trade in fish and timber. In 1787, he was named a justice of the peace and, two years later, a judge for the Inferior Court of Common Pleas. Lee was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1802.

Autochthe

In Greek mythology, Autochthe (Αὐτόχθη) was one of the two daughters of Perseus and Andromeda. Her sister was Gorgophone. Her brothers were Perses, Alcaeus, Heleus, Mestor, Sthenelus, Electryon and Cynurus. She married Aegeus and had by him several daughters, but no sons. Some traditions held that she was the only spouse of Aegeus, yet in other accounts Aegeus was said to have married and divorced several times because none of his wives bore him male heirs, which put his kingdom at risk of being usurped.

De jure belli ac pacis

De jure belli ac pacis () is a 1625 book in Latin, written by Hugo Grotius and published in Paris, on the legal status of war. It is now regarded as a foundational work in international law.
Content.
Its content owed much to Spanish theologians of the previous century, particularly Francisco de Vitoria and Francisco Suarez, working in the Catholic tradition of natural law.
Grotius began writing the work while in prison in the Netherlands. He completed it in 1623, at Senlis, in the company of Dirck Graswinckel.
According to Pieter Geyl:
It is an attempt by a theologically and classically educated jurist to base upon law order and security in the community of states as well as in the national society in which he had grown up. In the rather naïve rationalism, the belief in reason as the lord of life, is revealed the spiritual son of Erasmus.
In particular, this work is remembered for the Latin sentence:
"Et haec quidem quae iam diximus, locum aliquem haberent etiamsi daremus, quod sine summo scelere dari nequit, non esse Deum, aut non curari ab eo negotia humana"<br>
What we have been saying would have a degree of validity even if we should concede that which cannot be conceded without the utmost wickedness: that there is no God, or that the affairs of men are of no concern to Him.
Such a concept has been synthesized with the famous Latin phrase etsi deus non daretur, which means "even if God did not exist" but is normally translated "as if God did not exist".

Wide World

Wide World is a board game published by Parker Brothers, a subsidiary of Hasbro. The players are dealt a number of "Destination" cards. When a destination is visited then the player takes two "Product" cards, which are either worth 1 or 2 points. The player who visits all his destinations first then returns home is awarded an extra 5 points, and the player with the most points wins.
To get to their destinations the players roll a die, then move the number of squares shown. The players are not required to land on their destinations exactly (if they are 3 squares away then they can land on their destination if they roll a 5 for example). If a player lands on a red spot on the board, they must take a "Travel Agent" card and follow the directions printed on it. These cards may move the player around the board, allow them another turn and other actions.
In later versions of the game, a "Weather Vane" was added. It was a plastic sheet which covered a quarter of the board and when a six is rolled it moves, taking any player on it to a different part of the board.

Arnold Walker (RAF officer)

Arnold Edgar "Blondie" Walker DFC & Bar was a British fighter pilot during World War II who flew 169 sorties, was shot down three times, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross twice.
Early life.
Born in Warley Edge, Halifax, West Yorkshire, the son of a stonemason and builder, and youngest of three children, Walker (always known as 'Blondie') was educated at Heath Grammar School but left school early, aged 15, to join his father's building firm; he did however continue to study three nights a week at technical college for the national building exam. However,at the ago of 18 his father died, leaving Blondie in charge. At the outbreak of war, construction was deemed a reserved occupation, but he was "mad keen on flying" and immediately volunteered for the Royal Air Force.
RAF career.
Walker undertook pilot training in Canada under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. On completion of his training he was a sergeant. He was then commissioned into the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Service No 115919) as a pilot officer on probation on 1 December 1941. He returned to the UK and converted to the Hurricane. He was then sent to the Middle East, sailing to Freetown in Sierra Leone before flying across the desert to Khartoum and on to Port Said where he was mostly protecting convoys. His first kill was a Junkers Ju 88.
In August 1942, Walker joined No. 94 Squadron, which soon received four Hawker Hurricanes donated by Lady MacRobert, whose three sons had died while serving in the RAF, one of them with No. 94 Squadron. Their names and coat of arms were painted on the nose of the aircraft, and Walker was allocated "Sir Roderic", which he flew during the North African campaign. He was promoted war substantive flying officer on 1 October 1942.
After his experiences flying with No. 94 Squadron, Walker was offered an instructor's job. He did not want this, so volunteered to transfer to No. 6 Squadron RAF who were preparing to join the war in Italy. He was promoted to war substantive flight lieutenant on 1 December 1943.
On 8 August 1944, he was awarded an "immediate" Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), which is a field award, the citation read:
On 14 November 1944 he was awarded a bar to his DFC.
However, on his return from operations in October 1944, Blondie was posted as an instructor on the Hawker Typhoon, based in the New Forest. He was released from RAF service in 1946.
Postwar career.
Walker returned to Halifax to re-establish the family building company, Joseph Walker & Son, which had been shut down during the war. He wrote a short memoir of his wartime experiences with the dedication: "To my two ground crew – without your fabulous service of my aircraft I would not be alive today". 
Immediately after the war, Joseph Walker & Son built more than 2,000 council houses and 1,000 private houses. He continued to build houses in the Calderdale area of West Yorkshire for the next half century. He also had building interests in Perth, Western Australia, where he would later move to.
He was a Liberal councillor for Warley Ward in Halifax during the early 1950s and was elected president of the Halifax Building Trades Council.
Personal life.
Walker was known to be a fierce competitor in sport, business and life. He played golf off a handicap of four, was captain of West End Golf Club, Halifax and also made an honorary member of The Royal Perth Golf Club. He skied virtually every year in Kitzbühel from 1948 until he was 80 years old. He was known in Kitzbühel as "Halifax", some locals even assuming he was the Earl of Halifax.
He married three times. He married Maisie, who he had known since he was 18 before being sent to the Middle East in 1941. He had a son, Johnny who predeceased him in 2007, a daughter, Diana, three stepsons and two grandchildren, Melissa and Daniel.
In later life, Walker lived nine months of the year in Perth, spending the remainder in his hometown of Halifax, West Yorkshire.

A Few Good Men

A Few Good Men is a 1992 American drama film directed by Rob Reiner and starring Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, and Demi Moore, with Kevin Bacon, Kevin Pollak, James Marshall, J. T. Walsh, and Kiefer Sutherland in supporting roles. It was adapted for the screen by Aaron Sorkin from his play of the same name. A courtroom drama, the film revolves around the court martial of two U.S. Marines charged with the murder of a fellow Marine and the tribulations of their lawyers as they prepare a case to defend their clients.
Plot.
The film covers the court-martial of two U.S. Marines, Lance Corporal Dawson and Private Downey, who killed a fellow Marine, Private Santiago, at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. Santiago compared unfavorably to his fellow Marines, had poor relations with them, and failed to respect the chain of command in attempts at being transferred to another base. An argument evolves between base commander Colonel Jessup and his officers: while Jessup's executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel Markinson, advocates that Santiago be transferred immediately, Jessup regards this as akin to surrender and orders Santiago's commanding officer, Lieutenant Kendrick, to train Santiago into a better Marine.
When Dawson and Downey are later arrested for Santiago's murder, naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway suspects that they carried out a "code red" order, a violent extrajudicial punishment. Galloway asks to defend them, but instead the case is given to Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee, an inexperienced and unenthusiastic U.S. Navy lawyer. There is initial friction between Galloway, who resents Kaffee's tendency to plea bargain, and Kaffee, who resents Galloway's interference. Kaffee and the prosecutor, his friend Captain Jack Ross, negotiate a bargain, but Dawson and Downey refuse to go along. They insist that they were ordered by Lieutenant Kendrick to shave Santiago's head, minutes after Kendrick publicly ordered the platoon not to touch the would-be victim, and did not intend their victim to die. Kaffee is finally won over by Galloway and takes the case to court.
In the course of the trial, the defense manages to establish the existence of "code red" orders at Guantanamo and that Dawson specifically had learned not to disobey any order, having been denied a promotion after helping out a fellow Marine who was under what could be seen as a "code red". However, the defense also suffers setbacks when a cross-examination reveals that Private Downey wasn't actually present when he and Dawson supposedly received the "code red" order. Lieutenant Colonel Markinson reveals to Kaffee that Jessup never intended to transfer Santiago off the base but commits suicide rather than testify in court.
Without Markinson's testimony, Kaffee believes the case lost and returns home in a drunken stupor, having come to regret that he fought the case instead of arranging a plea bargain. Galloway, however, convinces Kaffee to call Colonel Jessup as a witness despite the risk of being court-martialled for smearing a high-ranking officer. Jessup initially outsmarts Kaffee's questioning but is unnerved when the lawyer points out a contradiction in his testimony; Jessup had stated that he wanted to transfer Santiago off the base for his own safety but if he ordered his men to leave Santiago alone and if Marines always obey orders, Santiago would have been in no danger. Under heavy pressure from Kaffee and unnerved by being caught in one of his own lies, Jessup finally snaps, extols his own importance to national security and ultimately confesses to ordering the "code red". As he angrily justifies his actions, Jessup is arrested.
Soon afterwards, Dawson and Downey are cleared of the murder charge but found guilty of "conduct unbecoming a United States Marine" and dishonorably discharged. Dawson accepts the verdict but Downey does not understand what they had done wrong. Dawson explains that they had failed to stand up for those too weak to fight for themselves, like Santiago. As the two prepare to leave, Kaffee tells Dawson he does not need a patch on his arm to have honor. Dawson, who had previously been reluctant to respect Kaffee as an officer, barks, "Ten hut! There's an officer on deck!" and salutes Kaffee.
Production.
Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin got the inspiration to write the source play, a courtroom drama called "A Few Good Men," from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah, who had graduated from Boston University Law School and signed up for a three-year stint with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps. She was going to Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre on Broadway. He and his roommates had purchased a Macintosh 512K, so when he returned home he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for "A Few Good Men."
In 1988 Sorkin sold the film rights for his play "A Few Good Men" to producer David Brown before it premiered, in a deal reportedly "well into six figures." Brown had read an article in "The New York Times" about Sorkin's one-act play "Hidden in This Picture," and he found out Sorkin also had a play called "A Few Good Men" that was having Off-Broadway readings.
William Goldman did an un-credited rewrite of the script that Sorkin liked so much, he incorporated the changes made into the stage version.
Brown was producing a few projects at TriStar Pictures, and he tried to interest them in making "A Few Good Men" into a film, but his proposal was declined due to the lack of star actor involvement. Brown later got a call from Alan Horn at Castle Rock Entertainment who was anxious to make the film. Rob Reiner, a producing partner at Castle Rock, opted to direct it.
The film had a production budget of $33,000,000.
Nicholson would later comment of the $5 million he received for his role, "It was one of the few times when it was money well spent."
The film starts with a recital of "Semper Fidelis" by a U.S. Marine Corps marching band, and a Silent Drill (performed by the Texas A&M University Corps of Cadets Fish Drill Team).
Several former Navy JAG lawyers have been identified as the basis for Tom Cruise's character Lt. Daniel Kaffee. These include Don Marcari (now an attorney in Virginia), former U.S. Attorney David Iglesias, Chris Johnson (now practicing in California) and Walter Bansley III (now practicing in Connecticut.) However in a September 15, 2011 article of "The New York Times", Sorkin was quoted as saying, “The character of Dan Kaffee in "A Few Good Men" is entirely fictional and was not inspired by any particular individual.”
Wolfgang Bodison was a film location scout when he was asked to take part in a screen test for the part of Dawson.
Awards and honors.
Academy Awards nominations.
The film was nominated for four Academy Awards:
Golden Globe nominations.
The film was nominated for five Golden Globe Awards:
AFI 100 Years… series.
The film was recognized twice by the AFI 100 Years... series.
In 2005, Nicholson's reading of the line "You can't handle the truth!" was voted the twenty-ninth greatest American film quote of all time and in 2008 the film was voted the fifth best Courtroom Drama.
Reception.
The film opened on December 11, 1992 in 1,925 theaters. It grossed $15,517,468 in its first weekend and was the number one film at the box office for the next 3 weeks. Overall it grossed $141,340,178 in the U.S. and $95,159,822 in International markets, giving a total of $236,500,000.
The film was a big success, both with critics and at the box office.
Peter Travers of "Rolling Stone" magazine said "That the performances are uniformly outstanding is a tribute to Rob Reiner ("Misery"), who directs with masterly assurance, fusing suspense and character to create a movie that literally vibrates with energy." Richard Schickel in "Time" magazine called it "an extraordinarily well-made movie, which wastes no words or images in telling a conventional but compelling story." Todd McCarthy in "Variety" magazine predicted, "The same histrionic fireworks that gripped theater audiences will prove even more compelling to filmgoers due to the star power and dramatic screw-tightening." The film has an 81% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes.

<doc id="20691950" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20691950" title="Goods station">
Goods station

A goods station (also known as a goods yard, goods depot or freight station) is, in the widest sense, a railway station which is exclusively or predominantly where goods (or freight) of any description are loaded or unloaded from ships or road vehicles and/or where goods wagons are transferred to local sidings.
A station where goods are not specifically received or dispatched, but simply transferred on their way to their destination between the railway and another means of transport, such as ships or lorries, may be referred to as a transshipment station. This often takes the form of a container terminal and may also be known as a container station. 
Location.
Goods stations may be located: 
Where individual goods wagons are dispatched to specific goods stations, they are usually delivered to special shunting stations or marshalling yards where they are sorted and then collected. Sometimes there are combined shunting and goods stations.
Equipment.
A goods station is usually equipped with a large number of storage and loading sidings in order to fulfil its task. On the loading sidings there may be fixed facilities, such as cranes or conveyor belts, or temporary equipment, such as wheeled ramps for the loading of sugar beet.
Stations where the primary purpose of the station is the handling of containers are also known as container terminals (CT). They are equipped with special cranes and fork-lift vehicles for loading containers from lorries or ships onto the railway vehicles, or vice-versa.
If only a small section of a station is used for the loading and unloading of goods, it may be referred to as the "loading area" or "loading dock" and has its own access and signposting. Often there are no facilities for loading and the individual firm has to organise its own loading equipment such as conveyor belts or lorry cranes.
Such loading areas were mainly to be found on branch lines, narrow gauge railways and at smaller stations.
Medium-sized and larger goods stations usually have marshalling or shunting sidings to enable trains to be divided amongst the various local loading and sorting sidings and industrial branches, at the same time performing the function of a small railway hub. In many European countries they are also equipped with a hump yard.
Changing nature of goods stations.
Due to the increasing amount of goods traffic that has switched from rail to road many goods stations and, in consequence marshalling yards, closed and were often eventually demolished, so that reviving rail services at the same location is no longer possible. In combined goods and hub stations with a hump yard, the latter was closed if the station lost its role as a railway hub, whilst the local goods function was retained. In addition, in most countries, part-load or parcel goods services have been entirely transferred to the roads, which has led to the closure of goods sheds as well as most of the public loading sidings and ramps used by smaller customers. As a result, most of the remaining goods stations today are just used as container or transshipment stations. 
European terminology.
In German-speaking countries, various terms for goods station are used including "Güterbahnhof" in Germany (abb: "Gbf") and Switzerland (abb: "GB"), "Frachtenbahnhof" ("Fbf") in Austria; "Umschlagbahnhof" (Ubf) for transshipment station and "Containerbahnhof" or "Containerterminal" ("CT") for container station or terminal.

Ringo, I Love You

"Ringo, I Love You" is a rock song performed by American singer-actress Cher released under the pseudonym Bonnie Jo Mason, the name she used at the start of her career when based in Los Angeles. The song was released in 1964 during the height of Beatlemania. The original vinyl is now a valuable rarity. In 1999 the song was covered by German electronic duo Stereo Total and released on their studio album "My Melody".
Song information.
"Ringo, I Love You" is the first solo song recorded by Cher. The single was released under the name of Bonnie Jo Mason because producer Phil Spector wanted American names for his singers, and Cherilyn La Piere wasn't a name he considered sufficiently American. The single failed to chart nationally, and did not pick up much local radio play, although it was a minor hit in Buffalo, New York. It has been suggested that many radio stations wouldn't consider playing the record because they thought Cher's extremely low vocals were a man's vocals, although the artist's female moniker and the fact that the singer explicitly identifies herself as a girl in the song makes this story open to question. The track does not have Spector's usual Wall of Sound production techniques, instead featuring more of a crudely arranged "beat group" sound. Spector, if he did indeed produce the track, took no producer credit, and the record did not appear on Philles Records, Spector's usual label. 
"Beatle Blues" is on the single's B-side, a typical tossed-off Spector instrumental made so that the A-side would get all the attention. "Ringo, I Love You" has been released on compact disc on small indie record label, although not on Cher releases. Such a cd is "Girls in the Garage (Volume 4)", "Flabby Road" and "Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Rock & Roll (Volume 1)".

Pudhu Pudhu Arthangal

Puthu Puthu Arthangal (; ) is a 1989 Indian Tamil language Drama film directed by K. Balachander starring Rahman, Sithara, Geetha, Janagaraj, Jayachitra, Poornam Vishwanathan, Sowcar Janaki, Vivek and Ilaiyaraaja.
__TOC__
Plot.
This refreshing tale from K. Balachander focuses on the fairly realistic tale of a famous singer Bharathi (Rahman with singing by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam) and his extremely possessive wife named Gowri (Geetha). Tricked into marriage by his convincing mother-in-law, what really irks Bharathi is his wife’s inability to deal with his rabid female fans. Tensions escalate until Bharathi flees from home and ends up encountering someone else named Jyothi (Sithara) who’s also escaping from her life as a dancer because her husband made her dance forcefully and tried forcing her to be a prostitute.
Geetha’s character is surprisingly well-defined. As a rabid fan who gets to marry the object of her desires, she is obviously afraid her husband will cheat on her with one of the thousands of women throwing themselves at him – after all, he slept with them before their marriage. Geetha turns in a convincing performance as a woman whose all-consuming love ends up consuming her. Rahman, who sounds suspiciously like ‘Nizhagal’ Ravi, also does well as the famous singer – but a tiny quibble with the story: he goes to work in a restaurant in North India serving South Indian cuisine, and none of the customers recognize the famous singer. Then, he makes a living in Goa with Jyothi, meet one Malayali couple, who died later in the movie and are both fluent in Hindi, and by watching the couple,they learn the true definition for love while falling in love themselves. 
Then Bharathi get a prank call from his PA that Gowri is ill. So he comes back with Jyothi from Goa, which makes Gowri angry and she doesn't let Jyothi in without knowing who she is. Bharathi gets angry and they stay in another one of his houses. Bharathi gets so angry that he claims that he loves Jyothi and that she cannot go because of her problems. So Gowri files for a divroce, informs news reporters about Jyothi. Jyothi's husband appears later in the story. Gowri plans to get married to a cricket player Guru. Guru had proposed to her in the past. He accepts the proposal and abandons one of his fans, Yamuna, who is obsessed with him. Later, Yamuna commits suicide in the marriage hall readied for Gowri's marriage. Gowri's mother and her PA feel that she is mentally unstable. Her mother begs Bharathi to go and see her in the hospital and he goes with Jyothi to see her. Jyothi then sees that Bharathi and Gowri belong to each other. Jyothi later finds her husband, who was indeed in love with her. After that, Bharathi goes to recording with him being happy and visits his wife in the hospital while enjoying himself.
Remake.
Puthu Puthu Arthangal was remade in Hindi, but never got released. The film had title as Dilon Ka Rista starred Rahul Roy, Anu Agarwal and Ashwini Bhave had music by Bappi Lahiri and was directed by K.Balachander.
Soundtrack.
The music composed by Ilaiyaraaja.

Demonsbane

Demonsbane is an e-book and the first novel of the Diablo series. It was written by Robert B. Marks.
It appears in print in the "Diablo Archive".
Description.
Siggard—the only survivor of the battle of Entsteig, unable to remember the battle's final hours—is driven to avenge those slain by the army of darkness. As he hunts the demonic army, Siggard pieces together the truth of that terrible battle...and finds his nightmare is just beginning.
Development.
"Demonsbane" was a book published in the spirit of the "e-book revolution." However, the market for e-books was quite small at the time and despite months of advertising on battle.net, sales were in the hundreds rather than the projected thousands.
Before being written, it was decided that "Demonsbane" should set the tone for the series, and help establish Sanctuary not only as a living and breathing game world, but also as a living and breathing world in literature. As such, Marks did a lot of world building using flavour quotes at the beginning of each chapter.

118 Squadron (Israel)

The 118 Squadron of the Israeli Air Force, also known as the Nocturnal Birds of Prey Squadron, is a helicopter squadron of CH-53-2000 Sea Stallions based at Tel Nof Airbase.
2010 crash in Romania.
On 26 July 2010 a 118 Squadron Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion "Yas'ur" helicopter crashed during a training flight at high altitude in the Carpathian mountains, near the city of Brasov in Romania. All onboard died, four Israeli pilots, two Israeli mechanics and one Romanian officer.
After an agreement was signed in 2003, early in 2004 the Israeli Air Force began cooperation with several air forces of the European armies. As part of the cooperation agreements the Israeli air force is permitted to train in various foreign air spaces. In this way, these agreements opened the possibility for the Israeli air force to practice in complex conditions which are not available in Israel. Initially the training was mostly based in Turkey and over the Black Sea, but later, the training expanded to various countries in Europe. The cooperation agreement between Israel and Romania was signed in September 2003 between the IAF Corps Commander Major General Dan Halutz, and the commander of the Romanian Air Force Major General Gheorghe Catrina.
On 18 July 2010 a joint training of the Israeli Air Force and Romanian Air Force, began in which Yasur helicopters from 118 Squadron were used. The helicopter contained an observer on behalf of the Romanian Air Force, a pair of Israeli pilots, a couple of Israeli mechanics, and another set of Israeli pilots who were replace the first set of pilots during the exercise.
On 26 July 2010 at 13:15 two Yasur helicopters took off from the Romanian Air Force Base in Boboc and headed north toward the Carpathian mountains. The fog which prevailed at the flight altitude made it difficult to navigate the helicopter.
At around 15:20 the two helicopters went to an altitude of 6200 feet towards a mountain which was in front of them with the aim of passing it, entering heavy fog. Due to the heavy fog, one of the helicopters did not see the edge of the mountain which was to his left, and when he turned left he crashed into the mountain and caught on fire.
Six Israeli serviceman and one Romanian liaison officer were killed in the accident.
Initial reports over the loss of contact with the CH-53 helicopter were received in the Israeli Air Force headquarters around 17:00 pm (Israeli time), and as a result a gag order was issued in Israel over releasing information regarding the accident in the Israeli media – in order that the IDF would be able to personally contact and inform the families of the deceased, before they heard about it in the media. Although initially the Israeli media did not report the accident, the Internet was flooded with information about the accident in international news websites, blogs and social networks.
Immediately after learning of the accident the Air Force Commander Maj. Gen. Ido Nehoshtan appointed a rescue delegation, headed by Brigadier-General Jacob Shaharabani. Soon thereafter they left Israel towards Romania, and included members of the rabbinate, medical professionals, and about 30 soldiers from the Israeli heliborne medevac extraction unit Unit 669.
After arriving near the site of the crash, the Israeli delegation had to climb up to the site of the crash, had search for the fatalities and later on had to extricate them from the site in order to confirm their identification and to bring them to a proper burial.
As a result of the accident, the Israeli Air Force Commander ordered a halt to all Force training flights for one day. Following the accident, the joint training exercise was discontinued and all Israeli participants and Israeli aircraft were returned to Israel.
The Israeli media noted that despite the seniority of the IAF Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion "Yas'ur" helicopters, the helicopters were recently upgraded, both in terms of systems and in terms of technical care, as part of the "Yas'ur 2025" program aimed at having the Sikorsky CH-53 helicopters remain in service up till 2025.
At noon of 27 July 2010, the Romanian Defense Ministry officially announced in the media that 7 bodies were found, and that there were no survivors in the accident.
Around midnight of 27 July 2010 the Romanian army discover the helicopter's black box. The Romanian troops sent a photo of the black box to the IDF, which confirmed that it was the actual black box of the helicopter. Israeli Air Force officials confirmed that Israel would investigate the black box.
After the accident, officials in the Israeli Air Force requested the Romanian Air Force to bring the remains of the helicopter back to Israel in order that the Israeli Army could carry out a full investigation of the event.
The Romanian and Israeli military aviation commanders decided to collaborate in raising a memorial at the site of the crash.
Seven months after the accident, Israel decided that the widow of the Romanian captain, who was killed in an accident, be given the status of a "widow of the Israeli army", and as such she would be granted a monthly pension from the Israeli Defense Ministry. In addition, it was decided that a special fund would be opened for her baby which would include an initial fund of 20,000 dollars.

Ray Jordon

Raymond Clarence "Slug" Jordon (17 February 1937 – 13 August 2012) was an Australian first-class cricketer who represented Victoria in the Sheffield Shield and toured with the Australian national cricket team. He was also a successful Australian rules football coach and acted as both reserves and under-19s coach at various clubs in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
Universally known as "Slug", his nickname arose as a result of an incident during his National Service at Puckapunyal.
Career.
Jordon took a total of 230 dismissals in the Sheffield Shield and 283 for all first-class matches. His tally at both Shield and first-class level remained a Victorian record until surpassed by his replacement Richie Robinson, who himself was later bettered by Darren Berry. In 1970/71 he managed a career best ten dismissals in a match against South Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
His only first-class hundred was an innings of 134, also against South Australia, in the 1963/64 Sheffield Shield. The South Australian bowling attack was led by Gary Sobers and while he ran through Victoria's batting lineup with six second innings wickets, Jordon resisted with a century before falling LBW to Neil Hawke.
The wicket-keeper captained Victoria in five Sheffield Shield matches during his career, three of them in the 1968/69 season.
Jordon came close to playing Test cricket, touring both India and South Africa in 1969/70 as a standby for Brian Taber. Although he appeared in four of Australia's first-class warm up matches in India and six in South Africa, Jordon was not required for any of the Tests.
According to Ashley Mallett's biography of Ian Chappell, "Chappelli Speaks Out", Bill Lawry was considering selecting Jordon to play in the fourth test instead of Taber because of the former's superior batting. Chappell said he would not play in the side if Jordon was picked because the wicketkeeper was a cheat. This was based on an incident during a game on the recent Indian tour when Australia was playing South Zone. E. A. S. Prasanna was facing Alan Connolly with Jordon standing up to the stumps – he appeared to miss the ball and his off stump was knocked forward. Jordon appealed and Prasanna eventually walked but Chappell believed the ball had missed Prasanna's stumps and rebounded off Jordon's pads to break the wicket – and that Jordon knew this.
Football.
During his early sporting years, Jordon was also an Australian rules football player, and he appeared in 96 matches for the Coburg Football Club in the Victorian Football Association, also serving as captain at the club for a time. He was a highly regarded player, and several Victorian Football League clubs were interested in recruiting him, but he retired from playing in 1962 to concentrate on cricket.
He was later a higher successful minor grade coach. Jordon led clubs at under-19 and reserve level and is credited as having coached eleven premiership teams. Nicknamed "The Slug" and known for his colourful language, Jordon had particular success with Melbourne and Richmond's under-19s. While he was in charge of the reserves at North Melbourne he was called up to coach the seniors for a Victorian Football League game in 1976 because Ron Barassi was unavailable.

Amit Trivedi

Amit Trivedi is an Indian film composer, musician, singer and lyricist, working in Bollywood. After working as a theatre and jingle composer and composing for non-film albums, he debuted as a film composer in the 2008 Hindi film "Aamir", and shot to fame in the Hindi film music scene with his critically acclaimed work in the more popular "Dev.D" (2009), which earned him several accolades, including the 2010 National Film Award for Best Music Direction for "Dev.D".
Early life.
Trivedi was born in Bandra, Mumbai in India to a Gujarati family.
Career.
In his younger days, an electronic musical instrument fascinated Trivedi and he was slowly drawn towards music, mainly influenced by classical music. At 19–20, he began composing music. In college days joined the band Om, who performed at local gigs, small shows and live performances. They struck gold when Times Music took notice at one of their shows, and offered to launch their album. The album however did not fare well, due to lack of promotion. Eventually Trivedi went on to compose for theatre (Hindi, English and Gujarati plays), background music for television shows, live performances, dandiya shows, orchestras etc. He also had a brief stint composing advertisement jingles, for brands such as McDonalds and Airtel. After sound engineer and Audio Garage Recording Studio owner Arvind Vishwakarma introduced Trivedi to Sony BMG, he began composing music for non-film albums. As a part of his two-year contract, Trivedi composed some tracks for Abhijeet Sawant's "Junoon" and one song in Prashant Tamang's debut album.He arranged for many musician including Amartya Rahut for a marathi movie Uttarayan in 2004.
Film music eventually came his way, when friend and playback singer Shilpa Rao suggested his name to film director Anurag Kashyap. The latter was in search of a new composer with a distinct vision for his next film. After meeting Trivedi, Kashyap offered him the chance to compose the soundtrack to "Dev.D". Although it was scheduled to be his debut, "Dev.D" ran into production delays and was shelved for some time.Dev D's music got critical acclaimation
Upon Kashyap's recommendation, Trivedi was roped in to score Raj Kumar Gupta's directorial venture "Aamir". Trivedi and Gupta worked on making the soundtrack fuse with the film narrative, resulting in an effort that garnered critical recognition.
By the end of 2008, "Dev.D" was finally released. The soundtrack, released in December, consisted of 18 tracks of different genres. Trivedi dubbed the soundtrack the "baap of different genres". He sang five songs on the soundtrack, and wrote the lyrics for one ("Aankh Micholi"). He shot to fame with the unusual music of "Dev. D", giving many chart-busters like "Emosanal Attyachar", "Saali Khushi", "O Pardesi" and many more. He was conferred with both the R. D. Burman Award and the Best Background Score at the Filmfare Awards 2010, before receiving the National Film Award for Best Music Direction, the highest recognition for Indian composers. Trivedi wrote the score for the 2009 Hindi Film, "Wake Up Sid" and one of his compositions "Iktaara" was also included in the soundtrack. In 2009 itself, Trivedi was roped in by Anshu Sharma a.ka. Banaa (Creative Director from Rediffusion Y&R) to compose the team anthem "Game for More" for Royal Challengers Bangalore which is a team owned by liquor baron Vijay Mallya. Between scoring for films, Trivedi also wrote the title track for the reality show "Big Switch" aired on UTV Bindaas.
Music Characteristics.
Music provided by Amit Trivedi has always been different in tone & perspective. He has often collaborated with lyricist Amitabh Bhattacharya who is known for his profound control of Hindi and Urdu as well as various folk languages. He often sings various of his compositions and is known for his distinct edgy/rustic voice. In one of his interviews, he stated that he never received formal training in singing and sings what sounds good to him.trivedi's music has a refined sense of instrumentation and follows a more varied range of orchestrated music.He often experiments with his music style changing aspects of the musical tune simultaneously in order to establish a different phase of soundtrack genre.
Live Performance.
Amit Trivedi did his first live concert at Mood Indigo (IIT Bombay's annual cultural festival), on 23 December 2010. The concert also witnessed Tochi Raina, Amitabh Bhattacharya, Kavita Seth, Nikhil D'Souza, Raja Hasan, Aditi Singh Sharma and Sriram Iyer performing with him.

Our Lady of the Sacred Heart College, Sydney

Our Lady of the Sacred Heart College is a Catholic secondary College for girls, founded in 1897 by the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, members of a religious congregation founded by Father Jules Chevalier in France in 1874, and located in the Sydney suburb of Kensington.
History and description.
The College was moved to the Kensington site in 1913 and until 1995 was administered by the Sisters. It is part of the system of schools under the auspices of the Catholic Education Office in the Sydney Archdiocese.
At its opening, the college was an impoverished Catholic school, with little to no support from the government. As a result, the schools oldest structure, the Fyfe Wing, was not completed immediately, and construction stalled during 1914 when funds dried up. In 1915, a Franciscan Monk by the name of Friar Tony Macfarlane was assigned to teach Mathematics and Science at the school. Friar Tony Macfarlane had a strong background in Carpentry and a brief career as a Civil Engineer prior to taking his vows as a monk. Friar Macfarlane took upon himself to complete the construction of the schools main building, in an effort to remove classes from the OLSH convent next door. The OLSH nuns were involved in admin and some minor laboring work, with many parishioners volunteering their knowledge and labour time to help. With this means of completion, the Fyfe Wing was listed as a heritage site in 1984. Every year, the school celebrates this achievement on the Feast of St Francis. The school holds a bake sale, with all proceeds going to missionaries in Papua New Guinea and housing projects in the Northern Territory.
The college's present location in Kensington makes it accessible from the city and close to the University of NSW. It draws most of its students from the immediate local area and from Brighton-Le-Sands/Sans Souci. It is surrounded by excellent community resources and leisure facilities. 
The campus is adjacent to the OLSH Provincial House, OLSH Convent and St Joseph's Aged Care Facility. It is near the MSC Monastery, Chevalier Resource Centre, and the parish church and primary college of Our Lady of the Rosary. Regular bus services from all areas run to the College.

Charles Holloway James

Charles Holloway James R.A., F.R.I.B.A., (1893-1953), architect, specialised in designs for homes and housing projects, but also completed large public works, particularly in collaboration with Stephen Rowland Pierce.
Both Hennell and James had worked at Letchworth, and much of their early work together was at Welwyn Garden City. They were also responsible for Swanpool Garden Suburb, Lincoln; government subsidy houses in Thorpe Bay, Essex; and the layout and design of housing schemes in other parts of the country. After Hennell’s death much of James’s work was done at Hampstead Garden Suburb, including his own house and several on a larger scale.
In partnership with Stephen Rowland Pierce, F.R.I.B.A., James won competitions for three public buildings. Of these the most important was the City Hall, Norwich, on an elevated site between the ancient Guildhall and the Church of St. Peter Mancroft above the market place. A building on a grand scale, it combines James's neo-Georgian architecture with a reference to the then fashionable Swedish movement and the tower of Stockholm City Hall at Ostberg.
Norwich City Hall is the most important of the public buildings by James, but the most characteristic is the Hertford County Building. Here he was most in sympathy with the Georgian architecture of the county. He also designed the municipal buildings at Slough, a library for the National Book League, and made additions to All Souls College, Oxford.
James, active despite his war injury, was described as a tall man with soft, flexible, and rather boyish features, giving the impression of great sensibility. He had a good deal of quiet humour, affecting a robust attitude to life that contrasted with his appearance. He became A.R.I.B.A. in 1918 and F.R.I.B.A. in 1926, and served as R.I.B.A. vice president 1947-8. He was elected A.R.A. in 1937 and R.A. in 1946, and won the London Architecture bronze medal in 1949.
He married, in 1922, the designer Margaret Calkin James.

Ship-to-ship cargo transfer

A ship-to-ship (STS) transfer operation is the transfer of cargo between seagoing ships positioned alongside each other, either while stationary or underway. Cargoes typically transferred via STS methods include crude oil, liquefied gas (LPG or LNG), bulk cargo, and petroleum products. The nomenclature STS transfer should be used in reference to techniques used by civilian merchant vessels, as differentiated from underway replenishment which is the term used by the US Navy for similar, but usually far more complicated, operations between naval vessels while underway.
Most of cargo operations take place between a ship and a land-based terminal. Nevertheless it sometimes can be useful to transfer cargo from one ship to another in the open sea and this is called a ship-to-ship operation. One vessell will act as the terminal whilst the other one will moor. The receiving ship is called the mother vessel.
Problems.
It is not easy to close two moving objects smoothly. Therefore seafarers established a few procedures which will be used regarding the sizes and manoeuvrability's of the vessels involved.
We can consider three configurations
The table below show the required manoeuvre regarding the operation for a few vessels
Mother vessel stopped.
When the manoeuvrability of the berthing vessel is not really high it is often less dangerous for her to approach a vessel stopped in the water. Like that there will be a protected side from the waves and the wind and there will also not be any bow wave. At that moment the vessel approaches on the quarter of the mother ship and get on a parallel heading at slow speed.In that case an artificial type wave can be created which can prevent the ship from stopping.
Vessels making way, tactful approach.
It is of huge importance to maintain the heading of the “terminal” and this is not possible with stopped vessels. That's why we will not consider a static reference system but one in translation because a ship needs some speed to maintain her heading.
The biggest vessel will act has a terminal heading on a steady course at manoeuvring speed. Then the second ship will come closer in the same direction but a bit faster. When the vessels are navigating side to side, they can be moored. First of all, the spring lines will be tensioned to maintain the vessels at the same speed. Then the breast lines will keep the vessels as close as possible. It is also possible to add head and stern lines to prevent any longitudinal motion.
Regulations.
These operations are carried out in accordance with guidelines set out by the Oil Companies International Marine Forum and the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), with the strictest adherence to safety regulations.
According to International Maritime Organization regulations vessels transferring OIL CARGO must have an approved STS operational manual that describes the procedure. These manuals should be available on board not later than first annual, intermediate or special survey after 1 January 2011. These manuals can be prepared either by the shipping company or external consultants.

Port Victoria P.V.1

The Port Victoria P.V.1 was a British prototype floatplane fighter of the First World War, built at the Royal Naval Air Service's Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot on the Isle of Grain by fitting a Sopwith Baby with high-lift wings. Only a single aircraft was built, with the type not being chosen for production.
Design and development.
Squadron-Commander J.W.Seddon RN, officer commanding of the Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot, realised that high-lift wings, as described by the National Physical Laboratory in 1916, had the potential to improve the lifting capacity of the Sopwith Baby seaplane. He instructed the Depot's "Experimental Construction Depot" to make and fit such wings to a Sopwith Baby, the resulting aircraft being named the P.V.1. 
The new wings had the same area as the thinner aerofoils used on the "Baby" but were mounted with greater stagger; larger floats were also fitted. The thicker wings, heavier floats and additional 300 lb. (136 kg) ballast added a total of 600 lb. (272 kg) to the weight of the "Baby", but the P.V.1 was still able to reach a height of 8,000 ft. (2,438 m) and achieve a speed of 67 kt (77 mph, 124 km/h).
While it successfully demonstrated the performance of the new high-lift wings, the Fairey Hamble Baby was placed in production instead.
The P.V.1 was retained by the Depot for test operation, including the investigation of the catapult launching of aircraft.

Sigurd Swane (16 June 1879 – 9 April 1973) was a Danish painter and writer. 
Swane was born in Frederiksberg. He studied in Copenhagen at the Royal Danish Academy of Art. 
While in Paris in 1907, he was influenced by the work of the Fauves. On returning to Denmark, he painted a series of woodlands using greens, yellows and blues. His use of spots was soon replaced by more solid brushstrokes, with careful separation of colour, making him one of Denmark's foremost colourists. 
His portraits are typified by wooded backgrounds as can be seen in the paintings of his brother Leo Swane (1908) and of Harald Giersing (1908). 
He finally fulfilled his childhood dream of living in the country on a farm in Odsherred in the north-west of Zealand where he completed a series of light-filled landscape paintings. From 1947 he often painted in Portugal. He died, aged 93, in Grevinge.
His wife Christine Swane was also a painter, as was their son Lars Swane.

Sukranagar is a village development committee in Chitwan District in the Narayani Zone of southern Nepal. At the time of the 1991 Nepal census it had a population of 6750 people living in 1128 individual households. By 2009, the population has exceeded 30,000.
Located just across Nepal's Chitwan National Park, Sukranagar is home to subsistence farmers who nominally live off the land using traditional farming practices. Being in the proximity of the national park, farmers here traditionally had a close relationship with the National Park. This relationship also invited some illegal transactions of forest products and livestock grazing in the park, and illegal hunting and fishing, all despised by the conservation authorities. Similarly crop damage by wild animals from the park have become a matter of concern for the local people. In various ways, there has been a reciprocal relationship between the park and local people. The people settled adjacent to the park are dependent on its resources primarily due to absence of convenient alternatives. This means that there is a tremendous opportunity for thoughtful and resourceful people to develop alternative economic and agricultural practices that can positively exploit the proximity of the park and the rich combination of plants and animals that exist in the park. There is an opportunity for conservation, environmental safeguard, and economic activities.

Stephen Rowland Pierce

Stephen Rowland Pierce F.R.I.B.A, F.S.A. (1896-1966) was an architect and town planning consultant. In partnership with Charles Holloway James he designed several large British public buildings, including Norwich City Hall. 
In 1921, Pierce won the British Prix de Rome in Architecture of the British School at Rome, and afterwards became a member of the Faculty of Architecture. Elected A.R.I.B.A. in 1929 and F.R.I.B.A. in 1938, he was council’s critic for the R.I.B.A. prizes and studentships, joint secretary of the R.I.B.A. exhibition committee and assessor in competitions conducted by the Institute. From 1936 to 1942 Pierce was director of architectural studies at the Hastings School of Art.
The most important building on which Pierce and Charles Holloway James were engaged was the City Hall at Norwich, the commission for which they won in open competition. The designs were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1933 and 1934, and the City Hall was completed and opened by King George VI in October, 1938. Standing in a commanding position above the market place, the Norwich municipal offices have been described as one of the most satisfying civic buildings in the country, dignified in general form and interesting in details. A slightly Swedish flavour dates the building as belonging to the period between the wars.
Other civic buildings in which Pierce had a hand were the Hertford County Hall (1940) and the town hall at Slough (1936).
From 1941 to 1942, Pierce was lecturer at the School of Architecture at Manchester University. He served as a town planning consultant to Malta, Norwich, Leamington Spa, Southampton, among other towns, He was a member of the Council and Vice-President R.I.B.A. from 1951-55.

Church of St. Michael the Archangel, Shalfleet

The Church of St. Michael the Archangel, Shalfleet is a parish church in the Church of England located in Shalfleet, Isle of Wight.
History.
The church is medieval. 
The dedication to St. Michael was made in 1964 as the previous dedication had been lost. 
It has a tower that was built in 1070. It originally had no ground level door, and the entrance was through a door on the roof. Parishioners had to access the room by climbing a ladder. The walls of the church are five feet thick and it was a refuge for residents during attacks by the French who had sailed up Newtown Creek. A "3 pound" parish gun which was inscribed 'Schawflet' was kept in the tower until 1779. 
The church had a steeple that was added around 1800, but the steeple was determined to be unstable and it was removed in 1912. The money for the steeple was raised by selling the parish gun and the church bells. This resulted in a local rhyme:
In 1889 the plaster was removed from ceiling and walls—the latter a questionable proceeding—the tower arch unblocked, a new door cut through the north face and the east window of the aisle reconstructed.
The church is fortunate in having escaped late additions and thus remaining an excellent example, with the exception of the tower, of late 13th-century work. The entry is by the north door, bearing the date 1754 on its inner face, through the 12th-century opening with its primitive carved tympanum. The north wall is practically modern work, partly rebuilt on the old foundation and of the same thickness in 1812, when wooden mullioned windows with brick reveals took the place of what may have been 15th-century lights. The insertion of the wide arch in the 13th century, practically cutting away the whole eastern face of the tower at this stage, has resulted in a serious subsidence to the north and east, with a corresponding contortion of the arch. When this was blocked as a precautionary measure there is nothing to show, but its opening in 1889 and the cutting of a door in the northern face of the tower was an unwise and risky proceeding, probably resulting in the serious crack in the upper part of the north-east angle. 
A noticeable feature in the church is that the floor slopes down gradually to the east end without a break at the chancel arch.
The two bells in the tower are inscribed 'May all whom I shall summon to the grave, The ransom of a well-spent life receive. Thos. Way, James Street, Churchwardens, 1815. T. Mears of London fecit.' The smaller bell has only the names of the churchwardens, J. Jolliffe and J. Cooper, and the date 1807.

HMS Menelaus (1810)

HMS "Menelaus" was a Royal Navy 38-gun fifth rate frigate, launched in 1810 at Plymouth.
Career.
"Menelaus" entered service in 1810 under the command of Captain Peter Parker, and within weeks of commissioning was involved in the suppression of a mutiny aboard HMS "Africaine". The notoriously brutal Captain Robert Corbet had been appointed to command "Africaine" and the crew had protested and refused to allow him to board. The Admiralty sent three popular officers to negotiate with the crew and ordered "Menelaus" to come alongside. If the crew of "Africaine" refused to agree with the appointment of Corbet, Parker had been ordered to fire on the ship until they submitted. The crew eventually agreed to allow Corbet aboard and "Menelaus" was not needed. In the summer of 1810, Parker was ordered to sail for the Indian Ocean to reinforce the squadron operating against Île de France and participated in the capture of the island in December 1810.
In 1812, "Menelaus" was part of the blockade of Toulon in the Mediterranean and operated against coastal harbours, shipping and privateers off the southern coast of France with some success. In 1813, the frigate was transferred to the Atlantic for service convoying merchant ships to Canada in the War of 1812. "Menelaus" was subsequently employed in raiding American positions along the Maryland coastline, destroying a coastal convoy in September. In 1814, Parker was ordered to operate against French ships in the Atlantic and recaptured a valuable Spanish merchant ship in January.
Following the French surrender, "Menelaus" returned to service off the American seaboard. "Menelaus" 'was sent up the Chesapeake to divert the attention of the enemy in that quarter,' whilst General Ross's force was landed at Benedict. Thereafter, Peter Parker was killed at the Battle of Caulk's Field in Kent County, Maryland, on 30 August 1814. From 13 to 15 September, "Menelaus" was present at the Battle of Baltimore, with one of her complement, William Pritchard, being hospitalised after losing two fingers.
On 19 July 1815, "Menelaus" was in company with , , , "Ferret" and when they captured the French vessels "Fortune", "Papillon", "Marie Graty", "Marie Victorine", "Cannoniere", and "Printemps". The attack took place at Corrijou (Koréjou, east of Abervrach on the coast of Brittany), and during the action "Ferret" was able to prevent the escape of a French man-of-war brig that she forced ashore. Apparently, this cutting out expedition was the last of the war.
Later career and fate.
Following Parker's death, command passed to Edward Dix and he remained on the ship until she was laid up at Sheerness in 1818. In 1820 she moved to Chatham and in 1832 became a hospital ship, becoming the quarantine ship at Sandgate Street. She was eventually sold 87 years after her construction, in 1897.

Pope Paul VI's reform of the Roman Curia

Pope Paul VI's reform of the Roman Curia, in response to the altered needs of the Holy See and the Catholic Church as a whole, was achieved principally, but not solely, by his general reorganization of the Curia with the apostolic constitution "Regimini Ecclesiae universae" of 15 August 1967.
The Pope's aim, in effecting these changes, was to implement the desire expressed by the Second Vatican Council that the departments of the Roman Curia "be reorganized and better adapted to the needs of the times, regions, and rites especially as regards their number, name, competence and peculiar method of procedure, as well as the coordination of work among them."
Implementation of this desire led to numerous alterations in each of the fields that the Council indicated, as indicated in the following examples.
Number.
Some departments were suppressed, but the total number was increased, even before "Regimini Ecclesiae universae", by the creation of the Council of the Laity, the three Secretariats (that for Christian Unity, that for non-Christians and that for Dialogue with Non-Believers, the last of which has since been fused with the more recently founded Pontifical Council for Culture) and the Central Statistics Office.
New bodies (largely taking over functions previously carried out, sometimes in less coordinated form, by earlier bodies) were founded by the same apostolic constitution. They included two offices to manage and oversee financial affairs, the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See and the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See.
Pope Paul had already created on 6 January 1967 the Pontifical Commission "Iustitia et Pax", to which he added on 15 July 1971 the Pontifical Council "Cor Unum" under the same President.
Name.
The department formerly known as the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office became on 7 December 1965 the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, clearly indicating its field of competence. With "Regimini Ecclesiae universae", the Sacred Consistorial Congregation became the Sacred Congregation for Bishops (a less obscure indication of its field of competence), the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Church became the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Churches (recognizing the existence of several Eastern Catholic Churches, not just one – it was also raised in rank ahead of the Congregation for Bishops), the Sacred Congregation of the Council (i.e., the Council of Trent) became the Congregation for the Clergy (its field of competence), the Sacred Congregation of Religious became the Sacred Congregation for the Religious and Secular Institutes (making explicit its competence for institutes other than religious institutes in the strict sense), the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of the Faith became the Sacred Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (considered to be a better indication of its purpose), and the Sacred Congregation of Seminaries and Universities became the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education (reflecting a wider competence than indicated by its previous name).
Competence.
The altered names of departments indicated in some cases a change of competence.
The pre-existing Sacred Congregation of Rites was divided into two on 8 May1969 in accordance with its two distinct fields of competence. One part became the Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints, competent to deal with causes of beatification and canonization. The other became the Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship, which was later united with the existing Sacred Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments to form the Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. 
The competence of some offices had already been reduced to next to nothing. As a result, the Sacred Ceremonial Congregation and the Apostolic Datary were simply abolished with "Regimini Ecclesiae universae". The functions of the Apostolic Chancery, reduced by Pope Pius X in 1908 to little more than signing papal bulls were transferred in 1973 to the Cardinal Secretary of State.
The competence of the Sacred Roman Rota and the Apostolic Signatura was extended.
New departments for new fields of competence were established. They have been indicated above under the heading, "Number".
Procedure.
Originally, only cardinals were members of the congregations of the Curia. Pope Paul VI decreed that the members should be chosen also among bishops who were not cardinals. With "Regimini Ecclesiae universae" he laid down also that appointments whether of cardinals or of bishops to membership of congregations and even appointments to head departments would be for five-year periods only, but that renewed appointment for a further five-year period would also be possible. As before, the members of a congregation do not intervene in the day-to-day running of the congregation, which is in the hands of the Prefect and of the permanent staff, headed generally by the Secretary and the Undersecretary. Membership is thus open to bishops who rule distant dioceses, since normally they come together to discuss more general problems and to determine guidelines no more than once a year.
The permanent staff is to be of international provenance, chosen from people with suitable preparation and with pastoral experience. These have no claim on promotion to the highest positions.
Each congregation is to have consultors, who are appointed for five-year (renewable) periods.
Account must be taken of the wishes of the episcopal conferences.
The most widely known languages may be used, as well as Latin.
Pope Paul also laid down that on the death of a pope the posts of heads of departments would become vacant, with the exception of the posts of Cardinal Vicar for Rome, Camerlengo and Major Penitentiary. A new pope would thus be free to make his own choice of heads of departments.
Coordination.
Periodical meetings of the heads of departments can be called by the Cardinal Secretary of State with a view to coordinating activities, providing information and gathering suggestions.
Other meetings between officials of more than one departments are also held in accordance with needs. Meetings involving the Congregations for Bishops, for the Clergy, for Religious, and for Catholic Education are to held at fixed times to deal with questions concerning the clergy in general.

Randall Duell

Randall Duell (14 July 1903 – 28 November 1992) was an American architect and art director. Duell attended the University of Southern California School of Architecture and graduated in 1925. Joining the Los Angeles architectural firm Webber, Staunton and Spaulding, Duell contributed to designs for notable building projects in Southern California during the 1920s and 1930s, among them the Avalon Casino on Catalina Island, Frary Dining Hall and adjacent residence halls at Pomona College, and Green Acres, the estate of silent movie actor Harold Lloyd in Beverly Hills. He and architect Sumner Spaulding collaborated in the design of the Atkinson residence in Bel Air, which was modeled after the Petit Trianon. As construction declined during the Great Depression, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer hired Duell in 1936 to design the set of the Capulet home in Irving Thalberg's production of Romeo and Juliet. In 1937, he joined the MGM art department in a full-time capacity. During his career as a motion picture art director, he was nominated for three Academy Awards in the category Best Art Direction. He received screen credit for his work on 38 films, among them "Ninotchka" (1939), "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (1946), "Intruder in the Dust" (1949), and "Singin' in the Rain" (1952). Additionally he worked on a number of motion pictures without film credit, among them "The Wizard of Oz", 1939. He retired from MGM in 1959.
During much of his career at MGM, Duell maintained an outside architectural practice. Notable among his designs during this period is Casa de cadillac, a car dealership in Sherman Oaks built in 1948 which is now considered a prime example of Googie architecture. Following his departure from MGM in 1959, he joined Marco Engineering and collaborated with C.V. Wood in the design of Freedomland in the Bronx, the first of many theme parks he would design. The following year, he left Marco Engineering and established R. Duell and Associates, a Santa Monica-based architectural practice which specialized in the design of theme parks. Marrying traditional architecture with stagecraft, the firm designed most of the country's theme parks. The list of projects included Six Flags Over Texas, Arlington, TX; the Marriott's Great America parks in Gurnee, IL (now Six Flags Great America), and Santa Clara, CA (now California's Great America); the Universal Studios Tour, Universal City, CA; the Texas Pavilion at the 1964 World's Fair in New York; Magic Mountain, Valencia, California; Opryland, Nashville, TN; Astroworld, Houston, TX; and others. The Duell office employed the talents of a number of former motion picture art directors, among them Leroy Coleman, John de Cuir and Paul Gross.
He was born in Russell County, Kansas and died in Los Angeles, California.

Tom Sullivan (boxer)

Thomas Sullivan, also known as "Tommy" and "Irish Tommy" (January 1, 1922 South Boston, Massachusetts-December 23, 1957 South Boston) was an Irish-American professional light heavyweight boxer who was murdered by the Mullen Gang and Patriarca crime family.
Early life and background.
Thomas O'Suileabhain-Sullivan was born to a first generation Brittany-Irish emigrants Thomas and his mother simply identified as "Margaret (Mary) Sullivan" (1875–1957). It is unknown if that is her maiden name, or married name, as that is how she is identified in the newspaper articles concerning her son. Upon arriving to America his parents Thomas and Mary settled in South Boston. Thomas and Mary conceived two sons, Thomas, named after his paternal grandfather, not his father as is popular in American culture, following the old Gaelic-Celtic tradition. He had dirty blond hair and blue eyes. He had a younger brother also named Thomas after his paternal uncle who was a stillborn and a sister Leehna Maher-Sullivan. His father left Mary and their children at a very young age leaving all the responsibility to his mother. Mary Sullivan was a doting mother who supported her only son Tommy throughout his professional boxing career. In Joseph Barboza's autobiography "Barboza", Sullivan is wrongly identified as "Rocky", not "Tommy". Thomas was known in the neighborhood as a "tough puncher" who later went to work as a longshoreman in Boston, Massachusetts and lived with his mother on East Fifth Street. Even after his boxing career finished he remained physically fit from working dock at the Boston Harbor as a longshoreman and sparred at a gym to maintained his lean physique. During the late night bar brawl with Edward McLaughlin Tommy showed immense strength and lifted up one end of the four-door sedan and was able to move the car and prop one of the wheel chassis up on the curb, putting the sedan on a tilt and allowing him access to the bloodied and battered cowering Edward McLaughlin who had retreated for cover underneath and continue the assault. His opponent, Edward was severely handicapped against Sullivan at the time of the fight, he was out of shape and was out of shape from alcoholism.
When Thomas could not financially support himself after his successful boxing career ended he moved back into his childhood home to live with his elderly mother and cared for her. It is suggested that after he stopped his boxing career that he suffered from bouts of alcoholism brought on by depression.
He became well known around Boston during his boxing career including notorious Patriarca crime family members and associates like Joseph Barboza in North Boston, although he never was positively recognized as an associate of the Patriarca crime family who managed a stable of prize fighters during that time and maintained a clean boxing record. The unsubtantiated rumors that Thomas was a prizefighter first emerged on June 9, 1942 during the match with Dave Hoblitzel in Portland, Oregon. The bout was stopped by the referees. The boxing officials in attendance stated that neither man was trying. Although he was never put under scrutiny for corruption during his professional boxing career, investigative journalist Howie Carr refers to him as a "prizefighter". After his professional boxing career ended abruptly he sought out work as a longshoreman at the Boston Harbor. While working at the docks he no doubt struck up friendly relationships with McLaughlin Brothers associate Thomas J. Ballou and Patriarca crime family mob associate Joseph Barboza.
After the death of Thomas, Mary was overcome with emotional distress and shock and confined herself to her bed. Soon afterwards she was able to walk around their first floor apartment. On January 3, 1958, eleven days after both Harold Hannon and George McLaughlin were murdered by rival gangsters, Mary Sullivan died, she was eighty-three. A newspaper quoted neighbors as saying that her son's murder would "kill her." She was too grief-stricken and emotionally distraught to attend his funeral at Gates of Heaven Parish located at 615 East Fourth Street.
Boxing career.
At the age of twenty, Tom started his career as a professional boxer. He was considered by many a local celebrity in South Boston. On March 17, 1942 Tommy had his first professional boxing match against Johnny Lawless in Portland, Maine. During this match Lawless retired in his corner after the second round, due to a laceration over his eye that he received from Sullivan. On June 9, 1942 he fought Dave Hoblitzel in Portland, Maine. The bout with Hoblitzel was the boxing match that brought up allegations of corruption. Although Thomas was never put under scrutiny for corruption during his professional boxing career, investigative journalist Howie Carr referred to him as a "pug ugly prizefighter". On March 18, 1946 he fought against Jimmy Fields in Boston, Massachusetts. Fields fought the fight against Sullivan under the ring moniker "John Henry Eskew". Before a large crowd totaling 10,817, Eskew dropped Sullivan for a count of two in the second round. Following his loss, an angry Sullivan continued on and gave Eskew a brutal beating over the next two rounds. He left Fields draped over the ropes in the fourth round and won by a technical knockout. 
On October 14, 1946 he fought George Kochan at the Mechanics Building in Boston. During the fight he was knocked down twice before coming back to stop Kochan. This was considered "a savage slugging match." On December 14, 1946 Tommy was matched up against Al Priest in Boston. This was the largest gate ever attracted at an indoor boxing match in Boston up to that time. 13,250 spectators attended the sport, the ring accumulated $59,944 in total. On July 15, 1946 Tommy fought Anthony Jones. The referee stopped the fight with Jones reeling about the ring helplessly. Jones was winning at the end of the sixth round, but Sullivan dropped him a 9-count in round seven, and launched a "hurricane attack" in the eighth which caused the fight to be stopped. On June 2, 1947 he fought against Coley Welch. He successfully knocked down Welch twice in the third round and one in the seventh round. His last professional fight was on January 21, 1949 against Johnny Carter in Worcester, Massachusetts.
He fought with an orthodox stance and boxed 143 rounds over the span of his short career winning twenty of them with fourteen knock outs and two losses. Thomas was considered by many to be one of the more successful boxers that came out of Boston during that time period, more than Edward G. Connors, Anthony Veranis, Rocco DiSiglio and Americo Sacramone.
Barroom brawl with Edward McLaughlin.
Thomas had resentment and anger towards the McLaughlin gang, and the gang leader George McLaughlin who had attempted to extort one of his close friends for money in early December. This infuriated him to no end. Two weeks before he was murdered, he made the mistake of getting into a vicious bar room brawl with Edward McLaughlin. By mob associates it was considered a good battle because both McLaughlin and Sullivan were ex-professionals, but Sullivan had a more successful bout than McLaughlin and had been a main event celebrity fighter. The trouble arose from a heated argument that soon turned violent. Edward hit Sullivan from behind with a length of iron pipe, knocking him to the floor. Edward swung again but he rolled out of the way and got to his feet, his face badly bloodied from the blindsided attack. One of Sullivan's punches during the fight tore McLaughlin's ear. The bar brawl was witnessed by many South End Bostoners including Joseph Barboza, his fellow friend, sparring partner and longshoreman.
The fight played out in the barroom and then made its way out into the street. Edward, now badly beaten, finally gave up and rolled under a car parked in the street to get away. Tommy was relentless in his attack on the gangster, he lifted up one end of the car and propped one of the wheels up on the curb allowing him access to McLaughlin.
Gangland slaying.
After Edward McLaughlin was beaten, he held a great feeling of contempt and hatred for the former professional boxing celebrity. On December 24, 1957 Thomas was called to the side of a car that was idling in the street near his East Fifth Street home at 6:35 p.m. and was shot five times, killing him. It was originally believed that one of the gunman's shots mowed down Tommy in front of an old cemetery but Medical Examiner Dr. Richard Ford revealed that three shots had nearly torn off his head and two of the shots had lodged in his shoulder. During the initial murder investigation, homicide detectives became quickly convinced that his murder was connected with the Irish Mob wars between the McLaughlin Gang and the powerful Patriarca crime family. Two suspects, including Edward McLaughlin were brought in for questioning about the murder. One provided an airtight alibi clearing him of any suspicion in the murder while McLaughlin remained under suspicion. The case eventually went cold and no one was ever charged or convicted in the murder of Sullivan. Howie Carr states that Sullivan's killer was Harold Hannon. Hannon was later murdered in the ensuing Irish Mob wars.
Harold was garroted with piano wire and had his corpse tossed into the Boston Harbor on August 20, 1964.
Sullivan's bar brawling foe, mob leader Edward McLaughlin was shot dead at a bus stop in West Roxbury, Massachusetts in October 1965.

Ameer Faisal Alavi

Major General Ameer Faisal Alavi (28 March 1954 – 19 November 2008) was a Pakistan Army two-star general and special operations expert who was the first General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the elite Special Service Group of Pakistan Army. A former member of Special Service Group, he was credited with masterminding the Angoor Ada operation in 2004, where many Arabs and Chechens based in the tribal areas were killed or arrested and turned over to the Americans.
On 19 November 2008, while driving to work in his car in Islamabad, he was shot dead by three unknown gunmen. It was alleged that Ilyas Kashmiri, the chief of Jammu & Kashmir chapter of Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, was behind the murder of Maj-Gen Alavi at the behest of the Taliban in North Waziristan.
Early life.
Alavi was born and raised in Kenya during his childhood (which at that time was a British colony) as a British national. His parents had migrated to the country from Pakistan. He belonged to the Awan tribe of Pakistan. In 1966 at the age of 12, he came back to Pakistan to study at Abbottabad Public School where he studied from 1966 to 1971. Out of his love and zeal for the military he renounced his British nationality. He got his Pakistani citizenship when he wrote to then President of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to be granted citizenship in order to be able to join the Pakistan Army. He thus renounced his British nationality to join Pakistan Army. He was commissioned in the 49th PMA Long Course in 1974 in the 26th Cavalry Regiment of the Armoured Corps.
Family.
Maj Gen Alavi has two daughters who live in with their mother but at the time of his death they were both in USA. His sister Nadira Naipaul is a former journalist and married to noted British-Trinidadian novelist and Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul At the time of his death he was living with his wife in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi.
Commander SSG and forced retirement.
Alavi was promoted to major general in January 2003 and assigned as the first General Officer Commanding (GOC) of Special Service Group (SSG). This post was upgraded from brigadier to major-general level post. He was also the first Pakistan Army officer who captained the Armed Forces Skydiving Team (AFST) as a General Officer on 23 March 2005. While serving as the chief of Special Service Group, Major General Alavi spearheaded an operation against the Taliban in Pakistan’s North-West Frontier Province, the first-ever Army operation in North Waziristan in 2004.
In August 2005, however, he was sacked by General Pervez Musharraf from his post as head of Pakistan's Special Service Group (SSG), for "conduct unbecoming." Carey Schofield, writing for the British newspaper The Sunday Times, reported that there was a plot by Major General Alavi’s enemies using an affair with a divorced Pakistani woman to discredit him. While having a conversation with his colleagues he was challenged on the issue, Alavi made a remark considered disrespectful to General Pervez Musharraf, then the president. Some of his enemies played the recording of this conversation to General Musharraf and Alavi was sacked.
Post-retirement years.
After his retirement he worked as CEO and Executive Director of REDtone Telecommunication Pakistan Ltd, a privately held telecommunications company in Pakistan.
He, however, continued to make efforts to clear his name from the allegations made against him that lead to his sacking. He wanted his honour to be restored and to be given then Hilal-e-Imtiaz (Military) or the "Crescent of Excellence", a medal he would have been given had he not been dismissed.
Assassination.
On 19 November 2008, while driving to work in his car, he was shot dead by three unknown gunmen on Islamabad Highway near the PWD Colony in the Koral police precincts. This happened close to his home in Bahria Town.
Earlier on 21 July 2008, General Alavi had send a letter to the chief of Pakistan Army General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani requesting to restore his benefits and suggesting that two army General Officers had plotted to get him expelled from the Army because they wanted to hide their involvement in "a matter he was privy to". He had threatened to expose Pakistani army generals who he believed had made deals with Taliban militants and warned that he would "furnish all relevant proof."
In October 2008 risking his life, he gave a copy of this letter to Carey Schofield in Talkingfish Islamabad restaurant which was also his favorite. When he did not get a reply from General Kayani he was concerned for his life and mentioned that to Schofield in a conversation, "It hasn’t worked, They’ll shoot me."
Four days after his conversation with the British journalist while he was driving through Islamabad his car was halted by another vehicle and the gunmen opened fire from either side. He was shot eight times. His driver was also killed. The gunmen had used 9mm pistols, a standard army issue, and the killings were believe to be "far more clinical than a normal militant attack" giving rise to speculation of involvement of Pakistani Army personnel in the murder.
Revelations to Carey Schofield and British SAS.
In August 2005 while visiting Hereford, the home of the Special Air Service (SAS) he was keen to revive the SSG’s relationship with British special forces and expressed unhappiness about the way some elements of Pakistan’s army were behaving. He wanted kit, skills and training from the UK for the SSG. When he was bluntly asked by an SAS officer why the Pakistani army should be given all this help if nothing came of it in terms of getting the Al-Qaeda leadership, he replied "he knew that Pakistan was not pulling its weight in the war on terror."
He told Carey Schofield how one general had done a deal with Baitullah Mehsud, the 35-year-old Taliban leader. Mehsud, was the main suspect in the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007. He was also believed to have been behind a plot to bomb transport networks in several European countries including Britain, which came to light when 14 alleged conspirators were arrested in Barcelona. He revealed that a senior Pakistani general came to an arrangement with Mehsud "whereby – in return for a large sum of money – Mehsud’s 3,000 armed fighters would not attack the army."
Carey Schofield later reported that Alavi had suggested that two senior generals named in Alavi’s letter to Kayani were in effect complicit in giving the militants free rein in return for refraining from attacks on the Pakistani army.
Role of Ilyas Kashmiri.
The editorial in "Daily Times" claimed that Maj (Retd) Haroon Ashiq was the assassin of Maj-Gen Faisal Alavi "for Rs 150,000 given him by Kashmiri." This was consistent with Interior Minister Rehman Malik's statement on television in August 2009 that "officers of the rank of major" in the intelligence agencies with links with the Taliban and Al-Qaeda had been arrested "because they wanted to target army generals."
Ilyas Kashmiri was reportedly killed in a US drone attack in Waziristan on September 7, 2009 but survived and remains at large. He had reorganized 313 Brigade in North Waziristan (it was earlier active in Indian-held Kashmir before 9/11) that was responsible for carrying out multiple terrorist attacks throughout the country. It had 3000 fighters in its ranks including many former Pakistan Army officers. Earlier Kashmiri was arrested after the twin attacks on President General Pervez Musharraf in December 2003, but was later released in February 2004 at the insistence of United Jihad Council led by Sayeed Salahudeen.
Funeral.
He was buried at the army graveyard in Rawalpindi a few days after his assassination. Soldiers had come from across Pakistan to bury the general with military honours. Wreaths were laid on behalf of Kayani and most of the country’s military leadership.
After his death he was described by his daughter to a Pakistani newspaper as an "easy going, humble, compassionate, but very fearless" person.
