Matrix (mathematics)

In mathematics, a matrix (plural matrices) is a rectangular "array" of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in "rows" and "columns". The individual items in a matrix are called its "elements" or "entries". An example of a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns is
Matrices of the same size can be added or subtracted element by element. But the rule for matrix multiplication is that two matrices can be multiplied only when the number of columns in the first equals the number of rows in the second. A major application of matrices is to represent linear transformations, that is, generalizations of linear functions such as . For example, the rotation of vectors in three dimensional space is a linear transformation. If R is a rotation matrix and v is a column vector (a matrix with only one column) describing the position of a point in space, the product Rv is a column vector describing the position of that point after a rotation. The product of two matrices is a matrix that represents the composition of two linear transformations. Another application of matrices is in the solution of a system of linear equations. If the matrix is square, it is possible to deduce some of its properties by computing its determinant. For example, a square matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant is not zero. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors provide insight into the geometry of linear transformations.
Applications of matrices are found in most scientific fields. In every branch of physics, including classical mechanics, optics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and quantum electrodynamics, they are used to study physical phenomena, such as the motion of rigid bodies. In computer graphics, they are used to project a 3-dimensional image onto a 2-dimensional screen. In probability theory and statistics, stochastic matrices are used to describe sets of probabilities; for instance, they are used within the PageRank algorithm that ranks the pages in a Google search. Matrix calculus generalizes classical analytical notions such as derivatives and exponentials to higher dimensions.
A major branch of numerical analysis is devoted to the development of efficient algorithms for matrix computations, a subject that is centuries old and is today an expanding area of research. Matrix decomposition methods simplify computations, both theoretically and practically. Algorithms that are tailored to particular matrix structures, such as sparse matrices and near-diagonal matrices, expedite computations in finite element method and other computations. Infinite matrices occur in planetary theory and in atomic theory. A simple example of an infinite matrix is the matrix representing the derivative operator, which acts on the Taylor series of a function.
Definition.
A "matrix" is a rectangular array of numbers or other mathematical objects, for which operations such as addition and multiplication are defined. Most commonly, a matrix over a field "F" is a rectangular array of scalars from "F". Most of this article focuses on "real" and "complex matrices", i.e., matrices whose elements are real numbers or complex numbers, respectively. More general types of entries are discussed below. For instance, this is a real matrix:
The numbers, symbols or expressions in the matrix are called its "entries" or its "elements". The horizontal and vertical lines of entries in a matrix are called "rows" and "columns", respectively.
Size.
The size of a matrix is defined by the number of rows and columns that it contains. A matrix with "m" rows and "n" columns is called an "m"¬†√ó¬†"n" matrix or "m"-by-"n" matrix, while "m" and "n" are called its "dimensions". For example, the matrix A above is a 3¬†√ó¬†2 matrix.
Matrices which have a single row are called "row vectors", and those which have a single column are called "column vectors". A matrix which has the same number of rows and columns is called a "square matrix". A matrix with an infinite number of rows or columns (or both) is called an "infinite matrix". In some contexts such as computer algebra programs it is useful to consider a matrix with no rows or no columns, called an "empty matrix".
Notation.
Matrices are commonly written in box brackets:
An alternative notation uses large parentheses instead of box brackets:
The specifics of symbolic matrix notation varies widely, with some prevailing trends. Matrices are usually symbolized using upper-case letters (such as A in the examples above), while the corresponding lower-case letters, with two subscript indices (e.g., "a"11, or "a"1,1), represent the entries. In addition to using upper-case letters to symbolize matrices, many authors use a special typographical style, commonly boldface upright (non-italic), to further distinguish matrices from other mathematical objects. An alternative notation involves the use of a double-underline with the variable name, with or without boldface style, (e.g., formula_5).
The entry in the "i"-th row and "j"-th column of a matrix A is sometimes referred to as the "i","j", ("i","j"), or ("i","j")th entry of the matrix, and most commonly denoted as "a""i","j", or "a""ij". Alternative notations for that entry are "A"["i,j"] or "A""i,j". For example, the (1,3) entry of the following matrix A is 5 (also denoted "a"13, "a"1,3, "A"["1,3"] or "A""1,3"):
Sometimes, the entries of a matrix can be defined by a formula such as "a""i","j" = "f"("i", "j"). For example, each of the entries of the following matrix A is determined by "a""ij" = "i" ‚àí "j". 
In this case, the matrix itself is sometimes defined by that formula, within square brackets or double parenthesis. For example, the matrix above is defined as A = ["i"-"j"], or A = (("i"-"j")). If matrix size is "m" √ó "n", the above-mentioned formula "f"("i", "j") is valid for any "i" = 1, ..., "m" and any "j" = 1, ..., "n". This can be either specified separately, or using "m" √ó "n" as a subscript. For instance, the matrix A above is 3 √ó 4 and can be defined as A = ["i" ‚àí "j"] ("i" = 1, 2, 3; "j" = 1, ..., 4), or A = ["i" ‚àí "j"]"3"√ó"4".
Some programming languages utilize doubly subscripted arrays (or arrays of arrays) to represent an "m"-√ó-"n" matrix. Some programming languages start the numbering of array indexes at zero, in which case the entries of an "m"-by-"n" matrix are indexed by and . This article follows the more common convention in mathematical writing where enumeration starts from 1.
The set of all "m"-by-"n" matrices is denoted ùïÑ("m", "n").
Basic operations.
There are a number of basic operations that can be applied to modify matrices, called "matrix addition", "scalar multiplication", "transposition", "matrix multiplication", "row operations", and "submatrix".
Addition, scalar multiplication and transposition.
Familiar properties of numbers extend to these operations of matrices: for example, addition is commutative, i.e., the matrix sum does not depend on the order of the summands: A¬†+¬†B¬†=¬†B¬†+¬†A.
The transpose is compatible with addition and scalar multiplication, as expressed by ("c"A)T = "c"(AT) and (A¬†+¬†B)T¬†=¬†AT¬†+¬†BT. Finally, (AT)T¬†=¬†A.
Matrix multiplication.
"Multiplication" of two matrices is defined only if the number of columns of the left matrix is the same as the number of rows of the right matrix. If A is an "m"-by-"n" matrix and B is an "n"-by-"p" matrix, then their "matrix product" AB is the "m"-by-"p" matrix whose entries are given by dot product of the corresponding row of A and the corresponding column of B:
where 1 ‚â§ "i" ‚â§ "m" and 1 ‚â§ "j" ‚â§ "p". For example, the underlined entry 2340 in the product is calculated as 
Matrix multiplication satisfies the rules (AB)C = A(BC) (associativity), and (A+B)C = AC+BC as well as C(A+B) = CA+CB (left and right distributivity), whenever the size of the matrices is such that the various products are defined. The product AB may be defined without BA being defined, namely if A and B are "m"-by-"n" and "n"-by-"k" matrices, respectively, and Even if both products are defined, they need not be equal, i.e., generally one has
i.e., matrix multiplication is not commutative, in marked contrast to (rational, real, or complex) numbers whose product is independent of the order of the factors. An example of two matrices not commuting with each other is:
whereas
Besides the ordinary matrix multiplication just described, there exist other less frequently used operations on matrices that can be considered forms of multiplication, such as the Hadamard product and the Kronecker product. They arise in solving matrix equations such as the Sylvester equation.
Row operations.
There are three types of row operations:
These operations are used in a number of ways, including solving linear equations and finding matrix inverses.
Submatrix.
A submatrix of a matrix is obtained by deleting any collection of rows and/or columns. For example, for the following 3-by-4 matrix, we can construct a 2-by-3 submatrix by removing row 3 and column 2:
The minors and cofactors of a matrix are found by computing the determinant of certain submatrices.
Linear equations.
Matrices can be used to compactly write and work with multiple linear equations, i.e., systems of linear equations. For example, if A is an "m"-by-"n" matrix, x designates a column vector (i.e., "n"√ó1-matrix) of "n" variables "x"1, "x"2, ..., "x""n", and b is an "m"√ó1-column vector, then the matrix equation
is equivalent to the system of linear equations
Linear transformations.
Matrices and matrix multiplication reveal their essential features when related to "linear transformations", also known as "linear maps". A real "m"-by-"n" matrix A gives rise to a linear transformation R"n" ‚Üí R"m" mapping each vector x in R"n" to the (matrix) product Ax, which is a vector in R"m". Conversely, each linear transformation "f": R"n" ‚Üí R"m" arises from a unique "m"-by-"n" matrix A: explicitly, the of A is the "i"th coordinate of "f"(e"j"), where e"j" = (0...,0,1,0...,0) is the unit vector with 1 in the "j"th position and 0 elsewhere. The matrix A is said to represent the linear map "f", and A is called the "transformation matrix" of "f".
For example, the 2√ó2 matrix
can be viewed as the transform of the unit square into a parallelogram with vertices at , , , and . The parallelogram pictured at the right is obtained by multiplying A with each of the column vectors formula_14 and formula_15 in turn. These vectors define the vertices of the unit square.
The following table shows a number of 2-by-2 matrices with the associated linear maps of R2. The blue original is mapped to the green grid and shapes. The origin (0,0) is marked with a black point.
Under the 1-to-1 correspondence between matrices and linear maps, matrix multiplication corresponds to composition of maps: if a "k"-by-"m" matrix B represents another linear map "g" : R"m" ‚Üí R"k", then the composition is represented by BA since
The last equality follows from the above-mentioned associativity of matrix multiplication.
The rank of a matrix A is the maximum number of linearly independent row vectors of the matrix, which is the same as the maximum number of linearly independent column vectors. Equivalently it is the dimension of the image of the linear map represented by A. The rank-nullity theorem states that the dimension of the kernel of a matrix plus the rank equals the number of columns of the matrix.
Square matrices.
A square matrix is a matrix with the same number of rows and columns. An "n"-by-"n" matrix is known as a square matrix of order "n." Any two square matrices of the same order can be added and multiplied. 
The entries "a""ii" form the main diagonal of a square matrix. They lie on the imaginary line which runs from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the matrix.
Main types.
Diagonal and triangular matrices.
If all entries of A below the main diagonal are zero, A is called an "upper triangular matrix". Similarly if all entries of "A" above the main diagonal are zero, A is called a "lower triangular matrix". If all entries outside the main diagonal are zero, A is called a diagonal matrix.
Identity matrix.
The identity matrix I"n" of size "n" is the "n"-by-"n" matrix in which all the elements on the main diagonal are equal to 1 and all other elements are equal to 0, e.g.
It is a square matrix of order "n", and also a special kind of diagonal matrix. It is called identity matrix because multiplication with it leaves a matrix unchanged: 
Symmetric or skew-symmetric matrix.
A square matrix A that is equal to its transpose, i.e., A = AT, is a symmetric matrix. If instead, A was equal to the negative of its transpose, i.e., A = ‚àíAT, then A is a skew-symmetric matrix. In complex matrices, symmetry is often replaced by the concept of Hermitian matrices, which satisfy A‚àó = A, where the star or asterisk denotes the conjugate transpose of the matrix, i.e., the transpose of the complex conjugate of A.
By the spectral theorem, real symmetric matrices and complex Hermitian matrices have an eigenbasis; i.e., every vector is expressible as a linear combination of eigenvectors. In both cases, all eigenvalues are real. This theorem can be generalized to infinite-dimensional situations related to matrices with infinitely many rows and columns, see below.
Invertible matrix and its inverse.
A square matrix A is called "invertible" or "non-singular" if there exists a matrix B such that
If B exists, it is unique and is called the "inverse matrix" of A, denoted A‚àí1.
Definite matrix.
A symmetric "n"√ó"n"-matrix is called" positive-definite" (respectively negative-definite; indefinite), if for all nonzero vectors x¬†‚àà¬†R"n" the associated quadratic form given by
takes only positive values (respectively only negative values; both some negative and some positive values). If the quadratic form takes only non-negative (respectively only non-positive) values, the symmetric matrix is called positive-semidefinite (respectively negative-semidefinite); hence the matrix is indefinite precisely when it is neither positive-semidefinite nor negative-semidefinite.
A symmetric matrix is positive-definite if and only if all its eigenvalues are positive. The table at the right shows two possibilities for 2-by-2 matrices.
Allowing as input two different vectors instead yields the bilinear form associated to A:
Orthogonal matrix.
An "orthogonal matrix" is a square matrix with real entries whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors (i.e., orthonormal vectors). Equivalently, a matrix "A" is orthogonal if its transpose is equal to its inverse:
which entails
where "I" is the identity matrix.
An orthogonal matrix "A" is necessarily invertible (with inverse ), unitary (), and normal (). The determinant of any orthogonal matrix is either +1 or ‚àí1. A "special orthogonal matrix" is an orthogonal matrix with determinant +1. As a linear transformation, every orthogonal matrix with determinant +1 is a pure rotation, while every orthogonal matrix with determinant -1 is either a pure reflection, or a composition of reflection and rotation.
The complex analogue of an orthogonal matrix is a unitary matrix.
Main operations.
Trace.
The trace, tr(A) of a square matrix A is the sum of its diagonal entries. While matrix multiplication is not commutative as mentioned above, the trace of the product of two matrices is independent of the order of the factors: 
This is immediate from the definition of matrix multiplication:
Also, the trace of a matrix is equal to that of its transpose, i.e.,
Determinant.
The "determinant" det(A) or |A| of a square matrix A is a number encoding certain properties of the matrix. A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is nonzero. Its absolute value equals the area (in R2) or volume (in R3) of the image of the unit square (or cube), while its sign corresponds to the orientation of the corresponding linear map: the determinant is positive if and only if the orientation is preserved.
The determinant of 2-by-2 matrices is given by
The determinant of 3-by-3 matrices involves 6 terms (rule of Sarrus). The more lengthy Leibniz formula generalises these two formulae to all dimensions.
The determinant of a product of square matrices equals the product of their determinants: 
Adding a multiple of any row to another row, or a multiple of any column to another column, does not change the determinant. Interchanging two rows or two columns affects the determinant by multiplying it by ‚àí1. Using these operations, any matrix can be transformed to a lower (or upper) triangular matrix, and for such matrices the determinant equals the product of the entries on the main diagonal; this provides a method to calculate the determinant of any matrix. Finally, the Laplace expansion expresses the determinant in terms of minors, i.e., determinants of smaller matrices. This expansion can be used for a recursive definition of determinants (taking as starting case the determinant of a 1-by-1 matrix, which is its unique entry, or even the determinant of a 0-by-0 matrix, which is 1), that can be seen to be equivalent to the Leibniz formula. Determinants can be used to solve linear systems using Cramer's rule, where the division of the determinants of two related square matrices equates to the value of each of the system's variables.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
A number Œª and a non-zero vector v satisfying
are called an "eigenvalue" and an "eigenvector" of A, respectively. The number Œª is an eigenvalue of an "n"√ó"n"-matrix A if and only if A‚àíŒªI"n" is not invertible, which is equivalent to
The polynomial "p"A in an indeterminate "X" given by evaluation the determinant det("X"I"n"‚àíA) is called the characteristic polynomial of A. It is a monic polynomial of degree "n". Therefore the polynomial equation "p"A(Œª)¬†=¬†0 has at most "n" different solutions, i.e., eigenvalues of the matrix. They may be complex even if the entries of A are real. According to the Cayley‚ÄìHamilton theorem, "p"A(A) = 0, that is, the result of substituting the matrix itself into its own characteristic polynomial yields the zero matrix.
Computational aspects.
Matrix calculations can be often performed with different techniques. Many problems can be solved by both direct algorithms or iterative approaches. For example, the eigenvectors of a square matrix can be obtained by finding a sequence of vectors x"n" converging to an eigenvector when "n" tends to infinity.
To be able to choose the more appropriate algorithm for each specific problem, it is important to determine both the effectiveness and precision of all the available algorithms. The domain studying these matters is called numerical linear algebra. As with other numerical situations, two main aspects are the complexity of algorithms and their numerical stability.
Determining the complexity of an algorithm means finding upper bounds or estimates of how many elementary operations such as additions and multiplications of scalars are necessary to perform some algorithm, e.g., multiplication of matrices. For example, calculating the matrix product of two "n"-by-"n" matrix using the definition given above needs "n"3 multiplications, since for any of the "n"2 entries of the product, "n" multiplications are necessary. The Strassen algorithm outperforms this "naive" algorithm; it needs only "n"2.807 multiplications. A refined approach also incorporates specific features of the computing devices.
In many practical situations additional information about the matrices involved is known. An important case are sparse matrices, i.e., matrices most of whose entries are zero. There are specifically adapted algorithms for, say, solving linear systems Ax = b for sparse matrices A, such as the conjugate gradient method.
An algorithm is, roughly speaking, numerically stable, if little deviations in the input values do not lead to big deviations in the result. For example, calculating the inverse of a matrix via Laplace's formula (Adj (A) denotes the adjugate matrix of A)
may lead to significant rounding errors if the determinant of the matrix is very small. The norm of a matrix can be used to capture the conditioning of linear algebraic problems, such as computing a matrix' inverse.
Although most computer languages are not designed with commands or libraries for matrices, as early as the 1970s, some engineering desktop computers such as the HP 9830 had ROM cartridges to add BASIC commands for matrices. Some computer languages such as APL were designed to manipulate matrices, and various mathematical programs can be used to aid computing with matrices.
Decomposition.
There are several methods to render matrices into a more easily accessible form. They are generally referred to as "matrix decomposition" or "matrix factorization" techniques. The interest of all these techniques is that they preserve certain properties of the matrices in question, such as determinant, rank or inverse, so that these quantities can be calculated after applying the transformation, or that certain matrix operations are algorithmically easier to carry out for some types of matrices.
The LU decomposition factors matrices as a product of lower (L) and an upper triangular matrices (U). Once this decomposition is calculated, linear systems can be solved more efficiently, by a simple technique called forward and back substitution. Likewise, inverses of triangular matrices are algorithmically easier to calculate. The "Gaussian elimination" is a similar algorithm; it transforms any matrix to row echelon form. Both methods proceed by multiplying the matrix by suitable elementary matrices, which correspond to permuting rows or columns and adding multiples of one row to another row. Singular value decomposition expresses any matrix A as a product UDV‚àó, where U and V are unitary matrices and D is a diagonal matrix.
The eigendecomposition or "diagonalization" expresses A as a product VDV‚àí1, where D is a diagonal matrix and V is a suitable invertible matrix. If A can be written in this form, it is called diagonalizable. More generally, and applicable to all matrices, the Jordan decomposition transforms a matrix into Jordan normal form, that is to say matrices whose only nonzero entries are the eigenvalues Œª1 to Œªn of A, placed on the main diagonal and possibly entries equal to one directly above the main diagonal, as shown at the right. Given the eigendecomposition, the "n"th power of A (i.e., "n"-fold iterated matrix multiplication) can be calculated via
and the power of a diagonal matrix can be calculated by taking the corresponding powers of the diagonal entries, which is much easier than doing the exponentiation for A instead. This can be used to compute the matrix exponential "e"A, a need frequently arising in solving linear differential equations, matrix logarithms and square roots of matrices. To avoid numerically ill-conditioned situations, further algorithms such as the Schur decomposition can be employed.
Abstract algebraic aspects and generalizations.
Matrices can be generalized in different ways. Abstract algebra uses matrices with entries in more general fields or even rings, while linear algebra codifies properties of matrices in the notion of linear maps. It is possible to consider matrices with infinitely many columns and rows. Another extension are tensors, which can be seen as higher-dimensional arrays of numbers, as opposed to vectors, which can often be realised as sequences of numbers, while matrices are rectangular or two-dimensional array of numbers. Matrices, subject to certain requirements tend to form groups known as matrix groups.
Matrices with more general entries.
This article focuses on matrices whose entries are real or complex numbers. However, matrices can be considered with much more general types of entries than real or complex numbers. As a first step of generalization, any field, i.e., a set where addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations are defined and well-behaved, may be used instead of R or C, for example rational numbers or finite fields. For example, coding theory makes use of matrices over finite fields. Wherever eigenvalues are considered, as these are roots of a polynomial they may exist only in a larger field than that of the coefficients of the matrix; for instance they may be complex in case of a matrix with real entries. The possibility to reinterpret the entries of a matrix as elements of a larger field (e.g., to view a real matrix as a complex matrix whose entries happen to be all real) then allows considering each square matrix to possess a full set of eigenvalues. Alternatively one can consider only matrices with entries in an algebraically closed field, such as C, from the outset.
More generally, abstract algebra makes great use of matrices with entries in a ring "R". Rings are a more general notion than fields in that a division operation need not exist. The very same addition and multiplication operations of matrices extend to this setting, too. The set M("n", "R") of all square "n"-by-"n" matrices over "R" is a ring called matrix ring, isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of the left "R"-module "R""n". If the ring "R" is commutative, i.e., its multiplication is commutative, then M("n", "R") is a unitary noncommutative (unless "n" = 1) associative algebra over "R". The determinant of square matrices over a commutative ring "R" can still be defined using the Leibniz formula; such a matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is invertible in "R", generalising the situation over a field "F", where every nonzero element is invertible. Matrices over superrings are called supermatrices.
Matrices do not always have all their entries in the same ring¬†‚Äì or even in any ring at all. One special but common case is block matrices, which may be considered as matrices whose entries themselves are matrices. The entries need not be quadratic matrices, and thus need not be members of any ordinary ring; but their sizes must fulfil certain compatibility conditions.
Relationship to linear maps.
Linear maps R"n" ‚Üí R"m" are equivalent to "m"-by-"n" matrices, as described above. More generally, any linear map between finite-dimensional vector spaces can be described by a matrix A = ("a""ij"), after choosing bases v1, ..., v"n" of "V", and w1, ..., w"m" of "W" (so "n" is the dimension of "V" and "m" is the dimension of "W"), which is such that
In other words, column "j" of "A" expresses the image of v"j" in terms of the basis vectors w"i" of "W"; thus this relation uniquely determines the entries of the matrix A. Note that the matrix depends on the choice of the bases: different choices of bases give rise to different, but equivalent matrices. Many of the above concrete notions can be reinterpreted in this light, for example, the transpose matrix A"T" describes the transpose of the linear map given by A, with respect to the dual bases.
These properties can be restated in a more natural way: the category of all matrices with entries in a field formula_23 with multiplication as composition is equivalent to the category of finite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps over this field.
More generally, the set of "m"√ó"n" matrices can be used to represent the "R"-linear maps between the free modules "R""m" and "R""n" for an arbitrary ring "R" with unity. When "n"¬†=¬†"m" composition of these maps is possible, and this gives rise to the matrix ring of "n"√ó"n" matrices representing the endomorphism ring of "R""n".
Matrix groups.
A group is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of objects together with a binary operation, i.e., an operation combining any two objects to a third, subject to certain requirements. A group in which the objects are matrices and the group operation is matrix multiplication is called a "matrix group". Since in a group every element has to be invertible, the most general matrix groups are the groups of all invertible matrices of a given size, called the general linear groups.
Any property of matrices that is preserved under matrix products and inverses can be used to define further matrix groups. For example, matrices with a given size and with a determinant of 1 form a subgroup of (i.e., a smaller group contained in) their general linear group, called a special linear group. Orthogonal matrices, determined by the condition
form the orthogonal group. Every orthogonal matrix has determinant 1 or ‚àí1. Orthogonal matrices with determinant 1 form a subgroup called "special orthogonal group".
Every finite group is isomorphic to a matrix group, as one can see by considering the regular representation of the symmetric group. General groups can be studied using matrix groups, which are comparatively well-understood, by means of representation theory.
Infinite matrices.
It is also possible to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns even if, being infinite objects, one cannot write down such matrices explicitly. All that matters is that for every element in the set indexing rows, and every element in the set indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.
If "R" is any ring with unity, then the ring of endomorphisms of formula_24 as a right "R" module is isomorphic to the ring of column finite matrices formula_25 whose entries are indexed by formula_26, and whose columns each contain only finitely many nonzero entries. The endomorphisms of "M" considered as a left "R" module result in an analogous object, the row finite matrices formula_27 whose rows each only have finitely many nonzero entries.
If infinite matrices are used to describe linear maps, then only those matrices can be used all of whose columns have but a finite number of nonzero entries, for the following reason. For a matrix A to describe a linear map "f": "V"‚Üí"W", bases for both spaces must have been chosen; recall that by definition this means that every vector in the space can be written uniquely as a (finite) linear combination of basis vectors, so that written as a (column) vector¬†"v" of coefficients, only finitely many entries "v""i" are nonzero. Now the columns of A describe the images by "f" of individual basis vectors of "V" in the basis of "W", which is only meaningful if these columns have only finitely many nonzero entries. There is no restriction on the rows of "A" however: in the product A¬∑"v" there are only finitely many nonzero coefficients of "v" involved, so every one of its entries, even if it is given as an infinite sum of products, involves only finitely many nonzero terms and is therefore well defined. Moreover this amounts to forming a linear combination of the columns of A that effectively involves only finitely many of them, whence the result has only finitely many nonzero entries, because each of those columns do. One also sees that products of two matrices of the given type is well defined (provided as usual that the column-index and row-index sets match), is again of the same type, and corresponds to the composition of linear maps.
If "R" is a normed ring, then the condition of row or column finiteness can be relaxed. With the norm in place, absolutely convergent series can be used instead of finite sums. For example, the matrices whose column sums are absolutely convergent sequences form a ring. Analogously of course, the matrices whose row sums are absolutely convergent series also form a ring.
In that vein, infinite matrices can also be used to describe operators on Hilbert spaces, where convergence and continuity questions arise, which again results in certain constraints that have to be imposed. However, the explicit point of view of matrices tends to obfuscate the matter, and the abstract and more powerful tools of functional analysis can be used instead.
Empty matrices.
An "empty matrix" is a matrix in which the number of rows or columns (or both) is zero. Empty matrices help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space. For example, if "A" is a 3-by-0 matrix and "B" is a 0-by-3 matrix, then "AB" is the 3-by-3 zero matrix corresponding to the null map from a 3-dimensional space "V" to itself, while "BA" is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for empty matrices, but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them. The determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 as follows from regarding the empty product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1. This value is also consistent with the fact that the identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant¬†1, a fact that is often used as a part of the characterization of determinants.
Applications.
There are numerous applications of matrices, both in mathematics and other sciences. Some of them merely take advantage of the compact representation of a set of numbers in a matrix. For example, in game theory and economics, the payoff matrix encodes the payoff for two players, depending on which out of a given (finite) set of alternatives the players choose. Text mining and automated thesaurus compilation makes use of document-term matrices such as tf-idf to track frequencies of certain words in several documents.
Complex numbers can be represented by particular real 2-by-2 matrices via
under which addition and multiplication of complex numbers and matrices correspond to each other. For example, 2-by-2 rotation matrices represent the multiplication with some complex number of absolute value 1, as above. A similar interpretation is possible for quaternions, and also for Clifford algebras in general.
Early encryption techniques such as the Hill cipher also used matrices. However, due to the linear nature of matrices, these codes are comparatively easy to break. Computer graphics uses matrices both to represent objects and to calculate transformations of objects using affine rotation matrices to accomplish tasks such as projecting a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional screen, corresponding to a theoretical camera observation. Matrices over a polynomial ring are important in the study of control theory.
Chemistry makes use of matrices in various ways, particularly since the use of quantum theory to discuss molecular bonding and spectroscopy. Examples are the overlap matrix and the Fock matrix used in solving the Roothaan equations to obtain the molecular orbitals of the Hartree‚ÄìFock method.
Graph theory.
The adjacency matrix of a finite graph is a basic notion of graph theory. It saves which vertices of the graph are connected by an edge. Matrices containing just two different values (1 and 0 meaning for example "yes" and "no", respectively) are called logical matrices. The distance (or cost) matrix contains information about distances of the edges. These concepts can be applied to websites connected hyperlinks or cities connected by roads etc., in which case (unless the road network is extremely dense) the matrices tend to be sparse, i.e., contain few nonzero entries. Therefore, specifically tailored matrix algorithms can be used in network theory.
Analysis and geometry.
The Hessian matrix of a differentiable function "∆í": R"n" ‚Üí R consists of the second derivatives of "∆í" with respect to the several coordinate directions, i.e.
[[File:Saddle Point SVG.svg|left|thumb|At the saddle point ("x"¬†=¬†0, "y"¬†=¬†0) (red) of the function "f"("x",‚àí"y") =¬†"x"2¬†‚àí¬†"y"2, the Hessian matrix formula_30 is indefinite.]]It encodes information about the local growth behaviour of the function: given a critical point x¬†=¬†("x"1,¬†...,¬†"x""n"), i.e., a point where the first partial derivatives formula_31 of "∆í" vanish, the function has a local minimum if the Hessian matrix is positive definite. Quadratic programming can be used to find global minima or maxima of quadratic functions closely related to the ones attached to matrices (see above).
Another matrix frequently used in geometrical situations is the Jacobi matrix of a differentiable map "f": R"n" ‚Üí R"m". If "f"1, ..., "f""m" denote the components of "f", then the Jacobi matrix is defined as 
If "n" > "m", and if the rank of the Jacobi matrix attains its maximal value "m", "f" is locally invertible at that point, by the implicit function theorem.
Partial differential equations can be classified by considering the matrix of coefficients of the highest-order differential operators of the equation. For elliptic partial differential equations this matrix is positive definite, which has decisive influence on the set of possible solutions of the equation in question.
The finite element method is an important numerical method to solve partial differential equations, widely applied in simulating complex physical systems. It attempts to approximate the solution to some equation by piecewise linear functions, where the pieces are chosen with respect to a sufficiently fine grid, which in turn can be recast as a matrix equation.
Probability theory and statistics.
Stochastic matrices are square matrices whose rows are probability vectors, i.e., whose entries are non-negative and sum up to one. Stochastic matrices are used to define Markov chains with finitely many states. A row of the stochastic matrix gives the probability distribution for the next position of some particle currently in the state that corresponds to the row. Properties of the Markov chain like absorbing states, i.e., states that any particle attains eventually, can be read off the eigenvectors of the transition matrices.
Statistics also makes use of matrices in many different forms. Descriptive statistics is concerned with describing data sets, which can often be represented as data matrices, which may then be subjected to dimensionality reduction techniques. The covariance matrix encodes the mutual variance of several random variables. Another technique using matrices are linear least squares, a method that approximates a finite set of pairs ("x"1, "y"1), ("x"2, "y"2), ..., ("x""N", "y""N"), by a linear function
which can be formulated in terms of matrices, related to the singular value decomposition of matrices.
Random matrices are matrices whose entries are random numbers, subject to suitable probability distributions, such as matrix normal distribution. Beyond probability theory, they are applied in domains ranging from number theory to physics.
Symmetries and transformations in physics.
Linear transformations and the associated symmetries play a key role in modern physics. For example, elementary particles in quantum field theory are classified as representations of the Lorentz group of special relativity and, more specifically, by their behavior under the spin group. Concrete representations involving the Pauli matrices and more general gamma matrices are an integral part of the physical description of fermions, which behave as spinors. For the three lightest quarks, there is a group-theoretical representation involving the special unitary group SU(3); for their calculations, physicists use a convenient matrix representation known as the Gell-Mann matrices, which are also used for the SU(3) gauge group that forms the basis of the modern description of strong nuclear interactions, quantum chromodynamics. The Cabibbo‚ÄìKobayashi‚ÄìMaskawa matrix, in turn, expresses the fact that the basic quark states that are important for weak interactions are not the same as, but linearly related to the basic quark states that define particles with specific and distinct masses.
Linear combinations of quantum states.
The first model of quantum mechanics (Heisenberg, 1925) represented the theory's operators by infinite-dimensional matrices acting on quantum states. This is also referred to as matrix mechanics. One particular example is the density matrix that characterizes the "mixed" state of a quantum system as a linear combination of elementary, "pure" eigenstates.
Another matrix serves as a key tool for describing the scattering experiments that form the cornerstone of experimental particle physics: Collision reactions such as occur in particle accelerators, where non-interacting particles head towards each other and collide in a small interaction zone, with a new set of non-interacting particles as the result, can be described as the scalar product of outgoing particle states and a linear combination of ingoing particle states. The linear combination is given by a matrix known as the S-matrix, which encodes all information about the possible interactions between particles.
Normal modes.
A general application of matrices in physics is to the description of linearly coupled harmonic systems. The equations of motion of such systems can be described in matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial when it comes to the internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.
Geometrical optics.
Geometrical optics provides further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, the wave nature of light is neglected. The result is a model in which light rays are indeed geometrical rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, the action of a lens or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes the properties of the optical element. Actually, there are two kinds of matrices, viz. a "refraction matrix" describing the refraction at a lens surface, and a "translation matrix", describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, where another refraction matrix applies.
The optical system, consisting of a combination of lenses and/or reflective elements, is simply described by the matrix resulting from the product of the components' matrices.
Electronics.
Traditional mesh analysis in electronics leads to a system of linear equations that can be described with a matrix.
The behaviour of many electronic components can be described using matrices. Let "A" be a 2-dimensional vector with the component's input voltage "v"1 and input current "i"1 as its elements, and let "B" be a 2-dimensional vector with the component's output voltage "v"2 and output current "i"2 as its elements. Then the behaviour of the electronic component can be described by "B" = "H" ¬∑ "A", where "H" is a 2 x 2 matrix containing one impedance element ("h"12), one admittance element ("h"21) and two dimensionless elements ("h"11 and "h"22). Calculating a circuit now reduces to multiplying matrices.
History.
Matrices have a long history of application in solving linear equations but they were known as arrays until the 1800s. The Chinese text "The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art" is the first example of the use of array methods to solve simultaneous equations, including the concept of determinants. In 1545 Italian mathematician Girolamo Cardano brought the method to Europe when he published "Ars Magna". The Japanese mathematician Seki used the same array methods to solve simultaneous equations in 1683. The Dutch Mathematician" "Jan de Witt represented transformations using arrays in his 1659 book "Elements of Curves" (1659). Between 1700 and 1710 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz publicized the use of arrays for recording information or solutions and experimented with over 50 different systems of arrays. Cramer presented his rule in 1750.
The term "matrix" (Latin for "womb", derived from "mater"‚Äîmother) was coined by James Joseph Sylvester in 1850, who understood a matrix as an object giving rise to a number of determinants today called minors, that is to say, determinants of smaller matrices that derive from the original one by removing columns and rows. In an 1851 paper, Sylvester explains:
Arthur Cayley published a treatise on geometric transformations using matrices that were not rotated versions of the coefficients being investigated as had previously been done. Instead he defined operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division as transformations of those matrices and showed the associative and distributive properties held true. Cayley investigated and demonstrated the non-commutative property of matrix multiplication as well as the commutative property of matrix addition. Early matrix theory had limited the use of arrays almost exclusively to determinants and Arthur Caley's abstract matrix operations were revolutionary. He was instrumental in proposing a matrix concept independent of equation systems. In 1858 Cayley published his "Memoir on the theory of matrices" in which he proposed and demonstrated the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.
An English mathematician named Cullis was the first to use modern bracket notation for matrices in 1913 and he simultaneously demonstrated the first significant use the notation A = ["a""i","j"] to represent a matrix where "a""i","j" refers to the" i"th row and the "j"th column.
The study of determinants sprang from several sources. Number-theoretical problems led Gauss to relate coefficients of quadratic forms, i.e., expressions such as and linear maps in three dimensions to matrices. Eisenstein further developed these notions, including the remark that, in modern parlance, matrix products are non-commutative. Cauchy was the first to prove general statements about determinants, using as definition of the determinant of a matrix A = ["a""i","j"] the following: replace the powers "a""j""k" by "a""jk" in the polynomial
where Œ† denotes the product of the indicated terms. He also showed, in 1829, that the eigenvalues of symmetric matrices are real. Jacobi studied "functional determinants"‚Äîlater called Jacobi determinants by Sylvester‚Äîwhich can be used to describe geometric transformations at a local (or infinitesimal) level, see above; Kronecker's "Vorlesungen √ºber die Theorie der Determinanten" and Weierstrass' "Zur Determinantentheorie", both published in 1903, first treated determinants axiomatically, as opposed to previous more concrete approaches such as the mentioned formula of Cauchy. At that point, determinants were firmly established.
Many theorems were first established for small matrices only, for example the Cayley‚ÄìHamilton theorem was proved for 2√ó2 matrices by Cayley in the aforementioned memoir, and by Hamilton for 4√ó4 matrices. Frobenius, working on bilinear forms, generalized the theorem to all dimensions (1898). Also at the end of the 19th century the Gauss‚ÄìJordan elimination (generalizing a special case now known as Gauss elimination) was established by Jordan. In the early 20th century, matrices attained a central role in linear algebra. partially due to their use in classification of the hypercomplex number systems of the previous century.
The inception of matrix mechanics by Heisenberg, Born and Jordan led to studying matrices with infinitely many rows and columns. Later, von Neumann carried out the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, by further developing functional analytic notions such as linear operators on Hilbert spaces, which, very roughly speaking, correspond to Euclidean space, but with an infinity of independent directions.
Other historical usages of the word ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù in mathematics.
The word has been used in unusual ways by at least two authors of historical importance.
Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead in their "Principia Mathematica" (1910‚Äì1913) use the word ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù in the context of their Axiom of reducibility. They proposed this axiom as a means to reduce any function to one of lower type, successively, so that at the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù (0 order) the function is identical to its extension:
For example a function Œ¶("x, y") of two variables "x" and "y" can be reduced to a "collection" of functions of a single variable, e.g., "y", by ‚Äúconsidering‚Äù the function for all possible values of ‚Äúindividuals‚Äù "ai" substituted in place of variable "x". And then the resulting collection of functions of the single variable "y", i.e., ‚àÄai: Œ¶("ai, y"), can be reduced to a ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù of values by ‚Äúconsidering‚Äù the function for all possible values of ‚Äúindividuals‚Äù "bi" substituted in place of variable "y":
Alfred Tarski in his 1946 "Introduction to Logic" used the word ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù synonymously with the notion of truth table as used in mathematical logic.

Palazzo Gabrielli-Borromeo

The Palazzo Gabrielli-Borromeo is a palazzo in Rome, Italy. It is located on Via del Seminario, between piazza di Sant'Ignazio and the Pantheon in the ancient Campus Martius and in the second sector of the present-day Colonna rione, not far from Via del Corso. 
The first palazzo on the site was built by the Gabrielli family, counts of Gubbio, whilst its second name derives from its rebuilding and redecoration by cardinal Vitaliano Borromeo for use by the Jesuits. The Jesuits in 1605 paid 20,000 scudi for the palace to use as a Seminary. The Jesuit order was suppressed during the papacy of Clement XIV. In 1774, the Monte di Piet√† of Rome purchased the palace for 32,000 scudi. In 1796, it was given to the "fabbrica di San Pietro", however by 1824, it was returned to the Jesuit order. During the 19th century, the palace ownership changed hands a number of times. Since 1853, it has been attached to Roman Catholic colleges in the city, since 1930 it has been the site of the Jesuit postgraduate institution for Jesuits, the Collegio Bellarmino. The church of San Macuto is accessed from the courtyard.

Troy King

Troy Robin King (born August 22, 1968) is the former attorney general of the state of Alabama, United States. He previously served as an assistant attorney general and a legal adviser to both Republican governors Bob Riley and Fob James. King was appointed by Governor Bob Riley in 2004, when William Pryor resigned to accept a federal judgeship. He then defeated Mobile County District Attorney John Tyson, Jr., in the 2006 election by a 54-46% margin. He sought a second term but was defeated in the Republican primary, securing 40 percent of the vote to the roughly 60 percent by Luther Strange.
Personal.
King was born in Elba, Alabama where his father was a real estate agent. King credits his interest in politics to being told at age 10 by his father that a canceled family vacation was the fault of President Jimmy Carter. He is currently married to Paige King with whom he has three children; Briggs, Colden, and Asher. He is a Baptist. King received his undergraduate degree from Troy University and is a 1994 graduate of the University of Alabama Law School.
Issues.
Pharmaceutical pricing.
In January 2005, Attorney General King filed a suit against 79 of the nation‚Äôs leading pharmaceutical companies for defrauding the state Medicaid agency. King accused the companies of misrepresenting and inflating wholesale drug costs charged to Alabama, costing hundreds of millions in overpayments by Alabama taxpayers. In April 2008, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state, allowing more than one pharmaceutical company to be tried at the same time in the proceedings, allowing the state to try the remaining cases faster. 
While the state tried at least four cases and received favorable verdicts totaling several hundred million, and negotiated settlements of $89 million, and as of May 2009, King had successfully won nearly $300 million in jury verdicts and settlements, on October 16, 2009, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the verdicts entered against the pharmaceutical companies and rendered judgment in their favor. 
"The court ruled 8-1 that the state did not have to rely on the drug companies' information in deciding what prices to pay pharmacists for prescription drugs for Medicaid recipients. The justices said state officials could have done their own research and determined the correct price."
Tracking sex offenders.
King brought attention to the need for new laws requiring the tracking of released sex offenders by wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet (the kind used by parolees and others under judicial monitoring) during the 2005 Legislative Session. He continued to wear the bracelet until the legislature passed tougher laws requiring the monitoring of parolees and convicted sex offenders.
Gambling investigation and controversy.
Background.
King made opposition to gambling a theme of his administration. In addition to successfully prosecuting several local electronic gambling operations and introducing anti-gambling legislation in every session of the legislature since becoming the attorney general, he also opposed gambling expansion the Native American tribes in Alabama. In 2006, King asked the United States Department of the Interior to deny an application by the Poarch Band of Creek Indians to expand their gaming operations in Alabama. King later filed a lawsuit against the department to keep it from pressuring Alabama to permit video gaming on Alabama reservations.
Conflict with Governor Riley.
In 2009, however, King found himself in conflict with Alabama Governor Bob Riley. Riley argued that there is no distinction between electronic bingo machines and slot machines, which are illegal in the state. King has insisted that although he objects to any form of gambling, Alabama has approved several constitutional amendments which have legalized the machines. King's office has issued an opinion in line with previous federal court rulings which establish that there can be an electronic version of common games, such as the card game, Solitaire, which can also be played on a computer. 
On June 28, 2009, the "Birmingham News" reported that King did not reference findings from the National Indian Gaming Commission in his 2004 report on gambling, which stated that some of Alabama's electronic bingo machines appeared to be class three gambling devices. King said that the only factors to consider are if the constitutional amendments approved by the citizens have legalized these machines, and whether the National Indian Gaming Commission considers the machines Class Three or Class Two is a federal designation and not relevant under Alabama law. Riley said, "I think the reason it has expanded exponentially across the state is because the attorney general has given a legitimacy or creditability by saying he thinks it is legal, and he is wrong." King said that to interpret the change of games from paper gambling to electronic gambling would be judicial activism. The Birmingham News agreed with King that the best body to decide this matter is the state's legislature, but that body had been in a deadlock over the issue for years. Both the governor and the attorney general filed briefs before the Alabama Supreme Court asking for a decision on the legality of the machines.
November 2009 Alabama Supreme Court ruling.
In November 2009 the Alabama Supreme Court released a decision on the Whitehall Bingo Case, establishing a six-point test for electronic bingo, thereby ruling that electronic bingo could exist in Alabama, but that is must meet the six-point test. Both the attorney general and the governor had mixed reactions. King felt the decision helped his position, but noted questions still lingered when he spoke to the Birmingham News: ""We have a clearer test. We do not have a clear test." More cases are expected to be filed and everyone expects the battle for electronic bingo to continue. The next week, King issued a letter to the state's district attorneys, asking them to enforce the new test issued by the Supreme Court, saying he was confident that they would do so. More challenges and more lawsuits were expected and King reiterated his feeling that the only long term solution to gambling is for the Legislature to "give the people of Alabama the chance to vote yes or no."
May 2010 Alabama Supreme Court ruling.
On May 21, 2010, the Alabama Supreme Court handed down a finalized ruling that answered lingering questions in the gambling debate between King and Governor Riley. The court's ruling had two components: first, that the governor does indeed maintain the constitutional authority to approve law enforcement actions without the approval of the attorney general, and second, that any law enforcement operation conceived and operated by the governor cannot be seized by the attorney general, and any previously seized operations must be immediately turned over to the governor's appointed special counsel.
The relevant section of the Supreme Court ruling states that "we hold that the actions of the attorneys and other officers authorized by Governor Riley to act in this case are not ‚Äúnullities,‚Äù despite the lack of approval by the attorney general and the district attorney, and that the attorney general may not take over or countermand the litigation efforts of those officers in either the trial court or in this Court. The counsel authorized by the governor have the right to represent the state in this case and to see it through to completion." 
Death penalty stance.
King is also a staunch proponent of the death penalty. When many states voluntarily suspended executions during U.S. Supreme Court litigation over lethal injection, King continued to seek setting execution dates in Alabama. King's support of the death penalty created a controversy when, in 2007, a district attorney in suburban Birmingham supported commuting the death sentence of an accomplice in a case in which the actual shooter had escaped the death penalty because he was a juvenile. King received support in the controversy from the victim's family, and from death penalty supporters, for his stance efforts to seek the death penalty for the accomplice. The incident led a wide, bipartisan coalition of local district attorneys, as well as newspaper editorials, to criticize King. In 2009 Troy King's campaign launched a video: "Pushing For The Death Penalty." In this video, he says that the death penalty is the greatest deterrent to violent crime, citing a recent study he claims shows that for every execution, 75 murders are prevented.
Voter fraud investigations.
King launched a series of voter fraud investigations as a result of complaints following state and local elections. The probe included an indictment against the Hale County former circuit clerk, officials in Evergreen following a municipal election and Perry County officials following complaints registered with the Secretary of State after the mayoral runoff in Marion. King also launched investigations into Bullock, Jackson and Lowndes counties but claimed obstruction by the federal government, prompting the Mobile Press-Register to publish an editorial calling for the Department of Justice to cooperate with King. Voter fraud is still a hot-button issue in Alabama.
Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1998.
After his appointment as attorney general in 2004, King replaced former Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor as defendant in the case of "Williams v. Morgan". This case unsuccessfully sought to enjoin the state of Alabama from enforcing the Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1998, a law prohibiting the sale of any ‚Äúdevice designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs,‚Äù commonly known as ‚Äúsex toys.‚Äù As the state's attorney general, King defended the law. King‚Äôs defense in the litigation, was praised by religious conservatives, but it also subjected him to considerable criticism from editorial writers and civil liberties advocates, one of which mailed King an inflatable pig sex toy. The latter incident became fodder for numerous editorial cartoons.
Formal recusal of the Attorney General's Office while investigating Alabama community college system.
In late 2006, King was forced to recuse his entire office from the ongoing investigation of abuses in the Alabama community college system when it emerged that he had asked community college chancellor Roy Johnson to hire the mother of one of King's employees. It later emerged that King had also asked Johnson for community college system financial support for Victims of Crime and Leniency (VOCAL), an international advocacy group composed of Alabama families who have been addressing crime victims' needs ‚Äîand a group which has supported King. King's office continued to provide investigative support, which resulted in a guilty plea by Johnson in the related federal investigation.
Accusations of improper receipt and gift reporting.
In early 2007, an investigative article published by "The Birmingham News" revealed that King and a group from his church had accepted free tickets, food and skybox access to an Atlanta Braves baseball game from Alabama Power Company the previous season. Alabama Power had not reported the gifts to appropriate ethics agencies, as required, until contacted by the "News". King attended the game with his family and church friends. The total food bill was more than $1,200 for everyone in King's group, plus others in attendance. The skybox normally rented for $2,400 a day. Because King, as attorney general, was legally responsible for representing Alabama Power customers before the Alabama Public Service Commission he was criticized by "The Birmingham News" for accepting the gifts. King reimbursed Alabama Power $486 for his family's food, but did not reimburse it for food eaten by the company's other guests, including his church group. King denied wrongdoing in the matter and argued that Alabama Power was responsible for reporting the matter and should have done so appropriately.
Anthony Castaldo perjury incident.
Later in 2007, Anthony Castaldo, a former investigator with the attorney general's office was charged with perjury by District Attorney David Barber. During the trial, Castaldo submitted an affidavit that King ordered him to investigate a Birmingham-area judge for political reasons. Castaldo also alleged that he was punished when a year-long investigation showed no evidence of wrongdoing by the judge. After other investigators took over the case, King secured an indictment against the judge, but the charges against the judge were later dismissed. Castaldo was acquitted of the perjury charge and later resigned his position within the attorney general's office.
Staff salaries.
In 2008, an investigative story by "The Birmingham News" reviewed the salaries paid by King to members of his staff. One aide to King was being paid $57,504 a year‚Äì-almost the salary for starting lawyers‚Äîwithin three months of graduating from college. This staffer was initially paid $39,456 a year as an "intern" while still enrolled in college. The department's chief of staff said that the aide in question traveled extensively with the attorney general and "is almost indispensable in terms of the many functions he carries out in this office." King's salary of $164,000 is tied by law to that of the Supreme Court Justices who, along with King, are among the highest paid in the nation. King was criticized in a newspaper editorial by "The Montgomery Advertiser" saying the salaries were "out of line for their experience and qualifications." King did not change the salaries.
Gasoline price gouging investigation.
In September 2008, in the aftermath of hurricanes Gustav and Ike, King's office began processing more than 2,500 complaints regarding gasoline prices under Alabama's price gouging statutes. A month later, a King spokesman said the investigations remained "ongoing" as the prices begin to return to lower levels.
Defeated in race for second term.
After having been mentioned as a possible gubernatorial candidate in 2010, King announced his re-election campaign for attorney general on March 9, 2009. King was an early supporter of the 2008 presidential campaign of Arizona Senator John McCain and served as the Alabama chair of the McCain campaign. King was defeated in a landslide by Luther Strange in the GOP primary on June 1, 2010.

Higgs boson

The Higgs boson or Higgs particle is an elementary particle initially theorised in 1964, whose discovery was announced at CERN on 4 July 2012, and confirmed likely to be a Higgs boson in March 2013. The discovery has been called "monumental" because it appears to confirm the existence of the Higgs field, which is pivotal to the Standard Model and other theories within particle physics. It would explain why some fundamental particles have mass when the symmetries controlling their interactions should require them to be massless, and why the weak force has a much shorter range than the electromagnetic force. The discovery of a Higgs boson should allow physicists to finally validate the last untested area of the Standard Model's approach to fundamental particles and forces, guide other theories and discoveries in particle physics, and potentially lead to developments in "new" physics.
This unanswered question in fundamental physics is of such importance that it led to a search of more than 40 years for the Higgs boson and finally the construction of one of the world's most expensive and complex experimental facilities to date, the Large Hadron Collider, able to create Higgs bosons and other particles for observation and study. On 4 July 2012, it was announced that a previously unknown particle with a mass between 125 and (134.2 and 136.3 amu) had been detected; physicists suspected at the time that it was the Higgs boson. By March 2013, the particle had been proven to behave, interact and decay in many of the ways predicted by the Standard Model, and was also tentatively confirmed to have positive parity and zero spin, two fundamental attributes of a Higgs boson. This appears to be the first elementary scalar particle discovered in nature. More data is needed to know if the discovered particle exactly matches the predictions of the Standard Model, or whether, as predicted by some theories, multiple Higgs bosons exist.
The Higgs boson is named after Peter Higgs, one of six physicists who, in 1964, proposed the mechanism that suggested the existence of such a particle. Although Higgs's name has come to be associated with this theory, several researchers between about 1960 and 1972 each independently developed different parts of it. In mainstream media the Higgs boson has often been called the "God particle", from ; the nickname is strongly disliked by many physicists, including Higgs, who regard it as inappropriate sensationalism. In 2013 two of the original researchers, Peter Higgs and Fran√ßois Englert, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work and prediction (Englert's co-researcher Robert Brout had died in 2011).
In the Standard Model, the Higgs particle is a boson with no spin, electric charge, or color charge. It is also very unstable, decaying into other particles almost immediately. It is a quantum excitation of one of the four components of the Higgs field. The latter constitutes a scalar field, with two neutral and two electrically charged components, and forms a complex doublet of the weak isospin SU(2) symmetry. The field has a "Mexican hat" shaped potential with nonzero strength everywhere (including otherwise empty space) which in its vacuum state breaks the weak isospin symmetry of the electroweak interaction. When this happens, three components of the Higgs field are "absorbed" by the SU(2) and U(1) gauge bosons (the "Higgs mechanism") to become the longitudinal components of the now-massive W and Z bosons of the weak force. The remaining electrically neutral component separately couples to other particles known as fermions (via Yukawa couplings), causing these to acquire mass as well. Some versions of the theory predict more than one kind of Higgs fields and bosons. Alternative "Higgsless" models would have been considered if the Higgs boson were not discovered.
A non-technical summary.
Overview.
In particle physics, elementary particles and forces give rise to the world around us. Nowadays, physicists explain the behaviour of these particles and how they interact using the Standard Model‚Äîa widely accepted and "remarkably" accurate framework based on gauge invariance and symmetries, believed to explain almost everything in the world we see, other than gravity.
But by around 1960 all attempts to create a gauge invariant theory for two of the four fundamental forces had consistently failed at one crucial point: although gauge invariance seemed extremely important, it seemed to make any theory of electromagnetism and the weak force go haywire, by demanding that either many particles with mass were massless or that non-existent forces and massless particles had to exist. Scientists had no idea how to get past this point.
Work done on superconductivity and "broken" symmetries around 1960 led physicist Philip Anderson to suggest in 1962 a new kind of solution that might hold the key. In 1964 a theory was created by 3 different groups of researchers, that showed the problems could be resolved if an unusual kind of field existed throughout the universe. It would cause existing particles to acquire mass instead of new massless particles being formed. By 1972 it had been developed into a comprehensive theory and proved capable of giving "sensible" results. Although there was not yet any proof of such a field, calculations consistently gave answers and predictions that were confirmed by experiments, including very accurate predictions of several other particles, so scientists began to believe this might be true and to search for proof whether or not a Higgs field exists in nature.
If this field did exist, this would be a monumental discovery for science and human knowledge, and is expected to open doorways to new knowledge in many fields. If not, then other more complicated theories would need to be explored. The easiest proof whether or not the field existed was by searching for a new kind of particle it would have to give off, known as "Higgs bosons" or the "Higgs particle". These would be extremely difficult to find, so it was only many years later that experimental technology became sophisticated enough to answer the question.
While several symmetries in nature are spontaneously broken through a form of the Higgs mechanism, in the context of the Standard Model the term "Higgs mechanism" almost always means symmetry breaking of the electroweak field. It is considered proven, but the exact cause has been exceedingly difficult to prove. After 50 years, the Higgs boson's existence ‚Äì apparently proven in 2013 ‚Äì would finally confirm that the Standard Model is essentially correct and allow further development, while its non-existence would mean that other theories are needed instead.
Various analogies have also been invented to describe the Higgs field and boson, including analogies with well-known symmetry breaking effects such as the rainbow and prism, electric fields, ripples, and resistance of macro objects moving through media, like people moving through crowds or some objects moving through syrup or molasses. However, analogies based on simple resistance to motion are inaccurate as the Higgs field does not work by resisting motion.
Significance.
Scientific impact.
Evidence of the Higgs field and its properties would be extremely significant scientifically, for many reasons. The Higgs boson's importance is largely that it is able to be examined using existing knowledge and experimental technology, as a way to confirm and study the entire Higgs field theory. Conversely, proof that the Higgs field and boson do not exist would also be significant. In discussion form, the relevance includes:
"Real world" impact.
As yet, there are no known immediate technological benefits of finding the Higgs particle. However, observers in both media and science point out that when fundamental discoveries are made about our world, their practical uses can take decades to emerge, but are often world-changing when they do. A common pattern for fundamental discoveries is for practical applications to follow later, once the discovery has been explored further, at which point they become the basis for social change and new technologies.
For example, in the first half of the 20th century it was not expected that quantum mechanics would make possible transistors and microchips, mobile phones and computers, lasers and M.R.I. scanners. Radio waves were described by their co-discoverer in 1888 as "an interesting laboratory experiment" with "no useful purpose" whatsoever, and are now used in innumerable ways (radar, weather prediction, medicine, television, wireless computing and emergency response), positrons are used in hospital tomography scans, and special and general relativity which explain black holes also enable satellite-based GPS and satellite navigation ("satnav"). Electric power generation and transmission, motors, and lighting all stemmed from previous theoretical work on electricity and magnetism; air conditioning and refrigeration resulted from thermodynamics. It is impossible to predict how seemingly esoteric knowledge may affect society in the future.
Other observers highlight technological spin-offs from this and related particle physics activities, which have already brought major developments to society. For example, the World Wide Web as used today was created by physicists working in global collaborations on particle experiments at CERN to share their results, and the results of massive amounts of data produced by the Large Hadron Collider have already led to significant advances in distributed and cloud computing, now well established within mainstream services.
History.
Particle physicists study matter made from fundamental particles whose interactions are mediated by exchange particles - gauge bosons - acting as force carriers. At the beginning of the 1960s a number of these particles had been discovered or proposed, along with theories suggesting how they relate to each other, some of which had already been reformulated as field theories in which the objects of study are not particles and forces, but quantum fields and their symmetries. However, attempts to unify known fundamental forces such as the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force were known to be incomplete. One known omission was that gauge invariant approaches, including non-abelian models such as Yang‚ÄìMills theory (1954), which held great promise for unified theories, also seemed to predict known massive particles as massless. Goldstone's theorem, relating to continuous symmetries within some theories, also appeared to rule out many obvious solutions, since it appeared to show that zero-mass particles would have to also exist that were "simply not seen". According to Guralnik, physicists had "no understanding" how these problems could be overcome.
Particle physicist and mathematician Peter Woit summarised the state of research at the time:
The Higgs mechanism is a process by which vector bosons can get rest mass "without" explicitly breaking gauge invariance, as a byproduct of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The mathematical theory behind spontaneous symmetry breaking was initially conceived and published within particle physics by Yoichiro Nambu in 1960, the concept that such a mechanism could offer a possible solution for the "mass problem" was originally suggested in 1962 by Philip Anderson (who had previously written papers on broken symmetry and its outcomes in superconductivity and concluded in his 1963 paper on Yang-Mills theory that ""considering the superconducting analog... hese two types of bosons seem capable of canceling each other out... leaving finite mass bosons""), and Abraham Klein and Benjamin Lee showed in March 1964 that Goldstone's theorem could be avoided this way in at least some non-relativistic cases and speculated it might be possible in truly relativistic cases.
These approaches were quickly developed into a full relativistic model, independently and almost simultaneously, by three groups of physicists: by Fran√ßois Englert and Robert Brout in August 1964; by Peter Higgs in October 1964; and by Gerald Guralnik, Carl Hagen, and Tom Kibble (GHK) in November 1964. Higgs also wrote a short but important response published in September 1964 to an objection by Gilbert, which showed that if calculating within the radiation gauge, Goldstone's theorem and Gilbert's objection would become inapplicable. (Higgs later described Gilbert's objection as prompting his own paper.) Properties of the model were further considered by Guralnik in 1965, by Higgs in 1966, by Kibble in 1967, and further by GHK in 1967. The original three 1964 papers showed that when a gauge theory is combined with an additional field that spontaneously breaks the symmetry, the gauge bosons can consistently acquire a finite mass. In 1967, Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam independently showed how a Higgs mechanism could be used to break the electroweak symmetry of Sheldon Glashow's unified model for the weak and electromagnetic interactions (itself an extension of work by Schwinger), forming what became the Standard Model of particle physics. Weinberg was the first to observe that this would also provide mass terms for the fermions.¬†
However, the seminal papers on spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetries were at first largely ignored, because it was widely believed that the (non-Abelian gauge) theories in question were a dead-end, and in particular that they could not be renormalised. In 1971‚Äì72, Martinus Veltman and Gerard 't Hooft proved renormalisation of Yang‚ÄìMills was possible in two papers covering massless, and then massive, fields. Their contribution, and others' work on the renormalization group - including "substantial" theoretical work by Russian physicists - was eventually "enormously profound and influential", but even with all key elements of the eventual theory published there was still almost no wider interest. For example, Coleman found in a study that "essentially no-one paid any attention" to Weinberg's paper prior to 1971 ‚Äì now the most cited in particle physics ‚Äì and even in 1970 according to Politzer, Glashow's teaching of the weak interaction contained no mention of Weinberg's, Salam's, or Glashow's own work. In practice, Politzer states, almost everyone learned of the theory due to physicist Benjamin Lee, who combined the work of Veltman and 't Hooft with insights by others, and popularised the completed theory. In this way, from 1971, interest and acceptance "exploded"¬† and the ideas were quickly absorbed in the mainstream.
The resulting electroweak theory and Standard Model have correctly predicted (among other discoveries) weak neutral currents, three bosons, the top and charm quarks, and with great precision, the mass and other properties of some of these. Many of those involved eventually won Nobel Prizes or other renowned awards. A 1974 paper and comprehensive review in "Reviews of Modern Physics" commented that "while no one doubted the correctness of these arguments, no one quite believed that nature was diabolically clever enough to take advantage of them", adding that the theory had so far produced meaningful answers that accorded with experiment, but it was unknown whether the theory was actually correct. By 1986 and again in the 1990s it became possible to write that understanding and proving the Higgs sector of the Standard Model was "the central problem today in particle physics."¬†
Summary and impact of the PRL papers.
The three papers written in 1964 were each recognised as milestone papers during "Physical Review Letters" 50th anniversary celebration. Their six authors were also awarded the 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics for this work. (A controversy also arose the same year, because in the event of a Nobel Prize only up to three scientists could be recognised, with six being credited for the papers. ) Two of the three PRL papers (by Higgs and by GHK) contained equations for the hypothetical field that eventually would become known as the Higgs field and its hypothetical quantum, the Higgs boson. Higgs' subsequent 1966 paper showed the decay mechanism of the boson; only a massive boson can decay and the decays can prove the mechanism.
In the paper by Higgs the boson is massive, and in a closing sentence Higgs writes that "an essential feature" of the theory "is the prediction of incomplete multiplets of scalar and vector bosons". (Frank Close comments that 1960s gauge theorists were focused on the problem of massless "vector" bosons, and the implied existence of a massive "scalar" boson was not seen as important; only Higgs directly addressed it.) In the paper by GHK the boson is massless and decoupled from the massive states. In reviews dated 2009 and 2011, Guralnik states that in the GHK model the boson is massless only in a lowest-order approximation, but it is not subject to any constraint and acquires mass at higher orders, and adds that the GHK paper was the only one to show that there are no massless Goldstone bosons in the model and to give a complete analysis of the general Higgs mechanism. All three reached similar conclusions, despite their very different approaches: Higgs' paper essentially used classical techniques, Englert and Brout's involved calculating vacuum polarization in perturbation theory around an assumed symmetry-breaking vacuum state, and GHK used operator formalism and conservation laws to explore in depth the ways in which Goldstone's theorem may be worked around.
In addition to explaining how mass is acquired by vector bosons, the Higgs mechanism also predicts the ratio between the W boson and Z boson masses as well as their couplings with each other and with the Standard Model quarks and leptons. Subsequently, many of these predictions have been verified by precise measurements performed at the LEP and the SLC colliders, thus overwhelmingly confirming that some kind of Higgs mechanism does take place in nature, but the exact manner by which it happens has not yet been discovered. The results of searching for the Higgs boson are expected to provide evidence about how this is realized in nature.
Theoretical properties.
Theoretical need for the Higgs.
Gauge invariance is an important property of modern particle theories such as the Standard Model, partly due to its success in other areas of fundamental physics such as electromagnetism and the strong interaction (quantum chromodynamics). However, there were great difficulties in developing gauge theories for the weak nuclear force or a possible unified electroweak interaction. Fermions with a mass term would violate gauge symmetry and therefore cannot be gauge invariant. (This can be seen by examining the Dirac Lagrangian for a fermion in terms of left and right handed components; we find none of the spin-half particles could ever flip helicity as required for mass, so they must be massless.) W and Z bosons are observed to have mass, but a boson mass term contains terms which clearly depend on the choice of gauge and therefore these masses too cannot be gauge invariant. Therefore it seems that "none" of the standard model fermions "or" bosons could "begin" with mass as an inbuilt property except by abandoning gauge invariance. If gauge invariance were to be retained, then these particles had to be acquiring their mass by some other mechanism or interaction. Additionally, whatever was giving these particles their mass, had to not "break" gauge invariance as the basis for other parts of the theories where it worked well, "and" had to not require or predict unexpected massless particles and long-range forces (seemingly an inevitable consequence of Goldstone's theorem) which did not actually seem to exist in nature.
A solution to all of these overlapping problems came from the discovery of a previously unnoticed borderline case hidden in the mathematics of Goldstone's theorem, that under certain conditions it "might" theoretically be possible for a symmetry to be broken "without" disrupting gauge invariance and "without" any new massless particles or forces, and having "sensible" (renormalisable) results mathematically: this became known as the Higgs mechanism.
The Standard Model hypothesizes a field which is responsible for this effect, called the Higgs field (symbol: formula_1), which has the unusual property of a non-zero amplitude in its ground state; i.e., a non-zero vacuum expectation value. It can have this effect because of its unusual "Mexican hat" shaped potential whose lowest "point" is not at its "centre". Below a certain extremely high energy level the existence of this non-zero vacuum expectation spontaneously breaks electroweak gauge symmetry which in turn gives rise to the Higgs mechanism and triggers the acquisition of mass by those particles interacting with the field. This effect occurs because scalar field components of the Higgs field are "absorbed" by the massive bosons as degrees of freedom, and couple to the fermions via Yukawa coupling, thereby producing the expected mass terms. In effect when symmetry breaks under these conditions, the Goldstone bosons that arise "interact" with the Higgs field (and with other particles capable of interacting with the Higgs field) instead of becoming new massless particles, the intractable problems of both underlying theories "neutralise" each other, and the residual outcome is that elementary particles acquire a consistent mass based on how strongly they interact with the Higgs field. It is the simplest known process capable of giving mass to the gauge bosons while remaining compatible with gauge theories. Its quantum would be a scalar boson, known as the Higgs boson.
Properties of the Standard Model Higgs.
In the Standard Model, the Higgs field consists of four components, two neutral ones and two charged component fields. Both of the charged components and one of the neutral fields are Goldstone bosons, which act as the longitudinal third-polarization components of the massive W+, W‚Äì, and Z bosons. The quantum of the remaining neutral component corresponds to (and is theoretically realised as) the massive Higgs boson. Since the Higgs field is a scalar field (meaning it does not transform under Lorentz transformations), the Higgs boson has no spin. The Higgs boson is also its own antiparticle and is CP-even, and has zero electric and colour charge.
The Minimal Standard Model does not predict the mass of the Higgs boson. If that mass is between 115 and , then the Standard Model can be valid at energy scales all the way up to the Planck scale (1019 GeV). Many theorists expect new physics beyond the Standard Model to emerge at the TeV-scale, based on unsatisfactory properties of the Standard Model. The highest possible mass scale allowed for the Higgs boson (or some other electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism) is 1.4 TeV; beyond this point, the Standard Model becomes inconsistent without such a mechanism, because unitarity is violated in certain scattering processes.
It is also possible, although experimentally difficult, to estimate the mass of the Higgs boson indirectly. In the Standard Model, the Higgs boson has a number of indirect effects; most notably, Higgs loops result in tiny corrections to masses of W and Z bosons. Precision measurements of electroweak parameters, such as the Fermi constant and masses of W/Z bosons, can be used to calculate constraints on the mass of the Higgs. As of July 2011, the precision electroweak measurements tell us that the mass of the Higgs boson is likely to be less than about at 95% confidence level (this upper limit would increase to if the lower bound of from the LEP-2 direct search is allowed for). These indirect constraints rely on the assumption that the Standard Model is correct. It may still be possible to discover a Higgs boson above these masses if it is accompanied by other particles beyond those predicted by the Standard Model.
Production.
If Higgs particle theories are correct, then a Higgs particle can be produced much like other particles that are studied, in a particle collider. This involves accelerating a large number of particles to extremely high energies and extremely close to the speed of light, then allowing them to smash together. Protons and lead ions (the bare nuclei of lead atoms) are used at the LHC. In the extreme energies of these collisions, the desired esoteric particles will occasionally be produced and this can be detected and studied; any absence or difference from theoretical expectations can also be used to improve the theory. The relevant particle theory (in this case the Standard Model) will determine the necessary kinds of collisions and detectors. The Standard Model predicts that Higgs bosons could be formed in a number of ways, although the probability of producing a Higgs boson in any collision is always expected to be very small‚Äîfor example, only 1 Higgs boson per 10 billion collisions in the Large Hadron Collider. The most common expected processes for Higgs boson production are:
Decay.
Quantum mechanics predicts that if it is possible for a particle to decay into a set of lighter particles, then it will eventually do so. This is also true for the Higgs boson. The likelihood with which this happens depends on a variety of factors including: the difference in mass, the strength of the interactions, etc. Most of these factors are fixed by the Standard Model, except for the mass of the Higgs boson itself. For a Higgs boson with a mass of the SM predicts a mean life time of about .
Since it interacts with all the massive elementary particles of the SM, the Higgs boson has many different processes through which it can decay. Each of these possible processes has its own probability, expressed as the "branching ratio"; the fraction of the total number decays that follows that process. The SM predicts these branching ratios as a function of the Higgs mass (see plot).
One way that the Higgs can decay is by splitting into a fermion‚Äìantifermion pair. As general rule, the Higgs is more likely to decay into heavy fermions than light fermions, because the mass of a fermion is proportional to the strength of its interaction with the Higgs. By this logic the most common decay should be into a top‚Äìantitop quark pair. However, such a decay is only possible if the Higgs is heavier than ~, twice the mass of the top quark. For a Higgs mass of the SM predicts that the most common decay is into a bottom‚Äìantibottom quark pair, which happens 56.1% of the time. The second most common fermion decay at that mass is a tau‚Äìantitau pair, which happens only about 6% of the time.
Another possibility is for the Higgs to split into a pair of massive gauge bosons. The most likely possibility is for the Higgs to decay into a pair of W bosons (the light blue line in the plot), which happens about 23.1% of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of . The W bosons can subsequently decay either into a quark and an antiquark or into a charged lepton and a neutrino. However, the decays of W bosons into quarks are difficult to distinguish from the background, and the decays into leptons cannot be fully reconstructed (because neutrinos are impossible to detect in particle collision experiments). A cleaner signal is given by decay into a pair of Z-bosons (which happens about 2.9% of the time for a Higgs with a mass of ), if each of the bosons subsequently decays into a pair of easy-to-detect charged leptons (electrons or muons).
Decay into massless gauge bosons (i.e., gluons or photons) is also possible, but requires intermediate loop of virtual heavy quarks (top or bottom) or massive gauge bosons. The most common such process is the decay into a pair of gluons through a loop of virtual heavy quarks. This process, which is the reverse of the gluon fusion process mentioned above, happens approximately 8.5% of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of . Much rarer is the decay into a pair of photons mediated by a loop of W bosons or heavy quarks, which happens only twice for every thousand decays. However, this process is very relevant for experimental searches for the Higgs boson, because the energy and momentum of the photons can be measured very precisely, giving an accurate reconstruction of the mass of the decaying particle.
Alternative models.
The Minimal Standard Model as described above is the simplest known model for the Higgs mechanism with just one Higgs field. However, an extended Higgs sector with additional Higgs particle doublets or triplets is also possible, and many extensions of the Standard Model have this feature. The non-minimal Higgs sector favoured by theory are the two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM), which predict the existence of a quintet of scalar particles: two CP-even neutral Higgs bosons h0 and H0, a CP-odd neutral Higgs boson A0, and two charged Higgs particles H¬±. Supersymmetry ("SUSY") also predicts relations between the Higgs-boson masses and the masses of the gauge bosons, and could accommodate a neutral Higgs boson.
The key method to distinguish between these different models involves study of the particles' interactions ("coupling") and exact decay processes ("branching ratios"), which can be measured and tested experimentally in particle collisions. In the Type-I 2HDM model one Higgs doublet couples to up and down quarks, while the second doublet does not couple to quarks. This model has two interesting limits, in which the lightest Higgs couples to just fermions ("gauge-phobic") or just gauge bosons ("fermiophobic"), but not both. In the Type-II 2HDM model, one Higgs doublet only couples to up-type quarks, the other only couples to down-type quarks. The heavily researched Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) includes a Type-II 2HDM Higgs sector, so it could be disproven by evidence of a Type-I 2HDM Higgs.
In other models the Higgs scalar is a composite particle. For example, in technicolor the role of the Higgs field is played by strongly bound pairs of fermions called techniquarks. Other models, feature pairs of top quarks (see top quark condensate). In yet other models, there is no Higgs field at all and the electroweak symmetry is broken using extra dimensions.
Further theoretical issues and hierarchy problem.
The Standard Model leaves the mass of the Higgs boson as a parameter to be measured, rather than a value to be calculated. This is seen as theoretically unsatisfactory, particularly as quantum corrections (related to interactions with virtual particles) should apparently cause the Higgs particle to have a mass immensely higher than that observed, but at the same time the Standard Model requires a mass of the order of 100 to 1000 GeV to ensure unitarity (in this case, to unitarise longitudinal vector boson scattering). Reconciling these points appears to require explaining why there is an almost-perfect cancellation resulting in the visible mass of ~ 125 GeV, and it is not clear how to do this. Because the weak force is about 1032 times stronger than gravity, and (linked to this) the Higgs boson's mass is so much less than the Planck mass or the grand unification energy, it appears that either there is some underlying connection or reason for these observations which is unknown and not described by the Standard Model, or some unexplained and extremely precise fine-tuning of parameters ‚Äì however at present neither of these explanations is proven. This is known as a hierarchy problem. More broadly, the hierarchy problem amounts to the worry that a future theory of fundamental particles and interactions should not have excessive fine-tunings or unduly delicate cancellations, and should allow masses of particles such as the Higgs boson to be calculable. The problem is in some ways unique to spin-0 particles (such as the Higgs boson), which can give rise to issues related to quantum corrections that do not affect particles with spin. A number of solutions have been proposed, including supersymmetry, conformal solutions and solutions via extra dimensions such as braneworld models.
Experimental search.
To produce Higgs bosons, two beams of particles are accelerated to very high energies and allowed to collide within a particle detector. Occasionally, although rarely, a Higgs boson will be created fleetingly as part of the collision byproducts. Because the Higgs boson decays very quickly, particle detectors cannot detect it directly. Instead the detectors register all the decay products (the "decay signature") and from the data the decay process is reconstructed. If the observed decay products match a possible decay process (known as a "decay channel") of a Higgs boson, this indicates that a Higgs boson may have been created. In practice, many processes may produce similar decay signatures. Fortunately, the Standard Model precisely predicts the likelihood of each of these, and each known process, occurring. So, if the detector detects more decay signatures consistently matching a Higgs boson than would otherwise be expected if Higgs bosons did not exist, then this would be strong evidence that the Higgs boson exists.
Because Higgs boson production in a particle collision is likely to be very rare (1 in 10 billion at the LHC), and many other possible collision events can have similar decay signatures, the data of hundreds of trillions of collisions needs to be analysed and must "show the same picture" before a conclusion about the existence of the Higgs boson can be reached. To conclude that a new particle has been found, particle physicists require that the statistical analysis of two independent particle detectors each indicate that there is lesser than a one-in-a-million chance that the observed decay signatures are due to just background random Standard Model events‚Äîi.e., that the observed number of events is more than 5 standard deviations (sigma) different from that expected if there was no new particle. More collision data allows better confirmation of the physical properties of any new particle observed, and allows physicists to decide whether it is indeed a Higgs boson as described by the Standard Model or some other hypothetical new particle.
To find the Higgs boson, a powerful particle accelerator was needed, because Higgs bosons might not be seen in lower-energy experiments. The collider needed to have a high luminosity in order to ensure enough collisions were seen for conclusions to be drawn. Finally, advanced computing facilities were needed to process the vast amount of data (25 petabytes per year as at 2012) produced by the collisions. For the announcement of 4 July 2012, a new collider known as the Large Hadron Collider was constructed at CERN with a planned eventual collision energy of 14 TeV‚Äîover seven times any previous collider‚Äîand over 300 trillion (3√ó1014) LHC proton‚Äìproton collisions were analysed by the LHC Computing Grid, the world's largest computing grid (as of 2012), comprising over 170 computing facilities in a worldwide network across 36 countries.
Search prior to 4 July 2012.
The first extensive search for the Higgs boson was conducted at the Large Electron‚ÄìPositron Collider (LEP) at CERN in the 1990s. At the end of its service in 2000, LEP had found no conclusive evidence for the Higgs. This implied that if the Higgs boson were to exist it would have to be heavier than .
The search continued at Fermilab in the United States, where the Tevatron‚Äîthe collider that discovered the top quark in 1995‚Äîhad been upgraded for this purpose. There was no guarantee that the Tevatron would be able to find the Higgs, but it was the only supercollider that was operational since the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was still under construction and the planned Superconducting Super Collider had been cancelled in 1993 and never completed. The Tevatron was only able to exclude further ranges for the Higgs mass, and was shut down on 30 September 2011 because it no longer could keep up with the LHC. The final analysis of the data excluded the possibility of a Higgs boson with a mass between and . In addition, there was a small (but not significant) excess of events possibly indicating a Higgs boson with a mass between and .
The Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, was designed specifically to be able to either confirm or exclude the existence of the Higgs boson. Built in a 27¬†km tunnel under the ground near Geneva originally inhabited by LEP, it was designed to collide two beams of protons, initially at energies of per beam (7¬†TeV total), or almost 3.6 times that of the Tevatron, and upgradeable to (14¬†TeV total) in future. Theory suggested if the Higgs boson existed, collisions at these energy levels should be able to reveal it. As one of the most complicated scientific instruments ever built, its operational readiness was delayed for 14 months by a magnet quench event nine days after its inaugural tests, caused by a faulty electrical connection that damaged over 50 superconducting magnets and contaminated the vacuum system.
Data collection at the LHC finally commenced in March 2010. By December 2011 the two main particle detectors at the LHC, ATLAS and CMS, had narrowed down the mass range where the Higgs could exist to around 116-130 GeV (ATLAS) and 115-127 GeV (CMS). There had also already been a number of promising event excesses that had "evaporated" and proven to be nothing but random fluctuations. However from around May 2011, both experiments had seen among their results, the slow emergence of a small yet consistent excess of gamma and 4-lepton decay signatures and several other particle decays, all hinting at a new particle at a mass around . By around November 2011, the anomalous data at 125¬†GeV was becoming "too large to ignore" (although still far from conclusive), and the team leaders at both ATLAS and CMS each privately suspected they might have found the Higgs. On November 28, 2011, at an internal meeting of the two team leaders and the director general of CERN, the latest analyses were discussed outside their teams for the first time, suggesting both ATLAS and CMS might be converging on a possible shared result at 125¬†GeV, and initial preparations commenced in case of a successful finding. While this information was not known publicly at the time, the narrowing of the possible Higgs range to around 115‚Äì130 GeV and the repeated observation of small but consistent event excesses across multiple channels at both ATLAS and CMS in the 124-126 GeV region (described as "tantalising hints" of around 2-3 sigma) were public knowledge with "a lot of interest". It was therefore widely anticipated around the end of 2011, that the LHC would provide sufficient data to either exclude or confirm the finding of a Higgs boson by the end of 2012, when their 2012 collision data (with slightly higher 8¬†TeV collision energy) had been examined.
Discovery of candidate boson at CERN.
On 22 June 2012 CERN announced an upcoming seminar covering tentative findings for 2012, and shortly afterwards (from around 1 July 2012 according to an analysis of the spreading rumour in social media) rumours began to spread in the media that this would include a major announcement, but it was unclear whether this would be a stronger signal or a formal discovery. Speculation escalated to a "fevered" pitch when reports emerged that Peter Higgs, who proposed the particle, was to be attending the seminar, and that "five leading physicists" had been invited ‚Äì generally believed to signify the five living 1964 authors ‚Äì with Higgs, Englert, Guralnik, Hagen attending and Kibble confirming his invitation (Brout having died in 2011).)
On 4 July 2012 both of the CERN experiments announced they had independently made the same discovery: CMS of a previously unknown boson with mass 125.3 ¬± 0.6 GeV/"c"2 and ATLAS of a boson with mass 126.5 GeV/"c"2.
Using the combined analysis of two interaction types (known as 'channels'), both experiments reached a local significance of 5-sigma‚Äîor less than a 1 in one million chance of error. When additional channels were taken into account, the CMS significance was reduced to 4.9-sigma.
The two teams had been working 'blinded' from each other from around late 2011 or early 2012, meaning they did not discuss their results with each other, providing additional certainty that any common finding was genuine validation of a particle. This level of evidence, confirmed independently by two separate teams and experiments, meets the formal level of proof required to announce a confirmed discovery.
On 31 July 2012, the ATLAS collaboration presented additional data analysis on the "observation of a new particle", including data from a third channel, which improved the significance to and mass , and CMS improved the significance to 5-sigma and mass .
The new particle tested as a possible Higgs boson.
Following the 2012 discovery, it was still unconfirmed whether or not the 125 GeV/"c"2 particle was a Higgs boson. On one hand, observations remained consistent with the observed particle being the Standard Model Higgs boson, and the particle decayed into at least some of the predicted channels. Moreover, the production rates and branching ratios for the observed channels broadly matched the predictions by the Standard Model within the experimental uncertainties. However, the experimental uncertainties currently still left room for alternative explanations, meaning an announcement of the discovery of a Higgs boson would have been premature. To allow more opportunity for data collection, the LHC's proposed 2012 shutdown and 2013‚Äì14 upgrade were postponed by 7 weeks into 2013.
In November 2012, in a conference in Kyoto researchers said evidence gathered since July was falling into line with the basic Standard Model more than its alternatives, with a range of results for several interactions matching that theory's predictions. Physicist Matt Strassler highlighted "considerable" evidence that the new particle is not a pseudoscalar negative parity particle (consistent with this required finding for a Higgs boson), "evaporation" or lack of increased significance for previous hints of non-Standard Model findings, expected Standard Model interactions with W and Z bosons, absence of "significant new implications" for or against supersymmetry, and in general no significant deviations to date from the results expected of a Standard Model Higgs boson. However some kinds of extensions to the Standard Model would also show very similar results; so commentators noted that based on other particles that are still being understood long after their discovery, it may take years to be sure, and decades to fully understand the particle that has been found.
These findings meant that as of January 2013, scientists were very sure they had found an unknown particle of mass ~ 125¬†GeV/"c"2, and had not been misled by experimental error or a chance result. They were also sure, from initial observations, that the new particle was some kind of boson. The behaviours and properties of the particle, so far as examined since July 2012, also seemed quite close to the behaviours expected of a Higgs boson. Even so, it could still have been a Higgs boson or some other unknown boson, since future tests could show behaviours that do not match a Higgs boson, so as of December 2012 CERN still only stated that the new particle was "consistent with" the Higgs boson, and scientists did not yet positively say it was the Higgs boson. Despite this, in late 2012, widespread media reports announced (incorrectly) that a Higgs boson had been confirmed during the year.
In January 2013, CERN director-general Rolf-Dieter Heuer stated that based on data analysis to date, an answer could be possible 'towards' mid-2013, and the deputy chair of physics at Brookhaven National Laboratory stated in February 2013 that a "definitive" answer might require "another few years" after the collider's 2015 restart. In early March 2013, CERN Research Director Sergio Bertolucci stated that confirming spin-0 was the major remaining requirement to determine whether the particle is at least some kind of Higgs boson.
Confirmation of new particle as a Higgs boson, and current status.
On 14 March 2013 CERN confirmed that:
This also makes the particle the first elementary scalar particle to be discovered in nature.

Public discussion.
Naming.
Names used by physicists.
The name most strongly associated with the particle and field is the Higgs boson and Higgs field. For some time the particle was known by a combination of its PRL author names (including at times Anderson), for example the Brout‚ÄìEnglert‚ÄìHiggs particle, the Anderson-Higgs particle, or the Englert‚ÄìBrout‚ÄìHiggs‚ÄìGuralnik‚ÄìHagen‚ÄìKibble mechanism, and these are still used at times. Fueled in part by the issue of recognition and a potential shared Nobel Prize, the most appropriate name is still occasionally a topic of debate as at 2012. (Higgs himself prefers to call the particle either by an acronym of all those involved, or "the scalar boson", or "the so-called Higgs particle".)
A considerable amount has been written on how Higgs' name came to be exclusively used. Two main explanations are offered.
Nickname.
The Higgs boson is often referred to as the "God particle" in popular media outside the scientific community. The nickname comes from the title of by Nobel Physics prizewinner and Fermilab director Leon Lederman, who wrote it in the context of failing US government support for the Superconducting Super Collider, a part-constructed titanic competitor to the Large Hadron Collider with planned collision energies of that was championed by Lederman since its 1983 inception and shut down in 1993; the book sought in part to promote awareness of the significance and need for such a project in the face of its possible loss of funding.
While media use of this term may have contributed to wider awareness and interest, many scientists feel the name is inappropriate since it is sensational hyperbole and misleads readers; the particle also has nothing to do with God, leaves open numerous questions in fundamental physics, and does not explain the ultimate origin of the universe. Higgs, an atheist, was reported to be displeased and stated in a 2008 interview that he found it "embarrassing" because it was "the kind of misuse... which I think might offend some people". Science writer Ian Sample stated in his 2010 book on the search that the nickname is "universally hate" by physicists and perhaps the "worst derided" in the history of physics, but that (according to Lederman) the publisher rejected all titles mentioning "Higgs" as unimaginative and too unknown.
Lederman begins with a review of the long human search for knowledge, and explains that his tongue-in-cheek title draws an analogy between the impact of the Higgs field on the fundamental symmetries at the Big Bang, and the apparent chaos of structures, particles, forces and interactions that resulted and shaped our present universe, with the biblical story of Babel in which the primordial single language of early Genesis was fragmented into many disparate languages and cultures.
Lederman whimsically asks whether the Higgs boson was added just to perplex and confound those seeking knowledge of the universe, and whether physicists will be confounded by it as recounted in that story, or ultimately surmount the challenge and understand "how beautiful is the universe has made".
Other proposals.
A renaming competition by British newspaper "The Guardian" in 2009 resulted in their science correspondent choosing the name "the champagne bottle boson" as the best submission: "The bottom of a champagne bottle is in the shape of the Higgs potential and is often used as an illustration in physics lectures. So it's not an embarrassingly grandiose name, it is memorable, and has some physics connection too."
The name "Higgson" was suggested as well, in an opinion piece in the Institute of Physics' online publication "physicsworld.com".
Media explanations and analogies.
There has been considerable public discussion of analogies and explanations for the Higgs particle and how the field creates mass, including coverage of explanatory attempts in their own right and a competition in 1993 for the best popular explanation by then-UK Minister for Science Sir William Waldegrave and articles in newspapers worldwide.
An educational collaboration involving an LHC physicist and a High School Teachers at CERN educator suggests that dispersion of light ‚Äì responsible for the rainbow and dispersive prism ‚Äì is a useful analogy for the Higgs field's symmetry breaking and mass-causing effect.
Matt Strassler uses electric fields as an analogy:
A similar explanation was offered by "The Guardian":
The Higgs field's effect on particles was famously described by physicist David Miller as akin to a room full of political party workers spread evenly throughout a room: the crowd gravitates to and slows down famous people but does not slow down others. He also drew attention to well-known effects in solid state physics where an electron's effective mass can be much greater than usual in the presence of a crystal lattice.
Analogies based on drag effects, including analogies of "syrup" or "molasses" are also well known, but can be somewhat misleading since they may be understood (incorrectly) as saying that the Higgs field simply resists some particles' motion but not others' ‚Äì a simple resistive effect could also conflict with Newton's third law.
Recognition and awards.
There has been considerable discussion of how to allocate the credit if the Higgs boson is proven, made more pointed as a Nobel prize had been expected, and the very wide basis of people entitled to consideration. These include a range of theoreticians who made the Higgs mechanism theory possible, the theoreticians of the 1964 PRL papers (including Higgs himself), the theoreticians who derived from these, a working electroweak theory and the Standard Model itself, and also the experimentalists at CERN and other institutions who made possible the proof of the Higgs field and boson in reality. The Nobel prize has a limit of 3 persons to share an award, and some possible winners are already prize holders for other work, or are deceased (the prize is only awarded to persons in their lifetime). Existing prizes for works relating to the Higgs field, boson, or mechanism include:
Additionally Physical Review Letters' 50-year review (2008) recognized the 1964 PRL papers and Weinberg's 1967 paper "A model of Leptons" (the most cited paper in particle physics, as of 2012) "milestone Letters".
Following reported observation of the Higgs-like particle in July 2012, several Indian media outlets reported on the supposed neglect of credit to Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose after whose work in the 1920s the class of particles "bosons" is named (although physicists have described Bose's connection to the discovery as tenuous).
Technical aspects and mathematical formulation.
In the Standard Model, the Higgs field is a four-component scalar field that forms a complex doublet of the weak isospin SU(2) symmetry:
\left(
\phi^1 + i\phi^2 \\ \phi^0+i\phi^3
\right)\;,
while the field has charge +1/2 under the weak hypercharge U(1) symmetry (in the convention where the electric charge, "Q", the weak isospin, "I3", and the weak hypercharge, "Y", are related by "Q = I3 + Y").
The Higgs part of the Lagrangian is
where formula_2 and formula_3 are the gauge bosons of the SU(2) and U(1) symmetries, formula_4 and formula_5 their respective coupling constants, formula_6 (where formula_7 are the Pauli matrices) a complete set generators of the SU(2) symmetry, and formula_8 and formula_9, so that the ground state breaks the SU(2) symmetry (see figure). The ground state of the Higgs field (the bottom of the potential) is degenerate with different ground states related to each other by a SU(2) gauge transformation. It is always possible to pick a gauge such that in the ground state formula_10. The expectation value of formula_11 in the ground state (the vacuum expectation value or vev) is then formula_12, where formula_13. The measured value of this parameter is ~. It has units of mass, and is the only free parameter of the Standard Model that is not a dimensionless number. Quadratic terms in formula_14 and formula_15 arise, which give masses to the "W" and "Z" bosons:
with their ratio determining the Weinberg angle, formula_16, and leave a massless U(1) photon, formula_17.
The quarks and the leptons interact with the Higgs field through Yukawa interaction terms:
+\lambda_u^{ij}\frac{\phi^1-i\phi^2}{\sqrt{2}}\overline d_L^i u_R^j\\
&-\lambda_d^{ij}\frac{\phi^0+i\phi^3}{\sqrt{2}}\overline d_L^i d_R^j
-\lambda_d^{ij}\frac{\phi^1+i\phi^2}{\sqrt{2}}\overline u_L^i d_R^j\\
&-\lambda_e^{ij}\frac{\phi^0+i\phi^3}{\sqrt{2}}\overline e_L^i e_R^j
-\lambda_e^{ij}\frac{\phi^1+i\phi^2}{\sqrt{2}}\overline \nu_L^i e_R^j
where formula_18 are left-handed and right-handed quarks and leptons of the "i"th generation, formula_19are matrices of Yukawa couplings where h.c. denotes the hermitian conjugate terms. In the symmetry breaking ground state, only the terms containing formula_11 remain, giving rise to mass terms for the fermions. Rotating the quark and lepton fields to the basis where the matrices of Yukawa couplings are diagonal, one gets
where the masses of the fermions are formula_21, and formula_22 denote the eigenvalues of the Yukawa matrices.

Boson

In quantum mechanics, bosons (, ) comprise one of two classes of particles, the other being fermions. The name boson was coined by Paul Dirac to commemorate the contribution of the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose in developing, with Einstein, Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics‚Äîwhich theorizes the characteristics of elementary particles. Examples of bosons include fundamental particles (e.g., the Higgs boson, the four force-carrying gauge bosons of the Standard Model, and the still-theoretical graviton of quantum gravity); composite particles (e.g., mesons and stable nuclei of even mass number such as deuterium, helium-4, or lead-208); and some of quasiparticles (e.g. Cooper pairs, plasmons, and phonons).
An important characteristic of bosons is that their statistics does not restrict the number that can occupy the same quantum state. This property is exemplified in helium-4 when it is cooled to become a superfluid. In contrast, two fermions cannot occupy the same quantum space. Whereas the elementary particles that make up matter (i.e. leptons and quarks) are fermions, the elementary bosons are force carriers that function as the 'glue' holding matter together. This property holds for all particles with integer spin (s = 0, 1, 2 etc.) as an immediate consequence of the spin‚Äìstatistics theorem.
Properties.
Bosons contrast with fermions, which obey Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics. Two or more fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state (see Pauli exclusion principle).
Since bosons with the same energy can occupy the same place in space, bosons are often force carrier particles. In contrast, fermions are usually associated with matter (although in quantum physics the distinction between the two concepts is not clear cut).
Bosons may be either elementary, like photons, or composite, like mesons.
While most bosons are composite particles, in the Standard Model, there are five bosons which are elementary:
Additionally, the graviton¬†(G), a hypothetical elementary particle not incorporated in the Standard Model, if it exists, must be a boson, and could conceivably be a gauge boson.
Composite bosons are important in superfluidity and other applications of Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates.
Definition and basic properties.
By definition, bosons are particles which obey Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics: when one swaps two bosons (of the same species), the wavefunction of the system is unchanged. Fermions, on the other hand, obey Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics and the Pauli exclusion principle: two fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state, resulting in a "rigidity" or "stiffness" of matter which includes fermions. Thus fermions are sometimes said to be the constituents of matter, while bosons are said to be the particles that transmit interactions (force carriers), or the constituents of radiation. The quantum fields of bosons are bosonic fields, obeying canonical commutation relations.
The properties of lasers and masers, superfluid helium-4 and Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates are all consequences of statistics of bosons. Another result is that the spectrum of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium is a Planck spectrum, one example of which is black-body radiation; another is the thermal radiation of the opaque early Universe seen today as microwave background radiation. 
Interactions between elementary particles are called fundamental interactions. The fundamental interactions of virtual bosons with real particles result in all forces we know.
All known elementary and composite particles are bosons or fermions, depending on their spin: particles with half-integer spin are fermions; particles with integer spin are bosons. In the framework of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, this is a purely empirical observation. However, in relativistic quantum field theory, the spin‚Äìstatistics theorem shows that half-integer spin particles cannot be bosons and integer spin particles cannot be fermions.
In large systems, the difference between bosonic and fermionic statistics is only apparent at large densities‚Äîwhen their wave functions overlap. At low densities, both types of statistics are well approximated by Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics, which is described by classical mechanics.
Elementary bosons.
All observed elementary particles are either fermions or bosons. The observed elementary bosons are all gauge bosons: photons, W and Z bosons and gluons.
In addition, the standard model postulates the existence of Higgs bosons, which give other particles their mass via the Higgs mechanism. As of July 2012, most physicists at the CERN Large Hadron Collider believe they may have observed these particles, although further tests are needed to confirm this discovery. Since the Higgs field is a scalar field, the Higgs boson has no spin. The Higgs boson is also its own antiparticle and is CP-even, and has no electric charge and no color charge.
Finally, many approaches to quantum gravity postulate a force carrier for gravity, the graviton, which is a boson of spin plus or minus two.
Composite bosons.
Composite particles (such as hadrons, nuclei, and atoms) can be bosons or fermions depending on their constituents. More precisely, because of the relation between spin and statistics, a particle containing an even number of fermions is a boson, since it has integer spin.
Examples include the following:
The number of bosons within a composite particle made up of simple particles bound with a potential has no effect on whether it is a boson or a fermion.
To which states can bosons crowd?
Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics encourages identical bosons to crowd into one quantum state, but not any state is necessarily convenient for it. Aside of statistics, bosons can interact¬†‚Äì for example, helium-4 atoms are repulsed by intermolecular force on a very close approach, and if one hypothesize their condensation in a spatially-localized state, then gains from the statistics cannot overcome a prohibitive force potential. A spatially-delocalized state (i.e. with low ) is preferable: if the number density of the condensate is about the same as in ordinary liquid or solid state, then the repulsive potential for the "N"-particle condensate in such state can be not higher than for a liquid or a crystalline lattice of the same "N" particles described without quantum statistics. Thus, Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics for a material particle is not a mechanism to bypass physical restrictions on the density of the corresponding substance, and superfluid liquid helium has the density comparable to the density of ordinary liquid matter. Spatially-delocalized states also permit for a low momentum according to uncertainty principle, hence for low kinetic energy; that's why superfluidity and superconductivity are usually observed in low temperatures.
Photons do not interact with themselves and hence do not experience this difference in states where to crowd (see squeezed coherent state).

Larra bicolor

Larra bicolor is a parasitoid wasp native to South America. It was introduced into Florida as a biological pest control of invasive mole crickets.
Description.
Adult females of this species are about 22¬†mm long, with the males somewhat smaller. The head and thorax are black, with silver markings on the head; the abdomen is red. The wings are variable in color, of a dusky hue.
Life cycle.
These wasps feed on nectar as adults, with the shrubby false buttonweed ("Spermacoce verticillata") preferred. Females hunt mole crickets in the genus "Scapteriscus", stinging them on the underside to paralyze them for several minutes. A single egg is deposited between the first and second pairs of legs. The wasp then flies off, and the cricket returns to its burrow. Nymphs as well as adult crickets are attacked, as long as they are large enough.
Upon hatching, the larva feeds upon its host, eventually killing it. It pupates within 12 to 30 days (depending on temperature), forming a cocoon in the remains of the cricket by gluing sand grains together. The pupal phase may be as short as 50 days, but the pupa may enter diapause in the winter, delaying emergence for months. Adults are solitary and do not form nests or colonies.
Other than the winter diapause mentioned above, there is no seasonal component to wasp activity. Several generations of wasps may occur in a year, one of the facets that allows these wasps to out-reproduce their hosts, an important attribute for a successful biological control agent.
Biological pest control use.
Non-native mole crickets arrived in Puerto Rico, at least as early as the 18th century, probably by flight, and as early as 1899 in the southeastern United States, probably as contaminants of ship ballast. They became serious pests, damaging crops and pasture- and turfgrasses. Although the related "L. analis" attacks the native northern mole cricket, it does not attack non-native species. In an early example of biological pest control, "L. bicolor" was introduced into Puerto Rico in 1938, where it became successfully established. This suggested the possibility of its use on the mainland; however, failed attempts and the development of chlordane pesticide in the 1940s brought an end to these efforts.
When chlordane use on food crops was banned in 1978, the Florida legislature inaugurated a program at the University of Florida to find alternative controls for pest mole crickets. Budgetary limitations led to a repetition of the Puerto Rico to the mainland effort. But this population, which originated in Brazil, failed to establish itself except in an area around Fort Lauderdale. Research suggested that these wasps were insufficiently cold-tolerant, and a second effort in 1988-89 used wasps from Bolivia. This introduction was much more successful, and the wasps have gradually spread through most of the state and into neighboring states. They remain highly adapted to the non-native species and have not diversified to attack (for instance) the native northern mole cricket. Also, they are non-aggressive, and their sting is reported to be mild compared to more familiar wasps. The principal limitation in its use as a biological control agent has been the need to find appropriate nectar sources for the adults. Research has found that some other plants, especially "pentas", are also found acceptable; nonetheless provision of suitable plants is necessary.

Tor (anonymity network)

Tor (previously an acronym for The Onion Router) is free software for enabling online anonymity and censorship resistance. Tor directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer network consisting of more than five thousand relays to conceal a user's location or usage from anyone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis. Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity, including "visits to Web sites, online posts, instant messages, and other communication forms", back to the user and is intended to protect the personal privacy of users, as well as their freedom and ability to conduct confidential business by keeping their internet activities from being monitored. An extract of a Top Secret appraisal by the NSA characterized Tor as "the King of high secure, low latency Internet anonymity" with "no contenders for the throne in waiting".
The term "onion routing" refers to layers of encryption, nested like the layers of an onion, used to anonymize communication. Tor encrypts the original data, including the destination IP address, multiple times and sends it through a virtual circuit comprising successive, randomly selected Tor relays. Each relay decrypts a layer of encryption to reveal only the next relay in the circuit in order to pass the remaining encrypted data on to it. The final relay decrypts the innermost layer of encryption and sends the original data to its destination without revealing, or even knowing, the source IP address. Since the routing of the communication is partly concealed at every hop in the Tor circuit, this method eliminates any single point at which the communication can be de-anonymized through network surveillance that relies upon knowing its source and destination.
An adversary unable to defeat the strong anonymity that Tor provides may try to de-anonymize the communication by other means, for instance by exploiting vulnerable software on the user's computer. One technique developed by the NSA that targets outdated Firefox web browsers is codenamed EgotisticalGiraffe.
History.
An alpha version of the free software, with the onion routing network "functional and deployed", was announced on 20 September 2002. Roger Dingledine, Nick Mathewson, and Paul Syverson presented "Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router" at the thirteenth USENIX Security Symposium on 13 August 2004. Although the name Tor originated as an acronym of The Onion Routing project (TOR project), the current project no longer considers the name to be an acronym, and therefore, does not use all capital letters.
Originally sponsored by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, which had been instrumental in the early development of onion routing under the aegis of DARPA, Tor was financially supported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation from 2004 to 2005. Tor software is now developed by the Tor Project, which has been a 501(c)(3) research-education nonprofit organization based in the United States of America since December 2006. It has a diverse base of financial support; the U.S. State Department, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and the National Science Foundation are major contributors. As of 2012, 80% of the Tor Project's $2M annual budget comes from the United States government, with the Swedish government and other organizations providing the rest, including NGOs and thousands of individual sponsors. One of the founders of the project, Roger Dingledine, stated that the DoD funds are less similar to being a procurement contract and are more simiar to a research grant. Andrew Lewman, the executive director of the Tor project, stated that even though it accepts funds from the U.S. federal government, the Tor service did not necessarily collaborate with the NSA to reveal identities of users.
On December 17, 2013, the Tor Project announced that it would begin accepting bitcoin, thus becoming, to its knowledge, the first 501(c)(3) non-profit organization to test the compatibility of bitcoins with the U.S. government's A-133 Audit Standard.
In March 2011, the Tor Project was awarded the Free Software Foundation's 2010 Award for Projects of Social Benefit on the following grounds: "Using free software, Tor has enabled roughly 36 million people around the world to experience freedom of access and expression on the Internet while keeping them in control of their privacy and anonymity. Its network has proved pivotal in dissident movements in both Iran and more recently Egypt."
"Foreign Policy" named Dingledine, Mathewson, and Syverson among its 2012 Top 100 Global Thinkers "for making the web safe for whistleblowers."
In 2013, Jacob Appelbaum described Tor as a "part of an ecosystem of software that helps people regain and reclaim their autonomy. It helps to enable people to have agency of all kinds; it helps others to help each other and it helps you to help yourself. It runs, it is open and it is supported by a large community spread across all walks of life."
Edward Snowden used the Tor Network to send information about PRISM to the "Washington Post" and "The Guardian" in June 2013.
Operation.
Tor aims to conceal its users' identities and their online activity from surveillance and traffic analysis by separating identification and routing. It is an implementation of onion routing, which encrypts and then randomly bounces communications through a network of relays run by volunteers around the globe. These onion routers employ encryption in a multi-layered manner (hence the onion metaphor) to ensure perfect forward secrecy between relays, thereby providing users with anonymity in network location. That anonymity extends to the hosting of censorship-resistant content via Tor's anonymous hidden service feature. Furthermore, by keeping some of the entry relays (bridge relays) secret, users can evade Internet censorship that relies upon blocking public Tor relays.
Because the internet address of the sender and the recipient are not "both" in cleartext at any hop along the way, anyone eavesdropping at any point along the communication channel cannot directly identify both ends. Furthermore, to the recipient it appears that the last Tor node (the exit node) is the originator of the communication rather than the sender.
Originating traffic.
A Tor user's SOCKS-aware applications can be configured to direct their network traffic through a Tor instance's SOCKS interface. Tor periodically creates virtual circuits through the Tor network through which it can multiplex and onion route that traffic to its destination. Once inside a Tor network, the traffic is sent from router to router along the circuit, ultimately reaching an exit node at which point the cleartext packet is available and is forwarded on to its original destination. Viewed from the destination, the traffic appears to originate at the Tor exit node.
Tor's application independence sets it apart from most other anonymity networks: it works at the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) stream level. Applications whose traffic is commonly anonymised using Tor include Internet Relay Chat (IRC), instant messaging, and World Wide Web browsing.
Hidden services.
Tor can also provide anonymity to websites and other servers. Servers configured to receive inbound connections only through Tor are called hidden services. Rather than revealing a server's IP address (and thus its network location), a hidden service is accessed through its onion address. The Tor network understands these addresses and can route data to and from hidden services, even to those hosted behind firewalls or network address translators (NAT), while preserving the anonymity of both parties. Tor is necessary to access hidden services.
Hidden services have been deployed on the Tor network since 2004. Other than the database that stores the hidden-service descriptors, Tor is decentralized by design; there is no direct readable list of all hidden services, although a number of hidden services catalog publicly known onion addresses.
Because hidden services do not use exit nodes, connection to a hidden service is encrypted end-to-end and not subject to eavesdropping. There are, however, security issues involving Tor hidden services. For example, services that are reachable through Tor hidden services "and" the public Internet, are susceptible to correlation attacks and thus not perfectly hidden. Other pitfalls include misconfigured services (e.g. identifying information included by default in web server error responses), uptime and downtime statistics, intersection attacks, and user error.
Weaknesses.
Like all current low latency anonymity networks, Tor cannot and does not attempt to protect against monitoring of traffic at the boundaries of the Tor network, i.e., the traffic entering and exiting the network. While Tor does provide protection against traffic analysis, it cannot prevent traffic confirmation (also called "end-to-end correlation").
In spite of known weaknesses and attacks listed here, Tor and the alternative network system JonDonym (Java Anon Proxy, JAP) are considered more resilient than alternatives such as VPNs. Were a local observer on an ISP or WLAN to attempt to analyze the size and timing of the encrypted data stream going through the VPN, Tor, or JonDo system, the latter two would be harder to analyze, as demonstrated by a 2009 study.
Researchers from the University of Michigan developed a network scanner allowing identification of 86 percent of live Tor ‚Äúbridges‚Äù with a single scan.
Eavesdropping Autonomous System (AS).
If an Autonomous System (AS) exists on both path segments from a client to entry relay and from exit relay to destination, such an AS can statistically correlate trafÔ¨Åc on the entry and exit segments of the path and potentially infer the destination with which the client communicated. In 2012, LASTor proposed a method to predict set of potential ASes on these two segments and then avoid choosing this path during path selection algorithm on client side. In this paper, they also improve latency by choosing shorter geographical paths between client and destination.
Bad Apple attack.
Steven J. Murdoch and George Danezis from University of Cambridge presented an article at the 2005 IEEE Symposium on security and privacy on traffic-analysis techniques that allow adversaries with only a partial view of the network to infer which nodes are being used to relay the anonymous streams. These techniques greatly reduce the anonymity provided by Tor. Murdoch and Danezis have also shown that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator. This attack, however, fails to reveal the identity of the original user. Murdoch has been working with‚Äîand has been funded by‚ÄîTor since 2006.
In March 2011, researchers with the Rocquencourt, France based National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control (Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique, INRIA) documented an attack that is capable of revealing the IP addresses of BitTorrent users on the Tor network. The "bad apple attack" exploits Tor's design and takes advantage of insecure application use to associate the simultaneous use of a secure application with the IP address of the Tor user in question. One method of attack depends on control of an exit node or hijacking tracker responses, while a secondary attack method is based in part on the statistical exploitation of distributed hash table tracking. According to the study:
The results presented in the bad apple attack research paper are based on an attack in the wild launched against the Tor network by the authors of the study. The attack targeted six exit nodes, lasted for 23 days, and revealed a total of 10,000 IP addresses of active Tor users. This study is particularly significant because it is the first documented attack designed to target P2P file sharing applications on Tor. BitTorrent may generate as much as 40% of all traffic on Tor. Furthermore, the bad apple attack is effective against insecure use of any application over Tor, not just BitTorrent.
Exit node eavesdropping.
In September 2007, Dan Egerstad, a Swedish security consultant, revealed that he had intercepted usernames and passwords for a large number of e-mail accounts by operating and monitoring Tor exit nodes. As Tor does not, and by design cannot, encrypt the traffic between an exit node and the target server, any exit node is in a position to capture any traffic passing through it that does not use end-to-end encryption such as TLS. While this may not inherently breach the anonymity of the source, traffic intercepted in this way by self-selected third parties can expose information about the source in either or both of payload and protocol data. Furthermore, Egerstad is circumspect about the possible subversion of Tor by intelligence agencies ‚Äì
In October 2011, a research team from ESIEA claimed to have discovered a way to compromise the Tor network by decrypting communication passing over it. The technique they describe requires creating a map of Tor network nodes, controlling one third of them, and then acquiring their encryption keys and algorithm seeds. Then, using these known keys and seeds, they claim the ability to decrypt two encryption layers out of three. They claim to break the third key by a statistical-based attack. In order to redirect Tor traffic to the nodes they controlled, they used a denial-of-service attack. A response to this claim has been published on the official Tor Blog stating that these rumours of Tor's compromise are greatly exaggerated.
Some protocols leak IP addresses.
Researchers from French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control (INRIA) showed that Tor dissimulation technique in BitTorrent can be bypassed.
Site operators may block traffic from Tor exit nodes.
Operators of Internet sites have the ability to prevent connections from Tor exit nodes, or to offer reduced functionality to Tor users. For example, it is not generally possible to edit Wikipedia when using Tor, or when using an IP address that also is used by a Tor exit node, due to the use of the MediaWiki extension, unless an is obtained.
Firefox / JavaScript anonymity attack on Freedom Hosting users.
In August 2013, it was discovered that the Firefox browsers in many older versions of the Tor Browser Bundle were vulnerable to a JavaScript attack, which was being exploited to send users' IP addresses and Windows computer names to the attackers. News reports linked this to an FBI operation targeting Freedom Hosting's owner, Eric Eoin Marques. He was arrested on a provisional extradition warrant issued by a U.S. court on 29 July. The FBI is seeking to extradite Marques to Maryland on four charges: distributing, conspiring to distribute, and advertising child pornography ‚Äì as well as aiding and abetting advertising of child pornography. The warrant alleges that Marques is ‚Äúthe largest facilitator of child porn on the planet.‚Äù The FBI acknowledged the attack in a 12 September 2013 court filing in Dublin; further technical details from a training presentation leaked by Edward Snowden showed that the codename for the exploit was "EgotisticalGiraffe".
Controversy over illegal activities.
Tor has been described by "The Economist", in relation to Bitcoin and the Silk Road, as being "a dark corner of the web." It has been targeted by both the American NSA and the British GCHQ signals intelligence agencies, albeit with marginal success. At times, anonymizing systems such as Tor are used for matters that are, or may be, illegal in some countries, e.g., Tor may be used to gain access to censored information, to organize political activities, or to circumvent laws against criticism of heads of state. Tor can also be used for anonymous defamation, unauthorized leaks of sensitive information and copyright infringement, the distribution of illegal sexual content (and has indeed been explicitly required by one such criminal enterprise), the selling of controlled substances, money laundering, credit card fraud, and identity theft; furthermore, the black market which utilizes the Tor infrastructure operates, at least in part, in conjunction with Bitcoin. Ironically, Tor has been used by criminal enterprises, hacktivism groups, and law enforcement agencies at cross purposes, sometimes simultaneously; likewise, agencies within the U.S. government variously fund Tor (the U.S. State Department), the National Science Foundation, and (via the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which itself partially funded Tor until October 2012), Radio Free Asia, and seek to subvert it.
Many organizations argue or acknowledge that Tor has legal, legitimate uses. In its complaint against Ross William Ulbricht of the Silk Road the FBI acknowledged that Tor has "known legitimate uses". EFF's Surveillance Self-Defense guide includes a description of where Tor fits in a larger strategy for protecting privacy and anonymity. The Tor Project's FAQ offers supporting reasons for EFF's endorsement:
Criminals can already do bad things. Since they're willing to break laws, they already have lots of options available that provide better privacy than Tor provides...
Tor aims to provide protection for ordinary people who want to follow the law. Only criminals have privacy right now, and we need to fix that...
So yes, criminals could in theory use Tor, but they already have better options, and it seems unlikely that taking Tor away from the world will stop them from doing their bad things. At the same time, Tor and other privacy measures can fight identity theft, physical crimes like stalking, and so on.
Implementations.
The main implementation of Tor is written in the C programming language and consists of roughly 146,000 lines of source code.

Thomas J. Barry

Thomas J. "Tom" Barry (July 27, 1907 ‚Äì March, 1987) was a trainer of Thoroughbred racehorse who won two American Classic Races with foreign-bred horses. Born in Ireland, as a young man he emigrated to the United States where he became a citizen around 1930. 
In 1951 Tom Barry won the training title at Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport, New Jersey which marked the beginning of a decade in which he enjoyed considerable racing success. In 1952, Barry began the race conditioning of a colt named Errard King for owner Joseph Gavegnano. Under regular jockey Sam Boulmetis, Sr., in 1953 the two-year-old Errard King won the Tyro Stakes and the Laurel Futurity Stakes and the following year captured two very important races, the American Derby and Arlington Classic.
American Classic Races.
In his only appearance in the Kentucky Derby, in 1956 Tom Barry trained High King to a tenth-place finish. He had two horses run in the Preakness Stakes: Celtic Ash finished third in 1960, and Vimy Ridge earned fourth place in 1962. However, from two entries in the third leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series, the Belmont Stakes, Tom Barry's horses won both. For owner Joseph O'Connell, a banker from Boston, Massachusetts, Barry used his knowledge of the Irish Thoroughbred industry and had O'Connell buy Cavan in the belief that the Irish-born colt was genetically suited to run its best at longer distances. Barry proved correct as the colt won the 1958 Belmont Stakes, at a mile and a half, the longest of the U.S. Triple Crown races. In winning, Cavan spoiled Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner Tim Tam's bid to capture the Triple Crown. Two years later in 1960, Tom Barry and Joseph O'Connell's Green Dunes Farm did the same thing when they purchased the British-bred colt Celtic Ash in Ireland. Bought for $22,000, in the United States Celtic Ash earned more than $130,000. In the 1 3/16 mile Preakness Stakes of 1960, Celtic Ash finished third but then won the much longer Belmont Stakes.
Tom Barry owned Ardmore Farm in Darlington, Maryland where he was living at the time of his death in 1987. The property was purchased from his Estate by Audrey and Allen Murray who renamed it Murmur Farm.[http://www.murmurfarm.com]

English Canadian

An English Canadian or Anglo-Canadian refers to either a Canadian of English ethnic origin and heritage, or to an English-speaking, or Anglophone, Canadian of any ethnic origin; it is used primarily in contrast with French Canadian. Canada is an officially bilingual state, with English and French official language communities. Immigrant cultural groups ostensibly integrate into one or both of these communities, but often retaining elements of their original cultures. The term English-speaking Canadian is sometimes used interchangeably with English Canadian.
Although many English-speaking Canadians have strong historical roots traceable to England or other parts of the British Isles, the population as whole belongs to a multitude of ethnic backgrounds. They or their ancestors came from various European, Asian, Caribbean, African, Latin American, and Pacific Island cultures, as well as French Canada and North American Aboriginal groups. As such, although the office of the Governor General is said to alternate between "French" and "English" persons, the two most recent former Governors General (Adrienne Clarkson, an English-speaking Chinese Canadian; and Micha√´lle Jean, a French-speaking Haitian Canadian) show that this refers to language and not culture or ethnicity.
In addition to the terms "English Canadian" and "Canadian", the terms "Anglophone Canadian" and "Anglo-Canadian" are also used.
Geographic distribution.
The following table shows the English-speaking population of Canada's provinces and territories. The data are from Statistics Canada.
Figures are given for the number of single responses "English" to the mother tongue question, as well as a total including multiple responses one of which is English.
Notably, 46% of English-speaking Canadians live in Ontario, and 30% in the two western provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. English-speakers are in the minority only in Quebec and Nunavut. In the cases of Quebec and New Brunswick, the vast majority of the non-Anglophone population speaks French, in the case of Nunavut, the people speak a non-official language of Canada, Inuktitut.
History.
Newfoundland (and Labrador).
English Canadian history starts with the attempts to establish English settlements in Newfoundland in the seventeenth century. The earliest of these was John Guy's failed settlement at Cuper's Cove on the Avalon Peninsula in 1610. Newfoundland's population was significantly influenced by Irish immigration, much of it as a result of the migratory fishery in the decades prior to the Irish Potato famine. Although the location of the earliest English settlement in what would eventually become Canada, Newfoundland itself (now called Newfoundland and Labrador) would be the last province to enter Confederation in 1949.
Nova Scotia.
The area that forms the present day province of Nova Scotia was contested by the British and French in the eighteenth century. French settlements at Port Royal, Louisbourg and what is now Prince Edward Island were seized by the British (or by American Colonists, as in the case of Louisbourg). After the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht ceded the French colony of Acadia (today's mainland Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) to Great Britain, efforts to colonize the province were limited to small settlements in Canso and Annapolis Royal. In 1749 Colonel Edward Cornwallis was given command of an expedition for the settlement of Chebucto by some three thousand persons, many of whom were Cockney. Cornwallis' settlement, Halifax, would become the provincial capital, the primary commercial centre for the Maritime provinces, a strategic British military and naval outpost and an important east coast cultural centre. To offset the Catholic presence of Acadians, foreign Protestants (mainly German) were given land and founded Lunenburg. Nova Scotia itself saw considerable immigration from Scotland, particularly to communities such as Pictou in the northern part of the province and to Cape Breton Island, but this began only with the arrival of the Hector in 1773.
Loyalists: New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario.
The history of English Canadians is bound to the history of English settlement of North America, and particularly New England, because of the resettlement of many Loyalists following the American Revolution in areas that would form part of Canada. Many of the fifty thousand Loyalists who were resettled to the north of the United States after 1783 came from families that had already been settled for several generations in North America and were from prominent families in Boston, New York and other east coast towns. Although largely of British ancestry, these settlers had also intermarried with Huguenot and Dutch colonists and were accompanied by Loyalists of African descent. Dispossessed of their property at the end of the Revolutionary War, the Loyalists arrived as refugees to settle primarily along the shores of southern Nova Scotia, the Bay of Fundy and the Saint John River and in Quebec to the east and southwest of Montreal.
The colony of New Brunswick was created from western part of Nova Scotia at the instigation of these new English-speaking settlers. The Loyalist settlements in southwestern Quebec formed the nucleus of what would become the province of Upper Canada and, after 1867, Ontario.
Ontario.
Upper Canada was a primary destination for English, Scottish and Scots-Irish settlers to Canada in the nineteenth century, and was on the front lines in the War of 1812 between the British Empire and the United States. The province also received immigrants from non English-speaking sources such as Germans, many of whom settled around Kitchener (formerly called Berlin). Ontario would become the most populous province in the Dominion of Canada at the time of Confederation, and, together with Montreal, formed the country's industrial heartland and emerged as an important cultural and media centre for English Canada. Toronto is today the largest city in Canada, and, largely as a result of changing immigration patterns since the 1960s, is also one of the most multi-cultural cities in the world.
Quebec.
After the fall of New France to the British in 1759, a colonial governing class established itself in Quebec City. Larger numbers of English-speaking settlers arrived in the Eastern Townships and Montreal after the American Revolution. English, Scottish, and Irish communities established themselves in Montreal in the 1800s. Montreal would become Canada's largest city and commercial hub in Canada. An Anglo-Scot business elite would control Canadian commerce up until the 1950s, founding a Protestant public school system and hospitals and universities such as McGill University. These immigrants were joined by other Europeans in the early 1900s, including Italians and Jews, who assimilated to a large degree into the anglophone community. Many English-speaking Quebeckers left Quebec following the election of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois in 1976 resulting in a steep decline in the anglophone population; many who have remained have learned French in order to function within the dominant Francophone society.
British Columbia.
As in much of western Canada, many of the earliest European communities in British Columbia began as outposts of the Hudson's Bay Company, founded in London in 1670 to carry on the fur trade via Hudson Bay. Broader settlement began in earnest with the founding of Fort Victoria in 1843 and the subsequent creation of the Colony of Vancouver Island in 1849. The capital, Victoria developed during the height of the British Empire and long self-identified as being "more English than the English".
The Colony of British Columbia was established on the mainland in 1858 by Governor James Douglas as a means of asserting British sovereignty in the face of a massive influx of gold miners, many of whom were American. Despite the enormous distances that separated the Pacific colony from Central Canada, British Columbia joined Confederation in 1871, choosing to become Canadian partly as a means of resisting possible absorption into the United States. Chinese workers, brought in to labour on the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, established sizeable populations in many B.C. communities, particularly Vancouver which quickly became the province's economic and cultural centre after the railway's completion in 1886. Like Ontario, British Columbia has received immigrants from a broad range of countries including large numbers of Germans, Scandinavians, Italians, Sikhs from India and Chinese from Hong Kong, Taiwan and in more recent years, the People's Republic, and the ongoing influx of Europeans from Europe continues. However for many years British Columbia, in contrast to the Prairie Provinces, received a majority of immigrants from Great Britain: over half in 1911 and over 60 percent by 1921. Over half of people with British ancestry in British Columbia have direct family ties within two generations (i.e. grandparent or parent) to the British Isles, rather than via British ethnic stock from Central Canada or the Maritimes (unlike the Prairies where Canadian-British stock is more common). Europeans of non-British stock have been more common, also, in British Columbia than in any other part of Canada, although certain ethnicities such as Ukrainians and Scandinavians are more concentrated in the Prairies. Except for the Italians and more recent European immigrants, earlier waves of Europeans of all origins are near-entirely assimilated, although any number of accents are common in families and communities nearly anywhere in the province, as has also been the case since colonial times. Interethnic and interracial marriages and were also more common in British Columbia than in other provinces since colonial times .
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.
The French-English tensions that marked the establishment of the earliest English-speaking settlements in Nova Scotia were echoed on the Prairies in the late nineteenth century. The earliest British settlement in Assiniboia (part of present-day Manitoba) involved some 300 largely Scottish colonists under the sponsorship of Lord Selkirk in 1811. The early attempts at introducing English-speaking settlers into an area already occupied by French-speaking M√©tis sparked the Red River Rebellion and the later Northwest Rebellion. These conflicts created a rift between Ontario, (English-speaking and at the time largely Protestant), and Quebec. The suppression of the rebellions allowed the government of Canada to proceed with a settlement of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta that was to create provinces that identified generally with English Canada in culture and outlook, although immigration included large numbers of people from non English-speaking European backgrounds, especially Scandinavians and Ukrainians.
Twentieth century.
Although Canada has long prided itself on its relatively peaceful history, war has played a significant role in the formation of an English Canadian identity. As part of the British Empire, Canada found itself at war against the Central Powers in 1914. In the main, English Canadians enlisted for service with an initial enthusiastic and genuine sense of loyalty and duty. In World War II, Canada made its own separate declaration of war and played a critical role in supporting the Allied war effort. Again, support for the war effort to defend the United Kingdom and liberate continental Europe from Axis domination was particularly strong among English Canadians. In the post war era, although Canada was committed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, English Canadians took considerable pride in the Nobel Prize for Peace awarded to Lester Pearson for his role in resolving the Suez Crisis and have been determined supporters of the peacekeeping activities of the United Nations.
In the late twentieth century, increasing American cultural influence combined with diminishing British influence, and political and constitutional crises driven by the exigencies of dealing with the Quebec sovereignty movement and Western alienation contributed to something of an identity crisis for English Canadians. George Grant's "Lament for a Nation" is still seen as an important work relating to the stresses and vulnerabilities affecting English Canada. However, the period of the 1960s through to the present have also seen tremendous accomplishments in English Canadian literature. Writers from English-speaking Canada such as Margaret Atwood, Mordecai Richler, Margaret Laurence, Robertson Davies, Timothy Findley, and Carol Shields dissected the experience of English Canadians and assumed a place among the world's best-known English-language literary figures. Journalist Pierre Berton wrote a number of books popularizing Canadian history which had a particular resonance among English-speaking Canadians, while critics and philosophers such as Northrop Frye and John Ralston Saul have attempted to analyze the Canadian experience. Still, particularly at the academic level, debate continues as to the nature of English Canada and the extent to which English Canadians exist as an identifiable identity.
Symbols.
The maple leaf itself, as a symbol, was used as early as 1834 in what is now Quebec as a symbol of the "Soci√©t√© St. Jean Baptiste" but was adopted for use shortly afterwards by the English-speaking community in Canada. The "Maple Leaf Forever", penned in 1867 at the time of Confederation was at one time regarded as an informal anthem for English Canadians,
The beaver is sometimes seen as another Canadian symbol, but is not necessarily specific to English Canadians. It too was used originally in connection with the "Soci√©t√© St. Jean Baptiste" before coming into currency as a more general Canadian symbol. In the 1973 political satire by Stanley Burke, "Frog Fables & Beaver Tales", a spoof on Canadian politics of the Pierre Trudeau era, English Canadians are depicted in the main as well-meaning, but not terribly clever beavers (with other animals such as frogs, sea otters and gophers assigned to represent other linguistic and provincial populations). The historical relevance of the beaver stems from the early fur trade. It has been asserted that "he fur trade in general and the Hudson's Bay Company in particular exercised a profound influence on the sculpting of the Canadian soul."
The Crown has historically been an intangible but significant symbol for many English Canadians. Loyalty to Great Britain created the initial fracture lines between the populations of the Thirteen Colonies and the populations of Nova Scotia and Quebec at the time of the American Revolution and forced the flight of the Loyalists after the end of the war. As such English Canada developed in the nineteenth century along lines that continued to emphasize this historical attachment, evident in the naming of cities, parks and even whole provinces after members of the royal family, the retention of flags, badges and provincial mottos expressive of loyalty, and enthusiastic responses to royal visits. While such loyalty is no longer as powerful a unifying force as it once was among English Canadians, it continues to exert a noticeable influence on English Canadian culture. According to the author and political commentator Richard Gwyn while "he British connection has long vanished... it takes only a short dig down to the sedimentary layer once occupied by the Loyalists to locate the sources of a great many contemporary Canadian convictions and conventions." Gwyn considers that the modern equivalent of the once talismanic loyalty is "tolerance": "a quality now accepted almost universally as the feature that makes us a distinct people."
Ethnic composition.
The 2001 Census of Canada provides information about the ethnic composition of English-speaking Canadians. This "refers to the ethnic or cultural group(s) to which the respondent's ancestors belong". However, interpretation of data is complicated by two factors.
See the definition of "ethnic origin" from the 2001 Census dictionary for further information.
The data in the following tables pertain to the population of Canada reporting English as its sole mother tongue, a total of 17,352,315 inhabitants out of 29,639,035. A figure for single ethnic origin responses is provide, as well as a total figure for ethnic origins appearing in single or multiple responses (for groups exceeding 2% of the total English-speaking population). The sum of the percentages for single responses is less than 100%, while the corresponding total for single or multiple responses is greater than 100%. The data are taken from the 2001 Census of Canada.
The remaining ethnic groups (single or multiple responses) forming at least 1% of the English-speaking population are Welsh (2.0%), Swedish (1.5%), Hungarian (1.5%), East Indian (1.4%), M√©tis (1.4%), Jewish (1.4%), Russian (1.4%), American (1.3%), Jamaican (1.2%) and Chinese (1.1%). The remaining ethnic groups (single response) forming at least 0.5% of the English-speaking population are East Indian (1.0%), Jamaican (0.8%) and Chinese (0.6%).
Depending on the principal period of immigration to Canada and other factors, ethnic groups (other than British Isles, French, and Aboriginal ones) vary in their percentage of native speakers of English. For example, while a roughly equal number of Canadians have at least partial Ukrainian and Chinese ancestry, 82% of Ukrainian Canadians speak English as their sole mother tongue, and only 17% of Chinese Canadians do (though this rises to 34% in the 0 to 14 age group). As the number of second and third-generation Chinese Canadians increases, their weight within the English-speaking population can also be expected to increase. It should also be borne in mind that some percentage of any minority ethnic group will adopt French, particularly in Quebec.
Culture.
Language.
In the 2001 Canadian census, 17,572,170 Canadians indicated that they were English-speaking. As discussed in the Introduction, however, this does not mean that 17.5 million people in Canada would necessarily self-identify as being 'English Canadian'.
Except in Newfoundland and the Maritime provinces, most Canadian English is only subtly different from English spoken in much of the mid-western and western United States. Spoken English in the Maritimes has some resemblance to English of some of the New England states. Newfoundland has the most distinct accent, with the spoken language influenced in particular by Irish immigration. There are a few pronunciations that are distinctive for most English Canadians, such as 'zed' for the last letter of the alphabet.
English Canadian spelling continues to favour most spellings of British English, including 'centre', 'theatre', 'colour' and 'labour', although usage is not universal. Other spellings, such as 'gaol' and 'programme', have disappeared entirely or are in retreat. The principal differences between British and Canadian spelling are twofold: '-ise' and '-yse' words ('organise/organize' and 'analyse' in Britain, 'organize' and 'analyze/analyse' in Canada), and '-e' words ('annexe' and 'grille' in Britain, 'annex' and 'grill' in Canada, but 'axe' in both, 'ax' in the USA). But '-ize' is becoming increasingly common in Britain, bringing British spelling closer to the Canadian standard.
Vocabulary of Canadian English contains a few distinctive words and phrases. In British Columbia, for example, the Chinook word 'skookum' for, variously, 'good' or 'great' or 'reliable' or 'durable', has passed into common use, and the French word 'tuque' for a particular type of winter head covering is in quite widespread use throughout the country.
Languages besides English are spoken extensively in provinces with English-speaking majorities. Besides French (which is an official language of the province of New Brunswick and in the three territories), indigenous languages, including Inuktitut and Cree are widely spoken and are in some instances influencing the language of English speakers, just as traditional First Nations art forms are influencing public art, architecture and symbology in English Canada. Immigrants to Canada from Asia and parts of Europe in particular have brought languages other than English and French to many communities, particularly Toronto, Vancouver and other larger centres. On the west coast, for example, Chinese and Punjabi are taught in some high schools; while on the east coast efforts have been made to preserve the Scots Gaelic language brought by early settlers to Nova Scotia. In the Prairie provinces, and to a lesser degree elsewhere, there are a large number of second-generation and more Ukrainian Canadians who have retained at least partial fluency in the Ukrainian language.
Religion.
The population of the provinces other than Quebec in the 2001 Census is some 22,514,455. It is impossible to know with certainty how many of that number would self-identify as 'English Canadians' under the broadest interpretation of the term. Persons self-identifying with 'English' as their primary ethnic origin as part of the 2001 census - Quebec included - totaled slightly less than 6,000,000 persons. However, many Canadians who identify other ethnic origins for the purpose of the census might identify as 'English Canadian' in the broader sense of 'English-speaking Canadians' and possibly share some cultural affinities with the group identifying itself as 'English Canadian' in the more limited sense.
Of the total population of the provinces outside Quebec, the following numbers provide an approximation of the two largest religious groupings: *Protestant: 8,329,260; *Roman Catholic: 6,997,190.
It is fair to assume that persons identifying themselves as Roman Catholic outside Quebec would include many non-English ethnicities such as Francophone populations, Irish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Hispanic, German, and many other origins.
Those claiming no religious affiliation in 2001 numbered 4,586,900.
For comparison purposes, other religious groups in the provinces other than Quebec in 2001:
In sum, while the single largest religious affiliation of 'English Canadians' - in the Rest of Canada sense of the term - may for convenience be slotted under the different Christian religions called Protestantism, it still represents a minority of the population at less than 37%. So-called 'English Canadians' include a large segment who do not identify as Christian. Even with a clear majority of almost 73%, English Canadian Christians represent a large diversity of beliefs that makes it exceedingly difficult to accurately portray religion as a defining characteristic.
Literature.
Humour, often ironic and self-deprecating, played an important role particularly in early Canadian literature in English, such as Thomas Chandler Haliburton and Stephen Leacock.
In "", Margaret Atwood's seminal book on Canadian Literature published in 1973, the author argues that much of Canadian literature in both English and French is linked thematically to the notion of personal and collective survival. This theme continues to reappear in more recent literary works, such as Yann Martel's "Life of Pi", winner of the 2002 Booker Prize.
In the 1970s authors such as Margaret Laurence in "The Stone Angel" and Robertson Davies in "Fifth Business" explored the changing worlds of small town Manitoba and Ontario respectively. Works of fiction such as these gave an entire generation of Canadians access to literature about themselves and helped shape a more general appreciation of the experiences of English-speaking Canadians in that era.
Arts.
In the early years of the twentieth century painters in both central Canada and the west coast began applying post-impressionist style to Canadian landscape paintings. Painters such as Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven, which included painters such as A.Y. Jackson, captured images of the wilderness in ways that forced English Canadians to discard their conservative and traditional views of art. In British Columbia, Emily Carr, born in Victoria in 1871, spent much of her life painting. Her early paintings of northwest coast aboriginal villages were critical to creating awareness and appreciation of First Nations cultures among English Canadians. The Arctic paintings of Lawren Harris, another member of the Group of Seven, are also highly iconic for English Canadians.
Heroes, heroines and national myths.
From colonial times the arrival and settlement of the first pioneers, the fur trade empire established by the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company - although the fur company histories are more relevant to French Canadians, M√©tis and Scottish Canadians. - and the mass resettlement of refugee Loyalists are important starting points for some English Canadians. Some have argued that the Loyalist myth, so often accepted without second thought, represents also a collective English Canadian myth-making enterprise
The War of 1812 produced one of the earliest national heroes, Laura Secord, who is credited with having made her way through American lines at night to carry a warning to British troops of impending American plans and contributing to the victory at the Battle of Beaver Dams, where the American advance into Upper Canada was turned back.
The War of 1812 also saw the capture and burning of Washington, D.C. by the British in August 1814, an event still remembered in English Canada. The War of 1812 itself, to which Canadian and aboriginal militia forces made important contributions, is viewed as the event that ensured the survival of the colonies that would become Canada, or, as termed by the critic Northrop Frye "in many respects a war of independence for Canada."
There is an element of the heroic that attaches to Sir John A. Macdonald, the Scottish lawyer from Kingston, Ontario who became Canada's first Prime Minister. His weaknesses (such as an alleged fondness for alcohol, and the multifaceted corruption inherent in the Pacific Scandal) and the controversial events surrounding the rebellions in the west have not erased admiration for his accomplishments in nation building for English Canadians. Macdonald's pragmatism laid the foundation of the national myth of the 'two founding nations' (English and French), which was to endure well into the twentieth century among a strong minority of English Canadians and was eventually reflected in the official government policy that flowed from the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism in the 1960s.
Macdonald was also instrumental in the founding of the North-West Mounted Police in 1875, forerunners of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Canada's iconic national police force. The RCMP itself, established to "subdue the West", i.e. the newly acquired Northwest Territories, formerly the HBC's Rupert's Land, as declared in the preamble to its charter. The RCMP, long since eulogized into a moral, symbolic image of Canadian authority, far from its true nature as a paramilitary force commissioned with bringing First Nations and M√©tis to heel, plays a role in English Canada's perception of itself as a nation of essentially law abiding citizens that confederated in 1867 for the purposes of establishing peace, order and good government.
The Klondike Gold Rush of 1898 in the Yukon was another event that resonated in the English Canadian imagination, with its stories of adventure and struggle in a harsh northern environment. The myth of the North itself, the forbidding landscape and difficult climate, peopled by the hardy Inuit is of central importance to English Canadians, from Susanna Moodie (whose 'north' was the 'wilderness' of 1830s southern Ontario) to the present, as the myth of the north is reexamined, challenged and reinvented for an increasingly post-colonial culture.
In the twentieth century Tommy Douglas, the politician from Saskatchewan who is credited with the creation of Canada's programme of universal health care has been recognized as the greatest Canadian in a contest sponsored by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Canada's national public broadcaster. Lester B. Pearson, winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace and Prime Minister of Canada responsible for the adoption of the maple leaf flag, is widely regarded as an English Canadian figure.
Another person who had an enormous impact on English Canadians was British Columbian Terry Fox whose 1981 attempt to run across Canada from St. John's, Newfoundland to the Pacific to raise money for cancer research. Although forced to discontinue the run near Thunder Bay due to a recurrence of his cancer, Terry Fox captured the imagination of millions of Canadians, particularly in the English-speaking provinces. This feat was followed by British Columbian Rick Hansen's successful Man in Motion tour shortly afterwards.
Sports heroes include, among many others, the legendary Wayne Gretzky from Ontario who led the Edmonton Oilers to successive Stanley Cup victories in the 1980s; the women's Olympic hockey team that won the Gold Medal in the 1992 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and Team Canada that won the famed Canada-Russia hockey series in 1972.
Other significant figures include Nellie McClung (activist in politics and women's rights), Emily Carr (post-impressionist artist), Billy Bishop (World War I airman), Dr. Frederick Banting (co-discover of insulin) and Dr.Norman Bethune (doctor in China). Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, is often claimed by English Canada because of his residence on Cape Breton Island, although he was born in Scotland and later moved to the United States.
At the same time, historian and author Charlotte Gray has described Canadians as people who do not do heroes or hero-worship well, preferring instead to celebrate the collective rather than the individual: "qualities that are celebrated in our national life today are collective virtues - the bravery of our peace-keepers, the compassion of all Canadians for Manitoba's flood victims...individualism has never been celebrated in Canada. It is not a useful quality for a loose federation perched on a magnificent and inhospitable landscape..."
The contribution of French-speaking Canadians to the culture of English Canada is significant. Many popular Canadian symbols such as the maple leaf and the beaver were first adopted by Francophones. Francophone sports figures (particularly in hockey and figure-skating) have always been highly regarded. Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Prime Minister in the early 20th century, is viewed as an important statesman in English Canada. A more controversial figure is Pierre Trudeau, who is often praised for his handling of the October Crisis (also known as the FLQ Crisis) and the process of constitutional reform that implemented the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms but who also caused considerable Western Alienation and has been criticised for the critical failure to bring Quebec into the 1982 agreement on constitutional reform. Trudeau was nevertheless ranked 3rd in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's contest to choose The Greatest Canadian. Most recently, Haitian-born Francophone Micha√´lle Jean, the current Governor-General, has overcome some initial misgivings regarding her appointment. The motto chosen for her arms, "Briser les solitudes" (break down the solitudes), echoes one of the significant works of early English Canadian fiction, Hugh MacLennan's "Two Solitudes" which describes the sometimes painful separateness dividing Canada's English and French-speaking populations.
Canada's role in the First and Second World Wars played a large part in the political evolution of Canada and the identity of English Canadians. After the fall of France in 1940 and prior to the entry of the United States into the war in 1942, Canada saw itself as Britain's principal ally against Adolf Hitler. The well-known poem "In Flanders Fields", written during the First World War by John McCrae of Guelph, Ontario, is associated with Remembrance Day.
Popular culture.
The RCMP "Mountie" has become a figure associated with Canada in the popular imagination of not only Canada, but other countries as well. Although it has many Francophone officers, in popular culture the mountie has been typically represented by an anglophone, such as Dudley Do-Right, Benton Fraser or Sergeant Preston of the Yukon. The myth of the stalwart (if somewhat rustic) heroic Canadian also appeared in the form of Johnny Canuck, a comic book figure of the mid-twentieth century.
"Anne of Green Gables" by Lucy Maud Montgomery of Prince Edward Island is one of English Canada's best known contribution to general popular culture. The themes of gentle slapstick and ironic but affectionate observation of small-town Canadian life that appeared in the work of Stephen Leacock carried forward into the later part of the twentieth century to reappear in successful television sitcoms such as "The Beachcombers", "Corner Gas" and "Little Mosque on the Prairie".
Canadian humour took on an even broader form in the comedy of "SCTV", in particular the Great White North sketches, "The Red Green Show" and more recently "Trailer Park Boys".
Traditional music in much of English-speaking Canada has sources in the music of Scotland and Ireland, brought to Newfoundland and the Maritime provinces in the 19th century. In the late 20th Century, Maritime artists, particularly musicians from Cape Breton Island such as Rita MacNeil, the Rankin Family, Natalie MacMaster and Ashley MacIsaac and Great Big Sea from Newfoundland achieved substantial popularity and influence throughout English Canada. A Celtic influence is similarly felt in the work of musicians from other parts of Canada, such as Spirit of the West, from British Columbia, or Manitoba-born Loreena McKennitt.

Lloyd Hagger (7 December 1898 ‚Äì ??) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Geelong Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL) from 1917 to 1929. 
Recruited from Barwon in the Geelong & District Football Association, Hagger played as a key position forward and was known for his high marking and ability to kick goals from difficult angles. Named captain-coach of Geelong in 1924, Hagger was captain for only one season, handing the job over to Cliff Rankin. In 1925 Geelong won the premiership and Hagger was the League's leading goalkicker, with 78 for the season. He also regularly played for Victoria in interstate matches. At the 1924 Hobart Carnival, Hagger, playing for Victoria against Western Australia, kicked seven goals in Victoria's eight point win. Late in the match Hagger was momentarily knocked out but recovered in time to refuse to leave the ground after a stretcher had been called.
Hagger had a reputation for being very talkative during gameplay. He also worked as a cartoonist for "The Sun News-Pictorial".

Herman Dehlman

Herman J. Dehlman (1852 ‚Äì March 13, 1885), nicknamed "Dutch", was an American Major League Baseball first baseman who played a total of six seasons at the top level of professional baseball, four in the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (National Association), and two in the National League, a "Major League".
Career.
He began his professional career with the Chelsea, New York base ball club, before making his debut with the Brooklyn Atlantics of the National Association on May 2, 1872. While playing in all 37 of the team's games that season, 36 of them as the starting first baseman, he batted .220 and scored 30 runs.
In 1873, Dehlman established career highs in several offensive categories, such as runs scored (50), batting average (.235), and on-base percentage (.265). He, additionally, led all first basemen in games played with 54, and led the league in a couple of defensive categories such as putouts and double plays. He played one more season in Brooklyn, in 1874, and he batted .225 in 53 games.
Dehlman joined the St. Louis Brown Stockings for the 1875 season, again as the starting first baseman. Despite a low batting average of .224, it was his most productive season offensively. He played in a career high 67 games, while also establishing career highs in hits (57), doubles (12), triples, and slugging percentage (.285). He was among the leaders with career highs in stolen bases (23), and led the league with 11 bases on balls.
The National Association folded following the 1875 season, which was replaced by the National League, the first "Major" league in baseball history. Dehlman continued to play with the Brown Stockings when they made the move to the new league. According to official resources, Dehlman never managed, known in the day as a "Team Captain", but he is credited as being a player-captain-manager for the Brown Stockings in 1876 (manager referring to a similar capacity to what a General Manager does in the modern game). Records indicate the on-field managers for that season as Mase Graffen and George McManus. In 64 games that season, he batted a career low .184, but did lead the league in putouts for the third time in his career. His playing career lasted one more season with the Brown Stockings, but his hitting did not improve, so consequently, Dehlman's position at first base was taken over by Art Croft during the 1877 season as St. Louis slipped to fourth place. He finished 307 game career with a .214 batting average, scored 226 runs, and had 83 RBIs.
Post-career.
After his playing days were over, Dehlman became the manager for the professional baseball team in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Before the 1885 season began, the Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania professional baseball club hired him as their team manager. Shortly after arriving in town, he contracted typhoid fever and died a few days later at the age of 33. He was survived by his wife and his six year old son, and is interred at City Cemetery in Wilkes-Barre.

History of Bangladeshis in the United Kingdom

Bangladeshis are one of the largest immigrant communities in the United Kingdom. Significant numbers of ethnic Bengalis arrived as early as the 17th century, including Sylhetis, who mostly arrived as "lascar" seamen working on ships. Following the founding of Bangladesh in 1971, a large immigration to Britain took place during the 1970s, leading to the establishment of a British Bangladeshi community. Bangladeshis were encouraged to move to Britain during that decade because of changes in immigration laws, natural disasters such as the Bhola cyclone, the Bangladesh Liberation War against Pakistan, and the desire to escape poverty, and the perception of a better living led Sylheti men bringing their families. They initially experienced high rates of racial attacks and unemployment, but have since integrated into British society over the last several decades.
Early history of Bengalis in Britain.
Throughout the 17th to early 20th centuries, the British East India Company brought over thousands of South Asian scholars, "lascars" and workers, who were mostly Bengali and Muslim, to Britain. Due to the majority of early Bengali immigrants being "lascar" seamen, the earliest Muslim communities were found in port towns. Naval cooks also came, many of them from the Sylhet Division of what is now Bangladesh. One of the most famous early Bengali Muslim immigrants to Britain was Sake Dean Mahomet, a captain of the British East India Company. In 1810, he founded London's first Indian restaurant, the Hindoostane Coffee House. He is also reputed for introducing shampoo and therapeutic massage to the United Kingdom. There are other records of Sylhetis working in London restaurants since at least 1873. By the time World War I began, there were 51,616 South Asian "lascars" living in Britain, the majority of whom were of Bengali descent.
Due to the lack of Bengali women in Britain at the time, most early Bengali immigrants settled down and took local white British wives. As a result, most early British-born Bengalis were usually 'mixed-race' ('Anglo-Indian' or 'Eurasian'), famous examples including Albert Mahomet and Frederick Akbar Mahomed. Most of these 'mixed-race' offspring also assimilated into British society through marriage with the local white population, thus there was never a permanent British Bengali community until Bangladeshi women began arriving in large numbers from the 1970s, after which a majority of Bangladeshis chose to marry among one another, leading to the establishment of a permanent British Bangladeshi community.
Causes of immigration.
The reasons why Bangladeshis immigrated to the United Kingdom include the need to find work, earn a better living and to escape conflict. Large numbers of Bangladeshi men emigrated to London to search for employment during the 1950s and the 1960s. Bangladesh has witnessed a series of political upheavals, starting with the end of British India in 1947 when countries were partitioned by religious terms. The majority of these people settled in industrial cities and towns such as Birmingham, Luton, Bedford, Oldham, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Liverpool, Sunderland and Tower Hamlets, particularly around Spitalfields and Brick Lane. Many of them came from the Sylhet region - which is located in the north-east of Bangladesh. 
In the 1970s, changes in immigration laws encouraged a wave of Bangladeshis to come to the UK and settle. Job opportunities were initially limited to low paid sectors, with unskilled jobs in small factories and the textile trade being especially common. But when the 'Indian' restaurant business developed, some Sylhetis started to open cafes as businesses. From these small beginnings and developments, a network of Bangladeshi restaurants, shops and banks became established in Brick Lane and the surrounding areas. The influence of Bangladeshi culture and diversity can be seen across London in boroughs such as Tower Hamlets, Newham, Camden and Southwark
Bangladesh Liberation War.
During 1971 East Pakistan (known today as Bangladesh) went to war against West Pakistan (Pakistan) for independence, in what was known as the Bangladesh Liberation War. The Pakistani infantry then started occupy the Sylhet region where many Bangladeshis come from; this led some people to join the Mukti Bahini in their defense and a battle against the Pakistanis. For example, Muhammad Ataul Gani Osmani a Sylheti, who was in command of the Teliapara Tea Estate in Sylhet, who then became the commander-in-chief of the Bangladesh Armed Forces in April 1971, was one of many who were part of the success of the war. He died in 1984 in London where he spent his time diagnosed with cancer, living with his family in the UK. However, even though there were many heroic efforts by Sylhetis during the war, this also led large numbers of Sylhetis to flee, arriving in the UK during the 1970s. 
Bengalis in Britain also took part in the War of Independence. In August 1969, Bangladeshi settlers in Birmingham formed East Pakistan Liberation Front. Its President was Abdus Sabur Choudhury and Secretary was Abdul Aziz Bhuyan. There was a fortnightly called Bidrohi Bangla published by Mr Mustafizur Rahman. Getting the news of Pakistani military action in 25 March 1971 there was a movement in Birmingham Smallheath Park. Over 10 thousand Bangali were present there. In that gathering, East Pakistan Liberation Front was abolished and Bangladesh Action Committee was formed. Justice Abu Saeed Chowdhury was its President and Abdul Aziz Bhuyan was Secretary. 
Actions and Movements:
- 5 March 1971 - Demonstration in front Pakistan High Commission in London. Flag burning and memorandum handover to high commissioner for liberation
- 7 March 1971 all Party Gathering in Smallheath Park Birmingham renounce of deceleration of Independence,
- 28 March uplifting Bangladesh Flag in Smallheath Park Birmingham.
- 3 May 1971 300 MP of British Parliament agreed to support Bangladesh movement
- 21 June 1971 120 Bengali went to Paris to demonstrate against Pakistan Aid Consortium of 12 developed countries. Pakistan did not get any Aid.
- 30 June 1971 Pakistani ship Padma full of arms and ammunitions was in the jetty of Montreal sea port Canada. Bangladesh Action Committee demonstrated in front of Canadian High Commission and finally Canadian government ceased it.
After all those movements and Demonstrations western media, activists and governments went against Pakistan and helped Bangladesh liberation. Bengalis in Britain played a significant role in the independence of Bangladesh.
First Bangladeshi settlers.
Bangladeshis first started arriving in the UK in large numbers in the 1970s and mostly settled in and around the Brick Lane area of East London. However, some Bengalis had been present in the country as early as the 1920s. Author Caroline Adams records one instance in 1925 when a lost Bengali searching for other Bengali settlers in London was told by a policeman: 'you better go on until you smell curry'. At this time, there were many more Jewish people in London than there were Bengalis. Some of these were Sylhetis who came to Britain by sea after working as lascars on ships. One of the earliest Bengali immigrants to Britain was Sake Dean Mahomed, a captain of the British East India Company. In 1810, he founded London's first Indian restaurant, the Hindoostane Coffee House. He is also reputed for introducing shampoo and therapeutic massage in Britain.
Bangladeshis who came to the UK anticipated the country would provide them with great opportunities. However, there were various problems experienced by many of these immigrants. They lived and worked in cramped basements and attics in Tower Hamlets. Centuries earlier, these same properties had housed Huguenot immigrants who weaved silk and worked for very long hours in badly heated and poorly lit workshops. The Bengalis found they could not interact with the English-speaking population, and therefore could not enter higher education. There has been a decline in business throughout East London, which has led to unemployment among Bangladeshi workers. The garment manufacturing industry was part of this decline. The Bangladeshis instead became cooks, waiters and mechanics, but their progress up the social and economic ladder was a slow one. The men were often illiterate, poorly educated, and spoke little English. They became easy targets for some of their ruthless compatriots who seized control of their housing in Whitechapel in the 1970s and sold the properties onto other Sylhetis, many of who had no legal claim to the buildings.
By 1970, Brick Lane, and many of the streets around it, had become predominantly Bengali. The Jewish bakeries were turned into curry houses, the jewellery shops were turned into sari stores, and the synagogues into dress factories. In 1976, the synagogue at the corner of Fournier Street and Brick Lane became the Jamme Masjid (community mosque). The building that now houses the Jamme Masjid represents the history of successive communities of immigrants in this part of London. In 1743, this same building had been built as a French Protestant Church. In 1819, it became a Methodist Chapel, and then in 1898, it was used by Jewish people as the Spitalfields Great Synagogue. Following the increase in the number of Bengalis in the area, the Jews migrated to outlying suburbs of London, as they integrated with the majority British population. They sold off the synagogue, which then became the Jamme Masjid or 'Great London Mosque', which continues to serve the Bangladeshi community to this day. A film released in 2007, named after the street of Brick Lane itself, is based on a novel by author Monica Ali.
Racial violence.
1970s and Altab Ali.
In the 1970s, there was a large rise in the number of attacks on Bangladeshis. Racial tensions in the area had been simmering for 40 years, since Oswald Mosley incited attacks on the older Jewish communities in the 1930s. White power skinhead gangs began to roam the Brick Lane area, where they vandalised property and spat at Bengali children. In Bethnal Green, National Front members handed out leaflets on the streets and assembled people at a pub in Cheshire Street. Bengali children were allowed out of school early, with their mothers walking to work in groups to shield them from potential violence. Parents began to start imposing curfews on their children for their own safety. Later, the Tower Hamlets council fitted their flats with fire-proof letterboxes to protect Bangladeshi tenants from racially motivated arson.
Residents began to fight back by creating committees and youth groups such as the Bangladesh Youth Movement, which was formed by young activists led by Shajahan Lutfur. One 4 May 1978, Altab Ali, a 25 year old was murdered in a racist attack, as he walked home from work. The murder took place near the corner of Adler Street and Whitechapel Road by St Mary's Churchyard. The killers were three teenage boys, Roy Arnold (17-year old from Limehouse), Carl Ludlow (17-year old from Bow) and unnamed mixed race 16-year old boy who killed him, and they left a message on a nearby wall which said, "We‚Äôre back". This then led to over 7,000 Bangladeshis including others to take part in a demonstration against racist violence and marched behind Altab Ali‚Äôs coffin to Number 10 Downing Street. Then on September 1978, the National Front moved its headquarters from Teddington in West London to Great Eastern Street, a few minutes' walk from Brick Lane. 
The name Altab Ali became associated with a movement of resistance against racist attacks, and remains linked with this struggle for human rights to this day. His murder was the trigger for the first significant political organisation against racism by local Bangladeshis. Today‚Äôs phenomenal identification and association of British Bangladeshis with Tower Hamlets still owes much to this campaign. A park on Whitechapel Road is named after Altab Ali. The park is the main destination for demonstrations for the local people as of today. At the entrance to the park there is an arch created by David Peterson, developed as a memorial to Altab Ali and other victims of racist attacks. The arch incorporates a complex Bengali-style pattern, meant to show the merging of different cultures in East London.
1990s.
A few racial violence started occur in 1993 by the British National Party (BNP) where a few Bangladeshi students were severely injured. Racial violence started to occur again against the Bangladeshis and other ethnic groups, when during 1993 when the BNP party ‚Äî regarded as a racist party, won a seat in the Isle of Dogs, Tower Hamlets. The party started to sell their newspapers in Brick Lane, and later that year, some party members attacked young Bangladeshi students. Both were seriously injured and were in a coma. Demonstrations later started to occur against the party, calling for a shut down, and led the party to abandon their normal paper-sell proceedings. One of the two Bangladeshis attacked was Quaddas Ali on September 1993, a 17 year old who was a student at Tower Hamlets College. In February 1994, Muktar Ahmed aged 19, was savagely beaten by a group of 20 white youths in Bethnal Green. This was followed by an attack by white youths the next day who were armed with iron bars and dogs, attacked students from Tower Hamlets College who were taking their lunch break in the nearby park. The next day another 14 year old Bengali boy was stabbed in the face by four men on Bethnal Green Road.
Official recognition.
In April 2001, the London Borough of Tower Hamlets council officially renamed the 'Spitalfields' electoral ward to "Spitalfields and Banglatown". Surrounding streets were redecorated, with lamp posts painted in green and red, which are the colours of the Bangladeshi flag.

Pete Morton

Pete Morton is a folk singer-songwriter who lives in London, England.
Biography.
Morton was born in Leicester, England on July 30, 1964, and was educated at Countesthorpe Community College where he spent most of his time in the music block learning guitar and playing new wave and punk songs. He was lead singer, songwriter and rhythm guitarist in his two school bands: The Mafia, and Tone Deaf. He left school at 16 in 1980. It was during this summer that he discovered folk music, when hearing a friend's father playing a Buffy Sainte-Marie record. This had a profound effect which led him to buy an acoustic guitar and learn songs from early 60s protest singers. He started busking and visiting folk clubs, travelling around the UK and Europe. He began learning traditional songs as well as writing his own songs mainly of social commentary.
Morton signed to Harbourtown Records in 1987, a label started by Gordon Jones and Bob Thomas of Scottish Folk Band, Silly Wizard. His first album, "Frivolous Love" was met with high critical acclaim, of which "The Guardian" called him "a revelation" and was voted the most promising newcomer by "FRoots" magazine the year after. His second album, "One Big Joke" (1988), was also positively received and he was referred to in a review by "FRoots", as one of the best the British roots scene has produced in living memory. The first album he released on CD was "Mad World Blues" (1991). Throughout the early nineties Pete toured extensively with Roger Wilson (fiddle, vocals and Guitar) and Simon Edwards (Button Accordion and vocals) throughout Europe producing a powerful and unique rocky-folk sound and recorded a double CD of this collaboration on Harbourtown Records: "Self Destructive Fools". "Courage, love and Grace" (1994) brought his songwriting back to public attention. He followed this with a collection of traditional songs on the CD, "Trespass" (1998). Since this time, he has constantly toured throughout North America and Europe, as well as producing a CD with friend Jo Freya, plus three more CDs of his own songs: "Hunting the Heart" (2000), "Swarthmoor" (2003), and "Flying an Unknown Flag" (2005). In 2007, he left Harbourtown Records to re-work his most requested songs with the album "Napoleon Jukebox" (2007), followed a year later with "Casa Abierta" (2008). This was a collection of songs in ten different languages, of which he had a teacher for each song, and the album was partly in aid of the Gambian schools trust. It was produced with Simon Squire in Crewkerne, Somerset, England. He continues to perform as Pete Morton, but now divides his time, performing as the dancer and singer, Geoff Chaucer Junior ‚Äì a comedy character. He performs "A Random History of Rock n Roll in Middle English" throughout the UK.
A new CD of his own original songs, produced by Dawson Smith, in his hometown of Leicester, is due for release in the spring of 2010.
According to "fRoots", Morton "is amongst the best that the British roots music scene has produced in living memory."

<doc id="20557060" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20557060" title="Voldo">
Voldo

Character design.
As a character introduced in "Soul Edge", Voldo's weapon, dual hand katars designed to be unique amongst the other weapons in the game, were selected before other elements of the character. His design and concept were then built to revolve around it, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. During Voldo's development, several alternate designs were considered, ranging from a balding, long haired man with a goatee to a rich nobleman wielding a katar on his right hand and a sickle in his left. After his appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist, his character was rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on him. During this phase the team additionally worked with the "Soul Edge" story creators, refining the character's own role in the plot as needed throughout development.
Unlike other characters in the series, a majority of Voldo's movements were created from Naotake Hirata's imagination and not motion capture. However the head of Team Soul's motion capture department, Kent Kojima, noticed one particular actor working with them was highly flexible and able to mimic Voldo. Impressed, Kojima utilized him in motion capture sessions for some of the character's animations for "Soulcalibur III", stating in a later interview "I was astonished that a human being could actually move like that. It left quite an impression on me. You probably can't tell which part is motion capture and what was just animated by hand by our animator."
In video games.
Voldo was the right-hand man of Italian weapons merchant Vercci, also known as the "Merchant of Death". Vercci desired Soul Edge to form part of his collection of rare weapons, and Voldo stood as the head of the expeditions in his search, even contracting the services of the feared Spanish Captain Cervantes de Leon, and later accompanied Vercci when he decided to take the search personally. When word came that the Italian Wars broke on Italy and that Vercci's possessions were the first targets, Vercci became angry and moved his fleet, his only remaining possession, to an uninhabited island off the coast of Sicily. After construction of Vercci's vault was completed Voldo was instructed to slay the sailors that helped in the construction to avoid the location of Vercci's "Money Pit" being revealed. Voldo would remain sealed underground, becoming blind and insane in the process. He became the guardian of the tomb and began slaying those who ventured to steal, making rumors of the island, its treasures and its "ghost guardian" spread around the globe. Years later, Voldo would hear his master's voice commanding him to search for Soul Edge once again, making him leave the tomb.
In the sequel "Soulcalibur", Voldo's search for Soul Edge ended in failure, and he returned to find the Money Pit flooded by a storm. After saving what he could, Voldo remained in the vault, later to reemerge from the pit following a woman with the essence of Soul Edge, Ivy, who tried to find leads on the sword for herself. In "Soulcalibur II" Voldo returns to the Money Pit after taking Yoshimitsu's katana, mistaking it for Soul Edge due to its evil aura. Voldo realized it was not Soul Edge and set outside on a new search, collecting its fragments along the way.
His profile in "Soulcalibur III" reveals that during one of his periodic visits to the Pit, Voldo found the tomb ransacked and the sword he mistook for Soul Edge stolen alongside the fragments he collected in his travels. Since the thieves were apparently interested in Soul Edge, he decided to track them down and force them to reveal any information they may possess regarding the sword. He also came to realize he was eventually going to die and leave the pit unprotected, so he began to search for a worthy successor as well. During the events leading up to "Soulcalibur IV", Voldo managed to locate Soul Edge at Ostrheinsburg, resting in the hands of the Azure Knight. After finally claiming Soul Edge for his master, a familiar voice spoke to him, instructing him to protect Soul Edge. However, the voice belonged not to Vercci, but Soul Edge, which assumed his form in Voldo's mind. 
Cultural impact.
Promotion and merchandising.
In August 2003, Todd McFarlane Productions released a Voldo sculpture amongst a set of five based on characters from "Soulcalibur II". The immobile figure was modeled after his primary outfit and stood six inches tall with a base. In 2006, Namco released a Voldo figurine as part of a "Soulcalibur III" set based upon his promotional artwork for the game. While not posable, the PVC figure came with three interchangeable weapons for it to hold; an alternate color version was later released in a secondary set.
Reception.
Voldo's attire and unusual fighting style has been a source of discussion regarding the character by several sources. In the book "Trigger Happy", Steven Poole described him as "a triumph of iconic or pictorial representation", contrasting him against abstract character Pac-Man. Game Chronicles described Voldo as "that guy is sick...in more ways than one." ' described Voldo as "nothing if not the master of freakiness." Game Vortex reviewer Robert Perkins described him as "a warrior that can best be described as martial artist/contortionist meets "Edward Scissorhands"." "Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine" noted him in their "Characters with Character" article, citing him as a staff favorite but also for his bizarreness. "The New York Times" described him as "perhaps the oddest character ever to appear in this genre", noting similarity between his movements and a go-go dancer. The article later added after a discussion of his attire and weaponry "the character is a pastiche of every Satanist stereotype imaginable. Why isn't Jerry Falwell leading an anti-Soul Calibur campaign?"
In a 2002 poll by Namco prior to the release of "Soul Calibur II" regarding their favorite character, Voldo placed third, with 13% of the tally. Voldo placed fourth in UGO.com's "Top 11 SoulCalibur Fighters" article, stating "Voldo is here because he's top-tier fighter who also happens to be a highly skilled contortionist and an S&M fetishist." IGN listed Voldo as one of the series' top ten fighters at number four, stating "Voldo scares us. He isn't a man so much as a twisted mass of writhing muscle, all wrapped up and held together in 16th-Century bondage gear...Even a fighter who prepares for all possible opponents has taken Voldo's unique moveset into account." GameDaily ranked him number two on their "Top 10 Ugliest Game Characters" article, noting his lack of clothes and describing him as a "one-man freak show, plain and simple." In another article, they listed the "unorthodox fighter" as one of the top 25 video game archetypes, citing Voldo as an example of this due to his flamboyant style and difficult control. He was ranked first on UGO Networks's list of "25 Most Memorable Italians in Video Games". "Complex" included him among the video game characters who look like sex offenders. They also enlisted the 20 best characters from the series, ranking him the fourth best character.

English American

English Americans, also referred to as Anglo-Americans, are Americans whose ancestry originates wholly or partly in England.
According to American Community Survey in 2010 data, Americans reporting English ancestry made up an estimated 9.0% of the total U.S. population, and form the third largest European ancestry group after German Americans and Irish Americans.
However, demographers regard this as an undercount, as the index of inconsistency is high, and many, if not most, people from English stock have a tendency to identify simply as Americans or, if of mixed European ancestry, identify with a more recent and differentiated ethnic group. Throughout the nineteenth century, England was the largest investor in American land development, railroads, mining, cattle ranching, and heavy industry. Perhaps because English settlers gained easy acceptance, they founded few organizations dedicated to preserving the traditions of their homeland. Scotch-Irish Americans are descendants of Lowland Scots and Northern English (specifically: County Durham, Cumberland, Northumberland and Westmorland) settlers who colonized Ireland during the Plantation of Ulster in the 17th century.
In the 1980 United States Census, over 49 million (49,598,035) Americans claimed English ancestry, at the time around 26.34% of the total population and largest reported group which, even today, would make them the largest ethnic group in the United States. This suggests that the current reported number is vastly underestimated.
In 1982, an opinion poll organization showed respondents a card listing a number of ethnic groups and asked, "Thinking both of what they have contributed to this country and have gotten from this country, for each one tell me whether you think, on balance, they've been a good or a bad thing for this country". The English were the top ethnic group with 66% saying they were a good thing for the United States, followed by the Irish at 62%.
The overwhelming majority of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America were of English extraction, including Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, John Adams, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson.
As with most immigrant groups, the English later sought economic prosperity and began migrating in large numbers without state support, particularly in the 19th century.
Sense of identity.
Americans of English heritage are often seen, and identify, as simply "American" due to the many cultural ties between the two countries and their impact on the population of the United States of America, which has hardly disappeared. In the context of other European ethnic groups (as opposed to the native population), this may be due to the early establishment of English settlements, as well as a non-English population that took time to emigrate to establish significant communities.
In the succeeding years since the founding of the United States of America, English-Americans have been less likely to proclaim their heritage in the face of the upsurge of cultural and ethnic pride by African-Americans, Irish-Americans, Scottish-Americans, Italian-Americans or other ethnic groups. While there may be many reasons for this, after centuries of intermarriage and internal geographic mobility, many are unable to determine a specific English origin. For these reasons, no other part of the pluralist American society is so difficult to describe as a separate entity as the English. English immigrants were and are often seen as an invisible ethnic group, due to the length of time their ancestors may have been in the United States, as the majority of the founding colonists were English people.
There is little or no celebration of the English Patron Saint St. George's Day other than by the Boy Scouts of America .
Number of English Americans.
From the time of the first permanent English presence in the New World until 1900, these immigrants outnumbered all others, therefore the cultural pattern had been firmly established as the American model.
1775 estimates.
According to the United States Historical Census Data Base (USHCDB) (2002), the ethnic populations in the American Colonies of 1775 were:
1790 Census.
The United States Census of 1790 was the first census conducted in the United States. It was conducted on August 2, 1790.
The ancestry of the 3,929,214 population in 1790 has been estimated by various sources by sampling last names in the very first United States official census and assigning them a country of origin.
The estimate results indicate that people of English ancestry made up about 47.5% of the total population or 60.9% of the European American population. Some 80.7% of the total United States population was of European heritage.
Around 757,208 were of African descent with 697,624 being slaves. Of the remaining population, more than 75% was of British origin.
The states with the highest percentage of English ancestry were Massachusetts 82%, Vermont 76%, Rhode Island 71%, Virginia including West Virginia 68.5%, Connecticut 67%, Maryland incl.DC 64.5%, North Carolina 66%, New Hampshire 61%, South Carolina 60.2%, Maine 60%, Delaware 60%, Kentucky and Tennessee 57.9%, Georgia 57.4%, New York 52%, New Jersey 47%, Pennsylvania 35.3%,
2000 Census.
In the 2000 census, 24.5 million Americans reported English ancestry, 8.7% of the total U.S. population. This estimate is probably a serious undercount by over 30 million given that, in the 1980 census, around 50 million citizens claimed to be of at least partial English ancestry. In 1980, 23,748,772 Americans claimed wholly English ancestry and another 25,849,263 claimed English along with another ethnic ancestry.
In 1860, an estimated 11 million or almost 35% of the population of the United States was wholly or primarily of English ancestry. The population has increased by almost ten times the numbers in 1860. As with any ethnicity, Americans of English descent may choose to identify themselves as just 'American ethnicity' if their ancestry has been in the United States for many generations or if, for the same reason, they are unaware of their lineages.
English expatriates.
In total, there are estimated to be around 678,000 British born expatriates in the United States with the majority of these being English. By American definition there are around 540,000 English people of any race in the United States, 40,000 Asian English, 20,000 Black British people and approximately 10,000 people of a mixed background.
Distribution.
Following are the top 20 highest percentages of people of English ancestry, in U.S. communities with 500 or more total inhabitants (for the total list of the 101 communities, see the reference):
States.
English Americans are found in large numbers throughout America, particularly in the Northeast, South and West. According to the 2000 US census, the 10 states with the largest populations of self reported English Americans are
English was the highest reported European ancestry in the states of Maine, Vermont and Utah; joint highest along with German in the Carolinas.

History.
Early settlement and colonization.
English settlement in America began with Jamestown in the Virginia Colony in 1607. With the permission of James I, three ships (the "Susan Constant, The Discovery", and "The God Speed") sailed from England and landed at Cape Henry in April, under the captainship of Christopher Newport, who had been hired by the London Company to lead expeditions to what is now America.
The second successful colony was Plymouth Colony, founded in 1620 by people who later became known as the Pilgrims. Fleeing religious persecution in the East Midlands in England, they first went to Holland, but feared losing their English identity. Because of this, they chose to relocate to the New World, with their voyage being financed by English investors. In September 1620, 102 passengers set sail aboard the "Mayflower", eventually settling at Plymouth Colony in November. This story has become a central theme in the United States cultural identity.
A number of English colonies were established under a system of proprietary governors, who were appointed under mercantile charters to English joint stock companies to found and run settlements.
England also took over the Dutch colony of New Netherland (including the New Amsterdam settlement), renaming it the Province of New York in 1664. With New Netherland, the English came to control the former New Sweden (in what is now Delaware), which the Dutch had conquered from Sweden earlier. This became part of Pennsylvania.
English immigration after 1776.
An estimated 3.5 million English immigrated to the U.S. after 1776. English settlers provided a steady and substantial influx throughout the nineteenth century. The first wave of increasing English immigration began in the late 1820s and was sustained by unrest in the United Kingdom until it peaked in 1842 and declined slightly for nearly a decade. Most of these were small farmers and tenant farmers from depressed areas in rural counties in southern and western England and urban laborers who fled from the depressions and from the social and industrial changes of the late 1820s-1840s. While some English immigrants were drawn by dreams of creating model utopian societies in America, most others were attracted by the lure of new lands, textile factories, railroads, and the expansion of mining.
A number of English settlers moved to the United States from Australia in the 1850s (then a British political territory), when the California Gold Rush boomed; these included the so-called "Sydney Ducks" ("see Australian Americans").
During the last years of the 1860s, annual English immigration increased to over 60,000 and continued to rise to over 75,000 per year in 1872, before experiencing a decline. The final and most sustained wave of immigration began in 1879 and lasted until the depression of 1893. During this period English annual immigration averaged more than 82,000, with peaks in 1882 and 1888 and did not drop significantly until the financial panic of 1893. The building of America's transcontinental railroads, the settlement of the great plains, and industrialization attracted skilled and professional emigrants from England. Also, cheaper steamship fares enabled unskilled urban workers to come to America, and unskilled and semiskilled laborers, miners, and building trades workers made up the majority of these new English immigrants. While most settled in America, a number of skilled craftsmen remained itinerant, returning to England after a season or two of work. Groups of English immigrants came to America as missionaries for the Salvation Army and to work with the activities of the Evangelical and LDS Churches.
The depression of 1893 sharply decreased English emigration to the United States, and it stayed low for much of the twentieth century. This decline reversed itself in the decade of World War II when over 100,000 English (18 percent of all European immigrants) came from England. In this group was a large contingent of war brides who came between 1945 and 1948. In these years four women emigrated from England for every man. In the 1950s, English immigration increased to over 150,000.and rose to 170,000 in the 1960s. While differences developed, it is not surprising that English immigrants had little difficulty in assimilating to American life. The American resentment against the policies of the British government was rarely transferred to English settlers who came to America in the first decades of the nineteenth century.
Throughout American history, English immigrants and their descendants have been prominent in every level of government and in every aspect of American life. Eight of the first ten American presidents and more than that proportion of the 42 presidents, as well as the majority of sitting congressmen and congresswomen, are descended from English ancestors. The descendants of English expatriates are so numerous and so well integrated in American life that it is impossible to identify all of them. While they are the third largest ethnic nationality self reported in the 1990 census, they retain such a pervasive representation at every level of national and state government that, on any list of American senators, Supreme Court judges, governors, or legislators, they would constitute a plurality if not an outright majority. Today it is estimated that over 80 million Americans are of English ancestry, not including African Americans, who also have some English ancestry.
Political involvement.
Colonial period.
As the earliest colonists of the United States, settlers from England and their descendants often held positions of power and made or helped make laws, often because many had been involved in government back in England. In the original 13 colonies, most laws contained elements found in the English common law system.
The Founding Fathers.
The lineage of most of the Founding Fathers was English. Such persons include Samuel Adams. Other signatories of the Declaration of Independence, such as Robert Morris were English born. Of the "Committee of Five" (the group delegated to draft the Declaration of Independence), John Adams of Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, and Roger Sherman of Connecticut had English roots.
The United States Declaration of Independence was written primarily by Thomas Jefferson.
Language.
The English have contributed greatly to American life. Today, English is the most commonly spoken language in the U.S, where it is estimated that two thirds of all native speakers of English live.
English was inherited from English colonization, and it is spoken by the vast majority of the population. It serves as the "de facto" official language: the language in which government business is carried out. According to the 1990 census, 94% of the U.S. population speak only English. Adding those who speak English "well" or "very well" brings this figure to 96%. Only 0.8% speak no English at all as compared with 3.6% in 1890. American English differs from British English in a number of ways, the most striking being in terms of pronunciation (for example, American English retains voicing of the letter "R" after vowels, unlike standard British English) and spelling (a classic example being the "u" in words such as "color", "favor" (USA) vs "colour", "favour" (UK)). Less obvious differences are present in grammar, vocabulary, and slang usage. The differences are rarely a barrier to effective communication between American English and British English speakers, but there are certainly enough differences to cause occasional misunderstandings, usually surrounding slang or region dialect differences. The two are however generally treated as mutually intelligible.
Some states, like California, have amended their constitutions to make English the only official language, but in practice, this only means that official government documents must "at least" be in English, and "does not" mean that they should be exclusively available only in English. For example, the standard California Class C driver's license examination is available in 32 different languages.
Expressions.
"In for a penny, in for a pound" is an expression to mean, ("if you're going to take a risk at all, you might as well make it a big risk"), is used in the United States which dates back to the colonial period, when cash in the colonies was denominated in Pounds, shillings and Pence.
Today, the one-cent coin is commonly known as a penny. A modern alternative expression is "In for a dime, in for a dollar".
American cultural icons.
Much of American culture also shows influences from English culture.
Music.
Another area of cultural influence are American Patriotic songs:
Before 1931, other songs served as the hymns of American officialdom.
Motorcycle maker.
Automobile maker
Ford Motor Company: founded by Henry Ford, born to an English father, William Ford
Beverages.
Two of the world's most famous soft drinks were invented by Americans of English descent. Pemberton and Alderton are both English surnames.
Coca-Cola was formulated at the Eagle Drug and Chemical Company, a drugstore in Columbus, Georgia by John Pemberton, originally as a coca wine called Pemberton's French Wine Cocoa.
The first sales were at Jacob's Pharmacy in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 8, 1886. It was initially sold as a patent medicine for five cents a glass at soda fountains, which were popular in the United States at the time due to the belief that carbonated water was good for the health. Pemberton claimed Coca-Cola cured many diseases, including morphine addiction, dyspepsia, neurasthenia, headache, and impotence. Pemberton ran the first advertisement for the beverage on May 29 of the same year in the "Atlanta Journal".
Dr Pepper is a soft drink and was invented in the 1880s by pharmacist Charles Alderton in Waco, Texas, and first made in 1885. Charles Courtice Alderton was born in Brooklyn, New York to English parents who was later sent to England to be educated.
It is the oldest of the major brand soft drinks in America.
English family names.
Of the top ten family names in the United States, eight have English origins or having possible mixed British Isles heritage, the other two being of Spanish origin. This is the first time two surnames of non-British Isles origin have been in the top 10 most common family names.
Many African Americans have their origins in slavery (i.e. slave name). Many of them came to bear the surnames of their former owners. Many freed slaves either created family names themselves or adopted the name of their former master.
According to 2000 U.S. Census data, the top ten surnames in the United States are: In the last UK Census in 2001, surnames in England can be compared to the United States with 6 of the family names in England being in both their top ten. Many English surnames are also found in Ireland. This is attributable to a number of factors, including the Protestant Plantation of Ireland, as well as the imposition of the Penal Laws in the Middle Ages, which forced many Irish people to Anglicize their surnames. Also, in the 9th century, Viking invaders brought many Norse names to Ireland that they had already brought to England when they established and settled the Danelaw. Although some Scandinavian names may have been brought to England in pre-Viking times, especially in the North and East (who says?). Moreover, the Anglo-Normans who invaded Ireland in the 1170s brought many Norman French names which they had already spread to England.
English place names in the United States.
There are many places in the United States named after places in England as a result of the many English settlers and explorers. These include New York (after the Duke of York), New Hampshire (after Hampshire), New Jersey after the British Crown Dependency of Jersey. Manchester, Boston, Southampton, Gloucester and the region of New England.
In addition, some places were named after the English royal family. The name Virginia was first applied by Queen Elizabeth I (the "Virgin Queen") and Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584., the Carolinas were named after King Charles I and Maryland named so for his wife, Queen Henrietta Maria (Queen Mary) and also Georgia was named after King George II.
Architecture.
Architecture such as the United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C. which was first designed by English-educated American Architect William Thornton. Also, many American college campuses, such as Harvard, Yale, Brown, Williams, Princeton University, and the University of Delaware, have English Georgian or English gothic architecture.
Law.
The American legal system also has its roots in English law. For example, elements of the Magna Carta were incorporated into the United States constitution. English law prior to the revolution is still part of the law of the United States, and provides the basis for many American legal traditions and policies.
After the revolution, English law was again adopted by the now independent American States.
Presidents of English descent.
Most of the Presidents of the United States have had English ancestry. The extent of English Heritage varies in the presidents with earlier presidents being predominantly of colonial English Yankee stock. Later US Presidents' ancestry can often be traced to ancestors from multiple nations in Europe, including England.

United States Senate election in Ohio, 2010

The 2010 United States Senate election in Ohio was held on November 2, 2010, as one of many Ohio elections in 2010. Incumbent two-term Republican U.S. Senator George Voinovich decided to retire instead of seeking a third term. Republican Rob Portman won the open seat.
Democratic primary.
Background.
Congressman Tim Ryan, Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner, and Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher were considered leading contenders to run against George Voinovich. Ohio Governor Ted Strickland urged Jennifer Brunner to run for re-election rather than run for the Senate. Cuyahoga County Commissioner Peter Lawson Jones and Ohio State Representative Tyrone Yates considered running, but both withdrew from consideration.
Campaign.
On February 17, 2009, Brunner and Fisher both officially announced their candidacies for the now-open seat election, with Strickland officially endorsing Fisher. Ryan declined to run and endorsed Fisher in July.
Fisher was endorsed by Governor Ted Strickland and U.S. Representatives John Boccieri, Tim Ryan, Zack Space, and Charlie Wilson.
Polling in late 2009 and January 2010 showed Brunner to be more competitive than Fisher in a general election matchup against Portman, while Fisher and Brunner were deadlocked in Democratic primary polling.
Charlene Renee Bradley and Traci Johnson also filed to run in the Democratic primary.
Republican primary.
Background.
With rumors circulating about Voinovich's possible retirement, former Director of the Office of Management and Budget, United States Trade Representative, and Congressman Rob Portman and State Auditor Mary Taylor were considered the main contenders for the Republican nomination. Former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell was also considered a potential candidate, but declined in order to run for chairman of the Republican National Committee.
Campaign.
When Voinovich made his retirement official, Portman declared his candidacy the next day. Thomas Ganley, a Cleveland car dealer, launched his campaign for the nomination in April, after Portman had collected support from most of the Ohio Republican establishment. Taylor officially declined to run in May and was announced as gubernatorial candidate John Kasich's running mate on January 12, 2010 
Ganley was the only other declared candidate, but on February 17, 2010, he announced that he would switch races and run against Betty Sutton in Ohio's 13th congressional district instead, leaving Portman as the only Republican candidate. He had over $7 million in campaign funds.
General election.
Campaign.
When the incumbent announced he would retire, Portman jumped into the race in early 2009. During the two-year time period, Portman raised over $9 million. Originally, the election was seen as a toss up. His experience as a former Bush official was considered to be a big problem for Portman. Both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden campaigned for Fisher.
Television advertisements were very negative. Fisher attacked Portman for helping to ship jobs overseas during his entire political career, backing deals that shipped jobs overseas, and the trade deficit with China, which grew by over $41 billion. Portman claimed in response that most jobs were being lost to other states, not countries. Portman attacked Fisher for supporting Obama's stimulus and cap and trade.
Debates.
Three debates were held in Cleveland, Columbus, and Toledo. The first one was in Toledo on October 5. The second one was in Cleveland on October 8, while the third was in Columbus on October 12.
Results.
Winning the election, Portman received 57% of the votes. He received the majority of votes in 82 of 88 counties and in 15 of 18 Congressional districts, including the district of liberal U.S. Congressman Dennis Kucinich.

Poster

A poster is any piece of printed paper designed to be attached to a wall or vertical surface. Typically posters include both textual and graphic elements, although a poster may be either wholly graphical or wholly text. Posters are designed to be both eye-catching and informative. Posters may be used for many purposes. They are a frequent tool of advertisers (particularly of events, musicians and films), propagandists, protestors and other groups trying to communicate a message. Posters are also used for reproductions of artwork, particularly famous works, and are generally low-cost compared to original artwork.
History.
Introduction.
According to the French historian Max Gallo, "for over two hundred years, posters have been displayed in public places all over the world. Visually striking, they have been designed to attract the attention of passers-by, making us aware of a political viewpoint, enticing us to attend specific events, or encouraging us to purchase a particular product or service." The modern poster, as we know it, however, dates back to 1870 when the printing industry perfected colour lithography and made mass production possible.
"In little more than a hundred years", writes poster expert John Barnicoat, "it has come to be recognized as a vital art form, attracting artists at every level, from painters like Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha to theatrical and commercial designers." They have ranged in styles from Art Nouveau, Symbolism, Cubism, and Art Deco to the more formal Bauhaus and the often incoherent hippie posters of the 1960s.
Mass production.
Posters, in the form of placards and posted bills, have been used since earliest times, primarily for advertising and announcements. Purely textual posters have a long history: they advertised the plays of Shakespeare and made citizens aware of government proclamations for centuries. However, the great revolution in posters was the development of printing techniques that allowed for cheap mass production and printing, including notably the technique lithography which was invented in 1796 by the German Alois Senefelder. The invention of lithography was soon followed by chromolithography, which allowed for mass editions of posters illustrated in vibrant colours to be printed.
Developing art form.
By the 1890s, the technique had spread throughout Europe. A number of noted French artists created poster art in this period, foremost amongst them Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Ch√©ret, Eug√®ne Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Louis Anguetin, Georges de Feure and Henri-Gabriel Ibels. Ch√©ret is considered to be the "father" of advertisement placards. He was a pencil artist and a scene decorator, who founded a small lithography office in Paris in 1866. He used striking characters, contrast and bright colours, and created over 1000 advertisements, primarily for exhibitions, theatres, and products. The industry soon attracted the service of many aspiring painters who needed a source of revenue to support themselves.
Ch√©ret developed a new lithographic technique that suited better the needs of advertisers: he added a lot more colour which, in conjunction with innovative typography, rendered the poster much more expressive. Not surprisingly, Ch√©ret is said to have introduced sex in advertising or, at least, to have exploited the feminine image as an advertising ploy. In contrast with those previously painted by Toulouse-Lautrec, Ch√©ret's laughing and provocative feminine figures meant a new conception of art as being of service to advertising.
Posters soon transformed the thoroughfares of Paris into the "art galleries of the street." Their commercial success was such that some of the artists were in great demand and theatre stars personally selected their own favorite artist to do the poster for an upcoming performance. The popularity of poster art was such that in 1884 a major exhibition was held in Paris.
Commercial uses.
By the 1890s, poster art had widespread usage in other parts of Europe, advertising everything from bicycles to bullfights. By the end of the 19th century, during an era known as the Belle √âpoque, the standing of the poster as a serious artform was raised even further. Between 1895 and 1900, Jules Ch√©ret created the Ma√Ætres de l'Affiche (Masters of the Poster) series that became not only a commercial success, but is now seen as an important historical publication. Alphonse Mucha and Eug√®ne Grasset were also influential poster designers of this generation, known for their Art Nouveau style and stylized figures, particularly of women. Advertisement posters became a special type of graphic art in the modern age. Poster artists such as Th√©ophile Steinlen, Albert Guillaume, Leonetto Cappiello, Henri Thiriet and others became important figures of their day, their art form transferred to magazines for advertising as well as for social and political commentary.
In the United States, posters did not evolve to the same artistic level. American posters were primarily directed towards basic commercial needs to deliver a written message. However, the advent of the travelling circus brought colourful posters to tell citizens that a carnival was coming to town. But these too were very commercially utilitarian, of average quality, and few saw any real artistic creativity.
Many posters have had great artistic merit and have become extremely collectible. These include the posters advertising World's Fairs and Colonial Exhibitions.
Political uses.
Other times of great turmoil also produced great posters. The 1960s saw the rise of pop art and protest movements throughout the West; both made great use of posters.
Perhaps the most acclaimed posters were those produced by French students during the so-called ""√©v√©nements"" of May 1968. During the 1968 Paris student riots and for years to come, Jim Fitzpatrick's stylized poster of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (based on the photo "Guerrillero Heroico"), also became a common youthful symbol of rebellion.
After the September 11 attacks, public schools across the United States posted "In God We Trust" framed posters in their "libraries, cafeterias and classrooms." The American Family Association supplied several 11-by-14-inch posters to school systems.
Poster printing.
Many printing techniques are used to produce posters. While most posters are mass-produced, posters may also be printed by hand or in limited editions. Most posters are printed on one side and left blank on the back, the better for affixing to a wall or other surface. Pin-up sized posters are usually printed on A3 Standard Silk paper in full colour. Upon purchase, most commercially available posters are often rolled up into a cylindrical tube to allow for damage-free transportation. Rolled-up posters can then be flattened under pressure for several hours to regain their original form.
It is possible to use poster creation software to print large posters on standard home or office printers.
Types of poster designs.
Many posters, particularly early posters, were used for advertising products. Posters continue to be used for this purpose, with posters advertising films, music (both concerts and recorded albums), comic books, and travel destinations being particularly notable examples.
Propaganda and political posters.
During the First and Second World Wars, recruiting posters became extremely common, and many of them have persisted in the national consciousness, such as the "Lord Kitchener Wants You" posters from the United Kingdom, the "Uncle Sam wants you" posters from the United States, or the "Loose Lips Sink Ships" posters that warned of foreign spies. Also in Canada, they were widespread.
Posters during wartime were also used for propaganda purposes, persuasion, and motivation, such as the famous Rosie the Riveter posters which exhorted women workers to work in factories during World War II. The Soviet Union also produced a plethora of propaganda posters, some of which became iconic representations of the Great Patriotic War.
During the democratic revolutions of 1989 in Central and Eastern Europe the poster was very important weapon in the hand of the opposition. Brave printed and hand-made political posters appeared on the Berlin Wall, on the statue of St. Wenseslas in Prague and around the unmarked grave of Imre Nagy in Budapest and the role of them was indispensable for the democratic change. An example of an influential political poster is Shepard Fairey's Barack Obama "HOPE" poster.
Movie posters.
The film industry quickly discovered that vibrantly coloured posters were an easy way to sell their pictures. Today, posters are produced for most major films, and the collecting of movie posters has become a major hobby. The record price for a poster was set on November 15, 2005 when US$690,000 was paid for a poster of Fritz Lang's 1927 film "Metropolis" from the Reel Poster Gallery in London. Other early horror and science fiction posters are known to bring tremendous prices as well, with an example from The Mummy realizing $452,000 in a 1997 Sotheby's auction, and posters from both The Black Cat and Bride of Frankenstein selling for $334,600 in various Heritage Auctions. The 1931 Frankenstein 6-sheet poster, of which only 1 copy is known to exist, is considered to be the most valuable film poster in the world..
Travel posters.
Poster advertising or proposing a travel destination, or simply artistically articulating a place have been made. An example is the Beach Town Posters series, a collection of Art Deco travel posters of American beach resorts that refer to the advertising style of the 1920s and 1930s.
Railway posters.
In the early days of steam railways in Britain, the various rail companies advertised their routes and services on simple printed sheets. By the 1850s, with increasing competition and improvements in printing technology, pictorial designs were being incorporated in their advertising posters. The use of graphic artists began to influence the design of the pictorial poster. In 1905, the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) commissioned Norman Wilkinson to produce artwork for a new landscape poster, advertising their rail/steam packet link to Ireland. In 1908, for the Great Northern Railway (GNR), John Hassall produced the famous image of the "Jolly Fisherman" with the "Skegness is so Bracing" slogan. The development of this commercial art form throughout the first half of the 20th century reflected the changes in British society, along with the changing styles of art, architecture and fashion as well as changing patterns of holidaymaking.
Event posters.
Posters advertising events have become common. Any sort of public event, from a rally to a play, may be advertised with posters; a few types of events have become notable for their poster advertisements.
Boxing posters.
Boxing Posters were used in and around the actual venue to advertise the forthcoming fight, date, ticket prices, and usually consisted of pictures of each boxer. Boxing Posters vary in size and vibrancy, but are not usually smaller than 18x22 inches. In the early days, few boxing posters survived the actual event and have thus become a collectible.
Concert posters.
Many concerts, particularly rock concerts, have custom-designed posters that are used for advertisement of the event. These often become collectors items as well.
Band/music posters.
Posters that showcase a person's favorite artist or music group are popular in teenagers' bedrooms, as well as in college dorm rooms and apartments. Many posters have pictures of popular rock bands and artists.
Blacklight poster.
Blacklight posters are designed to have a special effect under a blacklight (ultraviolet light).
Pin-up posters.
Pinup posters, "pinups," or cheesecake posters are pictures of attractive women designed to be displayed, first coming to popularity in the 1920s. The popularity of sexy pin-up girl posters has been erratic in recent decades. Pin-ups such as Betty Grable and Jane Russell were highly popular with soldiers during World War II but much less so during the Vietnam War. The late 1970s and into the beginning of the 1980s were boom years for large posters of television actresses, especially Farrah Fawcett and Cheryl Tiegs.
Affirmation posters.
This refers to decorative posters that are meant to be motivational and inspirational. One popular series has a black background, a scene from nature, and a word such as "Leadership" or "Opportunity." Another version (usually framed and matted) uses a two-image hologram which changes as the viewer walks past.
Publications.
Book posters.
Books on poster is a type of poster design where the entire text of a book (usually a novel) is printed in legible form. This unique and modern design style is commonly characterized by a wall of text with a depiction of an important element of the book by use of negative space, which in this case is also known as white space.
Comic book posters.
The resurgence of comic book popularity in the 1960s led to the mass production of comic book posters in the 1970s and onward. These posters typically feature popular characters in a variety of action poses. The fact that comic books are a niche market means that a given poster usually has a smaller printing run than other genres of poster. Therefore, older posters may be quite sought after by collectors. Promotional posters are usually distributed folded, whereas retail posters intended for home decoration are rolled.
Educational posters.
Research posters and "poster sessions".
Posters are used in academia to promote and explain research work. They are typically shown during conferences, either as a complement to a talk or scientific paper, or as a publication. They are of lesser importance than actual articles, but they can be a good introduction to a new piece of research before the paper is published. They may be considered as grey literature. Poster presentations are often not peer-reviewed, but can instead be submitted, meaning that as many as can fit will be accepted.
Classroom posters.
Posters are a standard feature of classrooms worldwide. A typical school in North America will display a variety, including: advertising tie-ins (e.g. an historical movie relevant to a current topic of study); alphabet and grammar; numeracy and scientific tables; safety and other instructions; artwork and displays by the students.
Vintage poster restoration/conservation.
The backing of posters with fabric dates back to 19th century France, where posters were occasionally glued to linen for reinforcement. This provided some protection, but with the passage of time the paper continued to become brittle and was frequently torn by stress. Modern backing techniques have eliminated this problem by using an acid free paper between the poster and the fabric. The adhesive used is wheat paste treated to inhibit mold growth.
The principal reason to fabric-back a poster is to provide support for the paper. It also enables the conservator to flatten the folds and to more easily make repairs. Fabric backing also eliminates the waviness that can occur when the poster is framed.
Reversibility is a concept that is important in all conservation work, because today's curators and collectors are only temporary custodians of a cultural object (the poster) that will have continuing and timeless interest for future collectors. We strive to make certain that materials and techniques that are applied to the poster are not harmful over time and are reversible to bring it back to the state in which we found it.
Restoration can dramatically improve the appearance of a poster. Damage caused by clear adhesive tape, residual stains, water marks and dirt can be easily repaired; combining this with the replacement of lost paper can bring the poster back to virtually its original state.

Government Office for Science

The Government Office for Science is part of the British government. This organization advises the UK Government on policy and decision-making based on robust scientific evidence and long-term thinking. It is led by the Government Chief Scientific Adviser (GCSA), Sir Mark Walport who reports to the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
The office is based in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills where it works with other parts of the Department, including the Science and Research Group, which funds research through Research Councils and the Higher Education Funding Council for England.
Networking.
The Government Office for Science works collaboratively, using formal and informal networks, including colleagues in other departments and external experts. Together, they create and promote guidance and frameworks describing how departments can use the natural and social sciences, engineering and medicine to provide a sound evidence base for making policy. The guidance and frameworks encourage and support departments‚Äô use and management of science, as well as challenging them to match best practice across Government and (where appropriate) outside.
Advice.
Government departments each have their own Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA), and CSAs work together on cross-cutting issues. In some cases the GCSA leads in advising the Government on major cross-cutting issues, working with other CSAs. In doing so he engages the best scientists nationally and often internationally to help him and ensure that his advice is as robust as possible.
Foresight.
Much of the Government Office for Science's work looks to the future, focusing on what science and the evidence base can tell us about how the world could develop and what effects potential interventions might have. The Foresight program and its Horizon Scanning Center enable the Government to plan for the long term by providing a view of potential futures under a variety of conditions. Foresight projects address broad policy areas with a strong scientific component such as flooding and infectious diseases, whereas the Horizon Scanning Center conducts smaller projects across the full policy spectrum and increases the Government‚Äôs capability to think about the future systematically. Much of the value of Foresight comes from connecting experts from diverse disciplines and organizations with each other and with policymakers, and facilitating their collaboration to produce credible yet challenging visions of the future.
Foresight Projects.
Foresight projects 
are in-depth and long term studies looking at major issues. Examples are:

Han Solo

Han Solo is a character in the "Star Wars" universe, portrayed by Harrison Ford in the original trilogy. He and his co-pilot Chewbacca become involved in the Rebel Alliance against the Galactic Empire. Over the course of the "Star Wars" franchise, he becomes a chief figure in the Alliance and succeeding galactic governments. "Star Wars" creator George Lucas described the character as "a loner who realizes the importance of being part of a group and helping for the common good".
Appearances.
Original trilogy.
Introduced in "Star Wars" (1977), Han Solo and Chewbacca are indebted to Jabba the Hutt after the loss of valuable cargo. 
On Tatooine, Solo accepts a charter to transport Luke Skywalker, Ben Kenobi, C-3PO and R2-D2 to Alderaan in his "Millennium Falcon" ship for a payment to clear the debt. But when the crew and passengers arrive at the planet's coordinates, they discover that Alderaan has been destroyed by the Death Star, and the "Falcon" is then captured and held within the battle station. Enticed by the likelihood of a large reward, Solo and Chewbacca help Skywalker rescue Princess Leia Organa held captive aboard the station. After delivering Skywalker, Leia and the droids to the Rebel Alliance, Solo and his Wookiee co-pilot receive payment for their services and depart. 
However, Solo has a change of heart and returns to save Luke's life during the film's climactic battle scene, ultimately enabling Luke to destroy the Death Star. For his heroics, Solo is presented with a medal and is appointed a Captain of the Rebel Alliance.
In "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980), Han Solo continues to assist the Rebels against the Empire. 
Han once again risks his life to save Luke Skywalker by braving a snowstorm on the ice planet Hoth to rescue his wounded friend. When the Empire attacks the Rebel base, Solo transports Chewbacca, Leia Organa and C-3PO to Cloud City where his old friend Lando Calrissian (Cloud City's administrator) operates to hide from Imperial agents. When bounty hunter Boba Fett tracks the "Falcon" to Cloud City, Darth Vader forces Calrissian to help capture Solo who is then sealed in carbonite for delivery to Jabba the Hutt. Lando is able to free Vader's other captives but their rescue attempt of Solo fails and Fett is able to escape with Solo's frozen body.
During "Return of the Jedi" (1983), Han Solo is still frozen until Leia Organa and Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker infiltrate Jabba the Hutt's palace and free him but they're caught by Jabba before they can escape. When Jabba orders them to be executed, Solo helps Luke and Leia in defeating Jabba and his henchmen before escaping and defeating Boba Fett. 
Reunited with the Rebels, Solo is commissioned as a General. Along with Leia and Chewbacca, he goes to the forest moon of Endor and leads a team deactivating the force fields protecting the Empire's second Death Star, in which they are aided by the Ewoks while Luke fights the Emperor on the Death Star. At the end of the film, Solo joins the Rebels in celebrating the destruction of the second Death Star and the Empire. At the end, he and Leia declare their love for each other while reuniting with Luke and Lando as well.
Other appearances.
On February 6, 2013, Entertainment Weekly reported that The Walt Disney Company, the new owner of Lucasfilm since 2012, is developing a stand-alone film featuring Han Solo which would take place between "Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith" (2005) and the "Star Wars" (1977). 
2014.
It was also announced that Harrison Ford will reprise his role as Han Solo in the first installment of the upcoming third "Star Wars" trilogy.
Expanded Universe.
Brian Daley wrote a series of novels, the first published in 1979, exploring Han Solo and Chewbecca's smuggling adventures, and Ann C. Crispin's "The Han Solo Trilogy" (1997‚Äì1998) further develops the character's backstory. Crispin's books depict Solo as a beggar and pickpocket throughout much of his youth. He becomes a pilot and, in the process of undermining a religious fraud, falls in love with Bria Tharen, who disappears before Solo joins the Imperial Navy. Solo loses his commission and is cashiered when he refuses an order to skin Chewbacca for commandeering a ship carrying Wookiee children destined for slavery; Chewbacca, in turn, swears a "life-debt" to Solo. The two become smugglers, and help repel an Imperial blockade of a Hutt moon. Solo soon thereafter wins the "Millennium Falcon" from Lando Calrissian in a card tournament. Tharen, now a Rebel agent, reappears and asks for Solo, Chewbacca and Calrissian's help in attacking a slave colony. After succeeding, Tharen's troopers steal the smuggler's valuables to aid the Rebel Alliance. To compensate their losses, Solo and Chewbacca accept a smuggling job from Jabba the Hutt; but Imperial ships force the smugglers to jettison their cargo, invoking the debt Solo and Chewbacca owe the Hutt at the beginning of "Star Wars".
Solo plays a central role in several "Star Wars" stories set after "Return of the Jedi". In "The Courtship of Princess Leia" (1995), he resigns his commission to pursue Leia, whom he eventually marries. Solo and Leia have three children: twins Jaina and Jacen and son Anakin. Chewbacca dies saving Anakin's life in "Vector Prime" (1999), sending Solo into a deep depression. In "Star by Star" (2001), Anakin dies as well, compounding Solo's despair. At the end of the series, however, Solo accepts the deaths of his son and his best friend, and reconciles with his family.
In the "Legacy of the Force" series, Jacen Solo becomes the Sith Lord Darth Caedus and plunges the galaxy into a bloody civil war. Solo disowns Jacen, but is still devastated by each new outrage his son commits. He and Leia adopt Allana (Jacen's daughter) after Jacen's death in the novel "Invincible".
Influence and critical reaction.
Han Solo is a reckless smuggler with a sarcastic wit; he is "a very practical guy" and considers himself "a materialist"; but the adventures in the first "Star Wars" movie evoke his compassion, a trait "he didn't know he possessed".
The American Film Institute ranked Solo as the 14th greatest film hero. He was also deemed the 4th greatest movie character of all-time by "Empire" magazine. "Entertainment Weekly" ranked the character 7th on their list of "The All-Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture". On their list of the "100 Greatest Fictional Characters", Fandomania.com ranked Solo at number 15. IGN listed Han Solo as the second greatest " Star Wars" character of all time (behind Darth Vader), as well as listing him as one of the top 10 characters who most needed a spin-off, saying he was "Arguably the coolest character in the Star Wars universe".
"Prince of Persia" producer Ben Mattes explained that their "inspiration was anything Harrison Ford has ever done: Indiana Jones, Han Solo". The Japanese manga and anime anti-hero Space Adventure Cobra has been compared by reviewers to Solo. In preparing to play James T. Kirk, Chris Pine drew inspiration from Ford's depictions of Han Solo and Indiana Jones, highlighting their humor and "accidental hero" traits.
Merchandising.
Solo has been merchandised in multiple media, including action figures, video games, and other collectibles. A Han Solo action figure with "human proportions" was released in 1977 to coincide with the release of the original Star Wars, while a figure created for the films' mid-1990s re-release was criticized as "unrealistically muscled."

Estelle Getty

Estelle Scher-Gettleman (July 25, 1923 ‚Äì July 22, 2008), better known by her stage name Estelle Getty, was an American actress, who appeared in film, television, and theatre. She was best known for her role as Sophia Petrillo on "The Golden Girls" from 1985 to 1992, which won her an Emmy and a Golden Globe, on "The Golden Palace" from 1992 to 1993 and on "Empty Nest" from 1993 to 1995. In her later years, after retiring from acting, she battled Lewy body dementia.
Early life.
Getty was born Estelle Scher in New York City, the daughter of Sarah and Charles Scher, Jewish immigrants from Poland. They worked in the glass business. She had a sister, Roz, and a brother, David. Getty got her start in the Yiddish theater and also as a comedian in the Catskills borscht belt resorts, and among her most notable stage roles was as Harvey Fierstein's mother in "Torch Song Trilogy" during its original Broadway run.
Career.
Getty is best known for her role as Sophia Petrillo on the popular 1980s sitcom "The Golden Girls". Her character was the wise-cracking Sicilian mother of Dorothy Zbornak, played by Bea Arthur, although Getty was in fact one year younger than Arthur. Getty won an Emmy Award in 1988 for Outstanding Supporting Actress.
During her time on "The Golden Girls", Getty wrote an autobiography with Steve Delsohn entitled "If I Knew Then, What I Know Now... So What?" (Contemporary Books, 1988). She further capitalized on her success by releasing an exercise video for senior citizens in 1993.
Personal life.
Getty attended Seward Park High School.
She was married to Arthur Gettleman (whose name she adapted into her stage name) from December 21, 1947 until his death in 2004. The couple had two sons: Carl Gettleman, who lives in California, and Barry Gettleman, who lives in Florida.
In 1991, as later reported in "Star" magazine, Getty helped to nurse her 29-year-old nephew Steven Scher, who was near death and suffering from the final stages of AIDS. Because Scher's parents lived in England and his friends were no longer able to care for him in Greensboro, North Carolina, Getty had him flown to California and admitted to hospice care. He died in January 1992. Getty was a supporter of gay rights.
In 2000, Getty stopped making public appearances after revealing she had Parkinson's disease and osteoporosis. In 2002, media reports claimed she was also suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Doctors later discovered she actually had Lewy body dementia; both the Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diagnoses were incorrect. Cast members attempted to talk to her on the phone or in person but found that she couldn't remember them, or anything about the show. Bea Arthur said that even during production of the series, Getty had so much trouble remembering her lines that they should have known something was wrong from the beginning.
In 2003, Lifetime television hosted a "Golden Girls" reunion. In 2008, the show was awarded the Pop Culture award at the Sixth Annual TV Land Awards. Getty did not participate in either project.
Getty died on July 22, 2008, just three days before her 85th birthday.

U-101-class submarine

The "U-101" class was a class of nine submarines or U-boats planned for the Austro-Hungarian Navy () during World War I. The class was based on the Type 1916 S 1 design from Ungarische Unterseebotsbau AG. The first three boats were laid down in late 1917 and early 1918 by Austriawerft in Trieste, but none were launched or completed before the end of the war. None of the other six submarines was ever laid down. 
Design.
Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of World War I, and over the first two years of the war the Austro-Hungarian Navy focused its efforts on building a U-boat fleet for local defense within the Adriatic. Beginning in 1916, the Navy began building larger, ocean-going vessels for operation in the wider Mediterranean, outside the Adriatic. With six of the larger submarines under construction, the Navy considered either building German Type UB III submarines under license or implementing the Type 1916 S 1 design submitted by Ungarische Unterseebotsbau AG (UBAG) of Fiume.
The "U-101" class was based on the UBAG design, which called for a boat that displaced surfaced and submerged. The boats were to be long with a beam of and a draft of . For propulsion, the design featured two shafts, with twin diesel engines of (total) for surface running at up to , and twin electric motors of (total) for submerged travel at up to . The "U-101" class boats were designed for a crew of 26 men.
The "U-101" design called for five torpedo tubes‚Äîfour bow tubes and one stern tube‚Äîand a complement of nine torpedoes. The original design specified a single 10¬†cm/35 (3.9¬†in) deck gun supplemented with an machine gun.
Construction.
The Austro-Hungarian Navy authorized a total of nine "U-101"-class submarines, six numbered sequentially from "U-101" to "U-106", and another three, "U-118" to "U-120". Upon completion of the first six "U-101" boats, the Navy intended to scrap its oldest six boats, "U-1" to "U-6", and drop the first two digits from the new boats so that, for example, "U-101" would become the new "U-1". In late 1917 and early 1918 the first three boats, "U-101" to "U-103", were laid down by Austriawerft at Trieste.
The boats were begun late in the war when shortages of skilled shipyard workers and materials were slowing construction of other boats under construction. As a result, none of the first three boats was ever launched, much less completed, and the rest were cancelled before any were laid down. "U-101" was 47% complete at war's end, while "U-102" and "U-103" were only 30% and 10% complete, respectively. Although there is no specific mention of the fates of the three incomplete boats of the "U-101" class, incomplete boats from other late-war classes were scrapped in 1919 and 1920.

On Secret Service

On Secret Service is a 1933 British thriller film directed by Arthur B. Woods and starring Greta Nissen, Karl Ludwig Diehl, Don Alvarado and Austin Trevor. It was produced by British International Pictures, and based on a novel by Robert Baberske.
Plot summary.
In 1912, the Austrian secret service identifies Marcella Galdi, an Italian noblewoman who is visiting Vienna, as an Italian spy. To avoid diplomatic confusions, she is kidnapped while dancing with the Austrian General Staff officer Michael von Hombergk at a ball at the famous hotel Sacher in Vienna, and sent back to Italy. Shortly afterwards, a secret plan of an Austrian fortress appears in Hombergks office desk, and as he himself is unable to explain this, the secret service urges him to commit suicide, but instead he manages to escape from Vienna.
Three years later, Italy and Austria stand against each other in World War I. Von Hombergk has returned to Vienna and asks the secret service for a chance to clean his name from the suspicion of being a spy and a traitor. At least, he is given an Italian uniform and flies to Italy to look for the traitor who put the plans in his office desk three years ago. When landing in Italy, he gets wounded as Italian artillery fires at him, but manages to get out of danger before falling unconscious. When he reaches consciousness again, he is in a military hospital. Here he re-meets Marcella, who is looking for enemy agents and is really shocked when recognising him. As she is in love with him, she offers him the chance to leave Italy as a free man. But to his disappointment she is unwilling to tell him the name of the agent who threw suspicion on his name. Therefore, Hombergk stays in Italy and sets off to Rome as soon as he has got well again. He wants to talk to an antique dealer called Da Villa there who is a faithful Austrian agent. Among Davila's regular customers is also Count Valenti, who is well known as a collector of valuable pictures. At this journey Hombergk meets a dubios Mr Bluenzli, whom he does not consider to be trustworthy. Once he had arrived in Rome, he easily discovers that the traitor he is looking for acts under the code name of K 77. At a meeting with Da Villa, he gets connections to Coronello Ramenelli, chief of the Italian counter-intelligence, who is Marcella Galdis boss and also a friend of Count Valenti. At a dinner party at Ramenellis villa, she and Hombergk re-meet again, and again she does not tell him on. They even spend the night together, but even now Marcella is unwilling to discover him the name of the man who threw suspicion on him. Suddenly Ramenelli appears on the scene. Marcella manages to hide Hombergk, but she cannot avoid him from overhearing that K 77 will arrive soon from Vienna. For her boss does not know the man personally, he orders Marcella to introduce them to each other at a party at Count Valenti's. Hombergk manages to get back to his hotel room without being discovered. When he arrives there, Bluenzli, the man he met on the train to Rome, is waiting for him and tries to blackmail him with the information he has collected about the affair. In a long discussion, Hombergk finally convinces him to work for the Austrian side instead. W√≠th Bluenzlis help, Hombergk arranges to fly the machine which will get "K 77", who has turned out to be a high-ranking Austrian General Staff officer of Italian origin, back to Austria himself. When Marcella gets wind of his plans, she tries to stop him, but is shot dead by Bluenzli shortly before the plane takes off. While Bluenzli is arrested, Hombergk takes off and ‚Äì after a risky flight ‚Äì hands over the traitor to the Austrian authorities. Even though he is re-established now, he cannot forget the loving woman he has lost yet and therefore reports for military service.
Additional information.
The film was first shown to the public on 15 December 1933 in London cinemas. It was a remake of the German movie "Spies at Work" which had had its debut nine months earlier in Berlin. There was also an American version, this one entitled "Secret agent", alternating "Spy 77". In the USA, the film had its debut on 9 February 1936. By this time, the German original had been banned from the screens again by film checkers of the propaganda ministry.

Yazidi

The Yazidi (also Yezidi, : ÿ¶€éÿ≤€åÿØ€å or "√äzid√Æ") are an ethno-religious community, the majority of whom are related to the Kurds, and who represent an ancient religion that is linked to Zoroastrianism and Sufism. They live primarily in the Nineveh Province of northern Iraq. Additional communities in Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, and Syria have been in decline since the 1990s, their members having emigrated to Europe, especially to Germany. Their religion is seen as a highly syncretic complex of local Yezidi beliefs that contains Zoroastrian elements and Islamic Sufi doctrine introduced to the area by Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir in the 12th century. The Yazidi believe in God as creator of the world, which he placed under the care of seven holy beings or angels, the chief of whom is Melek Taus, the Peacock Angel.
Demographics.
Historically, the Yazidi lived primarily in communities in locales that are in present day Iraq, Syria, and Turkey, and also had significant numbers in Armenia and Georgia. However, events since the 20th century have resulted in considerable demographic shift in these areas as well as mass emigration. As a result population estimates are unclear in many regions, and estimates of the size of the total population vary.
The bulk of the Yazidi population lives in Iraq, where they make up an important Iraqi minority community. Estimates of the size of these communities vary significantly, between 70,000 and 500,000. They are particularly concentrated in northern Iraq in the Nineveh Province. The two biggest communities are in Shekhan, northeast of Mosul, and in Sinjar, at the Syrian border 80 kilometers west of Mosul. In Shekhan is the shrine of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir at Lalish. During the 20th century the Shekhan community struggled for dominance with the more conservative Sinjar community. The demographic profile is likely to have changed considerably since the start of the Iraq War in 2003 and the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime.
Yazidi in Syria live primarily in two communities, one in the Al-Jazira area and the other in the Kurd-Dagh. Population numbers for the Syrian Yazidi community are unclear. In 1963 the community was estimated at about 10,000, according to the national census, but numbers for 1987 were unavailable. There may be between about 12,000 and 15,000 Yazidi in Syria today, though more than half of the community may have emigrated from Syria since the 1980s. Estimates are further complicated by the arrival of as many as 50,000 Yazidi refugees from Iraq during the Iraq War.
The Turkish Yazidi community declined precipitously during the 20th century. By 1982 it had decreased to about 30,000, and in 2009 there were fewer than 500. Most Turkish Yazidi have emigrated to Europe, particularly Germany; those who remain reside primarily in their former heartland of Tur Abdin. Population estimates for the communities in Georgia and Armenia vary, but they too have declined severely. In Georgia the community fell from around 30,000 people to fewer than 5,000 during the 1990s. The numbers in Armenia may have been somewhat more stable; there may be around 40,000 Yazidi still in Armenia. Most Georgian and Armenian Yazidi have relocated to Russia, which recorded a population of 31,273 Yazidis in the 2002 census.
This mass emigration has resulted in the establishment of large diaspora communities abroad. The most significant of these is in Germany, which now has a Yazidi community of over 40,000. Most are from Turkey and more recently Iraq, and live in the western states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony. Since 2008 Sweden has seen sizable growth in its Yazidi emigrant community, which had grown to around 4,000 by 2010, and a smaller community exists in the Netherlands. Other diaspora groups live in Belgium, Denmark, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Australia; these have a total population of probably less than 5,000.
Origins.
The Yazidi are mostly Kurdish-speaking people who adhere to a branch of Iranian religions that blends elements of Mithraism, pre-Islamic Mesopotamian/Assyrian religious traditions, Christianity and Islam. In addition to Kurdish, there are significant Yazidi communities who speak Arabic as their native language. Their principal holy site is in Lalish, northeast of Mosul. The Yazidis' own name for themselves is "√äzid√Æ" or "√äz√Æd√Æ" or, in some areas, "Dasin√Æ" (the latter, strictly speaking, is a tribal name). Some scholars have derived the name Yazidi from Old Iranian "yazata" (divine being), but most say it is a derivation from Umayyad Caliph Yazid I (Yazid bin Muawiyah), revered by the Yazidis as an incarnation of the divine figure Sultan Ezi. Yazidis, themselves, believe that their name is derived from the word "Yezdan" or "√äzid" "God". The Yazidis' cultural practices are observably in Kurdish, and almost all speak Kurmanj√Æ with the exception of the villages of Bashiqa and Bahazane, where Arabic is spoken. Kurmanj√Æ is the language of almost all the orally transmitted religious traditions of the Yazidis.
The religion of the Yazidis is a highly syncretic one: Sufi influence and imagery can be seen in their religious vocabulary, especially in the terminology of their esoteric literature, but much of the mythology is non-Islamic. Their cosmogonies apparently have many points in common with those of ancient Persian religions. Early writers attempted to describe Yazidi origins, broadly speaking, in terms of Islam, or Persian, or sometimes even pagan religions; however, publications since the 1990s have shown such an approach to be overly simplistic.
The origin of the Yazidi religion is now usually seen by scholars as a complex process of syncretism, whereby the belief system and practices of a local faith had a profound influence on the religiosity of adherents of the 'Adawiyya Sufi order living in the Yezidi mountains, and caused it to deviate from Islamic norms relatively soon after the death of its founder, Shaykh 'Adƒ´ ibn Musafir (Yezidish "≈û√™x Ad√Æ"), who is said to be of Umayyad descent. He settled in the valley of Lali≈ü (some thirty-six miles north-east of Mosul) in the early 12th century. ≈û√™x Ad√Æ himself, a figure of undoubted orthodoxy, enjoyed widespread influence. He died in 1162, and his tomb at Lali≈ü is a focal point of Yazidi pilgrimage.
According to the Yezidi calendar, April 2012 marked the beginning of their year 6,762 (thereby year 1 would have been in 4,750 BC in the Gregorian calendar).
During the fourteenth century, important Yezidi tribes whose sphere of influence stretched well into what is now Turkey (including, for a period, the rulers of the principality of Jazira) are cited in historical sources as Yazidi.
According to Mo·∏•ammed A≈°-≈†ahrastani, "The Yezidis are the followers of Yez√Æd bn Unaisa, who that he kept friendship with the first Muhakkama before the Azari·∏≥a" "It is clear, then, that A≈°-≈†ahrastani finds the religious origin of this interesting people in the person of Yez√Æd bn Unaisa. ... We are to understand, therefore, that to the knowledge of the writer, bn Unaisa is the founder of the Yezidi sect, which took its name from him." "Now, the first Muhakkamah is an appellative applied to the Muslim schismatics called Al-·∏™awarij. ... According to this it might be inferred that the Yezidis were originally a ·∏™arijite sub-sect." "Yezid moreover, is said to have been in sympathy with Al-Aba·∏çiyah, a sect founded by 'Abd-Allah Ibn Iba·∏ç."; and the Iba·∏çi sect is another ·∏™arijite sub-sect.
Religious beliefs.
Yazidis are monotheists, believing in one God, who created the world and entrusted it into the care of a "Heptad" of seven Holy Beings, often known as Angels or "heft sirr" (the Seven Mysteries). Preeminent among these is Taw√ªs√™ Melek (frequently known as "Melek Taus" in English publications), the Peacock Angel.
Yazidism is not an off-shoot of another religion (such as Christianity or Islam), but shows influence from the many religions of the middle-east. Core Yazidi cosmology has a pre-Zoroastrian Iranian origin, but Yazidism also includes elements of ancient nature-worship, as well as influences from Christianity, Gnosticism, Zoroastrianism, Islam and Judaism. The heptad of angels are God's emanations which are formed of the light of God. God delegates most of his action to the heptad and is therefore somewhat deistic in nature.
According to the "Encyclopedia of the Orient",
Taw√ªs√™ Melek is often identified by Muslims and Christians with Shaitan (Satan). Yazidis, however, believe Taw√ªs√™ Melek is not a source of evil or wickedness. They consider him to be the leader of the archangels, not a fallen angel. They are forbidden from speaking the name Shaitan. They also hold that the source of evil is in the heart and spirit of humans themselves, not in Taw√ªs√™ Melek. The active forces in their religion are Taw√ªs√™ Melek and Sheik Ad√Æ.
The "Kit√™ba Cilwe" "Book of Illumination", which claims to be the words of Taw√ªs√™ Melek, and which presumably represents Yazidi belief, states that he allocates responsibilities, blessings and misfortunes as he sees fit and that it is not for the race of Adam to question him. Sheikh Ad√Æ believed that the spirit of Taw√ªs√™ Melek was the same as his own, perhaps as a reincarnation. He is reported to have said:Yazidi accounts of creation differ from that of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. They believe that God first created Taw√ªs√™ Melek from his own illumination ("Ronah√Æ") and the other six archangels were created later. God ordered Taw√ªs√™ Melek not to bow to other beings. Then God created the other archangels and ordered them to bring him dust ("Ax") from the Earth ("Erd") and build the body of Adam. Then God gave life to Adam from his own breath and instructed all archangels to bow to Adam. The archangels obeyed except for Taw√ªs√™ Melek. In answer to God, Taw√ªs√™ Melek replied, "How can I submit to another being! I am from your illumination while Adam is made of dust." Then God praised him and made him the leader of all angels and his deputy on the Earth. (This likely furthers what some see as a connection to the Islamic "Shaytan", as according to the Quran he too refused to bow to Adam at God's command, though in this case it is seen as being a sign of Shaytan's sinful pride.) Hence the Yazidis believe that Taw√ªs√™ Melek is the representative of God on the face of the Earth, and comes down to the Earth on the first Wednesday of Nisan (April). Yazidis hold that God created Taw√ªs√™ Melek on this day, and celebrate it as New Year's Day. Yazidis argue that the order to bow to Adam was only a test for Taw√ªs√™ Melek, since if God commands anything then it must happen. ("Bibe, dibe"). In other words, God could have made him submit to Adam, but gave Taw√ªs√™ Melek the choice as a test. They believe that their respect and praise for Taw√ªs√™ Melek is a way to acknowledge his majestic and sublime nature. This idea is called "Knowledge of the Sublime" ("Zanista Ciwaniy√™"). ≈û√™x Ad√Æ has observed the story of Taw√ªs√™ Melek and believed in him.
One of the key creation beliefs held by Yazidis is that they are the descendants of Adam through his son Shehid bin Jer rather than Eve. Yazidis believe that good and evil both exist in the mind and spirit of human beings. It depends on the humans, themselves, as to which they choose. In this process, their devotion to Taw√ªs√™ Melek is essential, since it was he who was given the same choice between good and evil by God, and chose the good.
The Yazidi holy books are claimed to be the "Kit√™ba Cilwe" (Book of Revelation) and the "Mishefa Re≈ü" (Black Book). However, scholars generally agree that the manuscripts of both books published in 1911 and 1913 were forgeries written by non-Yazidis in response to Western travelers' and scholars' interest in the Yazidi religion; the material in them is consistent with authentic Yezidi traditions, however. True texts of those names may have existed, but remain obscure. The real core texts of the religion that exist today are the hymns known as qawls; they have also been orally transmitted during most of their history, but are now being collected with the assent of the community, effectively transforming Yazidism into a scriptural religion. The qawls are full of cryptic allusions and usually need to be accompanied by "ƒçir≈çks" or 'stories' that explain their context.
Two key and interrelated features of Yazidism are: a) a preoccupation with religious purity and b) a belief in metempsychosis. The first of these is expressed in the system of caste, the food laws, the traditional preferences for living in Yazidi communities, and the variety of taboos governing many aspects of life. The second is crucial; Yazidis traditionally believe that the Seven Holy Beings are periodically reincarnated in human form, called a "koasasa".
A belief in the reincarnation of lesser Yazidi souls also exists. Like the Ahl-e Haqq, the Yazidis use the metaphor of a change of garment to describe the process, which they call "kiras guhor√Æn" in Yezidish (changing the garment). Alongside this, Yazidi mythology also includes descriptions of heaven and hell, with hell extinguished, and other traditions incorporating these ideas into a belief system that includes reincarnation.
Organization.
Yazidi society is hierarchical. The secular leader is a hereditary emir or prince, whereas a chief sheikh heads the religious hierarchy. The Yazidi are strictly endogamous; members of the three Yazidi castes, the murids, sheikhs and pirs, marry only within their group, marriage outside the caste is considered as sin punishable by death to restore lost honour.
Religious practices.
Prayers.
Yazidis have five daily prayers: Worshipers should turn their face toward the sun, and for the noon prayer, they should face toward Lali≈ü. Such prayer should be accompanied by certain gestures, including kissing the rounded neck ("ger√Ævan") of the sacred shirt ("kiras"). The daily prayer services must not be performed in the presence of outsiders, and are always performed in the direction of the sun. Wednesday is the holy day but Saturday is the day of rest. There is also a three-day fast in December.
Festivals.
The Yazidi New Year falls in Spring (somewhat later than the Equinox). There is some lamentation by women in the cemeteries, to the accompaniment of the music of the "Qewals", but the festival is generally characterized by joyous events: the music of "dehol" (drum) and "zorna" (shawm), communal dancing and meals, the decorating of eggs.
Similarly, the village Tawaf, a festival held in the spring in honor of the patron of the local shrine, has secular music, dance and meals in addition to the performance of sacred music.
Another important festival is the "Taw√ªsgeran" (circulation of the peacock) where Qewals and other religious dignitaries visit Yazidi villages, bringing the "senjaq", sacred images of a peacock made from brass symbolising Taw√ªs√™ Melek. These are venerated, taxes are collected from the pious, sermons are preached and holy water distributed.
The greatest festival of the year for ordinary Yazidis is the "Cejna Cemaiya" "Feast of the Assembly" at Lalish, a seven-day occasion. A focus of widespread pilgrimage, this is an important time for social contact and affirmation of identity. The religious center of the event is the belief in an annual gathering of the "Heptad" in the holy place at this time. Rituals practiced include the sacrifice of a bull at the shrine of ≈û√™x Shams and the practice of "sema".
Pilgrimage.
The most important ritual is the annual seven-day pilgrimage to the tomb of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir (≈û√™x Ad√Æ) in Lalish, north of Mosul, Iraq. A sacred microcosm of the world, as it were, it contains not only many shrines dedicated to the "koasasa", but a number of other landmarks corresponding to other sites or symbols of significance in other faiths, including "Pirra selat" "Serat Bridge" and a mountain called Mt. Arafat. The two sacred springs are called Zamzam and "Kaniya Sip√Æ" "The White Spring".
If possible, Yazidis make at least one pilgrimage to Lali≈ü during their lifetime, and those living in the region try to attend at least once a year for the autumn "Feast of the Assembly" which is celebrated from 23 Ayl≈´l (September) to 1 Tashrƒ´n (October). During the celebration, Yazidi bathe in the river, wash figures of Taw√ªs√™ Melek and light hundreds of lamps in the tombs of ≈û√™x Ad√Æ and other saints. They also sacrifice an ox, which is one reason they have been connected to Mithraism, in addition to the presence of the dog and serpent in their iconography. The sacrifice of the ox is meant to declare the arrival of fall and to ask for precipitation during winter in order to bring back life to the Earth in the next spring. Moreover, in astrology, the ox is the symbol of Tashrƒ´n.
Purity and taboos.
The Yazidis' concern with religious purity, and their reluctance to mix elements perceived to be incompatible, is shown not only in their caste system, but also in various taboos affecting everyday life. Some of these, such as those on exogamy or on insulting or offending men of religion, are widely respected. Others are often ignored when men of religion are not present. Others still are less widely known and may be localized.
The purity of the four elements Earth, Air, Fire and Water is protected by a number of taboos, e.g. against spitting on earth, water or fire. Some discourage spitting or pouring hot water on the ground because they believe that spirits or souls that may be present would be harmed or offended by such actions if they happen to be hit by the discarded liquid. These may also reflect ancient Iranian preoccupations, as apparently do taboos concerning bodily waste, hair and menstrual blood.
Too much contact with non-Yazidis is also considered polluting. In the past, Yazidis avoided military service which would have led them to live among Muslims, and were forbidden to share such items as cups or razors with outsiders. A resemblance to the external ear may lie behind the taboo against eating head lettuce, whose name "koas" resembles Yezidi pronunciations of "koasasa". Additionally, lettuce grown near Mosul is thought by some Yazidi to be fertilized with human waste, which may contribute to the idea that it is unsuitable for consumption. However, in a BBC interview in April 2010, a senior Yazidi authority stated that ordinary Yazidis may eat what they want, but holy men refrain from certain vegetables (including cabbage) because "they cause gases".
Yazidis refrain from wearing the colour blue (or possibly green as stated in "Soldier Poet and Rebel" by Miles Hudson). The origins of this prohibition are unknown, but may either be because blue represents Noah's flood, or it was possibly the colour worn by a conquering king sometime in the past. Alternatively, the prohibition may arise from their veneration of the Peacock Angel and an unwillingness to usurp His colour.
Customs.
Children are baptized at birth and circumcision is common but not required. Dead are buried in conical tombs immediately after death and buried with hands crossed.
Yazidi are dominantly monogamous but chiefs may be polygamous, having more than one wife. Yazidi are exclusively endogamous; clans do not intermarry even with other Kurds and accept no converts. They claim they are descended only from Adam and not from Eve.
A severe punishment is expulsion, which is also effectively excommunication because the soul of the exiled is forfeit.
In 2007, an incidence of honour killing‚Äîthe stoning of Du'a Khalil Aswad‚Äîmade world headlines.
Myths.
The tale of the Yazidis' origin found in the Black Book gives them a distinctive ancestry and expresses their feeling of difference from other races. Before the roles of the sexes were determined, Adam and Eve quarreled about which of them provided the creative element in the begetting of children. Each stored their seed in a jar which was then sealed. When Eve's was opened it was full of insects and other unpleasant creatures, but inside Adam's jar was a beautiful boychild. This lovely child, known as "son of Jar" grew up to marry a houri and became the ancestor of the Yazidis. Therefore, the Yazidi are regarded as descending from Adam alone, while other humans are descendants of both Adam and Eve.
In other cultures.
Muslim antipathy.
As a demiurge figure, Taw√ªs√™ Melek is often identified by orthodox Muslims as a Shaitan (Satan), a Muslim term denoting a devil or demon who deceives true believers. The Islamic tradition regarding the fall of "Shaitan" from Grace is in fact very similar to the Yazidi story of Malek Taus ‚Äì that is, the Jinn who refused to submit to God by bowing to Adam is celebrated as Taw√ªs√™ Melek by Yazidis, but the Islamic version of the same story curses the same Jinn who refused to submit as becoming Satan. Thus, the Yazidi have been accused of devil worship. Because of this and due to their pre-Islamic beliefs, they have been oppressed by their Muslim neighbors. Treatment of Yazidis was exceptionally harsh during the rule of the Ottoman Empire during the 18th and the first half of 19th century and their numbers dwindled under Ottoman rule both in Syria and Iraq. Massacres at the hand of Ottoman Turks and Muslim Kurdish princes almost wiped out their community in the 19th century. Several punitive expeditions were organized against the Yazidis by the Turkish governors (WƒÅli) of Diyarbakir, Mosul and Baghdad. These operations were legitimized by fatƒÅwa from Islamic clerics. The objective of these persecutions was the forced conversion of Yazidis to the Sunni Hanafi Islam of the Turkish Ottoman Empire.
Recent controversies.
In 2007, a group of around 200 Yazidis beat and stoned to death a 17-year-old Yazidi girl named Du'a Khalil Aswad for falling in love with a Muslim boy. On April 23, 2007 masked gunmen abducted and shot 23 Yazidis near Mosul; this was speculated to be a reprisal attack for Aswad's death.
On August 14, 2007, some 500 Yazidis were killed in a coordinated series of bombings that became the deadliest suicide attack since the Iraq War began.
On August 13, 2009, at least 20 people were killed and 30 wounded in a double suicide bombing in northern Iraq, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. Two suicide bombers with explosive vests carried out the attack at a cafe in Sinjar, a town west of Mosul. In Sinjar, many townspeople are members of the Yazidi minority.
In Europe.
Feleknas Uca, a Yezidi Member of the European Parliament for Germany's Party of Democratic Socialism, was the world's only Yazidi parliamentarian until the Iraqi legislature was elected in 2005. European Yazidis have contributed to the academic community, such as Khalil Rashow in Germany and Jalile Jalil in Austria.
In May 2012, five members of a Yazidi family living in Detmold, Germany, were convicted for having murdered their sister in a so-called "honour killing" and sentenced to terms ranging from five-and-a-half years to life in prison. The victim was 18-year-old Arzu √ñzmen (also spelled Ozmen outside Germany), who fell in love with a German journeymen baker and ran away from her family, violating the exogamy taboo. In November 2011, her siblings abducted her and brother Osman killed her with two shots in the head.
In Western theological references.
As the Yazidi hold religious beliefs that are mostly unfamiliar to outsiders, many non-Yazidi people have written about them and ascribed facts to their beliefs that have dubious historical validity. For example, horror writer H. P. Lovecraft made a reference to the Yezidi as the "last survivors of the Persian devil-worshippers" in his short story "The Horror at Red Hook".
The Yazidis, perhaps because of their secrecy, also have a place in modern occultism. G. I. Gurdjieff wrote about his encounters with the Yazidis several times in his book "Meetings with Remarkable Men", mentioning that they are considered to be "devil worshippers" by other ethnicities in the region.
The Theosophical Society, in its electronic version of the "Encyclopedic Theosophical Glossary" states:
Idries Shah, writing under the pen-name "Arkon Daraul", in the 1961 book "Secret Societies Yesterday and Today", describes discovering a Yazidi-influenced secret society in the London suburbs called the "Order of the Peacock Angel." Idries Shah claimed that Taw√ªs√™ Melek could be understood, from the Sufi viewpoint, as an allegory of the higher powers in humanity.
In Western literature.
In H.P. Lovecraft's story "The Horror at Red Hook", some of the murderous foreigners are identified as belonging to "the Yezidi clan of devil-worshippers".
In her memoir of her service with an intelligence unit of the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division in Iraq during 2003 and 2004, Kayla Williams (2005) records being stationed in northern Iraq near the Syrian border in an area inhabited by "Yezidis". The Yezidis were Yezidi-speaking, but did not consider themselves Kurds, and expressed to Williams a fondness for America and Israel. She was able to learn only a little about the nature of their religion: she thought it very ancient, and concerned with angels. She describes a mountain-top Yezidi shrine as "a small rock building with objects dangling from the ceiling", and alcoves for the placement of offerings. She reports that local Muslims considered the Yezidis to be devil worshippers.
In an October 2006 article in "The New Republic", Lawrence F. Kaplan echoes Williams's sentiments about the enthusiasm of the Yazidis for the American occupation of Iraq, in part because the Americans protect them from oppression by militant Muslims and the nearby Kurds. Kaplan notes that the peace and calm of Sinjar is virtually unique in Iraq: "Parents and children line the streets when U.S. patrols pass by, while Yazidi clerics pray for the welfare of U.S. forces."
A fictional Yazidi character of note is the super-powered police officer King Peacock of the "Top 10" series (and related comics). He is portrayed as a kind, peaceful character with a broad knowledge of religion and mythology. He is depicted as conservative, ethical, and highly principled in family life. An incredibly powerful martial artist, he is able to destroy matter, a power that he claims is derived from communicating with Malek Ta'us.

Cox was in 1964 admitted to Rollins College, a liberal arts college in central Florida. He was the first African-American student admitted to the college, during a period when civil rights and racism were increasingly prominent issues in the southern United States and educational reform was beginning to enshrine the rights of African-American people to participate equally in the education system. At Rollins, Cox saw himself as a pioneer, beginning a new chapter in the history of the school, which was founded in 1885. Cox took a three-year break from Rollins in 1966, returning in 1969.
Cox is the son of a doctor who helped advance the Florida Southern Hospital to the top two out of fifteen in the Central Florida area. His mother, head of Economic Opportunity, Inc., ran 14 preschools for children from underprivileged backgrounds. Cox had three younger siblings, all of whom attended school: his brother Alfred enrolled in Columbia Union College (now Washington Adventist University). Edith and Elaine were much younger than their brothers. After leaving Rollins, Cox established a family of his own.
Cox advocated for civil rights, and in 1971 made an address to a crowd on how happy he was to see formerly impossible developments become reality.

Boxer TV A/S

Boxer TV A/S is a company that is broadcasting pay television channels on the digital terrestrial television network in Denmark since February 1, 2009. It is a subsidiary of Boxer TV Access, a Swedish company which is owned by Teracom which in turn is owned by the Swedish state.
History.
Boxer won the right to build four multiplex networks to broadcast digital television in 2008. They were competing against "Danmarks Digital TV A/S" (owned by Telenor) and "Danmarks TV A/S" (owned by Modern Times Group, MTG). The procurement was organized by the government agency "Mediesekretariatet" and in March 2008 Radio- og TV-n√¶vnet chose Swedish Boxer as the gatekeeper out of the three applicants. 
As Telenor and MTG both owned satellite platforms in Denmark, and Boxer didn't have any operations in Denmark, Boxer won the contract. Boxer stated in their application that they would use three of the networks to broadcast 29 pay television channels and the fourth network would be used to broadcast mobile television.
The initial plan was that Boxer would start broadcasting on November 1, 2009, when the analogue signals were shut down.
Boxer were however able to make a soft launch on Jutland and Western Funen on February 1, 2009. The launch package, which is called "Boxer Vest", consists of TV 2 Zulu, TV 2 News, TV 2 Film, TV 2 Charlie, Kanal 4, Kanal 5, 6'eren, Discovery Channel and Animal Planet.
Starting on May 1, 2009, Boxer made a soft launch in Copenhagen. This was made possible by using the Copenhagen transmitter on UHF channel 35 which was used to broadcast local channels such as Kanal K√∏benhavn. Boxer broadcasts the same channels as in Jutland, but shares the frequency with Kanal K√∏benhavn and the gaming channel G-TV.
In months leading up to the full launch, Boxer announced agreement with the channels that were added in November 2009, including Discovery Travel & Living, CNN and Cartoon Network in February, Disney Channel in April, Travel Channel in May, Disney XD, Discovery Science, MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon in June, Canal 9 and Canal+ channels in July and TV 2 Sport in August. On August 17, Boxer revealed the full lineup. Other than the previously announced channels, it would include The Voice, History, Star!, Body In Balance, TV4 Sweden, TV2 Norway and Das Erste.
Notably absent from the lineup were the Viasat channels (including TV3, TV3+ and TV3 Puls), Eurosport, dk4, National Geographic Channel and SVT's channels.
On March 15, 2011 there was a channel change, and Body In Balance and Canal+ Sport 1 was cut from the package and replaced by DK4 which had been in great demand. Also Canal+ Hits Sport Weekend was replaced by just Canal+ Hits.
11 January 2012 there an additional another channel change took place, since the Danish TV 2 became a pay channel. today the channel is offered in all Boxer channel packets such as Boxer Mini, Boxer Mix, Boxer Max, Boxer Flex8 and the Boxer TV 2 package.
from April 2012, Boxer has offered HD channels. As of today Boxer offers seven HD channels such as TV2 HD, TV2 Film HD,TV2 Fri HD, TV3 HD, TV3 Sport HD, HD 5 and HD 6 as well as the existing DR HD channels, which are an integrated part of any Boxer package.
Boxer has continued to adjust their range of channels and some channels have been added such as TV3 and TV3 Plus while others and less popular have been removed.
For more on the parent company, Boxer TV Access, see the article Boxer TV Access.
Products.
It is possible to choose between five channel packages at Boxer and supplement with any of the "tilvalgskanaler"
Boxer are obligated to offer highly flexible packages. This means that, aside from the regular tiers Boxer Mini (7 channels), Boxer Mix (15 channels), Boxer Max (29 channels) and Boxer TV2 pakken (all of TV2's channels), similar to the ones offered by other operators, Boxer also offers Flex8, where the consumer can choose eight channels from a list of 27, as well as eight themed packages and several channels that can be bought √† la carte.
Boxer offers the service "Boxer Bio", which is a film and TV-show streaming service which also allows the viewers to record the broadcasts. You need to have the Boxer Bio Box in order to receive the service.
Since 2011 Boxer also offers pre pay "Tank Selv Kort", which is not considered as common subscribing. This card has no real contract or guarantees, but unlocks about 25 channels within Danish broadcasting range, including the area of Danish television overspill. The card is payable though a website link and it's possible to refill the card for 1,2 or 3 months. First month is included in the price of the card, it must only be activated prior to use. This pre-pay card is a slightly more expensive way of watching payment channels compared with common subscription, and addition of other channels are impossible. But for Danish speaking people in e.g. the German Flensburg (which was Danish until 1864, and still has a large Danish speaking population) it's the only option to watch Danish channels that not are free-to-air. The same apply to costumers with official debts and who due to that fact gets declined a subscription. The card is also known to have some users in southern and western Sweden, primary in the ex-Danish province of Scania.
Channels.
Note conc. TV2-Sport and the pre pay card "Tank Selv Kort" - when activating the card a question "Do You want TV2 Sport ?" appears. If the user wants this channel, then the user has to fill in name, address, e-mail, phone etc. (Otherwise he/she can remain anynomus). However if TV2 Sport is fully included in the "Tank Selv Kort" card is not certain. The channel is not mentioned in advertising or information, so it appears that Boxer may lock TV2 Sport again whenever they want.
Apart from the five multiplex of Boxer, there exists in the Copenhagen metropolitan area a sixth one called MUX-CPH. This multiplex is both unconnected to Boxer and their four channels are broadcast free-to-air from one single transmitter in the north-west of Copenhagen. Yet, in the flat landscape receiving is possible up to a range of 30 to 40¬†km (possibly even longer) depending of the antenna and local surroundings. The four channels are

John Simpson (boxer)

John Simpson (born 26 July 1983 in Greenock, Scotland), is a professional boxer. He is a featherweight, and former British Featherweight Champion. He is also the Former Commonwealth champion.
Professional career.
Simpson's professional boxing career began in September 2002, with a first-round knockout of Simon Chambers. Simpson suffered a setback when he lost his second fight on points against Lee Holmes. Simpson remained undefeated in his next ten fights, and a victory over Marc Callaghan led to him receiving a shot at the British featherweight title.
British title challenges.
On 5 November 2004, Simpson faced Dazzo Williams in a challenge for the British featherweight title. Simpson lost a very close points decision as referee Phil Edwards scored the bout 115-114 in favour of Williams. After a six month lay off, Simpson returned to the ring to defeat former European lightweight title challenger Dariusz Snarski via a third-round knockout.
On 5 November 2005, exactly one-year after his last title challenge, Simpson fought Andy Morris for the vacant British featherweight title. Simpson was defeated by a unanimous decision with scores of 118-111, 117-111 and 118-110. Following this fight, Simpson lost to Stephen Foster Jr. via a unanimous points decision in a challenge for the WBU featherweight title.
On 9 December 2006, Simpson fought Andy Morris in his third challenge for the British featherweight title. Simpson claimed the title after stopping Morris in the 5th round. The fight was stopped after referee John Keane deemed that a cut over Morris' left eye was too severe to allow the fight to continue. Morris' trainer Bob Shannon has argued that his fighter should have been allowed to continue.
WBU title.
On 10 March 2007, Simpson lost a controversial points decision to Derry Mathews in a contest for the WBU featherweight title. Matthews was floored in the first round before Simpson was badly cut by an accidental headbutt. Mathews went on to be deducted points in the 6th and 9th rounds for hitting behind the head and holding. Despite the deductions and the knockdown, Mathews was awarded a wide points decision with scores of 118-112, 117-110 and 113-111. It was later announced that two of the ringside judges had failed to deduct the two points Mathews lost from their scorecards.
British title defences.
On 6 August 2007, Simpson defended his British featherweight title with a fifth-round knockout of Ryan Barrett.
On 7 September 2007, Simpson fought Andy Morris for a third time and defeated him via a seventh-round knockout to defend his British title. After the fight, Simpson said "I hope I can go on to bigger and better things now. Hopefully now I can go on to European and World titles, I started boxing to win a World title and that is my ambition". 
On 6 June 2008, Simpson lost his British featherweight title to Paul Appleby in a close unanimous points decision.
On 28 November 2008, Simpson returned to the ring to defeat Kenyan John Gicharu on points over 8 rounds.
Commonwealth Champion.
On 16 January 2009, Simpson travelled to Middlesbrough to meet Paul Truscott for Truscott's Commonwealth featherweight Championship. The fight ended in victory for Simpson following a clash of heads which caused the fight to be stopped on cuts in the 8th round. On 4 September 2009 Simpson made his first defence against the man he had beaten for the title. The fight once again took place in Middlesbrough and saw the Scotsman retain his title this time stopping Truscott in the 10th round with both fighters contesting a furiously paced bout.

Zoia Horn

Zoia Horn (born 1918 in Odessa, Ukraine) is an American librarian who is considered to be the first librarian ever to be jailed for refusing to divulge information that violated her belief in intellectual freedom. Horn, an outspoken member of the American Library Association's Intellectual Freedom Committee, worked at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania in the early 1970s. Horn was jailed for nearly three weeks for contempt after refusing to testify for the prosecution in the 1972 conspiracy trial of the "Harrisburg Seven" anti-war activists.
Early life.
Horn was born in Odessa, Ukraine in 1918, to a secular Jewish family of small businessmen and shopkeepers. She emigrated with her family to Canada in 1926 at the age of 8, then to New York City where she attended Brooklyn College and the Pratt Institute Library School. She first began working at a library in 1942.
In 1964, she won a Humanities Fellowship to the University of Oregon where she became active in librarians‚Äô organizations and conferences. She began working at the UCLA library in 1965, where she participated in daily vigils protesting the Vietnam War. She later recalled that she attended the protests "always wearing good shoes and gloves, the proper lady-librarian," hoping to show that war protestors were "ordinary folks." In 1968, she was hired as Head of the Reference Department at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, where she continued to work with peace activists.
Harrisburg Seven trial.
In January 1971, Horn was contacted by the FBI, seeking evidence involving Phillip Berrigan. Berrigan, a Roman Catholic priest and anti-war activist, was serving a sentence in a nearby federal prison for burning draft files concerning the Vietnam War. Berrigan, from his jail cell, was alleged to be plotting along with six other individuals (Harrisburg Seven), to blow up heating tunnels beneath Washington, D.C., and to kidnap Henry Kissinger, the national security adviser to President Richard Nixon.
A prisoner, Boyd Douglas in Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary on a work/study program who also worked at the Bucknell library relayed letters, allegedly including anti-war plot details and love letters, from fellow anti-war activists, including Sister Liz McAlistair, to Berrigan in prison. Horn and an other library employee at Bucknell testified before a grand jury. During the trial, they were subpoenaed to testify for the prosecution, but Horn refused to testify at the trial on the grounds that her forced testimony would threaten intellectual and academic freedom. Horn served 20 days in Dauphin County Jail, but was released after the prosecution's case was found unreliable. At the time, the "Los Angeles Times" published a UPI photograph of Horn being taken from the courthouse in handcuffs and reported: "Mrs. Zoia Horn Galloway, a former Bucknell University librarian, was jailed for contempt ... after refusing to testify despite being granted immunity."
Horn was jailed for almost three weeks "for refusing to testify for the prosecution in the sensational trial of anti-war activists accused of a terrorist plot." Horn stated: "To me it stands on: Freedom of thought ‚Äî but government spying in homes, in libraries and universities inhibits and destroys this freedom."
Later work for academic freedom.
After her release from prison, Horn continued to speak out on issues of academic and intellectual freedom. At first, the American Library Association's Executive Board refused publicly to support Horn‚Äôs stand against the government‚Äôs attempts to intimidate and silence Vietnam War protesters. Later, after questioning Horn for hours, the Board reversed its stance and officially commended Horn for her "commitment...in defense of intellectual freedom." Eventually she was given assistance by the association's Social Responsibilities Round Table, as well as the Leroy Merritt Humanitarian Fund and the Freedom to Read Foundation. Judith Krug, longtime director of the American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom, has called Horn "the first librarian who spent time in jail for a value of our profession."
In 1995, Horn published her memoirs, titled "ZOIA! Memoirs of Zoia Horn, Battler for the People‚Äôs Right to Know." In its review of Horn's memoirs, the Library Journal called Horn "a courageous crusader." Horn has continued to speak out on issues of intellectual freedom, including writing an article on a small-city Oklahoma librarian who was dismissed by the City Commission after being accused of supplying "subversive" materials (including subscriptions to "The Nation", "The New Republic" and "Soviet Russia Today") at the library. She has also defended a gay librarian in Oakland, California who was "attacked for creating a display of gay library materials," and speaking out against the Patriot Act. She has also spoken in opposition to libraries' proposals to charge fees, arguing that the "payment of any fee in a public library" resembles censorship in creating "barriers to information access." In 2002, she was awarded the Jackie Eubanks Memorial Award and the Robert B. Downs Intellectual Freedom Award.
Opposition to Patriot Act.
Most recently, Horn has been outspoken in her opposition to the provisions of the Patriot Act concerning library surveillance, and allowing the FBI to obtain a warrant from a secret court for library or bookstore records of anyone connected to an investigation concerning terrorism or spying. Interviewed at age 84 by the "San Francisco Chronicle", Horn was asked about the FBI's monitoring of America's libraries. Horn said that her first thought was: "Here we go again." Horn has criticized the law on grounds that it does not require any showing that evidence of wrongdoing is likely to be found or that the target of its investigation is involved in a crime. A librarian could be served with a warrant and must surrender records of the patron's book borrowing or Internet use and is prohibited from revealing the search to anyone ‚Äî including the patron. Horn has encouraged librarians to protest against the Patriot Act by refusing to comply. She noted: "They have (another) option, the option I took, to say this is not appropriate, this is not ethical in the library profession. It undermines the very essence of what a publicly supported library is."
Zoia Horn Intellectual Freedom Award.
The Intellectual Freedom Committee of the California Library Association annually awards the Zoia Horn Intellectual Freedom Award, which "honors Californian people, groups, and organizations that have made significant contributions to intellectual freedom in California." Horn has said of the award named in her honor: "I have especially warm feelings toward this honor because the CLA has been very supportive of my efforts."

The source of the term is uncertain, but the "Encyclopedia of Swearing" stated the most reasonable and most likely origin of the term is the one proposed by Leo Rosten According to Rosten,
According to Rosten, Jewish U.S. merchants continued to sign with an 'O' in place of an 'X' for several decades, spreading the nickname "kike" wherever they went as a result.
According to the "Oxford English Dictionary", it may be an alteration of the endings ‚Äì"ki" or ‚Äì"ky" common in the personal names of Jews in eastern Europe who immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century. The first recorded use of the term is in 1904. A variation or expansion of this theory published in "Our Crowd", by Stephen Birmingham, postulates that the term "kike" was coined as a put-down by the assimilated U.S. Jews from Germany to identify eastern European and Russian Jews: "Because many Russian names ended in 'ki', they were called 'kikes'‚Äîa German Jewish contribution to the American vernacular. The name then proceeded to be co-opted by non-Jews as it gained prominence in its usage in society, and was later used as a general derogatory slur.."
One more theory traces the origin of the term much earlier in time, to the 16th century Pope Clement VIII, noted for his anti-Jewish stance. Among other things, he issued a prohibition on the study of the Talmud, in which he made reference to the "blind () obstinacy" of the Jews. According to this theory, "caeca" developed eventually into "kike".
In addition to the mysterious origin of this term, is that in 1864 in the UK, the word "ike" or "ikey" was used as a derogatory term for Jews, which derived from the name "Isaac", a common Jewish name.
Usage.
According to different sources, some would say that the first use would have been evident in Ellis Island by all Americans as a labeling term for Jewish people, or it was used primarily by Jewish-Americans to put down Jewish immigrants. This word has even been found to be used in the United Kingdom. Regardless of who used this term in the beginning, whether used primarily by Jewish-Americans, just all Americans, or both Americans and English, this term has now become less popular in the United Kingdom, and has now become more apparent in the United States; and throughout its history, this term has been used as a derogatory word to disparage Jewish people.

Reactions to the September 11 attacks

Reactions to the September 11 attacks included condemnation from world leaders, other political and religious representatives and the international media, as well as numerous memorials and services all over the world. The attacks were widely condemned by the governments of the world, including those traditionally considered hostile to the United States, such as Cuba, Iran, Libya, and North Korea. However, in a few cases celebrations of the attacks were also reported by Canada, and some groups and individuals accused the United States in effect of bringing the attacks on itself.
Many countries introduced anti-terrorism legislation and froze the bank accounts of businesses and individuals they suspected of having connections with al-Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden, the accused perpetrators of the attacks.
United States.
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the Bush administration declared a war on terrorism, with the stated goals of bringing Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks. These goals would be accomplished by means including economic and military sanctions against states perceived as harboring terrorists and increasing global surveillance and intelligence sharing. Within hours after the September 11 attacks, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld speculated on possible involvement by Saddam Hussein and ordered his aides to make plans for striking Iraq; although unfounded, the association contributed to public acceptance for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The second-biggest operation of the US Global War on Terrorism outside of the United States, and the largest directly connected to terrorism, was the overthrow of the Taliban rule from Afghanistan, by a US-led coalition.
Muslim Americans.
In a Joint Statement by "American Muslim Alliance", American Muslim Council, "Association of Muslim Scientists and Engineers", "Association of Muslim Social Scientists", Council on American-Islamic Relations, "Islamic Medical Association of North America", Islamic Circle of North America, Islamic Society of North America, "Ministry of Imam W. Deen Mohammed", Muslim American Society and Muslim Public Affairs Council, stated:
American Muslims utterly condemn the vicious and cowardly acts of terrorism against innocent civilians. We join with all Americans in calling for the swift apprehension and punishment of the perpetrators. No political cause could ever be assisted by such immoral acts. 
Controversial Christian Americans.
Two days following the attacks, on the Christian television program "The 700 Club", television evangelist Jerry Falwell called the event a punishment from God and laid the blame on "paganists", "abortionists", "feminists" and "gays and lesbians", claiming that they "helped this happen". Host Pat Robertson concurred with the statements. Both evangelists came under attack from President George W. Bush for their statements, Falwell subsequently apologized.
Western world.
After the attacks many governments and organizations in the West expressed shock and sympathy, and were supportive of burgeoning efforts to combat terrorism. Among them:
United Nations.
Then-Secretary General of the UN Kofi Annan, said: "We are all traumatized by this terrible tragedy."
Islamic world.
Almost all Muslim political and religious leaders condemned the attacks. The leaders vehemently denouncing the attacks included the leaders of Egypt (Hosni Mubarak), the Palestinian Authority (Yasser Arafat), Libya (Muammar Gaddafi), Syria (Bashar al-Assad), Iran (Mohamed Khatami) and Pakistan (Pervez Musharraf). The sole exception was Iraq, when the then-president Saddam Hussein, said of the attacks that "the American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity". Saddam would later offer sympathy to the Americans killed in the attacks.
Polls taken by Saudi owned Al Arabiya and Gallup suggest some support for the September 11 attacks within the Islamic world, with 38% believing the attacks to be not justified, while 36% believing them to be justified. A 2008 study, produced by Gallup, found different results with 7% of the sample of Muslims polled believing the 9/11 attacks were at least 'completely justified', while 23.1% believed them to be 'somewhat justified'.
Palestinian celebrations.
A group of Palestinians were filmed celebrating in the street in celebration of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the deaths of Americans. Fox News reported that in Ein el-Hilweh, Lebanon's largest Palestinian refugee camp, revelers fired weapons in the air, with similar celebratory gunfire heard at the Rashidiyeh camp near the southern city of Tyre as well.
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) condemned the attacks and attempted to censure and discredit broadcasts and other news reports. with many newspapers, magazines, Web sites and wire services running photographs. The PNA claimed such celebrations were not representative of the sentiments of the Palestinian people, and the Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo said the PNA would not allow "a few kids" to "smear the real face of the Palestinians". In an attempt to quash further reporting, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, Arafat's Cabinet secretary, said the Palestinian Authority could not "guarantee the life" of an Associated Press (AP) cameraman if footage he filmed of post-9/11 celebrations in Nablus was broadcast. Rahman's statement prompted a formal protest from the AP bureau chief, Dan Perry.
Annette Kr√ºger Spitta of the ARD's (German public broadcasting) TV magazine "Panorama" states that footage not aired shows that the street surrounding the celebration in Jerusalem is quiet. Furthermore, she states that a man in a white T-shirt incited the children and gathered people together for the shot. The "Panorama" report, dated September 20, 2001, quotes Communications Professor Martin L√∂ffelholz explaining that in the images one sees jubilant Palestinian children and several adults but there is no indication that their pleasure is related to the attack. The woman seen cheering (Nawal Abdel Fatah) stated afterwards that she was offered cake if she celebrated on camera, and was frightened when she saw the pictures on television afterward.
There was also rumour that the footage of some Palestinians celebrating the attacks was stock footage of Palestinian reactions to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. This rumour was proven false shortly afterwards, and "CNN" issued a statement to that effect. A poll conducted by the Fafo Foundation in the Palestinian Authority in 2005 found that 65% of respondents supported the September 11 attacks.

ATPase assay

The ATPase assay is a membrane assay that indirectly measures the activity of efflux transporters. ATP Binding Cassette or efflux transporters mediate the transport of substrates across cell membranes against a concentration gradient. ATP cleavage is tightly linked to substrate translocation, as the energy for the substrate translocation is derived from ATP hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis yields inorganic phosphate (Pi), which can be measured by a simple colorimetric reaction. The amount of Pi liberated is directly proportional to the activity of the transporter.
Use of ATPase Assay.
The ATPase assay is designed to indicate the nature of the interaction between the compound and the transporter. The ATPase assays are used in two different modes: ATPase activation and ATPase inhibition. Transported substrates increase baseline ATPase activity, while inhibitors or slowly transported compounds inhibit baseline ATPase activity and/or the ATPase activity measured in the presence of a stimulating agent. The ATPase assays can therefore have the potential for determining whether a compound acts as a transporter substrate and/or inhibitor.
Mutations in the ATPase domain result in loss of transport function. The activity of the multidrug transporter in drug-resistant cells is associated with rapid cellular ATP depletion when ATP synthesis is inhibited.

<doc id="20557509" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20557509" title="Evolutionary data mining">
Evolutionary data mining

Evolutionary data mining, or genetic data mining is an umbrella term for any data mining using evolutionary algorithms. While it can be used for mining data from DNA sequences, it is not limited to biological contexts and can be used in any classification-based prediction scenario, which helps "predict the value ... of a user-specified goal attribute based on the values of other attributes." For instance, a banking institution might want to predict whether a customer's credit would be "good" or "bad" based on their age, income and current savings. Evolutionary algorithms for data mining work by creating a series of random rules to be checked against a training dataset. The rules which most closely fit the data are selected and are mutated. The process is iterated many times and eventually, a rule will arise that approaches 100% similarity with the training data. This rule is then checked against a test dataset, which was previously invisible to the genetic algorithm.
Process.
Data preparation.
Before databases can be mined for data using evolutionary algorithms, it first has to be cleaned, which means incomplete, noisy or inconsistent data should be repaired. It is imperative that this be done before the mining takes place, as it will help the algorithms produce more accurate results.
If data comes from more than one database, they can be integrated, or combined, at this point. When dealing with large datasets, it might be beneficial to also reduce the amount of data being handled. One common method of data reduction works by getting a normalized sample of data from the database, resulting in much faster, yet statistically equivalent results.
At this point, the data is split into two equal but mutually exclusive elements, a test and a training dataset. The training dataset will be used to let rules evolve which match it closely. The test dataset will then either confirm or deny these rules.
Data mining.
Evolutionary algorithms work by trying to emulate natural evolution. First, a random series of "rules" are set on the training dataset, which try to generalize the data into formulas. The rules are checked, and the ones that fit the data best are kept, the rules that do not fit the data are discarded. The rules that were kept are then mutated, and multiplied to create new rules.
This process iterates as necessary in order to produce a rule that matches the dataset as closely as possible. When this rule is obtained, it is then checked against the test dataset. If the rule still matches the data, then the rule is valid and is kept. If it does not match the data, then it is discarded and the process begins by selecting random rules again.

<doc id="20557517" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20557517" title="U.S. Route 31 in Indiana">
U.S. Route 31 in Indiana

U.S. Route 31 (US¬†31) is a part of the United States Numbered Highway System that runs from Spanish Fort, Alabama, to the Mackinaw City, Michigan. In the U.S. state of Indiana, it is a State Road that enters the state via the George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge between Louisville, Kentucky, and Clarksville, Indiana. The of US¬†31 that lie within Indiana serve as a major conduit. Some of the highway is listed on the National Highway System. Various sections are rural two-lane highway and urbanized four-lane divided expressway. The northernmost community along the highway is South Bend near the Michigan state line.
US¬†31 was first designated as a US Highway in 1926. A section of the highway originally served as part of the Dixie Highway. US¬†31 replaced the original State Road 1 (SR¬†1) designation of the highway which dated back to the formation of the Indiana State Road system. SR¬†1 ran from Clarksville through Indianapolis to South Bend and ended at the Michigan state line.
Route description.
Only the segment of US¬†31 that is north of Indianapolis is included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other U.S. Routes in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were the 3,690¬†vehicles and 160¬†commercial vehicles used the highway daily near Memphis. The peak traffic volumes were 168,770¬†vehicles and 18,090¬†commercial vehicles AADT along the section of US¬†31 concurrent with Interstate 465 (I‚Äì465).
Jeffersonville to Columbus.
US 31 overlaps I-65 in Jeffersonville, after crossing the George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge from Kentucky. It then diverges as the access frontage lanes before splitting off north of Jeffersonville at Clarksville and proceeding to Indianapolis. US 31 was recently widened to two lanes in both directions for its length through Columbus.
Columbus to Indianapolis.
At I-465 on the south side of Indianapolis, US 31 is routed onto I-465 to the east of the city. This is the closest approach the highway makes to downtown Indianapolis. (Previously the route of the highway through Indianapolis was on East Street, Madison Avenue, North Street, and then Meridian Street.)
Indianapolis to Michigan.
US 31 exits I-465 (coincidentally at Exit 31) in southern Hamilton County, and continues northward, primarily as a divided highway. US 31 then passes through or near Carmel, Kokomo, Rochester, Plymouth, and Lakeville. As US 31 approaches southern South Bend, the route becomes a full interstate-grade freeway as it converges with US 20/St. Joseph Valley Parkway and proceeds west then north, bypassing South Bend and proceeding into Michigan. (See U.S. Route 31 in Michigan.)
History.
US¬†31 was signed by the Governor on March 7 of 1917, as Main Market Highway 1, signs were installed on June 1 of the that year. The name was changed to Indiana State Road 1, within a year, when Indiana began the state road system. By 1924, most of the route was paved, leaving only from Columbus to Franklin and from Peru to Plymouth that was unpaved. In 1926, US¬†31 signs were installed along what was SR¬†1 at the time. By 1927 the whole route through Indiana was paved.
Kokomo.
The Kokomo Corridor Project, part of the Indiana Department of Transportation Major Moves Project designed to convert US 31 to Interstate-grade freeway from South Bend to Indianapolis, covered of new highway primarily in Howard County. The new limited-access highway was built east of Kokomo and has five interchanges at SR 26, E. Boulevard (CR 100S), US 35/SR 22 (Markland Avenue), Touby Pike and US 35 north of Kokomo. Groundbreaking for the project occurred in the afternoon of September 17, 2008, only hours after the groundbreaking for the South Bend-to-Plymouth stretch. This section of highway was scheduled to be completed in December 2013. The bypass opened ahead of schedule with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on November 26, 2013. The former section of US¬†31 was redesignated as Indiana State Road 931.
Future.
Freeway upgrades for northern sections.
Two sections of US 31 in Northern Indiana are being relocated or upgraded. As with the Kokomo bypass, both are part of the INDOT Major Moves Project designed to convert US 31 to Interstate-grade freeway from South Bend to Indianapolis. The conversion of these over-capacity segments is expected to be completed in 2015. Funding has yet to be approved for the 78 miles of US 31 not along the Kokomo bypass located between these two segments.
South Bend to Plymouth.
The New US 31 Plymouth to South Bend project will relocate US 31 on primarily new alignment from US 30 near Plymouth to US 20/St. Joseph Valley Parkway south of South Bend. Groundbreaking for the project occurred on September 17, 2008, and the first portions to be completed will be overpasses at two locations, Lilac Road and Plymouth-Goshen Trail in northern Marshall County. This section of highway is scheduled to open by the end of 2014.
Hamilton County.
The New US 31 Hamilton County project will upgrade US 31 to freeway standards from near SR 38 north of Westfield to Interstate 465 near the Marion County line and Indianapolis. Construction is expected to be completed by 2015.
Tipton County.
In addition, the state of Indiana has announced plans to construct an interchange at SR 28 in Tipton County beginning in 2015.

He had a career best year in 1970, winning four times, finishing third in earnings, and claiming the PBA's Steve Nagy Sportsmanship Award. He was a 1979 inductee into the PBA Hall of Fame.
Soutar continued his success at the senior level, capturing major championships at the 1999 Senior Tournament of Champions, 2000 USBC Senior Masters and 2003 Senior U.S. Open. He is the only PBA player to win both the USBC Masters and Senior USBC Masters. He is also one of only three bowlers to win a regular or Senior PBA title in five decades (joining Dick Weber and Johnny Petraglia). In 2011, Soutar set the all-time record for Senior PBA Tour appearances when he bowled in his 250th event in Dayton, Ohio.
Dave was ranked 20th on the PBA's 2008 list of "50 Greatest Players of the Last 50 Years", which celebrated the organization's 50th anniversary. His career earnings (with senior events included) are over US$1.2 million.

, often abbreviated , is a Japanese variety show hosted by the popular Japanese owarai duo, Downtown, with comedian H≈çsei Yamasaki and owarai duo Cocorico co-hosting. The program has been broadcast on Nippon TV since its pilot episode on October 3, 1989 and continues to this day, having celebrated its 1000th episode on April 18, 2010. The program currently broadcasts on Nippon TV and its regional affiliates from 10:56 p.m. until 11:26 p.m JST.
Segments.
Batsu Games.
Perhaps the best known "Gaki no Tsukai" episodes are those dealing with batsu games, or punishment games, in which one or more of the cast members are subjected to after losing bets, major competition, or physical challenges.
The "No Laughing" "batsu" game itself (broadcast annually during the New Year's Holiday) was first introduced in 2003. The premise of each "No Laughing"-punishment game is that the losing members of the cast have to endure many compromising, absurd, generally ridiculous situations for a long period of time (up to 24-hours, thus far) but must refrain from laughing at any of them. Whenever someone does laugh the announcer of the game will declare that person as having just become "out" („Ç¢„Ç¶„Éà or "a-u-to" in Katakana); immediately afterwards, the appropriate number of "hang-men" will come out to mete the rule breaker's punishment. (To date, this has almost always been executed via single strikes on the buttocks {or somewhere in that area} with a weapon ‚Äî one which does not change mid-game.)
To keep the participants on their toes, there have been occasions where other conditions besides laughing had been set that could make them out, if fulfilled; also, the "victors" of the preliminary trial (if there are any) can make appearances during games to wreak further mischief and potentially cause even more discomfort to the losers.
List of Batsu Games.
The following is a complete list of batsu games featured on "Gaki no Tsukai".
After losing a bet (Bet aired on Jan. 16, 1990) on who would win the K≈çhaku Uta Gassen singing competition, Matsumoto had to wreak havoc in the morning news show "Zoom In!! Asa!" that was broadcast live.
Matsumoto played a game of shiritori (Game aired on Apr. 24, 1990) with Hamada, with an additional rule: all words used were to contain the syllable "su" („Åô). Matsumoto lost the game after he repeated one of his words. As a consequence, he had to advertise Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende! on TV, in a sadomasochistic way.
Hamada lost a bet (Bet aired on Jul. 24, 1990) to Matsumoto, in which they predicted who would win the 1990 Japan Series in Nippon Professional Baseball. The batsu Game for Hamada would be to skydive from a height of 4000 meters above ground.
Hamada won a golf game (Game aired on Dec. 11, 1990) and Matsumoto had to welcome a group of people into a room, dressed in a kimono and make-up, portraying a female Japanese hostess.
Matsumoto lost a baseball game (Game aired on Feb. 12, 1991) and had to swim in the chilly waters, together with his team.
This is the first time audiences are involved. Matsumoto and 500 other people competed in a dodgeball game (Game aired on May 28, 1991) with Hamada and 500 other people. Matsumoto lost the game and had to take a roller coaster ride with a bald wig.
This is the second time Hamada and Matsumoto bet (Bet aired on Dec. 29, 1991) on who would win the K≈çhaku singing competition. Matsumoto lost and had to be the SMPTE color bars background for the Morning News broadcast 'Live' on TV.
Hamada team and Matsumoto team played a rugby match (Match aired on Jun. 7, 1992) and Matsumoto lost. He had to act like a trained seal and listen to orders by his 'master' Hamada.
This was the third time Hamada and Matsumoto bet (Bet aired on Dec. 20, 1992) on who would win the K≈çhaku singing competition. Matsumoto lost again and had to be a white dove (the mascot of Nihon Television) for the Morning News broadcast 'Live' on TV, singing the lyrics "Am I stupid? Am I a fool?" to the tune of the NTV logo jingle.
Matsumoto challenged Hamada to a high-jump competition (Competition aired on Jul. 11, 1993) and Hamada lost at 1.4m. He had to go to √âvian-les-Bains, France with the crew to get Matsumoto a bottle of "Evian" mineral water straight from the source.
This was the fourth time Hamada and Matsumoto bet (Bet aired on Dec. 26, 1993) on who would win the K≈çhaku singing competition. Matsumoto lost again and had to do a comedy skit with his mother on a midnight programme.
This was the fifth time Hamada and Matsumoto bet (Bet aired on Dec. 18, 1994) on who would win the K≈çhaku singing competition. Hamada lost and had to go to New York City with Suga Kenji to fetch a mechanical pencil that Matsumoto lent to composer Ryuichi Sakamoto. On returning, Matsumoto discovers that the rubber on top of the mechanical pencil is missing so Hamada had to return to New York and recover the rubber.
Hamada loses a golf challenge against the rest of the cast (Challenge aired on May 24, 1998) and must go to Los Angeles with Matsumoto's mother to shoot the love scene from "Titanic".
Hamada loses a golf challenge against the rest of the cast (Challenge aired on Oct. 18, 1998) and had to do about 30 advertisements for Nittere over a 24-hour period.
In "Gaki no tsukai - YAMASAKI Scale ga Chiisai Saiban", Yamasaki is brought into the Gaki no Tsukai court to stand trial for the scaredy-cat disposition he exhibits during events, games, and with co-workers.
He gets convicted, and is forced to endure the appropriate batsu game as a consequence - a 1-night stay at the empty high-school to play a series of one-piece recitals without being scared by all the traps that were set up for him.
A batsu game that took place over the period of 24 hours where all the cast, except Matsumoto, are locked in a sports arena, playing "tag" with various Oni (demons) (who, here,‚Äîexcept for two or three instances {that were on film},‚Äîwere men dressed in full-body black suits) that were "summoned" to attack at random moments, each with a specific type of punishment written on the suit to be inflicted whenever the victims were tagged. This batsu game is the result of Matsumoto winning the race against the four others in "Gaki no tsukai - 4 tai 1 100m sou Taiketsu!" (on Oct. 17, 1999).
After Matsumoto loses a swimming match (match aired on Feb. 11, 2001) against the other four cast members, a batsu game is set at a "haunted ryokan", where Matsumoto must remain overnight. He endures ghost apparitions, a seemingly empty samurai suit that comes alive, and random knocks on walls, among other things. The other four cast members attend to support him in controlling his fear, but end up scaring him as well.
Matsumoto's team (compiled of him and Heipo) loses to Hamada's team in a long-jump segment (long-jump aired on May 5, 2002) due to Heipo's jump failing to beat the other team and has to perform with his father, mother, older sister, and brother as a Sentai/Power Ranger team.
In this game, Matsumoto is punished for losing a bet (bet aired on Oct. 27, 2002) with Hamada over the 2002 Japan Series. In their bet, Hamada picked the Yomiuri Giants while Matsumoto picked the Seibu Lions; the Giants won the series four games to none. Matsumoto's punishment was having to spend a day at home while Hamada, End≈ç, Tanaka and Yamasaki threw pies at him (after showering and in bed) and everything he touched (including a television set and a toaster), non-stop. Matsumoto had to ignore all of this while following prompts from a narrator over the sound-system.
The first No-Laughing Batsu Game, shot in Yamanashi, it served as the punishment for Matsumoto, Yamasaki, End≈ç, and Tanaka, for losing to Hamada in a 4 vs. 1 bowling match (which aired on May 18, 2003).
Getting caught laughing during this game resulted in having a dart from a blow-gun shot into the buttocks. Given the newness of the concept, this punishment game was carried out in a somewhat "primitive" way: the Watchers were more lenient with enforcing "the rule", and the "auto" sound blared rough over the sound-system that was set up through the facility.
Dec. 14 & 21, 2003: Hama-chan Vladivostok Back Hand 
In a Russian Roulette style game involving sushi, Yamasaki, Tanaka, and Hamada lost and were punished in the second spa-themed no-laughing batsu game, filmed at Yugawara, Kanagawa. A riding crop was the punishment device employed. Matsumoto and Endo joined the game half-way as "The Mad Brothers." This batsu game features End≈ç's luchador character Dynamite Shikoku.
Matsumoto, Yamasaki, End≈ç, and Tanaka are punished after losing another Russian Roulette style game where they shocked themselves. This time, they are sent to 'high school' for one day. The punishment weapon for this game is the shinai, and Hamada participated as one of the hang-men, frequently delivering a strong kick along with the regular punishment. It was revealed that this game was shot during Matsumoto's birthday.
This batsu game premiered as a three-hour special. The losing players were Yamasaki, Hamada, and End≈ç, who lost at a Russian Roulette style game using large tubs suspended from the studio ceiling, and cutting loose the one's that fell, thus earning them a spot in the Batsu Game. The weapon used for the punishments in this game is a straightstick baton. Matsumoto and Tanaka avoided the batsu, and later appeared in the game, visiting the three punished players. The hang-men were especially rough when giving discipline to offenders.
For this special, Downtown, Yamasaki, and Cocorico all took part of the most infamous punishment game ‚Äî and they were forced to cross-dress as nurses for the game's duration. Yamasaki, who had just completed a hospital stay after being treated for enteritis, was permitted to take some absences during the game. Among the famous guests who performed here were Sonny Chiba, Masahiro Chono and many other comedy duos in Japan. (As a side note, it was during this game that the record at the time for most punishment-strikes ever inflicted was set, with Hitoshi Matsumoto having received a total of 259 of them.)
For the second time around, all five members of the regular cast took part in the annual punishment game. This year the chosen setting was a newspaper agency. The members had to go to a number of mock press conferences dressed as journalists. End≈ç's ex-wife Chiaki made a guest appearance in a conference about her "new husband." In keeping with the theme of the punishment game, giant latex pencils were used to strike anyone who had been declared "out".
For the third consecutive time, Yamazaki, Downtown, and Cocorico took part in the annual punishment game. The setting was a hotel and it aired on New Year's Eve at 6:30pm until 12:30am on New Year's Day. Numerous cameo and guest appearances were made, including Masahiro Chono, Masahiro Tanaka, Natsumi Ogawa ( Hamada's wife ), End≈ç's ex-wife Chiaki, Jyunji End≈ç ( End≈ç's younger brother), Masako Mori, Ayumi Nakamura, Monta Yoshinori, and Yoshimi Iwasaki.
The members of Gaki no Tsukai partake in their fourth annual punishment game. Filmed in Ibaraki prefecture, this Batsu's setting was a spy school and it was aired on New Year's Eve at 6:30pm to 12:30am on New Year's Day. Over 100 celebrities were involved with the filming including Itao Itsuji, Matsuko Deluxe, Masahiro Chono, Bibari Maeda, Claudia Umemiya and Tatsuo Umemiya.
The Gaki no Tsukai cast participate in the 5th annual punishment game (the 6th New Years show in the No Laughing Series). The filming took place at Ibaraki Airport, in November 2011. Here Hamada, Matsumoto, Yamasaki, Endo and Tanaka were trained to become CA's (or Flight Attendants). The airing began on New Year's Eve 31 December 2011 at 6:30pm and ran through 12:30am the next day (Japanese Standard Time). (This year broke through the 2007 record with Matsumoto receiving 302 punishments.)
The Gaki no Tsukai cast participate in the 6th annual punishment game (the 7th New Years show in the No Laughing Series).
The Gaki no Tsukai cast participate in the 7th annual punishment game (the 8th new years show in the No Laughing Series). This game implemented 250 CCD Cameras, 27 ENG units, 70 from technical staff and extra 210 people which brings the total staff number by 500.
Silent Library.
In Silent Library („Çµ„Ç§„É¨„É≥„ÉàÂõ≥Êõ∏È§®, "Sairento Toshokan"), the cast and a sixth member, usually Heipo, are in a staged library in which one of them has to undergo a punishment upon choosing the card with the skull and crossbones on it (similar to Russian roulette). Although the game requires that they remain silent during the entire segment, the members repeatedly let out bursts of muffled laughter that is loud enough for the occupants of the library to hear. An example of punishments are being "Outwitted" (having a nose hair pulled from the nostril), "Nose Fishing" (a metal clamp attached to the inside of both nostrils being pulled), and "Hot Earmuffs" (boiled earmuffs put on both ears). Former K-1 champion Ernesto Hoost once made a special appearance, as well as writer and film director K≈çki Mitani.
This segment was adapted into an American game show, called Silent Library. The international version of the show is referred to as Fist of Zen. It debuted on MTV on June 15, 2009.
≈ågiri Daigassen.
Chinko Machine.
In a segment from the episode "≈ågiri Daigassen", the participants must recite a long, tongue twister-like promotion for the show without stopping or stuttering. If a participant fails, they are attacked by the "chinko machine", literally the "penis machine", a catapult-like lever that swings up and hits the participant in the genitals. On this episode, Yamazaki was the only participant who was able to recite the whole tongue twister (although he was not so lucky on other instances). This batsu game was featured on the August 1, 2006 "Oddball" segment of Countdown with Keith Olbermann as "Reason Number 261 (of 527) why Japanese television is better than ours."
Ass Game.
In this game, one contestant is strapped to a chair while another contestant is carried by a statue which rests on conveyors, with his legs split open, thus leaving his underwear-covered genital regions aligned towards the head of the strapped contestant. As the two are asked questions, their answer must be the same. If their answers do not match, the contestant on the conveyor's genital regions brought closer to the head of the strapped contestant. If most of their answers do not match, the genital regions are pressed against the head of the strapped contestant. The contestants were Matsumoto Hitoshi, Tanaka Naoki, Hamada Masatoshi, and Yamazaki Hosei. 
An alternate and early version of the "Ass Game" involved the players being threatened by other cast members, on all fours and wearing an outfit with the rear end exposed. The objective in this version was to name items which fit a specified theme (such as "Name a 'Holiday'") within a time limit--those failing to do so would have the cast member wearing the rear-less outfit advancing towards them. The game was split into two rounds: in the first round, Matsumoto (threatened by Jimmy Onishi) faced Yamasaki (threatened by producer Suga); while in the second round, the positions were reversed--Onishi (threatened by Matsumoto) versus producer Suga (threatened by Yamasaki).
In a later "≈ågiri Daigassen" episode, this variation on the "Ass Game" was revived with a slight alteration: the punishment for the loser became getting kissed by an Obaachan.
Marshmallow Rubber Band.
In this game during an episode of oogiri daigassen, the contestants are divided into Red and Blue teams. The rules consist of the contenders having to eat a marshmallow dangling from a string, while they are hindered by a rubber band which is put across their face. They are not allowed to use their hands to grab the marshmallow, although the other contestants are allowed to straighten the strings which the marshmallows are attached to. The entire game ended with the Blue team as the victors.
7 Henge.
"Shichi-henge" (‰∏ÉÂ§âÂåñ, "literally" The Seven Apparitions) is a segment of the show where the cast and crew sit at a table while a comedian attempts to make them laugh. For each round that a person laughs, they must put 1,000 yen into a box; the collected money is donated to a charity of the comedian's choice. Bob Sapp once made a special appearance on this segment in which he collected 53,000 yen, at that time the record for any comedian during this segment. The record is currently held by Koumoto Junichi (Ê≤≥Êú¨Ê∫ñ‰∏Ä).
A variation on this, "Horror "Shichi-henge"", involved several members of the cast and crew ambushing Heip≈ç with the intent of causing him to lose his composure and thus be forced to surrender money.
Absolutely Tasty series.
This is a series of cooking segments in which the comedians prepare foods, either traditional Japanese dishes like taiyaki, takoyaki, nabe and chawanmushi or foods like pizza, with unusual ingredients to use as fillings or flavors, which is eaten later and given a score ranging from two "skull marks" to ten stars. However, in recent episodes, the cast ignores the rating system more frequently, instead resorting to giving unpleasant dishes various numbers of "ass hairs" and "pubic hairs" Endo is notorious for using Frisk, a brand of very strong breath mint, in his food. The results are usually disastrous and very distasteful. Yamazaki frequently uses junk food such as cheese puffs for rice, onigiri and sausages for taiyaki, hamburgers, hot dogs, fried chicken, fries and coke soda for nabe, peanut butter for takoyaki, and jelly beans for tempura. Matsumoto usually introduces very unusual (and occasionally inedible) ingredients such as a bear's paw for takikomi gohan, pig's and tuna's head for pizza, a dried cobra for nabe, a seal's testicle for takoyaki, and toothpaste for pasta. Hamada is notable for using corn bread and corn soup for Tempura, and thus was the only one who ever received the unprecedented Angel mark. If there was a food item that none of the cast members wanted to eat, producer Heipo was forced to eat it, always resulting in him spitting the food out or expressing utter disgust except in the case of the individual bee larvae tempura.
Kiki series.
This is a series of competitions where each member tastes a randomly selected product, mostly food and drink but once cigarettes, from many different brands blindfolded. After the tasting period, they must find the product they tasted. Anyone who selects correctly will receive a prize money, usually 100,000 yen, otherwise they take a variety of punishments, such as being hit in the groin by a Chinko Machine or getting slapped by a foreigner.(Almir)
Goodbye, Yamasaki.
An annual running gag since 2001, the audience is told that Yamasaki is leaving the show (when he really is not). This includes farewell speeches from the cast and some crew members, who give flowers to a distressed Yamasaki. Yamasaki then makes his own speech, but ends up sobbing hysterically and is dragged offstage. However, this always ends with Yamasaki telling them that he's not leaving, because he pulled a prank on Downtown and Cocorico.
High Tension series.
This is a series where comedians perform their special high-tension acts. There are two patterns of the show. One is in
"The Best Ten" show, which is a parody of countdown shows. The hosts are Hamada and Matsumoto, wearing a black tuxedo and a woman's dress, respectively. The other is in a team competition between Team Hamada and Team Matsumoto.
In "The Best Ten" format, three other regular casts also perform and usually present in certain places; Tanaka at the 10th, Endo, usually with greased hair and wears nothing but white underpants, in the top half, and Yamasaki at the 1st.
Genkai series.
The Genkai series is a series of challenges involving foods and how much they can change the pronunciation of these foods while still being able to order them at a restaurant or cafe. For example, for one challenge, they started with ordering "ice coffee" at a cafe, then switched to "ice moffee", "nice coffee", "mice moffee", "nice coach", "aisou warai" (a phrase meaning "pretending to laugh when it's not funny"), "coffee coffee", "atsui coffee" (meaning "hot coffee"), "tansu nouhin" ("dresser delivery"), "aitsu mouii" ("i've had enough of that guy"), "high society", "iron hero", and finally "OuYang FeiFei" (a Chinese singer). Predictably, the waiter/waitress becomes confused and either gives up trying to understand or berates the person ordering.
Other challenges include: Hiyashi Chuuka "cold noodles", Mild Seven "a cigarette brand", Katsu Kare "pork cutlet and curry rice", Chashumen "ramen noodles with chashu pork", Naporitan (Neapolitan) "spaghetti-like noodles", Omuraisu "rice with ketchup and egg"
Gas Nuki.
The cast enter a restaurant where they have to fart to eat the next meal course. Done in a French restaurant and a Sushi restaurant.
Yamasaki VS Moriman.
A series of comedic fighting bouts between Yamasaki and Holstein Morio of the female comedian duo Moriman. The main running gag is that Yamasaki has never won a match since 1996.
The event also features Endo's wrestling alter ego Dynamite Shikoku. He is accompanied to the ring by 2 women in kimonos and proceeds to fight in a match. The running gag is that he pulls a leg muscle during the match, and he always loses. After being checked out by the ringside doctor (Konya Ga Yamada), the match ends and Shikoku stands back up to address the crowd. After the speech he invites the crowd to join him in his trademark dance and is promptly taken out of the ring in a stretcher.
Technician Challenge.
The Technician Challenge series is a series of sex-related challenges from Matsumoto to the other regular members, expanding in later series to include some semi-regulars. Matsumoto sends a letter, including a hand-drawn map, to the assembled other members through his manager. The manager leads the members to Matsumoto, who explains the challenge. Each challenge is sex-related and comes with an appropriate punishment for the lowest achiever. The first challenge was speed bra-unhooking, where the members had to unhook the bras on a certain number of mannequins as quickly as possible. Other challenges include speed kissing (kissing plastic lips on the walls while traveling through a corridor), speed nipple-play (pressing the nipples of mannequins with bells for breasts), speed hip movement (pumping an air pump using their hips), and speed panty removal (removing the panties from ten mannequins using only their feet). The punishments all followed the theme of the challenge (speed bra-unhooking had the worst achiever walk around town wearing a bra, speed panty removal had the worst achiever walk around town wearing panties on his head).
Shoji Murakami's Class series.
A series where the cast learns to be a worker in a specific occupation. Shoji Murakami usually has everyone try out and do absurd or abnormal activities. Some notable occupations include: pilot, green beret, ninja, ghostbusters, geisha, dracula, etc.
500 Questions.
The cast is asked 500 questions, which all pertain to the opinions and preferences of the person being interviewed. These questions usually begin with: "What is your favourite?", "Which is the most interesting?", etc. A matching answer will earn them a point. After 500 questions, either the person with the most number of points wins a prize or the person with the least number of points gets a punishment. Notable people who were questioned were: Tanaka, Hamada, Yamasaki's wife Aya, singer Wada Akiko, makeup artist IKKO, Sano Motoharu, Matsuko Deluxe, journalist and broadcaster Tahara S≈çichir≈ç, Downtown's former manager Fujiwara Hiroshi and manga artist Kazuo Umezu.
Five Rangers Game.
In this challenge, all five cast members enter separate dressing rooms and each randomly dress as one of the five colors of "Gorenjai" (sentai characters from Downtown's other show, "Downtown no Gottsu Ee Kanji"), and they attempt to complete all five different colors in 6 hours. The odds that the five cast members choose all the same colors is 5/3125 (0.16%), while the odds of the cast successfully choosing all different colors is 120/3125 (3.84%). The challenge is based on the main running gag of the "Gorenjai" sketches: that the team members couldn't decide who wore which colors.
On occasion, Ameagari Kesshitai join the regular cast in a Seven Rangers Game ("nanarenjai"), featuring two additional colors (black and white) added to the regular "Gorenjai" color configuration. The odds of winning "nanarenjai" are 5040/823,543 (0.612%), while the odds of losing are only 7/823,543 (0.00085%).
The rules for all variations of Gorenjai are exactly the same as in a Five Rangers Game.
Cosplay Bus Tour series.
The bus series usually includes the main cast plus some of the producers or guests cosplaying or dressing up in drag and playing mini games in a bus going around popular Tokyo locations. When one of the players loses a mini-game, he is dropped off in a public location and forced to walk back to the studio alone and looking quite absurd. Past themes include female anime characters, kogals, SM queens, and Pink Lady (Japanese pop music idols of the late 1970s).
One memorable moment was during the Anime Bus Tour, when Yamasaki (dressed as Arale from "Dr. Slump") was dropped off and told to buy take-out spaghetti for the entire cast on his way back. He attempted to walk back without buying any, but on his way, he ran into fellow contestant Miyasako of the comedy duo Ameagari Kesshitai, who had also been dropped off (dressed as Kekk≈ç Kamen). They bought the spaghetti together. Upon arriving at the studio, Miyasako revealed that Yamasaki had tried to return without buying the food. Appalled and outraged, Matsumoto ordered him to go buy spaghetti in Italy‚Äîspecifically, to go to the "very tip of its heel", referring to the country's distinct boot-like shape. A few weeks later, Yamasaki was forced to fly to Lecce, Italy to buy a plate of spaghetti from a restaurant, all the while still dressed as Arale.

Azerbaijan‚ÄìEstonia relations

Azerbaijan‚ÄìEstonia relations refer to foreign relations between Azerbaijan and Estonia. Both countries were part of Russian Empire and Soviet Union. Azerbaijan has an embassy in Tallinn. Estonia is represented in Azerbaijan through its embassy in Ankara (Turkey). Both countries are full members of the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Azerbaijan, along with Georgia, is Estonia's ally in South Caucasus. Approximately 2,500 Azerbaijanis live in Estonia.
Political relations.
First visit by Estonian government happened in 1996 when Siim Kallas, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia visited Azerbaijan and joint declarations were signed. In 2000, the Azerbaijan-Estonian inter-parliamentary working group was established in National Assembly of Azerbaijan. Estonia supported Azerbaijan in joining the Council of Europe and supports Azerbaijan's integration into Euro-Atlantic structures. President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves paid a visit to Azerbaijan in 2009 and President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev visited Estonia in 2010. Estonia supports the resolution of the issues related to the Nagorno-Karabakh and the adjacent areas through negotiations. Former Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Kristina Ojuland have stated that Nagorno-Karabakh is an "inseparable" of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is considering to cancel visa regyme with Estonia. Estonia also interests in development of cooperation with Azerbaijan within NATO's peacekeeping missions. Azerbaijan is interested in developing the high level political dialogue. Even though not many defence related co-operation projects have taken place between two nations, defense and military-related contacts have been described as "good and open-minded".
Mayor of Narva (1999‚Äì2000) and Minister of Population Affairs of Estonia (2002‚Äì2003) Eldar Efendiev also had an Azerbaijani origin.
Economic relations.
Economic relations between two countries are at high level event though trade between two countries has been minimal during the past few years, but it has tremendous potential. Both intend to expand cooperation in IT and banking.
Cultural relations.
Since both countries used to be part of Russian Empire and Soviet Union, two nations met with each other's culture from early times. 
There are information from late XIX libraries of Estonia works of about works of well-known poets of Azerbaijan such as Mirza Shafi Vazeh, Molla Panah Vagif and Mirza Fatali Akhundov which was translated into German language. Translations into Estonian from German started in 1981 with Yukhan Kiyv, Gustav and Anna Haov Vulf. 
In 1978, "Scala", Estonian newspaper published some works of 
Molla Panah Vagif. The first Azerbaijani-Estonian dictionary, compiled by Vidadi Mamedov, has been published.

Piazza di San Macuto is a piazza in the Pigna rione of Rome. It contains the church of San Macuto, near which the obelisco Macuteo was rediscovered around 1373. This is a small obelisk, only 6.34 m high (14.52 m including its base). It was originally one of a pair at Ramesses II's Temple of Ra in Heliopolis, the other being the now much shorter "Obelisco Matteiano". It was moved from there to the Temple of Isis near Santa Maria sopra Minerva in antiquity, in what is now Piazza della Minerva and after its 14th century rediscovery was re-erected east of Santa Maria in Aracoeli on the Capitoline then in the Piazza della Rotonda in 1711.

Cavan (horse)

Cavan (foaled 1955) was an Irish Thoroughbred racehorse who won an American Classic Race in 1958. He was named for the town of Cavan in Ireland.
A half brother to 1964 St. Leger Stakes winner, Indiana, Cavan's dam, Willow Ann, was a daughter of Champion Sire, Solario. Cavan was sired by Mossborough, a son of Nearco, the patriarch of the most dominant sire line in Thoroughbred history. In addition to his status as a sire, "Thoroughbred Heritage" says that Nearco was "one of the greatest racehorses of the Twentieth Century". [http://www.tbheritage.com/Portraits/Pharos.html]
Cavan was purchased by Boston, Massachusetts banker Joseph O'Connell at the suggestion of Irish-born trainer Tom Barry who believed that an Irish horse was better suited for longer distances and had an edge in such American races as the prestigious Belmont Stakes. Racing in the United States in 1958, Cavan won the Leonard Richards Stakes at Delaware Park Racetrack then won the Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York, spoiling the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner Tim Tam's bid to capture the U.S. Triple Crown.
After his victory in the Belmont Stakes, Cavan next won the Peter Pan Handicap on the same track but came out of the race with an injury that ended his career. Retired to stud, Cavan met with modest success as a sire. Of his progeny, the most notable was a daughter, Miss Cavandish, who in 1964 won the Monmouth Oaks, Delaware Oaks, Alabama Stakes and Coaching Club American Oaks.
Two years after Cavan won the Belmont Stakes, Tom Barry and Joseph O'Connell came back with another Irish purchase, a colt named Celtic Ash who gave them their second Belmont Stakes win in 1960.

Pierre Brasseur (Luxembourg)

Pierre Brasseur (21 June 1832 ‚Äì 7 February 1918) was a Luxembourgian entrepreneur, businessman, and mining magnate, being involved in founding a number of industrial concerns in southern Luxembourg. Amongst them was one of the steel companies that would become ARBED, and, after many mergers and consolidations, Arcelor Mittal.
Pierre was a member of the Brasseur family, born the eleventh son of Alexis Brasseur in Esch-sur-Alzette. Along with a number of other associates, Pierre founded the Society for the Extraction of Minerals of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (). in 1861. The following year, he was awarded a concession to mine an area of near Rumelange, in Luxembourg's Red Lands. He was appointed notary in Esch-sur-Alzette in 1864.
His success allowed him to establish in 1870 the Society of Blast Furnaces of Luxembourg (), along with twenty-six other subscribers. He was one of the members of the first administrative council of the company, which directed the company until 1874. The company opened two blast furnaces in Esch in 1872 and 1873. In about 1874, he left the administrative council. However, his name would forever be attached to the furnaces in Esch. After mergers with German operations, and expansion in Esch-sur-Alzette and into Alsace-Lorraine, the company would become the second-largest industrial business in the Zollverein (after Krupp). In 1920, the firm would become ARBED, which would form a major part of Arcelor Mittal, the world's largest steel-maker.
In 1875, he was appointed notary in Differdange. Brasseur was appointed director of mines in Dudelange, which were to become the Society of Blast Furnaces and Forges of Dudelange. In 1894, he founded the first cement company in Luxembourg, at Rumelange, which became the Society of Blast Furnaces of Rumelange in 1897. He died in 7 February 1918.
On 17 November 1864, he married H√©l√®ne Wurth, daughter of Fran√ßois-Xavier Wurth-Paquet, who had been a famous Luxembourgian politician and Administrator-General for Luxembourg. Pierre's family played a key role in politics itself. His son, Xavier, was a Socialist member of the Chamber of Deputies (1902‚Äì12). Pierre's younger brother, Dominique, was also a deputy (1866‚Äì99) and mayor of Luxembourg City (1891‚Äì94). Dominique's son, and Pierre's nephew, Robert, was a deputy (1899‚Äì1925) and founder of the Liberal League.

Denholme railway station

Denholme railway station was a station on the Keighley-Queensbury section of the Queensbury Lines which ran between Keighley, Bradford and Halifax via Queensbury.
History.
The station was built by the Great Northern Railway in 1884, almost from the village of Denholme, West Yorkshire, England. It was accessed by a long dimly lit passage way from the village. The station had an island platform which was accessed by a long iron footbridge which spanned the goods yard. It closed to passengers on 23 May 1955 along with the rest of the line from Keighley to Queensbury. It remained open for goods mainly from a local timber merchants until 1961. The site has been cleared and is now occupied by a warehouse and timber yard.

U-107-class submarine

The "U-107" class was a class of submarines or U-boats planned for the Austro-Hungarian Navy () during World War I. The design was similar to the Germaniawerft UD design which had formed the basis for the Austro-Hungarian Navy's s. Two boats ("U-107" and "U-108") were laid down in early 1918 by Ganz Danubius in Fiume, but neither was launched or completed before the end of the war. No other submarines of the class were ever laid down.
Design.
The design for the "U-107" class was similar to the Germaniawerft UD design, which had formed the basis of the Austro-Hungarian boats that had been ordered in 1913 and had been sold to the Imperial German Navy in the early stages of World War I.
According to "Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906‚Äì1921", the specifications of the "U-107" class are very unclear. The displacement for the boats was to be surfaced and submerged. The boats were to be long with a beam of , but of unknown draft. For propulsion, the design featured two shafts, with twin diesel engines of (total) for surface running, and twin electric motors of (total) for submerged travel. The speed expected for the boats is not reported in "Conway's". The "U-107" class boats were designed for a crew of 36 men.
The "U-107" design called for five torpedo tubes‚Äîfour bow tubes and one stern tube‚Äîand may have been able to carry as many as twelve torpedoes. The design also specified a 10¬†cm/35 (3.9¬†in) deck gun.
Construction.
The number of planned boats is reported by "Conway's" as 35, numbered from "U-107" to "U-141". The book, however, provides no explanation of the apparent overlap of "U-118" through "U-120", which are also reported as assigned to three s. Regardless of the number planned, "Conway's" reports only four boats had any sort of construction activity. "U-107" and "U-108" were laid down by Ganz Danubius in Fiume in March and May 1918.
The boats were begun late in the war when shortages of skilled shipyard workers and materials were slowing construction of other boats under construction. As a result, none of the first four boats was ever launched or completed before the end of the war. "U-107" was 35% complete at war's end, while "U-108" was only 30% complete, respectively. Ganz Danubius had also begun stockpiling materials for "U-109" and "U-110" but had not started on these two boats. Although there is no specific mention of the fates of the pair of incomplete boats of the "U-107" class, incomplete boats from other late-war classes were scrapped 1919‚Äì1920.

<doc id="20557802" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20557802" title="Common mole rat">
Common mole rat

The Common mole rat, "Cryptomys hottentotus", is a burrowing rodent found in the continent of Africa, specifically in the southwest Cape province, South Africa. It is also found in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The common mole rat belongs to the Bathyerginae family. Bathyerginae is monophyletic, with all taxa tracing back to one common ancestor.
Physical appearance.
The average body length of a common mole rat is 10.5 to 16.5¬†cm, the tail is 1.2 to 3.8¬†cm. The fur is thick with many different colors, with a distinct white spot on the head. The shape of the body is cylindrical with short appendages. Common mole rats also have chisel-like incisors that are used for digging.
Reproduction and development.
Common mole rats are characterized for having one reproductive pair, consisting of the largest female and male in one group. Mating occurs between the months of September and October. During this time, the female raises her tail and allows the mate to smell her genital region. The male then gently chews on her hind region, mounts and mates. The birth of offspring is restricted to the southern hemisphere summer period. The gestation period is about 81 days with 2-5 young per litter. The average age at reproductive maturity is approximately 450 days. Females maintain reproductive function during non-reproductive months.
Ecology.
Common mole rats are fossorial mammals that can live in a wide range of substrates. They are herbivorous, mainly eating geophytes (plants with underground storage organs) and grass rhizomes. Common mole rats are very widespread, thus their abundance is not well known. This species shows signs of localization due to soil requirements. The pattern of burrowing systems for common mole rats optimizes their access to food, especially gephytes. Burrowing has a negative economic impact in that it damages human property but it is also positive in that it improves soil drainage and turnover.
Physiological attributes.
Common mole rats are endothermic, having the ability to generate their own heat and keep their body temperature above ambient temperature. They have lower individual body masses in arid environments that help with energy conservation. These mole rats also have long sensory hairs called Vibrissae that stand out from the pelage (fur covering) over their body.
Behavior.
Common mole rats are social creatures that live in family units up to 14 individuals. They showcase eusocial behavior, which involves specialized behavior and cooperative care of the young. Younger mole rats would likely be workers and older mole rats could be casual workers. These workers, for the most part, burrow and forage, with casual workers not working as much as younger workers. The oldest mole rats are breeders.
Tunneling.
Mole-rats have cylindrical bodies with short limbs to help inside of the tunnels. It has loose skin to fit in small spaces. Can practically somersault within its loose skin. Has hair behind its teeth to prevent dirt and soil from getting inside of the mouth. Loosens soil with teeth then pushes soil underneath its body with forefeet to the hind feet which kick it behind them.
Conservation.
The "IUCN Red List" lists "Cryptomys hottentotus" as of Least Concern. Because of their dense and widespread population and their adaptability to pasturelands and rural gardens, their prognosis is a positive one.

Thornton railway station

Thornton railway station was a station on the Keighley-Queensbury section of the Queensbury Lines which ran between Keighley, Bradford and Halifax via Queensbury. The station served the village of Thornton, West Yorkshire, England. The station had an island platform and was very close to the 20¬†arch Thornton viaduct which spanned the Pinch Beck valley. It opened for passengers in 1878 and closed in 1955
The viaduct, closed off for many years, was reopened in 2009 as part of the Great Northern Walking Trail after it had been safety checked and the former railway bed was sealed. No other parts of the former large station remain, the site now occupied by Thornton Primary School (previously Royd Mount Middle School) since 1977. However, the original goods platform and a large retaining wall are still visible and have been incorporated into the school's grounds design. The viaduct is a grade II listed building, and is unusual in that it has an 'S' shape to accommodate the natural contours of the valley. It is in an extremely picturesque location, that has remained unchanged since its construction. The final trip by train over the viaduct was in 1966, by a goods train. The station, like many others, fell victim to the Beeching plan for the British rail network. The original 'Thornton' platform sign was a large concrete affair, some long. This is on display at the Industrial Museum at Eccleshill on the outskirts of the city of Bradford.

<doc id="20557936" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20557936" title="De Birmingham family">
De Birmingham family

The de Birmingham family held the lordship of Birmingham in England for four hundred years and managed its growth from a small village into a thriving market town. They also helped invade Ireland and were rewarded with the Barony of Athenry. They were stripped of most of their lands in England by the notorious John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, who held sway over Edward VI during the early 16th century.
The Ausculphs (or Ansculfs).
A Norman baron called Ansculf de Picquigny (Ausculph de Penchengi) was granted many manors in the county of Warwickshire, and elsewhere, at the time of the Norman Conquest. They were centred upon Dudley Castle. Ansculf was observed by Sir William Dugdale (who mistakenly confused him with his son William) to have been a great man in the time of the conquest as evidenced by the extent of the lands granted to him, i.e., ten lordships in Berkshire, one in Middlesex, one in Oxfordshire, one in Huntingdonshire, one in Cambridgeshire, seven in Surrey, four in Northamptonshire, seven in Warwickshire, twenty in Buckinghamshire, twenty-five in Staffordshire and fourteen in Worcestershire.
By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 Ansculf's lands had passed onto his son, William Fitz Ansculf (or Ausculph).
The Paganells (or Paynells).
William Fitz Ausculph's daughter (Beatrice FitzWilliam FitzAnsculph?) is alleged to have married Fulk Paganel and their Paganell heirs inherited Dudley castle.
In addition the Paganell family are recorded as having succeeded William Fitz Ausculph in ownership of Birmingham and of Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire
Fulk Paganell was succeeded by his son Ralph Paganell who was in turn succeeded by his son Gervais Paganell. Gervais took part in the unsuccessful rebellion against Henry II in 1173. As a result he died, his lands were confiscated by the crown and Dudley Castle demolished.
Link between Ausculph and the de Birminghams.
Some sources claim that the de Birminghams are descended from William Fitz Ausculph and some sources refute this.
The flow of large parts of the Fitz-Ausculph estate to the Paganells lends itself to the theory that William Fitz Ausculph died with no surviving male heirs and so gave his lands to his daughter and her Paganell heirs.
According to a poem a later William de Birmingham was descended from the Ausculphs via a marriage to the Paganells. According to William Hutton's ""An History of Birmingham"" another William de Birmingham claimed in 1309 to have had ancestors who had the right to have a market in Birmingham before the Norman Conquest which would indicate that they were an old Anglo-Saxon family and not Norman.
Some sources claim the right to hold a market in Birmingham was granted to a Peter Fitz William, Steward of Dudley, and not to Peter de Birmingham who was known as Steward of Gervais Paganell. At this time people could be known by more than one name so it is probable that Peter de Birmingham and Peter Fitz William were one and the same person.
Fulk Paganell has been tenuously claimed to have had several children, one of whom is said to have been called William. It is feasible that William would have been given a small part of the Paganell lands, e.g., Birmingham, while his older brother Ralph received the rest. This could have led to William Paganell becoming known as William de Birmingham.
Richard.
According to Hutton, Richard was the name of the owner of Birmingham at the time of the Norman Conquest. Richard is said to have survived and to have been known as Lord of the manor of Birmingham by way of Knight's service to William Fitz-Ausculf.
In the "Domesday Book" of 1086 there is a record of a Richard (no surname) occupying four hides at Birmingham which belonged to William Fitz-Ansculf of Dudley Castle. Richard may or may not have been the first of the "de Birminghams".
William de Birmingham.
The first "definite" de Birmingham. Became enfeoffed of Birmingham in the reign of Henry I of England (1100‚Äì1135).
Peter de Birmingham (Peter Fitz William?).
William left Peter land of little value; Birmingham was one of the poorest manors in Warwickshire. There was little woodland and it was covered largely in scrub.
He applied to hold a cattle and food market every Thursday in the grounds of his "castle" and was granted the right by King Henry II in 1154 (some say 1166). He and his heirs were responsible for its jurisdiction. Outsiders were charged to come to the market, encouraging many merchants to live within Birmingham town and hence to pay Peter rents that far exceeded the land's agricultural value. Birmingham became the most successful market in the whole of England. From a population of 50 people in 1086 the town grew to 1500 by 1300.
In 1166 Peter is recorded to have owned a "castle" at Birmingham, to have been the Steward of Gervais Paganell and to have held nine Knight's fees by military service. The "castle" is thought to have been the Birmingham Manor House - a fortified stone manor house surrounded by a circular moat and a range of outbuildings and was probably built in the 12th century. It was rebuilt in the 13th century and remained there until the 18th century. The moat has now been filled in and the house is now the site of the Bull Ring.
Peter bore for his coat of arms:- "azure, a bend lozenge, of five points, or."
Sir William de Birmingham.
The de Birmingham family were instrumental in helping Strongbow in the Norman Invasion of Ireland. They were described as ""the noble and warlike family of the Bremichams"" and were rewarded much later with the Barony of Athenry, initially as lords of the manor. Both Sir William de Birmingham and one of his youngest sons, Robert de Birmingham, are listed as being among the Normans sent in Henry II's invasion in 1172. Robert was later styled the 1st Baron Athenry. Meyler de Bermingham took part in the invasion of Connacht in the 1230s and started to build the town of Athenry c. 1240.
In 1189 William had the charter to hold a market in Birmingham confirmed by Richard I. William bore the following coat of arms; "azure, a bend Lozenge, or".
Robert's prominent medieval descendants in Ireland included Rickard de Bermingham (d.1322) and John de Bermingham, 1st Earl of Louth (d. 1329). The last baron of Athenry died in 1799.
Peter de Birmingham.
Sir William's eldest son.
Listed by one source as being one of the barons who were in arms to secure the Magna Carta from King John between 1213 and 1215.
William de Birmingham.
William was granted the right to hold a four day fair starting on the eve of Ascension Day by Henry III in 1250. In 1251 permission was also given to hold a two day fair beginning on the eve of the Feast of St John the Baptist.
William's widow is recorded as Maud in 1263.
William de Birmingham ?-1265.
William supported Simon de Montford in the Second Barons' War against Henry III and to have died at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. The manor of Birmingham was confiscated by the King and given to Roger de Clifford. William was married to the daughter of Thomas de Astley.
A poem has been written about this William called "William de Birmingham". Its historical accuracy cannot be verified but it mentions William's claim to de descended from Ausculph via marriage to the Paganells.
William de Birmingham.
William took up his right to reclaim his father's land by way of paying a fine. In 1283 he strengthened his claims to land in Stockton Worcester, Shetford (Shutford), Oxon, Maidencoat (Maidencourt) Berks, Hoggeston Bucks and Christleton Cheshire. Maidencourt had come into the de Birmingham via a marriage to Sybil de Colville, who was the daughter of Alice de Colville who held the manor of Maidencourt in the early 13th century.
Kingston Bagpuize, Berks was also quitclaimed to him in 1290.
As a military Knight William was obliged to join Edward I at Gascony where he was taken prisoner by the French at the Siege of Bellegarde in 1297 and was carried in triumph to Paris.
Sir William de Birmingham.
Knighted in 1305. Tried the right of tollage with the people of Bromsgrove and King's Norton
Sir William de Birmingham.
Knighted in 1325 by Edward II for whom he raised four hundred infantry.
In 1327 William was summoned to Parliament. By this time Birmingham had overtaken the County Town of Warwick in terms of tax revenue. Willam's friend, Hugh Spencer, gave him custody of Dudley Castle
William's tomb lies in Birmingham's original church, St Martin in the Bull Ring, which was originally built by the de Birminghams in the 12th century.
The five diagonal lozenges of his shield form part of the Coat of arms of Birmingham.
Sir Fulk (de) Birmingham.
Married Joan and made a settlement of Kingston Bagpuize, Berks in 1340 with the advowson of the church. Remarried to Elizabeth. Leased the manor of Kingston Bagpuize to Peter Coke for life in 1367.
Acted as a Member of Parliament for Warwick during the 1350s and 1360s.
Abandoned the de Birmingham's traditional coat of arms and replaced it with:- "partie per pale, indented, or, and gules."
Fulk's tomb lies in St Martin in the Bull Ring.
Sir John (de) Birmingham.
Eldest son of Sir Fulk who served as Sheriff of Warwick in 1397 and as parliamentary representative for Warwickshire, Bedfordshire, and Buckinghamshire.
Married Elizabeth but had no children.
John's tomb (c. 1380) lies in St Martin in the Bull Ring.
Break in direct male line.
Upon Sir John's death, the manor of Birmingham was left to his widow, Elizabeth, to use as a dower. She remarried to Lord Clinton and they lived in the de Birmingham's manor house in Birmingham until Elizabeth's death in 1424.
The rest of Sir John's lands were left to his brother, Sir Thomas de Birmingham, who built his own castle at Worstone near Birmingham. Upon Elizabeth's death Thomas was to have inherited the manor of Birmingham. However, he died before her and the de Birmingham lands were left to Thomas' two granddaughters:-
who were both daughters of Thomas' only daughter, Elizabeth, who had been the wife of Thomas de la Roche.
Lady Ellen Ferrers' inheritance included the manor of Birmingham, which she eventually passed to a second cousin called William de Birmingham.
William (de) Birmingham ?-1479.
Lady Ferrers quit her title in favour of a second cousin, William de Birmingham, who appears to have been a descendant of William de Birmingham, brother of Sir Fulk de Birmingham. He held the manor by military service in 1441 and died in 1479.
Sir William (de) Birmingham 1449-?
Married Isabella, heiress of William Hilton, and they had one son, William, who died before them but not before having his own son Edward.
Edward (de) Birmingham 1497-1538.
According to Sir William Dugdale's "Antiquities of Warwickshire" Edward was the last de Birmingham to hold the lordship of Birmingham. He was cheated out of it by John Dudley, who would later try to place Lady Jane Grey, his own daughter-in-law, on the throne, an offence for which he was later found guilty of treason and sentenced to death.
Dudley had asked to buy Birmingham from Edward. However, proud of his inheritance, Edward declined. Dudley was not a man to take no for answer though and devised a scheme to obtain Birmingham by dishonest means. A trap was laid for Edward and he was framed for highway robbery by Dudley's thugs. He was thrown in the Tower of London, tried and found guilty. However, Dudley being King Edward VI's closest adviser offered to get Edward a pardon from the King. The offer had a string attached, however, and in order to get the pardon, Dudley had to hand Birmingham over to Dudley. Preferring poverty to death Edward did as Dudley demanded and in 1527 retired to obscurity, living on a token ¬£40 a year offered as compensation. Edward had died by 1538 although his widow, Elizabeth, continued to live in Birmingham after his death.
Later de Birminghams.
The lordship of Birmingham was not returned to the de Birmingham family upon Dudley's death. It reverted to the Crown and then to the Marrow family.
Other land held by the de Birminghams does not appear to have been signed over to Dudley and there are records of the de Birmingham's ownership of it after 1527, e.g., Shutford, Oxon in 1544 which mentions a young William, son of Henry, son of William & Margaret de Birmingham.
However, this too appears to have been transferred away from them by Henry VIII, possibly under the advice of John Dudley, who was not executed until 1553.

Con-way Truckload

Headquartered in Joplin, Missouri, Con-way Truckload is a division of Con-way, Inc. offering dry van transportation services using a fleet of long-haul tractors and trailers. Con-way Truckload provides point-to-point, full truckload, dry van service using single drivers as well as two-person driver teams over long-haul routes‚Äîmost commonly with each trailer containing only one customer‚Äôs goods.
History.
Con-way Truckload was founded as Contracted Freightliners, Inc (CFI) in Joplin, Mo. in 1951 by Roy Reed and Ursull Lewellan. The company began with one tractor and two trailers, and generated revenues of $12,000 during its first year.
CFI expanded services into Mexico providing through-trailer service since 1985. The first international office opened in 1987 in Monterrey, Mexico. Just one year later, the first Canadian office opened in Toronto. There are now 37 sales offices and four terminal locations in addition to the headquarters in Joplin, Mo.
Continued and consistent growth led to the expansion of the company‚Äôs headquarters in 1993. The 300-acre site is home to the company‚Äôs administrative offices, maintenance facilities, wash bay, and local driver services.
Equipment upgrades grew as rapidly as office locations. The first 48-foot trailer was purchased in 1986. Just three years later, the first air-ride trailer was delivered. Con-way Truckload, as CFI, was the first carrier to operate a 100% air-ride fleet.
In 2007, Con-way, Inc. determined that to become a viable commercial truckload company, an acquisition would be necessary to augment its existing truckload business which was built to service the needs of Con-way Freight. To meet this need, Con-way, Inc. acquired Contract Freighters, Inc. (CFI), a privately held North American truckload carrier based in Joplin, Missouri, for $750 million. CFI was an industry leader at the time of acquisition, operating over 2,600 tractors and more than 7,000 trailers, with more than 3,000 employees including approximately 2,500 drivers. Previously, Con-way had been CFI‚Äôs largest customer, accounting for six percent of total revenues.
The combination of Con-way Truckload and CFI provided a number of benefits. CFI had been Con-way Freight‚Äôs largest provider of contract service for long-haul transcontinental truckload transportation. CFI had operations in Mexico for more than 20 years and was already one of the largest cross-border truckload carriers. Its capabilities could be combined with Con-way Freight‚Äôs Mexico network and Menlo Worldwide Logistics‚Äôs border-based logistics operations. The acquisition created a business unit with over $500 million in annual revenues for truckload freight.
Operations.
Con-way Truckload operates from five dedicated truckload terminals and 37 sales offices throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico, and accesses many of Con-way Freight‚Äôs more than 365 operating locations.
In 2010 Con-way Truckload introduced DoubleStackTM, an advanced cargo loading and capacity management system which allows shippers to utilize the space in trailers better while securing freight more effectively to prevent shipment damage.
Con-way Truckload provides: Regional Service, Dedicated Service and Doublestack Trailers
Giving Back.
Community Involvement
Con-way Truckload is involved in the community. Every year employees donate time and money for various causes, such as Truckloads of Treasure where company employees participate in a shopping spree benefitting local children, senior citizens, and nonprofit organizations. Local charities are supported at each terminal location.
Stop Distracted Driving
Con-way Truckload participates in the National Distracted Driving Awareness Month in April. The ‚ÄúStop Distracted Driving‚Äù campaign focuses on all types of distracted driving, not just texting or cell phone use.
SmartWay
As a SmartWay Transport Partner since 2005 and recipient of Excellence Awards in 2006, 2007, and 2013. Con-way Truckload continues to exceed the expectations of EPA‚Äôs program. The SmartWay program allows Con-way Truckload to track emission improvement performance and become a working part of the solution rather than contributing to the problem.
Military Support
Con-way Truckload is a participant in the U.S. Department of Labor National Apprenticeship Program, which permits eligible veterans and active members of the Guard and Reserves to receive paid on-the-job training using GI Bill benefits.

Cuvier Press Club

The Cuvier Press Club was a Cincinnati, Ohio social club created in 1911 when the members of the Cuvier Club merged with the members of the Pen and Pencil Club.
From 1911 to 1938, the club was located on Opera Place. In 1938, the club moved to 22 Garfield Place, which would come to be known as the Cuvier Press Club.
Among other activities, the Club held an annual Halloween parade, which was attended by a crowd of approximately 50,000 in downtown Cincinnati, all of whom were presumably unaware of the fear that gripped the nation during the infamous 1938 "War of the Worlds" radio broadcast by Orson Welles.
A 1947 article from the Cincinnati Post includes a note that, during a 2-day time period, the club had experienced the deaths of 3 of its members: William C. Lambert, Stuart Heckerman, and Don G. Gardner.

Con-way Freight

Headquartered in Ann Arbor Charter Township, Michigan, Con-way Freight is a less-than-truckload (LTL) motor carrier utilizing a network of freight service centers to provide regional, inter-regional and transcontinental less-than-truckload freight services throughout North America. The business unit provides day-definite delivery service to manufacturing, industrial and retail customers. Con-way Freight is the largest division of Con-way, Inc. with 16,600 employees, more than 365 operating locations, 16,000 dock doors and 32,750 tractors and trailers. In 2009 Con-way Freight reported revenues of over $2.6 billion.
History.
Con-way Freight originated in May 1983 with the launch of Con-way Western Express, with 11 service centers in three western states, followed one month later by the start of Con-way Central Express, with 11 locations in seven Midwest states. 
Con-way was created to provide nonunion, regional short-haul service in markets where CF wasn‚Äôt actively selling its services. The regional companies Con-way Central Express (CCX), Con-way Western Express (CWX) and Con-way Eastern Express (CEX) were established as part of this strategy. 
On their first day of business the two carriers ‚Äî which collectively began with 230 employees and 334 trucks, tractors and trailers handled 113 shipments.
Operations.
LTL carriers transport freight from multiple shippers utilizing a network of freight service centers, combined with a fleet of linehaul and pickup-and-delivery tractors and trailers. Freight is picked up from customers and consolidated for shipment at the originating service center. The freight is then loaded into trailers and transferred to the destination service center providing service to the delivery area. From the destination service center, the freight is delivered to the customer. Typically, LTL shipments weigh between 150 and 25,000 pounds. In 2008, Con-way Freight‚Äôs average weight per shipment was 1,190 pounds.
Network Re-Engineering.
Following the integration of the three regional component companies of Con-way Freight into a consolidated single network in 2007, the firm completed a major network re-engineering to improve service, without changingCon-way Freight‚Äôs service coverage. 
NTDC Standings.
Con-way Freight has always had a strong presence at the National Truck Driving Championships. In 2010 the company sent a record 92 drivers to the competition and for the past two years Con-way Freight took home the title of Grand Champion. In 2009 Dale Duncan was named Grand Champion while in 2010 Carl Krites took home the title. 
To qualify for U.S. state and national competitions, drivers must have maintained an accident-free driving record for the previous year. At the national competition, drivers face testing in three areas: a timed written exam, a pre-trip inspection test and a driving skills test. Each driver competes in one of nine equipment classes: 3-Axle, 4-Axle, 5-Axle, 5-Axle Flatbed, 5-Axle Sleeper, Step Van, Straight Truck, Tankers and Twins.

<doc id="20558060" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20558060" title="Baritenor">
Baritenor

Baritenor (also rendered in English language sources as bari-tenor or baritenore) is a portmanteau (blend) of the words "baritone" and "tenor". It is used to describe both baritone and tenor voices. In "Webster's Third New International Dictionary" it is defined as "a baritone singing voice with virtually a tenor range". However, the term was defined in several late 19th century and early 20th century music dictionaries, such as "The American History and Encyclopedia of Music", as "a low tenor voice, almost barytone" ["sic"].
In opera.
Baritenor (or its Italian form, "baritenore") is still used today to describe a type of tenor voice which came to particular prominence in Rossini's operas. It is characterized by a dark, weighty lower octave and a ringing upper one but with sufficient agility for coloratura singing. Rossini used this type of voice to portray noble (and usually older), leading characters, often in contrast to the higher, lighter voices of the tenore di grazia or the tenore contraltino who portrayed the young, impetuous lovers. An example of this contrast can be found in his "Otello" (1816), where the role of Otello was written for a baritenore (Andrea Nozzari), while the role of Rodrigo, his young rival for the affections of Desdemona, was written for a tenore di grazia (Giovanni David). Nozzari and David were paired again in Rossini's "Ricciardo e Zoraide" (1818), with a similar contrast in characters ‚Äì Nozzari sang the role of Agorante, King of Nubia, while David portrayed the Christian knight, Ricciardo.
The Italian musicologist, Rodolfo Celletti (d. 2004), proposed that the Rossinian baritenor was nothing new to opera. According to Celletti, the tenor voices used for leading roles in early baroque operas such as Jacopo Peri's "Euridice" (1600) and Claudio Monteverdi's "Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria" (1640) were essentially "baritenor" ones with a range common to both the baritone and tenor voices of today. In his 2009 book, "Tenor: History of a voice", John Potter refers to this type of voice as "tenor-bass" and notes that several virtuoso singers of the 17th century who were described as "tenors" by their contemporaries could also sing in the bass register: Giulio Caccini, Giuseppino Cenci, Giovanni Domenico Puliaschi and Francesco Rasi. Rasi created the title tole in Monteverdi's first opera, "L'Orfeo" (1607), which in modern times has been sung by tenors such as Anthony Rolfe Johnson as well as by lyric baritones, such as Simon Keenlyside. Based on their descriptions in Vincenzo Giustiniani's "Discorso sopra la musica" (1628), Potter has suggested that singers such as Caccini, Cenci, Puliaschi, and Rasi, employed an "open speech-like sound" which facilitated the agility and clarity of expression for which their voices were renowned. 
With the rise of the castrato singer in Italian opera, the baritenor voice came to be perceived as "ordinary" or even "vulgar" and was relegated to portraying character roles ‚Äì villains, grotesques, old men, and even women. Although there were exceptions, such Dario in Vivaldi's "L'incoronazione di Dario" (created by the tenor Annibale Pio Fabri), the leading male roles (and especially that of the romantic lover) in Italian operas of the middle and late baroque era were largely written for the high, exotic voices of the castrati. In French opera of the same period, the baritenor voice, called the "taille" (or "haute-taille") before the term "t√©nor" came into general use, was little used for important solo parts, although possibly more often than in Italian opera. Because of the general dislike for the castrato voice in France, young lover roles were assigned to the high male voices of hautes-contre. Today the "taille" roles are most often performed by baritones.
In vocal pedagogy.
Vocal pedagogues such as Richard Miller use the term to refer to a common voice category in young male singers whose tessitura (most comfortable vocal range) lies between that of a baritone and that of a tenor and whose passage zone lies between C4 and F4. Such singers can evolve, either naturally or through training, into high baritones, suitable for operatic roles such as Pell√©as in "Pell√©as et M√©lisande". Alternatively, they may evolve into spieltenors, suitable for character roles such as Pedrillo in "The Abduction from the Seraglio" or into "heldentenors" who sing leading roles such as Siegmund in "Die Walk√ºre" or Florestan in "Fidelio". In both these types of tenor roles the highest notes of the tenor range are rarely required, and the voice usually has a baritonal weight in the lower notes. Several famous tenors who have sung the dramatic tenor and "heldentenor" repertory originally began their careers as baritones, including Jean de Reszke, Giovanni Zenatello, Renato Zanelli, Lauritz Melchior, Erik Schmedes, and Pl√°cido Domingo, Towards the end of his career, Domingo returned to the baritone repertoire when he sang the title role in "Simon Boccanegra". Self-described as "a bastard bari-tenor", Walter Slezak (the son of operatic tenor Leo Slezak), was primarily a stage and film actor, but he also sang tenor roles in musicals and operettas and appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in 1959 as Zsup√°n in "The Gypsy Baron".
In musical theatre.
Despite being described in "Acting the Song: Performance Skills for the Musical Theatre" as a term "coined" by "musical theatre vernacular", the use of "baritenor" in relation to the operatic voice can be seen in English sources since at least 1835, and French ones since 1829. Nevertheless, the term is widely used in musical theatre to describe a baritone voice capable of singing notes in the tenor range, and was used as early as 1950 to describe the voice of Eddie Fisher in a variety show at New York's Paramount Theatre. Deer and Dal Vera have noted that by 2008, the majority of leading roles in rock musicals were being written for baritenors. Amongst the roles specifying baritenor voices in casting calls between 2008 and 2010 were: Tom Collins ("Rent"), Bob and Tommy ("Jersey Boys"); Wizard, Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow, and Tinman ("The Wiz"); Max Bialystock and Leopold Bloom ("The Producers"); and Thomas Weaver and Alvin Kelby ("The Story of My Life").
Saltzman and D√©si ascribe the rise of the baritenor voice in musical theatre to the introduction of amplification in the second half of the 20th century. Prior to that, the leading roles were predominantly sung by tenors and sopranos with even the baritone characters tending to sing in the upper part of their range. This was due not only to the popular taste of the times, but also to the fact that higher voices were more capable of riding over the orchestra and reaching the furthest seats. The introduction of amplification allowed male leading roles to be assigned to baritones, albeit ones who often had an extension into the tenor range. David Young also notes that the baritenor voice can be particularly useful for roles such as Marius in "Fanny" where the character ages significantly during the course of the musical.

Vermont Route 8A

Vermont Route 8A is a state highway in Windham County, Vermont, United States. It is the northward continuation of Massachusetts' Route 8A, running entirely in the town of Whitingham. The road is numbered as a state route but is maintained by the town of Whitingham as a class-2 town highway. For this reason, it is signed with a black-and-white circular shield; however, one green-and-white shield exists at VT 112's northern end that erroneously denotes VT¬†8A as a state-maintained highway.
Route description.
VT¬†8A begins at the Massachusetts‚ÄìVermont state line as a northern continuation of Route¬†8A-L in the town of Whitingham. VT¬†8A runs north as a two-lane rural highway, crossing through Whitingham, soon gaining the moniker of Stage Road near the junction of McMillan Road. After a short northwestern jog, the route turns north at Burrington Hill Road, passing the rural Fire Fox Road, and turning northeast along the valley. The route soon bends north again, paralleling the East Branch of the North River, entering the town of Halifax. After the town line, VT¬†8A reaches a junction with VT¬†112, which runs north to the community of Jacksonville and south to the Massachusetts state line and Route¬†112.

Miss Cavandish

Miss Cavandish (foaled 1961) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse. Bred by Robert J. Kleberg, Jr. of the renowned King Ranch, she was sired by the 1958 Belmont Stakes winner, Cavan. Her mare was New weapon, a daughter of the 1936 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, Bold Venture.
Considered unlikely to be successful in racing due to a severe "toeing in" problem, she was put up for auction at the September Keeneland Sales. Purchased by Harry S. Nichols for just $1,500, he handed her over to trainer Roger Laurin to see what he could do.
Under Laurin's care, Miss Cavandish raced at age 2, showing her ability when she narrowly lost the Gardenia Stakes. In 1964 the then 3-year-old became one of the top filles racing in the United States, finishing second in the balloting for 1964 American Champion 3-Year-Old Filly honors behind future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Tosmah.
Miss Cavandish was not successful as a broodmare.

The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon

The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon is a painting by Edward Burne-Jones, started in 1881. The massive painting measures 279¬†cm √ó 650¬†cm, and is widely considered to be Burne-Jones's magnum opus.
The painting was originally commissioned from Burne-Jones by his patron George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle, to hang on a wall in the library of Naworth Castle. Howard shared Burne-Jones's affection for the Arthurian legend and left the choice of topic to the artist. Burne-Jones started working on it in 1881 and continued for 17 years. Within this period, he also designed the stage set for the play "King Arthur" by J. Comyns Carr that premiered in London in January 1895.
The 1880s brought the deaths of Burne-Jones's close friends. As they died, the artist experienced mounting isolation and painful awareness of his own mortality. Immersed in his work, Burne-Jones identified himself with Arthur and even adopted Arthur's pose when he himself slept. By 1885, the association with Arthur reached the point where Burne-Jones had to ask Howard to cancel or revise his original commission, replacing the grand scene with a smaller painting focused on the departed king. Howard agreed to cancellation and never requested his downpayment back. Nevertheless, Burne-Jones returned to the original grand painting, and worked on it for the remaining thirteen years of his life. "Arthur" became increasingly autobiographical for the artist as he withdrew into himself; "above all the picture is about silence."
At the floor there is a crown already recognized as the crown of Saint Stephen of Hungary.
A popular opinion holds that Burne-Jones modelled Arthur's appearance after William Morris, the last survivor of a once-strong progressive art circle, and that Morris's physical decline was a major inspiration for the painting. However, Debra Mancoff argues that there is no record of Morris posing as Arthur and that the king's image was completed when Morris was in vigorous health. Morris died in 1896; Burne-Jones lived for two more years and died before the painting was complete. Just one day before his death Burne-Jones continued work on "Arthur". Towards the end of his life he wrote, "I need nothing but my hands and my brain to fashion myself a world to live in that nothing can disturb. In my own land I am king of it." His widow described "Arthur" as a "task of love to which artist put no limit of time or labor."
Following the artist's death, the painting in its frame with Latin inscription passed to a neighbour of Burne-Jones's, whose descendants, John and Penryn Monck, sold the work at auction at Christie's on April 26, 1963 where it was bought by Luis A. Ferr√©, a politician and founder of the Ponce Museum of Art who would later become Governor of Puerto Rico. Burne-Jones was out of fashion at this time so its export was allowed despite some objections.
"The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon" is owned by the Ponce Museum of Art in Puerto Rico. However, it was shown for a short time at the Tate Britain in London while the Ponce museum underwent restoration in 2009-2010.
The painting was on view at the Prado Museum in Madrid: "The Sleeping Beauty. Victorian Painting from The Museo de Arte de Ponce" (February 24, 2009 - May 31, 2009).

Rating scales for depression

A depression rating scale is a psychiatric measuring instrument having descriptive words and phrases that indicate the severity of depression for a time period. When used, an observer may make judgements and rate a person at a specified scale level with respect to identified characteristics. Rather than being used to diagnose depression, a depression rating scale may be used to assign a score to a person's behaviour where that score may be used to determine whether that person should be evaluated more thoroughly for a depressive disorder diagnosis. Several rating scales are used for this purpose.
Scales completed by researchers.
Some depression rating scales are completed by researchers. For example, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale includes 21 questions with between 3 and 5 possible responses which increase in severity. The clinician must choose the possible responses to each question by interviewing the patient and by observing the patient's symptoms. Designed by psychiatrist Max Hamilton in 1960, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale is one of the two most commonly used among those completed by researchers assessing the effects of drug therapy. Alternatively, the Montgomery-√Ösberg Depression Rating Scale has ten items to be completed by researchers assessing the effects of drug therapy and is the other of the two most commonly used among such researchers. Other scale is the Raskin Depression Rating Scale; which rates the severity of the patients symptoms in three areas: verbal reports, behavior, and secondary symptoms of depression.
Scales completed by patients.
The two questions on the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2):
During the past month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
During the past month, have you often been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things?
Some depression rating scales are completed by patients. The Beck Depression Inventory, for example, is a 21-question self-report inventory that covers symptoms such as irritability, fatigue, weight loss, lack of interest in sex, and feelings of guilt, hopelessness or fear of being punished. The scale is completed by patients to identify the presence and severity of symptoms consistent with the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. The Beck Depression Inventory was originally designed by psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck in 1961.
The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is another self-administered scale, but in this case it is used for older patients, and for patients with mild to moderate dementia. Instead of presenting a five-category response set, the GDS questions are answered with a simple "yes" or "no". The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale is similar to the Geriatric Depression Scale in that the answers are preformatted. In the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, there are 20 items: ten positively-worded and ten negatively-worded. Each question is rated on a scale of 1 through 4 based on four possible answers: "a little of the time", "some of the time", "good part of the time", and "most of the time".
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) sets are self-reported depression rating scales. For example, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a self-reported, 9-question version of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders. The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) is a shorter version of the PHQ-9 with two screening questions to assess the presence of a depressed mood and a loss of interest or pleasure in routine activities; a positive response to either question indicates further testing is required.
Scales completed by patients and researchers.
The Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) is completed by the patient and a researcher. This depression rating scale includes a 27-item screening questionnaire and follow-up clinician interview designed to facilitate the diagnosis of common mental disorders in primary care. Its lengthy administration time has limited its clinical usefulness; it has been replaced by the Patient Health Questionnaire.
Usefulness.
Screening programs using rating scales to search for candidates for a more in-depth evaluation have been advocated to improve detection of depression, but there is evidence that they do not improve detection rates, treatment, or outcome. There is also evidence that a consensus on the interpretation of rating scales, in particular the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, is largely missing, leading to misdiagnosis of the severity of a patient's depression. However, there is evidence that portions of rating scales, such as the somatic section of the PHQ-9, can be useful in predicting outcomes for subgroups of patients like coronary heart disease patients.
Copyrighted vs. Public Domain scales.
The Beck Depression Inventory is copyrighted, a fee must be paid for each copy used, and photocopying it is a violation of copyright. There is no evidence that the BDI-II is more valid or reliable than other depression scales, and public domain scales such as the Patient Health Questionnaire ‚Äì Nine Item (PHQ-9) has been studied as a useful tool. Other public domain scales include the Clinically Useful Depression Outcome Scale (CUDOS) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms ‚Äì Self Report 16 Item (QIDS-SR16).

Do You Like Worms?

"Do You Like Worms?" (also known as "Roll Plymouth Rock") is a song written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks in 1966 for The Beach Boys' album "Smile". The original, unfinished recording of "Do You Like Worms?" was first published on "", a boxed set which included much of the unreleased "Smile" material, and then again in 2011 for "The Smile Sessions".
In 2004, Brian Wilson performed a live version of "Smile" with this song under the new title "Roll Plymouth Rock." It deviates from the original Beach Boys arrangement significantly by containing never-before-recorded lyrics and a differently arranged song structure.
The song has been covered by a variety of artists, including The Olivia Tremor Control, Ant-Bee, and Secret Chiefs 3.
Composition.
Lyrics.
"Do You Like Worms?" was imagined as a lyrical journey across the United States from coast to coast; relating mostly to Manifest Destiny and westward expansion. Several couplets were written by Van Dyke Parks in 1966, but only few were ever recorded. Some of these were later resurrected for future re-recordings by Wilson:
<poem>Once upon the Sandwich Islands
The social structure steamed upon Hawaii
Ribbon of concrete / Bicycle Rider ‚Äî just see what you've done, done
To the church of the American Indians</poem>
""Ribbon of concrete"" is likely to be a negative image variant to the lyric ""that ribbon of highway"" from the American folk song "This Land Is Your Land". The ""Bicycle Rider"" lyric has been established as a reference to the traditional standard "See See Rider," but it could also be referencing the "Bicycle Rider Back" playing cards printed by the United States Playing Card Company during the 19th century. One ultimately unused couplet follows:
<poem>And as we returned to the East or West Indies 
We always got them confused
</poem>
Recording.
The song is an extension of the composition "Heroes and Villains", recorded during the "Smile" sessions. "Do You Like Worms?" is in strophic form, following the pattern ABABCB' in mixes prepared by Brian Wilson during "Smile" assemblies. The A sections featured a short instrumental section where the melody is carried by the timpani followed by the lyrics ""rock, rock, roll, Plymouth Rock roll over"" in two-part harmony over the bass guitars. The B section is referred to on tape labels as "Bicycle Rider", and it consists of the repetitive "Heroes and Villains" motif played on harpsichord. At the end of the B' section, the harpsichord breaks down, only to start up again. The C section has Brian singing fake Hawaiian lyrics over backing vocals by the rest of the band and a sparse backing track.
The instrumental tracks for the A and C sections of the song were recorded on , at United Western Recorders. Brian also recorded some of his vocals at that session. The Beach Boys vocals were recorded at Columbia Studios, on December 21, 1966. The B sections of the song were recorded during sessions for "Heroes and Villains".
After a fuzz bass was overdubbed on , "Do You Like Worms?" was abandoned and never worked on again by the Beach Boys. In 2004, Wilson re-recorded the song under the new title "Roll Plymouth Rock" with almost all of its original lyrics. When asked about the name change from "Do You Like Worms?", Wilson explained, "Because we wanted something a little more appropriate, you know? Something that sounded more appropriate."

Alessandro Borgia

Alessandro Borgia (1682, Velletri ‚Äì 1764, Fermo) was an Italian bishop and archbishop.
Life.
From a patrician family of Velletri which was only distantly related to the better known house of Borgia, he was the son of Clemente Erminio Borgia. He studied theology and letters at the "Sapienza" and in 1706 followed Monsignor Bussi to Cologne as secretary to the legation there, succeeding him as nuncio on Bussi's promotion to cardinal in 1712. He remained in northern Europe until 1714, when he was made governor of Assisi, in 1716 becoming bishop of Nocera Umbra. He wanted to go to China as a representative of the Holy See but ‚Äì impressed by the differences arising in the Chinese rites between the Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries and the Chinese emperor he chose to stay in Italy. In 1724 he was made archbishop of Fermo, remaining in that diocese until the end of his life.
A scholar, he was in correspondence with Ludovico Antonio Muratori. Borgia also wrote a history of his birthplace e delle diocesi che ha retto. From 1728 to 1730 he also collected historical documents relating to the history of the Fermo archdiocese, forming the foundation of the diocesan archive of Fermo. Alessandro's nephew Stefano Borgia was put under his guardianship by Stefano's parents when the boy was nine years old, and Alessandro handed down his love of culture to him ‚Äì Stefano edited Alessandro's works after the latter's death and also created the Museo Borgiano in Velletri.

FTCS scheme

In numerical analysis, the FTCS (Forward-Time Central-Space) method is a finite difference method used for numerically solving the heat equation and similar parabolic partial differential equations. It is a first-order method in time, explicit in time, and is conditionally stable when applied to the heat equation. When used as a method for advection equations, or more generally hyperbolic partial differential equation, it is unstable unless artificial viscosity is included. The abbreviation FTCS was first used by Patrick Roache.
The method.
The FTCS method is based on central difference in space and the forward Euler method in time, giving first-order convergence in time and second-order convergence in space. For example, in one dimension, if the partial differential equation is
then, letting formula_2, the forward Euler method is given by:
The function formula_4 must be discretized spatially with a central difference scheme. This is an explicit method which means that, formula_5 can be explicitly computed (no need of solving a system of algebraic equations) if values of formula_6 at previous time level formula_7 are known. FTCS method is computationally inexpensive since the method is explicit.
Illustration: one-dimensional heat equation.
The FTCS method is often applied to diffusion problems. As an example, for 1D heat equation,
the FTCS scheme is given by:
or, letting formula_10:
Stability.
The FTCS method, for one-dimensional equations, is numerically stable if and only if the following condition is satisfied:
The time step formula_13 is subjected to the restriction given by the above stability condition. A major drawback of the method is for problems with large diffusivity the time step restriction can be too severe.
For hyperbolic partial differential equations, the linear test problem is the constant coefficient
advection equation, as opposed to the heat equation (or diffusion equation), which is the correct choice for a parabolic differential equation.
It is well known that for these hyperbolic problems, "any" choice of
formula_14 results in an unstable scheme.

Danny Forster

Daniel K. "Danny" Forster (born September 19, 1977) is an American television host and producer and architect. He is best known as the host of the Science Channel series "Extreme Engineering".
Early life and education.
Forster grew up in Tenafly, New Jersey, with his father, George, a neurologist, and his mother, Alice, a pediatric AIDS and hemophilia clinician. He attended the Elisabeth Morrow School and went on to graduate from the Dwight-Englewood School in 1995, and returned there in 2008 to give the commencement address. He then attended Wesleyan University, graduating with honors in 1999 with a BA in Art and Architectural History. His bachelor's thesis, "Theoretical Realities," studies the impact of computer-aided design (CAD) on the fabrication of form by looking at the work of Peter Eisenman and Frank Gehry.
After college, Forster worked for several years in New York City before moving to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and matriculating at Harvard Graduate School of Design. He received his Master's in Architecture in 2006; his master's thesis invented a vertical urban upward campus whose goal was to create spatial diversity while maintaining homogeneous unit quality.
Forster currently resides in New York City.
Television career.
Forster's television career began in 2005 when he sent in an audition disc to the Discovery Channel in response to a Craigslist ad. Discovery and Powderhouse, a production company based in Somerville, Massachusetts, ultimately hired him to film six episodes of "Extreme Engineering", which was in its third season as a traditional, voiceover-narrated documentary series. According to Joel Olicker, president of Powderhouse, Forster was hired to be the on-camera host on the strength of his "geek chic" and his ability to talk.
Once shooting began, producers were surprised but reportedly not displeased to discover that Forster had a serious fear of heights. Discovery Channel executive producer Julian Hobbs explained, "We didn't want to replace voice-of-God with physical god. We wanted to replace god with human."
Forster said of his "Extreme Engineering" experience, "There was no preparation. Everything was improvised. Mostly I would just walk up to people and say, 'What are you doing? Can I try it?' Then most of the time I would fail at whatever task it was, which adds comic value and also shows how incredibly skilled these workers are."
The new episodes, with Forster as its curious, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable on-camera host, were a success for the Discovery Channel, which subsequently gave Forster his own show, "Build It Bigger". The first season of "Build It Bigger", for which Forster traveled everywhere from New Orleans to Shanghai to Istanbul over the course of a ten-month shoot, aired on the Discovery Channel from July to October 2007. For its second season, beginning in April 2009, "Build It Bigger" moved to the Science Channel, another channel owned by Discovery Communications. "Build It Bigger" quickly became the Science Channel's highest rated show.
In the hiatus between filming season one and season two of "Build It Bigger", Forster filmed a miniseries called "Build it Bigger: Rebuilding Greensburg". The miniseries chronicled the struggle of a small town in Kansas not just to rebuild itself after a devastating tornado, but to reinvent itself as America‚Äôs first LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) platinum-certified, eco-town. "Rebuilding Greensburg" aired in November 2008 on Planet Green, a new Discovery Communications network dedicated to sustainable living. Forster also served as sustainable design correspondent for Planet Green.
In 2008 and 2009, Forster hosted the Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge.
On September 11, 2011, executive producers Forster and Steven Spielberg released on the Discovery Channel the film they made about the reconstruction of Ground Zero: "Rising: Rebuilding Ground Zero."
Architectural career.
During his years at the Graduate School of Design, Forster worked for two summers (2004 and 2005) at Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, an internationally renowned architectural firm in New York City. As Forster has said, "I love doing the show, but I didn't sweat for four years not to be an architect." In 2007, while on the road filming "Build It Bigger", Forster started his own architecture firm, Danny Forster Design Studio. At first restricted to Forster's laptop and an ever-changing "office" of hotel rooms, the firm is now located in Brooklyn, New York, with a full-time staff and ongoing projects in Brooklyn, Manhattan, New Jersey, Chicago, and Michigan.
The firm's inaugural project was the first ever LEED Gold certified home in Northern Michigan, which was completed in 2008. The home, a lake house in Omena, Michigan, has since been featured in the Architectural Review, Architectural Record, and Traverse Magazine.
Academic career.
While filming the second season of "Build It Bigger", Forster began his academic career, returning to the Harvard University Graduate School of Design as a member of the faculty. He taught an upper level graduate architecture studio about sustainable design. The course, entitled "Puntacana: The Modern, the Vernacular, The Sustainable," looked at a resort in the Dominican Republic owned by Oscar De La Renta, Julio Iglesias, and labor lawyer Theodore Kheel, that has been involved in a 30-year effort to develop the island sustainably. The course considered how the resort could organize and develop sustainable housing that would not be predicated on a golf course; the student work will be published in the January 2010 "Archivos de Arquitectura Antillana". Forster taught the course in spring 2010 at the Syracuse University School of Architecture.
Lectures and public appearances.
Since 2006, Forster has lectured nationally and internationally on architecture, education and sustainability to audiences as large as 10,000 and as small as a fifth grade class in Northern New Jersey. Forster was the keynote speaker at the AVEVA International Symposium for Engineering Information Technology (ISEIT) in 2006, delivered executive seminars at The Studley Commercial Real Estate Going Green Conference, and hosted the American Council of Engineering Companies' awards gala in 2007. He was the keynote speaker at the 2008 Solid Works World Expo, the largest 3-D conference in the world. That same year he keynoted Construct 2008, an architecture/engineering conference, and spoke at the Copenmind conference in Copenhagen.

The Norwegian folk music series

The Norwegian folk music series is a scientific collection of traditional Norwegian dance music, divided into two separate series, a hardanger fiddle series, and a regular fiddle series. The Hardanger fiddle series is already published (Hardingfeleverket), and the fiddle series is in production. Together, the two series are meant to represent most, but not all, of Norwegian fiddle music as collected and written down.
The Hardanger fiddle series.
The Hardanger fiddle books were published between 1958 and 1981. The editors were all traditional fiddlers who were well acquainted with the music in question. The three of them, Arne Bj√∏rndal, Truls √òrpen and Eivind Groven, had all collected fiddle tunes in their areas, and were now asked to put their collections into print. As work progressed, √òrpen and Bj√∏rndal both died, and Groven went on alone. Most of the practical edition was carried out by him.
The series consists of seven volumes, with some 2000 tunes all in all, from all the hardanger fiddle areas. The tunes are divided into families, based on musical relation. 
The hardanger fiddle series has not been re-published, but is of great value for research on Norwegian dance music. In the USA, folk music fans regard the books in the same way as the jazz real books. Most of the tunes are now available on the Internet.

Palatine Northern Railway

The Palatine Northern Railway () is a non-electrified single-track main line that connects Neustadt (Weinstr) Hbf with Monsheim in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. It was opened between 1865 and 1873 in three stages. With the replacement of the old Ludwigshafen terminus with the modern Ludwigshafen Hauptbahnhof through station in 1969, Bad D√ºrkheim station became the only station in the form of a terminus in the Palatinate region. Passenger services over the Gr√ºnstadt‚ÄìMonsheim section were discontinued in 1984, but re-established in 1995.
The name of the line comes from the Palatine Northern Railway Company ("Gesellschaft der Pf√§lzischen Nordbahnen"), which acquired the line as its main line in 1870. Its importance lies in the fact that it connects the small towns of Deidesheim, Wachenheim, Bad D√ºrkheim, Freinsheim and Gr√ºnstadt with the railway network.
Route.
The Northern Railway runs through vineyards and open country near the eastern edge of the Palatinate Forest. Starting at Neustadt Hauptbahnhof, it runs to Neustadt-B√∂big station parallel to the Palatine Ludwig Railway, later turning to the left towards the north. After passing the Neustadt suburb of Mu√übach and the small towns of Deidesheim and Wachenheim, the Northern Railway reaches the Bad D√ºrkheim terminual station.
Trains reverse on to the northern branch, which then crosses the Rhine-Haardt Railway to reach Freinsheim at the junction with the line from Frankenthal. A few kilometres north just before reaching Gr√ºnstadt is the former junction with the Leininger Valley Railway, which was finally abandoned in 2005. North of Gr√ºnstadt station, the Eis Valley Railway branches off to Ramsen and Eiswoog. Shortly before Albsheim the largely abandoned Worms‚ÄìGr√ºnstadt railway branches off to Neuoffstein. At Bockenheim is the northern terminus of the German Wine Route and the last town in the Palatinate region. About four and a half kilometres north at Monsheim‚Äîin Rhenish Hesse‚Äîis the terminus of the Rheinhessen Railway.
History.
Planning, building and opening (1860-1873).
In 1860 a local committee was established to promote the construction of a railway from Neustadt via Bad D√ºrkheim to Frankenthal. In particular, the workers in Bad D√ºrkheim‚Äôs factories would benefit from the proposed line. Although such a route would run parallel to the Palatinate Ludwig Railway and the Mainz‚ÄìLudwigshafen railway, the promoters were optimistic that the planned route would be preferred because of its greater scenic appeal.
The committee‚Äôs appeal however, met with little support, as there were fears that it would create difficulties for the Palatine Ludwig Railway Company. For this reason, on 25 January 1862, it was agreed that only a local line would be built between Neustadt and Bad D√ºrkheim. On 22 August 1862, a concession was issued and two months later, the Neustadt‚ÄìD√ºrkheim Railway Company ("Neustadt-D√ºrkheimer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft") was founded, which was intended to operate the route. Construction of the line, however, was delayed since the location of the station at Wachenheim was unclear at first. In addition, the hilly terrain proved to be a hindrance to the construction of the railway and several K√∂nigsbach wine makers continued to oppose the acquisition of their land.
The Neustadt‚ÄìBad Durkheim section opened on 6 May 1865. On 21 March 1873, the Monsheim‚ÄìGr√ºnstadt section was opened. On 20 July 1873, the gap was closed between Bad D√ºrkheim and Gr√ºnstadt. It was decided not to move the station from Bad Durkheim, which for eight years had been end of the line; rather it served from 1873 as a terminal station from both directions. In 1870, the infrastructure of the line was taken over by the Palatine Northern Railway, the Neustadt-D√ºrkheim Railway Company was dissolved at the same time.
