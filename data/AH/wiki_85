Arts Foundation of New Zealand

A facilitator of private philanthropy, the Arts Foundation of New Zealand supports artistic excellence through its permanent Endowment Fund. Legacies and donations help grow the Fund, with income generated enabling the Foundation to support the arts.
The Foundation produces Award programmes that provide recognition and support to artists working at the highest levels in all art forms. By the end of 2010, the Foundation will have honoured 112 artists and distributed $3.65 million to the arts.
Foundation Awards celebrate significant achievement at different stages of artists’ careers and are presented on an annual or biannual basis.
New Zealand’s most senior artists are honoured at the Icon Awards. These Awards recognise a lifetime of achievements and are considered the Foundation’s highest honour. Established artists receive $50,000NZD each in recognition of their achievements and as an investment in their future at the Laureate Awards. Artists who are in the early stages of their career receive $25,000NZD each at the New Generation Awards. In partnership, the Foundation produces the Marti Friedlander Photographic Award, of $25,000NZD to assist the career of a photographer, and the Harriet Friedlander Residency, which is a residency in New York valued at $80,000NZD. In 2011 the inaugural Mallinson Rendel Illustrators Award will be made. This Award will be presented every two years to a children’s book illustrator with published work of a high standard and includes a no-strings cash gift of $10,000. 
Supporters of the arts are also recognised. Every year an individual, couple or trust is honoured with the Award for Patronage and are gifted $20,000NZD by the Foundation to distribute to artists or art projects of their choice. From time to time the Foundation also honours an individual or institution that has contributed significantly to the arts through the Governors’ Award.
Recipients of Awards are selected without their knowing they are under consideration by independent panels of arts peers or curators.
Icon Awards.
The Arts Foundation of New Zealand established the Icon Awards as an honours system to celebrate and acknowledge New Zealand art-makers who have achieved the highest standards of artistic expression.
Limited to a living circle of 20, Icons are pioneers and leaders from all arts disciplines, living and working around the world. To date, a total of 21 artists have been acknowledged as Icons. In 2003, ten artists were honoured, six in 2005 and five in 2007. With the deaths of Janet Frame, Don Selwyn and Hone Tuwhare, the living circle stands at eighteen in 2008.
Each Icon receives a medallion and pin designed by stone sculptor John Edgar. The artist is gifted the pin in perpetuity, while the medallion is presented to a successor at a future Icon Award ceremony following the artist’s death.
In 2008 the Arts Foundation began commissioning oral histories from Icons. In time, the Foundation hopes that an oral history will be deposited with the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington covering the life of each Icon artist. This will ensure the artists’ stories are on public record and available for future generations.
Laureate Awards.
Annually five artists whose careers are in full flight are honoured at the Arts Foundation of New Zealand Laureate Awards.
Artists receive a donation of $50,000NZD each and a specially commissioned sculpture by Terry Stringer. Laureate Artists are New Zealanders practicing in any arts discipline, located anywhere in the world. Laureates are able to use their Award in any way they choose, for example, in the creation of new works, or the freedom to concentrate time and resources into the development of their career.
New Generation Awards.
The Arts Foundation of New Zealand New Generation Awards, celebrate artists’ early achievements through an investment of each recipient’s career. Biennially, five artists are awarded $25,000NZD each,and a sculpture designed by glass artist Christine Cathie. Each artist must have developed an individual identity, demonstrated richness, range and depth, and stand for the strength and quality of their particular art form in New Zealand. Although still at an early stage of career, these artists will have already demonstrated excellence and innovation through an output of high-level artistic work.
Similar to other Arts Foundation Awards, the New Generation Award may be presented to an artist working in any arts discipline. In partnership with the arts community, the Arts Foundation appoints a curator to select artists without their knowing they are under consideration. The curator makes his or her decision by working with a group of self-appointed advisors, travelling and talking to arts experts around the country. Teacher, critic, theorist and organiser of contemporary creative practices, Jon Bywater (Auckland) curated the Award in 2006, while writer, teacher, painter,curator Gregory O'Brien (Wellington) undertook the role in 2008 and arts radio journalist Lynn Freeman in 2010.
Award for Patronage.
The Arts Foundation of New Zealand Award for Patronage is made annually to a person, couple, or private trust for the outstanding private contributions they have made to the arts. The Award for Patronage is presented by Perpetual Trust.
As a community of artists and arts supporters, the Arts Foundation honours those who contribute significantly as patrons. Annually, a donation of $20,000NZD from the Arts Foundation is provided to the recipient of this Award for them to distribute to artists, arts projects or arts organisations of their choice. To date, philanthropists Denis and Verna Adam (2006), Jenny Gibbs (2007), Gillian and Roderick Deane (2008), Adrienne, Lady Stewart (2009) and Gus & Irene Fisher (2010) have been recipients. All recipients have chosen to double the funds for distribution through a matching contribution of $20,000NZD, with Gus & Irene Fisher donating $30,000NZD of their own funds, meaning an annual distribution of up to $50,000NZD. Recipients have also each chosen to distribute an amount of $10,000 each to artists and /or arts projects
Governors' Award.
The Arts Foundation of New Zealand Governors’ Award recognises an individual or institution that has contributed in a significant way to the development of the arts and artists in New Zealand. The recipients are chosen from time to time by Arts Foundation Governors, with each recipient receiving a plaque designed by Auckland artist Jim Wheeler.
To date two Awards have been made:
The inaugural recipient was the University of Otago in recognition of its significant contribution to the arts community through its Burns, Hodgkins and Mozart Fellowships. The three Fellowships were set up through the generosity of anonymous benefactors and have subsequently been funded by additional grants to maintain their value.
The second presentation was made to Concert FM (now Radio New Zealand Concert). The Arts Foundation of New Zealand Governors recognised the significant contribution that Concert FM has made to this country in supporting, encouraging and promoting New Zealand composers, musicians, writers and actors at a national level. The Arts Foundation also acknowledged Concert FM’s contribution to the arts through its recording collaborations and the Douglas Lilburn Prize (a joint initiative between Concert FM and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra).
In 2009 a third presentation was made to the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery, New Plymouth. In making their selection, Arts Foundation Governors acknowledged the singular commitment by the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery to the cause of contemporary art, particularly from Aotearoa New Zealand, over the last four decades.
Marti Friedlander Photographic Award.
The Marti Friedlander Photographic Award, Supported by the Arts Foundation of New Zealand is presented every two years to an established photographer with a record of excellence and the potential to carry on producing work at high levels. The Award includes a donation of $25,000nzd for the photographer to use as they please with the goal of furthering their careers.
The inaugural recipient selected and announced by Marti Friedlander, was Edith Amituanai - a widely exhibited artist and a finalist in a number of awards, including the 2008 Walters Prize. Extended family and immediate community are primary subjects for Edith; she collaborates closely with her Christchurch and Auckland relatives as well as people she grew up with in West Auckland.
John Miller (an independent social documentary photographer, renowned particularly for his protest images) and Mark Adams (a photographer working with subjects of cross-cultural significance) were joint recipients in 2009.
Harriet Friedlander Residency.
On 26 June 2008, the Harriet Friedlander Scholarship Trust and the Arts Foundation launched this new international residency. A dedicated supporter of the arts, Harriet Friedlander also loved the vibrant culture of New York. She believed that any young artist exposed to the city would learn and grow in unimaginable ways with the fruits of this borne out through his or her work. When Michael and Harriet Friedlander and their sons Jason and Daniel designed the residency, Harriet was clear that she did not want to place any expectations or responsibilities on the recipient. An artist was to be sent to New York to have an “experience”, all expenses paid, so that they could immerse themselves in the culture and process it in their own way.
One of the most generous residencies offered to a New Zealand artist, up to $80,000NZD is made available every two years for their travel and living expenses. This opportunity is available to an artist aged 30 to 40, practicing in any discipline. The recipient is selected without their knowing they are under consideration by a curator appointed by the Foundation. The inaugural curator was Gregory O’Brien and the inaugural recipient is filmmaker Florian Habicht, He took up the residency in 2009. Visual artist Seung Yul Oh was selected in 2010 by arts journalist Lynn Freeman. Seung Yul will take up the residency in 2011.

Kaskapau Formation

The Kaskapau Formation is a geological formation in North America whose strata date back to the Late Cretaceous. 
The name derives from "kaskapahtew" (ᑲᐢᑲᐸᐦᑌᐤ), the Cree word for "smoky". It was first described on the banks of the Smoky River, close to the confluence with the Puskwaskau River by F.H. McLearn in 1926.
Geographical distribution.
The formation is thick in the Peace River and Smoky River area, and thickens up to in the foothills of the Northern Rocky Mountains in British Columbia. It is exposed along the Peace River near Dunvegan, as well as in the Smoky River area.
The formation is part of the Smoky River Group, and is conformably overlain by the Bad Heart Formation in the western area, and unconformably by the Cardium Formation in the Pouce Coupe River area. It is conformable underlain by the Dunvegan Formation.
The Kaskapau Formation is equivalent to the Colorado Group shale in central Alberta. It is equivalent to the upper Blackstone Formation, the Cardium Formation, and the Muskiki Formation in the Canadian Rockies foothills in western Alberta.
Lithology.
The Kaskapau Formation is represented mostly by dark grey shale, with sandstone tongues and lentils at the base (Doe Creek Member, Pouce Coupe Member). Thin volcanic ash layers may occur in the British Columbia foothills.
Paleontology.
Oyster fossils are encountered at the base of the formation, and Inoceramus fragments (such as "I. labiatus") are found throughout the entire stack. Ammonites are also present in the sand beds, genus encountered include Dunveganoceras and Watinoceras in the lower part and Scaphites in the upper part.

Gas is produced from the Belly River Formation in the Deep Basin, in west-central Alberta and in the Canadian Rockies foothills.
Paleofauna.
Dinosaur remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation.
Distribution.
The Belly River Formation reaches a maximum thickness of in its western reaches, and thins out eastward to about in the Canadian Plains. It is found throughout southern Alberta, and as far east as eastern Saskatchewan. From south to north, it is present from the United States border to the Wapiti River region, south of the Peace River Country.
Relationship to other units.
The Belly River Formation is conformably overlain by the Bearpaw Formation and gradually overlies the Wapiabi Formation, the Colorado Group shale or the Lea Park Formation shale.

<doc id="20813836" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20813836" title="Foremost Formation">
Foremost Formation

The Foremost Formation is a stratigraphic unit of Late Cretaceous (Campanian) age that underlies much of southern Alberta, Canada. It was named for outcrops in Chin Coulee near the town of Foremost and is known primarily for its dinosaur remains and other fossils.
Geology.
The Foremost Formation is the basal unit of the Belly River Group (also called the Judith River Group). It gradationally overlies the marine shales of the Pakowki Formation. It consists of sediments that were eroded from the mountains to the west and carried northeastward by river systems, where they gradually prograded into the Western Interior Seaway.
The bottom of the formation typically consists of basal sandstones overlain by the interbedded coal seams, carbonaceous shales and mudstones of the Mackay coal zone. The center portion consists of interbedded sandstones, siltstones and mudstones, with minor carbonaceous shales. At the top are the interbedded coal seams, carbonaceous shales and mudstones of the Taber coal zone. The basal sandstones, which are commonly referred to as the Basal Belly River Sand, are a significant hydrocarbon reservoir in some parts of Alberta.
The Foremost Formation outcrops along the Milk, Oldman and Bow Rivers. It is about thick near Lethbridge, thick near Medicine Hat, and thick near Dinosaur Park.
Paleobiota.
Invertebrates.
A variety of insects preserved in amber such as "Haidoterminus" have been recovered from the Foremost Formation at a site near Grassy Lake, Alberta.
The formation also includes a variety of freshwater, brackish water and marine molluscs such as "Ostrea" and "Corbula".
Dinosaurs.
The Foremost Formation has produced a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs than other Late Cretaceous units in the region like the Dinosaur Park Formation, Horseshoe Canyon Formation, and Scollard Formation. This is primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of well-exposed outcrops. The fossils are primarily isolated teeth recovered from vertebrate microfossil sites.

<doc id="20813841" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20813841" title="Vitamin K antagonist">
Vitamin K antagonist

Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are a group of drugs that reduce blood clotting by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase and thus the recycling of vitamin K epoxide back to the active reduced form of vitamin K. These drugs reduce the action of vitamin K by depleting the active form of the vitamin. The term "vitamin K antagonist" is a misnomer, as the drugs don't directly antagonise the action of vitamin K in the pharmacological sense, but rather the recycling of vitamin K. For this reason vitamin K antagonizes the drug's effect (rather than vice versa), and this has led to the loose terminology of vitamin K antagonism.
On the basis of its mechanism of action, the action of this class of anticoagulants in all cases may thus be reversed by administering vitamin K for the duration of the anticoagulant's residence in the body, and the daily dose needed for reversal is the same for all drugs in the class. However, in the case of the second generation "super warfarins" intended to kill warfarin resistant rodents, the time of vitamin K administration may need to be prolonged to months, in order to combat the long residence time of the poison.
The vitamin K antagonists can cause birth defects (teratogens).
Coumarins (4-hydroxycoumarins).
Coumarins (more accurately 4-hydroxycoumarins) are the most commonly used VKA (they are a subset of VKAs), and sometimes the terms are loosely used synonymously (though this also is not quite accurate).
In medicine, the most commonly used VKA is warfarin. The primary mechanism of warfarin is the inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase. The VKAs are not pharmacological antagonists of vitamin K. They are inhibitors of the enzymatic conversion of inactive vitamin K epoxide to its reduced active form. Vitamin K inhibits the overall action of these drugs, but the drugs do not inhibit the direct action of vitamin K. The same dose of vitamin K therefore is antedotal for all the drugs, but may need to be given for a much longer time in the case of drugs that have longer residence times in tissue, as is typical of modern rodenticides.
Warfarin was initially used as a rodenticide, but made the transition to pharmaceutical. Eventually some rodents developed resistance to it. The "second generation" VKAs for dedicated use as rodenticides are sometimes called "super warfarins." These VKAs are enhanced to kill warfarin-resistant rodents. The enhancement to the molecule takes the form of a larger lipophilic group to enhance the fat solubility of the poison and greatly increase the time it acts within the animal's body. However, as described above, the super-warfarins do not inhibit vitamin K and their effect is easily inhibited by vitamin K. Nevertheless, oral vitamin K may need to be given for times that may exceed a month, in order to counter the effect of second-generation VKAs that have very long residence times in the fat of animals and humans.
For a more complete list of VKA's used is pharmaceuticals and rodenticides, see the main article above.
Other VKAs.
Not all VKAs are coumarins. For example, fluindione is a VKA, but not a coumarin. 
Another example is phenindione.
Many of the non-coumarin VKAs are 1,3-indandione derivatives. Nevertheless, all of these molecules share the same mechanism of action, and are inhibitors (antagonists) of vitamin K epoxide reductase, even though loosely called "vitamin K antagonists." The action of all of them may be antagonized by administration of vitamin K.

<doc id="20813845" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20813845" title="St. Mary River Formation">
St. Mary River Formation

The St. Mary River Formation is a geologic formation of Late Cretaceous (Campanian to Maastrichtian) age of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin in southwestern Alberta and northwesternmost Montana. It was first described from outcrops along the St. Mary River by George Mercer Dawson in 1883, and it takes its name from the river.
Fossils from the formation include remains of dinosaurs, as well as mollusc and plant fossils, and trace fossils.
Lithology.
The St. Mary River Formation is generally considered to consist of two units. The lower 30-60 meters (100-200 ft) of the formation was deposited in brackish water environments, and is characterized by fine-grained sandstones, grey shales, coquinoid beds, carbonaceous mudstones and coal beds. The remainder of the formation was deposited in freshwater fluvial and floodplain environments. It is characterized by interbedded sandstone and siltstone, with minor occurrences of carbonaceous shale and coal.
Thickness and Distribution.
The St. Mary River Formation is part of an eastward-thinning wedge of sediments derived from the erosion of the mountains to the west. It is about thick in the in exposures along the Crowsnest and Castle Rivers, and about thick along the Oldman River.
Relationship to Other Units.
The St. Mary River Formation conformably overlies the Blood Reserve Sandstone, or the Bearpaw Formation where the Blood Reserve Sandstone is absent, and it is conformably overlain by the Willow Creek Formation. It extends from Glacier County, Montana to as far north as the Little Bow River in Alberta, where it grades into and intertongues with the contemporaneous strata of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation.
Paleontology.
Molluscs.
Beds of "Ostrea" and "Corbicula" shells are common in the basal, brackish water portion of the formation. The overlying freshwater beds include freshwater and terrestrial molluscs. Shells of Unionidae are common in the fluvial sandstones.
Plants.
Eighteen species of plant leaves were described from the St. Mary River Formation in 1949. More recent work downstream from the St. Mary Reservoir increased the total to at least 32 species. The assemblage includes remains of ferns, "Ginkgo", conifers, a "Trapa"-like plant, and at least six types of large monocot leaves in addition to a sabaloid palm. 
Mammals.
The mammals of the St. Mary River Formation were described by Sloan and Russell in 1974.
Dinosaurs.
Dinosaur tracks.
The St. Mary River Formation has produced relatively few dinosaur fossils from its outcrops in southwestern Alberta. However, footprints and trackways have been found along the St. Mary and Oldman Rivers. More than 100 track-bearing stratigraphic units were documented in one section thick, which is one of the highest densities of track-bearing layers reported from any succession. One footprint from the formation includes the first record of skin impressions from the bottom of a hadrosaur foot.

<doc id="20813846" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20813846" title="Willow Creek Formation">
Willow Creek Formation

The Willow Creek Formation is a stratigraphic unit of Late Cretaceous to Early Paleocene age in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin of southwestern Alberta. It was first described by George Mercer Dawson in 1883 along the Willow Creek, a tributary of the Oldman River. Williams and Dyer defined the type section in 1930 at the mouth of Willow Creek, east of Fort Macleod.
The formation straddles the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary, which divides it into an upper, Early Paleocene member and a lower, Late Cretaceous member. Dinosaur remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the Late Cretaceous portion.
Lithology.
The Willow Creek Formation is composed of non-marine varicolored shales, red beds and sandstones. The shales and red beds include calcite nodules and caliche deposits. The sandstones are soft, light grey, massively bedded and cross-bedded, with harder conglomeratic sandstones toward the base of the formation.
Depositional Environment.
The sediments were eroded from the Canadian Cordillera, and were transported eastward by river systems and deposited in fluvial channel and floodplain environments. The caliche and red beds reflect deposition under arid to semi-arid climate conditions. This contrasts with the equivalent Scollard Formation north of the Bow River, which includes coal deposits indicative of a more humid environment.
Distribution.
The Willow Creek Formation is present in southwestern Alberta, south of the Bow River, and extends a short distance into northern Montana. It thins eastward from the foothills of the Canadian Rockies to its limit east of Vulcan, Alberta. Thicknesses exceeding 1000 meters have been reported.
Relationship to Other Units.
The Willow Creek Formation is overlain by the Porcupine Hills Formation, and underlain by the St. Mary River Formation. It grades into the equivalent Scollard Formation south of the Bow River at about 50° 30’N latitude, and into the Coalspur Formation in the southern foothills. The lower, Late Cretaceous member is correlated with the Frenchman Formation of Saskatchewan, and the upper, Early Paleocene member is correlated with the lower portion of the Ravenscrag Formation.

Wahweap Formation

The Wahweap Formation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is a geological formation in southern Utah and northern Arizona, around the Lake Powell region, whose strata date back to the Late Cretaceous (Campanian stage). Dinosaur remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation.
Paleobiota.
Invertebrates.
The Wahweap Formation shows a substantial amount of invertebrate activity ranging from fossilized insect burrows in petrified logs to various mollusks that characterize the shell beds. Large fossilized crabs are common at most shell bed sites in the Wahweap, and over 1,900 gastropod specimens (of four likely genera) have been unearthed in the formation's siltstone.
Fishes.
In addition to terrestrial vertebrates, freshwater fish fossils have been uncovered from the Wahweap which include bowfin vertebrae, ray teeth, and probable lungfish burrows.
Dinosaurs.
Dinosaurs known from the Wahweap include, at least two different types of hadrosaur, two ceratopsians and at least one theropod. 
Mammals.
A fair number of mammals spanning the lower Campanian are known from the Wahweap as well, including at least 15 genera of multituberculates, cladotherians, marsupials, and placental insectivores.
Trace fossils.
Trace fossils are also relatively abundant in the Wahweap, and include vertebrate tracks as well as burrow activity. Tracks preserved in the capping sandstone indicate the presence of crocodylomorphs, which had been previously known in this area only from teeth elements, as well as ornithischian dinosaurs. At least one possible theropod track has been identified in this area as well.
In 2010 a unique trace fossil from the Wahweap was discovered that indicates a predator-prey relationship between dinosaurs and primitive mammals. The trace fossil includes at least two fossilized mammalian den complexes as well as associated digging grooves presumably caused by a maniraptoran dinosaur. The proximity indicates a case of probable active predation of the burrow inhabitants by the owners of the claw marks.

Woodbine Formation

The Woodbine Formation is a geological formation in east Texas whose strata date back to the Late Cretaceous in the Upper Cenomanian stage. It is the producing formation of the giant East Texas Oil Field (also known as the "Black Giant") from which over 5.42 billion barrels of oil have been produced. The Woodbine overlies the Buda Limestone and underlies the Eagle Ford Formation and Austin Chalk. In some areas, the Woodbine is differentiated into the Lewisville Sandstone, Dexter Sandstone, Maness Shale, and/or Pepper Shale sub-units. The Woodbine and Eagle Ford sand units are collectively referred to as the "Eaglebine" oil and gas play in parts of East Texas.
Dinosaur and crocodilian remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation.
The Woodbine Formation was first mapped and named by Robert T. Hill, known as the "Father of Texas Geology", for the small town of Woodbine, Texas in 1905. The stratigraphic units represent an ancient river system that sprawled across what is the present-day Texas Coastal Plain and into the Western Interior Seaway.
The Arlington Archosaur Site is a location in Arlington, Texas that currently excavates fossils from the Woodbine Formation. It became available to access by the University of Texas-Arlington in spring of 2008. UTA and the Dallas Paleontological Society have excavated at the site up to present day, where work continues.
Other fossils.
Also identified in the formation have been ancient lungfish, fish, turtles, and sharks, as well as coprolites containing bones.

Age.
The ages of the Aguja Formation and its primary fossil-bearing unit, the Upper Shale, are not well understood. Two radiometric dates have been taken from different sections of the upper shale, yielding ages of 72.6 Ma +/- 1.5 Ma old, and 76.9 Ma +/- 1.2 Ma old, respectively. The contact with the overlying Javelina Formation has been estimated at about 70 Ma ago but also as recently as 68.5 million years ago.

Javelina Formation

The Javelina Formation is a geological formation in Texas. Dating has shown that the strata date to the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, approximately 70 to 66.5 million years old. The middle part of the formation has been dated to about 69 million years ago plus or minus 1 Ma and the top situated near the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (in the overlying Black Peaks Formation), dated to 66 Ma ago. Dinosaur remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation.
Age.
The exact age range of the Javelina Formation has been difficult to determine. The Black Peaks Formation, which overlies the Javelina, has often been considered to be Cretaceous-Paleogene in age. However, further study of the uncertain boundary between these two formations has suggested that the boundary roughly corresponds to the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Only one geological site in the Javelina Formation has thus far yielded the correct rock types for radiometric dating. The outcrop, situated in the middle strata of the formation about 90 meters below the K-Pg boundary and within the local range of "Alamosaurus" fossils and below two sites that have yielded "Quetzalcoatlus" fossils, was dated to 69.0 plus or minus 0.9 million years old in 2010.

The Black Peaks Formation is a geological formation in Texas whose strata date back to the Late Cretaceous. Dinosaur remains (from the sauropod "Alamosaurus") have been among the fossils reported from the formation, though the demarcation between this formation and the underlying Javelina Formation is not clear. Some research has suggested that the Javelina/Black Peaks boundary is roughly equivalent to the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary, making the Black Peaks almost entirely Paleocene in age, and meaning the strata the "Alamosaurus" fossils were recovered in actually part of the Javelina formation. However, most studies since 2005 have agreed that the Black Peaks formation straddles the K-Pg boundary, and therefore "Alamosaurus" fossils are indeed present in the lower, Cretaceous portion of the formation. The boundary with the underlying Javelina Formation has been estimated at about 66.5 million years old. The formation preserves the rays "Rhombodus" and "Dasyatis", as well as many gar scales.

The Point Loma Formation is a sedimentary geological formation in Southern California. The strata date back to the Late Cretaceous. The formation is named after Point Loma, California.
Description.
The Point Loma Formation was first described as the middle formation of the Rosario Group by Kennedy and Moore in 1971. Their description is that the lower half is composed of interbedded fine-grained, dusky yellow sandstone and olive-gray clay shale in ledgy graded beds about 20 cm thick, which grades into massive grayish-black siltstone in the top half of the formation.
Fossils.
The formation contains foraminifers, mollusks, and coccoliths. These were used to date the formation biostratigraphically.
Dinosaur remains have been recovered from this formation. In 1967 Brad Riney found a single hadrosaur neck vertebra in a sea cave in La Jolla. In 1983 he found a femur of a hadrosaur in Carlsbad and in 1986 thirteen cervical vertebrae of another hadrosaur. In 1987 Riney discovered teeth and fragments of the postcranium of the ankylosaur "Aletopelta coombsi". In about 1980 Leon Case found the midsection of a right dentary with teeth of a hadrosaur while walking along a beach in San Diego County.

Castle Dome peak, the high point of the range, is a prominent and distinctive landmark. The peak is high, and is located at . Castle Dome was named by American soldiers at old Fort Yuma in the 1880s. Early Spanish explorers called the same peak "Cabeza de Gigante", "Giant's Head." 
History.
Mining.
The Castle Dome mining district is one of Yuma County's oldest and most productive mining locations. Its proximity to the Colorado River and relatively low rates of freight at the time permitted the mining of even low grades of ore which wouldn't have been profitable at other locations. In addition to silver and lead, the area is rich in numerous other minerals, including zinc, copper, gold, and many others. Total production from the Castle Dome mines included of lead, of silver, of zinc, of copper, of gold, and of placer gold production, mostly prior to 1900.
Settlements.
The area was home to the town and mining camp of Castle Dome based around the Castle Dome Mine which first produced silver and later lead. The post office opened in 1875 and closed in 1876. Castle Dome ghost town is now a museum site-(Castle Dome Mines Museum), with twenty or so restored period buildings.
Castle Dome Landing was the port and supply point nearby on the Colorado River. The townsite is now submerged beneath the Imperial Dam reservoir.
Mineral collecting.
The Castle Dome mining district is a popular district for mineral collectors. The region is known for striking combinations of cerussite, fluorite, vanadinite, wulfenite, barite, and mimetite, as well as galenite and anglesite. The Hull Mine and Puzzler Mine in particular have produced atypical green vanadinite and mimetite as well as yellow-hued wulfenite.

The Ferris Formation is a Late Cretaceous (~66 Ma) to Paleocene (66-63 Ma), fluvial-deltaic geological formation in southern Wyoming. It contains a variety of trace and body fossils, preserved in sandy fluvial channel deposits and overbank units. Dinosaur remains are fragmentary, but include Triceratops, Tyrannosaurus, dromaeosaurids, Paronychodon, Ricardoestesia, Edmontosaurus, Edmontonia, Ankylosaurus, and Pachycephalosaurus. 
Some of the fluvial channels contain evidence of tidal influence and brackish water, in the form of tidal facies, shark teeth, and shrimp burrows. This demonstrates that the western shoreline of the Western Interior Sea was still within a few hundred kilometers even during the latest Cretaceous. The local K-T boundary is contained within a sandy channel deposit made up of stacked bars. Reworked Cretaceous fossils are preserved at the base of the channel complex, associated with mud rip-up clasts, and Paleocene mammal fossils are preserved in the upper portion of the bar.
The Ferris Formation is up to 2,000 m thick in the Hanna Basin and represents rapid accumulation of predominantly fine-grained sediment on a broad delta. The delta previously fed the deepwater Lewis Shale and shallow marine Fox Hills Formation. The Ferris followed behind as a system of lagoons, bays, and delta plain environments.

Dinosaurs.
Pasch and May reported that a hadrosaurid was found in the Matanuska Formation. Its discovery heralded the knowledge of a new high-latitude source of dinosaur fossils. This was the first occurrence of a hadrosaur in south-central Alaska, one out of only four vertebrate fossils from the entire Wrangellia Composite Terrane, and the first associated skeleton of an individual dinosaur in Alaska. The carcass appeared to have been deposited in a bathyal or outer shelf environment. Scavenged bones are preserved in soft mudstone while intact bones were presevered in calcareous concretions. Some calcareous concretions may be the result of pieces of meat falling off as the carcass disintegrated. The hadrosaurid was a geographic link between the hadrosaurs of North America and Asia.
The "Talkeetna Mountains Hadrosaur" specimen was discovered in 1994 in a quarry being excavated for road material. That fall, excavation began, and was resumed in the summer of 1996. The specimen is housed at the University of Alaska Museum. The quarry is near the Glenn Highway, approximately 150 miles northeast of Anchorage. The layer consists of dark grey marine mudstone that weathers easily. The mudstone contains highly indurated calcareous concretions and finely disseminated pyrite crystals. Fresh wet surface display horizontal lamina, ripples and evidence of bioturbation. Evidence that these strata have experienced deformation after deposition include "joint sets, faults, secondary deposition of calcite, and degree of induration."
The strata's foraminiferans and mollusks all point to a middle Turonian age for the formation. "Muramotoceras" is an unusual heteromorph previously known only from Japan. It is also middle Turonian. "Eubostrychoceras" is known from Japan, Germany, and Madagascar. "E. japonicum" is Turonian, and likely confined to the middle Turonian. The authors reported teleost tooth and jaw fragments as well as wood fragments from the formation. Other Matanuska fossils include scaphopods, foraminifera, and palynomorphs. The quarry belongs to the lower region of C-1, an informal stratigraphic unit, and Member Four.
The "Talkeetna Mountains Hadrosaur" was a juvenile animal about 3 m (10 feet) long. The bones of the forelimbs with partial manus and ribs have been positively identified, as have most of the tail vertebrae Pelvis and dorsal vertebrae tentatively identified. The specimen could not be distinguished as a hadrosaurid or lambeosaurid. Aspects of its anatomy greatly differed from "Edmontosaurus".
The thin shelled heteromorphic ammonites probably lived at depths 36–183 m. Inoceramids tended to be at upper bathyal and neritic environments. The pyrite around the animal may have been the result of sulfur produced by bacteria consuming the carcass. Invertebrate shells lie parallel to bedding. The high quality of the invertebrate fossils and their lack of any sign of biological action on the part of encrusting or boring invertebrates suggest that there weren't many animals in the environment and only arrive at the location after dying. It is possible that mudslides could have transported the shells to the location, meaning that the preserved collection of species might not represent a specific ecosystem. It may have also been possible for dead ammonites to float long distances. Heteromorphic ammonites probably didn't drift as far due to their potentially benthic mode of life or the septum closing off the living chamber not being calcified and decomposing after death. The most abundant mollusks in the quarry are inoceramids. The ecological context indicates that the "Talkeetna Mountains Hadrosaur" was buried at a depth greater than 35 m.
The skull fell off before the carcass sank. The body came to rest on its left side with limbs extended to the east. About 20% of the hadrosaur's bones were enveloped by calcareous concretions. There were 20 concretions recovered. Every element not found in a concretion bore many closely spaced ovualar conical depressions ranging in diameter from 2.12 to 5.81 mm and 1.64 to 3.62 deep. The depressions are probably bite marks. The depressions are not symmetrical enough for gastropod drill marks and are not shaped like sponge borings. None of the preserved fish fossils of the formation fit the size or geometry of the borings. The size and spacing and shape by contrast resembles closely the teeth of the mosasaur species "Tylosaurus proriger". If the damage to the body had been done prior to being washed out to sea, it likely would have punctured the body, preventing the build up of bloating gases that allowed the carcass to drift out to sea in the first place. The distribution of bite marks corresponds inversely to the presence of flesh in the animal. For instance, lower limb bones sustained the most damage because there was the least amount of flesh shielding the bones at those locations. The concretions formed as the flesh chemically reacted to the seafloor on the largest parts of the animal where the scavenging mosasaur would be unable to fully wrap its jaws around the carcass. Bones pulled free from the carcass were buried in the mud and preserved in mudstone. The organisms occurring with the Talkeetna Mountains hadrosaur fit the description of the second of three types of benthic communities identified by Hogler as forming around large reptile carcasses that would eventually fossilize.

Castle Dome Landing, Arizona

Castle Dome Landing, Arizona (also Castle Dome City) is a ghost town in the Castle Dome Mountains of Yuma County in the U.S. state of Arizona. It was first settled as a transport depot and mining camp around 1863 in what was then the Arizona Territory.
History.
When the first Americans reached the Castle Dome Mountains in the early 1860s, there were already signs of previous mining activity. It was generally held that Native Americans had engaged in mining in the Castle Dome Mountains some years before and backpacked the ore south to a processing site on the banks of the Gila River, where remnants of adobe furnaces were found.
As mineral deposits began to be discovered up and down the Colorado River in the early 1860s, numerous mining camps and steamboat ports grew into towns along the river. Heading north from Yuma, prospectors staked gold and silver claims along the river and in the surrounding mountains. The Castle Dome Mining Company, established in 1863 and owned by Conner and Jacob Snively, purchased many of these claims and planned out the site of Castle Dome Landing on the banks of the Colorado River to act as a shipping point for ore on its way to California for smelting. The Snively's planned only to mine silver in the area, but in that same year, well-known geologist and mining engineer William P. Blake realized that the region's copper-lead ores held extensive value, and lined up investors to develop mining operations in the area.
Though prospecting and planning commenced years earlier, modern mining in the area didn't begin in earnest until 1869 due to hostilities with Native Americans. When the mines finally did begin operations, the mining camp that sprung up was known as Pitoti after a weed thought to be found only in that area. As the area grew, the town was renamed Castle Dome, and a post office was established in that name on December 17, 1875. Less than a year later, however, the post office was discontinued on December 4, 1876.
While the mining camp itself went into decline, the nearby riverside landing established some years earlier began to thrive. The landing, setup for transport of ore and as a supply point for the mines some east of the river, provided a new town site for the region, and was soon established as Castle Dome Landing. The post office re-opened under this new name on August 6, 1878, and the small port became an active supply and shipping depot for the mines in the Castle Dome Mountain mining district. For the next six years, Castle Dome Landing served as the first stop for steamboats traveling up the Colorado River from Yuma, and the town thrived, both as a supply and shipping point and as a popular destination for travelers from Yuma who came up the Colorado River for various celebrations held at the numerous river towns. For Castle Dome Landing, Mexican Independence Day on September 16 was the main draw.
By some accounts, the population of the town peaked at over 3,000 people, and rivaled Yuma in size as of 1880, almost becoming Yuma County's namesake. Other sources put the full-time residents at only 50. At its peak, it housed a post office, a hotel, a saloon, a general store, and smelting facilities.
Decline.
As with many mining boomtowns, mining activity diminished, and the Castle Dome Landing post office closed down on June 16, 1884. The mines reopened in 1890, and the area became a significant source of lead for both World War I and World War II. In particular, when the Arizona Lead Company reopened the mines in 1943, they were able to produce significant amounts of lead in order to meet wartime demands.
After World War II, the demand for lead decreased, and the town again went into decline, though mining activity continued for some years in the area. The school was shut down in 1950, and the mines went into and out of use as the price of silver, still found in the area, rose and fell. By 1978, the mines were all shut down, and the last of the residents were gone.
Remnants.
The remains of Castle Dome Landing, once on the banks of the Colorado River, are now submerged beneath the Imperial Dam reservoir in Martinez Lake. The property that was previously Castle Dome town and mining camp was purchased in 1994 by Allen and Stephanie Armstrong, and turned into the Castle Dome Mines Museum. The museum site houses 23 restored and recreated buildings — seven original to the town, and the rest are period representations built mostly from locally scavenged materials. Each building, among them a saloon, a hotel, a mill, and a blacksmith, is staged to look like it might have looked in the town's heyday, some 100 years ago.
Mining.
Though silver was the original target for prospectors in the area, much of the early excitement over supposed silver deposits turned out to be veins of galena instead. As it turned out, the area was far more rich with lead ore than silver.
The Castle Dome mining district is one of Yuma County's oldest and most productive mining locations. Its proximity to the Colorado River and relatively low rates of freight at the time permitted the mining of even low grades of ore which wouldn't have been profitable at other locations. In addition to silver and lead, the area is rich in numerous other minerals, including zinc, copper, gold, and many others. Total production from the Castle Dome mines included of lead, of silver, of zinc, of copper, of gold, and of placer gold production, mostly prior to 1900.
The Castle Dome mining district is a popular district for mineral collectors. The region is known for striking combinations of cerussite, fluorite, vanadinite, wulfenite, barite, and mimetite, as well as galenite and anglesite. The Hull Mine and Puzzler Mine in particular have produced atypical green vanadinite and mimetite as well as yellow-hued wulfenite.
Geography.
Castle Dome Landing, now submerged, is located at (32.9650409, -114.4635592) about north of Yuma.
The original Castle Dome town and mining camp, now the site of the Castle Dome Mines Museum, is located at , in close proximity to the Castle Dome Mine, located at .

Maastricht Formation

The Maastricht Formation (Dutch: "Formatie van Maastricht"; abbreviation: MMa), named after the city of Maastricht, the Netherlands, is a geological formation in the Netherlands and Belgium whose strata date back to the Late Cretaceous, within 500k years of the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, now dated at . The formation is part of the Chalk Group and is between 30 and 90 metres thick. It crops out in southern parts of Dutch and Belgian Limburg and adjacent areas in Germany. It can be found in the subsurface of northern Belgium and southeastern Netherlands, especially in the Campine Basin and Roer Valley Graben. Dinosaur remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation.
Lithology.
The Maastricht Formation consists of soft, sandy shallow marine limestone (in Limburg locally called "mergel"), in fact chalk and calcareous arenite. These lithologies locally alternate with thin bands of marl or clay. The lower parts of the formation contain flint concretions. The upper parts can have shellrich layers. Its age is between about 70 and 66 million years, which puts it in the Maastrichtian, a stage that was named after the formation. The top of the formation can possibly be Danian (early Paleocene) in age.
The type locality is at the ruins of Lichtenberg castle on the Sint-Pietersberg, Maastricht.
Stratigraphy.
The Maastricht Formation was first described by Belgian geologist André Dumont in 1849. The formation is subdivided in seven members, from top to bottom these are the Meerssen Member, Nekum Member, Emael Member, Schiepersberg Member, Gronsveld Member, Valkenburg Member and Kunrade Member. The members are often hard to distinguish.
The Maastricht Formation is overlain by the Paleocene Houthem Formation and was deposited on top of the older Gulpen Formation.

West Germany (performing under the banner Germany) was present at the Eurovision Song Contest 1975, held in Stockholm, Sweden.
The German national final to select their entry, "Vorentscheid 1975: Ein Lied für Stockholm", was held on 3 February at the Hessischer Rundfunk Studio 1 in Frankfurt am Main, and was hosted by journalist Karin Tietze-Ludwig, already well known for hosting the international preview "Auftakt für Brighton" a year before.
Fifteen songs made it to the national final, which was broadcast by Hessischer Rundfunk to ARD broadcasters across West Germany. The winner was decided by nine regional juries with four members each. Each jury member would assign points 1 to 5 for their five favorite songs. The highest score a song could possibly receive (with every jury member from every region voting 5 on one song) was 180.
The winning entry was "Ein Lied kann eine Brücke sein," performed by Joy Fleming and composed by Reiner Pietsch with lyrics by Michael Holm. Other notable competitors included 1971 Contest winner Séverine, two-time German representative Katja Ebstein, past German representative Mary Roos, and Peggy March, well known in Germany and briefly in the U.S. for the song "I Will Follow Him."

America 500 Years

America 500 Years is the title of a series of paintings created in 1988-91 by Nabil Kanso in commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America. The works in the series base their subjects on historical events in the Americas over the course of five centuries.
Description.
"America 500 Years" series of paintings comprise a wide range of works including 9 mural-scale paintings executed in oil applied in rhythmic succession of vigorous brushwork infusing patterns and textures of varying density with intense tones of predominantly blue-black figures set against a combination of orange, red, and yellow ground. 
The compositions divide the canvas space into distinct sections within a planar layout constituting the basis for constructing a scene of separate parts offering variations of viewpoints in their contrast between subject matter and technique. The pictorial organization conveys a volumetric presence of highly condensed images in juxtaposed planes expanding their irregular shaped boundaries near the top of the canvas. The relation between them is important for an overall understanding of the picture and its meaning.
Paintings in the series.
1 - Discovery measuring 3.65 meters (12 ft tall) and 4.50 meters (14 ft) wide depicts the first landing of Christopher Columbus in the New World in a scene divided in two parts corresponding to two worlds, one posed by the arrival of Columbus, the other inhabited by natives. 
At the forefront of the right section stands a figure representing Columbus with a fierce look resting one hand on his sword, the other raising the cross. A silhouetted figure rises behind him with one arm raised and one stretched toward two sails above an assemblage of figures and objects that include a rearing horse, a figure in body armor, a mariner's compass, gunpowder and cannons alluding to some of the equipments and instruments brought by Columbus.
The left part depicts an eagle and a group of figures that may represent the Taíno or Arawak natives, referred by Columbus as Indians.
2 - Encounter 3.65 X 5.50 meters (12 X 18 ft) depicts a scene reflecting the encounter between Hernán Cortés, the Spanish conquistador and Montezuma, ruler of the Aztec empire. The scene entails two sections separated by a V-shaped space formed by the intersecting fall of a figure warrior and an eagle as a metaphor for the Aztec fallen eagle.
The right plane shows a dominant figure personating Cortés with a steering look reaching for his sword drawn over two struggling figures. He leans backward upon a female figure representing his interpreter and mistress known as la Malinche. The upper area shows a screaming figure with wide-flung arms arching a wild-looking horse above the figures of a priest and a soldier.
The left section depicts a figure representing Montezuma holding a flower necklace. His posture orients a triangular shaped plane fitted with a group of figures, a Serpent and objects with symbolic forms.
3 - Covenant 3.65 X 5.50 meters (12 X 18 ft) depicts a scene based on the subject of the arrival in America of the early settlers known as the Pilgrims who wrote the governing Compact aboard the Mayflower ship that landed at Plymouth. 
The painting's two sections are parted at the top center by a red-yellow sun amid a whirlwind of pendulous shaped forms extending themselves over the entire picture surface.
At the top right side, dripping lines around the sun seem to give shape to the sail of a ship and overlap three joined figures that may refer to the signatories of the Covenant. Below them are thrusting figures reflecting natives appear with offerings such as plants and staples. The lower forefront shows a clergyman above a female figure leaning backward and holding in her hand a torched broom in flame alluding to the Salem witch trials.
4 - Birth 1776 (3.65 X 5.50 meters) depicts a scene on the American Revolution and Independence in a composition that divides the canvas in two parts linked at the center by a massive tree extending its branches in all directions scattering a wild assortment of shapes suggesting "organic cells that seem to subdivide and float around the figures." A fearless eagle sits at the top against a background of red and white stripes reflecting the American flag in a space dotted with stars and an image of the Liberty Bell. The area along the sides of the tree trunk shows the faces of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.
The left and right sections are linked by the tree trunk in establishing a unified base line projecting forms of muskets and rifles.< 
5 - Branching (3.65 X 5.50 meters), continues the motif of the tree in "Birth 1776" with a tripartite scene on the war of liberation and independence in Latin America depicting a "ponderous tree-trunk that builds a pathway" throughout the picture. The structured planes are surrounded by light bluish space containing forms reflecting the faces of Simón Bolívar, José de San Martín, Antonio Sucre, Francisco de Miranda, Miguel Hidalgo, and José Morelos.
6 - Chains Under a Blinding Sun (3 X 5.50 meters) is based on the subject of slavery depicting a three-part scene reflecting dark blue figures within a compressed space of deep yellow planes under a partial view of a hazy sun.
Long pendulous shapes with circumventing rings emerge from both sides and converge at the center with dripping lines over chained and struggling figures and symbols of enslavement, hanging, lynching, and torture.
7 - Bleeding Eagles (3 x 5.50 meters) bases its subject on Native Americans with a scene imparting various allusions, symbolism and contrasting elements. The composition sets intense dark blue figures inside two fire-red rectangular planes whose upper parts recede outward creating a wide V-shaped central section dominated by two fighting eagles. They span their wings in a crisscross formation scattering flying feathers over a grey-white space defined by bluish flowing forms outlining drawn faces of native chiefs Pontiac, Joseph, Cochise, Crazy Horse, Black Hawk, Red Cloud, and Sitting Bull.
Above the chiefs’ heads and across the upper plane, sweeping shapes of red strips with black-blue contours fuse with flowing lines of varying densities. They appear dripping over the entire image highlighting the movement and tension of the scene.
8 - North-South Split (3.65 X 5.50) meters deals with the subject of the American Civil War in a scene composed in three sections demarcated at the edges by a white-bluish space that seems to widen around the upper middle part with floating forms outlining on one side the face of Abraham Lincoln, and on the other, the faces of Robert E Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Their heads are turned toward the central image showing a female figure diving over a child falling between two opposing figures that personify the fighting between the Confederate and Union armies.
The right side plane is occupied by dark-blue figures surrounded by circular forms of chains breaking and loosening within the organism of a compressed space. 
The left side shows figures, elements, and symbols reflecting some events that may allude to the Mexican American War.
9 - Glimmering Dawn (3.65 X 5.50 meters) depicts a three-part composition with an atmospheric evocation of the twentieth century. It is suggested that "the attitudes and motions of the figures and forms appear defined by webs of fire-lit strings" descending from different directions with a focus at the top of the central section occupied by an umbrella shaped sphere conjuring the threat of an atomic explosion. White-blue strips flowing with figure forms surround the three sections.

Compak Sporting

Compak Sporting is a sporting, shooting activity involving clay pigeon shooting based on Sporting Clays. The name Compak Sporting is a protected, registered trademark with sports rules, owned by F.I.T.A.S.C. - Fédération Internationale de Tir aux Armes Sportives De Chasse
This game is a variation of Sporting Clays.
The Game Described.
As the name suggests, Compak Sporting is a "compacted" game of Sporting Clays, Let's look at Sporting Clays first - this is a shotgun sport usually spread over 12 to 36 stations (shooting areas) occupying around , presenting 2 or 3 different clay target s at each. One shooter will shoot the targets, followed by the next and so on. With Compak Sporting the space requirement is considerably less, and a squad of up to 6 shotgun shooters, (5 actively shooting), will stand in a straight line, each on a marked square (1 meter by 1 meter) and spaced 3 to 5 meters apart (i.e. the shooting line will be 12 to 20 meters long). In front of them will be the "target area". This is a rectangle 40 meters wide by 25 meters deep and positioned 4 to 5 meters in front of the line of shooters. (If the shooters are numbered 1 to 5, the rectangle will be centered on shooter 3) 
The target area should be marked with four flags defining the four corners. Clay target s will be thrown by clay pigeon trap machines, of which there must be a minimum of 6. Every target thrown must pass over at least one side of the 40 x 25 meter rectangle. E.G. A target can be thrown from outside the rectangle and land inside, it can be thrown from inside the rectangle and land outside, it can be thrown from inside the rectangle and land inside (e.g. a Teal shot)or it can be thrown across both sides i.e. thrown from outside the rectangle and landing outside the rectangle but crossing some part of the rectangle during its flight. Shooters take turns shooting the various targets - these can be single targets or double targets (instant pair or report pair). Targets are released on a random time delay (0 – 3 seconds) after the shooter's call. There are numerous rules defining compulsory targets, traps, triggering systems, shooting stands, targets, trajectory-setting-tables, guns, ammunition etc. The full rules can be downloaded from FITASC Compak Rules
Some History.
For more information on how this sport originated see A HISTORY of Compak Sporting.
Variations of the Game.
Although Compak Sporting is an International shooting game with FITASC Defined Rules, there are many variations (prior to Compak Sporting) with designers using imaginative settings to play similar games. As mentioned in "History" above, Compak Sporting developed from the earlier Compact Sporting games. For a limited shooting area, Compact Sporting can provide a selection of various targets all shot from one "station". Sometimes called "Lazy man's Sporting Clays", a Compact Sporting layout can give a wide variety of target presentations without having to walk around a Sporting Clays Course. One advantage of Compact Sporting is that the game can be played / shot from under cover. Samples of covered decks show how to design a covered, sheltered facility where the game can be played in even the worst of weather conditions. Whereas Compak Sporting requires a minimum of 6 clay pigeon trap machines, it is not unusual for Compact Sporting games to use up to 15 trap machines. With the correct design, a covered Compact Sporting deck or platform can be used to host Compak Sporting Regulated Shooting Competitions.

Engine Sentai Go-onger vs. Gekiranger

Plot.
The story begins when Geki Red battles Nunchaku Banki after returning from his trip around the world for Natsume's birthday, with Geki Yellow and Geki Blue arriving to provide backup. After sending the Gekirangers into another dimension, the Go-ongers arrive before the Savage Machine Beast departs after his quarry. After clearing a misunderstanding with Geki Violet and Geki Chopper, the two bring them to SCRTC to see Master Xia Fu, with Hant revealing he met Miki at one of his past jobs at the Kyoryuya Curry Shop. After taking Xia Fu to the site, realizing the Gaiark are after Dōkokugan, he opens the path for them to follow as the Gekirangers are overwhelmed by Nunchaku Banki, who demands the sealed Long from Jyan. After the Gekirangers' reunion and meeting the Go-ongers, they take out the Ugats and overwhelm Nunchaku Banki. In retaliation, he steals the Engine Souls as the Pollution Ministers arrive with the mastermind of their scheme, Meka, who reveals himself as the last of Rinjū Hall's fighters. Using the Engine Souls as his hostages, Meka tricks Jyan in giving up the Dōkokugan to save the Engine Souls before sending the Rangers back to their world. As Meka pounds the Dōkokugan into an Engine Soul that is implanted into Nunchaku Banki, the Gekirangers attempt to teach the Go-ongers the ways of the Gekijūken style. Nunchaku Banki arrives to test his new-found power with Meka overseeing it to take in the suffering. The Go-on Wings arrive to take the two trouble makers out of the city before fighting them with what they learned from Gorie.
Although he was unable to endure Jyan's teachings, Go-on Red runs to Hiroto and Miu's aid as he battles Nunchaku Banki and gets Speedor back with his newly acquired Engine Ken. After mastering their own Engine Ken style, the other Go-ongers arrive to support Go-on Red and Geki Red while getting back their Engine Souls. After scrapping Nunchaku Banki, the Pollution Ministers retreat to have Meka fend for himself. However, Long breaks from his seal, discarding his robot vessel with intent to get his revenge to be completely free. However, the Go-on Wings arrive with the resurrected Rio and Mele to turn the tables as Long converts Nunchaku Banki into a new form for him in inhabit, Long Banki. While the reds and Rio battle Long Banki, Mere and the Go-on Wings deal with Meka before the teams use a Super-Super Special combo on them. Although Meka is destroyed, Long Banki enlarges with Engine-Oh G9 and Geki Rin Tohja Wolf fighting him; Bae would return all the way from India to give commentary. Although the teams are initially overpowered by the immortal, Engine-Oh G12 and Saidai Geki Rin Tohja are formed and manage to destroy Long Banki with Long resealed. After giving the Dōkokugan back to Jyan, Rio and Mele depart for purgatory, with Rio telling Jyan he hasn't forgotten his promise. The movie ends with both teams throwing a birthday party for Natsume later that night.
Characters.
New characters for the film are , an engineer and last surviving Beast-Man of the Rin Jū Hall, and , a Barbaric Machine Beast created by Meka who has the powers of the Akugata and the Gaiark.

1926 Imperial Conference

The 1926 Imperial Conference was the seventh Imperial Conference bringing together the prime ministers of the dominions of the British Empire. It was held in London from 19 October to 22 November 1926. The conference was notable for producing the Balfour Declaration, which established the principle that the dominions are all equal in status, and "autonomous communities within the British Empire" not subordinate to the United Kingdom. The term "Commonwealth" was officially adopted to describe the community.
The conference was arranged to follow directly after the 1926 Assembly of the League of Nations (in Geneva, Switzerland), to reduce the amount of travelling required for the dominions' representatives.
The conference created the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee, chaired by Arthur Balfour, to look into future constitutional arrangements for the Commonwealth. In the end, the committee rejected the idea of a codified constitution, as espoused by South Africa's former Prime Minister Jan Smuts, but also fell short of endorsing the 'end of empire' espoused by Smuts's arch-rival, Barry Hertzog. The recommendations were adopted unanimously by the conference on 15 November, followed by an equally warm reception in the newspapers.
Participants.
The conference was hosted by King-Emperor George V, with his Prime Ministers and members of their respective cabinets:

Charles François de Riffardeau, marquis de Rivière

Charles François de Riffardeau, marquis, then duc de Rivière (Ferté-sur-Cher, 17 December 1763 — 1828) was French ambassador to the Sublime Porte of the Ottoman Empire, 1815–1821, for which service he was made "duc" in 1825. He played a role in getting the Venus de Milo for the Musée du Louvre.
Rivière joined the Guards at the age of seventeen. He fled at the opening of the French Revolution with the first wave of émigrés headed by Louis XVI's brother, the comte d'Artois, later Charles X, whom he followed as aide de camp to London with "a degree of superabundant loyal zeal". The comte d'Artois entrusted him with several missions to Brittany and the Vendée. In the time of Napoleon he returned to France with Charles Pichegru in 1804 and was implicated in the conspiracy against the Emperor's life headed by Georges Cadoudal; though Rivière was sentenced to death, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and he was interned at Fort de Joux. He was not released until the Bourbon Restoration, when Louis XVIII made him a Peer of France and appointed him ambassador to the Ottoman court. On his return to France he was made Captain of the Guards to Charles X, was made a duke in 1825, and became tutor to the duc de Bordeaux in March 1826.
The series of lithographed "Vues de Londres" (Paris, 1862) were executed by his son, also Charles François de Riffardeau, duc de Rivière.
The "Mémoires posthumes, lettres et pièces authentiques touchant la vie et la moirt de Charles François, duc de Rivière", edited by Joseph Jacques, vicomte de Naylies, was published in Paris, 1829.

The Pseudomonas exotoxin (or exotoxin A) is an exotoxin produced by "Pseudomonas aeruginosa".
It inhibits elongation factor-2. It does so by ADP-ribosylation of EF2. This then causes the elongation of polypeptides to cease.(The mechanism of the toxin is similar to that of Diphtheria toxin.)
It has been investigated as a treatment for hepatitis B.

Surfers Paradise Baseball Club

The Surfers Paradise Baseball Club is a baseball club based on the Gold Coast in Queensland, that participates in the Greater Brisbane League, Gold Coast and Far North Coast competitions. The club was also host of the 2008 Pan Pacific Masters Games.
History.
John Carpenter, Mitch Wikum and Steve Meeham founded Surfers Paradise Baseball Club in 1987. That year the club entered three teams in the Brisbane metropolitan competition, and in their first season won the A-Grade title. This was achieved through the assistance of ex-Claxton Shield players from other states including: Larry Montgomery (NSW), Gary Coward (SA), Lance Wegner (VIC), as well as other quality players from around the Gold Coast and Brisbane region.
The idea for a junior competition on the Gold Coast, or at least Surfers Paradise, was initiated by Steve Meeham who advertised in the local paper for junior players. With mixed responses from players of all age groups, the competition attracted 60 kids between the ages of 10 and 14 years plus one father - Gary Edwards. With Gary’s help, Steve split up the children into 5 equal sides, and rolled out a competition on Saturday mornings.
The five junior sides - Giants, Dodgers, Dragons, Reds and Sharks – attracted great success in the ‘88 to ‘89 season, and by the ‘89 to ‘90 season the number of kids playing baseball at Surfers Paradise had doubled. By the start of the ‘90 to ‘91 season, there was an abundance of young players with not enough coaches to manage them so the competition was forced to expand and teams were created in the areas where the kids lived such as Runaway Bay, Nerang and Palm Beach.
The first junior representative players to come from Surfers Paradise were Brandon Pollard, Trent Durrington, Shane Edwards and Adam Wardrop. All four boys were selected in the QLD U/16's squad in 1990 with each of them progressing to more senior representative teams over the years including National and Junior selection, as well as Australian Senior team selection for Trent and Brandon. Trent now runs a Training With the Pro's program out of the club every year in December.
On 21 December 2008 the team played in the Commissioners Cup at the Beenleigh Hawks baseball club and lost to the shield's incumbent, the Redcliffe Padres 4-3.

USC&amp;GS Pioneer (1929)

USC&GS "Pioneer" was a survey ship that served in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1941 to 1942. She was the second ship of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to bear the name.
Early Years and initial U.S. Navy service.
"Pioneer" was completed in 1929 by Germaniawerft at Kiel, Germany, as the private yacht "Haida". The United States Navy purchased "Haida" in 1940, modified her for naval use, and commissioned her as patrol yacht USS "Argus" (PY-14) in 1941.
United States Coast and Geodetic Survey career.
The U.S. Navy decommissioned "Argus" later in 1941 and loaned her to the Coast and Geodetic Survey for use as a survey ship. The Coast and Geodetic Survey modified her for her new role, renamed her "Pioneer", and placed her in service on 17 September 1941.
"Pioneer" was able to accomplish little survey work before the entry of the United States into World War II led to her return to the U.S. Navy on 16 March 1942 under Executive Order 9072 of 24 February 1942.
Later career.
The U.S. Navy recommissioned the ship, again as patrol yacht USS "Argus" (PY-14), in April 1942, and she remained in commission until 1946, spending most of her naval career patrolling San Francisco Bay. She was sold for use as the private yacht "Sarina" in 1946, then again in 1981, becoming the charter yacht "Rosenkavalier", and again in 2000, becoming the yacht "Haida G." Restored to the appearance of the original "Haida" of 1929, "Haida G." remains in service today.

David A. Wallace

"David A. Wallace, FAICP, AIA, PP" (1917 – July 19, 2004) was an influential urban planner and architect who founded the firm of Wallace Roberts & Todd (WRT) with Ian McHarg.
In a career that spanned the second half of the 20th Century, David A. Wallace contributed significantly to the fields of planning and urban design as a professional, as a builder of communities, and as a teacher. His accomplishments in planning serve as models for the profession. Beginning in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1953, under Mayor Joseph S. Clark, Wallace led a citywide urban redevelopment evaluation that resulted in the "Central Urban Renewal Area Report" (CURA). In it he established a new strategy for overall redevelopment that targeted catalytic actions to strengthen communities and downtown. CURA became a model for several other cities, notably Baltimore, Maryland.
Urban development career.
In 1957, Wallace moved to the City of Baltimore, in Maryland and headed a team to prepare a plan for the city's ailing central business district, which had not had any major skyscrapers or substantial new construction since the end of the "Roaring 20's". Responding to the need for immediate action, the team designed the Charles Center, a 33 acre mixed-use project that started the revitalization. Approved by the Baltimore City voters in a bond issue request for $25 million in the municipal elections of November 1958, the concept was strongly supported by two different strong mayors of the city from both political parties: Democrat (from Baltimore's long-standing political dominating machine) Thomas L. J. D'Alesandro, Jr. (1947-1959) and Republican (long a city out-voted minority) Theodore Roosevelt McKeldin, (1943-1947 and 1963-1967). Along with business, commercial and other civic leaders in the Greater Baltimore Committee and the Baltimore Chamber of Commerce. Praised by Jane Jacobs in the journal ""Architectural Forum"" as the "New Heart for Downtown Baltimore", Charles Center also set the stage for Baltimore's later even more famous "Inner Harbor". This re-development of its old waterfront district at Pratt and Light Streets along the former "Basin" at the head of the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River and the Baltimore Harbor, which had gotten shallower over the decades with outdated municipal piers with the larger cargo ships being unable to turn around or use the new containers for bulk cargo that were then coming into vogue. Some newer port facilities had already moved further southeast to the lower river (such as the "Dundalk Marine Terminal" and later "Sea-Girt Terminal") with the new-style of roll-on and roll-off handling of automobiles and large overhead cranes to load and unload ever more larger ships, moored to the side of the docks like cars doing "parallel parking", replacing the old type of "break-cargo", handled by rope nets and using large numbers of stevedores and longshoremen.
Wallace returned to Philadelphia to teach at the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Fine Arts (now known as the School of Design since 2003 or "PennDesign") as professor of planning and urban design. In 1963, he co-authored with the noted Ian L. McHarg, the benchmark ""Plan for the Green Spring and Worthington Valleys,"" the a pleasant semi-rural area of rolling hills and Maryland's famed "horse country" northwest of Baltimore in the surrounding growing suburban Baltimore County. The key idea in the Valleys Plan was the preservation of the valleys as largely undeveloped open space, and the diversion of development to the surrounding plateaus and to the east of the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway (Interstate 83) which led north to Pennsylvania and the area of Hunt Valley. Lewis Mumford cited the plan as "brilliantly conceived… a most important contribution to regional planning." McHarg republished the plan as a chapter in his seminal book ""Design with Nature"" and wrote in his autobiography, ""A Quest for Life"", By the 1970s, Wallace was, indisputably, the dominant city planner in the United States." The valleys northwest of Baltimore remain open and generally rural to this day.
Inner Harbor Plan.
When Wallace received the assignment to prepare the later "Inner Harbor Master Plan", also in 1963, he asked McHarg, along with architect/landscape architect William H. Roberts, and architect/urban designer Thomas A. Todd to join him in founding the partnership firm Wallace McHarg Roberts & Todd (WMRT). With Wallace as partner in charge, the plan established the basic principles for development. Over the next 25 years Wallace and his partners were the designers of all of the Inner Harbor's infrastructure, promenades, piers, bridges and fountains, and the design controls for all private development. The Inner Harbor has reportedly received more awards than any other comparable project in the United States. By 1980, with the opening of developer and urban visionary James Rouse's "festival marketplaces" of "Harborplace" by his Rouse Company along the now decade-old waterfront promenade, which was modeled after Boston's restoration/renovation project at the old 18th Century "Faneuil Hall" and "Quincy Market", became the urban success story of the 1980s and 90's in America, hailed in magazines, tourist brochures and travel conventions everywhere. It continued to grow, with the expansion to the east of what became known as "Power Plant Live!" in the hulk of the old former street-car power generating plant on East Pratt Street and nearby Market Place to the north by the "Six Flags Over America" entertainment operator in the later 80's, tweaked in the 90's by local developer David Cordish Company
Lower Manhattan Plan.
Impressed by the Inner Harbor plan, Mayor John Lindsay and the City of New York retained WMRT in 1965 (with Whittelsey, Conklin and Rossant as local architects) to prepare a master plan for the moribund Lower Manhattan district. Excavation for the World Trade Center's foundations was underway, and the plan was to prepare a response to the WTC's impact. Wallace invented an urban design and growth modeling procedure that evaluated existing conditions, determined the susceptibility-to-change, forecast the probability-of-change, and proposed a design response. The catalytic idea in the Lower Manhattan Plan was to develop a predominantly residential community on land created by filling between the bulkhead and pier head lines at both Hudson and East Rivers, adjacent to the single-use commercial centers. Public walkways would be provided at the water's edge, linked by pedestrian ways to the centers and subway stations. The districts' elevated expressways would be depressed. The Lower Manhattan Plan won the Municipal Art Society of New York's Honor Award and was published in ""Progressive Architecture"". The plan also established Wallace and his firm as the preeminent downtown planners and urban designers in the US for the next decade. Plans for the central areas of New Orleans, Louisiana, Buffalo, New York; Miami, Orlando, and Jacksonville, Florida, Oakland and Los Angeles, California, and Baltimore's MetroCenter followed, all employing Wallace's growth modeling method combined with catalytic projects unique to each.
The Lower Manhattan Plan's (LMP) full public access to the rivers and continuous walkways at the water's edge caught the eye of John Weingart, then director of New Jersey's Division of Coastal Zone Management. Part of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, his division had been assigned regulatory control over a -deep coastal waterfront, and he saw the LMP concept as applicable. He retained the newly formed Wallace Roberts & Todd (WRT), after Ian McHarg left the firm, to prepare the plan and develop design guidelines for the , nine-community facility. Mandated for both public and private developers, to date, 75% of the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway is completed or in planning.
Recognition.
David A. Wallace received the "John Harbeson Award" from AIA Philadelphia for distinguished service to the profession in 2002 and the American Planning Association's "Distinguished Leadership Award" in 2003. He was the author of ""Urban Planning/My Way"", a memoir published by The Planners Press in 2004 that features case studies that examine the evolution of large-scale urban development in the 20th Century.
Throughout his career, Wallace initiated and investigated new ideas through teaching, first at the University of Chicago, then at the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught for 17 years. Through the network of his former students, staff, and the many people who have participated in his work as clients and stakeholders, he made a significant contribution to the profession and to the communities where he worked. In all, David Wallace was a true pioneer of planning practice, education, and theory whose work had a direct, significant, and positive impact on the field that endures to this day. This long-term impact can be seen not only in his own extant work, but in the work of others whom he has influenced.
In 2008, both APA Pennsylvania and National APA recognized the importance of Wallace's contributions to the planning profession, as having significantly and positively redirected planning with long-term results, and selected him for the 2009 AICP "National Planning Pioneer Award".

List of Persona 4 characters

The plot of Atlus's PlayStation 2 role-playing game is centered around a group of high-school students dedicated to capturing the culprit responsible for the murders and kidnappings that happened in their small town of Inaba starting in April 11, 2011. The case is linked by the TV world, a dimension where the characters use alteregos known as to defeat the Shadows, beings that represent people's hidden thoughts that killed the first two victims. The protagonist is Yu Narukami, a high-school student who moved into the town from the city. He is met by Yosuke Hanamura, the son of the local department store manager; Chie Satonaka, an energetic girl with a strong interest in kung fu; Yukiko Amagi, a calm and refined girl whose family owns the local inn; Kanji Tatsumi, a first-year student whose punk reputation hides a softer side; Teddie, a mysterious figure from the TV world who exists in the form of a cartoonish bear costume; Rise Kujikawa, a popular teen idol who has taken a break from showbiz; and Naoto Shirogane, a well-known junior detective who disguises her true identity by dressing as a young man.
"Persona 4" has been adapted to a manga and an anime series that gave different portrayals to the game's cast, most notably the protagonist who is given his own name and a personality. The game was also ported for the PlayStation Vita as ' which expanded various of the characters' stories and included a new one called Marie, a teenage girl linked with the Investigation Team. A fighting game sequel, "Persona 4 Arena", features the Investigation Team in a tournament competing against each other as well as characters from the prequel '.
Shigenori Soejima acted as the art director for the game and was responsible for the character design. The general approach to designing the characters and ultimately the setting of the game was by drawing from the memory and interpretation of the development staff about a "rural, countryside" setting. Reception of the game's characters are mostly positive, with various characters having been reviewed favorably. This included the characters' realistic personalities and the relationships established across the game. The English voice acting work was also met with a similar response.
Creation and design.
Shigenori Soejima was in charge of designing the characters in "Persona 4". With the series now taking place in a fictional rural town rather than a city like in the prequels, the characters with origins from the city had hair styles different from those in Inaba with 1UP.com commenting that Yu's and Yosuke's were more stylish. The non-player characters with whom the player forms Social Links, a game mechanic wherein the player fosters friendships with the characters to unlock more powerful Personas, had no models in their creation, but Soejima had vague memories about their actions based on his experience when first hearing the ideas. However, as a result of adding the mystery element in the game, the staff decided to make the characters act like real people. Therefore, none of them acted in a stereotypical fashion with director Katsura Hashino stating that this was since "the worldview was already pretty far from the ordinary."
Each player character's "Shadows Selves" are meant to act out-of-character in their first scene as a result of appearing in the Midnight Channel. While in this state, the Shadows entertained the audience watching the program; when the player encounters the real person with their respective Shadow Self, they behave more coherently. This resulted in the portrayal of one of the more popular character's shadow, Kanji's, to behave in a stereotypically gay manner. At the same time, it also revealed more about his person as a whole. No changes were made to these scenes as they were meant to "depict the contrast between what people appear to be and how they really are."
Playable characters.
The playable characters are part of the in charge of finding of solving the case of murders and kidnappings happening in Inaba. Upon entering a dimension labeled as the "TV world", they search for the victims and use their Personas to defeat possible enemies. Towards the end of the game, the Investigation Team is re-identified as when they seek out the reasons behind the murders and kidnappings.
Yosuke Hanamura.
Yosuke's Shadow becomes the Persona , a red-scarved humanoid whose head vaguely resembles that of a cartoon frog decked with shuriken for eyes and on his hands, as well as bell-bottoms. As the first Shadow, Soejima designed it to make it similar to Jiraiya to convey the fact that Shadows and Personas are the same thing. Yosuke dual wields blades ranging from blunt wrenches to knives to daggers in battle. Throughout the player's interaction with Yosuke, he overcomes Saki's death and confronts his feelings about Inaba accepting it as an enjoyable town despite his initial feelings. After this, Jiraiya evolves into , a humanoid wearing a blue jumpsuit surrounded by a large sawblade with a flame rising from his head. In the re-release "Persona 4: Golden", Yosuke's Persona can evolve once more into , gaining a fireman's outfit, a large afro-like fireball spouting from his head, and sawblades beneath his feet.

He also serves as the main character of the manga "Persona 4 The Magician" that focuses on his life in Inaba before the game's start. He is voiced by Showtaro Morikubo in Japanese and Yuri Lowenthal in English. Lowenthal enjoyed playing Yosuke owing to the large number of events the character goes through despite being initially a comic relief. Takahisa Maeyama portrays him in the musical.
Chie Satonaka.
Following the encounter with her Shadow, Chie receives the Persona , a muscular female figure wearing a yellow outfit and armed with a naginata, that she uses in combat while she performs kicks. Throughout Yu's interactions with Chie (which can also be intimate), she discovers that she genuinely wanted to protect Yukiko without any underlying selfish motivations. After this, Tomoe evolves into , whose yellow jumpsuit turns black and is decked in silver samurai armor. The desire to protect people eventually inspires her to seek a career as a police officer.

Yukiko Amagi.
With help from the Investigation Team, Yukiko accepts her Shadow which becomes the Persona , a pink-colored humanoid with sakura-like wings. She joins the group to find the culprit behind the kidnappings and murders, and befriends Yu, with the option of starting a romantic relationship with him (depending on the player's actions). Yukiko voices her wish to the protagonist to leave Inaba and find a career away from managing her family inn. She eventually changes her mind when she realizes she cannot find the heart to leave the family and employees who supported her. Following such understanding, Konohana-Sakuya evolves into , who turns yellow and has metallic chrysanthemum-like wings.

His Persona is , an imposing, black, robotic humanoid which has a skeleton-like design, like Kanji's shirt, and is armed with a large lightning bolt. Throughout Yu's interactions with Kanji, he reveals to be skilled at tailoring inspired by his family who runs a textile shop but stopped making dolls when accused by fellow students. Kanji eventually learns to take pride in his skills, rather than hide them. Shortly afterwards, Take-Mikazuchi evolves into , who has a fiery motif instead of Take-Mikazuchi's skeleton and lightning. Both of Kanji's Personas are based on his own visual appearance. In "Persona 4: Golden", Kanji's new Persona is , which resembles Rokuten Maoh but has elaborate white armor with red flame details.

He is voiced by Tomokazu Seki in Japanese, Troy Baker in English, and Matt Mercer in episodes 13-26 of the English anime dub. Seki's portrayal was highly praised by the game's staff due to the delivery of his lines. Youichiro Omi was cast as Kanji Tatsumi for the "Persona 4" musical.

Teddie, known as in Japan, is a strange part-clown, part-bear-like creature, who resides inside the TV world. Learning that somebody has been throwing people in the TV world to kill them, thus causing mayhem, Teddie makes a promise with Yu Narukami and Yosuke Hanamura to find the culprit. Teddie helps the Investigation Team by giving them advices about how to defeat Shadow or track the people who were thrown into the world. As he interacts with the characters, Teddie starts questioning his own existence and grows curious of mankind's habits such as dating girls. In the game Teddie also starts making puns referencing his name. The translation of these jokes to the English version was noted to be difficult by the Atlus staff. In a 2013 interview, Atlus's senior project manager Masaru Nanba stated that the change of "Kuma" to "Teddie" in the western localizations was a result of the familiarity of the concept of the teddy bear to American and European players, and specifically noted the change of Kuma's verbal tic of adding his name to the end of sentences to the "very" to "beary" change in the English translation.
When fighting Rise Kujikawa's Shadow, Teddie seemingly sacrifices himself to save his friends, defeating the Shadow but becoming flattened in the process. After Rise accepts her other self, saying that there is "no real me", Teddie has an existencial crisis; this causes his Shadow Self to manifest, representing Teddie's fear that his existence is superficial and "hollow". Aided by his friends, Teddie accepts his doubts regarding his existence and his Shadow turns into the Persona , a robotic figure that resembles a rotund red boiler with stubby arms and legs and armed with a tomahawk missile as a pun to the original mythological figure. Afterward, through restoring his body through extensive training, Teddie "grows" a human-like body inside of it and leaves the TV world. Using his bear suit, Teddie starts working in Junes and living with Yosuke. He also becomes an active member in battle, with Rise taking his place for support.
When Yu's cousin, Nanako Dojima, dies after being sent to the TV world, Teddie disappears from the real world. As the group searches for him, Teddie remembers that he was actually a Shadow, one who wanted humans to like him and, as a result, erased his memory and took the form of a cartoonish bear. After Nanako revives, Yu finds Teddie in the Velvet Room, where Teddie reveals his origin as a Shadow and Yu informs him of Nanako's revival. After returning to reality and seeing Nanako, Teddie decides he will stay with the Investigation Team once again despite being a Shadow with Kintoki evolving into , a cartoonish face on a ball with clawed hands at the end of a missile. Following Izanami's defeat and the TV world returning to its original state, Teddie decides he will return to the TV world.

Teddie is playable alongside Kintoki-Douji. He is voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi in Japanese. In the English version of the game Dave Wittenberg is his voice actor while Sam Riegel provides his English voice for "Persona 4 Arena", "Golden" and the anime. Yamaguchi portrayed him in the musical. Early designs of Teddie were to feature him as a more serious-looking character.
Rise Kujikawa.
Recovering from her experience in the TV world, Rise joins the Investigation Team to track the culprit behind the murders in the town, taking Teddie's spot in fights, analyzing enemies and advising her comrades. During Yu's interactions with Rise, she is initially happy for leaving behind the title Risette. However, numerous reminders of her time in the spotlight, a new replacement idol and a letter from her biggest fan, make her regret her departure. Depending on the player's actions, Rise may end having an intimate relationship with Yu. Realizing that Risette is also part of her true identity, she voices her plans to return to her idol job by spring. Following this, Himiko evolves into , a white humanoid with a more complex satellite dish than Himiko. In "Persona 4: Golden", Rise's Persona can evolve once more into , gaining a head resembling a telescope instead of a satellite, two more pairs of arms, and green skin.

After she died as well, Namatame tried to contact the police and Tohru Adachi tricked him into throwing people into the TV to "protect" them from the killer; after the victims began to turn up alive after his kidnappings, he believed he was truly helping them. Like Yu and Adachi, he was given the power to enter the TV world by Izanami. During the epilogue of "Persona 4: Golden", Namatame has been freed from his charges due to lack of suspicion and is running for Inaba's city council inspired by the protagonists' work.

To help the Fox out, the protagonist fulfills the wishes people make on the "ema" the shrine receives, and in turn the Fox's SP restoration price decreases. When all of the wishes have been granted, the shrine receives plenty of donations and is restored to its former glory. In the epilogue, the Fox is shown to have had children. The Fox represents the player's Social Link to ; in "Persona 4: The Animation", this is indicated by Yu Narukami's ability to summon the Persona .
Marie.
After Yu and his friends defeat Ameno-sagiri, Marie vanishes from the real world; if the player does not find her after too long, she will be erased from everyone's memories. In an old cabin near Inaba, Margaret (on a promise to Yu) pulls the entire group through an old TV set, which serves as the only portal to the Hollow Forest, Marie's TV World dungeon. Margaret explains the situation to them: Marie has entered the TV World of her own free will, and that she is going to erase her existence to save the human world. Although initially reluctant, Yu's friends vow to rescue Marie, as she is as much of a friend to them as she is to Yu.
When the group finally finds Marie, she reveals that she is , one part of a greater power like Kunino- and Ameno-sagiri; her role was to spy on the real world for Ameno-sagiri, and absorb the TV world's fog from the real world if the two Sagiri were defeated.

After Izanami-no-Okami's defeat, she reveals that she was one of two halves of Izanami, ; Izanami-no-Okami was the half that granted people's wishes, while Izanami-no-Mikoto was the half that actually thought of the good of people. Over time, Izanami-no-Okami's intentions began to diverge from Izanami-no-Mikoto's; as a result, the latter lost all of her power and memories, becoming a "shard".
When Yu confronts Izanami (the gas station attendant), given that the player had saved Marie in time, Izanami will briefly mention Marie, calling her pathetic for holding onto the bamboo comb (combs are seen as a symbol of separation). After Izanami's defeat, Marie apparently vanishes along with her, as she is absent for Yu's departure at the end of the year. However, when Yu returns to Yasoinaba in summer, she reappears in the real world, taking on the stage name , as a weather forecaster. She proclaims her love for Yu on TV while the main group watches on (much to their disbelief and Rise's outrage), and at the end of the credits can be seen in a photograph together with the rest of the main characters.
Other characters.
Labrys.
During the story mode, it is revealed that the who hosted the tournament is actually Labrys' Shadow in disguise. The player leads Labrys to face her other self, which represents her desire to live like a normal human and attend high school. When Labrys rejects her other self's wishes, it becomes a Shadow accompanied by the evil Persona , which resembles a demonic bull. After the player defeats Shadow Labrys in battle, Labrys accepts her other self and it turns into , a Persona that shares design motifs with Labrys. She then joins Mitsuru's group to find the real culprit behind the P-1 Grand Prix. Ayana Taketatsu provides her voice in Japanese and Cindy Robinson voices her in English, respectively.
Reception.
The characters of "Persona 4" have received major positive critical response as a result of the players' intertactions with them and the themes discussed. The protagonist's role has been noted for allowing the player to build his own "self" along the game while questioning their own. Various comparisons were made regarding the social interactions from "Persona 3" as the development of the social links are relatively faster and more important for the game's battles. The tone was noted be sometimes lighter than in the prequel as it avoided touching depressing themes, but at the same time the character's struggles were much more complex. Additionally, the protagonist's relationships with his relatives who he starts living with were commented for adding more variants to the relationships with these ones focusing on family relationships. Moreover, the inclusion of Shadow versions of the playable characters were praised for the themes they discussed, leading to personal crisis regarding which are their real traits. Kanji Tatsumi's storyline received several responses for his portrayal as homosexual which remains ambiguous across the game. This resulted in positive and mixed reactions from writers as controversial as how he was treated across the storyline and how it could appeal to the fans.
Characters designs employed in the game were noted to be "solid" with a clever use of animation for battles. The English voice actors' performance has been noted to be overall good with notes on the quality and delivery of the lines. However, flaws have been found within the execution of certain lines with IGN noting few moments in which some actors did not fit into their respective characters.

Arndt believes the "Triffids" adaptation was originally scheduled for "Worlds Unknown" #7-8, the final issues, which had instead deviated from SF adaptations to adapt the contemporaneous film "The Golden Voyage of Sinbad" (1974). Arndt also notes, "The 'Savage World' story’s art was done in 1954 for "Buster Crabbe Comics" but it was unused. In 1966 Wally Wood wrote a new script (the original had been lost) for the artwork..."
Subsequent issues.
Subsequent issues featured the original stories "War Toy", by Isabella and penciler George Pérez (issue #2); "Gestation" (#3), "Kick the Can" (#4), and "Old Soldier" (#6), all by writer-artist Bruce Jones; "Encounter at War", by Jan Strnad and Richard Corben (#4); "Paradise Found", by writer Jones and artist Gray Morrow, and "Addict", by writer Don Glut and artist Virgilio Redondo (both #5); "Mind Games", by writer-artist John Allison, and "Visitation", by Glut and Ruben Yandoc (both #6). Thomas succeeded Isabella as framing-sequence writer with the last two issues. Additionally, the magazine reprinted a handful more stories from fanzine and alternative comics, such as Kaluta's "The Hunter and the Hunted" (#2), from "Abyss" #1 (Nov. 1970), and Allison's "Half Life" (#5), from the Canadian publication "Orb" #2 (1974).
Adaptations included Alfred Bester's "Adam ... and No Eve", by writer Denny O'Neil and penciler Jim Mooney (#2); Frank Herbert's "Occupation Force", by Conway and penciler Pérez; Larry Niven's "...Not Long Before the End", by writer Doug Moench and artist Vicente Alcazar; and Harlan Ellison's "'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman", by writer Roy Thomas and artist Alex Niño (all #3); A. E. van Vogt's "The Enchanted Village", by writers Don & Maggie Thompson and artist Dick Giordano, Otis Adelbert Kline's "A Vision of Venus", by writer-artist Tim Conrad, and Robert Silverberg's "Good News From The Vatican", by Conway and artist Adrian Gonzales under the pen name Ading Gonzales (all #4); Larry Niven's "All The Myriad Ways", by writer-artist Howard Chaykin (#5); and Michael Moorcock's novel "Behold the Man", by Moench and Niño.
Interviews with Bester, Herbert, Niven, and van Vogt appeared in issues containing their respective adaptations. A planned adaptation of Robert Bloch's "A Toy for Juliette", promised in the letters page of issue #3, did not materialize here, although it was eventually adapted by Rick Geary for an independent comic in the mid-1980s.
Cover artists included Brunner, Frank Kelly Freas, Michael Kaluta, Michael Whelan, and Sebastià Boada, pseudonymously under one of his middle names, Puigdomenech.
Annual publication.
The "Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction Giant Size Special Issue" #1, cover-dated simply 1976, contained the original stories "Journey's End", by writer Bruce Jones and artist Alex Niño; "The Forest for the Trees", by Jones and artist Vicente Alcazar; "Preservation of the Species", by Jones and the mononyn credit "Redondo" (either Virgilio Redondo or his brother and frequent Marvel contributor Nestor Redondo is uncertain); "Clete", by writer-artist Jones; "Sinner", by writer-artist Archie Goodwin, reprinted from "witzend" #1 (July 1966); and "Threads", by Mat Warrick and Gonzales. Glut and Yandoc adapted Stanley G. Weinbaum's "A Martian Odyssey". Don Newton painted the cover. The annual also featured an interview with Theodore Sturgeon, and a reprint, from "Worlds Unknown" #4, of Conway and John Buscema's adaptation of Fredric Brown's "Arena".
Historian Arndt believes "Threads", credited to writer Mat Warrick, "may actually be by Mal Warrick, a fanzine & science fiction writer of the time." A writer named Mat "Warwick" published comic-book SF in this mid-1970s timeframe in "Star Reach". Additionally, "Threads" was reprinted in the Marvel UK title "Star Wars Weekly" #3 (Feb. 1978), credited under yet another variant of the name, Matt Warrick.
Editor Roy Thomas, in an editorial on page 4, dated September 1976, wrote that the series "didn't quite succeed in selling the magic number of copies needed to sustain it. No, it didn't lose money ... it didn't make quite enough profit to allow it to be continued. ... Still, in the meantime we had enough material on hand for two or three issues, counting a couple of finished scripts, as yet unillustrated, plus a couple of stories already totally completed. So, after many conferences ... I received the go-ahead to put out a giant one-shot special."
A column on page 95 of the special explains that the story "Man-Gods", planned for this issue and promoted on Marvel Bullpen Bulletins pages and elsewhere, had become lost by the U.S. Postal Service. The story, with art by Niño, is unrelated to "Man-God", an adaptation of Philip Wylie's Übermensch novel "Gladiator", by Thomas and Tony DeZuniga, that appeared in the Marvel/Curtis magazine "Marvel Preview" #9 (Winter 1976). However, a 37-page story titled "Man-Gods from Beyond the Stars", by co-plotter Thomas, writer Doug Moench and artist Niño, had by this time seen print in "Marvel Preview" #1 (1975). The column stated that the replacement for "Man-Gods" was the four-page Goodwin story and the 15-page "Arena" reprint.

Japanese destroyer Shimakaze (1920)

History.
Construction of the large-sized "Minekaze"-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's 8-4 Fleet Program from fiscal 1917–1920, as an accompaniment to the medium-sized , with which they shared many common design characteristics. Equipped with powerful engines, these vessels were capable of high speeds and were intended as escorts for the projected s, which were ultimately never built. "Shimakaze", built at the Maizuru Naval Arsenal, was the fourth ship of this class. It was laid down on September 5, 1919, launched on March 31, 1920 and commissioned on November 15, 1920.
On completion, "Shimakaze" was assigned to Yokosuka Naval District as part of Destroyer Division 3 under the IJN 2nd Fleet. On October 11, 1928, in Uraga Channel, while on night training maneuvers, "Shimakaze" collided with her sister ship , resulting in significant damage to her port side, and requiring extensive repairs. 
From 1938-1939, "Shimakaze" was assigned to patrols of the northern and central China coastlines in support of Japanese combat operations in the Second Sino-Japanese War. During the Battle of Shanghai on September 25, 1937, while engaged in operations on the Huangpu River, "Shimakaze" came under fire from troops of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army, wounding Destroyer Division 3 commanding officer Lieutenant commander Prince Fushimi Hiroyoshi.
In December 1938, Destroyer Division 3 was disbanded, and "Shimakaze" was reassigned to the reserves.
As Patrol Boat No.1.
In April 1940, after extensive modifications, "Shimakaze" was returned to active duty as a patrol boat, and renamed . These modifications included a reduction in the number of boilers to two, which in turn cut her top speed to 20 knots. The number of Type 3 120 mm guns was likewise reduced from four to two, and all torpedo launchers were removed. In their place, four triple Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Guns were added, as well as 18 depth chargess. The stern of the ship was modified to house two landing crafts, capable of landing 250 naval infantry troops. After the start of the Pacific War, "Patrol Boat No.1" was assigned to patrols and escort missions in the Philippines, Netherlands East Indies and Solomon Islands. On January 12, 1943, while escorting the fleet oiler "Akebono" in the Bismarck Archipelago, she was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine near Kavieng, New Ireland at position . 
"Patrol Boat No.1" was removed from navy list on February 10, 1943.

Collapse (topology)

In topology, a branch of mathematics, collapse is a concept due to J. H. C. Whitehead.
Definition.
Let formula_1 be an abstract simplicial complex.
Suppose that formula_2 such that the following two conditions are satisfied: 
(i) formula_3, in particular formula_4;
(ii) formula_5 is a maximal face of K and no other maximal face of K contains formula_6,
then formula_7 is called a free face. 
A simplicial collapse of K is the removal of all simplices formula_8 such that formula_9, where formula_10 is a free face. If additionally we have dim τ = dim σ-1, then this is called an elementary collapse. 
A simplicial complex that has a sequence of collapses leading to a point is called collapsible. Every collapsible complex is contractible, but the converse is not true.
This definition can be extended to CW-complexes and is the basis for the concept of simple-homotopy equivalence.

Operation Flipper

Operation Flipper was a British commando raid, during the Second World War, that included among its objectives an attack on the headquarters of Erwin Rommel, the commander of the Axis forces in North Africa. It was timed to strike on the night of 17/18 November 1941, just before the start of Operation Crusader, a major British offensive. The mission was a total failure. Rommel had left the targeted house two weeks earlier, and all but two of the commandos who managed to get ashore were killed or captured.
Planning.
In October-November 1941, a plan was formulated at 8th Army headquarters to attack four objectives behind Axis lines:
One of the main goals was to kill Rommel himself. This was intended to disrupt enemy organisation before the start of Crusader. Rommel's headquarters was believed to be at Beda Littoria because of the reports of Captain John Haselden, inserted earlier, disguised as an Arab, with a reconnaissance team. Haselden had reported Rommel's staff car coming and going from the former Prefecture building. In fact, it had only briefly been Rommel's headquarters and was now the headquarters of the chief quartermaster of Panzergruppe Afrika, General Schleusener. Rommel had moved his headquarters nearer to Tobruk some weeks earlier, since he believed commanders needed headquarters close to the battlefront itself to produce decisive results. In any case, Rommel was not even in North Africa at the launch of Operation Flipper. He had gone to Rome to request replacements for supply ships sunk by the enemy.
The overall operation was led by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Laycock. Lt. Col. Geoffrey Keyes—who had been present throughout the planning stage—selected the most hazardous task for himself: the assault on Rommel′s headquarters.
The raid.
On 10 November, two submarines left Alexandria. carried Keyes, Captain Robin Campbell, Lieutenant Roy Cooke, and 25 men, while transported Laycock, Capt. Glennie, Lt. Sutherland, and 25 men. On the night of 14/15 November 1941, Keyes′ detachment landed on the beach of Hamama (in some sources Hamma), some behind enemy lines. There, they made contact with Capt. John Haselden, Lt. Ingles, and Corporal Severn, inserted earlier by the Long Range Desert Group for reconnaissance. The weather deteriorated and Laycock's group had a much more difficult time getting ashore. Only Laycock and seven men made it; the rest were stranded on "Talisman". Thus, with only 36 of the 59 men available, a change of plan was required. Instead of four detachments attacking separate targets, there would only be three. Laycock remained at the rendezvous point with three men to secure the beach. Keyes led his detachment, totalling 17 men, for the attack on Rommel′s supposed headquarters, while Lt. Cooke took six men to destroy the communications facilities near Cyrene. Haselden's detachment successfully completed its mission and were picked up by LRDG.
Shortly before first light, Keyes′ men moved to a wadi, where they sheltered during daylight. After dark on the second night, the detachment moved off, but their Arab guide refused to accompany the party in the deteriorating weather. Keyes then led his men up a climb followed by an approach march of in pitch darkness and torrential rain. Hiding in a cave during daylight, the detachment advanced to within a few hundred yards of the objective by 22:00 on the third night.
At 23:59, Keyes led his party past sentries and other defences up to the house. Unable to find an open window or door, Keyes took advantage of Campbell′s excellent German by having him pound on the front door and demand entrance. The soldier who opened the door was set upon by Keyes and Campbell, but Campbell had to shoot him. The noise alerted the other German occupants to their presence, fighting broke out, and Keyes was shot. He was taken outside and attended to, but quickly died. Capt. Campbell was then shot in the leg by one of his own men when he ventured around a corner, having previously given his private orders to shoot on sight. With no other option, he passed command to Sergeant Jack Terry and remained behind. Terry gathered the raiding team together and retreated.
Terry and 17 men rejoined Laycock at the beach. Cooke′s detachment did not return. It proved impossible to re-embark on the submarines, so they waited for the weather to improve. However, they were discovered and the enemy began gathering and firing on them. Aware that they could not hope to stand off the large force that was surely being organized, Laycock ordered the men to scatter in small groups. However, only Laycock and Terry made it to safety after 37 days in the desert. The rest were either killed or captured.
Aftermath and legacy.
When news of the raid reached him, Rommel was said to be indignant that the British should believe his headquarters were 250 miles behind the front. Rommel was certainly courageous, and was always close to the front, often visiting the front line, sometimes unwisely close.
Keyes received a burial with full military honours in a local Catholic cemetery on Rommel′s orders. For his actions, Keyes was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.
A fictionalized version of the raid was depicted in the 1951 film, "".
A further attempt to kill or capture Rommel was made in July 1944 in Operation Gaff in France.

Red Embree

Charles Willard Embree (August 30, 1917 – September 24, 1996) was a Major League Baseball pitcher. His key pitch was the curveball.
Nicknamed Red, due to his red hair, Emree joined the Cleveland Indians in , and spent three seasons in their minor league system before joining the major league club in September . After going 3-4 with a 3.86 earned run average for the Indians in , he retired from baseball in order to become a farmer.
He returned to baseball in with some bravado, claiming during Spring training that he would win fifteen games for the Indians that season. That didn't happen, however, he did lead the International League with nineteen wins. He had a stellar minor league career with the Indians, going 74-44 with a 3.07 ERA in their farm system, but it never translated to major league success, mostly due to some hard luck. In , Embree held batters to a .227 batting average, yet he had a losing record (8-12). Despite a respectable 3.29 ERA over parts of six seasons with the Indians, his record was 23-32.
Following the season, he was dealt to the New York Yankees for outfielder Allie Clark. He started his one season in New York, in the starting rotation, and was reasonably successful in that role (5-2 with a 3.29 ERA) before moving into the bullpen. At the end of the season, he, Sherm Lollar and Dick Starr, plus $100,000 were sent to the St. Louis Browns for Roy Partee and Fred Sanford.
Embree was once again a starter when he arrived in St. Louis, however, once again lost his starting job when a July 7 loss to the Detroit Tigers in which he lasted just two-thirds of an inning dropped his record to 3-10 with a 5.03 ERA. He made three spot starts after that, going 0-2 with a 12.96 ERA. For the season, he went 3-13 with a 5.37 ERA and a save.
His contract was repurchased by the Indians prior to the start of the season. He went 31-28 with a 3.96 ERA in two plus seasons with the Pacific Coast League's San Diego Padres before moving to the Chicago White Sox organization during the season.
Career stats.
Over seven minor league seasons, Embree was 100-73 with a 3.49 ERA.

Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse

Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse is an American television anthology series produced by Desilu Productions. The show ran on CBS television between 1958 and 1960. Two of its 48 episodes served as pilots for the 1950s television series "The Twilight Zone" and "The Untouchables".
History.
Between 1951 and 1957, Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball starred in and produced (via their Desilu production company) the popular "I Love Lucy" show. In early 1958, Desi Arnaz convinced CBS to purchase "Desilu Playhouse" with the promise that a bi-monthly "Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show" (later rebroadcast as "The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour") would be among the dramas, comedies and musical numbers planned for the show. Westinghouse paid a then-record $12 million to sponsor the show, which resulted in the cancellation of the prestigious anthology series "Studio One", also sponsored by Westinghouse.
The show debuted on Monday nights in the 10:00–11:00 pm time slot on October 6, 1958, hosted by Desi Arnaz, with Betty Furness continuing as the Westinghouse spokesperson (as she had been on "Studio One"). The first show was "Lucy Goes to Mexico," a Lucy-Desi Hour with guest star Maurice Chevalier. The dramatic "Bernadette" (a biography of Saint Bernadette), starring Pier Angeli, premiered in week two. Later shows included comedies, dramas and musicals, and various one-off comedies and dramas starring Lucille Ball in non-"Lucy" character performances. 
In October 1959, the show moved to Friday nights from 9:00–10:00 pm . The show lasted only one more year, due to an inability to attract big guest stars, the growing popularity of westerns and police shows (it was opposite ABC's highly-rated "77 Sunset Strip" that season), and the Arnaz-Ball divorce in 1960. Just prior to their marital breakup, Ball and Arnaz, along with Vivian Vance, William Frawley, and Keith Thibodeaux, filmed the last Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show entitled "Lucy Meets The Moustache" featuring guest stars Ernie Kovacs and Edie Adams. This last installment of the "I Love Lucy" format and characters was broadcast on April 1, 1960. The final telecast of The Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse, "Murder is a Private Affair", aired on June 10, 1960.

In the fall of 1958, "The Time Element," starring William Bendix, aired to positive reviews. Written by Rod Serling, the show's popularity gave Serling the leverage to convince CBS to give the go-ahead to Serling's concept for a science fiction/fantasy anthology series (which was what Serling had in mind when writing the "The Time Element") that he called "The Twilight Zone" which debuted in the fall of 1959.
In February 1959, "Desilu Playhouse" aired a two-part drama called "The Untouchables". Paul Monash adapted the 1947 memoirs of treasury agent Eliot Ness, played by Robert Stack. After CBS passed on the idea to produce a weekly version, "The Untouchables" became a hit series on ABC and ran for four seasons (1959–1963).
Production notes.

Litmus milk

Litmus milk is a milk-based medium used to distinguish between different species of bacteria. The lactose (milk sugar), litmus (pH indicator), and casein (milk protein) contained within the medium can all be metabolized by different types of bacteria.
Since milk is usually the first substrate used to maintain bacteria, this test allows for accurate depiction of bacterial types. The addition of litmus, other than explaining the pH type, acts as an oxidation-reduction indicator. The test itself tells whether the bacterium can ferment lactose, reduce litmus, form clots, form gas, or start peptonization.

Counting process

A counting process is a stochastic process {"N"("t"), "t" ≥ 0} with values that are positive, integer, and increasing:
If "s" < "t", then "N"("t") − "N"("s") is the number of events occurred during the interval ["s", "t" ]. Examples of counting processes include Poisson processes and Renewal processes.
Because of the third property, a counting process is increasing and hence a submartingale. Then by Doob-Meyer, it can be written as 
formula_1
with a martingale "M"("t") and a predictable increasing process "A"("t"). The martingale "M"("t") is called the martingale associated with the counting process "N"("t") and the predictable process "A"("t") is called the cumulative intensity of the counting process "N"("t").
Counting processes deal with the number of various outcomes in a system over time. An example of a counting process is the number of occurrences of "heads" over some number of coin tosses. 
If a process has the Markov property, it is said to be a Markov counting process.

Meghalaya Democratic Alliance

The Meghalaya Democratic Alliance (MDA) was a coalition of political parties that formed the Government in the state of Meghalaya, India after the Legislative Assembly elections in Meghalaya, 2003. It was headed by the Indian National Congress (INC), which was the party with the highest number of seats in the 7th Meghalaya Legislative Assembly. Chief Minister D. D. Lapang and the other ministers in the Government were all members of the MDA. D. D. Lapang also served as the Chairperson of the MDA.
History.
After the 2003 elections to Legislative Assembly, INC Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) D. D. Lapang was elected the leader of the Congress Legislative Party (CLP).
The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) first made a bid to form the Government, but they gave up when they couldn't provide the Governor M.M. Jacob with sufficient number of MLAs to prove majority in the Assembly.
The INC then formed the MDA along with other parties and independents opposed to the NCP and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
The MDA pledged to work for the state's economic development and also to provide stability of the government.
With 40 members in the 60 member Assembly, Governor M.M. Jacob invited the MDA to form the Government. D. D. Lapang was sworn in as Chief Minister on 4 March 2003.
Initial Support.
At the time of its formation, the MDA included the following members:
In addition the Hill State People's Democratic Party (HPDP) had also expressed willingness to join the MDA, but their MLAs were not provided to the Governor when the MDA stakes claim to form the Government.
D. D. Lapang (INC) served as the Chairperson of the MDA while Dr. Donkupar Roy (UDP) served as the Deputy Chairperson. Martle Mukhim (MDP) served as the Treasurer and R. G. Lyngdoh (INC) served as the Spokesperson.
Changes in constituents.
Though the HPDP legislators were not in the initial list of legislators submitted to the Governor, one of their MLAs Dr. F. A. Khonglam was sworn in as a minister on 4 Mar 2003. Effectively, this meant the MDA had additional support of 2 MLAs from HPDP, taking their total strength in the 60-member Assembly to 42.
Later in 2003, one additional independent joined the MDA, taking the total number of independents supporting the MDA to 4, and the total strength of the MDA to 43.
On 16 December 2003, 6 legislators from the opposition NCP broke away from their party and formed a new party called the Meghalaya Nationalist Congress Party (MNCP). They then joined the MDA coalition increasing the strength of the coalition to 49. 4 of the 6 MNCP legislatures were given ministerial positions in the MDA Government.
Controversies.
In mid-2004, after the Indian general election, 2004, the NCP joined the INC-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) to form the Government of India. It was believed that this decision, might result in the MDA being disbanded with an INC-NCP combination to form the new Government in Meghalaya. However, on 31 May 2004, D. D. Lapang confirmed that the regional MDA coalition would not be affected by the new alliance at the central Government.
In mid-2006, internal conflicts with the Meghalaya Congress Legislative Party (CLP) led to D. D. Lapang resigning as the CLP leader and as the Chief Minister under orders from the Congress high command. His former protégé, J. D. Rymbai was elected new leader of the CLP and Chief Minister on 15 June 2006. Despite the leadership change, the internal conflicts continued with both Lapang and Rymbai claiming majority support in the CLP. After less than a year in-charge, Rymbai was directed by the Congress high command to relinquish the position to Lapang after a secret confidence vote determined that Rymbai no longer had majority support. After refusing to comply with the high command directive for 5 days, Rymbai finally resigned on 10 March 2007. Lapang was reelected as the CLP leader and was sworn in as Chief Minister on 10 March 2008.
Demise of Alliance.
In the lead up to the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly election, 2008 all the regional parties forming the MDA decided to contest against the INC. The UDP, MDP, KHNAM and HPDP fielded candidates against INC and made corruption and government failure as their main election issues to garner votes against the INC.
This effectively meant the quiet demise of the Meghalaya Democratic Alliance after a 5-year survival.
The MDA was effectively replaced by the Meghalaya United Alliance (MUA) after the 2008 elections as INC tried to form the Government with support from independents.

Aston Martin Atom

The Aston Martin Atom is a prototype car, constructed in 1939. The Atom is one of the first fully functional concept cars. Designed by Claude Hill, the body was aluminium over a tubular steel frame, and a marked change in design from previous cars. It was originally powered by a model 15/98 engine, but subsequently upgraded after the war with a 2-litre engine in 1944. Apparently, after driving the Atom in 1947, David Brown decided to buy the Aston Martin company. 
The car is currently owned by Aston Martin enthusiast and collector Tom Rollason, who has owned it since 1985, and is currently on display at the Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon.

The Gray Cloth

"The Gray Cloth with Ten Percent White: A Ladies' Novel" (in German, "Das graue Tuch und zehn Prozent Weiß: Ein Damenroman") is an avant-garde novel by the fantasist and visionary writer Paul Scheerbart, first published in 1914. The book expresses its author's commitment to the use of glass in modern architecture, which had a significant impact on the concepts of German Expressionism.
Glass architecture.
Scheerbart had advocated a transformative new architecture of glass from his first novel, "Das Paradies", through many subsequent works. In 1913 he attempted to organize a "Society for Glass Architecture," an effort that brought him into contact with the Expressionist Bruno Taut. In the following year Scheerbart published not one but two books on the subject: his non-fictional "Glass Architecture" made the case for its subject in a more rational and pragmatic basis, while "The Gray Cloth" provided a far more imaginative and lavish presentation of the same matter.
Plot summary.
The novel is set in the middle of the twentieth century, and opens in Chicago, where the protagonist Edgar Krug has designed an enormous colored-glass exhibition hall. An art exhibit is held there, accompanied by an organ concert. Krug, fiercely dedicated to his esthetic concepts, is unhappy that the bright colors of women's fashions clash with his architectural scheme. When he meets Clara Weber, the organist, he is struck by her gray dress with white lace trim; he finds it the perfect compliment to the color effect of his hall. Krug impulsively asks Clara to marry him — providing she agrees to wear the same style of clothing. Clara accepts Krug's terms, which are specified in their marriage contract. Once married, the couple leave for the Fiji Islands in Krug's private dirigible (it has a glass-walled cupola, and air conditioning).
Though Clara accepts Krug's strange terms for their marriage, other women do not. Clara maintains a telegraphic correspondence with her American friend, Amanda Schmidt; and Amanda is highly critical of Clara's subservience in the arrangement. Later in the book, other women also protest its terms. Scheerbart provides portrayals of a number of strong female characters through the book, supporting its subtitle, "a Ladies' novel."
Krug goes to Fiji because he has an ongoing project there, a retirement home for airship pilots. He clashes with the project's sponsor over how much colored glass the building will accommodate. From Fiji, Krug and Clara travel to other sites throughout the world, to visit other projects.
Their first stop is "Makartland" at the South Pole, an artists' colony for twenty women artists. There, a seamstress makes outfits for Clara that arrange her gray-and-white wardrobe scheme in imaginative ways. Käte Bandel, one of the artists, joins the Krugs in their further travels; she debates artistic assumptions and values with Krug as they travel to Australia and then to Borneo. Bandel enrages Krug when she convinces Clara to wear a plaid scarf.
Leaving Bandel behind, they fly to Japan; but Japanese women also react negatively to the gray and white. In the Himalayas and in Ceylon, Krug visits another projects; later the couple travel to an experimental station by the Aral Sea. They also visit Babylon and Egypt. Despite his enthusiasm for colored glass, Krug turns down an offer to build large glass obelisks atop the Pyramids of Giza. In the "Kurian Murian Islands" off the eastern coat of Arabia, Krug meets the tycoon Li-Tung, who commissions him to design houses suspended in mid-air (so that they don't scratch the majolica tiles with which the islands are paved). Li-Tung is passionate about color, and has Clara change into more varied silk outfits. Krug allows this.
Their journey is not a parade of triumphs, however; in most places, Krug's ideas are resisted, criticized, and rejected to greater or lesser degrees. At Malta, though, a glass architecture museum in established. The Krugs end the novel at their glass house in Switzerland.
At Babylon, Krug gives up on his determination about Clara's wardrobe, and agrees to strike the binding clause out of their marriage contract. By this time, though, Clara has become a convert to her husband's ideas about glass architecture, and maintains the gray fashion by her own choice.
Impact.
Scheerbart certainly influenced Bruno Taut's Glass Pavilion at the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition — the first, last, and only design of German Expressionist glass architecture that was actually constructed. Taut inscribed the fourteen sides of the structure with fourteen quotations from Scheerbart's works. Scheerbart's writings also influenced Carl Krayl, Wenzel Hablik, and other members of the Glass Chain group.
It is an open question how much influence the German Expressionists' work had on the glass skyscrapers of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and other Modernist architects later in the century. The modernists rejected Scheerbart's strong emphasis on the use of colored glass. In one view, though, the modernist glass skyscrapers of the mid-twentieth century "came closer to realizing Scheerbart's vision than the utopian projects of Taut and other Expressionist architects."
Genre.
"The Gray Cloth", like other Scheerbart works, is a challenge to classification. It can be termed a fantasy, though it also shares some characteristics of science fiction (a temporal setting in the future, and advanced technology).
English edition.
Chronologically, "The Gray Cloth" is the last of Scheerbart's novels; but it is also the first to receive an English translation.

Augustus Louis Chetlain

Augustus Louis Chetlain (December 26, 1824 – March 15, 1914) was an United States Army soldier – the first man in Illinois to volunteer at the outbreak of the American Civil War. He served as a Union Army general .
Early life and career.
Chetlain was born in St. Louis, Missouri. His parents were Swiss, and they came to the United States by the way of Canada. As an infant, he was taken to Galena, Illinois. He studied at local schools in Galena, and later became a clerk. In 1852 he started a career in business, and by 1859, he became wealthy. He sold his business in the U.S. and traveled in Europe. Upon returning, Chetlain participated in the 1860 U.S. presidential campaign.
Civil War service.
When the American Civil War began in 1861, Chetlain chose to follow the Union cause. He was said to have been the first man in Illinois to volunteer for the Civil War. On April 16 he was part of a meeting held in Galena to raise a volunteer company, and with Ulysses S. Grant was prominent in its creation. When Grant declined the post (and at his suggestion) Chetlain was elected as the company's captain. In Springfield in late April the 12th Illinois Infantry was organized, and Chetlain's company was added to it. On May 2 he entered the Union Army as captain of the 12th Illinois, and the next day he was elected the regiment's lieutenant colonel.
Shortly afterward the 12th Illinois was ordered to Cairo, and that September it was part of the force used by Grant in the expedition against and capture of Paducah. Then Chetlain was given command of Smithland, Kentucky, where he constructed fortifications to defend part of the Cumberland River. In January 1862 he rejoined his regiment, and led it during the expedition up the Tennessee River, was at the capture of Fort Henry on February 6, and led his command during the Battle of Fort Donelson from February 12 to 16.
On April 6, 1862, Chetlain led his regiment with distinction during the Battle of Shiloh. In the fight he lost about a quarter of his men, and Chetlain was wounded when both his face and chest were seriously bruised. On April 27 he was promoted to colonel for gallantry during the action at Fort Donelson. That May his command participated in the Siege of Corinth and then the battle there on October 3 and 4, during which Chetlain was again highly praised for his performance.
Chetlain was then given command of Corinth, Mississippi, where he began to organize and train black soldiers for Union Army service. This assignment lasted until May 1863, and on December 18 he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. On the advice of Grant, Chetlain was given the task of raising black troops in Tennessee and Kentucky, with his headquarters located in Memphis. By October 1864 he had trained a force of about 17,000 men that were "well armed, drilled, and disciplined."
On June 18, 1865, Chetlain was brevetted to the rank of major general. Between 1865 and 1866 he commanded at Memphis and then at Talladega, Alabama On January 26, 1866, Chetlain was mustered out of the Union Army. His war-time performance has been described as:
Postbellum.
After the American Civil War, Chetlain was assessor of Internal Revenue for the district of Utah from 1867–69. From 1869–72, he was at U.S. consul in Brussels. In 1872, he established himself in the banking business in Chicago and also as a stock broker. He was president of the Home National Bank, organizer of the Industrial Bank of Chicago, director of the Chicago Stock Exchange, and member of the Board of Education. He was also an active philanthropist. He was prominent in the Military Order of the Loyal Legion and the Grand Army of the Republic for many years. In 1893 he wrote "Recollections of Seventy Years". On March 15, 1914 he died in Chicago. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery, Galena.

Debby Boone is an eponymous 1979 album by Debby Boone and her third solo studio album for Warner Bros./Curb. Unlike Boone's previous two albums, 1977's "You Light Up My Life" (No. 6 Pop, No. 6 Country) and 1978's "Midstream" (No. 147 Pop), this album did not reach any Billboard album chart.
The album featured two singles, "My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own" (No. 11 Country) and "Breakin' in a Brand New Broken Heart" (No. 25 Country), that charted earlier in 1979 prior to the August release of this album. Oddly, Warner Bros. released Boone's single, "See You in September" (No. 41 Country, No. 45 AC), when this album was released, although this song was not featured on this album. (To date, "See You in September" has not been featured on any Boone album.) Boone's next single, "Everybody's Somebody's Fool" (No. 48 Country), was also not culled from this album. (This single was eventually included on Boone's 1986 compilation, "The Best of Debby Boone.")
Boone married Gabriel Ferrer shortly after the release of this album on September 1, 1979. At the ceremony, Ferrer's mother, Rosemary Clooney, performed "Theme from The Universal Picture "The Promise" (I'll Never Say "Goodbye")" which Boone recorded for this album.

<doc id="20814993" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20814993" title="Naraggara">
Naraggara

Naraggara was an ancient city in Africa Proconsularis located 33 kilometer northwest of modern-day El Kef, Tunisia. It is considered to be the modern-day town of Sakiet Sidi Youssef, also located in Tunisia. The name Naraggara, a Libyan inscription, suggests a pre-Roman origin for the city, along with the name being bilingual in Latin and Neo-Punic.
Battle of Zama.
Though not much is known about the ancient city itself, it receives recognition from Roman historian Livy as the site of the Second Punic War’s final battle, called Battle of Zama. The Romans, led by Scipio Africanus the Elder, defeated Hannibal’s Carthaginians and put an end to the 17 year war.
The two armies found their way to Naraggara after Scipio devised a strategy to attack Carthage while Hannibal and his army were located in Italy. This was in an attempt to prevent Hannibal from defeating further Roman armies and instead be recalled to Carthage. After landing in Africa, the Roman army successfully defeated the Carthaginian army at the Battle of the Great Plains in 203 BC, which pressured the Carthaginians into offering peace. After the peace treaty was signed, the Carthaginian senate recalled Hannibal from Italy. However shortly thereafter, the agreement was breached by Carthage for attacking a Roman fleet in the Gulf of Tunis. This led to the war being resumed, with both Hannibal and Scorpio deploying troops in Africa and eventually marching toward the battle site near Naraggara, where the Second Punic War would be won by the Romans. 
Some note a discrepancy of where the battle was actually fought. While Livy recounted Naraggara as the historical battle site, Polybius claims it occurred at Margaron, another ancient city nearby, though the exact location is unknown. This may be supported by the fact the features described by Livy and Polybius, in regards to the site of the Battle of Zama, are nowhere to be found near modern Naraggara. 
After the war’s conclusion and ensuing treaty, Carthage was dealt harsh punishments, one of which was requiring permission from Rome to wage war. This created an issue when settling border disputes with neighboring kingdom, and Roman ally, Numidia. After repaying its debt to Rome fifty years after the Second Punic War, Carthage repelled against Numidian invaders and ultimately suffered a military defeat. This attack angered Rome because they did not give such consent to Carthage, and thus declared war. This began the Third Punic War which lasted just four years and ended with Carthage being completely destroyed and all its people enslaved. 
With Carthage’s defeat, its lands and territories, including the area encompassing Naraggara, were claimed by Rome and formed as Africa Proconsularis. Naraggara arguably remained under Roman rule until the 5th century, when Vandals conquered the area and formed their own kingdom. 
Today.
Today, the modern town of Sakiet Sidi Youssef replaces Naraggara. It is part of the Kef Governorate in Tunisia, and has a population of 6,196 as of 2004.
Bishopric.
Naraggara was an episcopal see and the names of some who were its residential bishops at certain dates are known:

Ban Pong, Ratchaburi

Ban Pong, (), is the centre town of Amphoe Ban Pong in Ratchaburi Province, Thailand, covering the whole homonymous subdistrict (Tambon). It is located roughly 77 kilometers west of Bangkok.
History.
The current town was first officially registered as a sanitary district in 1916, after it was moved down the Mae Klong River from the old town, which is now part of Tha Pha municipality. The new town, when it was first built, was flooded with Chinese immigrants migrating from Southern China where drought had occurred for four consecutive years in the 1920s. During the Second World War, the town experienced an economic boom due to its location being a hub between Bangkok to the east, Kanchanaburi to the north and all the provinces in the south of Thailand. All goods transported by rail from Bangkok, Kanchanaburi, Burma and the Southern provinces had to make a stop in Ban Pong.
In 1935, the sanitary district was upgraded to town status ("thesaban mueang").
During the Second World War, the town was used by Japanese Forces as a base in the region while they were connecting the railway between Burma and Thailand, with train services running between Ban Pong and Mawlamyine in Burma during and a few years after the war.
In the 1960s the town once again experience an Economic Boom when several Sugar refineries opened up in the area as the geography of the town is suitable for sugar cane production with the close proximity to Bangkok. Many large Banking and Government institutions located their regional branches here in Ban Pong.
Economy.
There is a large abandoned canning factory in the town. The half-ruined buildings were partly covered with jungle creepers for many years, but now have been demolished.
Nowadays, the town's economy depends very much on the purchasing power of the workforce in Ban Pong District who engage in various industrial activities. Within the district, there are more than 400 factories within Ban Pong district alone, producing everything from jewelry to car parts. Hence, the town centre remains vibrant and prosperous.
However, due to the lack of vision of the last few mayors of the municipality, the town centre now starts to experience a decline in its importance due to the openings of many Hypermarkets in the outskirt of the town. The mayors have not been able to re-invent the new function of the town centre, hence during the day the town is now quiet with less activities going on than the past.

Mech Platoon

Gameplay.
"Mech Platoon" follows real-time strategy gaming standards, and is in the vein of other games such as "StarCraft" and "Command & Conquer". The player assumes the role of an army commander for one of three in-game nations, and must battle on five planets each with multiple missions. In a battle, the player utilizes resources on a battlefield to build a base and attempt to overrun their opponent with "Mechs", the units featured in the game. There are three different types of resources found in the game: Energy Sand, Material Rock, and Laser Crystal. Resources are used to purchase units, and lower-grade resources such as sand can be used to buy more expensive resources such as rock and crystal.
Due to Game Boy Advance hardware limitations, there is a 30-unit maximum per stage and no fog of war. There are twenty standard mechs that are unlocked throughout the game to use during battles, but each of these are customizable with different variants. Each mech also has its own attributes, ranging from differing hit points to varying levels of attacks.
Development.
The game was first displayed to the public at E3 2001, where critics were impressed by the game's graphics but noted problems with unit path finding. A later build was shown at the European Computer Trade Show in November 2001.
Reception.
Overall, "Mech Platoon" was well received by critics; the game received a 77% and a 75% ratings on review aggregate websites Metacritic and Game Rankings respectively.
GameSpot lauded "Mech Platoon" for its graphics and standard real-time strategy conventions on a portable system, writing, ""Mech Platoon" compromises nothing compared with stalwart veterans like "Starcraft" or "Command & Conquer"." GameSpy praised the game for its level selection and detailed graphics. "GamePro" noted, "["Mech Platoon"] boasts lots of nifty features and a few annoying flaws that keep it from beating up on its bigger PC cousins."
Criticism generally focused on the game's sound and the problems with a portable real-time strategy game. GameSpot noted, "game's audio is composed of mostly ear-wrenching midi music with a smattering of crisp digitized sound effects." GameSpy compared "Mech Platoon" unfavorably against turn-based strategy games on the Game Boy Advance, such as Nintendo's "Advance Wars".

It's a Man's World (TV series)

"It's a Man's World" is an American comedy-drama television series which aired on NBC from September 17, 1962, to January 28, 1963.
Synopsis.
The series centers on four young men who live in a houseboat called "The Elephant", which is moored at an Ohio River town named Cordella in Ohio. Cordella is loosely based on the city of Marietta, Ohio, and some of the establishing shots in the series were shot there.
The main characters are pre-law college student Wes Macauley, portrayed by Glenn Corbett and his younger brother Howie, recently orphaned by an automobile accident, played by Michael Burns, also a cast member on "Wagon Train". Ted Bessell played Tom-Tom DeWitt, a college student who came from a wealthy Chicago family. Randy Boone played free spirit Vern Hodges, a talented guitarist from Boone's native North Carolina.
In the story line, Wes is working his way through college at Stott's Service Station, owned by Houghton Stott, played by Harry Harvey, Sr. Jan Norris appears as Wes's fiancee, college student Irene Hoff. Other characters, Iona and Virgil Dobson, are portrayed by Kate Murtagh and Scott White, friends of Stott and the four houseboat males. Their daughter, Alma Jean (played by Jeanine Cashell), is interested in Vern. Nora Fitzgerald (played by Ann Schuyler) is interested in Tom-Tom. There is also a dog named Shadrack.
<br clear=left>
Among the series guest stars were Hope Summers, Joan Tewkesbury, and Dawn Wells
Production notes.
Peter Tewksbury and James Leighton were the creators of the series, a Revue Studios production. Earl Hamner, Jr. was part of the writing staff.
Reception.
"It's a Man's World" was "ahead of its time": it depicted the restlessness, idealism, and increasing iconoclasm that began to emerge among American youth during the early 1960s. Broadcast at the family hour, "It's a Man's World" did not shy from the themes of premarital sex, feminism, and the gulf between adults and adolescents, which began to be known as the generation gap. The program coincided with the Cuban Missile Crisis, civil rights disputes, and the emergence of protest singer Bob Dylan. It attracted a minor cult following on college campuses, but it failed to attract mass audiences.
"It's a Man's World" faced relatively weak competition at 7:30 Eastern on Mondays from the last season of Clint Walker's western "Cheyenne" on ABC and the two long-running CBS quiz programs, "To Tell the Truth" with Bud Collyer and "I've Got a Secret" with Garry Moore.
NBC cancelled "It's a Man's World" midway through its only season, on the grounds of low Nielsen ratings. They ignored viewers who wrote letters of protests, the kind which resurfaced four years later in 1967, when CBS axed "Gunsmoke" but then reversed itself and gave the long-running western another eight years of production.
Aftermath.
After the show was cancelled as of mid-January 1963, Corbett found work almost immediately on the already-airing show "Route 66". "Route 66" was thematically similar to "It's A Man's World", exploring many of the same issues of American life, particularly the issues of restlessness and idealism. Corbett began his co-starring role as Lincoln Case on "Route 66" in March, 1963.

Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology

Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology is the main resource for determining the identity of bacteria species, utilizing every characterizing aspect.
The manual was published subsequent to the Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, though the latter is still published as a guide for identifying unknown bacteria.
First published in 1923 by David Hendricks Bergey, it is used to classify bacteria based on their structural and functional attributes by arranging them into specific familial orders. However, this process has become more empirical in recent years.
Organization.
The change in volume set to ""Systematic Bacteriology"" came in a new contract in 1980, whereupon the new style included "relationships between organisms" and had "expanded scope" overall. This new style was picked up for a four volume set that first began publishing in 1984. The information in the volumes were separated as follows:
"Volume 1" included information on all types of Gram-negative bacteria that were considered to have "medical and industrial importance." "Volume 2" included information on all types of Gram-positive bacteria. "Volume 3" deals with all of the remaining, slightly different Gram-negative bacteria, along with the archaea. "Volume 4" has information on filamentous actinomycetes and other, similar bacteria.
The current volumes differ drastically from previous volumes in that many higher taxa are not defined in terms of phenotype, but solely on 16S phylogeny, as is the case of the classes within Proteobacteria.
The current grouping is as follows:
Critical reception.
The Annals of Internal Medicine described the volumes as "clearly written, precise, and easy to read" and "particularly designed for those interested in taxonomy."

Along for the Ride

Along for the Ride is a novel by Sarah Dessen. It was released on June 16, 2009. The novel focuses of Auden West who never sleeps at night due to her parents' continuous fighting when she was in high school. Before heading off to college, Auden decides to spend her summer before college with her father and his new wife and baby. Although Auden is at first reluctant, she comes to really like her stepmother and half sister. Auden also ends up spending her nights making up for her lost childhood with Eli, a loner and insomniac with an intriguing past. She learns that second chances are possible and questions if people can truly change.
Plot Summary.
Auden West is smart girl who didn't get the chance to enjoy the activities young children often got to do (such as riding a bike) when she was a child. After being accepted into Defriese University and graduating high school, Auden is not sure on how to spend her summer. After receiving a package from her brother Hollis who is touring Europe, she decides to take up her father's offer to spend her summer before college in the beach town Colby. When she arrives, she hopes she can have some bonding time with her father. However, she is disappointed to find out that that will not be the case since her father spends all his time working on his novel. One night Auden heads down to the Tip, a stretch of beach where all the teens hang out. At the Tip she runs into a guy named Jake, who she ends up having a one-night stand with. Feeling guilty about what she done, Auden leaves for home. Early in the morning, she helps out her step mother by supervising her half-sister Thisbe while Heidi rested. Auden also helps Heidi run an errand pertaining to Heidi's boutique Clementine's. 
There she meets one of Heidi's employees, Maggie. Maggie's friends Leah and Esther walk into the store and reveal to Maggie that her ex-boyfriend Jake (who she is still in love with) hooked up with Auden. Auden briefly explains to Maggie that she has no relationship with Jake whatsoever. The next day Auden's family decides to head down to the Last Chance for dinner. It clear that Auden's father is irritated since he does not want to leave the house so he can finish his book.

Chen Mo and Meiting

Chen Mo and Meiting () is a 2002 Chinese romantic drama film written and directed by Liu Hao. It was Liu's directorial debut and stars Du Huanan and Wang Lingbo as the titular Chen Mo and Meiting. 
The film was produced independently of the Chinese bureaucracy, primarily from funds solicited by Liu Hao himself, as well as some foreign investment from the Germany based Zero Film.
"Chen Mo and Meiting" tells the story of a flower vendor and a massage parlor girl, the children of persecuted intellectuals during the Cultural Revolution, as they enter into a shy and tentative romance.
Production.
After writing the screenplay for "Chen Mo and Meiting", Liu set out to find the money to finance his project. Eventually Liu was forced to search for benefactors from the phone book, eventually raising ¥140,000 from a friend in Shanghai. 
Given the small budget, the film production was limited with Liu and the crew living in a small basement to save on housing costs. Post-production was funded primarily from Liu and his producers selling calendars on the street, eventually paying off debts over the course of two years.
Though filmed in 16 mm, the film was blown up to 35 mm during post-production.
Release.
"Chen Mo and Meiting" was screened as part of the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival's international Forum program. The film managed to win two awards at the competition: a NETPAC Prize and a Special Mention in the Premiere First Movie award. 
The film was also screened at the 2002 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival as part of its "Another View" program for more experimental works.
As an independent and foreign-financed film, however, "Chen Mo and Meiting" was not given official approval and as a result was not released in China.

<doc id="20815172" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20815172" title="ʻAtenisi Institute">
ʻAtenisi Institute

ʻAtenisi Institute is located in the Kingdom of Tonga and comprises ʻAtenisi University and the ʻAtenisi Foundation for the Performing Arts. ʻAtenisi in Tongan means Athens, the capital of Greece. The institute, founded by Futa Helu (1934–2010), began as a continuing education programme for civil servants, then initiated a high school in 1964 (now closed) and ʻAtenisi University in 1975.
ʻAtenisi Institute was initially a downtown night school providing continuing education for civil servants, evolving into a secondary daytime school in 1964. In 1966 Helu registered ʻAtenisi's high school with the government and at the end of that year leased a parcel in Halaano, a western district in the Tongan capital of Nuku'alofa. The parcel is, in fact, below sea level and students often speak of the "swampus" instead of the "campus". At the end of 1975 a small university joined the high school on the site, its first bachelor of arts degrees being awarded in 1980, followed a few years later by bachelor of science degrees. By the 1990s, some master of arts degrees – and even a doctorate degree – were awarded in collaboration with universities in Australia and New Zealand.
ʻAtenisi High School.
In the 1960s there were not many high schools in Tonga, and the few that there were catered to either an economic or academic elite. To fill the gap, ʻAtenisi's high school assumed a populist stance, offering inexpensive and innovative education. Yet academic standards were high; for example, whereas other schools settled for the modest New Zealand syllabus, ʻAtenisi choose the more challenging syllabus of New South Wales, Australia.
The 1970s and 1980s were the high school's heyday, at one point attracting some 800 students; however, enrollment began to fall in the 1990s in the face of competition from more than a dozen high schools established by the government or religious organizations. By 2005 school fees were no longer sufficient to cover costs. The school was forced to close in 2006, but reopened in 2007 before closing permanently at the end of 2009.
ʻAtenisi Foundation for the Performing Arts.
ʻAtenisi Foundation for the Performing Arts (AFPA) is a component of the institute whose mission is to preserve the music and dance of traditional Tongan culture as well as to train musicians in classical European music. Some elements of Tongan society regard the foundation as a national treasure. Its director, ʻAtolomake Helu, daughter of Futa, is acclaimed throughout the South Pacific for her classically trained operatic soprano voice. A small orchestra was established in 2000. For a time AFPA regularly toured overseas, performing European classical and operatic excerpts side by side with traditional Tongan music and dance. This cross-cultural approach was typical of the ʻAtenisi ethos and is consistent with the Heraclitian sentiment of "one world, many things, an everlasting fire, common to all".
ʻAtenisi University.
The university at 'Atenisi Institute was established a few years after the University of the South Pacific opened its Tongan campus. Nevertheless, the school was unique in being the only privately founded university in the Pacific, and therefore autonomous from any church or government. This was both an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage was that the university could freely train critical thought, rather than compel students to conform to bureaucratic obedience or religious dogma. The disadvantage was that the university rarely received funding from either of the aforementioned sources, which usually condemned it to an austere budget solely supported by modest tuition fees.
Because the university regarded method of thought to be its pedagogical priority, philosophy was considered its most important course; facility with the English language and appreciation of English literature was a second key objective. In addition, the university offered core courses in the natural sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities. Because of its reputation for rigour, most ʻAtenisi University students found it relatively easy to obtain scholarships to graduate schools in New Zealand, Australia, and the United States.
Decline and Rebuilding.
In the early years of the university, its emphasis on methodology was popular with Tonga's independent farmers: their sons might return to their modest plantations and display classical learning at weekend "faikava" (traditional kava circles). Yet with growing pressure for vocational success among Tonga's urban middle class, only the most talented students remain attracted to ʻAtenisi's classical credo. This has led to a decline in enrollment which, in the face of increasingly more viable tertiary training in Tonga and overseas, threatens the prospects of the small university that Futa Helu built.
Presumably suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Futa Helu retired as institute director and dean of its university in 2007. Since then there has been a rapid turnover in administration. At first his daughter Sisiʻuno assumed the post of institute director in 2008, followed by his son Niulala in 2009, then Sisiʻuno returned in 2010. The university has suffered similar instability in leadership, with Dr. Michael Horowitz taking over as dean from 2008–2010, followed by Dr. Marilyn Dudley-Flores in 2011–2012. The current university Dean is Dr. ʻOpeti Taliai, a Tongan anthropologist who holds a Ph.D. from Massey University as well as an ʻAtenisi undergraduate degree, and previously taught linguistics at the institute.
There has been incremental renovation of the campus since Dr Helu's death in February 2010. A dilapidated science laboratory was removed and replaced with a compact module erected by Group Construction that has, however, not yet been equipped for laboratory instruction. In September 2013 the original university library was abandoned and its collection moved to a more recent and innovative stone building, initially intended as headquarters for the Performing Arts division.
As the sole exponent of critical education in Tonga, 'Atenisi Institute has always suffered from an ambivalent relationship with the Tongan government. On 17 May 2010 the Tonga Public Service Commission (PSC) received a letter from the Director of Education, informing them that the Government does not recognize qualifications from Atenisi University, that degrees obtained from Atenisi University are not valid. A subsequent ʻAtenisi lawsuit against the PSC and the Ministry of Education, alleging employment discrimination in refusing to consider one of the school's graduates, led to an out-of-court settlement through which the University obtained registration from the Tongan National Qualifications and Accreditaion Board (TNQAB) in 2011. In late 2012, the New Zealand In-Country Awards Scholarships program, administered in Tonga through the New Zealand High Commission, terminated its long-standing policy of accepting applications from ʻAtenisi students. Nevertheless, the University conducted a graduation ceremony in November 2012 and plans to conduct one in November 2013.
In mid-2011, Robert Beck, a United States Peace Corps volunteer assigned to teach economics at ʻAtenisi, ended his tour in Tonga six months early, recommending in his report that the Peace Corps terminate its decades-long support. Noting that the mission of the Peace Corps is to support sustainable indigenous institutions, Beck wrote, "The first semester of 2011 has shown that ʻAtenisi University in its current incarnation is not sustainable. Low enrollment, alienated alumni, and debt together mean that reinvention and outside investment will be necessary if Futa Helu's brave creation is to have a future, and it became clear that there was nothing further I could contribute". The Peace Corps' Tonga Post no longer assigns volunteers to tertiary academies, preferring to focus on English language instruction in Tonga's primary and secondary schools.
'Atenisi Institute also became burdened by the bureaucratic interventions of a globalised educational hegemony. The advent of Tongan government regulation of tertiary education in an effort to enforce standards and to boost 'quality' has challenged the recalcitrant institute and threatened its historical independence from the State. In 2011 the TNQAB required ʻAtenisi Institute to cease calling itself a university until it achieves accreditation as such, despite a fifty-year record of producing exceptional Tongan intellectuals and effective postgraduates. Although it was reported in the media that the TNQAB accredited ʻAtenisi in August 2011, in fact the TNQAB merely accepted the institute's registration as a tertiary educational provider. Yet in advertisements in a weekly newspaper in 2013, the institute boasted four resident PhDs on its university faculty - the highest number of accredited Phd lecturers of any equivalent institution in Tonga ... and in August 2013 the TNQAB extended the university's registration for two years.
A controversy emerged after Dr. Marilyn Dudley-Flores and another ex-US military instructor were hired to teach sociology and international relations at 'Atenisi by the then Dean Dr. Michael Horowitz in 2010. Sisiʻuno Helu dismissed these instructors in 2012 because of growing suspicions about the manipulative behaviour and intentions of these faculty members and allegations of their malpractice in the context of 'Atenisi administration. In late 2012 some of the faculty left the institute in protest over these dismissals but Helu stood by her decision. In January 2013 the disgruntled former faculty members, many of whom were once Futa Helu's students, launched the now-defunct Tonga International Academy and some pursued a systematic campaign of misinformation against their former school and employer.
Despite an arduous 50 year history and countless attempted subversions, 'Atenisi Institute has survived into 2013 under the academic leadership of Dr. 'Opeti Taliai - a talented Tongan linguist and teacher of Pacific Studies. Under Dr. Taliai, his wife, the well-reputed lawyer Mele Tuilotulava (as Financial Controller) and Futa Helu's daughter Sisi'uno (as Director), 'Atenisi Institute has surmounted financial debt for the first time in a decade. The very well-regarded New Zealand sociologist and poet Dr. Scott Hamilton joined the institute in February 2013 and, in July, former university dean Dr. Michael Horowitz returned to it. This leadership team is now engaged in the rebuilding of the school in line with Futa Helu's values of rigour and independent criticism.
Documentary film.
In August 2012, a film on Futa Helu's life and the history of ʻAtenisi was screened at the New Zealand International Film Festival, garnering a favourable review in the New Zealand Herald. The documentary, Tongan Ark, was created, directed, and photographed by Paul Janman, a Welsh-Kiwi anthropologist and former ʻAtenisi instructor. Tongan Ark has now been accepted into American and European film festivals and in July 2013, it is screening on New Zealand's Rialto Channel as part of a showcase of New Zealand cinema. Since Tongan Ark deals with the inspiring tragedy of Futa Helu's last years, Janman is now engaged in a second film which he hopes will chart the growth of the institute and the fulfilment of the late Futa Helu's legacy.

Greatest Hits (Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band album)

Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band Greatest Hits is Bruce Springsteen's fifth compilation album, released as a limited edition first in the United States, Canada and Australia on January 13, 2009 exclusively through Wal-Mart retailers.
History.
The album is a collection of some of Springsteen's hit singles and popular album tracks through the years. Springsteen released a similar "Greatest Hits" album in 1995. Unlike the previous release, this album is billed to "Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band," the first time Springsteen's backing band has been credited with a compilation release. As such, it contains no Springsteen material recorded between 1984 and 2002, during which period he did virtually no studio recording with the E Street Band. 
Springsteen's association with Wal-Mart drew puzzled reactions from the media, given the singer's longtime support for labor causes and the company's longtime anti-union actions. "Huffington Post" writer Tony Sachs pronounced the release one of the "top five boneheaded music industry moves of 2008," while "The Wall Street Journal" wrote that it reflected the duality of "the liberal singer-songwriter and the commercial juggernaut recording artist." Longtime Springsteen writer Charles R. Cross said that fans were now more accepting of such blatant commercial strategies given the overall slump in the music business. Nevertheless, the release did draw criticism from some fans as well as from labor union activists and independent record store owners. In response, Springsteen manager Jon Landau said, "et's start with the premise that Bruce is already in Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart has been 15% of our sales in recent years. It's not a question of going into Wal-Mart; we're there. They, and other retailers, are all looking for some way to differentiate themselves, and we try to accommodate each one. We're not doing any advertising for Wal-Mart. We haven't endorsed Wal-Mart or anybody else." But then Springsteen himself, during publicity for his appearance at Super Bowl XLIII, admitted that they "dropped the ball" with the association with Wal-Mart, and attributed it to insufficient vetting due to too many activities going on.

Bill Supplee

William C. "Zuke" Supplee (c. 1903 – July 1966) was an American educator and college athlete. He attended the University of Maryland where he played college football and basketball for the Maryland Terrapins, and competed in track & field. In 1923, he received second-team All-America football honors, which made him the first Maryland player honored as such.
Early life and college.
Supplee was born in Washington, D.C. In 1922, he enrolled at the University of Maryland. During his initial year, he competed on the freshman track and football teams. Supplee earned varsity football letters each of the next three seasons. In 1923, Supplee was named a second-team All-American by the Associated Press, which made him the first Maryland football player to receive All-America honors. His performances during the team's win against Penn and its narrow loss to period powerhouse, Yale, have been cited as the main reasons for his selection. He also received an All-America honorable mention from Walter Camp. In 1924, he was selected to the All-South Atlantic and the All-Maryland football teams, the latter of which was composed of the state's best players. Walter Camp again named Supplee an honorable mention All-American. In his final season in 1925, he served as the football team's captain.
Despite all of his athletic endeavors, Supplee excelled in his academic studies. One of his professors said of him, "To those who slander the American athlete as being a poor student and inferior intellect, I should like to point out Supplee as Maryland's refutation." Supplee graduated in 1926 with a bachelor of science degree in education.
Later life.
He later earned a doctorate and served on the university's faculty as a chemistry professor in the 1940s and 1950s. He also served on the university's athletic board.
Supplee and his wife, Grace, had two daughters. He drowned in 1966 at Rocky Gorge Reservoir in Laurel, Maryland at the age of 63. His wife, Grace died in 2000. In 1982, Supplee was posthumously inducted into the University of Maryland Athletic Hall of Fame.

Portland Hempstalk Festival

Portland's Hempstalk Festival is an annual event in Portland, Oregon advocating decriminalization of marijuana for medicinal, industrial, and recreational use. Founded in 2005, the festival often takes place the weekend after Labor Day and features food vendors, live music, and information booths. The event has always been free to attend.
According to Paul Stanford, founder and director of the event:
History.
The Portland Hempstalk Festival is an annual, two-day event. Hempstalk was first held in Portland, Oregon's Tom McCall Waterfront Park in downtown Portland in 2005 and 2006, with about 10,000 visitors each of the first two years.
In 2007, nearly 20,000 people attended the third annual Hempstalk festival at Sellwood Riverfront Park. While organizers insisted smoking would not be tolerated, the smell of marijuana lingered in the air and some festival goers chose to consume various forms of cannabis foods. No festival attendees were arrested. Originally slated for Tom McCall Waterfront Park, the event was temporarily canceled by Portland Parks & Recreation due to "unspecified 'problems' the city encountered with the event in the past two years there." According to the Hempstalk official site, after being denied a permit at Waterfront Park based upon the city's ruling, the previous location was already booked and the City Parks & Recreation Department "refused to issue a permit to use a different park, citing unsubstantiated claims that minors were drinking beer in the park... and widespread marijuana smoking was taking place (not in public view and only by medical marijuana patients)." Hempstalk officials deny these claims. Due to limited space, officials had doubts about hosting the event at Sellwood Riverfront Park in the future.
In 2008, the festival was held in Eastbank Festival Plaza, organized by Paul Stanford of The Hemp and Cannabis Foundation (THCF). In addition to the usual events and activities featured, the two-day event offered educational panels to inform attendants about industrial hemp, the legal use of marijuana, and answer any other questions they may have.
On September 12-13, 2009, the Portland Hempstalk Festival moved to Kelley Point Park, in the far Northwest corner of Portland, Oregon, at the confluence of the Columbia River and the Willamette River. 40,000 people attended over two days. Music was performed by Native American political activist, poet and songwriter John Trudell and his band, Bad Dog, Folk Uke (Amy Nelson and Cathy Guthrie, daughters of Willie Nelson and Arlo Guthrie), the Herbivores, Rocker T, the Human Revolution, Binghi & the Seventh Seal, State of Jefferson, Marquee, Pass Margo and Tim Pate. Speakers included famed author and activist, Jack Herer, making his fifth Hempstalk appearance. Herer had a heart attack and collapsed moments after giving a speech on Saturday, September 12. He was in critical condition in a Portland area hospital for a month and moved to a Eugene, Oregon nursing home in early October 2009 for further recovery.
Other Hempstalk speakers have included National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) founder Keith Stroup, NORML director Allen St. Pierre, THCF and CRRH director and author of the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act Paul Stanford, Oregon NORML director Madeline Martinez, Chris Conrad, Mikki Norris, comedian and writer Ngaio Bealum, Green Party 2012 presidential candidate, Jill Stein, author Bill Drake, Dr. Tod Mikuriya, Dr. Phillip Leveque, Seattle Hempfest director Vivian McPeak, and medical marijuana pioneer, Dennis Peron.

Chiropractic neurology

Chiropractic Neurology is a subspecialty of chiropractic practice. There are currently 10 specialties recognized by the American Chiropractic Association (ACA). These approved specialties include Diagnostic Imaging, Rehabilitation, Acupuncture, Clinical Nutrition, Diagnosis and Management of Internal Disorders, Orthopedics, Clinical Neurology, Forensic Sciences, Pediatrics and Chiropractic Sports Physician. 
Board certification.
Currently there are 2 certifying chiropractic neurology boards in the United States, American Chiropractic Neurology Board (ACNB) and the International Board of Chiropractic Neurology (IBCN), although historically there have been a total of five certifying neurology boards: ACBN, ACAN, ACNB, IBCN, and CBCN. The first chiropractic neurology board, the American Chiropractic Board of Neurology (ACBN), was a private company that issued its own diplomate certification (DACBN). A second board was formed and established its examination and certification process with the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE). This second board was under the counsel of the American Chiropractic Association (ACA) and was called the American Chiropractic Academy of Neurology (ACAN). The ACAN certified a diplomate called the Diplomate of the American Chiropractic Academy of Neurology (DACAN). Later the ACA disbanded the ACAN in favor of a newly formed board the American Chiropractic Neurology Board (ACNB) that was essentially a merger of the ACNB and the ACAN allowing prior diplomates to be recognized under the new board. Some prior members of the ACAN later formed a fourth board called the International Board of Chiropractic Neurology (IBCN). The fifth diplomate was briefly offered by Logan College of Chiropractic called the DCBCN.
American Chiropractic Neurology Board.
The ACNB is the result of a merger of two older chiropractic neurology boards, the 
American Chiropractic Academy Neurology (ACAN) and the American Chiropractic Association Council on Neurology (ABCN). This merger was mediated by the ACA & therefore the only neurology diplomate certifications recognized by the ACA are: DACAN, DABCN, & DACNB. The ACNB is then recognized by the ACA and also fully accredited by the National Commission for Certification Agencies (NCCA) who is accredited by the National Organization for Competency Assurance (NOCA). Applicants for this board have completed their educational training and completed a minimum of 300 credit hours through institutions approved by the continuing education committee of the Commission for the Accreditation of Graduate Education in Neurology. 
The ACNB diplomate certification examination involves a written portion and an oral practical. The written exam covers material pertaining to the breadth and depth of 12 topics or domains, these topics include disorders relating to the following: the brain and its environment, lobes of the brain, the brain stem and cranial nerves, the spinal cord, the peripheral nervous system, the autonomic nervous system, the cerebellum and vestibular system, the basal ganglia and limbic system, muscular/neuromuscular junction/receptors, sensory systems, neuroendocrine systems, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. The oral practical examination evaluates for proficiency in obtaining a complete case history, physical examination, performing special tests, and identifying physical findings of case examples. The ACNB also offers specialty certifications in electrodiagnosis, vestibular rehabilitation, and childhood developmental disorders.
International Board of Chiropractic Neurology.
The IBCN is affiliated with the International Academy of Chiropractic Neurology (IACN) that was formed on July 1, 1998. The responsibility of the IBCN is to administer a comprehensive, psychometrically valid, unbiased examination. Neurology diplomates of the IBCN are recognized in most states and countries in the world, and IBCN diplomates are officially recognized by The Florida Board of Chiropractic Medicine. 
Applicants to IBCN must complete a minimum of 300 classroom hours of post-graduate neurology training obtained by an institution accredited by the Council of Chiropractic Education (CCE). The examination structure includes a two part approach: Part 1 is a 200 question written examination and Part 2 is an OSCE format practical.

Vermont Route 142

Vermont Route 142 is a north–south state highway in Vermont, United States. It runs from the state border with Massachusetts northward through the town of Vernon to the town of Brattleboro, ending at an intersection with U.S. Route 5.
Route description.
Vermont Route 142 begins at the state border in Vernon, where it continues southbound as Massachusetts Route 142 in the town of Northfield. Route 142 heads north into the town of Vernon, serving the town center before winding north towards Brattleboro. En route to the city, Route 142 parallels Interstate 91 and US-5, which run to the west, and New Hampshire Route 119, which runs just east of the Connecticut River. Route 142 spends its entire length hugging the river, never straying far from its west bank. It runs directly next to the river upon crossing into Brattleboro, proceeding into the heart of the town, where it ends at an intersection with US-5 and Route 119, which begins at the same intersection. Route 119, the second shortest Vermont route at just in length (but fully signed nonetheless), crosses the bridge to the east, becoming NH-119 and proceeding south along the east bank of the river, opposite Route 142. US-5 southbound provides access to I-91 at Exit 1, and US-5 northbound provides access to Vermont Route 9 and Vermont Route 30, which intersect less than to the north.

Ralph Mackin

Ralph Mackin and his wife were a Seventh-day Adventist couple from Ohio, United States. They claimed to experience gifts of the Holy Spirit such as prophecy, speaking in tongues, and even casting out demons. They caused a stir at a local Adventist camp meeting, which was reported in the local newspaper. They later sought the counsel of Ellen G. White, whom Adventists believe had the gift of prophecy. White was initially cautious regarding their experiences, and later came out opposed to them. After leading some meetings at an Adventist church for a time, they pass from prominence in the church.
Biography.
On November 12, 1908 Ralph Mackin and his wife from Ohio visited Ellen White at her "Elmshaven" home in California, having called on Willie White the previous day. Aged in their thirties, they sought her counsel and approval of some spectacular experiences, but she counseled not to continue. Ralph stated, "If we are in a delusion, we want to know it, just as much as if we were in the right." His wife added, "Our brethren certainly think that we are in a delusion."
Nearly three years earlier their Findlay, Ohio church sought "the outpouring of the Holy Spirit." They studied the Bible and Ellen White's writings, seeking a "blessing of sanctification" which they received in the form of speaking in tongues as in . 
The Mackins had visited a family in Clyde who also received the "blessing", marked by weeping in many of them. A "little girl ten or eleven years old" told them "through the Spirit of prophecy", "You go to Toledo". They were also told imprisonment would ensue there. In Toledo a Polish Catholic heard Mrs. Mackin in his own tongue. When the Mackins returned to Clyde they were arrested for mesmerism. This occurred six or eight weeks before seeing the Whites.
They caused a stir at the Adventist camp meeting in Mansfield, Ohio, which resulted in the arrests of the Mackins, plus their daughter, Ralph's mother, and "Sister Edwards". They believed the Spirit had told Mrs. Mackin to go to the campground and sing, "only as she prays in the Spirit and special power comes upon her." However they were arrested for disturbance. In court, one witness testified, "I never heard such singing in my life. It just thrilled me through and through." Supporters had stated, "It is when the singing is extemporaneous – dictated by the Spirit – that it is the most wonderful." (They also claimed the gift of tongues, with Ralph speaking Chinese and his wife Yiddish as the result of a vision;)
They read numerous passages from the Bible, and some experiences of Ellen White. They also spoke of casting out demons:
(White later rebuked them:
Ellen White expressed her caution, sharing how past experiences had made her "fearful of anything savoring of a spirit of fanaticism." It had tarnished the church's image, taking "years to outlive the influence that these exhibitions of fanaticism had upon the general public." She said they should focus on sharing the Bible: "We must direct the minds of the people to the Word as the foundation of our faith...It is through the Word—-not feeling, not excitement— that we want to influence the people to obey the truth. On the platform of God's Word we can stand with safety."
The meeting concluded, and the following day the Mackins went to San Jose. Ralph was invited to preach at the church there, and meetings continued for several days until the pastor returned and stopped them, following which Ralph continued to hold meetings in supporters' homes.
Two weeks later Ellen wrote to S. N. Haskell, "before the end" some " will treat as something of great importance these peculiar manifestations, which are not of God, but which are calculated to divert the minds of many away from the teachings of the Word." Later, "God's work is ever characterized by calmness and dignity."
In December Ellen White received one or two visions about the case, and wrote two letters on the 11th, one to the Mackins and one to "Our Brethren in California". To the Mackins she wrote in part, "You suppose that all you do is for the glory of God, but you are deceiving yourselves and deceiving others... You attempt to make the truth of God sustain false sentiments and incorrect actions that are inconsistent and fanatical." She also wrote, "I was bidden to speak decidedly against this fanatical work." She was concerned that fanaticism would give the church a bad image:

Dionte Christmas

Dionte Lamont Christmas (born September 15, 1986) is an American professional basketball player who currently plays for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association.
High school career.
Christmas attended Samuel Fels High School in Philadelphia. In his junior year (2002–03), he averaged 17.7 points per game and was named honorable mention All-Public. He followed this by leading the City of Philadelphia in scoring, averaging 26.5 points per game and gained first team All-Public honors, as well as being named third team all-City.
After completing his education at Samuel Fels, Christmas prepped for a year at Philadelphia's Lutheran Christian Academy. He averaged 18 points per game on a team that went 35-3 and ultimately placed nine players on Division I basketball rosters.
Collegiate career.
Christmas was a reserve as a freshman (2005–06) on a Temple team that went 17-15 and featured future NBA player Mardy Collins. The team went to the NIT, giving Christmas his first taste of post-season play.
Christmas broke out his sophomore year (2006–07), leading Temple and the Atlantic 10 in scoring at 20 points per game. He was named second team All-Conference and the league's Most Improved Player. He also garnered his first Philadelphia Big 5 recognition as he was named first team All Big 5. However, the year was disappointing from a team standpoint as Temple went 12-18 and missed the post-season.
Christmas picked up where he left off in his junior season (2007–08), again leading the Atlantic 10 in scoring at 19.7 ppg. In doing so, he became only the third player in the history of the conference to lead the league in scoring in consecutive seasons. At the end of the year, Christmas was named first team all-conference and Big 5. In the 2008 Atlantic 10 Tournament, Temple defeated LaSalle, Charlotte and St. Joseph's to win the conference title and an automatic berth to the 2008 NCAA Tournament. Christmas was named Most Outstanding Player of the event after scoring 57 points in the three games, including 22 in the final game.
Christmas entered his senior year with pre-season All-American buzz. He was tabbed an Atlantic 10 preseason All-Conference pick and was on the candidate list for both the Wooden Award and the Lowe's Senior Class Award. On December 13, 2008, he scored a season-high 35 points in a nationally televised upset of #8 Tennessee. He was tabbed ESPN.com National Player of the Week for his efforts.
Christmas finished his Temple career with 2,043 points, becoming only the fourth player in school history to eclipse the 2000-point mark. During his senior season, he set school records for most three-pointers in a season (107) and career (317). He ranks in Temple's all-time top ten in three-pointers attempted and three-point field goal percentage. He is also the first player to lead the Atlantic 10 in scoring for three consecutive seasons.
Professional career.
Christmas was undrafted during the 2009 NBA Draft, but on June 28, he was invited to join the Philadelphia 76ers in the Orlando Summer League. He was also invited to play with the Los Angeles Clippers in the 2009 Las Vegas Summer League. On September 29, 2009, he was signed by the 76ers, but he was waived less than a month later, on October 21, 2009.
Christmas then played professionally with Hapoel Afula in the Israeli Basketball Super League during the 2009-2010 season. Christmas also played for the Sacramento Kings in the NBA Summer League in 2010. In February 2011, he signed with ČEZ Basketball Nymburk of the Czech National League.
In April 2011, he signed with PAOK of the Greek Basket League, until the end of the season. In October 2011, he signed with the Greek League club Rethymno. In April 2012, he agreed to play with the NBA's Houston Rockets, but he ultimately did not play in any games with them.
In July 2012, he played for the Boston Celtics in both the Orlando Summer League and the Las Vegas Summer League. He signed a partially guaranteed two-year deal with the Celtics on July 31, 2012. He participated in the Celtics training camp, but on October 16, 2012, Christmas was waived by the Boston Celtics.
On October 31, 2012, Christmas signed with CSKA Moscow. He was waived in February 2013. On April 10, 2013, he signed with Montepaschi Siena of Italy.
In 2013, he joined the Utah Jazz for the Orlando Summer League and the Phoenix Suns for the Las Vegas Summer League. On September 13, 2013, Christmas signed with the Suns. On November 1, 2013, he made his NBA debut recording 9 points and 4 rebounds in close to 15 minutes of action in an 87-84 victory over the Utah Jazz.

Royal Newcastle Hospital

The Royal Newcastle Hospital was, for nearly 190 years, the main hospital in the Australian city of Newcastle. The hospital stood on a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Hunter River port of Newcastle, New South Wales, from 1817 until 2007. The hospital grew in step with Newcastle from its founding as a penal settlement and coal port. The first hospital on the site was built by and for convicts. They were followed by generations of patients, staff and supporters who were involved with an expanding seaport hospital and its many campuses. The hospital in turn had a powerful influence on the East End of central Newcastle and portside communities and on people’s wellbeing throughout the Hunter Valley. By 2007, the year the ‘Royal’ closed, this was one of the oldest, largest and best-known hospitals in Australia.
Redevelopment of the hospital site began in 2008 and, with the exception of the North Wing (opened in 1915) and the nurses' homes, much of the site was replaced by apartments. The hospital re-opened in the Royal Newcastle Centre at the site of the John Hunter Hospital in New Lambton Heights.

Anna Records recorded acts like David Ruffin, future lead singer of The Temptations, Joe Tex, Herman Griffin, Johnny Bristol and his partner Jackey Beavers (the original duo behind the Supremes' "Someday We'll Be Together"), and future Motown hit-making songwriter-producer Lamont Dozier (who went by the name Lamont Anthony at the time). They hired future Motown star Marvin Gaye as drummer for the label.
Berry produced a record on the Penny Label (part of early Anna Records) in the Spring of 1959 showcasing a white doo-wop group known as "Bryan Brent and the Cutouts". Berry had hoped that "Vacation Time", written by himself and Billy Davis, would be the hit side. However, "For Eternity", written by the Cutouts, became the summer hit and enjoyed an unprecedented #1 spot in the greater Detroit area for 8 weeks. Bryan Brent and the Cutouts performed on Soupy Sales late-night TV show and on Mickey Schorr's Detroit Bandstand TV show, as well as many radio station-sponsored dance parties, such as Tommy Clay's Sock Hop at the Light Guard Armory on 8 Mile Rd. Not restricted to white venues, the group also performed for Martha Jean "The Queen" from WJLB at many of her popular weekend dances. While Bryan Brent and the Cutouts never enjoyed the security of a contract, they did enjoy the summer of 1959. In spite of missing notations in the history books, "For Eternity" is recognized as a doo-wop classic in the US and in Europe. 
Anna Records is most notable for issuing the first national Motown hit, "Money (That's What I Want)", recorded by singer-songwriter Barrett Strong, which hit number two on the R&B chart in early 1960. The label wasn't so successful afterwards and in 1961 Anna and all its artists were absorbed by Gwen and Anna's brother Berry Gordy into Motown. Gaye, in particular, became a solo artist and signed with the corporation's oldest label Tamla while still serving as a session drummer, and Ruffin later joined The Temptations, having signed a separate contract with the Gordy subsidiary just prior to signing with Anna. Ruffin's brother Jimmy also briefly recorded for the label. 
After the label wound up, Anna Gordy joined Motown's staff writing team and Gwen later separated from Davis, going on to form a partnership with singer Harvey Fuqua, whom she married. The couple later formed Harvey Records and Tri-Phi Records. Both labels were also absorbed by Motown in 1963. Gwen and Harvey later joined the Motown songwriting staff. Davis found success as a staff songwriter for Chess Records shortly after Etta James released his co-composition, "All I Could Do Was Cry".

History.
Airtel Lanka Limited is a subsidiary of Bharti Airtel Limited, the second largest mobile operator in the world, with over 484 million mobile customers as of July 2013. Bharti Airtel has been featured in Forbes Asia's Fab 50 list, rated amongst the best performing companies in the world in the BusinessWeek IT 100 list 2007, and voted as India's most innovative company in a survey by The Wall Street Journal

Under the license, the company provides digital mobile services to Sri Lanka. This is inclusive of voice telephony, voice mail, data services and GSM based services. All of these services are provided under the airtel brand.
Airtel Sri Lanka has good coverage, except National Parks and Forests.
Network implementation.
Airtel currently uses GSM and UMTS/HSPA+ technologies.
Airtel 3.5G and 3.75G broadband and coverage.
Initially Airtel was offering cheapest Mobile broadband plans starting at 5GB for Rs.299/- but later it discontinued due lack of International bandwidth and financial loss it had incurred.
In End of 2011, airtel announced its Unlimited Mobile broadband plan for Rs.1,499 and become the best unlimited data plan in mobile market in Sri Lanka. 
airtel covers 30% of the population with 3G like Colombo, Kandy, Galle, Matara, Ampara Jaffna, Badulla, Bandarawela and airtel has covered Colombo and greater Colombo using the HSPA+ technology.
Airtel is improving their GSM coverage rapidly and they have 1600+ 2G base stations on operation island-wide and 650+ 3G base stations. Airtel started their service in Northern Sri Lanka on October 2010 and subsequently airtel broadband was available in August 2011 in Jaffna district.
Legal issues.
Airtel Sri Lanka received many legal threats from other telecommunications operators, as Airtel began offering cheaper call rates. This led the industry to a price war, and all operators, including Airtel itself, posted significant losses for 2009.
On July 15, 2010, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) implemented a price floor in order to overcome the negative effects of the price war. All operators increased their call charges, except Airtel, which filed a Fundamental Rights Petition in the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka on July 19, 2010, arguing that the floor price discriminated unfairly against the newcomer. The Supreme Court, however, rejected the petition.
Therefore, on August 3, 2010, Airtel revised its tariff for new customers, from 49 cents/min (within the network) to Rs. 1/min, with no changes to calls to outside networks, which has always been Rs. 2/min.

Treaty of Bird's Fort

The Treaty of Bird’s Fort, or Bird’s Fort Treaty was a peace treaty between the Republic of Texas and some of the Indian tribes of Texas and Oklahoma, signed on September 29, 1843. The treaty was intended to end years of hostilities and warfare between the Native Americans and the white settlers in Texas. The full title of the treaty was “Republic of Texas Treaty with the Indigenous Nations of the Delaware, Chickasaw, Waco, Tawakani, Keechi, Caddo, Anadahkah, Ionie, Biloxi, and Cherokee.”
Background.
President of Texas Sam Houston had made it one of his top priorities to end hostilities with the Indians. On July 1, 1842, Houston appointed a commission to “treat with any and all Indians on the Frontiers of Texas.” The Indians were also amenable to a treaty, having lost many of their young men in wars with the whites. In August 1842, the Indians agreed to a peace council to be held at Waco on October 26. The chiefs did not appear for that council, but on March 31, 1843, the chiefs of the nine tribes agreed to a council of peace. The council and the commissioners met six months later and concluded a peace treaty on September 29, 1843. The meeting was held and treaty was signed at Bird’s Fort on the Trinity River at present-day Arlington near Fort Worth.
The Senate of Texas ratified the treaty on January 31, 1844. President Houston signed the treaty on February 3, 1844 in Washington, Texas.
Terms of the treaty.
The treaty comprised 24 articles. A summary of the articles follows.

<doc id="20815598" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20815598" title="Shani Shingnapur">
Shani Shingnapur

Shani Shingnapur or Shani Shinganapur or Shingnapur or Sonai is a village in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Situated in Nevasa taluka in Ahmednagar district, the village is known for its popular temple of Shani, the Hindu god of the planet (graha) Saturn. Shingnapur is 35 km from Ahmednagar city.
Shingnapur is also famous for the fact that no house in the village has doors, only door frames. Despite this, no theft was reported in the village until 2010 when cash and items worth Rs. 35000/- were stolen for a vehicle, and again in 2011 when Rs. 50000/-, gold rings, mobile phone, etc. was stolen from the home of a retired official of the Shree Shanaishwar Deosthan Trust itself! Still some villagers never keep their valuables under lock and key. Villagers believe that the temple is a "jagrut devasthan" (lit. "alive temple"), meaning that the god here is very powerful. They believe that god Shani punishes anyone attempting theft. The deity here is "Swayambhu" (Sanskrit: self-evolved deity) that is self emerged from earth in form of black but imposing stone. Though no one knows the exact period, it is believed that the Swayambhu Shanaishwara statue was found from times immemorial by shepherds of the then local hamlet. It is believed to be in existence at least since Kali yuga. Though there has been reports of thefts in Oct 2010 and Feb 2011.
The village has a post office and a high school known as "Shri Shanishwar Vidya Mandir" besides the primary schools run by the Zilla Parishad. The chief source of water supply in the villages is wells.
In January 2011, the United Commercial (UCO) Bank opened a 'lockless' branch in the village, the first of its kind in the country, taking note of the near-zero crime rate in the region. The local police were reported to be unhappy over this development and that it amounted to a breach of conditions, because the Central government of India has made it mandatory for all banks to have high security.The bank has doors,but they will always remain open. However, it was reported by the local legislator and the bank officials that adequate precautions were being taken for the safety of lockers and important documents.
Historical Importance.
The story of the swayambhu statue handed down from generations through word of mouth, goes something like this: When the Shepherd touched the stone with a pointed rod, the stone started bleeding. The shepherds were astounded. Soon the whole village gathered around to watch the miracle. On that night Lord Shanaishwara appeared in the dream of the most devoted and pious of the shepherds.
He told the shepherd that he is "Shanaishwara". He also told that the unique looking black stone is his swayambhu form. The shepherd prayed and asked the lord whether he should construct a temple for him. To this, Lord Shani Mahatma said there is no need for a roof as the whole sky is his roof and he preferred to be under open sky. He asked the shephered to do daily pooja and 'Tailabhisheka' every Saturday without fail. He also promised the whole hamlet will have no fear of dacoits or burglars or thieves.
So, Lord Shanaishwara can be seen even today, in the open yard without any roof above. To this day, there are no doors for any houses, shops, temples. It is to be seen to believe that even post office has no door, not to speak of locks. Due to the fear of Lord Shani, none of the structures, be it dwelling houses, huts, shops, etc. situated within one kilometer radius of this Lord Shani temple have neither doors nor locks. No thievery or burglary was reported until 2010 when first theft was reported and again another one was reported in 2011. Some who have tried to steal have died vomiting blood within minutes of their act and before they could cross the boundary. Many others are said have received varied punishments such as long sickness, mental imbalance etc.
This Shani Shingnapur is visited daily by thousands of devotees praying for Lord Shaneswara's favour. The place is busiest on Saturdays. Shani Trayodasi is considered to be a favorite day for the lord. Similarly Saturday falling on 'Amavasya'(new moon day in Sanskrit and many other Indian languages) is considered to be a favorites day for the Lord Shanaishwara. Thousands of devotees seeking his blessings throng this temple in thousands.
Shrine of Shani.
The shrine for Shani consists of a five and a half feet high black rock installed on an open-air platform, which symbolizes the god Shani. A Trishula (trident) is placed along the side of the image and a Nandi (bull) image is on the south side. In front are the small images of Shiva and Hanuman.
Generally, the temple has 30–45000 visitors a day, which swells to around three lakh (i.e. three hundred thousand) on "amavasya" (the new moon day), believed to be the most auspicious day to appease Lord Shani. The village holds a fair in honour of the deity on this day. A bigger festival is held on new moon days that fall on Saturdays. Devotees bathe Lord Shani's image with water and oil and offer flowers, and "udid" to him. A palanquin procession of Shani is held on the day of the fair. Other festivals include the birthday of Shani, "Shani Jayanti".
The shrine gained popularity with the decade-old film "Surya Putra Shanidev" made by the film producer Late Gulshan Kumar.
Approach.
Shani Shingnapur is about from Ahmadnagar city. About northeast of Pune and from Aurangabad. The nearest airport is at Aurangabad which is from Shani Shingnapur. Nearest railway station is Srirampur. Distance from Mumbai is about by road. It can also be accessed from Shirdi, another religious place in Maharashtra. It is about 65 km on road.

<doc id="20815607" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20815607" title="Higgins Building">
Higgins Building

The Higgins Building is a proto-Modernist concrete framed building rendered in the Beaux-Arts style located in downtown Los Angeles, California. Completed in 1910 by owner Thomas Higgins, an Irish American, the 10-story building was originally used for office space. The Engineers and Architects were Albert C. Martin, Sr. and A.L. Haley. It has been designated as a historical monument by the City as Historic-Cultural Monument #873.
Although designed as an 8 story high building, it was decided during the construction stage to add 2 additional floors in order to hold the reputation as being the highest building in the city centre.
Thomas Higgins was born on 12th. July in 1844 in Boyle, County Roscommon in Ireland, son of Patrick Higgins, a farmer and Hanora Flanagan. He receive some education in Ireland. He travelled out west seeking his fortune in the late 1800s. His first stop was in Troy where he worked in some iron mines. An other member of his family, Mary Keefe (née Higgins), lived there. He worked as a lumberjack in Mosinee, Wisconsin for the years 1867-1870. He worked on dock building in Chicago which was hard heavy work which was poorly paid. On hearing that all the adventurers were heading for the Klondyke looking for gold he decided that so many guys were heading that way that there would be no gold for him. He headed south down river to St. Louis. In Louisiana he met some levee contractors from Ireland, and with them became a foreman. During the summer they worked for the Iron Mountain Railway. he then decided to head west, towards the Rocky Mountains and stayed alive by avoiding Indian attacks by not sleeping beside his open fire at night. He prospected for gold and diamonds in Oregon and Washington without much success. He heard that there were fortunes to be won in Peru and Arizona and tossed a coin to decide which direction to go. There were three towns in Arizona at that time, Tucson, Prescott and Phoenix. He reached Bisbee near the Mexican border in 1877 where he found a rich vein of copper which he worked until 1900. He sold up the mining business and moved to 1199 Magnolia Avenue in L.A. from where he ran a property business. Tom Higgins visited ireland in 1907. He was a philanthropist and supported Boyle Heights Orphanage, St. Thomas's Church in Pico Heights, and St. Vincent's College. He died after a long illness in 1920. 
The Higgins Building basement contained the city's first privately owned power plant. General Petroleum occupied six floors of the building for 15 years beginning in 1934. The building also housed the Los Angeles County Engineer Department for 25 years from 1952 until 1977. 
After spending many years derelict and underwater, the building was finally rescued by entrepreneurs Andrew Meieran and Marc Smith. Developer Barry Shy converted the upstairs offices into rental lofts in 2003 (later converted to condominiums in 2005); and Meieran and Smith opened The Edison in 2007, a post-industrial steampunk-styled nightclub in the building's basement. The building has also been a filming location for several movies and television shows.

List of Forgotten Realms nations

This is a list of fictional nations and countries from the "Forgotten Realms" setting. These nations have appeared in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting for the "Dungeons and Dragons" fantasy roleplaying game, the multiple series of novels set in the Forgotten Realms, or the numerous video and computer games set in the Forgotten Realms, or any combination thereof.
Aglarond.
Aglarond is an autocratic kingdom on the continent of Faerûn in the southwesternmost part of the Unapproachable East, with the capital of Velprintalar. It is a peninsula bordered on the west by the Sea of Fallen Stars and Altumbel and on the East by Thay. Most of its land is covered by the Yuirwood. Filled with magic and mystery, it is ruled by one of the most potent spellcasters of the Realms, the Simbul, who also has an affair with the immensely powerful archmage Elminster. On the north are the Dragonjaw Mountains. It is mostly humans who make up the nearly 1,300,000 inhabitants, though one third are half-elves and a fair number elves. This area is rumored to have once been the elven realm of Yuireshanyaar, home to the all but forgotten race of Star Elves.
Aglarond is constantly fending off attacks from Thay.
Altumbel is a "sub-peninsula"; that is, a peninsula's peninsula, which is located at the western end of the peninsula of Aglarond. Its capital is Spandeliyon, and the inhabitants distrust non-humans, especially elves. It has the reputation of being backward.
The economy is mostly fishing, but piracy is exceptionally high here and may be counted as part of the economy.
Amn.
Amn is the land of focus in the titular game "".
Amn is a place where everything is geared towards the acquisition of money, and the conspicuous consumption of the rich is evident everywhere. Conversations are filled with references to money, whether or not the current topic has any connection with financial transactions. The country was once divided, with its cities banding together only for mutual defense, while the rest of the time they struggled with each other over trade routes. During one trade war, the Council of Six, with a mysterious membership comprising some of Amn's most powerful trade houses, emerged as leaders of a united country. With the council promoting free enterprise, the making of money takes precedence over everything else, and anyone who can make money is well respected. Adventuring groups and magic-users are actively discouraged from plying their trades, unless they are properly licensed with the government.
It is a tremendously wealthy nation, holding colonies in far away Maztica and controlling important trade routes to Calimshan and Baldur's Gate. It attracts adventurers from many lands, even from outside Faerûn. Amn's capital is Athkatla, which was founded in 100 DR, which is year 0 in Amnreckoning (little used except in official documents). Major towns include "Crimmor" (pop 35,491), a walled trade hub; "Eshpurta" (pop 105,000), the main military city; "Keczulla" (pop 47,733), a gem mining town; and "Purskul" (pop 27,210), a granary city. The city of "Murann" (pop 43,773) has fallen into the hands of two Ogre mages and their forces, capturing many of the treasure ships in harbour.
Spellhold is an asylum located on the island of Brynnlaw, off the western coast of Amn, under the command of the Cowled Wizards of Athkatla, used to house the 'deviants' they have found in Amn, practicing magic without an official license.
Spellhold features strongly in the video game "".
Jim Bambra described Amn as "the kind of area that most adventuring groups will find very unhealthy".
Calimshan.
The Calim desert covers a sizable area of Calimshan, and dominates much of Calimshan's life and outlook as a result. The lands bordering it are only slightly more fertile. In Calimshan, wealth is of the utmost importance, which is sought after so that the seeker can lead a life of leisure. While few attain this goal, most Calimshanites aspire towards it. Gadgets and magical items are commonly found in Calimshan, where they are widely used as labor-saving devices. Magic-users are held in high esteem, being the providers of the much-sought-after magical devices. Calimshan is ruled by the Pasha in Calimport, although each city governs itself in practice, with the Pasha being unable to carry out any major actions without the permission of at least some of the cities' viziers. The magic-users of Calimshan have accidentally or intentionally summoned and released a substantial number of other-planar beings; after a good time running amok through their summoners’ homes and villages, those planar beings who are unable to undertake the return trip home on their own gravitate toward the Calim Desert, which they find greatly to their liking.
Successor of Coramshan, Calimshan's capital is the sprawling port-city of Calimport, home of the assassin Artemis Entreri, known for his longstanding feud with Drizzt Do'Urden in a number of novels by R.A. Salvatore. Other major cities includes Memnon and the coastal city of Schamedar.
Calimshan covers the southern corner of Faerûn, including the Calim Desert and the Spider Swamp.
This is a powerful empire; trading rivals with Waterdeep; ruled by emperor; has many powerful and wealthy "nobles" called pashas.
Jim Bambra notes that "Calimshan is a good place for magical research".
Chessenta.
Chessenta is a country of individual city-states. Apart from the most affluent city of Cimbar, an important town is Luthcheq. Its approximately 3,400,000 inhabitants are mostly humans, with halfling, dwarven, half-orc, and lizardfolk enclaves.
Chondath.
Chondath is a country with a long history, located in the Vilhon Reach on the content of Faerûn. It is located on what once was the psiocracy of Jhaamdath.
It is presently a confederation of city-states under the capital of Arrabar, but used to be a powerful nation in times long past. It has an estimated 2,000,000 inhabitants, most of whom are humans, but with elven and dwarven minorities.
Waukeen, the goddess of trade, is highly worshipped here. Other important gods are Helm, god of guardians; Lliira, goddess of joy; Malar, god of the hunt; Talos, god of storms; and Tempus, god of war. It is more or less of a plutocracy.
Reth is one of the five free cities which form the city-state of Chondath.
Damara.
Damara is a scarcely populated northern kingdom of Faerûn. Its estimated 1,300,000 inhabitants, of human, dwarven, halfling and half-orc blood, are ruled by King Gareth Dragonsbane. The main city of Damara is Heliogabalus, to the west of which lies Bloodstone Village on the border of Damara and Vaasa. While King Gareth and his court reside in Bloodstone Village, most inhabitants of Damara live in Heliogabalus.
The Dolvak Clan is a fictional clan of dwarves from the city of Iron Spur in Damara. The Dolvaks have long been known for their less than honorable business practices and extreme wealth. Strident followers of Vergadain (though "publicly" followers of Dumathoin or Moradin), the clan sends its emissaries to any and all areas within Faerûn to look for new investments, or usually, for new economies to exploit. The two most famous Dolvaks, Foilir and Dwin, were sent to the Land of Narfell where they have succeeded in becoming wildly rich and powerful.
Dambrath.
Dambrath is a land at the very south of the "Shining South" on the continent of Faerûn. The majority of the population are human peasants, but the ruling class are half-drow. The half-drow call themselves the Crinti, and they maintain close ties and trade with their drow relatives in the Upper Underdark. Tasloi are commonly encountered in this region.
Durpar.
Durpar is, together with Var the Golden and Estagund, a part of the Shining Lands. It is hardly in a good location, as it is surrounded by mountains and a sea for which it doesn't have guaranteed free access on North, East and South and by the even more dangerous Veldorn on the West. Like Var the Golden, Durpar follow the teachings of Satama, Toril's Siddharta Gautama (Bouddha) and has an Indian flavour.
Estagund.
Estagund is, alongside Durpar and Var the Golden, a part of the Shining Lands. It is modeled after an Indian culture mindset. As all Shining Lands, it is largely centered toward trading.
Halruaa.
Halruaa is a land of wizards on the continent of Faerûn. The fabled, quiet and wealthy magocracy of Halruua is justly depicted as a land of wonders. Created by archwizards foreseeing the fall of Netheril, this land combines the peace and harmony of Cormyr with the magic powers of Thay (Like Thayans, they practice circle magic and two thirds of Halruaans have magical powers of some sort).
Well protected by mountain ranges on three sides acting as natural fortifications ("Nathaghal-North Wall", "Muaraghal-East Wall", and "Lhairghal-West Wall") and the Great Sea along the south and led by a score of diviners, Halruaans live in a perfect haven. They don't really want to leave their place except for adventuring and why would they? Nowhere else in Faerûn would they find a better place than home.
The nation is divided into sections by three rivers that meet at Lake Halruaa in the center. Along its northern shores lies the small capital city of Halarahh, with around 8000 inhabitants.
Halruaa is not safe from harm, though. They are constantly under the threat of the Crinti marauders from Dambrath and next to them (although separated by a mountain range) lies Rethild, the Great (and cursed) Swamp.
Impiltur.
Impiltur is a kingdom of 1,200,000 inhabitants, mainly humans, but also dwarves and halflings, which is ruled by Queen Sambryl from the capital of Lyrabar. Many Paladins are part of Impiltur's army, the most powerful commanders mounting a legion of Bronze Dragons to protect the realm.
Lantan.
Lantan is a grouping of three remote islands north of Chult. It is populated primarily by humans and gnomes, and is thought by many to be the ancestral homeland of the gnomes. The largest and most heavily populated island is Lantan; the more mountainous southern island is Suj; and the third, almost uninhabited island, is Orlil. After Captain Cordell from Amn discovered Maztica, Lantaneses, being the westernmost extension of Faerûn (with the reclusive Evermeet and the enigmatic Nimbral), also claimed some lands.
Lantan is by far the most technologically advanced country on Faerûn, with only the technology of the eastern Shou Empire coming in a close second. After the Time of Troubles, Gond gave the gnomes of Lantan the secret of smokepowder, (Toril's black powder), and they are on the verge of inventing the printing press. Other inventions said to exist in Lantan include the steam engine and rudimentary flying machines not unlike the zeppelin. They still are a minor power, because, due to the emphasis and reliance on magic on the Realms, technology is seldom used.
Luiren.
Luiren is the land of the halflings and is a theocracy ruled by Faran Ferromar, who oversees 840,000 inhabitants, almost only made up of halflings, with a small number of humans, elves, and half-elves. Its capital is Beluir.
The city of "Delzimmer" is north of Luiren, close to the Eastern Shaar.
Moonshae Isles.
The Moonshae Isles are a group of islands in the Trackless Sea, in the west of Faerûn. They are modeled after Wales and Scotland. The islands form a roughly circular archipelago with the Sea of Moonshae in the centre. They lie roughly 400 miles (644 km) west of the region of Amn and to the southwest of the Sword Coast. The Moonshaes are ruled by the High Queen Alicia Kendrick, who rules from the capital city of Caer Callidyrr on Alaron. But this title could be disputed since the rise in 1375 of Karador and the queen self-proclamation of the leShay High Lady Ordalf.
The isles were described in "FR2, Moonshae" published in 1987 by TSR, Inc. The Moonshae Isles are the setting for "Darkwalker on Moonshae" and the Moonshae trilogy as a whole.
They have been the geographic location of multiple works of fiction and game adventure modules.
Islands.
The Moonshae Isles are bordered by several other islands, including Ruathym, the Nelanther Isles, Mintarn, and The Whalebones. The islands that make up the Moonshae Isles are as follows:
Societies.
Two major human societies populate the isles of the Moonshaes. The original human inhabitants of the islands are the Ffolk. The later arrivals are the more Viking-like Northmen, who came from the lands north of Waterdeep. The Ffolk are organized into a number of small kingdoms, loosely collected under the leadership of a High King. The High King is more of a figurehead than a true ruler, however. The Ffolk are primarily an agricultural society, though they can fight savagely when called on to defend their homes. The Ffolk are of normal stature, with light to dark hair and eyes.
The Northmen scorn agriculture in favor of raiding and making war. They have wrested much of the northern Moonshaes from the hands of the Ffolk. The remaining kingdoms of the Ffolk are the favored raiding targets of the northmen, but their adventures also carry them to the Sword Coast, and occasionally as far south as Calimshan. The Northmen are tall in height, with hair of light to dark blonde and blue eyes.
A large majority of the Ffolk worship a druidic goddess the Earthmother, an aspect of the benign goddess of agriculture, Chauntea. The Northmen worship the god Tempus, Lord of Storms and Battle.
The race of elves living on the Moonshaes is the Llewyrr. Once the dominant race on the isles, the Llewyrr now claim only small and remote portions of Gwynneth and Alaron as theirs. The Llewyrr are very similar to High Elves.
Like that of the Llewyrr, the Shield Dwarves on the Moonshaes go back a long way. These stocky and war-like demihumans have also been driven into small holdings on the isles. More numerous than the Llewyrr, the dwarves love their privacy and vigorously defend their lands against any further human encroachment.
Of all the demihumans, halflings have adapted most easily to human domination of the Moonshaes. Halfling communities are located beside most major communities of the Ffolk; some halfling towns can be found near the strongholds of the Northmen. The halflings thrive on the trade with their human neighbors and welcome the security provided by nearby castles.
There are no known communities of gnomes on the Moonshaes, but many gnomes live among the halflings and humans.
Economies of the Moonshaes.
While each Moonshae kingdom is relatively self-sufficient, a certain amount of trading nonetheless serves to supply goods that a particular nation does not
produce. This trading occurs via overland transport between kingdoms on the same island, and overseas trading of goods between the various islands and the lands along the Sword Coast. Trading partners of the Moonshae kingdoms include Calimshan, Amn, Tethyr, and Waterdeep.
Conflicts.
The Northmen are a violent, Viking-like society with little interest for or tolerance of the Ffolk's monarchical ways. This creates a continuous tension between the two human peoples, with Northmen raids on Ffolk farmsteads a common occurrence. The raids of the Northmen have gradually become oriented toward conquest, and the kingdoms of the Ffolk have succumbed one after the other to the enemy longships.
However, in recent years, the conflict between the Northmen and the Ffolk has slowed down due to the hard work of the High King Tristan Kendrick and later through his daughter, High Queen Alicia Kendrick. Through their queen's work for peaceful solutions to arguments between the Northmen and the Ffolk, the Moonshaes have enjoyed several decades of relative peace.
Magic-users are viewed with suspicion by both races, and clerics from elsewhere in the world attempt to spread their faiths in the face of druidic opposition.
The firbolgs are the scourge of the remote areas of the Moonshaes. Huge, ugly, and mean, these giants are prone to attack anything that is not of their race.
Fortunately for the other inhabitants of the isles, the firbolgs rarely leave
their remote domains. This makes them primarily a threat to those who venture
to explore these areas.
The firbolgs do, however, occasionally muster a large force and venture into
civilized areas for raiding and plunder. These outings consist mainly of slaughter and destruction as the firbolgs are not much inclined to stealing or enslaving.
The Moonshaes are also home to marauding orcs, goblins, trolls, and other more dangerous monsters.
Supernatural beings.
The Earthmother is the most important supernatural entity in the Moonshae Isles. She gives life and vitality to the land, and her power is manifested in the Moonwells. The Moonwells are pools of water with the magical power to cure the wounds of those who strive to maintain the mystic balance, and are tended by druids who can use them to charge or restore magical items.
The Earthmother's three immortal children serve her will: Leviathan, a huge whale; Kamerynnm, a majestic unicorn; and the Pack, a pack of dire wolves who roam the isles. Kazgoroth the Beast seeks to disrupt the balance and bring corruption to the Isles, and is aided by its magically created Blood Warriors: undead soldiers who obey the commands of Kazgoroth.
Mulhorand.
Mulhorand is a country located on the continent of Faerûn. Actually, Mulhorandi "are" Egyptians but, contrary to their Earth counterpart, their specific civilization never faded away and they are still building pyramids and being governed by pharaohs. They were brought to Toril by the evil Imaskar in order to help rebuild after a great plague swept through the nation. After countless praises, Lord Ao contacted Ptah who led a part of the Egyptian pantheon (actually, avatars of themselves) from Earth to Toril.
Ironically, their traditional enemy is another tribe of Mulan (the name given to the ethnic group that both nationalities belong to) who had been captured by the Imaskari at the same time, the kingdom of Unther, whose people come from ancient Mesopotamia (and thus are of Babylonian or Sumerian origin).
The Mulhorandi are esclavagists.
Murghôm.
Murghôm, inhabited by the Murghômi, is an eastern kingdom of Faerûn. It is theoretically a subject territory of Mulhorand. Its second largest city is Phannaskul and another major town is the heavily militarized Port Ghaast. It may be related to real-world Israel/Canaan, however certain details in the "Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting" sourcebook suggest that the area is likely inspired by Cossack culture. Like the Cossacks, the leaders of the Murghômi are called ataman, and the people are known for their skill with horses. Their position beside the Hordelands, which draws on the history of the Mongol Empire, also suggests the Cossacks, as does the organization of the Murghômi state as a series of “semiautonomous communities” that “gather into collective government only in times of war.” However, the Second-Edition sourcebook "The Hordelands" mentions a powerful "Bey of Murghôm," suggesting Turkish culture.
There is no mention of Beys in the Third-Edition materials. The "Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting" describes the Murghômi as speakers of Mulhorandi and believers in the Mulhorandi Pantheon, and describes Murghôm as a “daughter state.” The "Player’s Guide to Faerûn" adds that the Murghômi are ethnically Mulani, as are the Mulhorandi. The Third-Edition materials seem to suggest a mixture of Egyptian and Cossack culture that may not have a real-world equivalent.
Richard Baker, "Forgotten Realms" author and game designer, explained the Murghômi in a discussion on the Wizards Community, the official message board of Wizards of the Coast:
"They sort of remind me of the Turanians from Robert E. Howard's Hyborian Age."
"If you want a real-world parallel ... well, Cossacks aren't bad. Maybe the relationship is something like this: Murghom is to Mulhorand as Cossack is to Russia (not Turkey). Mulhorand is the imperial state that keeps trying to exert more control over its free-spirited and wild frontiersmen. But the Earth history analogy really shouldn't be taken too far. It's a fantastic world, and there should be many things in Faerûn that don’t have easy Earth analogues."
Rashemen.
Rashemen is a magocratic gynarchy, land of the famous Witches of Rashemen. Rashemen is an eastern realm of Faerûn. The 650,000 people of Rashemen are almost all humans. It is ruled from the capital of Immilmar, where the ruler called Iron Lord resides. However, the true power in Rashemen are the witches called hathran. In addition to the witches, Rashemen is also known for its berserker warriors and spirits which protect the land.
Sembia.
Sembia is a country on the continent of Faerûn. Apart from the capital of Ordulin, additional important cities in Sembia are Saerloon and Selgaunt. 
Semphar.
Semphar is the mightiest nation of the Endless Wastes, and deserves this name as it is far from Faerûn, even more than Thay. Theorically a part of the empire of "Mulhorand." Its capital is Dhaztanar, while its second largest town is Phelzel.
Sossal.
The nation of Sossal (inhabitants: Sossarhim) is a chilling place locked between Pelvuria and Yal-Tengri. There is a trade city on the Great Ice Sea called Naupau. Some say Sossarhim sometimes go to Calimshan.
Tethyr.
Tethyr is a country on the Sword Coast (western coast) of the continent of Faerûn. There is an important elven population in its forests that frequently come into conflict with the overwhelming human majority.
At the time when the country of Tethyr was detailed in "Empires of the Sands", the former royal family had all been killed, and the country had fractured into petty kingdoms, independent villages and towns, and bandit holdings. The Company of Eight is a group of eight adventurers dedicated to promoting peace in Tethyr.
The Snowflake Mountains is a mountain range in the far east of Tethyr. Not directly in the sphere of interest of any nations, the Snowflake Mountains are located between Tethyr, Amn, the Shining Plains, and the Lake of Steam. The Snowflake Mountains are best known for the "Edificant Library", a place of Deneir and Oghma worshipping, and the childhood home of Cadderly Bonaduce. It has now been magically rebuilt and is called "Spirit Soaring".
According to Jim Bambra, "With its lack of centralized government, Tethyr makes an ideal setting for power hungry adventurers".
Thay.
Thay is the magocracy of the dreaded Red Wizards. It can be considered as the evil counterpart of the magocracy of Halruaa, which makes sense, both being practitioners of circle magic. The coastal part of Thay is the Priador. Thay is constantly warring with its neighbors. Thayans practice slavery.
This region was first described in the campaign setting publication, "FR6, Dreams of the Red Wizards", published in 1988.
Thesk.
Thesk is an oligarchian region consisting of 850,000 people, inhabited by Humans, gnomes, and orcs, with no official capital; though the city-state of Phsant commonly fills that role. It is economically dependent on the city-state of Telflamm and Kara-Tur goods shipped from the far east.
Ashanath is a minor kingdom east of The Great Dale and Thesk, south of Narfell and north of Thay. Despite its fertile lands, it is at present mostly unsettled, with few resemblances of the fallen kingdom of capital city Shandaular, which was destroyed in −946 DR.
Telflamm is a large city state and a port near Thesk. Its approximately 23,500 inhabitants apparently are under the rule of a "merchant prince", though behind the scene it is the Shadowmasters, a thieves guild, who runs the city.
Turmish.
Turmish is a republic with the capital of Alaghôn, and is located in the north of the "Vilhon Reach" on the continent of Faerûn. The around 1,700,000 inhabitants are mainly humans, but dwarves are common as well, alongside minorities of halflings, elves, gnomes, half-elves and half-orcs.
Ulgarth.
Ulgarth is a country located in the Utter East, facing Var the Golden. With the free cities of Parsanic (Zendar, Dekar, Zendum, Tharkar and maybe more), it acts as a buffer between Faerûn and Zakhara.
Unther.
Unther, like its long-standing enemy, Mulhorand, was once a great empire, but now seems to be in decline. The country is a magocracy and is ruled by the Northern Wizards from the capital of Messemprar, formerly named Unthalass. It has around 4,300,000 inhabitants, consisting of mainly humans but also smaller numbers of dwarves and halflings.
Unther resembles the Mesopotamian civilization.
Vaasa.
Vaasa is a country on the continent of Faerûn. It borders on the Pelvuria, the Great Glacier, to the North, and is largely uninhabited, except for small villages of humans, dwarves, orcs and half-orcs. There is a city named Palishchuk in the Northeastern Corner, primarily inhabited by half-orcs and is in clear view of the Great Glacier. In the northernmost part of Vaasa near Palishchuk lies Castle Perilous, a remnant of the time of Zhengyi the Witch-King, that is currently inhabited by a dracolich named Urshula the Black, controlled by Bregan D'aerthe. Vaasa is bordered on the west by the Galena mountains which are nearly impassable except for a small valley in which the Barony of Bloodstone has been founded. This Barony is enclosed within the mountain range by huge walls known as the Vaasan Gate and the Damaran Gate, respective to which side of the mountain range they open up into.
Var the Golden.
Var the Golden is a peninsula at the far south-east of Faerûn. In front of it is Ulgarth. Its name comes from huge quantities of wheat fields.
Like Durpar, Var the Golden follows the teachings of Satama. Both constitute with Estagund the Shining Lands.
Veldorn.
Nicknamed as "Land of the monsters", Veldorn is a civilized country ruled by monsters.

Gerald Snyder

Gerald Theodore "Snitz" Snyder (1905 – 1983) was an American football player and Army officer. He played college football as a back for the Maryland Terrapins at the University of Maryland. Snyder played professionally for two seasons in the National Football League (NFL).
Biography.
Snyder was born on August 6, 1905 in Windber, Pennsylvania and attended high school at the Bellefonte Academy in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. He attended college at the University of Maryland, where he played football and lacrosse. In "Tales from the Maryland Terrapins", author David Ungrady credits Snyder with popularizing the fake reverse. In 1927, Snyder scored Maryland's only touchdown against Yale on a 90-yard punt return, which was the "longest run ever made in the Yale Bowl" at the time. In his senior year in 1928, Snyder was expected to be elected team captain, but had been suspended for off-field behavior by head coach Curley Byrd. Byrd believed the captaincy had become a popularity contest and elected instead to name game captains, a practice which continued for the next 15 years. That season, Snyder was named a second-team All-American in football by the Associated Press, and became just the second Maryland player to be honored as such.
In 1929, Snyder went on to play professional football in the NFL. He first played for the New York Giants, where he saw action in 12 games, including two starts, and he rushed for two touchdowns and caught one touchdown reception. In 1930, he played 11 games for the Staten Island Stapletons, including seven starts.
In 1931, Snyder received an M.A. from the University of Maryland. In 1933, he served as an assistant coach with the professional football franchise, the Frankford Legion. Snyder served in the United States Army in the Second World War and Korean War, and attained the rank of major. He died on June 28, 1983 and is interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. In 1984, Snyder was posthumously inducted into the University of Maryland Athletic Hall of Fame.

Eric Wood

Eric Wood (born March 18, 1986) is an American football center for the Buffalo Bills. He was the team's second pick in the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft (28th overall). After starting his team's first 10 games of the 2009 NFL season, he suffered a season-ending injury on November 22, 2009. Wood played his collegiate football at the University of Louisville.
High school career.
Wood attended Elder High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he played both the tackle and guard positions. His team went 28-2 over the last two seasons, including two consecutive state titles. After playing tight end as a junior, Wood started all 15 games at offensive tackle in his senior year and earned first team All-League honors.
Considered a two-star recruit by both "Rivals.com" and "Scout.com", Wood was not ranked among the nation's top offensive line prospects. He chose Louisville over Bowling Green, Ohio, Cincinnati, Indiana and Columbia.
College career.
After redshirting his initial year at Louisville, Wood started all 12 games at center for the Cardinals in 2005. He earned Freshman All-American honors by "Rivals.com", "Sporting News" and "College Football News". Also an excellent student, earned Academic All-Big East accolades as well.
Wood remained Louisville's starting center in his sophomore and junior seasons, starting all 13 and 12 games, respectively. Led by quarterback Brian Brohm, the 2007 Cardinals offense ranked sixth nationally with an average of 488.0 yards per game. Wood earned All-Big East honors in both years, and again in his senior season. He finished his career with 49 consecutive starts at center, the second-longest streak in school history behind Travis Leffew (51, 2002–05).
Professional career.
2009 NFL Draft.
Alongside Alex Mack, Wood was considered one of the best centers available in the 2009 NFL Draft. He has been compared to Brad Meester by "The Sporting News", but his instincts and "nastiness" on the field had scouts comparing him to the NFL's old time centers like Mike Webster of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tim Grunhard of the Kansas City Chiefs.
Wood was selected with the 28th pick of the 2009 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills. With Mack being selected with the 21st pick by the Cleveland Browns, at marked the first time two centers were drafted in round one since the 1983 NFL Draft, with Dave Rimington and Don Mosebar.
Buffalo Bills.
Counted on to start at right guard, Wood joined a completely retooled Bills offensive line that was expected to feature two rookie starters—him, and second round pick Andy Levitre at left guard—and no players returning at the same position. On July 28, 2009, Wood signed a five-year contract with the Bills, reportedly worth more than $12 million.
Wood immediately became the Bills starting right offensive guard next to center Geoff Hangartner, with Levitre at left guard. On November 22, 2009, in his 10th game, Wood sustained a compound fracture of the tibia and fibula in the fourth quarter of an 18–15 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, after Jaguars DT Montavious Stanley ran into Wood's leg. Wood underwent season-ending surgery in a Jacksonville hospital and did not return to Buffalo with the team. He was placed on the injured reserve list on November 24, 2009.
On March 30, 2010, Wood told the Buffalo Bills that his leg was healing well and that he gave it an 80% chance to be ready for training camp. He eventually started 14 games in the 2010 NFL season, missing only Steelers and Vikings games because of an ankle injury. The Bills were playing the same trio up the middle: Wood at right guard, Hangartner at center, and Levitre at left guard.
In 2011, Wood was switched to center, between Levitre and new starting right guard Kraig Urbik. These three have been instrumental in the resurgence in the Bills offense, led by Ryan Fitzpatrick at quarterback and Fred Jackson at running back. However, he was hurt in game 9 and did not play the rest of the year, replaced first by Urbik and then by Colin Brown.

Homestead Sports Complex

Homestead Sports Complex
is a baseball training facility located less than three miles from downtown Homestead, Florida. The facility, seats 6,500 and expands to 9,000, and provides parking for over 3,900 vehicles.
A 200 bed dormitory facility located on the grounds of the Homestead Sports Complex complements the training facilities. The dormitories consist of 30 single rooms and 84 double rooms that are complete with restrooms, showers, dressing areas, a full service kitchen and recreational areas.
History.
In 1991 the City of Homestead built the Sports Complex at a price tag of 22 million dollars in order to provide a Spring Training facility for the Cleveland Indians. The stadium was widely recognized as being state-of-the-art for the time period, as it included multiple practice facilities as well as dormatories for players. The Indians had previously played in the Cactus League in Arizona but had signed a deal to make Homestead their long-term Spring Training home. Cleveland was due to begin full-time play at the stadium in the 1993 season. In 1992 they had already began moving equipment and personnel to Florida. However, on August 24, 1992, Hurricane Andrew made landfall in Homestead as a Category 5 cyclone with winds reaching 165 mph. The stadium, directly in the path of the hurricane, was decimated. The Indians quickly began meetings with lawyers and eventually they exercised an "out clause" in the contract. 
The city decided to immediately re-construct the stadium hoping that they could have it built for the 1994 Spring Training season in order for the Indians, or perhaps another team to use. However, without a spring facility for the 1993 season Cleveland was forced to look quickly for another home. The Boston Red Sox had been using Winter Haven, Florida's Chain of Lakes Park as their training facility for 26 years. However, the Red Sox were moving to Fort Myers for the 1993 season, thus allowing the Indians to use Chain of Lakes as their spring facility in the meantime. However, knowing the situation that the Indians were in, the City allowed the team to use the stadium on the condition that they sign a 10-year contract. Cleveland had no other choice, so they signed the deal and left Homestead without a team. 
The City decided to continue re-building the stadium, assuming that at some point in the future they could lure another team to use it as their spring facility. The stadium was re-constructed in a very short period of time, as the original blueprints were kept. However, after about five years without a tenant it started to appear that the facility may never be used as a home for baseball. In the meantime, new spring training facilities were constructed such as Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter, Florida and Champion Stadium at Walt Disney World. The new stadiums began to surpass Homestead Sports Complex in terms of facility size and technology. The stadium had to look at other options in order to pay the nearly $450,000 per year in order to maintain it. 
It was offered as a home for the US Soccer Federation to conduct its training, but they declined. In 1999 the facility was used as part of the filming of the Oliver Stone movie Any Given Sunday. In 2002 an HBO series called Baseball Wives was to be primarily filmed at the Stadium, but the show was canceled before ever getting off the ground. In 2004, it served as the home of the Florida Thunder, the city's Pro Cricket team. Recently the facility has hosted local youth and adult sports on the training grounds but the internal workings of the stadium such as bathrooms, electrical and plumbing have gone into disrepair. The park had been used as a home for the City of Homestead's Fourth of July celebration until the Homestead-Miami Speedway took over the duties in 2010, attracting an exponentially larger crowd then ever before.
Future.
It remains to be seen if the stadium will ever host spring training baseball. Given the age of the stadium and the condition that it currently sits in, it would be hard to find a tenant for the facility without spending large amounts of money on updates and improvements. A portion of the facility was sold and a company called Charter Schools USA will be building a school on the grounds.

He led the 2008–09 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team in rebounding and scoring in victories over two top-five ranked teams as a college junior, which enabled them to earn a place in the national rankings for the first time in nearly three years. In addition, while the team was on the proverbial bubble, he led the team in scoring in each of the last five games before the 2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, including the only other regular season victory of the season against a ranked opponent. At the conclusion of the 2008–09 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season he was named to the second team All-Big Ten team by the media and the third team by the coaches.
Prior to the beginning of the 2009-10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, Sims was one of two members (along with Manny Harris) of the 2009–10 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team named among the 50 preseason Wooden Award watch list nominees. At the conclusion of 2009–10 Big Ten Conference regular season he was recognized as a second-team All-Big Ten selection by both the coaches and the media. Sims concluded the season as the Big Ten Conference leader in offensive rebounds.
High school.
Born in Detroit, Michigan, as the son of Lolita Pruitt and DeShawn Sims Sr. He claims to have 13 brothers and sisters. Sims starred at Detroit Pershing High School, where, as a freshman, he played the guard position. He became a starter as a sophomore and earned both "Detroit News" and "Detroit Free Press" All-Detroit, honorable mention recognition. In his junior season, he was named Associated Press Class A All-State. As a senior in the 2005–06 season, he earned Associated Press Class A Player of the Year honors. That season, he was a Jordan Brand All-American, a fourth team Parade All-American, and a unanimous Associated Press Class A All-State selection. He led his team to the Detroit Public School League championship game where they lost to Redford High School, a team that was led by junior Manny Harris, who later became Sims' teammate at Michigan. Over the course of his senior season, he averaged 25.0 points, 12.0 rebounds, 3.0 blocks and 4.0 assists. He placed third in the Hal Schram Mr. Basketball of Michigan voting, trailing David Kool and Tom Herzog. He played in various All-star games and earned the MVP of the U.S. All-Stars vs. Capital All-Stars Game in Washington, D.C. In high school, Rivals.com ranked Sims as the #6 high school power forward and #31 overall high school basketball player in the United States. Scout.com ranked Sims as the #9 high school small forward in the country. Sims is known by a nickname that has been published in the press as both Peedi and Peety.
College.
Freshman and sophomore years.
At the University of Michigan, Sims started two games as a freshman and all 32 games as a sophomore. His brother, Marcus Pruitt, who was a junior at Pershing, was fatally shot during Sims's freshman year. The following year, during the 2007-08 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, his averages jumped from 3.4 points per game to 12.3 and from 2.3 rebounds per game to 5.4. During that season, he led Michigan in rebounding and placed 14th in the Big Ten Conference, while placing 12th in the conference in scoring. This earned him an All-Big Ten honorable mention. During his sophomore year, Sims opened the John Beilein era at Michigan by earning Big Ten Player of the Week honors for the week of November 12, 2007.
Junior year.
As a junior, he became one of the leading scorers, shot blockers and rebounders in the Big Ten Conference. On November 20, 2008, the unranked Wolverines team upset the #4 ranked UCLA Bruins men's basketball team for its first win over a top-five team in eleven years. On November 29, 2008 against Savannah State, Sims posted game-highs of 23 points and 12 rebounds, including an overtime buzzer beater as Michigan overcame a 20 point half time deficit. Sims, served as sixth man during November, led the team in scoring with 18 points and tied for the lead in rebounds. On December 3, Sims entered the starting lineup during a game against Maryland in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge. On December 6, 2008 Michigan posted its second consecutive win over a top 5 opponent in a rematch against the #4 ranked Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team. Sims again, led the team in scoring with a career-high 28 points and posted a team-high with 12 rebounds. On December 22, 2008 Sims became the first Wolverine to score 20 points and add 20 rebounds since Phil Hubbard had 22 points and 26 rebounds in a victory over University of Detroit in the 1977 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. As a result of the major victories and continuing team success they reached the top 25 in the national rankings on December 22 for the first time since February 6, 2006. On February 26, he was the high scorer again with a career-high 29 points in game against the #16-ranked Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team that Michigan won 87–78, raising its record to 3–4 against ranked opponents on the season. At the conclusion of the 2008–09 Big Ten Conference men's basketball regular season, he was named to the second team All-Big Ten team by the media and the third team by the coaches.
Sims led the team in scoring in six of its last seven games including five consecutive games covering the last three regular season games and both 2009 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament games. Sims led the Wolverines in field goal percentage, rebounds and blocked shots. He finished second on the team in minute played, steals and points per game. Sims ended the season fifth in rebounds per game, fifth in points per game and eighth in field goal percentage, eleventh in block shots per game and fifteenth in steals per game in the Big Ten Conference. After, Harris was named team MVP, he requested that Sims be recognized as co-MVP. Sims was recognized as co-MVP.
Senior year.
Harris and Sims were named among the 50 preseason Wooden Award watch list nominees. Sims became the second Wolverine to earn Big Ten Player of the Week during the 2009–10 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season for his efforts during week nine (January 4–10). As the season progressed, Sims was called on to take decisive shots in a few close games: On January 26, he attempted an alley oop with 0.9 seconds remaining as Michigan trailed by one point against Michigan State, and on February 16, he made a game-tying three point shot against Iowa with 6.1 seconds remaining to enable Michigan to emerge victorious in overtime. At the conclusion of the regular season, he was named a second-team All-conference selection by both the coaches and the media. He was also recognized as Michigan's Big Ten Sportsmanship Awards honoree. He was recognized as an All-District second-team selection by the National Association of Basketball Coaches making him eligible for the State Farm Division I All‐America teams.
Sims led the conference in offensive rebounds and ranked fifth in scoring. He was also among the leaders in field goal percentage (14th) and steals (15th). Sims was undrafted in the 2010 NBA Draft.
Professional career.
After going undrafted in the June 24, 2010 NBA Draft, Sims signed a free agent contract with the Boston Celtics. Sims played in four games for the Celtics in the Orlando Summer League and then four games for the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Summer League.
In August 2010 he signed with Greek club PAOK BC. On November 2, he left PAOK, after having played 3 games with the Greek team, in which he averaged 12.3 PPG in 21.7 minutes. Later that month, Sims signed with the Maine Red Claws of the NBA Development League, who are the D League affiliate of the Celtics. He earned a selection to the 2011 D-League All-Star game. In the game, he posted 20 points. Over the course of the season, he finished fourth in the league with a 20.3 points per game as well as 7.7 rebounds. Along the way he posted 13 double doubles and earned the 2011 NBA Development League Rookie of the Year Award. In April 2011 he signed with Piratas de Quebradillas in Puerto Rico. In July 2011 during the 2011 NBA lockout, he signed with Jeonju KCC Egis in South Korea. On March 6, Sims rejoined the Red Claws, replacing Dominic Calegari on the roster. Sims posted a 12-point and 15-rebound double double for the Red Claws on March 10 against the Canton Charge. He last appeared in a game for the Red Claws on March 16 against the Austin Toros. On March 21, he was reported to have an ankle injury.
In July 2012, Sims was named to the Phoenix Suns roster for the 2012 Las Vegas Summer League. In September 2012, he signed with Hekmeh of the Lebanese Basketball League. He posted 22.5 points and 8.3 rebounds per game in Lebanon, while shooting 36.4% on his three-point shots. Sims was expected to join the Boston Celtics' 2013 Orlando Summer League team. However, he was not on the summer roster.
On September 30, 2013, Sims signed with the Boston Celtics. He was one of four nonguaranteed training camp invites (along with Damen Bell-Holter, Kammron Taylor and Chris Babb), vying for the final roster spot after accounting for the 14 guaranteed contracts. He was one of three small forwards invited to camp, along with Jeff Green, Gerald Wallace. On October 26, 2013, he was waived by the Celtics who waived all four nonguaranteed invitees reducing their roster to 14. After waiving the four players, Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge said all four were welcome to join the team's D-League affiliate, Maine Red Claws, if they were willing to accept the low paying salary instead of higher paying offers overseas. Sims was the only one of the four who did not sign with the Red Claws by the end of the month. That year, he went on to sign with Hapoel Gilboa Galil of the Israeli Basketball Super League.

Lubi Kui

Lubi Kui (, 17 September 1886 — 9 July 1941) was a Chinese educationist and publisher. Lubi (陸費) was his family name. His courtesy name was Bo hong (伯鸿). He is known in his advocacy for simplified Chinese characters.
Early life.
Lubi was born in a noble family in Hanzhong, Shaanxi, though his parents had come from Zhejiang. His mother was a niece of Li Hongzhang, a famous Chinese politician during the Qing Dynasty. In his early years, Lubi was taught in classical Chinese. Beginning in 1898, he attended to Nanchang English School (南昌英语学塾) and started to learn English and Japanese. He was influenced by new thought and thus pro-revolutionary.
Career.
In the spring of 1903, Lubi went to Wuchang, where he launched "Xinxuejie Bookstore"(新学界书店). As the manager, he sold many pro-revolution books and booklets. He joined the underground revolution movement and became a surveillant. In 1905 he became the editor-in-chief of the newspaper Chubao(《楚报》) and after the closing down of the newspaper under the pressure of Governor Zhang Zhidong he fled to Shanghai. There, he was employed as the manager and editor of a publishing company. In late 1906, Lubi became the headmaster of Wenming Primary School. He started to make a figure in Shanghai. [http://chinese.cersp.com/sJdcd/sJyjd/200802/6575.html]
In 1908, Lubi started the first professional magazine in education in China, the "Jiaoyu Zazhi". Lubi believed that education is the key in making a better nation. He published many essays and thesis on the magazine to introduce his ideas in education reforming.
In 1909, Lubi published a thesis titled "General Education Should Use Vernacular Characters"(《普通教育应当采用俗体字》）, on Jiaoyu Zazhi. This is the first time in history to advocate the promotion of simplified Chinese characters. In 1922, Lubi published another thesis "Deliverance on Coordinating Chinese Characters"(《整理汉字的意见》), in which he suggests that educators should respect the simplified characters invented by the folk and should adopt these characters in their teaching. He also proposes to simplify complex characters systematically. [http://www.xys.org/fang/doc/history/jianhua.txt]
Lubi is also known as the founder of Zhonghua Book Company（中華書局）, one of the most influential contemporary publishing company in classical Chinese and Chinese historical publication. In the 1930s, Zhonghua was the most successful publishing company in East Asia. By the Second Sino-Japanese War, the annual income of Zhonghua was over 10,000,000 yuan and had over 40 branches throughout China. In Shanghai and Hong Kong, it had over 3,000 employees. Under the management of Lubi, Zhonghua published a series of important books for Chinese cultural and historical studies, such as Cihai(《辞海》), Gujin Tushu Jicheng(《古今图书集成》）, etc. [http://www.zhbc.com.cn/enindex.asp]
During the war, due to the his influence, Lubi's life was threatened by Japanese agencies. He moved the headquarter of Zhonghua to Kunming. Then he went to Hong Kong in order to produce enough books for the endangered nation.
Death.
In 1941, Lubi died of cerebral hemorrhage.

Benton County Wind Farm

The Benton County Wind Farm (also called Goodland I) consists of 87 model sl/sle Gen4 GE 1.5 MW wind turbines near Earl Park, Indiana in northern Benton County, Indiana. The farm's nameplate capacity is 130.5 MW. The farm was developed by Orion Energy Group, LLC (Oakland, CA) and Vision Energy, LLC (Cincinnati, OH) beginning in 2003. It began commercial operation in April 2008. At the time of its construction, it was Indiana's only commercial-scale wind farm. Duke Energy purchases electricity from the wind farm and sells it to customers through its GoGreen program.
In August 2006, Duke Energy Indiana finalized its agreement to buy the output of 54 of the wind farm's 87 wind turbines for 20 years. This was the first significant long-term wind power purchase agreement in Indiana. The remaining 33 wind turbines in the wind farm sell their electricity to Duke and Vectren.
The owner of the project is Benton County Wind Farm LLC, which is owned by subsidiaries of Orion Energy Group LLC and other investors. The project is managed by Orion Energy Group LLC.
In early 2009, the nearby Fowler Ridge Wind Farm was Indiana's second wind farm to open, and became Indiana's largest wind farm.
Other wind farms developed by Orion and Vision include the Camp Grove Wind Farm and the Fowler Ridge Wind Farm.

<doc id="20815865" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20815865" title="Closure problem">
Closure problem

In graph theory and combinatorial optimization, a closure of a directed graph is a set of vertices with no outgoing edges.
The closure problem is the task of finding the maximum-weight or minimum-weight closure in a vertex-weighted directed graph.
It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem. It may be used to model various application problems of choosing an optimal subset of tasks to perform, with dependencies between pairs of tasks, one example being in open pit mining.
Algorithms.
Condensation.
The maximum-weight closure of a given graph "G" is the same as the complement of the minimum-weight closure on the transpose graph of "G", so the two problems are equivalent in computational complexity.
If two vertices of the graph belong to the same strongly connected component, they must behave the same as each other with respect to all closures: it is not possible for a closure to contain one vertex without containing the other. For this reason, the input graph to a closure problem may be replaced by its condensation, in which every strongly connected component is replaced by a single vertex.
The condensation is always a directed acyclic graph.
Reduction to maximum flow.
As showed,
a maximum-weight closure may be obtained from "G" by solving a maximum flow problem on a graph "H" constructed from "G" by adding to it two additional vertices "s" and "t". For each vertex "v" with positive weight in "G", the augmented graph "H" contains an edge from "s" to "v" with capacity equal to the weight of "v",
and for each vertex "v" with negative weight in "G", the augmented graph "H" contains an edge from "v" to "t" whose capacity is the negation of the weight of "v". All of the edges in "G" are given infinite capacity in "H".
A minimum cut separating "s" from "t" in this graph cannot have any edges of "G" passing in the forward direction across the cut: a cut with such an edge would have infinite capacity and would not be minimum. Therefore, the set of vertices on the same side of the cut as "s" automatically forms a closure "C". The capacity of the cut equals the weight of all non-negative vertices minus the weight of the vertices in "C", which is minimized when the weight of "C" is maximized. By the max-flow min-cut theorem, a minimum cut, and the optimal closure derived from it, can be found by solving a maximum flow problem.
Alternative algorithms.
Alternative algorithms for the maximum closure problem that do not compute flows have also been studied. Their running time is similar to that of the fastest known flow algorithms.
Applications.
Open pit mining.
An open pit mine may be modeled as a set of blocks of material which may be removed by mining it once all the blocks directly above it have been removed. A block has a total value, equal to the value of the minerals that can be extracted from it minus the cost of removal and extraction; in some cases, a block has no extraction value but must still be removed to reach other blocks, giving it a negative value.
One may define an acyclic network that has as its vertices the blocks of a mine, with an edge from each block to the blocks above it that must be removed earlier than it. The weight of each vertex in this network is the total value of its block, and the most profitable plan for mining can be determined by finding a maximum weight closure, and then forming a topological ordering of the blocks in this closure.
Military targeting.
In military operations, high-value targets such as command centers are frequently protected by layers of defense systems, which may in turn be protected by other systems. In order to reach a target, all of its defenses must be taken down, making it into a secondary target. Each target needs a certain amount of resources to be allocated to it in order to perform a successful attack. The optimal set of targets to attack, to obtain the most value for the resources expended, can be modeled as a closure problem.
Transportation network design.
The problem of planning a freight delivery system may be modeled by a network in which the vertices represent cities and the (undirected) edges represent potential freight delivery routes between pairs of cities. Each route can achieve a certain profit, but can only be used if freight depots are constructed at both its ends, with a certain cost. The problem of designing a network that maximizes the difference between the profits and the costs can be solved as a closure problem, by subdividing each undirected edge into two directed edges, both directed outwards from the subdivision point. The weight of each subdivision point is a positive number, the profit of the corresponding route, and the weight of each original graph vertex is a negative number, the cost of building a depot in that city. Together with open pit mining, this was one of the original motivating applications for studying the closure problem; it was originally studied in 1970, in two independent papers published in the same issue of the same journal by J. M. W. Rhys and Michel Balinski.

Sickle Cell Anemia, a Molecular Disease

"Sickle Cell Anemia, a Molecular Disease" is a 1949 scientific paper by Linus Pauling, Harvey A. Itano, Seymour J. Singer and Ibert C. Wells that established sickle-cell anemia as a genetic disease in which affected individuals have a different form of the metalloprotein hemoglobin in their blood. The paper, published in the November 25, 1949 issue of "Science", reports a difference in electrophoretic mobility between hemoglobin from healthy individuals and those with sickle-cell anemia, with those with sickle cell trait having a mixture of the two types. The paper suggests that the difference in electrophoretic mobility is probably due to a different number of ionizable amino acid residues in the protein portion of hemoglobin (which was confirmed in 1956 by Vernon Ingram), and that this change in molecular structure is responsible for the sickling process. It also reports the genetic basis for the disease, consistent with the simultaneous genealogical study by James V. Neel: those with sickle-cell anemia are homozygous for the disease gene, while heterozygous individuals exhibit the usually asymptomatic condition of sickle cell trait.
The paper introduced the concept of a "molecular disease", and is considered a major impetus to the development of molecular medicine. The paper helped establish that genes control not just the presence or absence of enzymes (as genetics had shown in the early 1940s) but also the specific structure of protein molecules. It was also an important triumph in the efforts of Pauling and others to apply the instruments and methods of the physical sciences to biology, and Pauling used it promote such research and attract funding.
Caltech work.
Linus Pauling was a prominent physical chemist at the California Institute of Technology (a main focal point of Warren Weaver's efforts to promote what he called "molecular biology" through Rockefeller Foundation grants). In the mid-1930s, Pauling turned his attention to the physical and chemical nature of hemoglobin. In 1946, he set graduate student Harvey Itano (who had been previously trained as a physician) the task of finding differences in hemoglobin that might explain sickle cell disease. After failing to find any differences in size, weight, or acid-base titration (despite the advanced instruments available at Caltech), Itano found that oxygen could inhibit the sickling process while various reducing agents could speed it up; this was the basis of Pauling and Itano's first publication on the disease. Itano also found that the globin portion of sickle cell hemoglobin had a barely detectable difference in electrical charge.
In order to measure this difference precisely, Pauling assigned graduate student John Singer to work with Itano and another medical researcher, Ibert C. Wells, on using a "Tiselius Apparatus" to perform free-boundary electrophoresis, before leaving in early 1948 for a guest lectureship in England. Using the electrophoresis technique, Pauling's researchers were able to estimate that molecules of sickle-cell hemoglobin had about three more positive charges than normal hemoglobin. They also estimated that blood from those with sickle cell trait was a mixture of 60 percent normal hemoglobin and 40 percent sickle-cell hemoglobin. Near the end of the project, they learned of parallel results by geneticist James V. Neel, who demonstrated the inheritance pattern of the disease by traditional genetic methods; both Neel's work and that of Pauling's group were published in the same issue of "Science".
Follow-up work.
Following the 1949 paper, Itano left the Pauling laboratory to work with Neel; in the following years they used electrophoresis to identify a number of other human hemoglobin variants, including some associated with other diseases. At Caltech, a comparison of the amino acid content of normal and sickle cell hemoglobins showed that they had several differences in chemical makeup, but did not explain the difference in electric charge that made electrophoretic separation possible. The cause of this difference was pinpointed in 1956 and 1957, when Vernon Ingram used protein fingerprinting to show that the key difference between normal hemoglobins and sickle cell hemoglobins was a single difference in one chain of the protein: a glutamic acid residue on the normal hemoglobin in place of a valine residue on the sickle cell hemoglobin.
The molecular disease concept put forward in the 1949 paper also became the basis for Linus Pauling's view of evolution. In the 1960s, by which time it had been shown that sickle cell trait confers resistance to malaria and so the gene had both positive and negative effects and demonstrated heterozygote advantage, Pauling suggested that molecular diseases were actually the basis of evolutionary change. He also advocated eugenic policies, such as marking all who carry the sickle cell trait and other molecular disease genes, to reduce the number of children born with genetic diseases.

Cody Brown

Cody Dion Brown (born November 9, 1986) is an American football linebacker who is currently a member of the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. He was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in the second round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He played college football at Connecticut.
He has also been a member of the Detroit Lions, New York Jets & Calgary Stampeders.
Early years.
Brown attended Coral Springs High School, where he made 88 tackles and had nine quarterback sacks as a senior. He was named first team All-Broward County and honorable mention All-State.
Considered a two-star recruit by "Rivals.com", Brown was not ranked among the best defensive end prospects in the nation.
College career.
Cody Brown was a three-year starter at defensive end and a team captain for the Huskies during his senior season. In 2005, he became the first true freshman lineman to start a game after Connecticut's upgrade to Division 1-A. He was named starter for the Huskies during his sophomore season, and has since started every game in which he participated. In his final two seasons as a Husky, Brown registered a total of 18.5 sacks and 33 tackles for loss and he was named to the First Team All-Big East at defensive end after his senior season.
Professional career.
Arizona Cardinals.
Picked 63rd overall by the Arizona Cardinals, Brown was the last of four former Huskies to be taken from in the first two rounds of the 2009 NFL Draft. The Cardinals selection of Brown, together with the New England Patriots and New York Giants respective second round draft picks, Darius Butler and William Beatty, and first round Indianapolis Colts selection Donald Brown, established an unprecedented UConn football presence in the NFL draft; by the end of the second round, the only school that exceeded UConn's four picks—by one pick—was USC. Brown suffered a wrist injury during the 2009 preseason and was placed on season-ending injured reserve on August 24. Brown would be waived by the team on September 3, 2010.

Chronotron

Chronotron is a flash video game developed by Scarybug Games.
"Chronotron" launched on the Kongregate website in May 2008.
It is notable for having been selected as one of ten games in the PAX 10 2008 out of over eighty entries.
It has been described as innovative.
The protagonist is a robot named Chronotron which travels back in time to cooperate with himself.
The main character must fetch an item before moving to the next room.
Solving the puzzles requires sending the main character back in time to coordinate with previous selves.
The gameplay requires thinking ahead.
"Chronotron" records the control input, not the protagonist's position.
As a result, actions by later selves can interfere with earlier selves. 
A number of web sites have licensed "Chronotron", including Kongregate and MTV's AddictingGames. It was featured on the front page of Kongregate.
The game appears on over 2,000 web sites
and has been played more than seven million times.
The developer splits advertising revenue evenly with Kongregate and has made more than $1,000. The developer has made nearly $15,000 in profits from the game.
Development.
"Chronotron" was developed by Madison, Wisconsin based Scarybug Games, which consists of a single person: Joe Rheaume.
Rheaume was the sole developer of "Chronotron".
Development for "Chronotron" took seven months.
"Chronotron"'s sponsorship support was handled through FlashGameLicense.com.
Interest in sponsoring "Chronotron" allowed Scarybug Games to hire Romanian artist Bogdan Ene to replace the graphics.
Royalty free music was purchased for the game.
The music's author is Helge Krabye.
Sound effects came from the Freesound Project.
"Chronotrons time travel elements was inspired by advertising for the Xbox game ' and an article on "Braid".
Rheaume claims to not have played "Blinx".
"Chronotron" was released before the release of "Braid".
Rheaume claims to have "thought of the idea of recording input and going back looping on yourself."
Rheaume wanted there to be no limit on how many times you could travel back in time.
The game contains references to time travel stories including "Back to the Future", "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure", and "Doctor Who".
The puzzle platformer elements were inspired by "The Lost Vikings".
Rheaume notes the similarity between cooperating with your self to the cooperation between the three Vikings in "The Lost Vikings".
Puzzle pacing, with later puzzles building on what is learned earlier, was inspired by "Portal".
"Portal" also inspired the use of humorous signs in game as hints.
Rheaume is a Flash developer for his day job.
Chronotron was built as a hobby.
As a hobby, Rheaume can develop ideas which don't fit the ideas, time constraints, and budgets of his regular job's client projects.
Chronotron was developed because Rheaume thought it would be fun to play.
Rheaume developed it further because he "thought it really had legs."
Interest from other people kept Rheaume going.
The name of the game and the protagonist comes from "chrono" for "time" and "tron" as a generic term for "robot."
Reception.
The game was selected as one of the ten games for the prestigious PAX 10 in 2008.
Joe Rheaume was an invited guest to show Chronotron to the Penny Arcade Expo in 2008 as part of the PAX 10.
"Chronotron" was selected as one of ten games from over eighty submitted.
"Chronotron" is the only browser-based Flash game in the PAX 10 2008.
"Chronotron" has been described as "a very deep, complex game involving time travel and past selves."
Game designer Greg Costikyan described "Chronotron" as "a simple, satisfying, and enjoyable exploration of the effects of one novel mechanic on a well-established form."
A review on Jay Is Games described "Chronotron" as "a platform puzzler with a really innovative (and addictive) twist." 
The same review said of the "rewind mechanic", "the concept is refined—and executed almost to perfection."
A reviewer on "Rock, Paper, Shotgun" said "Certainly I feel worn out after wrapping my head around a few levels, but also satisfied and pleased — you really should go play this."
Kotaku called it "a hell of a fun flash game."
Gawker.com rated "Chronotron" "Pretty pretty good" and said "If you loved Portal, you'll like this enough for two lunch breaks."
Jamie Fristrom of Torpex Games, a fellow honoree at the PAX 10, said, "Chronotron is actually my favorite of the PAX 10."
A GameCyte author "wholeheartedly recommend Chronotron to any and all puzzle fans."
Hecklerspray described "Chronotron" as "incredible" and "so impressively playable that it'll probably kill your productivity for the day stone dead."
The developer believes the "biggest" and "fairest criticism" are problems with synchronizing robots actions between time loops.

Resurrector

Resurrector (born Grant McDonald Chambers, 10 May 1971 in New Haven, CT) is an electronic music producer best known as founder of Colorado/San Francisco Dub Hop band Heavyweight Dub Champion. He is the co-producer of both Heavyweight Dub Champion studio albums and is main creator of the band's philosophical ideology defined by the "Last Champion Manifesto", a booklet included with the 2002 album, "Survival Guide For The End of Time". Resurrector now lives in San Francisco, CA and performs and produces for Heavyweight Dub Champion, Liberation Movement and Jillian Ann, among others.
Biography.
Resurrector grew up mostly near Baltimore, MD, but lived in multiple countries where his father, a college professor, had visiting fellowships. Resurrector attended University at McDaniel College in Maryland, Harlaxton College in Grantham, England and received a degree in Religious Studies from University of Colorado at Boulder. As a teen, Resurrector promoted punk concerts and frequented the D.C. punk scene. In 1995, while living in Boulder, Colorado, he founded hip hop reggae group "Roots Revolt". Many of the key players in "Roots Revolt" would later show up on Heavyweight Dub Champion recordings, including HDC co-founder Patch Rubin. Heavyweight Dub Champion was founded in Gold Hill, CO in 1997 and played its first show on October 31, 1997. In 2005, the band relocated to San Francisco. On July 7, 2007 Resurrector married musician/model Jillian Ann and they have multiple music projects together including Liberation Movement.
Ideology.
Resurrector focuses on ideological perspectives in many of his interviews on behalf of Heavyweight Dub Champion. He often speaks about music being "Sonic Shamanistic Alchemy" and the members of Heavyweight Dub Champion are often referred to as "Sonic Shamanistic Alchemists". He defines the process as, "basically taking a range of vibrational materials, from tribal instruments to electronic instruments, and manipulating them through devices like tape delays and old analog stomp boxes to try to find the personality of each piece... looking for particular voices, particular vibrations that would contribute to the spectrum of sound we're trying to bring forth, a spectrum of liberational revolutionary energy. Whatever we do with a sound, we have a specific mission: to change the chemistry of the planet leading to unconditional liberation of the human race." A defining quotation written by Resurrector that is often used to represent Heavyweight Dub Champion is "the liberation process is in full effect".
Last Champion Manifesto.
"Penned just hours after the arrival of the new millennium", the "Last Champion Manifesto" is 70 page document "steeped in allegory and at times reading like ancient scripture", according to The Source Weekly. The LA Weekly calls it a "bible/babble manifesto" and the Denver Westword refers to it as a "scripturally spirited rant." The Westword reports that, at an early age, Resurrector received visions from the "Last Champion" during periods of "severe headaches and lengthy vomiting sessions." The "Last Champion Manifesto" serves as the ideological foundation of both the album "Survival Guide for the End of Time" and the band Heavyweight Dub Champion as a whole- "We're a concept band. Everything we do is related to the manifesto. Every album will be that way," says Resurrector. There are seven chapters broken into mini-chapters named after the songs on "Survival Guide" and 2008's "Rise of the Champion Nation". Each album serves as a sort of soundtrack to elements presented in the booklet. Songs relate to actions such as the "Arrival", which was remixed by San Francisco's award winning favorite Bassnectar, "Liberation Process", "Exorcism" and so on. Most of the themes relate to becoming a Warrior and the development of the "Last Champion's Chosen Army" known as "Champion Nation", which is also the name of the record label founded by Resurrector.

It drew wide support from a largely agrarian society, in which neither religion nor caste was a factor and the legendary Jharkhande Rai represented the aspirations of the toiling masses.

The National Human Rights Commission of the Republic of Korea (NHRCK) was established on November 25, 2001 under the National Human Rights Commission Act. Fulfilling an election pledge of then-President and 2000 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Kim Dae-Jung, the Commission was launched as an independent governmental body. It does not belong to any of the legislative, judiciary, and executive branches of the Korean government. And it functions in accordance with the Principles relating to the status and functioning of national human rights institutions for protection and promotion of human rights ("Paris Principles") adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1993.
The NHRCK has been a full member of the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions (APF) and the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (ICC) since 2002.

Street Hero

Street Hero is a 1984 Australian film directed by Michael Pattinson and starring Vince Colosimo, Sigrid Thornton, Sandy Gore, Bill Hunter and Ray Marshall. The film won an AFI award.
The film received a M classification for moderate violence and moderate course language.
Plot.
Vinnie is a teenage boy who is an outcast at school, alienating teachers and students alike. He is a local courier for the local Mafia boss. He lives in welfare housing with his mother (Peta Toppano), a young brother and sister, and his Mum's lover who he can't stand. Vinnie takes out his aggression with the world practicing boxing at the local gym. He is haunted by images of his father (when just a boy he witnessed his father's murder) and his father's boxing career. His music teacher (Sandy Gore) encourages him to get involved as a drummer with the school band, and his girlfriend Gloria (Sigrid Thornton) and others influence him to stay away from the Mafia.
Awards.
Street Hero was nominated for seven AFI awards in 1984 including Best Actor (Vince Colosimo), Best Supporting Actress (Sandy Gore), Best Supporting Actress (Peta Toppano), Best Original Screenplay (Jan Sardi), Best Original Music Score (Garth Porter), although it only won Best Achievement in Sound.
Production.
Colosimo, Sardi and Pattinson had previously made "Moving Out" (1982). When making that film Sardi and Pattinson discovered music teachers would help underprivileged children by encouraging them to become involved in music, which inspired this film. Pattinson took the script to Bonnie Harris of Roadshow Entertainment, who got Paul Dainty involved.
The movie was a conscious effort on the part of Pattinson and Sardi to make something more commercial than their first film, while still having something based in reality. The director later admitted that the choice of music used in the film - including Leo Sayer, Sharon O'Neill and Dragon - was "maybe a bit too middle of the road".
Box office.
"Street Hero" took in $729,344 (AUS) at the box office, making it the 203rd most successful Australian Film (1996–2008).

Hraše, Medvode

Hraše () is a settlement in the Municipality of Medvode in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia.
Name.
Hraše was first attested in written sources in 1118 as "Grasach" (and as "Grosschach" in 1436 and "Krasach" and "Chrasach" in 1499). These are all locative forms of the name. The name "Hraše" is derived from the plural demonym "*Hrasťane", in turn derived from the word "hrast" 'oak'. Like similar names (e.g., "Hrastje, Hrastovica, Hrastnik"), it originally referred to the local vegetation. In the 19th century the German name was "Hrasche".
Church.
The local church, built outside the main settlement, is dedicated to Saint James. It was first mentioned in documents dating to 1118, when it was granted baptism and burial rights. The current building dates to the late 15th century but was later remodelled in the Baroque fashion. The nave is rib vaulted and the sanctuary ceiling has a star vault. The main altar dates to 1647. The side altars are dedicated to Saint Anne and Saint Anthony the Hermit.

South Bristol Community Hospital is a community hospital in the Hengrove area of Bristol, England, on the site of the former Whitchurch Airport. It opened in March 2012.
History.
Planning permission for the hospital was granted in March 2008.
The NHS South West board approved the £54 million facility in January 2009. Final go ahead was given in early 2010.
The ground-cutting ceremony was held on 5 March 2010. Construction, which cost £45 million, was completed in the spring of 2012, although not all services were operating in March 2012.
The hospital will provide a Minor Injuries Unit, an out-of-hours GP service, day surgery facilities, stroke rehabilitation, medical imaging and dental facilities.
It replaces outdated facilities at Bristol General Hospital.
The hospital was developed by NHS Bristol in conjunction with Bristol Infracare LIFT Ltd, a public-private partnership setup to provide new healthcare facilities in Bristol.
The hospital is a key part of the Hengrove Park Regeneration Project that will include a new Skills Academy, a sports and leisure centre, corporate headquarters and transport infrastructure improvements. There has been debate about a new hospital for South Bristol for a considerable time. The last plans by Bristol and Weston Health Authority were shelved in the late 1980s. The current development comes from plans instituted by "Bristol Health Services Plan" in 2000.
On 7 January 2013, Bristol Homeopathic Hospital moved its operations from Cotham House to the hospital.

Phenyldichloroarsine

Phenyldichloroarsine, NATO abbreviation PD, is an organic arsenical vesicant and vomiting agent developed by Germany and France for use as a chemical warfare agent during World War I. The agent is known by multiple synonyms and is technically classified as a vesicant, or blister agent.
History.
PD was prepared during 1917-18 in Germany and France, during World War II it was prepared in Germany. 
Chemical characteristics.
General.
Phenyldichloroarsine is an odorless, colorless substance that can form hydrochloric acid upon contact with water. The reaction with water is very slow, the substance sinks, and the reaction is considered non-hazardous. Another product of hydrolysis is phenylarsenious acid, which is a severe irritant to the mucous membranes and skin. In an impure state, phenyldichloroarsine may have a slight brown color, in its purest form though there is no color and the substance has an oily texture. An impure solution of PD also emits a characteristically unpleasant horseradish or garlic-like odor, which is detectable at 0.1 ppm.
Phenyldichloroarsine is one of four organic arsenicals, the other three are lewisite (L), methyldichloroarsine (MD),and ethyldichloroarsine (ED). PD is considered an analog of lewisite. At its freezing point, -20 °C, PD becomes a microcrystalline solid mass. The compound has a C-metalloid bond between the phenyl group and the arsenic and two covalent bonds between the arsenic and the chlorine.
Synthesis.
Phenyldichloroarsine is produced by reacting benzene with arsenic trichloride. Anhydrous aluminum chloride acts as a catalyst in this reaction.
Uses.
Phenyldichloroarsine is an obsolete chemical warfare agent and is classified as a vesicant or a vomiting/incapacitating agent. It was used as a weapon during World War I, where it showed itself as less effective than other vomiting agents. Phenyldichloroarsine is an arsenical vesicant which can be mixed with mustard agents for use in chemical warfare.
PD was developed for use in wet environments, because of its tendency to persist in cool and shaded areas. Phenyldichloroarsine can have a persistence lasting anywhere from 2 to 7 days under usual environmental conditions. In open areas, it is more useful as a vomiting agent but in closed-in areas, such as basements, trenches and caves, it is highly effective because of its "extreme" vapor density. Phenyldichloroarsine has also been used by banks and other high-security facilities to defend against security breaches.
Biological effects.
PD damages the eyes, lungs, throat and nasal membranes. PD immediately affects the eyes and blindness can result, though it requires high doses. It also induces nausea and vomiting, an inhalation of as little as 5-50 milligrams can induce severe vomiting. Long-term exposure to PD can cause systemic damage by replacing calcium with arsenic, extensive bone marrow damage can also result. Due to PD being easily recognized in the field and a relatively fast rate for decontamination procedures to become effective, the chemical is not as useful as other blister agents. The blistering resultant from PD exposure may also be delayed, for as little as 30 minutes, or as long as 32 hours depending upon the concentration of the dose.
The molecular toxicology of PD is not well understood, but a 1986 U.S. Army-sponsored report did shed some light on that area. The Army report showed that PD penetrated the red blood cell membrane and interacted with something inside the cell. The study also found that hemoglobin was not responsible for "holding" the PD in its bond with the erythrocytes (red blood cells), instead glutathione was found to be a more likely interacting with PD inside the cell .

Bill May (synchronized swimmer)

Bill May is an American synchronized swimmer. Performing primarily in duets, May won several national and international events. Because of his gender, May was not allowed to compete in the 2004 Summer Olympics.
Early career.
May became interested in synchronized swimming when he was 10 years old while living in upstate New York after watching his sister in a beginning class. He explained why he became involved, "I did competitive swimming there and the synchro class was right after it, so we couldn't go home until she was done. It was either try it with her or sit outside the pool and watch her, so my mom told me to try it, just to be in the water and be doing something."
May began taking lessons and later performed with a local team, the Syracuse Synchro Cats. After the Synchro Cats disbanded, he performed with the Oswego Lakettes.
In 1996, at age 16, May moved to Santa Clara, California. He tried out for the Santa Clara Aquamaids, one of the top synchronized swimming programs in the United States, and was accepted into the junior A squad. May eventually was promoted to the Aquamaid's top "A" squad.
Competition.
Teaming with partner Kristina Lum, May won the duet event at the 1998 US national championships. The pair then won the silver medal in the event at the 1998 Goodwill Games. Because May is male, he was barred from competing in the 1999 Pan American Games.
The International Swimming Federation (FINA) allowed May to compete in its sanctioned events. In 1999, May finished first in duet at the Swiss Open and French Open. He won the Grand Slam at the 2000 Jantzen Nations and was named the US Synchronized Swimming Athlete of the Year in 1998 and 1999.
A hopeful for the 2004 Summer Olympics, May was not allowed to compete after the United States Synchronized Swimming Federation (USSSF) declined to ask for inclusion of a mixed pairs event at the games. Said May, "It was a huge disappointment and it was very humbling. ... It's a political sport in that it's kind of like a clique at school." Replied Ginny Jasontek, President of the USSSF, "We cannot allow men in a women's sport."
Later career.
In 2008, May performed in Cirque du Soleil's water-based show, "O". He was paid $100 for each performance.

Name.
Moše was attested in written sources in 1334 as "Pruk" (and as "Prukk" in 1355, "Mossah" in 1496, and "Mosnach vnder Flednikch" in 1478). The Slovene name is derived from the plural accusative demonym "*Moščane" 'those that live by the bridge' from the Slovene common noun "most" 'bridge' (confirmed by the Bavarian Middle High German name "Pruk(k)", which corresponds to modern German "Brücke" 'bridge'). In the 19th century the German name was "Mosche".
Church.
The church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Michael and was originally a gothic building. It was first mentioned in documents dating to 1526. It is a single-nave structure with an octagonal chancel walled on five side. The church was renovated in 1859, and again in 1884 in a pseudo-Gothic style. Except for the Way of the Cross, which was painted in 1828, the interior of the church and its furnishings are decorated in the pseudo-Gothic style.

Abyssinia (battle honour)

Abyssinia is a battle honour awarded to units of the British Indian Army and the British Army which participated in the 1868 campaign to free Europeans held hostage in Abyssinia (now known as Ethiopia) by Emperor Tewodros II (known at that time to the British as Theodore). The success of the expedition led to the award of this honour to units of the British Indian Army which had participated in the campaign. The units belonged, with the exception of the Madras Sappers, to the Bengal and Bombay Presidency Armies.
The Abyssinian Campaign of 1868.
A diplomatic contretemps by the British Foreign Office led to a rupture of relations between Britain and Ethiopia. The Ethiopian monarch Tewodros had imprisoned a number of Europeans, mostly British and German, including the British Consul, Charles Duncan Cameron, in 1864. A diplomatic mission led by Hormuzd Rassam to gain their freedom, which entered the country in 1866 after numerous delays, met the same fate. In order to obtain their release and punish the offender, an expeditionary force consisting of units from the Bombay and Bengal Armies was despatched from Bombay. The force disembarked on the Red Sea south of Massawa in 1868, traversed 500 kilometres using native labour for road construction, crossed mountain ranges as high as 2,970 metres to storm the Imperial fortress at Magdala to release the prisoners. In the end, only a brief battle was fought against the men who were still loyal to Tewodros, two of the British soldiers wounded in the attack would later die from their injuries, the only other British Forces' deaths were due to disease . The Emperor committed suicide and the force withdrew.
Expeditionary Force.
The Abyssinian expedition of 1868 was led by an engineer officer, Lieutenant General Sir Robert Napier, then Commander-in-Chief, Bombay. The strength of the expeditionary force amounted to 14,000 men comprising four and a half regiments of cavalry, seven batteries and one Indian company of artillery, four battalions of British infantry and ten of Indian infantry.
The Engineers consisted of seven Companies of Sappers and Miners. There were four companies of Bombay Sappers and Miners under Captain (afterwards Major General) AR MacDonnell, namely Numbers 1,2,3 and 4 (that is 17, 18, 19 and 20 Field Companies). The Madras Sapper companies were G, H and K Companies. Also included was the 10th Company of the Royal Engineers.
Military Account.
On 16 September 1867, a reconnoitering party sailed from Bombay. The 3rd and 4th Companies of Bombay Sappers with an advanced brigade from Bombay reached Zula on 21 October and set to work at once to build a pier at the beach. A camp was made about one mile from the sea and 20 wells were erected. The Sappers were also tasked for improving the existing track to Senafe. When the whole force was assembled, they started advancing into the hinterland. The engineering difficulties in reaching Senafe were enormous with high mountains lying ahead.
The Sappers were engaged for six weeks in making a road 10 feet wide, in some places it was carried over enormous granite boulders, by ramps. The force arrived at Senafe on 29 January 1868 and on 26 February, the main body marched from Adigrat and through the good work of a 'Pioneer' force, which included the Bombay Sappers, reached the neighbourhood of Antalo in March. The advance was resumed over increasingly barren and difficult country, where altitudes exceeded 2,900 metres, until at last General Napier arrived at Arogye, a plain at the foot of Magdala on 12 April, where the British could see the way barred, by many thousands of armed Abyssinians camped around the hillsides, with up to 30 artillery pieces.
The Emperor ordered an attack, with many thousands of soldiers armed with little more than spears. The 4th Regiment of Foot quickly redeployed to meet the charging mass of warriors and poured a devastating fire into their ranks. When two Indian infantry regiments contributed their firepower, the onslaught became even more devastating. Despite this, the Abyssinian soldiers continued their attack, losing over 500 with thousands more wounded during the ninety minutes of fighting, most of them at little over 30 yards from the British lines. During the chaotic battle an advance guard unit of the 33rd Regiment overpowered some of the Abyssinian artillerymen and captured their artillery pieces. The surviving Abyssinian soldiers then retreated back onto Magdala.
The following day the advance was resumed with 3,500 men against the stronghold of Magdala which was perched high on a mountain of granite and had only two entry gates. In the assault on 13 April, the Engineers led the way along a path on the side of the precipice towards one of the gates. On reaching the gate there was a pause in the advance as it was discovered the engineer unit had forgotten their powder kegs and scaling ladders and were ordered to return for them. General Staveley was not happy at any further delay and ordered the 33rd Regiment to continue the attack. Several officers and the men of the 33rd, along with an officer from the Royal Engineers, parted from the main force and, after climbing the cliff face, found their way blocked by a thorny hedge over a wall. Private James Bergin, a very tall man, used his bayonet to cut a hole in the hedge and Drummer Michael Magner climbed onto his shoulders through the hedge in the gap and dragged Private Bergin up behind him as Ensign Conner and Corporal Murphy helped shove from below. Bergin kept up a rapid rate of fire on the Koket-Bir as Magnar dragged more men through the gap in the hedge. 
As more men poured through and opened fire, they advanced with their bayonets fixed, the defenders withdrew through the second gate. The party rushed the Koket-bir before it was fully closed and then took the second gate breaking through to the amba. Ensign Wynter scrambled up onto the top of the second gate and fixed the 33rd Regimental Colours to show the plateau had been taken. Private Bergin and Drummer Magner were later awarded the Victoria Cross for their part in the action. 
Tewodros II was found dead inside the second gate, having shot himself with a pistol that had been a gift from Queen Victoria. When his death was announced all resistance ceased. His body was cremated and buried inside the church by the priests. The church was guarded by soldiers from the 33rd Regiment although, according to Henry M. Stanley, looted of "an infinite variety of gold, and silver and brass crosses".
Battle Honour.
The honour was awarded vide Gazette of India No 1181 of 1869. It is not considered repugnant. 
The following Indian units were awarded the battle honour (their present day inheritors are listed after):
Fictional depictions.
The 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia was depicted in a work of historical fiction, Flashman on the March by George MacDonald Fraser. This work was Fraser's last 'Flashman' novel.

Jembaicumbene, New South Wales

Jembaicumbene (pronounced Jemmi-c'm-bene) is a town in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia, located 5 miles (8 km) out along the Braidwood - Majors Creek Road. Once a thriving goldfield, it is now a peaceful, pretty valley on the way to Majors Creek.
Stands of fine old trees mark former home sites and the upturned earth along the length of the Jembaicumbene Creek bears witness to the efforts of many hopeful miners, and the later activities of several dredge mining companies.
Jemaicumbene was the birthplace of Archer, winner of the first two Melbourne Cups in 1861 and 1862. Foaled at the "Exeter Farm", it was also his last home where he was retired to stud, and where he is believed to be buried. Several other Melbourne Cup winners were also bred in the district. Horse racing was the most important leisure activity for the miners in the old days, and the social life for the settlers centred largely around the race meetings, held on courses which have now disappeared.
The other interesting connection between Jembaicumbene and the horse Archer, is that Helen "Ellen" de Mestre, the aboriginal first child of Archer's trainer Etienne de Mestre was born in the area, and some of his Aboriginal grandchildren and great-grandchildren were born there, with one of Etienne's great-grandchildren going on to become an important leader in the Aboriginal community in the South Coast area of New South Wales. This notably is Guboo Ted Thomas (1909–2002), a spiritual leader, and the last initiated tribal elder on the South Coast. Guboo was born under a gum tree at Jembaicumbene.

Gun politics in the Czech Republic

Gun politics in the Czech Republic incorporates the political and regulatory aspects of firearms usage in the country. Policy in the Czech Republic is in many respects less restrictive than elsewhere in Europe "(see Gun politics in the European Union)".
A gun in the Czech Republic is available to anybody with a firearms license. Gun licenses are shall-issue and may be obtained in a way very similar to a driving license. Unlike in most other European countries, the Czech gun legislation also permits a citizen to carry a weapon for self-defense; "concealed" carry is mandatory while open carry is restricted.
The permissive politics have a very long tradition, with the term "pistol" originating in 15th century Czech. The Czech lands have been the manufacturing center (including weapons industry) of Central Europe for over two centuries. Today the Czech Republic is home to arms manufacturers that include Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod and Sellier & Bellot.
History.
The Czech Crown lands witnessed one of the earliest mass use of the firearms, during the Hussite wars in the early 1420s and 1430s. Use of firearms, together with Wagon fort, was one of the key features of Hussite war strategy, which defeated five crusades, launched against the Reformationists' revolt. The word used for one of the guns used by the Hussites, , later found its way through German and French into English as the term pistol. Another gun used by the Hussites, the , gave rise to the English term, "howitzer".
After establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the country took over the existing Austrian gun law of 1852. The law was very liberal, allowing citizens to own and carry guns without any formalities, with restrictions applying only regarding their number. This was restricted during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia: the Nazis forbade private gun ownership (except for hunting) and imposed very harsh punishments. The liberal situation was returned following the defeat of Germany in May 1945.
The situation changed again after the communist coup d'état of 1948. Although the law allowed for some restricted gun ownership, in reality the authorities were instructed which groups of people could be allowed to own a gun. In 1962 a secret directive was adopted, listing the names of persons deemed loyal enough to be allowed to own a gun. A law of 1983 was more liberal, but gun ownership remained relatively restricted. Access to sport guns was easier (sport shooting was encouraged and supported by the state via Svazarm) and the rules for hunting shotgun ownership were relatively permissive.
The new enactment of 1995, after the Velvet Revolution, meant a return to the more liberal times of the First Czechoslovak Republic. Accession to EU required a new law compliant with the European Firearms Regulation, which was passed in 2002. The law remained very liberal despite introducing more regulation.
Current law.
There is no constitutional right to possess firearms in the Czech Republic. According to the Czech Constitutional court, the right to possess firearm is not a basic human right and it may not be derived from the right to own property guaranteed by the Art. 11(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms.
The right to have a gun license issued is provided for in the Act No. 119/2002 Coll. Subject to fulfillment of the act's conditions, anyone is entitled to have the license issued and may then obtain a firearm. Holders of "D" (exercise of profession) and "E" (self-defense) licenses, which are also shall-issue, may also freely carry a concealed firearm.
Categories of guns.
Under the current gun law, guns, ammunition and some accessories are divided into four categories:
A - Restricted firearms and accessories
B - Guns requiring permit
C - Guns requiring registration
D - Guns available to adults above 18
A person must obtain the Gun License (Zbrojní průkaz) to be allowed to own gun of categories A, B and C. To own a gun in the D category only the age of 18 is required. A, B and C category weapon has to be registered within 10 working day with the police after it is bought.
Categories of licences.
There are six categories of gun license; however, these should not be mistaken with the categories for guns.
Obtaining a license.
Person applies for the gun license at the police. If the conditions of age, qualification, health clearance, criminal integrity and personal reliability are met and a fee of 500 CZK per category is paid, the license shall be issued in 30 days. The license must be renewed every ten years (no need to undergo qualification exam if the application is filed at least 2 months before termination of the previous license; health clearance still necessary).
Age.
To obtain a license B, or C, the applicant must be at least 18 years old. Under special circumstances, the applicant need to be only 15 if a member of a sporting club or 16 if taught hunting in schools with such curriculum. To obtain license A, D or E, the applicant must be 21.
Qualification.
Obtaining the license requires passing theoretical and practical exam.
A person can obtain more or all of the categories at once. But the set of categories needs to be known before the exam and highest score needs to be met. Typically, people obtain E and B category because these two categories provides the best versatility (almost any firearm can be owned and carried concealed). The D category is required by the law for the members of the municipal police (members of the state police do not need license) and does not itself permit private gun ownership.
Health clearance.
It is also necessary to present the approval from the applicant's general practitioner that they are physically and mentally fit to own and carry gun. It is fully up to the person's doctor whether he requires them to go through psychological testing. In reality, the psychological test is rarely requested.
Criminal integrity.
The enactment specifies, how long time must run by after a person is released from prison for serving time for particular groups of crimes. Ex-convicts punished for committing selected crimes, such as public endangerment, participation in organized crime group or murder, if sentenced to more than 12 years imprisonment, may never fulfill this condition.
There is a central registry of criminal offenses in the Czech Republic. The criminal integrity is reviewed notwithstanding any possible expungement of the records for other purposes.
Personal reliability.
A person, who verifiably excessively drinks alcohol or uses illegal drugs, as well who was repeatedly found guilty of one of specified misdemeanors in the preceding three years, is considered unreliable for the purposes of issuing a gun license. The police has the right to inquire information regarding these issues also from municipal authorities (misdemeanors are dealt with by municipal authorities and there is no central registry related to them).
Obtaining a license by a foreigner.
The law distinguishes foreigners according to their country of origin. For selected foreigners, a license is shall-issue as same as for Czech citizens, while for others it is a may-issue.
Foreign born residents are treated equally in the eye of Czech law (see above), but proof of a lack of criminal record in their country of origin must be provided; persons having residence also in another EU country must provide documentation showing that they are allowed to own firearm therein. All the documents must be translated into Czech language by a sworn translator. The law on firearm ownership by immigrants is ambiguous, so every police department has slightly different rules.
Foreigners with registered place of residence in the Czech Republic may purchase firearms after obtaining corresponding licenses and permits; persons having residence also in another EU country must provide documentation showing that they are allowed to own such a firearm therein in order to be granted permit to purchase a B category gun.
The written test as well as the practical exam has to be passed in Czech language. In the past a sworn interpreter/translator was allowed, but that possibility no longer exists.
Obtaining firearms.
Each of the A, B, C and E categories of gun license basically allow the person to buy B and C category of gun. Holders of A category of license may, after being granted may-issue exemption by the police, purchase also A category firearm; holders of D category may possess and carry any category of firearm (which remains the property of the employer).
In case of B license the person is allowed to use their guns at the shooting ranges. The C license is required by other laws for hunting. The E license allows the person to own a gun for self-defense purpose and carry the concealed weapon. All guns need to be registered with the police in 10 working days after buying except for the D category.
There is no limit in the law on number of owned guns. The law specifies safe storage requirements for those owning more than two weapons or more than 500 rounds of ammunition. The safe storage requirements are further exacerbated for those owning more than 10 and more than 20 firearms.
Possession of an firearm without gun license (as well as sale, manufacturing, procurment, etc.) is a criminal offense which carries penalty of up to two year imprisonment (up to eight years in defined cases).
Shooting ranges.
Firearm owners are allowed to practice only at licensed shooting ranges and may otherwise use the firearm only in case of self-defense, or when permitted by other laws (e.g. hunting). As of 2014, there are almost two hundred places opened for the public. Any adult can visit such a range and shoot from available weapons, without restrictions or permits. A person without a gun license has to be supervised (if younger than 18, then by a person at least 21 years old who has been a holder of a gun license for at least 3 years).
Carrying a firearm.
Holders of different categories of firearms licenses have different possibility of carrying their firearms. In general, it is prohibited to carry firearms to court buildings, at demonstrations or mass meetings. It is also generally considered irresponsible to take guns to clubs or bars even though it is not explicitly prohibited by law. Carrying a gun while drunk is however illegal and can lead to heavy fines and losing the gun license.
Carrying guns in schools and campuses is not prohibited by law and there are no so called "gun-free zones".
No carry.
Holders of "A" license (collection purposes) may only obtain and possess firearms (also those falling into the "A" - restricted guns category, subject to being granted a may-issue permit) and are "not" allowed to carry them.
Transport only.
Holders of "B" (sport shooting) license may only transport their firearms to and from the areas designated for sport shooting. The firearms must be transported in a closed container and in a manner that excludes their immediate use.
Holders of "C" (hunting) license may too transport their firearms only to and from the areas designated for hunting in a manner that excludes their immediate use. In case that they use public transportation, the firearm must also be transported in a closed container.
Concealed carry.
Holders of category "D" (exercise of profession) and "E" (self-defense) license may carry up to two firearms ready for immediate use (bullet-in-chamber). The firearms must be carried in concealed manner.
The requirement of concealed carry applies also for "D" holders of restricted firearms (e.g. private security with fully automatic firearms).
The Czech Republic is relatively safe country (Prague, having the highest criminal rate in the country still rates as one of the safest capitals in the European Union). Considering the number of the E category licenses there are about 200 000 people who could potentially carry a firearm, however it is not clear how many of them regularly do so.
Open carry.
Only the members of Municipal Police and of the Czech National Bank's security, as holders of "D" (exercise of profession) license, may carry their firearms openly while on duty.
Members of state police, prison service and other governmental security agencies do not need any gun license and are permitted/required by other laws to open or concealed carry while on duty.
Ammunition restrictions.
All of the high penetrating (armor piercing) and hollow point ammunition is classified as category A (see above). The alternative to a hollow point ammunition was Federal EFMJ, which has been classified into the arms group A in mid 2009, effectively outlawing it. Therefore only Full metal jacket or soft nosed semi jacketed rounds and or just unjacketed bullets (lead only) are allowed. Generally, no ammunition with higher wounding potential is allowed.
There is currently no restriction on caliber size and no restriction on magazine capacity, however special safe storage requirements apply for those having more than 500, 10.000 and 20.000 bullets.
Self defense with firearms.
There are no specific legal provisions covering self-defense by a civilian using a firearm. The general provision regarding criminal aspects of self-defense are contained in the Section 29 ("Necessary self defense") of the Criminal Code. General provisions regarding civil liability in respect of self-defense are contained in the Section 14 of the Civil Code.
In general, Czech penal theory recognizes certain classes of circumstances where criminal & civil liability will be excluded in respect of actions which would normally attract a criminal penalty. These include "utmost necessity", "necessary self defense" and other cases involving "eligible use of a gun".
Utmost necessity.
Utmost necessity may be invoked where an interest protected by the Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) is endangered. An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only if there is no other way of avoiding it ("subsidiarity"), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act ("proportionality").
Necessity is excluded in cases where:
Necessary self defense.
The basis of necessary self-defense is deflection of an "imminent" or "ongoing" attack against an interest covered by the Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) by performing an action which would otherwise be punishable (such as use of a firearm against the other person). The imminent part means that a party is evidently and immediately threatened, it is not necessary to wait for the attacker to start the attack, especially if he is known for his aggressiveness. (That, however, is not the case if the attack is being prepared, but not imminent). The necessary self-defense may also be enacted when defending someone else's interest (i.e. defending their person or their property) as long as the same requirements are met. However, defending against a provoked attack is not considered "necessary self defense".
There is no requirement of subsidiarity: in this respect "necessary self defense" differs from "utmost necessity". The main limitation is that the defense may not be manifestly disproportionate to the "manner of the attack". The manner of the attack is not the same as its intensity, which is only a part of it. For example, "intensity" covers whether the attack is committed by a single attacker or a group, with or without a gun, and the relative strength of the attacker and the party attacked, etc. But the manner also includes future imminent dangers, such as the possibility that single attacker might imminently be joined by others.
As regards proportionality, the law states that a self-defense may not be "manifestly disproportionate". It is evident, that for a self-defense to be successful, it has to be performed on a level exceeding the attack. Unlike in case of necessity, the consequence of necessary self-defense may be more serious than consequence of the attack. The defense may not be restricted to a passive one, it can also be active. It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at its beginning which determines who is to be deemed the attacker, and who is the party attacked.
There are two main excesses, which are not recognized as necessary self-defense:
Eligible use of a gun.
Eligible use of a gun is addressed in special enactments dealing with police, secret security service, prison guards etc. Thus for example a policeman may, under specified conditions, shoot on an escaping suspect, a privilege which an armed civilian does not have.
General tendencies.
It is acceptable to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially when a person is attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. The defense is judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender during the time of the imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.
The American style Castle Doctrine is also not applied however it is usually considered acceptable to defend from a "violent" home invasion with a firearm. In 2014, an amendment of laws concerning self-defense was proposed with the aim of giving greater leeway to defenders, especially in cases when they would not normally meet the bar for legitimate self-defense under the current legislation, but face extraordinary circumstances, such as confusion as a consequence of the attack, or when facing home invasion.
Although there is no stand-your-ground law, the fact that necessary defense (unlike utmost necessity) is not subject to subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker does not mean that the defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death and, according to courts, it may not be expected from a defender to wait and rely on chance that a damage which is, both objectively and in the defender's subjective understanding, threatened to happen, will not take place. The defender may use "proportionate" accessible means in order to prevent an imminent attack and disarm the attacker.
Popularity of guns.
Despite the relatively liberal gun laws, guns are not especially popular in the Czech Republic; nevertheless sport shooting is the third most widespread sport after football and hockey. In 2013, there were 306,815 licenses and 728,476 registered firearms (for the 10,5 million population). In the long term number of licences slightly decreases while number of registered guns keeps growing.
The Czech Republic is home to many firearms manufacturers including Česká Zbrojovka. The famous models of handguns such as CZ 75 are very popular among Czechs. Czechs also favour various types of Glocks and 1911 clones. Long arms by Czech manufacturers are also very popular especially among Czech competition shooters or hunters. There are relatively fewer revolvers, mostly from US manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson and Colt, or Czech producers ALFA and Kora (revolver).
Incidents and gun crimes.
In 2005, there were 5.317 misdemeanors and 924 criminal offenses committed with firearms compared to 5428 misdemeanors and 836 criminal acts in 2007.
It is generally not common for licensed gun owners to commit violent crimes with their guns, and most of the gun crimes are committed with illegal weapons that are beyond the control of the law. The number of murders committed with legally owned guns reached its peak in 2000, when 20 people were murdered. There were 16 murders committed with legally owned guns in 2003, 17 in 2007 and 2 in 2010. The majority of them are committed during family quarrels, with only a minimum being premeditated.
Occasionally crimes with legally owned guns do happen. The most notable examples include: 
General attitudes to guns and efforts to tighten the law.
The gun law in the Czech Republic is quite liberal. It is mostly caused by the fact that after the fall of communist regime people wanted to regain their rights to keep and bear arms and these needs resulted in passing quite a liberal legislation in 1996, which surpassed the previous restrictive communist enactment. The law became widely accepted and led to quite massive civilian arming. Especially many businessmen felt the actual need to obtain a firearm because the times shortly after the Velvet Revolution are known for the rise in organized crime often related to the economic transformation in the early 1990s.
Today fewer people feel the need to carry a firearm for protection. General attitude to gun ownership is that there is no point in banning guns because criminals will get guns no matter how tight the law is. Also the fact that Czech Republic has a strong tradition in firearms manufacturing and competition shooting contributes to generally moderate attitude to gun control.
A sharp increase in gun ownership took place in 2011 after a number of attacks of Romani perpetrators against victims from majority population, some of which were racially motivated. This arming was taking place especially in regions such as Šluknov Hook, where high crime rates are often attributed to people from Roma minority, and where majority population distrust police and authorities. This local trend however didn't influence long term statistics.
Efforts to tighten the law usually arise after deadly incidents like those described above. Obligatory psychological testing for gun owners is the most common subject of the discussion however has always been rejected. Gun advocates point out that it is not clear what the tests would be like and who would be responsible for the testing and its results. It is also pointed out that it is unlikely that any psychological testing would reveal a potentially dangerous individual because some famous killers in the past were members of the military or the law enforcement and passed very difficult psychological testing successfully.
The law was last tightened in 2008 introducing for example stricter sanctions for carrying gun while intoxicated. Proposals to introduce mandatory psychological testing were not passed. The efforts to tighten gun legislation are also unlikely to pass as about a fifth of members of the Czech Parliament are holders of firearm license; some of them are believed to carry firearms also within the parliament grounds (parliamentarians are not required to pass gun check on entry unlike other staff or visitors).
Other type of weapons.
There is currently no regulation on other type of weapons such as knives, pepper sprays, batons or electrical paralyzers. These weapons can be freely bought and carried in concealed manner by anybody above 18. Similarly as in the case of firearms, it is prohibited to carry these weapons to court buildings, demonstrations and mass meetings.
Carrying non-lethal weapons such as pepper sprays, paralyzers or gas pistols is officially recommended by the Ministry of Interior as prevention in case of assault.

Hayedeh Legendary Persian Diva

Hayedeh Legendary Persian Diva (Persian: سخن از هایده / "Sokhan az Hayedeh") is a 2009 documentary film about the late Iranian iconic singer Hayedeh, made by the exiled musician and journalist Pejman Akbarzadeh in The Netherlands.
The 100-minute documentary was filmed in France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. The language of the film is Persian.
Hayedeh documentary was released on 20 January 2010, the 20th death anniversary of Hayedeh. The DVD was released by "Persian Dutch Network" in Amsterdam.
Content.
"Hayedeh Legendary Persian Diva" contains an extensive review of the singers's artistic activities beginning in the late 1960s at Radio Tehran and ending in 1990 in California.
"Hayedeh Legendary Persian Diva" looks at Hayedeh's career against the backdrop of political and social upheaval in Persia as the nation went from monarchy to revolution to protracted war that forced many of its best and brightest into exile. In one of the first frames of the documentary, the director writes:
""Since the 1979 revolution in Persia (Iran), which brought a fundamentalist religious government to power, women have not been allowed to sing in public. All Persian women singers were forced to end their careers and many of them moved abroad to sing. Hayedeh (1942-1990) was one of those who fled Iran"."
"Hayedeh Legendary Persian Diva" includes rare videos, audio clips, photos, and original interviews with the main figures of her career: the songwriters Andranik, Mohammad Heydari, Anooshirvan Rohani, Farid Zoland, Sadegh Nojouki, producer Manouchehr Bibiyan, conductor Farnoush Behzad, music critic Mahmoud Khoshnam, tar soloist Parviz Rahman-Panah, and the last Persian queen Farah Pahlavi.
The documentary has been dedicated to the memory of Amir Zamanifar, a close friend of Pejman Akbarzadeh and Radio Farda's correspondent in Prague who was killed in a car crash in 2009.
Reception.
"Hayedeh, Legendary Persian Diva" for the first time was screened on January 24, 2009 at Griffioen Cultural Center, associated to Amsterdam Vrije Universiteit. The event was organized on the occasion of 19th Anniversary of Hayedeh's death in exile. Holland's Persian community and US-/Europe-based Persian-language media warmly received the event. Before the screening, Voice of America's Persian TV, BBC Persian Radio, Radio Farda, etc. interviewed the director and broadcast the trailer.
In April 2009 the documentary was screened in an event organized by Rahaward Cultural Center in Aachen. In the German city some leftist Persian immigrants boycotted the event. Deutsche Welle correspondent wrote: "About 25 people were present for viewing the film, which was a source of bewilderment and disenchantment of the filmmaker and organizers of the event."
"Hayedeh, Legendary Persian Diva" had its sold-out US premiere at the 3rd Noor Film Festival in Los Angeles on May 1, 2009. After the screening, Persian-American Hollywood director Reza Badiyi, in an interview with Homa Sarshar on Radio 670 KIRN, described itt as a "Chapter on the beauties of Hayedeh life". The documentary was also nominated as the "best documentary" at Noor Film Festival but according to BBC Persian TV's Aslan Hafezi: "Presentation of unveiled information in the film caused the objections of some of Hayedeh’s relations and fans."
"Hayedeh, Legendary Persian Diva" was also screened at the 9th International Exile Film Festival in Gothenburg, Sweden in October 2009. Following the sold-out screening at Hagabion Hall and in a review for BBC Persian website, Hooman Khalatbari, a Graz-based opera conductor, wrote: ""this is the first Persian documentary which covers all aspects of a singer's career and almost all important figures in the singer's artistic activity are present there"". The opera conductor also wrote: ""I believe Hayedeh's work will remain as a cultural memento for the next Persian generations"".." 
"Hayedeh, Legendary Persian Diva" was also screened in December 2009 at the 4th Iranian Film Festival in Zaandam, Holland. 
The documentary was screened at the 8th International Festival of Iranian Cinema in Exile in Paris in April 2010 and will also be presented at the Iranian Festival in Seattle in June 2010. 
In May 2010 the leftist Israeli newspaper Haaretz published a comprehensive article about the film by Noam Ben-Zeev, a professor at University of Haifa. Ben-Zeev cited the documentary as a film which shows the "Rise and Fall of Hayedeh". 
In July 2013, "Holland Times" wrote about the film: "Through a mixture of original footage dating back as far as the 1960s as well as contemporary interviews, the viewer is given great insight into the musical make up of Persia at the time..." 
Reaction from Iran's Governmental Media.
In September 2009 the semi-official Fars News Agency in Tehran criticized Pejman Akbarzadeh for making a film about the "corrupt monarchist singer, Hayedeh".
