United States v. Willow River Power Co.

United States v. Willow River Power Co., is a 1945 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court involving the question whether the United States was liable under the Fifth Amendment for a “taking” of private property for a public purpose when it built a dam on navigable waters that raised the water level upstream to lessen the head of water at a power company’s dam, thereby decreasing the production of power by the company’s hydroelectric turbines. The Court’s opinion is notable because it asks the question whether the courts will provide a remedy because a property right has been invaded or a property right exists because the courts will enforce it. This is a reformulation of the Euthyphro dilemma found in Plato's dialogue "Euthyphro".
Factual background.
The Mississippi River, a navigable stream, is joined by the St. Croix River, another navigable stream, slightly above Red Wing, Minnesota. Farther up the St. Croix, the Willow River, a non-navigable stream, flowed into the St. Croix, but some years ago a dam was built blocking off the former mouth of the Willow. A channel was dug above that dam, connecting the Willow to the St. Croix, and the channel was also dammed. A mill was built to exploit the head of water created by the two dams. Subsequently, the Willow River Power Company acquired the land adjacent to these dams and it built a hydroelectric facility near them. The spillway or tailrace below the power’s company’s turbines exited into the St. Croix River. (See map.)
The United States then built the Red Wing Dam on the Mississippi River. The dam raised the water level of the Mississippi above Red Wing and also that of the St. Croix. The effect was to decrease the available head of water at the hydroelectric plant by three feet, decreasing the power output from the turbines and requiring the power company to purchase electric power from other sources. The economic loss to the power company was $25,000. The power company sued the United States for a taking and was awarded $25,000. The United States appealed to the Supreme Court.
Decision of Supreme Court.
Majority opinion.
The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Jackson, reversed. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires just compensation when private property is taken for public use. It thus “undertakes to redistribute certain economic losses inflicted by public improvements so that they will fall upon the public, rather than wholly upon those who happen to lie in the path of the project.” The Fifth Amendment does not, however, “socialize all losses, but those only which result from a taking of property.” Other damages that result from government conduct are absorbed by the public, if at all, only when Congress passes a law providing for compensation. In this case, no such law exists, so that unless this case represents an instance of a “taking” of “property,” the power company is without redress for its $25,000 loss.
The Court then stated the issue before it, in terms similar to those of the Euthyphro dilemma:
ot all economic interests are "property rights;" only those economic advantages are "rights" which have the law back of them, and only when they are so recognized may courts compel others to forbear from interfering with them or to compensate for their invasion. The law long has recognized that the right of ownership in land may carry with it a legal right to enjoy some benefits from adjacent waters. But that a closed catalogue of abstract and absolute "property rights" in water hovers over a given piece of shore land good against all the world is not, in this day, a permissible assumption. We cannot start the process of decision by calling such a claim as we have here a "property right;" whether it is a property right is really the question to be answered. Such economic uses are rights only when they are legally protected interests. 
After considering precedents governing rights to a head of water when the tailrace was in a navigable stream or a non-navigable stream, the Court concluded that no prior case had dealt with precisely the situation (present here) where the top of the tailrace was at a non-navigable stream and its base was at a navigable stream. Accordingly, there was no recognized legal right to have water flow away from a tailrace into a navigable stream. The Court therefore ruled:
We hold that claimant's interest or advantage in the high water level of the St. Croix River as a run-off for tail waters to maintain its power head is not a right protected by law, and that the award below based exclusively on the loss in value thereof must be reversed.
Dissent.
Justice Roberts (joined by the Chief Justice) dissented on the ground that state law recognized a property interest in having a head of water undisturbed.
Comparison of majority and dissenting opinions.
It appears that the Court (majority) resolved its version of the Euthyphro dilemma by ruling that property rights exist if courts recognize and protect them, rather than holding that property rights pre-exist and courts merely perceive them. The dissenters, however, considered that property rights existed "a priori" and dictated the conclusion that courts should (therefore) enforce them.

Typhoon Prapiroon (2006)

Typhoon Prapiroon (international designation: 0606, JTWC designation: 07W, PAGASA name: Henry) was a minimal typhoon which caused deadly flooding in southern China. Prapiroon developed out of a persistent area of convection accompanied by an area of low pressure on July 25 about 120 km (75 mi) west-southwest of Yap. Two days later, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and PAGASA classified the system as a tropical depression, with PAGASA giving it the local name 'Henry'. By July 31, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 07W. A strong subtropical ridge located to the north of the depression led to a west-northwest movement for most of the storm existence.
A few hours after the JTWC began issuing advisories, the depression made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines. The next day, after crossing into the South China Sea, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and named Prapiroon. Several hours later, PAGASA issued their final advisory on the storm as it moved out of their area of responsibility. By the morning of August 2, Prapiroon intensified into a typhoon and reached its peak intensity with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph 10-min). The typhoon maintained this intensity until shortly before landfall near Shangyang, China at 12:00 UTC on August 3, where it weakened to a severe tropical storm. Prapiroon quickly weakened and dissipated early on August 5.
Severe flooding in the Philippines and China from Prapiroon killed 94 people and left 10 others missing. Over 20 million people were affected by the storm in China alone. Significant flight delays and cancellations in Hong Kong led to $1.9 million in compensation pay to travelers. About 30,000 homes collapsed and 140,000 others were damaged by the storm. Damages were estimated at $640,000 (2006 USD) in the Philippines and $984 million (2006 USD) in China. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement sought $4,825,791 (2006 USD) in funds for victims of the typhoon.
Meteorological history.
On July 25, an area of convection persisted about 120 km (75 mi) west-southwest of Yap. Satellite imagery indicated that a low level circulation had developed and was under an area of light to moderate wind shear. The low traveled in a general northwest fashion as upper level outflow improved. By July 27, the low deteriorated, becoming elongated, and convection remained disorganized. However, as the low neared Central Luzon, Philippines, shower and thunderstorm activity near the center of the low increased, and based on its organization, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system a tropical depression early that morning. Shortly after, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the system as Tropical Depression Henry. As the depression neared the northern Philippines, wind shear increased, partially exposing the center of the system to the south. At 02:30 UTC on June 30, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and at 00:00 UTC the next morning, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 07W.
Upon first becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression tracked towards the west-northwest due to a strong subtropical ridge located to the north of the system. A few hours later, the system made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines with winds of 55 km/h (35 mph 1-minute winds). After being over land for most of July 31, the depression relocated into the South China Sea and the JTWC determined that it intensified into a tropical storm. At around 06:00 UTC, the JMA designated the storm Tropical Storm Prapiroon about 300 km (185 mi) northwest of Dagupan City, Philippines, a few hours later, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Tropical Storm Henry (Prapiroon) as it moved out of their area of responsibility. Prapiroon gradually intensified as it moved towards the west-northwest at 24 km/h (15 mph), and by that afternoon, the system had completely moved into the South China Sea. By the nighttime hours, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a severe tropical storm, as they determined that the maximum sustained winds had reached 95 km/h (60 mph 10-minute winds). By the morning of August 2, the JTWC upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon, and a few hours later, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon.
Heading towards the northwest, Prapiroon reached its peak intensity early on August 3. The JMA estimated that Prapiroon peaked with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg), while the JTWC estimated that the storm peaked with winds of 130 km/h (80 mph 1-minute winds). Prapiroon maintained this intensity for 12 hours before weakening slightly as it made landfall near Shangyang at 12:00 UTC. At the time of landfall, the JMA downgraded Prapiroon to a severe tropical storm, with winds of 110 km/h (70 mph 10-minute winds) while the JTWC analyzed Prapiroon to have had winds of 120 km/h (75 mph 1-minute winds). Due to the interaction with land, the storm quickly weakened. Early on August 5, both agencies issued their final advisories on Prapiroon as it dissipated over central Guangxi.
Preparations.
Philippines.
As Tropical Depression 07W, locally named 'Henry' by PAGASA, neared the provence the northern Philippines, a total of 17 provinces were placed under a storm alert as winds of 30 kts (55 km/h) were likely to affect areas near the depression. Residents in the northern Philippines were advised to avoid low-lying areas and be alert for flooding. About 15,000 people were evacuated following heavy rains from the outer bands of the storm.
China.
The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and Macau's Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau both hoisted strong wind signal 1 on August 1 as the system was located within 800 km (497 mi) of their respective cities. As Prapiroon neared the southern coast of China, the signal was raised to strong wind signal 3 as strong winds were expected to strike the area. This was further increased to strong wind signal 8 SE on August 3, as gale-force winds were expected in the southeastern areas. All signals were cancelled the next afternoon as Prapiroon moved inland.
In advance of Prapiroon, government officials in Guangdong Provence, China sent out 11 million mobile text messages to alert people of the approaching storm. About 843,000 people were evacuated ahead of the storm, 335,000 in Guangdong, 382,000 in Guangxi, and 126,000 in Hainan. Officials ordered 62,023 ships to return to port to prevent them from being stranded at sea. Kindergarten and special schools in Hong Kong were suspended for at least two days for the day of and following the storms landfall.
Impact.
In the wake of Prapiroon, severe flooding left 94 people dead and 10 others missing. Damages from the storm were estimated at $984.8 million (2006 USD; $1.1 billion 2008 USD). Throughout southern China, Prapiroon affected over 20 million people.
Philippines.
As a tropical depression, Prapiroon caused heavy rains over the northern Philippines, leaving six people dead. In Candaba, a two-year-old boy, identified as Elmer Celso, drowned in floodwaters outside his home. Five other fatalities were reported due to flooding. Two other people were listed as missing. Agricultural damage was estimated at $640,000 (2006 USD).
China.
Despite weakening to a severe tropical storm before landfall, Prapiroon brought torrential rains and flooding which left 88 people dead and eight others missing. About 10 million people were affected by the typhoon, while 30,000 homes collapsed and 140,000 others were damaged. Damages from the typhoon were estimated at $984 million (2006 USD; $1.1 billion 2008 USD). Guangdong Province was the hardest hit of the three provinces affected by Typhoon Prapiroon. About 3.72 million people were affected by the storm and 7,000 homes were destroyed in the province. A tornado struck Foshan, Shanwei and Shaoguan, killing nine. A police officer was killed when a landslide buried him during a rescue in Sihui. Another hard hit province, Guangxi, was struck by Prapiroon. About 5.1 million people were affected by the storm and 219,441 were displaced. Ten people were killed by a flash flood and landslide in Laibin and Hengxian. Another flash flood swept away a shelter which thirteen migrant workers resided in, all of whom were confirmed to have been killed. Three more people were killed when a landslide caused their home to collapse in Luming Village. About 9,300 homes and 195,900 hectares of farmland were destroyed.
Hong Kong.
As Prapiroon neared Hong Kong, thousands of people were stranded in airports as hundreds of flights in and out of the area were cancelled. Twenty cargo containers in the harbor were tipped over and one person was injured by the falling containers. A total of 381 flights were cancelled and 725 were delayed, affecting about 10 million people. Compensation costs from the travel delays amounted to $1.9 million (2006 USD). According to airport authorities, the storm caused the worst disruption in the airport's 20 year history. Winds were recorded up to 103 km/h (63 mph) in the harbor. The highest gust was recorded on Green Island at 193 km/h (119 mph). Seven people were injured by objects blown around by the wind. A cargo vessel, with a crew of 23, ran aground near the harbor. No injuries were reported from the incident. Two other incidents with vessels occurred near Ma Wan and Tuen Mun. Seven hundred trees were blown down and another 1,600 sustained damage. Maximum rainfall from Prapiroon was estimated at 8.1 in (207.5 mm). Two landslides were also reported and about 200 hectares of farmland was damaged. A storm surge of 2.71 m (8.89 ft) was recorded.
Aftermath.
After Prapiroon dissipated, the regional Disease Prevention and Control Center of Guangxi Autonomous Region sent out eight teams of health workers to help avoid epidemics in affected areas. Despite the damage in the wake of the typhoon, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs did not activate any emergency response plans. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement sought for $4,825,791 (2006 USD) in funds to assist 240,000 people who were affected over a 12 month span. Reconstruction in the areas devastated by Prapiroon began shortly after the typhoon dissipated.
Naming.
The name Prapiroon was one of the ten original names submitted by Thailand to the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee for use from January 1, 2000. "Prapiroon" refers to the Taiwanese Rain God and was last used during the 2000 Pacific typhoon season. Despite the large loss of life and severe damage associated with the storm, the name was not retired at the end of the year and remains of the list of names for the western Pacific basin.
The PAGASA assigned the local name of Henry to Prapiroon. This was the first use of the name "Henry" for a tropical depression in the Philippines area of responsibility. It replaced the name "Hambalos" which was retired after the 2002 Pacific typhoon season due to the loss of life in the Philippines. The name Henry was not retired at the end of the season and is set to be reused in the 2010 Pacific typhoon season.

Australia.
In the Australian Army the main reconnaissance vehicle is the ASLAV, which is the Australian version of the LAV 25. The Army Reserve regiments use the Light Cavalry Patrol Vehicle, aka the Regional Force Surveillance Vehicle, which is a variant of the Land Rover Perentie.

The Kenya Defense Forces have one armoured reconnaissance battalion.
Canada.
In the Canadian Army, each Regular Force armoured regiment maintains both tank and reconnaissance (recce) capacities. While Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) is a tank-heavy regiment, both the Royal Canadian Dragoons and the 12e Régiment blindé du Canada are recce-heavy regiments. 
All armoured regiments in the Reserve Force are roled as armoured recce.

Denmark.
There is only one armoured recce battalion in the Danish army.
Disband 
Germany.
In 2005 the reconnaissance units of the German Army were restructured. The former "Panzeraufklärungstruppe" ("armored reconnaissance corps"), "Fernspähtruppe " ("long range reconnaissance corps"), "Feldnachrichtentruppe" and UAV units of the "Artillerietruppe" ("artillery corps") haven been combined to the new "Heeresaufklärungstruppe" ("army reconnaissance corps").
Now the German Army is operating five reconnaissance battalions and five independent companies:
Reconnaissance Bataillons:
Reserve units:
Every Battalion (except the Aufklärungslehrbataillon 3) is structured in four companies:
1. HQ & Support Company
2. Armoured Reconnaissance Company
3. Light Reconnaissance Company
4. UAV Company
Netherlands.
The Dutch Army has one regiment, the "Regiment Huzaren van Boreel" which was named after Willem Francois Boreel. The Regiment consists of 4 squadrons: 2 squadrons belong to the ISTAR battalion and the other 2 each belonging to 1 of the 2 Netherlands Mechanised Brigades. 
The difference in organisation between the ISTAR squadrons and the brigade squadrons is that the ISTAR squadrons each have a Tactical Air Control Party for Close Air Support and the 2 brigade squadrons each have an anti-tank platoon which operate with Fennek vehicles with Gill anti-tank weapons. All squadrons are trained to operate completely independently. They have their own logistical support and all patrols have special forces medics for emergencies. The training and operation procedures of all squadrons are very similar although the ISTAR squadrons focus more on long range reconnaissance operations. Recently all squadrons have been on combat operations in the south of Afghanistan.
New Zealand.
The New Zealand Army only has one squadron that performs armoured reconnaissance. This is also the only reserve armoured squadron.
Norway.
The Norwegian Army has two armoured reconnaissance squadrons.
Sri Lanka.
The Sri Lanka Army has five recce regiments attached to the Sri Lanka Armoured Corps.
South Africa.
There is only one armoured recce regiment in the South African Army, and it is designated an armoured car reconnaissance regiment.
United Kingdom.
In the British Army armoured reconnaissance units carry out "formation reconnaissance" for higher level formations. In the British Army these Formation reconnaissance regiments are usually providing reconnaissance for a division or a heavy brigade. In a large-scale defensive operation, they would delay attacking forces, whilst screening heavier units as they moved to engage the enemy. The regiments are, currently, almost entirely equipped with vehicles of the Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) - CVR(T) - family. Some of the armoured regiments of the British Army are known as formation reconnaissance instead of armoured. 
Formation reconnaissance regiments in the British Army
United States.
Each brigade combat team (BCT) (there are multiple combat support and combat service support brigades that may or may not have such assets) in the Army has an organic reconnaissance squadron assigned to it. Each heavy brigade combat team has an armed reconnaissance squadron consisting of three reconnaissance troops and an unmanned aerial vehicle troop. The reconnaissance troops have two reconnaissance platoons with five M1114 HMMWVs and three M3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicles (a variant of the M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle). Stryker BCTs include a Stryker-vehicle-based reconnaissance squadron. There are more than 30 cavalry reconnaissance squadrons in the US Army.

Philpstoun railway station

Philpstoun railway station was a railway station in the village of Philpstoun, to the east of Linlithgow in West Lothian, Scotland. It was located on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway.
History.
Philpstoun station was opened by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway on 21 February 1842. It was closed on 18 June 1951 by British Railways.
The area around Philpstoun, in common with others in West Lothian, was an extremeley busy centre for shale mining and petroleum manufacturing for almost a century, and this was reflected in the railways around Philpstoun. The station itself was situated in a deep cutting, and had two platforms. Immediately to the west, a facing junction, with crossovers and a looping facilities connected to a set of exchange sidings at Westfield, and these ran into Philpstoun No 1 shale mine. Extensive sidings connected within the facility, and a short branch ran just west of the (still extant) shale bings, crossing the canal, and continuing past Easter Pardovan in a southerly direction to serve a shale pit at Ochiltree (just north west of Threemiletown). A tramway ran in the same direction on the eastern flank of the bings.
A trailing siding left the main up line near Pardovan, this was known as Pardovan siding and originally served a quarry.
Further west, a line branched from the down main via a trailing junction and ran adjacent to the mainline for some 500 yards before swinging south west, passing Champfleurie, before swinging south to serve oil works and a shale mine between Bridgend and Wester Ochiltree.

Finavarra Tower

Finavarra Tower is a Martello tower in Finavarra, County Clare, Ireland. Built during the Napoleonic wars in 1812-16, and situated on Finavarra Point, the tower protected the north-eastern side of Ballyvaughan Bay and the south-western entrance of New Quay harbour from possible attack from France.
British military engineers built many such fortifications as signal towers to protect the coast against a French invasion. Most of these towers are oval or round and stand between forty and sixty feet high. Their staircases were incorporated within the walls and the doorway was usually some distance above ground level. This ovoid tower had three gun placements on the roof. The usual garrison of these towers was about ten men who would have lived in a nearby barracks. The remains of such a barracks lie north-east of the tower. However, nearby Aughinish Tower which is thought to have been of similar and contemporaneous construction, included quarters for around 40 men.
At the site of Finavarra Tower, a small stone has the following: "This property including the Martello Tower and Appurtemances was bequeathed to the State for the benefit of the Nation by MRS. MAUREEN EMERSON who died on the 4th day of November 1999."

The theme for this season's house was Heaven and Hell. Andy, Beni, Cathy, Daniel, Geraldine, and Madeleine entered on launch night with 24 other housemates entering throughout the season. 
Big Brother Reloaded (since 12 January 2009)
From Day 36 on, the concept of this series was changed due to bad ratings. There was one main living area, "Heaven", where all housemates lived. "Hell" was only used as living area for punished or nominated housemates. Because of the structural changes of the interior, alteration that were done on Day 34 and 35 forced the housemates to live in the 2 rooms used for matches. On Day 43, 3 former housemates re-entered the house, Sascha Sirtl (Season 5 winner), Andreas "Knubbel" Büttgenbach (Season 7 housemate (5th place in season 7)), and Marcel Schiefelbein (Season 8 runner-up). They were eligible to win the 250,000 € prize.
Housemates.
Entered on Day 1:
Intruders:
Nominations table.
Notes:
<br>Only the housemates on the hell side of the house could be nominated. As new housemates, Eisi and Jana were immune from getting nominated. The audience saved Beni from being up for eviction.
<br>There were two separate evictions on day 29, one for the housemates who entered in the first 8 days, which was decided by a housemate vote. Delia had the most votes but was saved by the audience, resulting in Eisi's eviction (because he had the second highest amount of votes). The other eviction was for Desi and Oliver, who entered the house on Christmas Eve, which should have been decided by the heavenly housemates, but the initial vote resulted in a tie. Therefore the public had to evict one of them. 
<br>Eisi, who was evicted in the last eviction, had to choose one person to nominate two people for eviction as "revenge" for his eviction. He chose Daniel.
<br>Delia, who was evicted on Day 36, had to choose three housemates to be automatically up for eviction.She chose Daniel, Cathy, and Sascha. 
<br>The 7 housemates not nominated for eviction in round four had to choose one housemate who they wanted to be evicted. Beni and Oliver both received 2 votes so the public had to decide between the two of them who they wanted to evict.
<br>All housemates have to nominate as normal. The 3 or more housemates with the most votes are up for eviction. The public could choose one housemate to be immune for eviction. They chose Sascha S. Sascha S. had to choose one of the housemates, who received 1 nomination vote, to replace him. He chose Annina. Andy came up for eviction due to persistent rule breaking.
<br>All housemates have to nominate as normal. Beni, Daniel, Knubbel, Sascha, and Sascha S. were drilled by a drill instructor. The drill instructor decides who gets nominated because of a weak performance. He chose Sascha.
<br>Housemates were asked which housemates should live in Hell for the following week. What they didn't know was that all housemates living in Hell would be immune from eviction. Beni, Daniel, Jana, and Madeleine volunteered and therefore were immune from eviction. There was a surprise double eviction.
<br>Housemates nominated one person. Geraldine was given immunity from eviction by a public vote.
<br>This time housemates nominate to save. The 4 housemates with the least votes are up for eviction. As Bettie is a new housemate, she was immune from eviction.
<br>Housemates will nominate face to face. The 4 housemates with the most votes are up for eviction. As Claudine, Claudy, and Patricia are new housemates, they are immune from eviction. As they were only 3 housemates nominated, the public could nominate one housemate directly. They chose Geraldine. Before this vote, Sascha S. was saved from the public. Bettie left the house shortly after the nominations, housemates had to vote who should be the fourth housemate nominated. The second round of nominations is displayed in the bottom row. As Annina, Marcel, and Orhan received 3 votes each, Sascha S. had to decide which housemates should be up for eviction. He chose Annina.
<br>Housemates have to nominate 2 people for eviction. Sascha S. received immunity as he won a karaoke competition last week. As Claudine and Sascha received 2 nominations each, the public has to decide who of the both should be up for eviction. They chose Claudine.
<br>Only the most popular female, Geraldine, and male housemate, Sascha S., are eligible to nominate this week. They have to nominate a housemates of the same gender. Furthermore, these two are immune from eviction. As there have to be 4 housemates up for eviction, the remaining 6 housemates will be split into pairs for an assault course. The slowest pair will also be up for eviction.
<br>As there are more male than female housemates in the house, only the male housemates could be nominated this week.
<br>As decided by Big Brother, all female housemates apart from Anna and Nadine were nominated.
<br>Housemates nominated as normal. As there were only 2 housemates up for eviction, the public chose Orhan and Sascha to also be up for eviction. The 3 non-evicted housemates remained nominated.
<br>Alongside Nadine, Orhan, and Sascha, Anna chose Diana to be her replacement on the nomination list.
<br>Housemates nominated as normal. Geraldine was saved by a public vote.
<br>The male housemates competed against the female housemate in a Fun Fair task. The losing team is automatically nominated.
<br>Every housemate chooses one person who they want to be evicted. The housemate with the most votes is evicted.

The Republican-Socialist Party () was a French socialist political party during the French Third Republic, founded in 1911 and dissolved in 1934. It was founded by socialists who refused to join the SFIO founded in 1905. The PRS was a "reformist socialist" party located between the SFIO and the Radical Socialist Party. PRS member René Viviani was the first French Minister of Labour in 1906.
The PRS was weakened by an ideological contradiction, between socialism and reformism, in an era where the political divide was very sharp. It also suffered from an organizational division between those favouring a united and structured party, like the SFIO, or an independent party with independent personalities. It was dissolved in 1934 and an attempt to recreate it within the Rally of Republican Lefts in 1945 failed.

Little Beaux Pink

Little Beaux Pink is the 50th cartoon produced in the "Pink Panther" series. A total of 124 6-minute cartoons were produced between 1964 and 1980.
Plot.
The Pink Panther had a little lamb, whose fleece was white as snow, and wherever the lamb went to graze, the panther had to go. The panther and his lamb cross a boundary into Cattle County, Texas, and when the lamb begins eating the grass of a hot-headed Texan rancher, the panther must defend himself and his lamb from the Texan's wrath. The panther plants stakes and builds a fence around his lamb's grazing territory, and the Texan, rapidly riding a horse, pounds the stakes almost entirely into the ground.
Undaunted, the panther establishes his own ranch, and the Texan tries to flatten panther and lamb with a huge, rolling stone, which the panther guides through a barn so that it hits a tree branch which recoils it on top of the Texan. The Texan telegrams some hired gunslingers, asking them to eliminate someone who is pink, and when a bucket of the panther's pink paint falls onto the Texan, rendering him pink, the gunslingers arrive and blast him with bullets.

Personal distress

In psychology, personal distress is an aversive, self-focused emotional reaction (e.g., anxiety, worry, discomfort) to the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state or condition. This negative affective state often occurs as a result of emotional contagion when there is confusion between self and other. Unlike empathy, personal distress does not have to be congruent with the other's state, and often leads to a self-oriented, egoistic reaction to reduce it, by withdrawing from the stressor, for example, thereby decreasing the likelihood of prosocial behavior. There is evidence that sympathy and personal distress are subjectively different, have different somatic and physiological correlates, and relate differently to prosocial behavior.
Work in social neuroscience, using functional neuroimaging, shows that the perception of another individual in pain results, in the observer, in the activation of the neural network involved in the processing of firsthand experience of pain. This intimate overlap between the neural circuits responsible for our ability to perceive the pain of others and those underlying our own self-experience of pain can lead to personal distress and can possibly be detrimental to empathic concern. Personal distress may even result in a more egoistic motivation to reduce it, by withdrawing from the stressor, for example, thereby decreasing the likelihood of prosocial behavior.
Link to risk and resistance.
In 1987, one study completed cross-sectional and longitudinal research on a community sample of over 400 adults and their children to examine the link between risk, resistance, and personal distress. Risk factors consisted of negative life events and avoidance coping strategies and, for children, parental emotional and physical distress. Resistance factors were self-confidence, an easygoing disposition, and family support. Outcome criteria were global depression and physical symptoms in adults, and psychological maladjustment and physical health problems in their children.
The survey found that persons who simultaneously experience high risk and low resistance are especially vulnerable to personal distress. The results demonstrated that the risk and resistance variables are significant predictors of concurrent and future psychological and physical distress in adults. In children, the findings demonstrated that parental dysfunction, especially maternal risk factors and family support, are significantly linked to distress. However, these findings also suggested that, in comparison to adults, children may be more resilient to past negative life events affecting their current or future levels of distress. Furthermore, it was noted that children are affected more by mothers' than fathers' functioning, which is congruent with the conventional role of mothers as primary caregivers and with children's relatively stronger maternal attachment relationships.
Development.
A study was conducted with a group of children as well as a separate group of adults; both groups were to watch a video. The video was of a negatively emotional news story. While they watched the video their facial expressions where recorded, as well they self reported how they felt after viewing the video. The results found that there is indeed a stark difference between sympathy and personal distress. Markers of sympathy were related to prosocial responses on the other hand facial indexes of personal distress were unrelated. For adults it was found that facial sadness and concerned attention tended to be positively related to prosocial tendencies, children on the other hand had a negative relationship between prosocial behaviour and facial personal distress. This displays how there is not only an observable difference between sympathy and personal distress. It can also be seen that there is a difference between how children and adults experience either personal distress or sympathy this is largely related to the level of development that the individual has achieved.

Dark Avengers

Dark Avengers is an American comic book series published by Marvel Comics. It is part of a series of titles that have featured various iterations of the superhero team the Avengers. Unusually, the series stars a version of the team that, unknown to the public in its fictional universe, contains several members who are supervillains disguised as established superheroes.
Publication history.
The series debuted with issue #1, dated January 2009, as part of a multi-series story arc entitled "Dark Reign". In the premiere, writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Mike Deodato (working from a continuity begun in a previous, company-wide story arc, "Secret Invasion", involving an infiltration of Earth by the shape-shifting alien Skrulls and that race's eventual defeat) chronicled the aftermath of the U.S. government's disbanding of the federally sanctioned superhero team, the Avengers. Bendis described the thinking behind the team: "These are bad-ass, hardcore get-it-done types. They'll close the door and take care of business and he's dressing them up to make them something that the people want". This is in contrast to the changes Norman Osborn is shown making to the Thunderbolts, where, according to writer Andy Diggle, he turns that team into "something much more covert and much more lethal: his own personal hit squad".
The series ended with "Dark Avengers" #16, at the culmination of the Siege storyline.
As of the 175th issue of Thunderbolts it will be retitled Dark Avengers.
Plot.
The government assigned the team's redevelopment to Norman Osborn (the reformed supervillain now calling himself the Iron Patriot) whom the government had previously assigned to head the superhero team the Thunderbolts and who had become a public hero for his role in repelling the Skrull threat. Osborn, also given leadership of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., reforms that agency into H.A.M.M.E.R. and creates a new Avengers team under its aegis.
Issues #1-6.
The initial line-up consists of former Thunderbolts members and new recruits, including the Sentry, Ares, Noh-Varr (now Captain Marvel) as well as disguised super-villains Moonstone (portraying Ms. Marvel), Venom (Mac Gargan, portraying Spider-Man after being given a formula that resets the symbiote to the size it was when it possessed Spider-Man), Bullseye (portraying Hawkeye) and Wolverine's disgruntled son Daken taking on the Wolverine mantle. Osborn also takes on the identity of Iron Patriot, wearing a red white and blue themed Iron Man armor. The team goes to Latveria to rescue Doctor Doom from Morgan Le Fay. Upon returning from Latveria, Osborn deals with the aftermath of Ronin's appearance on live TV reminding the public of Osborn's murderous past and that he should not be trusted.
Issues #7-8 (Utopia Crossover).
The Dark Avengers arrive in San Francisco to set up martial law and to quell the anti-mutant riots. In doing so, Norman sets up his own team of X-Men consisting of Cloak and Dagger, Mimic, Emma Frost, Namor the Sub-Mariner, Daken, Weapon Omega and Mystique (posing as Professor X) much to the chagrin of his Avengers. After Emma Frost, Namor, and Cloak and Dagger betray the team, Norman swears vengeance on the X-Men.
Issues #9-12.
A series of disappearances throughout Colorado causes Norman Osborn's Dark Avengers, except for Venom, to visit the small town of Dinosaur, Colorado. Everyone except Norman is teleported away, while Osborn finds himself in front of a throne with Molecule Man seated on it, flanked by the Beyonder, Mephisto, Zarathos, and the Enchantress. However, it is revealed that these others were merely Molecule Man's creations. Molecule Man tortures Norman mentally and physically and seemingly kills his Avengers. Osborn's assistant, Victoria Hand, successfully stalls Molecule Man with a false surrender until the Void is able to reform and kill Molecule Man. It is revealed that the Sentry and the Void have the same powers as Molecule Man. The Sentry regains control of himself and agrees to begin therapy with Moonstone, while Victoria Hand demands Norman to undergo therapy as well after being tortured. Inside his office, Loki is manipulating Norman into having a Green Goblin relapse.
Issues #13-16 (Siege Tie-Ins).
After declaring war on the Asgardians, Norman Osborn has the Dark Avengers and those in prepare for the invasion of Asgard. Norman considers The Sentry, specifically his dark side, known as The Void, his secret weapon.
In flashback, it is told how Robert Reynolds received his vast powers from experimental drugs, using his might as the Sentry to live the life of a superhero, while his darker emotions manifested as the Void. Osborn has manipulated Reynolds into allowing the Void to take over, to do Osborn's murderous bidding. Osborn has somehow recreated the addictive serum that gave Reynolds his powers, making him dependent on Osborn and his approval. Meanwhile, Reynolds's wife Lindy has been a virtual prisoner in the Sentry's Watchtower, has even attempted to kill him, and begs Reynolds to either kill her or let her go. Reynolds's warring personalities, however, have stalemated. The Sentry even attempts suicide, flying into the heart of the sun, but such is his invulnerability that it doesn't work. He tires of struggling against the Void. Norman orders Bullseye to kill Lindy, blaming her for Sentry's uncertainty and weakness. When an emergency evacuation occurs, Bullseye takes Lindy on a helicopter, antagonizes her cruelly, then strangles her to death and dumps her body into the ocean. When Sentry arrives looking for Lindy, Bullseye claims that she committed suicide, out of fear of Reynolds, by jumping out of the helicopter in the countryside. Sentry leaves to look for her body. From this point on, it could be said that the murderous Void was in full control of Reynolds and his unprecedented power.
Following the events of Siege, Norman Osborn is incarcerated in The Raft penitentiary. Moonstone, Bullseye and Venom are captured by the heroes, while Daken manages to escape capture by military personnel. After being interrogated by Captain Rogers, Victoria Hand is informed that she has been reassigned.
Post-"Siege".
Moonstone joins the new Luke Cage led incarnation of the Thunderbolts. Noh-Varr is recruited into the Avengers team to help them build a time machine to save the future. Victoria Hand is assigned by Steve Rogers to be the liaison for Luke Cage's team of Avengers, dubbed the New Avengers, because he feels that she can provide an important insight to the team. Bullseye escapes custody and is killed by his old nemesis Daredevil when he attacks his fortress of Shadowland. Daken eludes capture at the conclusion of the Siege and is confronted by Franken-Castle (who he had killed during the Dark Reign). Mac Gargan's symbiote was removed and he was taken into custody. He was later broken out by Alistair Smythe and transformed back into the Scorpion.
The New Dark Avengers.
A new Dark Avengers team formed by Norman Osborn and H.A.M.M.E.R. The roster includes Skaar, Gorgon, Ai Apaec, Dr. June Covington, Superia, and Trickshot and the team is backed up by HYDRA and A.I.M. Norman Osborn also has A.I.M. rebuild Ragnarok so that he can join the Dark Avengers. Although Osborn claims to be certain that his new team is superior to their "templates," he appears unaware that Madame Hydra and Gorgon are already planning to kill him once he proves himself to be too dangerous as leader, intending to use his team to sow discord by serving as a voice of the "disenfranchised" unsatisfying with the status quo. The subsequent fight against the New Avengers proves to be relatively evenly-matched. Although Osborn demonstrates a surprising new level of strength allowing him to throw Luke Cage a considerable distance and his Scarlet Witch injures Doctor Strange, the others are able to hold their own far more easily. When their attempt to teleport away, the New Avengers end up facing Ragnarok. Spider-Man and Iron Fist are able to defeat Ragnarok, but the Dark Avengers' actions have still damaged the New Avengers' reputations by tricking them into provoking a fight with a team who just helped the civilians, Osborn's other forces attacking the main team to charge them with various war crimes, ordering the President to declare Osborn the new head of world security and put the Avengers on trial. However, although the Dark Avengers capture Captain America during their successful attack on both Avengers teams with the intention of executing him for his 'crimes', Gorgon and Superia are already planning to betray the team, Victoria Hand apparently Norman's double agent inside the team revealing her real allegiance to Captain America to the New Avengers, and Skaar turning on his teammates after they confirm their intentions to assault Captain America, proclaiming ""Avengers Assemble"" as he does so. Skaar reveals that he is a double agent for Captain America allowing the New Avengers to defeat the rest of the team. Norman Osborn is shown to have developed the abilities of the Super-Adaptoid enabling him to copy the abilities of the other Avengers. The Avengers find a way to overload this power which puts Norman Osborn into a coma. After Osborn is defeated, the rest of the Dark Avengers are detained and suggested in a conversation with Captain America to be considered for the Thunderbolts Program.
Thunderbolts.
As of #175, "Thunderbolts" is renamed "Dark Avengers" with writer Jeff Parker and the art team of Kev Walker and Declan Shalvey remaining on the title.
When the Thunderbolts are missing in the time stream, the Dark Avengers were recruited as a replacement team. In order to keep the Dark Avengers in line, they were implanted with nanites in order to prevent them from going rogue, and placed under the leadership of Luke Cage.
The Dark Avengers team are thrown into an alternate world with John Walker where they are captured by that reality's version of Iron Man. Iron Man and Henry Pym wonder who they are as they don't match their counterparts of their universe. Iron Man assumes that Mister Fantastic is responsible for Ragnarok and flies off, while Henry Pym stays behind to disable the Dark Avengers' control nanites and replace them with their own control devices. As he gets to work, June Covington begins to regain consciousness. Meanwhile, Skaar regains his senses and asks himself how he got from Sharzhad to Manhattan. He is then attacked by a squadron of Iron Men (who assume him to be a cheap knockoff of the Hulk). He briefly fights them until the army shows up. Then someone grabs Skaar and carries him away. His rescuer is Moonstone. She explains that when the Quinjet fell out of the sky due to June Covington's sabotage, she flew up to intercept. At the same time, Man-Thing opened a portal to save them, but has sent them to another universe. Before Moonstone and Skaar could plan their next move, they accidentally stumble in Strangetown and are caught by its mystical defenses. As soon as Doctor Strange whisks them away, two men in yellow armor emerge from a portal as they wonder who the two strangers were. While unconscious, John Walker is examined by an alternate reality Hank Pym and determined to be "John Walker, ex-Marine Captain."
Meanwhile, Doctor Strange probes the minds of Skaar and Moonstone to learn how they got here. Afterwards, he plans to use them as an advantage for a turf war that he is in. Having gotten control of Henry Pym, June Covington learns the history of this reality and then uses some Stark teleportation tech to remove a device from Ragnarok's brain. Meanwhile, Doctor Strange uses a spell that alters Moonstone's appearance to that of Captain Marvel. Planning to use Moonstone and Skaar in their turf war, Doctor Strange and Clea embrace as their pet Tigra watches on. The two men in yellow armor appear outside of the Baxter Building where one of them contemplates a security drone before he is killed by the other one who escapes before he can be captured. While in a turf war against Thing and his monsters on Yancy Street, Doctor Strange tells Moonstone that New York City is the last habitable place since the event where Thor and Hulk had killed each other. At the same time, Clea brings Skaar to Iron Man's territory in the Iron Zone where they fight a bunch of Iron Men. Iron Man is unaware that Henry Pym has fallen under the control of June Covington. June Covington is seemingly able to restore John Walker's lost limbs with help from this reality's version of the Venom symbiote in lobotomized form. Barney Barton wakes up in Iron Man's lab to see U.S. Agent restored, Ragnarok still unconscious, and Ai Apaec in miniature form. June Covington brings them up to speed about the world that they are in as they watch the turf war on a nearby screen where they are unaware that the turf war was caused by this reality's Doctor Strange. When they see Moonstone and Skaar taking part in the gang war, they are informed by Ai Apaec who happens to recognize the mark of Doctor Strange on them and witness both sides of the turf war being halted by the arrival of Namor and his queen Invisible Woman (who had been driven over the edge following the deaths of Captain America, Thor, and Human Torch) who give them 24 hours to evacuate before Namor can flood the city. Upon hearing the news, U.S. Agent and the Dark Avengers formulate a plan that they must kill this reality's Doctor Strange and free Skaar and Moonstone before the flood can happen. But they do not know that they themselves are being watched by the men in suits who are somehow controlling that reality and who do not want to see that control broken. When Mister Fantastic speaks with Thing, Skaar approaches Thing asking him to remove the slave spell casted by Doctor Strange. Thing then has Moonstone brought in and mistook her for Alicia Masters. Mister Fantastic tells Moonstone to play along so that they can get through to Thing. Thing then recalls that Alicia Masters is dead and has Halar and the Moloids bring Moonstone to a cell in order to ready her for gladiatorial combat.
Meanwhile, Iron Man returns to his tower and finds that Henry Pym is experimenting on Ragnarok by removing his control implant. He also notices that the other Dark Avengers are missing. When Henry Pym mentions having regrown U.S. Agent's limbs and shrunk Ai Apaec, Iron Man lashes out at him and realizes that Henry Pym's control implant had been reworked. A microscopic Wasp is watching this on her monitor in her petri dish, and begs to be wakened from her nightmare. The Dark Avengers make their way through Hell's Kitchen to get to Strangetown. They come across a building covered with webs as Ai Apaec claims that this world's Spider-Man had gone under a profound change to have created a long-lasting web. The Dark Avengers are then attacked by Spider-Man's gang (consisting of this reality's versions of Colleen Wing, Daredevil, Hawkeye, Iron Fist, Misty Knight, and Shang-Chi). This world's version of Hawkeye mistook Barney Barton as his brother. Though U.S. Agent begs them to let them pass, Iron Fist and Shang-Chi attack. Ai Apaec tells Barney to load him onto an arrow and fire it at Spider-Man. Spider-Man's Spider-Senses go off and he catches the arrow as Ai Apaec and Spider-Man speak in a different language while the other Dark Avengers have been subdued. Moonstone is pitted against all of Thing's monsters. When Thing tells Halar to use lethal force, Skaar can do nothing but watch as Moonstone disintegrates. As Halar is vaporizing Moonstone, the two hidden figures talk about Halar's powers and plans to take it. Mister Fantastic manages to reveal them as Skaar grabs one of them before they can phase out. Skaar asks Mister Fantastic if it's true that the mysterious group to whom their captive belongs to is manipulating this world.
Meanwhile in Hell's Kitchen, the Dark Avengers have been captured by Spider-Man's gang as they demand to know what they did to Hawkeye. With help from Ai Apaec, June Covington tells them that they had poisoned Hawkeye on his left side and that the venom must be sucked out. Colleen Wing moves into action while Shang-Chi demands to know why June Covington is dressed like Scarlet Witch. Misty Knight assumes that since they were heading for Strangetown, they must be working for Doctor Strange. U.S. Agent insists that they were going to stop Doctor Strange (who had restarted the turf wars) and save the whole city. Daredevil punches Barney Barton stating that there are no heroes anymore. Just superhumans who fight each other constantly. June Convington mentally suggests luring in their captors and gas them, but U.S. Agent denies her, reasoning that her toxin would be blown away in the wind. Instead, U.S. Agent notes out loud that Hell's Kitchen has been kept independent of the other superhuman factions. Misty Knight explains that Spider-Man had changed. His webbing doesn't stick to his allies, Grimm's monsters can't stand the smell of it, and it screw up the Iron Men armors. Suddenly, the Dark Avengers are freed from the webbing as Spider-Man doesn't consider them enemies and agrees to accompany them to Strangetown along with a select few of his gang. At Stark Tower, Pepper Potts states that she needs some rest with Invisibile Woman assisting in flooding the city tomorrow. When War Machine asks Iron Man why he is so restless, Iron Man states that they can't take a break without their foes attempting to evict humanity. Pepper asks that he look at her, reasoning that she hasn't seen his face in months. Iron Man ignores her and calls Henry Pym to ask about the status of the neutron bomb to everyone's surprise. Henry Pym answers that he's using Ragnarok to power it.
Meanwhile, A.I.M. has been manipulating this reality and they start to panic when one of their own is being held captive. One A.I.M. Agent states that due to the Dark Avengers' arrival, the solar system is starting to disappear. Back underground, Skaar pries the mask off the captive A.I.M. Agent who pinches his nose to evade contracting any viruses. Skaar then starts questioning them, but the A.I.M. Agent refuses to talk. Mister Fantastic asks why Skaar is working for Grimm. Struggling against Doctor Strange's slave spell, Skaar explains in broken sentences that he's from another Earth and that he's being controlled. Mister Fantastic asks if his Fantastic Four is still a team on his Earth to which Skaar confirms. He then turns his attention to the A.I.M. Agent and identifies him as A.I.M. and accuses him of warping time. But before they could get any further, Thing interrupts and assumes that the A.I.M. Agent is another spy. He attempts to drag him to the arena where he would be killed. To avoid letting their answers slip away, Mister Fantastic goads Thing into taking him instead by mentioning Alicia's name. As a frustrated Skaar looks on, he notices that Mister Fantastic has written in the sand "Make him reveal access point". Meanwhile, the Dark Avengers and Spider-Man's gang arrive in Strangetown where they are attacked by the All-Seeing Eye and the Soulsnake. Ai Apaec tells Spider-Man to cast some webbing and give Barney Barton a sword which he uses to destroy the Soulsnake while Spider-Man lands a hard kick to the All-Seeing Eye. Unfortunately, Tigra ambushed Spider-Man slashing him across the throat. Doctor Strange himself then appears noting that it was worthwhile losing two valuable objects to bring down Spider-Man. Collen Wing then asks U.S. Agent if he has a plan, to which he answers he's working on it.
Back at Stark Tower, Ragnarok awakens as Henry Pym attempts to get his attention. But as Henry Pym expresses relief that he's finally getting out of his lab, Ragnarok spots an invisible Moonstone signalling him to remain silent. When Mister Fantastic insists that their reality is being manipulated, Thing is in the process of mangling him. Thing then turns his attention to Skaar (who is in the middle of interrogating the A.I.M. agent) guessing that he's from his Earth as to how to return home. Doctor Strange's slave spell forces him to obey. Thing accuses him of being in league with Richards and orders him to show his loyalty: to men or monsters. At Stark Tower, Moonstone materializes before Henry Pym and Ragnarok. Henry Pym asks how did she get in. She explains that when Thing's monster attempted to vaporize her, her intangibility powers kicked back in and she escaped. This also weakened Doctor Strange's spell on her as long as she stayed intangible. She then asks Henry Pym as to where the other Dark Avengers are. He shows her recordings of them planning to kill Doctor Strange. Henry Pym then says he needs to finish restoring his microscopic wife Wasp before asking if he can come with her. Suddenly, they are interrupted by Iron Man who then attacks. With the slave spell attempting to reassert it's hold on her, Moonstone goes intangible as Iron Man hits Henry Pym. Out of his arms pop more weapons, but Ragnarok gets up and attacks him. He tears off his left arm revealing "Iron Man" to be a robot or so it seems. After knocking off his head, it is revealed that Iron Man is just a brain in a jar which ejects out of the chest and flies off. A badly wounded Henry Pym confesses that Tony Stark had him remove his organs to make more room for weaponry. Moonstone then tells Ragnarok that they have to help the others. The Thor clone confesses that he no longer possess his faux Mjolnir, but that gives Moonstone an idea. As they leave, Henry Pym throws a switch to activate the Pym Particles.
In Strangetown, Iron Fist attacks Doctor Strange out of rage for the death of Spider-Man only to charge into a trap. Doctor Strange conjures a maw on his chest and engulfs Iron Fist consuming his focused chi. Meanwhile, Ai Apaec is climbing Doctor Strange's leg, telepathically calling the Dark Avengers to summon an object contained by Spider-Man's webs which would grant him the perfect distraction. When Thing orders Skaar to kill Mister Fantastic, he struggles to fight the slave spell casted on him. U.S. Agent tells Misty Knight to summon Captain America's shield with her bionic hand. The shield comes flying in, just as Doctor Strange conjures up a deadly spell, only for it to deflect off the shield and kill Clea. Enraged, Doctor Strange readies an even more powerful spell, but Ai Apaec hits him with all the poison he had killing Doctor Strange and ending his slave spell on Moonstone and Skaar.
At that moment, Skaar turns on Thing. As Moonstone and Ragnarok arrive at the sight where this Earth's Thor died fighting Hulk and where his Mjolnir lies, the A.I.M. cell is observing Iron Man's brain inserting himself into a massive armor. One A.I.M. Agent wants to continue observing, but another A.I.M. Agent warns the A.I.M. Agent that this reality's going to collapse in less than an hour. Thus, A.I.M. mobilizes to finish their work. Ragnarok acknowledges that he's just a copy of the real Thor and that he does not know who or what he is. He then grasps the hammer. Lightning then strikes and Ragnarok emerges with a new look. As Namor and Invisible Woman arrive to wipe Manhattan off the globe, Skaar is punched up from the ground by Thing for his betrayal as Mister Fantastic threatens to choke the A.I.M. Agent for information. As Thing's monsters relentlessly attack Skaar, June Covington manages to make telepathic contact with him, promising to send him help, even though he refuses it. Elsewhere, Iron Man unleashes his largest and most powerful armor against Namor and Invisible Woman. Before Thing could have Halar execute Skaar, Moonstone appears and gloats that she's invincible. Thing retorts that he'll kill her one way or the other. And right on cue, Ragnarok comes crashing down devastating Thing's monsters. As Iron Man starts to gloat about the superiority of technology, War Machine thinks that Iron Man has lost it and leads the other Iron Men into fleeing the city. Yet Iron Man has heard that and forces Rescue to kill him and then has his forces wipe out the rest of Thing. Thing focuses on Skaar intent on beating him to death only for U.S. Agent to intervene. U.S. Agent hands Skaar his sword which Spider-Man found enabling him to impale Thing. At the same time, the Iron Force arrives. U.S. Agent calls the Dark Avengers together and tells them that they must find Mister Fantastic. Luckily, he comes right to them. He reveals from his interrogation of the A.I.M. agent that the A.I.M. he belongs to had been secretly altering this reality. It all began when Kang the Conqueror attacked the Avengers. The A.I.M. sect calculated that he was due to return soon and established a base a block from Avengers Tower. As Kang the Conqueror kept attacking, A.I.M. was able to capture a "sliver of time", enabling them to alter the history people in it. This alternate reality was a running experiment to A.I.M. studying outcomes and gathering any weapons that were developed back into real time. But since the Dark Avengers came here, the sliver is starting to collapse and will end their nightmare. Just then, Iron Man arrives where he had heard the whole thing and doesn't believe it as he throws Invisible Woman towards them. He demands that everyone either serve him or die. He then takes note of his Iron Force arriving when they should be fighting the monsters and states that they can't disobey him. Rescue remarks that he said to destroy all monsters.
At that moment, a giant-sized Wasp attacks where she was enraged at his murder of her husband and tears Iron Man's armor apart. Tony Stark's brain flies out intent on getting to a new body, but Trickshot swiftly kills him. Trickshot remarks that not even Hawkeye could do that but someone else says he could've. U.S. Agent asks Mister Fantastic if there's no way to undo the damage. Mister Fantastic confesses that the sliver is close to disintegration and as the Dark Avengers did not originate from it, they'll die if they stay. As the sliver dies, all the people in it will fold in with real time that actually happened and everyone will think that this was all a bad dream. The Dark Avengers race to find the A.I.M. base. Their arrival is detected and the A.I.M. Agents attempt to close the sliver gate, but Ragnarok manages to keep it open for the entire team to enter. They then find the controls for the sliver of time and accelerate its destruction. The A.I.M. Agents offer to cooperate and surrender in exchange for fair trial. However, the Dark Avengers aren't interested in arresting them. Ten minutes later, the Dark Avengers arrive back in their world.

Orthopterida

The Orthopterida is a superorder of the Polyneoptera that represents the extant orders Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets, and katydids), and Phasmatodea (stick insects and leaf insects). The Orthopterida also includes the extinct orders Titanoptera and Caloneurodea. There is general consensus of monophyly in this superorder, based on reduction of the second valvulae, an ovipositor derived from the gonoplac, and an enlarged precostal region on the forewing. 
The two other superorders of the Polyneoptera are the Plecopterida, which represents the orders Plecoptera (stoneflies), Emboidea (Embioptera/Embiidina; webspinners), and Zoraptera (angel insects), and the Dictyoptera, which represents Blattaria (cockroaches), Isoptera (termites), and Mantodea (mantids). Two other orders, the Notoptera (ice-crawlers and gladiators) and Dermaptera (earwigs) are also placed in the Polyneoptera but outside of the superorders discussed above.

Barton-Lackey Cabin

The Barton-Lackey Cabin, also known as the Barton Cattle Camp and the Lackey Cattle Camp, was built in 1910 in the Roaring River Canyon of what became Kings Canyon National Park in California. The cabin was a shelter for stockmen using the summer range in the upper Kings River Canyon summer range, at an elevation of 7400 feet. The cabin was once surrounded by a significant number of outbuildings, which have all disappeared.
James DeCamp Barton and his father, Hudson DeCamp Barton first used summer pasturage in the upper Roaring River area about 1907. Their home range was in the Sierra Nevada foothills near Auckland, California. About 1910 they built the cabin at Scaffold Meadow. In the early 1920s H.D. Barton's daughter Sylvia married Al Lackey, a forest ranger. Taking over the family cattle operation, Lackey used the Roaring River range until the establishment of Kings Canyon National Park in 1940. Lackey received a lifetime use permit from the National Park Service that continued until two years after Mrs. J.D. Barton's death in 1956. The cabin was used as a storage shed by the Park Service from that time.
The property was designated on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 for its significance in local ranching and settlement.

Elkhorn Area Middle School

Elkhorn Area Middle School is a public school in Elkhorn, Wisconsin serving students in grade 6-8.
History.
The school was built in 2004 to replace the old Middle school, which is now Jackson, one of three elementary schools. The other two being Tibbets Elementary school, and Westside Elementary school.
Campus.
The current building was designed by Eppstein Uhen Architects. The grounds include basketball hoops and two football fields. The Basketball courts are in the parking lot, as that half is clear most of the time. However, when the school is hosting an event, this area is used for parking. There is also a running track (yellow lines) that surrounds the basketball court. The buses park on one side of the track, which is parallel with a raised sidewalk. This leads to the side of the school, and the cafeteria. There are two sets of doors that open up to the sidewalk. There is a field that's adjacent to the basketball court. It's surrounded by prairie, and is big enough to have two events housed here at the same time. There's a garden on one side of the field. On one side of the garden is a pond (a second pond is also on this side of the school), and in front of that is grass. The grass connects with a concrete path that connects to the sidewalk adjacent to the basketball court. It goes around the school and connects to a platform at the main entrance to the school. This path also has a portion that branches off and leads to the Walworth County Fair Grounds.
Curriculum.
In addition to the core subjects, students may take classes in art, computers, Health, German, Spanish, and technical education. Each grade is split apart into two "teams." For sixth grade, the teams are Purple and Gold. The seventh grade teams are White and Patriot. Eighth grade teams are All Stars and Power House. Each team has the same core classes at the same time, versus the rotation in classes such as German, Spanish, Computers, Health, Technical education, and Art.
Extracurricular activities.
Elkhorn Area Middle School offers a great variety of sports clubs and groups. Some of the sports include baseball, cross country, basketball, track, and football. In addition to sports a newspaper club is available which was added in 2008.

Kuguzade Suleyman Pasha

Kuguzade Suleyman Pasha was appointed by Sultan Selim III as the governor of Trabzon state in 1791. The Sultan's order was received after the critical loss of Anapa Fortress to Russians, which was regarded as the gate to Caucasus for the Ottomans, in 1791 and also the deterioration of the public order. The governor responsible of the loss of Anapa was Sari Abdullah Pasha, and the Ottoman Sultan Selim requested his execution to Kuguzade Suleyman Pasha. Then, Sari Abdullah Pasha was trapped and executed in Erzurum by Kuguzade in the same year. During the rule of Kuguzade, public order was achieved again, and further attacks to Russians were managed. Today, his grave still can be seen in the family graveyard of Kugu & Kuguoglu family in Cavuslu town of Trabzon, located as adjacent to Black Sea Highway. His Ottoman Style impressive gravestone, after having endured the many looting attempts, still worthwhile to see.

Conceição de Ipanema

Conceição de Ipanema is a Brazilian municipality situated in State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. It has an area of 234Km2. Its population is 4,336.
History.
The region was first inhabited by Indians Aimorés. The first white to reach those lands was José Pedro de Alcantara, followed by Manoel Francisco de Paula Cunha, the National Guard deserter, fugitive of the War of Santa Luzia, in 1842. The town had its beginning on the farm of Francis Ignatius Fernandes Leon, in 1850. That year, the farmer had built a chapel on his property in honor of Our Lady of Conception. In 1920, a group of people led by José da Luz Laudelino acquired the land and donated the farm to the Catholic Church. From 1917, work began on the German migration to the region with the acquisition of land by the Stream of funnel descendants of German Carlos Henrique Saar, John Kaiser and Anthony Keller with strong influence in the culture of the city. 
The town of Conception in the town of Ipanema, grew to become the district on December 27, 1948 by Law No. 336, under the name of Conceição de Ipanema. The district was promoted to the council on December 12, 1953 by Law No. 1039. The January 31, 1955, the City Council was installed and Antonio Heringer became the first mayor, had the vice-mayor José de Oliveira. José Pedro River, which rises at the side of the river flows and Caparaó Doce, the council cut in half, forming four five beaches and waterfalls, recreational items for the population. The river received its name in honor of pioneer José Pedro de Alcantara. The toponymy Conceição de Ipanema is composed of two expressions: Conception is the patroness of the city and Ipanema connects to the name of the neighboring municipality to which belonged. Ipanema word comes from the Tupi language Y-panéma "bad water, bad for river fishing."

Wolverhampton Street School

Wolverhampton Street School was a secondary school located in Dudley, Worcestershire (now West Midlands), England.
The school was opened in 1880 on Wolverhampton Street in the west of Dudley town centre, an area which was heavily developed for housing during the 19th century to accommodate workers drawn to the town as a result of the Industrial Revolution.
The school's most notable pupil, Duncan Edwards, started in 1948 and left in 1952. He was a highly successful member of the school's football team and also represented the England team at schoolboy level, as well as several other teams outside the school. He signed for Manchester United on leaving school and within three years had gained full international recognition, regarded by many as the finest footballer of the decade. He was capped 18 times by England and gaining two Football League championship medals with Manchester United before he died in February 1958, aged 21, from injuries sustained in the Munich air disaster.
By the start of the 1960s, the Wolverhampton Street School buildings were becoming increasingly dilapidated and unsuitable for modern standards. In response to this, Dudley council drew up plans to relocate the school to a new site. Construction work began in 1963 on a new school on Wrens Hill Road, which runs between the Wren's Nest and Priory estates approximately one mile to the north of Dudley town centre. The new school was opened in April 1965 and named Wren's Nest Secondary School, becoming Mons Hill School a decade later. This school in turn closed in July 1990, after only 25 years in use, with pupils and staff being split between Castle High and The Coseley School and the Mons Hill buildings being taken over by Dudley College.
Meanwhile, the Wolverhampton Street School was demolished in 1966 and the site redeveloped as a public car park, although the schoolhouse at the rear of where the school building once stood remains standing to this day.

David Ross (businessman)

David Peter John Ross (born 10 July 1965 in Grimsby, Lincolnshire), is an English businessman and the co-founder (with school friend Charles Dunstone) of The Carphone Warehouse. A profile in the "Sunday Times" Rich List put his current net worth at £710 million in 2013.However he is not listed as a British US$ billionaire by Forbes 2014 Billionaire list which would suggest a considerably lower figure. At the peak valuation of his business interests in 2008, Ross was one of the 100 richest people in the United Kingdom.
Prior to Carphone Warehouse.
Ross is the grandson of (John) Carl Ross, who created one of the UK's largest commercial fishing firms from the family business, and two listed companies: Ross Frozen Foods which he created; and purchase of the Great Grimsby Coal, Salt and Tanning Company (known as Cosalt), which was founded in 1873 as a cooperative that sold all the supplies needed to run a fishing fleet, listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1971.Ross put his hundred and forty year old family firm Cosalt into administration in February 2013
Born in Grimsby and raised in Lincolnshire, Ross was educated at Uppingham School, where he and Charles Dunstone became friends; and then studied law at Nottingham University.
At the age of 16, Ross's father sent him to work on a building site in Algeria, which he later described as a defining moment "because it was so bad I knew I had to get away from it and be able to control my destiny." On graduation from Nottingham University, Ross joined Arthur Andersen and became a chartered accountant, staying there from 1988 to 1991.
The Carphone Warehouse.
In 1989, Ross agreed to join Dunstone, who was ploughing £6,000 of his savings into a business selling mobile phones. They formed The Carphone Warehouse, in a flat on Harley Street, London, which four years later had grown to 20 stores. Now also trading as "The Phone House," The Carphone Warehouse is Europe's largest independent mobile phone retailer.
While Dunstone became the public face of Carphone, Ross (described by Dunstone as his "secret weapon"), developed and drove the high street retail footprint of the company by buying Tandy in the UK, and developing "The Phone House" across Europe and the United States. When Ross led the IPO of Carphone Warehouse in 2000, it had been so successful that the partners had not needed to borrow or involve outsiders: Dunstone owned half, Ross a third, and business partner Guy Johnson most of the rest.
Ross had been joint-Chief Operating Officer with Dunstone from 1990 and 2003, whereas Dunstone stayed with the business that he still runs today, Ross started to give up his executive position from 2003. Ross became deputy chairman in July 2005, and by 2008 was a non-executive director. He resigned from Carphone Warehouse, National Express and Big Yellow in December of that year after using a large proportion of his shares in the businesses as collateral for personal loans without informing the companies, which is a breach of stock market rules. However, shortly afterwards, the Financial Services Authority admitted that its rules on the issue were unclear and that a large number of other directors had used their shares in a similar fashion. Owing to the confusion of its rules, the FSA subsequently cleared Ross and provided an amnesty to other directors during which they could declare their share arrangements without censure.
Other business activities.
From 2001 until the events of late 2008, Ross was the chairman of National Express. He also had directorships of several other companies, including family founded ship supply group Cosalt (formerly chairman, a job he took over from his father), publishing and newspaper group Trinity Mirror, Big Yellow Storage, ITIS and Intrinsic Value. Ross was formerly a director of Frontiers Capital. In 2006, Ross set up a commercial property joint venture with investment bank Morgan Stanley, into which he injected his private property portfolio, Kandahar Real Estate Ltd, worth £243 million. Following the property market crash in 2008 Lloyds Bank took control of Kandahar's property assets and sold them all to clear Ross's debt. Kandahar is now involved in ventures outside property.
Ross has recently resigned as Deputy Chairman of the Humberside LEP citing a lack of local business interests.
Ross, who has a strong personal interest in sport, was also on the board of the reconstruction of Wembley Stadium; and was part of the consortium which rescued Leicester City Football Club from receivership, before it was later sold to Milan Mandarić.
Ross family company Cosalt was put into administration in February 2013. It passed a £51,820,225 pension deficit to the taxpayer backed Pension Protection Fund. The administrators are PwC. PwC sold the Ballyclare division of Cosalt to Ross for £5.8m.
Outside business.
Politics.
Ross was a member of the Home Office Audit Committee and Lord Carter's Review of Legal Aid Procurement.He is a member of the Conservative Party Leaders Group, having donated over £50,000 to the Conservative Party during 2013.
Personal life.
Ross is unmarried, and has a son, Carl, with Michelle Ross. After the murder of his stepsister Fiona Marshall and her boyfriend Richard Flippance at the property in 2006 by her ex-husband Alex, Ross placed the property on the market for £7.75 million in 2008. Ross's main residence is the 700-year-old Nevill Holt estate in Leicestershire, which he bought in 2000. He has a further home in Kensington, London.
In January 2010 a Lithuanian escort girl claimed she was invited to Ross's home and then attacked during an argument about cash. Two months later Ross was cleared of any offence by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Charitable, educational and arts.
Ross founded the David Ross Foundation, an independent grant-making foundation. The vision of which stems from its belief that “every child can do something well” and its “intention to help them discover their strengths by offering them a wide range of world class educational opportunities.” The Foundation is active in the arts, music and sport, but particularly education. Via the David Ross Education Trust, the Foundation has sponsored over 20 schools to become academies. The first to do so was Havelock Academy in Grimsby, which was set up in 2007. A full list can be found at DRET.co.uk.
Ross was appointed to the board of the National Portrait Gallery by Tony Blair in 2006; and in the summer hosts the Nevill Holt Opera. He is also a member of Nottingham University's Council. In May 2012, Ross participated in 'The Dallaglio Flintoff Cycle Slam 2012' charity cycle ride from Olympia, Greece to Stratford, London in aid of Andrew Flintoff and Lawrence Dallaglio's respective charities.
He also owns a collection of modern art.
Sport.
He was appointed to London United, in a minor role, the body supporting the capital's bid to be a host city for the 2018 World Cup bid. The £19m bid failed with less than 10% of the vote being awarded to England. The tournament was awarded to Russia.
After Boris Johnson was elected Mayor of London, in May 2008 Ross was Johnson's nominee to the board of the London Organising Committee of the 2012 Olympic Games. He resigned from this position December 2008 in the wake of the same event that led to his departure from the board of Carphone Warehouse.
Ross utilises his sporting influence to provide opportunities for young children in academies supported by The David Ross Education Trust. Students at the sponsored academies have previously met sporting personalities such as Olympians Mark Lewis Francis, Andy Turner, Jazmin Sawyers amongst others.
Currently in 2013, Ross is a member of the Commonwealth Games England board. He is also a Non-Executive Director of the British Olympic Association.
Ross sits on the Board of London Legacy Development Corporation which has responsibility for redevelopment of Olympic Park in Legacy mode. This appointment was made by Ross friend and Mayor of London, Boris Johnson

In 1999 Regan won a fourth set of county and provincial winners’ medals, however, Birr were later defeated in the All-Ireland semi-final. He added a fifth county championship title to his ever-growing collection in 2000.
Minor and under-21.
Regan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Offaly minor hurling team in the mid-1980s. In 1986 he captured a Leinster title in that grade following a 4-7 to 1-5 trouncing of Wexford. Regan later lined out in the subsequent All-Ireland final with Cork providing the opposition. After an exciting game of hurling Offaly were the victors by 3-12 to 3-9, giving Regan a coveted All-Ireland winners’ medal at minor level.
Regan subsequently joined the Offaly under-21 hurling team. After back-to-back defeated in provincial finals in 1987 and 1988, Regan captured a Leinster title in that grade in 1989. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Offaly against Tipperary. The game was a high-scoring one, however, Tipp were the victors by 4-10 to 3-11.
Senior.
By this stage Regan was also a member of the Offaly senior hurling team. He made his championship debut against Laois in the provincial championship in 1989 and later captured his first Leinster title as Offaly defeated Kilkenny in the provincial final. Offaly were the hot favourites going into the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final with Antrim, however, victory went to the Ulster men on a score line of 4-15 to 1-15. The significance of this victory was not lost on Offaly team as the entire team gave the Antrim players a guard of honor and a standing ovation as they left the field.
In 1990 Offaly were the masters of Leinster once again, with Regan picking up a second provincial winners’ medal following a 1-19 to 2-11 win over Dublin. Regan later lined out in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final, however, Galway were the victor son that occasion by 1-16 to 2-7.
At the start of 1991 Offaly reached the final of the National Hurling League. Wexford were the opponents on that occasion, however, after a tense game Offaly took the victory and Regan won a coveted National League winners’ medal. Offaly lost their provincial crown later that year.
After a few years out of the limelight Offaly bounced back in 1994. That year Regan added a third Leinster winners’ medal to his collection following a 1-18 to 0-14 victory over Wexford. After defeating Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final, Regan later lined out against Limerick in the All-Ireland final. With five minutes left in the game Limerick were five points ahead and were coasting to victory. It was then that one of the most explosive All-Ireland final finishes of all-time took place. Offaly were awarded a close-in free which Johnny Dooley stepped up to take. Dooley was told by the management team to take a point; however, he lashed the ball into the Limerick net to reduce the deficit. Following the puck-out Offaly worked the ball upfield and Pat O'Connor struck for a second goal. The Offaly forwards scored another five unanswered points in the time remaining to secure a 3-16 to 2-13 victory. This victory gave Regan a coveted All-Ireland winner’s medal.
In 1995 Offaly retained the Leinster title following a 2-16 to 2-5 trouncing of Kilkenny. It was Regan’s fourth provincial winners’ medal. Down fell to Offaly in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final, allowing Offaly to advance to the championship decider and attempt to defend their title. It was the first ever meeting of these two sides in the history of the championship. The game developed into a close affair with Offaly taking a half-time lead. Four minutes from the end substitute Éamonn Taaffe first timed a long range free straight into the net to give Clare a one-point lead. After a quick equalizer Anthony Daly sent over a 65-metre free to give his team the lead again. Jamesie O'Connor pointed soon afterwards and at the full-time whistle Clare were the 1-13 to 2-8 winners.
In 1996 Offaly surrendered their provincial crown to Wexford. Following this defeat Regan lost his place on the starting fifteen. He made his last appearance as a substitute in a Leinster final trouncing by Kilkenny in 1999 before later retiring from inter-county hurling.

Henry Crawford

Henry Crawford is one of the main characters in Jane Austen's 1814 novel, Mansfield Park. He is depicted as a man who endeavours always to amuse himself, and at the end is proven to be a reprobate.
First Arrival to Mansfield Park.
Henry Crawford comes to Mansfield Park with his sister, Mary Crawford to stay with their half-sister, the wife of the local clergyman. They both are wealthy and extravagant, with elegant London airs. Henry has an estate worth about £4,000 a year, and his sister Mary has £20,000, which now is equivalent to about £2,000,000. When he first comes Mansfield Park, he is seen as a suitable match for Julia, the younger of the two daughters of the wealthy Bertram family, the elder being Maria Bertram. However, both sisters are attracted to him despite Maria's engagement to their neighbour, the wealthy but unintelligent Mr Rushworth. Henry initially flirts with Julia, the younger one, but gradually gives his full attention to Maria. This causes dissension between the sisters. While Henry temporarily returns to his estate in Norfolk, Maria marries Mr. Rushworth, because she believes that Henry does not love her and she wants to leave her family home because she feels stifled there.
Henry and Fanny.
When Henry returns to Mansfield Park, he decides to amuse himself by making Fanny Price, the poor cousin of the Bertrams, fall in love with him. However, because of Fanny's sweet conduct and forbearance, Henry gradually falls genuinely in love with her. To try to make himself seem better in her eyes, he intercedes with his uncle, an admiral, to use his influence in the Royal Navy to obtain a promotion for Fanny's brother William from midshipman to lieutenant. He then proposes to Fanny, but to his surprise, she refuses him, because she is secretly in love with her cousin Edmund Bertram and she believes Crawford to be improper in his conduct with Maria Bertram, such that he would not be a serious and constant lover. Fanny's uncle, Sir Thomas, is very displeased and demands that she marry Crawford as he believes this to be a most advantageous marriage for her. Fanny remains resolutely opposed to the marriage, although her uncle reproaches her very severely. However, Henry is not discouraged. He continues to solicit her love. Sir Thomas Bertram decides to send Fanny back to her own family who live in relatively poor circumstances in Portsmouth, so that she might see how marriage to Crawford would be a better option. While she is there, Henry visits her and proves that he is more constant than she believed as well as demonstrating his acceptance of her family's state.
Henry with Maria.
Henry returns to London where he meets the now married Maria and, piqued by her haughty welcome to her former lover, renews his attentions. Their adulterous affair is uncovered, and the two elope, bringing shame and disgrace on her and irrevocably destroying any good impression he had made with Fanny during his courtship. At the end of the book, the narrator speculates that if Henry had been more patient, Fanny would most likely have accepted him, for Fanny's lover, her cousin Edmund Bertram, would have married Mary if she had not attempted to justify her brother's scandalous affair with Maria.

Cabin Creek Ranger Residence and Dormitory

The Cabin Creek Ranger Residence and Dormitory, also known as the Cabin Creek Ranger Station, were built in 1934 and 1935 in Sequoia National Park by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The three-room wood-frame residence and the two-room dormitory are examples of the National Park Service Rustic style.
The two buildings stand close to the former site of the Lost Grove Entrance Station. They were built by CCC workers from the Buckeye CCC camp during the summers of 1934 and 1935, to house rangers for the Lost Grove entrance to the Generals Highway. Originally intended to be located at Lost Grove and to use sequoia logs, the move to nearby Cabin Creek resulted in a change to a wood appropriate to the new location, which did not feature sequoias. Design work for the buildings was carried out by Park Service landscape architect Harold G, Fowler and Emergency Conservation Work landscape architect Lloyd Fletcher.

<doc id="20602118" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20602118" title="Eve Hill">
Eve Hill

Eve Hill is a residential area of Dudley in the West Midlands of England. It was part of Worcestershire until 1966 and briefly part of Staffordshire until 1974.
History.
The development of Eve Hill as a residential area began in the mid-19th century, as the population of Dudley was soaring as a result of the Industrial Revolution. Hundreds of houses were built in the area around Salop Street which formed part of the main road leading to Sedgley and eventually Wolverhampton. St James's Parish Church was opened at this time to serve Eve Hill and the surrounding area. A new infants school, St James's, was opened on the corner of Salop Street and Himley Road in 1842. 
Dudley Teacher Training College (later absorbed into the University of Wolverhampton) opened off Salop Street in 1905.
Further development took place in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, with a mix of private and council housing being built on the land stretching towards the Priory Estate that was developed before the Second World War.
The original part of Eve Hill, however, was still standing by the start of the 1960s, and by this stage most of the houses in the area were in an unfit condition with outdoor toilets, tin baths, and no electricity or running water. Dudley council decided to demolish the bulk of the older houses around Eve Hill in 1962, and by the end of the decade the landscape had altered drastically. The older houses had been levelled, with many families being rehoused on new council estates like Russells Hall, and the site had been redeveloped with three multi-storey blocks of council flats - Millfield Court, Prince of Wales Court, and Butterfield Court - being occupied by 1969. These tower blocks were 21, 19 and 16 storeys high respectively. A shopping parade including a butcher's shop and a Post Office were built in the shadow of Millfield Court. 
However, the tower blocks soon fell into disrepair and were blighted by crime, and refurbishment and concierge programmes in the late 1980s and early 1990s did little to solve these problems. In March 1998, the council decided to demolish the two tallest tower blocks while retaining the third, and by the following April all of the 170 residents in the condemned tower blocks had been rehoused. The tower blocks were flattened in a controlled explosion on 18 July 1999, by which time the remaining block had been refurbished. 
Meanwhile, University of Wolverhampton sold the old Teacher Training College and the 1960s extensions on the completion of a new campus in Wolverhampton city centre in 2002. The modern buildings were taken over by Dudley College, while the old Teacher Training College was demolished and redeveloped as a private housing estate.
Shaver's End Water Works opened on Highland Road at Eve Hill in 1926.
Bishop Milner Catholic College opened on Burton Road in 1960 and remains in existence today, although most of it was rebuilt during the early-to-mid 2000s (decade).
The Eve Hill area effectively expanded in 1966 when Sedgley Urban district was absorbed into Dudley in 1966 and the borders of Dudley as a town were extended approximately one mile north-west. This area included Burton Road Hospital, parts of which dated back to an 1859 workhouse and had only become a hospital in about 1900. This hospital remained opened until December 1993 and it was demolished within a year, and since its demolition the site has been extensively developed for upmarket private housing. An ambulance station was also opened next to the hospital a few years before its closure, while since its closure a new fire station (replacing the building on Tower Street in the town centre) opened in the old hospital grounds in 1998.

Kevin Kinahan

Kevin Kinahan (born 1971) is an Irish retired hurler who played as a full-back for the Offaly senior hurling team. 
Regarded as one of Offaly's greatest-ever full-backs, Kinahan made his first appearance for the team during the 1991-92 National League and subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 2001 championship. During that time he won two All-Ireland medals, two Leinster medals and three All-Star awards. Kinahan was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions.
At club level Kinahan is a three-time county club championship medalist with Seir Kieran.
Playing career.
Club.
Kinahan played his club hurling with the Seir Kieran club and enjoyed much success.
Having ended up on the losing side in a number of county finals, Seir Kieran reached the championship decider once again in 1995. St. Rynagh's provided the opposition on that occasion. After a 1-13 apiece draw, Seir Kieran went on to win the replay. It was Kinahan's first championship medal.
Both Seir Kieran and St. Rynagh's met again in the 1996 championship decider and, once again, the game was a close affair. Kinahan's side were two points in arrears with two minutes to go, however, Seir Kieran battled back to win by 0-13 to 1-8. It was a second championship medal for Kinahan.
Three-in-a-row proved beyond Seir Kieran, however, the club qualified for a fifth successive championship decider in 1998. Once again St. Rynagh's provided the opposition, however, a draw was the result on that occasion. Seir Kieran went on to win the replay by 1-11 to 0-6, giving Kinahan a third championship medal in four seasons.
Inter-county.
Kinahan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Offaly under-21 hurling team. He won a Leinster medal in this grade in 1991 following a 2-10 to 0-12 defeat of Kilkenny. Offaly later reached the All-Ireland decider with Galway providing the opposition. A 2-17 to 1-9 trouncing was the result for Kinahan's side on that occasion.
Offaly retained their provincial title in 1992, with Kinahan winning a second Leinster under-21 medal following a 1-15 to 2-10 defeat of Kilkenny. Once again Offaly reached the All-Ireland final, this time with Waterford providing the opposition. A 4-4 to 0-16 draw was the result on that occasion, however, Waterford were more effective in the replay. A 0-12 to 2-3 score line resulted in a second All-Ireland defeat for Kinahan.
Kinahan made his senior debut for Offaly in a National Hurling League game against Tipperary in 1992. He was a regular during the next few National League campaigns but was an unused substitute during the championship.
In 1994 Kinahan made his championship debut for Offaly in a provincial semi-final against Kilkenny. He later lined out in his first provincial decider. A 1-18 to 0-14 defeat of Wexford gave Kinahan his first Leinster medal. After defeating Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final, he later lined out against Limerick in the All-Ireland final. With five minutes left in the game Limerick were five points ahead and were coasting to victory. It was then that one of the most explosive All-Ireland final finishes of all-time took place. Offaly were awarded a close-in free which Johnny Dooley stepped up to take. Dooley was told by the management team to take a point; however, he lashed the ball into the Limerick net to reduce the deficit. Following the puck-out Offaly worked the ball up the field and Pat O'Connor struck for a second goal. The Offaly forwards scored another five unanswered points in the time remaining to secure a 3-16 to 2-13 victory. This sensational victory gave Kinahan a second All-Ireland medal. He finished off the year by collecting his first All-Star award.
Offaly retained the Leinster title following a 2-16 to 2-5 trouncing of Kilkenny in 1995. It was Kinahan's second provincial medal. Down fell to Offaly in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final, allowing Offaly to advance to the championship decider and attempt to put back-to-back All-Ireland titles together for the first time ever. It was the first-ever meeting of Offaly and Clare in the history of the championship. The game developed into a close affair with Offaly taking a half-time lead. Four minutes from the end substitute Éamonn Taaffe first timed a long range free straight into the net to give Clare a one-point lead. After a quick equaliser Anthony Daly sent over a 65-metre free to give his team the lead again. Jamesie O'Connor pointed soon afterwards and at the full-time whistle Clare were the 1-13 to 2-8 winners. In spite of this defeat Kinahan later collected a second All-Star award.
After a couple of seasons in the doldrums Offaly emerged again in 1998, however, the year was not without controversy. That year Kinahan's side reached the Leinster final but lost by five points to Kilkenny. This defeat prompted their manager, Babs Keating, to describe the Offaly hurlers as "sheep in a heap", and he promptly resigned. It looked as if Offaly's championship hopes were in disarray, however, they overcame Antrim in the All-Ireland quarter-final and qualified to meet Clare in the semi-final. That game ended in a draw 1-13 apiece draw and had to be replayed. The replay, however, was ended early because of a time-keeping error by the referee Jimmy Cooney. Following a protest on the pitch of Croke Park by the Offaly supporters it was decided that Clare and Offaly would meet for a third time. Kinahan's side won the third game and qualified to play Kilkenny in the final in a repeat of the provincial decider. On that day Brian Whelahan delivered one of his greatest performances. Despite suffering from flu, he started in defence and was later moved to full-forward where he scored 1-6. Offaly reversed the Leinster final defeat by winning the All-Ireland final by six points. Kinahan secured a second All-Ireland medal before later winning a third All-Star award.
Offaly surrendered their championship crown the following year but returned to the All-Ireland decider again in 2000 in a repeat of the Leinster final. Kilkenny's D.J. Carey capitalised on an Offaly mistake after just six minutes to start a goal-fest for "the Cats". Carey scored 2–4 in all, sharing his second goal with Henry Shefflin who also scored a goal in the second-half. At the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the champions by 5–15 to 1–14.
Kinahan retired from inter-county hurling in January 2002.
Inter-provincial.
Kinahan also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial series of games.

Pacific Affairs

Pacific Affairs ("PA") is a peer-reviewed scholarly journal that publishes academic research on contemporary political, economic, and social issues in Asia and the Pacific. The journal was founded in 1926 as the newsletter for the entirety of the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR). In May 1928, "PA" adopted its current name, and has been published continuously since. From 1934 to 1942, the journal was edited by Owen Lattimore, the pioneering scholar of Central Asian history, then William L. Holland.
The journal moved from the IPR headquarters in New York to the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, in 1961. Pressure from Senator Joseph McCarthy led to the dissolution of the IPR in 1960. It is currently housed in the Institute of Asian Research at the University of British Columbia.
The journal's executive committee is composed of an editor, associate editors (based on the following geographic regions: Asia General, China and Inner Asia, Japan, Korea, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australasia and the Pacific Islands) and members representing Simon Fraser University University of Victoria [http://www.uvic.ca, University of Northern British Columbia and the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada [http://www.asiapacific.ca.
Ingenta is the electronic provider for "Pacific Affairs"′ online subscriptions. Subscribers also have access to the entire contents of the journal from its inception in 1926 in JSTOR with a four-year moving wall.
In addition to scholarly articles based on original research, the journal publishes "perspectives," which are shorter articles, and often groups articles with a common theme into special issues. Some recent themes include democratization and communication in Asia, contemporary Japan-North Korea relations, and East Asian cross-regional agreements.
Book reviews.
"PA" publishes 40–50 book reviews in each issue, under the headings of Asia General; China and Inner Asia; Northeast Asia; South Asia; Southeast Asia; and Australasia and the Pacific Region. Books from social sciences and humanities disciplines are reviewed by reviewers who are invited by PA’s executive committee. "PA" also publishes review articles which are also invited by the executive committee members. A review article is more in-depth, longer and compares the conclusions of several different authors on a single topic. The journal does not accept unsolicited book reviews. 
In terms of chronological coverage, books that deal with topics before the 1860s are not reviewed unless there are explicit thematic or analytical links to contemporary affairs and/or theory.

Residence halls at the University of San Francisco

This section gives an overview of each of the residence halls at the University of San Francisco. It provides a description, photographs and history of both on campus residence halls for freshmen and sophomore students and independent living options for upperclassmen.
Residence Hall Amenities.
Each residence hall, or dormitory contains at least one lounge, a kitchen, and laundry facilities. Halls are secured with a 24-hour desk staff. Community programs and activities are planned by Resident Advisors, Resident Ministers, Residence Hall Council, and Residence Hall Association.
Fromm Hall (FR).
Located next to Gleeson Library and St. Ignatius Church, Fromm Hall was formerly known as Xavier Hall, after Saint Francis Xavier. Fromm Hall was later renamed after university benefactors Alfred and Hanna Fromm on October 24, 2003. Fromm Hall is the University of San Francisco’s only all-female residence hall, providing housing for 175 freshmen and sophomore women.|Fromm is also home to Fromm Institute for Lifelong Learning, parish offices of St. Ignatius Church, XARTS (the fine arts program's facility, located in the building's old garage), and the Women's Initiative for Resources, Education, and Development (W.I.R.E.D.).
Gillson Hall (GI).
Gillson Hall, constructed in 1965, is a freshmen residence hall. 
Gillson is named after University benefactor George Gillson who provided funding for the hall. 
Gillson provides housing for 325 first year students and as a hall it is co-ed, alternating between men and women’s floors. 
The ground floor of Gillson Hall contains the offices of the Counseling and Psychological Services.
Hayes-Healy Hall (HH).
Adjacent to the baseball field on Main Campus, Hayes-Healy Hall is situated next to Memorial Gym, Ulrich Field, and Gillson Hall. Built in 1966, the hall was named by John Healy and Ramona Hayes-Healy in honor of their parents, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Hayes and Mr. and Mrs. Richard Healy. Originally housing only women, it now is a co-ed residence hall for 350 first year students with men and women housed on alternating floors. Currently, The Martín-Baró Scholars is the only Living-Learning community housed in Hayes-Healy. The Martín-Baró Scholars focuses on social justice and diversity. Freshman students of The Garden Project, a Living-Learning Community which maintained the campus community garden and focused on sustainable living, also lived in Hayes-Healy until the fall semester of 2011 when The Garden Project was replaced with an Urban Agriculture minor. The building also recently began composting as a part of the composting pilot program in residence halls.
Lone Mountain (LMN).
During the 19th century the land now known as Lone Mountain was a cemetery. In 1900 San Francisco city supervisors outlawed any more burials within the city limits. The land then housed Lone Mountain College, which was eventually purchased by the University of San Francisco. Lone Mountain is located one block north of the main campus. This co-ed hall houses 180 students, primarily sophomores and juniors who occupy both single and double dorms and double-room dorms. Lone Mountain houses the Global Living Community. The building also includes University offices of the University President and Vice-President, several classrooms, and Outtakes Quick Cuisine, which offers cafeteria-style food for residents and students.
Pedro Arrupe Hall (PA).
Originally a nurses' residence for the old French Hospital, USF acquired and renovated the building in 2000; however, because of the building's historical nature the rooms are all different layouts and are significantly smaller than the rooms of other residence halls. Named for Pedro Arrupe, S. J., former Superior General of the Society of Jesus, it is located 12 blocks west of campus. It houses just under 100 upper-division and graduate students. The facilities at this residence hall make it possible for students to live independently of the university by providing a kitchen, computers, a laundry room, and vending machines.[http://www.usfca.edu/residence_life/oncampus/ARRUPE.html]
Phelan Hall (PH).
Named after USF alumnus James D. Phelan, former U.S. Senator from California and mayor of San Francisco, Phelan hall is USF's oldest and largest residence hall. Initially housing 386 students, it now provides housing for 450 first and second year students. The centrally located building also houses the school radio stations, KDNZ (880 AM) and KUSF (defunct) (90.3 FM), the University bookstore, the San Francisco Foghorn, the Office of Residence Life, and the University Ministry Office.
Independent living/Upper-division housing.
Upper-Division student housing at USF offers almost all the same amenities that come with living on-campus in an off-campus setting. These include access to kitchens, Resident Advisors, laundry machines, high-speed internet, telephones, and lounges.
Fulton House.
Acquired by the University in the 1970s initially to house international students, Fulton house is located behind Phelan hall on the perimeter of campus. It consists of two separate buildings, providing a “home” living environment for 12 upper-division students. The large house accommodates nine students including one Resident Advisor. It has three double rooms, two single rooms, and 2 bathrooms, all of which are furnished. They share a full kitchen, a furnished living room and small dining room.
Fulton House Cottage.
The smaller house, known as “the Cottage,” is located adjacent to the larger house. It houses three residents who live in one double room and one single room. It includes a full bathroom, a kitchenette, and a furnished living room.
Loyola Village (LV).
Built in 2002, this condominium-style residential complex of 136 units houses faculty, staff, and students. This complex is located behind Lone Mountain, facing Anza street, on the edge of the USF campus. Most of the rooms in Loyola Village are double occupancy, but other apartments can vary in size from studio to 3-bedroom 3-bathroom floor plan. The village also includes "Town Houses" for graduate and non-traditional age undergraduate students.
Architecturally, this building was made with double padded walls to reduce sounds from unit to unit. It was also built with a garage so that its residents may have a parking facility for their cars for monthly fee.

Simon Whelehan

Simon Whelehan (born 27 July 1976) is an Irish hurler who played as a full-back for the Offaly senior hurling team. 
Whelehan made his first appearance for the team during the 1998 championship and subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 2004 championship. During that time he won one All-Ireland medal. Whelehan was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion.
At club level Whelehan is a three-time All-Ireland medalist with Birr. In addition to this he has also won five Leinster medals and ten county club championship medals.
Whelehan's father, Pad Joe, and his brothers, Brian and Barry, also played hurling with Offaly.
Playing career.
Club.
Whelehan plays his club hurling with Birr and has enjoyed much success during a lengthy career.
By 1997 Whelehan was a regular member of the starting fifteen. That year he won his first county championship medal following a 0-14 to 2-4 defeat of Seir Kieran. He later added a Leinster medal to his collection following an 0-11 to 0-5 defeat of Castletown. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Birr take on Sarsfield's of Galway. Darren Hanniffy scored the only goal of the game after just five minutes and gave Birr a lead that they would never surrender. A 1-13 to 0-9 victory gave Whelehan his first All-Ireland medal.
After surrendering their titles the following year, Birr bounced back in 1999. A 3-15 to 1-11 defeat of St. Rynagh's gave Whelehan a second championship medal. A subsequent 1-16 to 0-11 defeat of Castletown gave Whelehan a second Leinster medal.
Whelehan won further championship medals in 2000 and 2001 as Birr retained their status as the kingpins of Offaly hurling. Once again Birr defeated Castletown in the provincial decider to gave Whelehan his third Leinster medal. Once again Birr qualified for the All-Ireland final with Clarinbridge providing the opposition. A Declan Pilkington goal inside sixty seconds was the perfect start, although the Westerners did recover to lead by 1-4 to 1 -2 at the break. With wind advantage, Birr took control and secured a 2-10 to 1-5 victory. It was Whelehan's second All-Ireland medal, his first as captain.
Birr continued their dominance in 2002 with Whelehan winning a fifth championship medal following a 3-12 to 2-7 defeat of Kilcormac-Killoughey. He later added a fourth Leinster medal to his collection following a 2-5 to 1-2 defeat of Young Irelands in deplorable conditions. Birr later faced Dunloy in the All-Ireland decider. At the third time of asking Birr finally retained the title with a 1-19 to 0-11 victory. It was Whelehan's third All-Ireland medal.
In 2003 Birr defeated Ballyskenach by 1-18 to 1-11 to secure their fifth successive county championship. It was Whelehan's sixth championship medal.
A record six-in-a-row proved beyond Birr, however, Whelehan won his seventh championship medal in 2005 as his side trounced Coolderry by 0-20 to 0-5. 
It was the start of another great run of success for Birr as the club retained their titles in 2006 and 2007. Later that year Whelehan won his fifth and final Leinster medal as Birr narrowly defeated Ballyboden St. Enda's by 1-11 to 0-13. Birr later had the chance to make history by becoming the first club side to win five All-Ireland titles, however, Portumna easily defeated Whelehan's side by 3-19 to 3-9 in the decider. 
In 2008 Whelehan won a remarkable tenth championship medal as Birr defeated Kinnitty by 1-15 to 0-15. It was a fourth successive county title for Birr.
Inter-county.
Whelehan made his senior debut for Offaly in a Leinster championship game against Meath in 1998. He played no part in Offaly's subsequent provincial final defeat by Kilkenny. This defeat prompted the Offaly manager, Babs Keating, to describe the team as "sheep in a heap", and he promptly resigned. It looked as if Offaly's championship hopes were in disarray, however, they overcame Antrim in the All-Ireland quarter-final and qualified to meet Clare in the semi-final. The first game ended in a draw and had to be replayed, however, the replay was ended early because of a time-keeping error by the referee Jimmy Cooney. Following a protest on the pitch of Croke Park by the Offaly supporters it was decided that Clare and Offaly would meet for a third time. Whelehan's side won the third game and qualified to play Kilkenny in the final. On that day Brian Whelehan delivered one of his greatest-ever Offaly performances, scoring 1-6. Offaly reversed the Leinster final defeat by winning the All-Ireland final by 2-13 to 1-16. It was Whelehan's first All-Ireland medal.
Offaly surrendered their All-Ireland crown the following year but returned to the All-Ireland decider again in 2000 in a repeat of the Leinster final. Kilkenny's D.J. Carey capitalised on an Offaly mistake after just six minutes to start a goal-fest for "the Cats". Carey scored 2–4 in all, sharing his second goal with Henry Shefflin who also scored a goal in the second-half. At the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the champions by 5–15 to 1–14.
The following few seasons proved difficult as Kilkenny went on to dominate the provincial championship. Whelehan decided to retire from inter-county hurling after the 2004 championship.
Inter-provincial.
Whelehan also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial series of games. He won a Railway Cup medal in 1998 as Leinster narrowly defeated Connacht by 0-16 to 2-9.

Atmatusti

Atmatusti is translated into English as being “what is pleasing to oneself”. Other scholars have also used different terms to describe atmatusti. For example, Derrett’s translation from French to English of Lingat’s ‘‘The Classical Law of India’’ has coined the term “inner contentment” in reference to atmatusti. Lingat states that inner contentment can be best understood as "the approval of one's conscious". Only Manu and Yājñavalkya refer to atmatusti as the fourth source of dharma within the Hindu Law tradition. Scholars reject atmatusti as a fourth source of dharma because of this. Textual accounts of Manu's and Yajnavalkya's placement of atmatusti as a fourth source of dharma can be found in The Law Code of Manu 2.6 and The Law Code of Yajnavalkya 1.7. Also, atmatusti does not share the same authority as sruti, smriti, and acara. Atmatusti differs significantly from the other three sources of dharma in that it is not based on an "authority exterior to man"; in other words, an individual is able to create their own authority for any issue not covered under sruti, smriti, and acara. The first three sources of law are rooted in the vedas whereas atmatusti is not. It is because of this that atmatusti, as a fourth source, is not recognized by most scholars due to the lack of legitimacy. 
Textual Accounts.
There are only two instances where Atmatusti is designated as a fourth source of dharma within the dharmasastras. 
The first instance comes from The Law Code of Manu or Manava Dharmasastra (MDh). The Laws of Manu are commentaries on the dharmasastras by a sage named Manu and therefore is considered apart of smriti. Because of this, The Law Code of Manu has a great amount of authority. However, Manu’s view of Atmatusti as a fourth source of dharma seemingly was not shared universally with other sages; except a sage named Yajnavalkya. This is understood through the lack of other smriti texts or dharmasastra commentaries in which Atmatusti is designated as a fourth source. Manu lists atmatusti along with sruti, smriti, and acara as being “the four visible marks of the law”. Manu's use of the phrase "the four visible marks of law", however, is not explained in relation to atmatusti legitimately being a fourth source of dharma. The significance here is therefore based interpretation. The first textual account of Atmatusti being listed as a fourth source of dharma is as follows:
The second instance comes from The Law Code of Yajnavalkya (YDh). Here Yajnavalkya, in addition to listing Atmatusti as a fourth source, also lists a fifth source of dharma: "the desire born of proper intention". However, Yajnavalkya is the only person to list this fifth source; therefore, its recognition among scholars is almost non-existent. The lack of support within the dharmasastras as a whole shows that the Hindu community, for the most part, did not find Yajnavalkya's fifth source of dharma correctly listed or legitimate. The second textual account of Atmatusti being listed as a fourth source of dharma along with the listing of a fifth source is as follows:
Role of Atmatusti within Hindu Law.
The appointment of atmatusti as a fourth source can be understood by looking at the hierarchy of the sources. The authority of each source is outlined along with the authoritative relationship the sources have on one another. Sruti, the first source, is superior and has more authority than Smriti and Acara. Smriti, the second source, in turn has authority over Acara, the third source. This is understandable in that the vedic texts are superior to tradition. Hence, it is only when the vedic texts do not provide the necessary dharma needed; will tradition or the secondary vedic texts be sought out. And, only when tradition does not provide the dharma on a specific topic should customary laws be looked into. Therefore, Manu appoints atmatusti as a last resort and fourth source of dharma for instances where the vedas, tradition, and customs all do not provide the necessary dharma or law.
Atmatusti creates a guide in which a person does not obey laws because it's what they were told to do, but because the person has reverence for the law. It can be used to do what is a right in the context of legal manners, but it is generally not viewed as a moral compass that believers should follow. However, the legal aims of atmatusti are usually consistent with the Veda, seeing as the person's inner-self is partly built on by the individual's education. Therefore, the atmatusti is closely connected with a more highly acknowledged source of dharma.
Mimamsa vs. Atmatusti.
“When the Mimamsa method came to be applied to the texts of the smrti it left very little room for atmatusti. ( 1973:6)”.

The co-founders have stated that they believe they can change the world by changing management, and that the way to change it is one manager at a time. After starting with the weekly free podcasts, both hosts completely dedicated their work time, and became co-founders of Manager Tools LLC, a management consulting firm.

Podcasts.
Most casts are about 30–40 minutes long, presented as a dialogue between the two hosts. They cover a specific topic related to management or career development. Casts start with an overview of the points to be discussed, followed by the discussion point by point, and end with a summary of the points discussed.
Manager Tools main podcasts are available on the webpage and also through iTunes and RSS feeds. The podcasts often refer to each other which in the past has created issues with new listeners. In order to help them, a collection of 'basics' casts has been created and is available on their website as well. Those cover mostly 'The Management Trinity' as well as additional basic notions.
Manager Tools casts help "90 percent of the people, 90 percent of the time". And the great majority of the casts are timeless instead of just timely.
Management is about doing the right things repeatedly. Successful managers do them over and over again; and is about Behaviors.
In the Podcast, you find many topics that helps on professional life. Such as: Behaviors (There are 5 Manager Tools behaviors), career, communication, development, network, performance, strategy, team and many more. One of the Manager Tools motto is : "There's a cast for that".
The Manager Tools "Basics" — is a special collection of podcasts on the essentials of effective managerial behavior and the base of all the Manager Tools advanced material.
The podcasts are often articulated around the 'Manager Tools Philosophy'. Its main parts are 'The Management Trinity' and the 'Horstman's Laws'. The founders focus on specific action steps that managers can apply to their job as opposed to theoretical management models.
The hosts also provide for a fee access to special set of podcasts with more specific themes and with more detailed information on those topics . So far there are two themes:
Notable Content and theories.
Foundational Principles - The Management Trinity.
The hosts often refers to the 'Management Trinity': One on Ones, Feedback, and Coaching, plus their silent fourth partner, Delegation. These are at the heart of everything Manager Tools recommends. All Of The Manager Tools Trinity Tools are "Teachable Equivalents" that the hosts have developed. Most casts are based on these tools.
They usually include:
Other foundational principles as described in the 'basics' podcasts include:
DISC - Management adapted to the personality of the direct report.
Manager Tools podcasts often refer to the DISC assessment when adapting management and communication styles to individuals.
The DiSC model provides nonjudgmental language for exploring behavioral issues across four personality traits (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and Conscientious.) These four traits can be grouped in a grid with "D" and "I" sharing the top row and representing extroverted aspects of the personality, and "C" and "S" below representing introverted aspects. "D" and "C" then share the left column and represent task-focused aspects, and "I" and "S" share the right column and represent social aspects. In this matrix, the vertical dimension represents a factor of "Assertive" or "Passive", while the horizontal dimension represents "Open" vs. "Guarded".
Other principles.
There are also some recurring references to other 'rules' or 'laws'. These are mostly referred to verbally in the podcasts:
Activities.
Manager Tools is incorporated under "Manager Tools LLC" and provides multiple services such as :
Licensing.
Some casts are only accessible with a free registration. The site offers Individual Licenses. This is in order to fund the project and keep the podcasts advertisement-free. Both co-founders have had multiple offers for sponsorships, but they’ve turned them all away because the advertising model doesn’t currently fit into their model and brand of building trust.
Forums.
The Manager Tools Forums are built for public discussions between listeners of the podcasts. Here you can read questions asked by other managers and professionals about workplace situations.
Manager Tools employees (including the hosts) regularly intervene to help the members as well.

They have listeners all over the world; since 2009, some of the podcasts and knowledge have been adapted in French and, since 2010, also in German. Those adaptations have been started by enthusiastic listeners of the cast that are willing to invest their time to make the content available to a larger audience (Cedric Watine and his associate Lorry in the French version. Gernot Glawe in the German version).

Burton Road Hospital

Burton Road Hospital was a National Health Service hospital situated in Dudley, West Midlands, England.
It originally existed within the Sedgley Urban district until that became part of Dudley in 1966. However, when the site was first developed in 1859 it was known as Dudley Union Workhouse.
The workhouse closed around the turn of the 20th century and were converted into a hospital which incorporated several new buildings, including the Rosemary Ednam Maternity Home that opened in 1926. The maternity home remained open until May 1988 when all of the borough's maternity services were relocated to a new £6million unit at Wordsley Hospital. [http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~peter/workhouse/Dudley/Dudley1.jpg&imgrefurl=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~peter/workhouse/Dudley/&usg=__0mqe4XxLLT4QCpUlMVO5tN4tzCQ=&h=256&w=384&sz=20&hl=en&start=2&um=1&tbnid=L9glIKZuZhnLjM:&tbnh=82&tbnw=123&prev=/images%3Fq%3D%2522Burton%2BRoad%2BHospital%2522%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26sa%3DN]
A donation by the Rotary Club enabled Burton Road Hospital to receive the country's first mobile cardiac unit in 1971.[http://www.dgoh.nhs.uk/home/nhs60.asp]
The hospital closed in December 1993 on the relocation of its services to Russells Hall Hospital and Bushey Fields Hospital, and demolition took place a year later. The former maternity home, which had been empty for six years, was also demolished at this time.
During the later years of its existence, the hospital mainly housed services for elderly patients as well of those with mental illnesses.
The main road entrance to the hospital was the scene of a murder in the early hours of Christmas Day 1988, when 27-year-old Upper Gornal man Gary Batham was fatally stabbed on his way home from a town centre nightclub. In September 1989, 18-year-old Dudley man Trevor Nettleford was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, and his accomplice Carlos Edwards was sentenced to six months imprisonment for manslaughter.
A new ambulance station had opened on part of the hospital site in 1986, and a new fire station was opened on another part of the site in 1999. 
However, the bulk of the hospital site was redeveloped for upmarket private housing in the mid to late 1990s - the developments being known as Earls Keep and Bishops Lodge.

Mark Morrisroe

Mark Morrisroe (January 10, 1959 in Malden, Massachusetts - July 24, 1989 in Jersey City, New Jersey) was a performance artist and photographer. He is known for his performances and photographs, which were germane in the development of the punk scene in Boston in the 70's and the art world boom of the mid to late 80's in NYC. By the year of his death he had 2,000 pieces of work to his name.
Life and career.
Born to a drug-addicted mother, Morrisroe left home and began hustling under the name Mark Dirt at the age of 15. His mother was a tenant of Albert DeSalvo, the Boston Strangler, and Mark often told people he was DeSalvo's illegitimate son. When he was 17 years old, one of his disgruntled clients shot him in the back, leaving him with a bullet lodged next to his spine for the rest of his life. The experience had a profound influence on Morrisroe's art, which often incorporated images of young prostitutes and X-rays of his injured chest. Morrisroe attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where he made friends with several soon-to-be-well-known artists, including Nan Goldin, David Armstrong, Philip-Lorca diCorcia, Stephen Tashjian (aka Tabboo!, with whom he founded the drag duo "Clam Twins" at the famous Pyramid Club in New York), Gail Thacker and Pat Hearn. His boyfriend while he lived in Boston was Johnathan Pierson, who later changed his name to Jack Pierson. He graduated from the Museum School with honors receiving the coveted "5th" Year" Award. While attending, he performed as a drag character of his own creation named Sweet Raspberry and co-founded a zine called "Dirt Magazine" with his friend Lynelle White, distributing it in Boston nightclubs. This zine was composed of fake news and gossip about celebrities, bands and other famous people, mostly from Boston.
His career as a photographer began when he was given a Polaroid Model 195 Land camera. He experimented with unusual development techniques, receiving generous support of supplies, film, and chemicals from the Polaroid Corporation. Within his close circle of friends he soon laid claim to the "invention" of what are called "sandwich" prints—enlargements of double negatives of the same subject mounted on top of one another—which yielded an elaborate pictorial quality, producing a very iconic painterly impression in the final result, which over time Morrisroe learned to use in an increasingly controlled way. Early on, the artist recognized the intrinsic value of prints—irrespective of the medium used to produce them—as pictorial objects that he could manipulate, color, paint, and write on at will. Thus, Morrisroe scrawled comments, biographical notes and dedications on the side of his pictures, which made them very personal pieces of art. His photographs were mostly portraits, and his subjects included lovers, friends, hustlers, and people who visited his apartment. He also often incorporated stills from Super 8 films. There are also a few photographs which incorporate landscapes and external shots.
Morrisroe died on July 24, 1989 from complications of HIV. His ashes are scattered in McMinnville, Oregon on the farm of his last boyfriend, Ramsey McPhillips. His fame has increased steadily since his death. He is considered a member of the "Boston School" and his work is found in many important collections including that of the Whitney and MOCA of Los Angeles. The estate of Mark Morrisroe (Collection Ringier) is currently located at the Fotomuseum Winterthur.
Filmography.
In the time from 1981 to 1984 Morrisroe shot three low-budget movies on Super-8 film: "The Laziest Girl in Town" (1981), "Hello from Bertha" (1983) and "Nymph-O-Maniac" (1984). These films were influenced by directors such as John Waters and Jack Smith.
Exhibitions.
"His work was exhibited by Pat Hearn Gallery from 1985 onward, including solo exhibitions in 1986 and 1988, His photographs have been included in two group shows at Artists Space: Split Vision, in 1985 (curated by Robert Mapplethorpe): and Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing, 1989 (curated by Nan Goldin). After his death, he was the center of the survey exhibition Boston School, ICA Boston 1995 (curated by Lia Gangitono). Solo exhibitions of his work have included Mark Morrisroe, 1959 - 1989, Neue Gesellschaft fur Bildende Kunst, Berlin; My Life: Mark Morrisroe, Polaroids 1977 - 1989, MOCA, Los Angeles (both 1997)"*

Council of Liubech

The Council of Liubech was the first known federal council of the Kievan Rus'. It was held in 1097 between the constantly rivaling regional princes. The council was followed later by another session in Vytechev on August 10, 1100, known as the Council of Vytechev.
The council was initiated by Vladimir II Monomakh, and gathered Sviatopolk II Iziaslavich, Vasilko Rostislavich, David Svyatoslavich, Oleg Svyatoslavich, and other Rus' princes. The goal was to stop the brotherly war, to pacify the people, and to present a unified front against the Polovtsy (Cumans). The result was the division of Kievan Rus' among the princes and letting their families inherit them. This broke a Rota system (lestvichesliy right) that was observed in Kievan Rus' for two centuries.
The principalities were divided as follows:
And the remaining izgoi princes:
This change effectively established a feudal system in Kievan Rus'. It stopped the struggle for Chernigiv, but was not observed perfectly. After the death of Sviatopolk, the citizens of Kiev revolted and summoned Monomakh to the throne. Nevertheless, it allowed other principalities to consolidate their power and develop as powerful regional centers. Most notably Galicia-Volhynia and Vladimir-Suzdal.

<doc id="20602515" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20602515" title="California Municipal Treasurers Association">
California Municipal Treasurers Association

California Municipal Treasurers Association (CMTA) is the professional society of active public treasurers of California counties, cities, and special districts. It sets ethical standards for the treasury profession in state and local government in California.
The treasurer of a public agency is elected by the voting public or are appointed staff. Public treasurers are primarily responsible for managing the revenue and cash flow of the agency. This officer is also responsible for banking, collections of user fees such as utility usage and business licenses, and communicating financial performance and forecasts to the community.
Membership role.
Members are treasurers of municipalities and other local government agencies, whether elected or appointed, having responsibility for collection, receipt, reporting, custody, investment or disbursement of municipal funds. Municipal funding sources are commonly property tax, sales tax, income tax, utility users tax (UUT), transient occupancy tax (hotel occupancy), and user fees such as licensing and permit fees.
Bill Lockyer is the Treasurer of the State of California. There are 480 California cities, 58 California counties about 3,400 Special Districts and School Districts, each with independent fiscal stewardship. Many City Treasurers are elected, and are therefore directly accountable to their constituents; the remainder are appointed either by City Council or City Manager.
Professional standards setting.
CMTA offers a Certified California Municipal Treasurer (CCMT) certification program, launched in 1978. CCMT is a professional post-nominal awarded to a public treasurer who meets standards of education, experience and a stated commitment to a code of ethics. CCMT candidates must meet or exceed requirements in two areas; 50% educational standards and 50% experience and training requirements. Certification is also designed as a guide for municipal treasurers to become valued administrators in local overnment. 
Training and education in municipal treasury.
CMTA has technical and professional committees that deal with issues facing treasurers, their agencies and the public. CMTA also provides web-based technical support resources, educational material, conferences and technical publications for its members. CMTA's annual statewide conferences provide an array of education across many topics and alternate annually between various northern and southern cities. The association conducts workshops to provide training and education on investments, cash management, bond sales, management skills, communications, and legislation. An on-line resource library is also maintained to support municipal treasurers.
Standing Committees
Financial Leadership is furthered by engaging in efforts to assist statewide finance officers to develop the skills and capabilities necessary to enable them to become organizational leaders as well as technical experts. <br>
California investments - Government Code.
The objective of municipal investments is to enhance the economic status of a given agency consistent with the prudent protection of the agency’s investments. Agencies are required to create a publicly reviewed investment policy, prepared in conformance with all pertinent existing laws of the State of California including California Government Code Sections 53600, et seq. This section of California Government Code defines permitted and prohibited investments. California public treasurers must abide within the limits of this code.
Code of Ethics.
The following Code of Ethics, governing the professional conduct of active members of the California Municipal Treasurers Association, sets a standard of conduct in government finance: <br>
1. To protect, preserve and maintain intact cash, investments and other assets placed in trust with the Treasurer on behalf of the residents of the community.<br>
2. To promote principles of good government. To be dedicated to the concepts of effective and efficient local government service being provided by elected and appointed Treasurers. <br>
3. To maintain personal conduct in such a manner as will enhance the stature of the profession and its ability to serve the public. <br>
4. To observe the profession's technical standards and continually strive to improve the Treasurers’ level of competence. <br>
5. To be dedicated to the highest ideals of honor, integrity, and objectivity in all public and professional relationships, and to function within existing legal guidelines. <br>
6. To promote cooperation, good relations, bonds of friendship and mutual understanding among the membership. <br>
7. To encourage the development of clear lines of communication between residents and elected officials, administrative officers and employees. <br>
8. To resist encroachments upon areas of responsibility, as the Treasurer must be free to carry out official duties without interference. <br>
9. To seek no personal advantage or gain as a result of the position occupied, or due to the commission of a questionable act.
2008 financial crisis.
The worldwide credit market crisis on 2008 put states, cities and other bond-issuing government entities in jeopardy. California Treasurer Bill Lockyer and 19 municipal treasurers sought to work together, asking for an emergency Federal Reserve program to restore liquidity and help drive rates lower.

42d Flying Training Squadron

The 42d Flying Training Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit, last assigned to Air Training Command at Columbus AFB, Mississippi, where it was inactivated on December 15, 1991.
The squadron was first activated at Hamilton Field, California in 1941 as the 42d Pursuit Squadron. It deployed to Alaska where it participated in combat during the Aleutian Campaign. It returned to the United States, where it became a training unit and was disbanded in a general reorganization of the Army Air Forces in 1944.
From 1947 to 1949 the squadron was active in the Air Force Reserve as the 42d Fighter Squadron, but was not fully manned or equipped.
The squadron was redesignated the 42d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and activated in 1953 as an air defense unit in the midwestern United States. It flew North American F-86 Sabres until it was inactivated in 1958.
The squadron conducted undergraduate pilot training as the 42d Flying Training Squadron at Columbus Air Force Base from 1990 to 1992.
History.
World War II.
The squadron was activated at Hamilton Field, California as the 42d Pursuit Squadron on 15 January 1941, as one of the three original squadrons of the 54th Pursuit Group. It trained with Curtiss P-36 Hawks and Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, then moved to Everett Army Air Field, and served as a part of the air defense force for the Pacific coast during the first few months of World War II. The squadron was redesignated as a fighter unit in May 1942.
On 12 June 1942, the air echelon of the 42d took its newly assigned Bell P-39 Airacobras to Nome, Alaska, where it served in combat against the Japanese forces that invaded the Aleutian Islands during the summer of 1942.
The air echelon returned to the United States in December 1942 and rejoined the group, which had been assigned to Third Air Force in Louisiana, and became a replacement training unit (RTU) for North American P-51 Mustang pilots. RTUs were oversized units training individual pilots or aircrews. In early May 1943, the 54th Fighter Group began a split operation, with headquarters and the other squadrons of the group relocating to Bartow Army Air Field, Florida, while the 42d was at Hillsborough Army Air Field. However, the Army Air Forces (AAF) was finding that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, were proving less well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit. As a result, in 1944 the squadron was disbanded as the AAF converted to the AAF Base Unit system. The squadron was replaced by the 343d AAF Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit, Fighter).
Cold War.
In the fall of 1947 the 42d Fighter Squadron was reconstituted and activated in the Air Force Reserve at Orchard Place Airport, near Chicago, Illinois. It was not fully manned or equipped and was inactivated in the summer of 1949 when Continental Air Command converted its reserve organizations under the Wing-Base organizational system.
In February 1953 the squadron was renamed the 42d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and activated as part of the 501st Air Defense Group at the same location, now named O'Hare International Airport. At O'Hare it received radar equipped and rocket armed North American F-86 Sabres.
On 18 August 1955, as part of Air Defense Command's Project Arrow, which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars., the squadron moved on paper from O'Hare to Greater Pittsburgh Airport, Pennsylvania, where it assumed the mission, personnel and aircraft of the 71st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, including its radar equipped and rocket armed North American F-86 Sabres. At Pittsburgh was once again assigned to the 54th Fighter Group. The squadron transitioned into data link equipped F-86Ls in the spring of 1957 for interception control through the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment system and flew them until the group and squadron were inactivated in early 1958.
Pilot Training.
The squadron was redesignated the 42d Flying Training Squadron and conducted undergraduate pilot training at Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi from 1990 to 1991.

Toponymy of New Netherland

__NOTOC__
"Nieuw-Nederland", or New Netherland, was the seventeenth century colonial province of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands on northeastern coast of North America. The claimed territory were the lands from the Delmarva Peninsula to southern Cape Cod. Settled areas are now part of the Mid-Atlantic states of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and southwestern Connecticut. There were small outposts in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Its capital, New Amsterdam, was located at the southern tip of the island of Manhattan on the Upper New York Bay. The most developed part of the province roughly corresponds to today's Greater New York Metro Area.
Placenames in most cases had their roots in Dutch and the Algonquian languages, and occasionally the Iroquoian Mohawk. At the time of European settlement it was the territory of the various Native American groups. In many cases the names of the Natives Americans used today were taken from the word for the place they made their villages, or their sagamore. Both the Americans and the New Netherlanders often gave names inspired by the geography or geology of the natural environment and described a shape, location, feature, quality, or phenomenon.
The Lenape population, who had the most frequent contact with the New Netherlanders, were seasonally migrational groups around the New York Bay and along the Lower Hudson who became known collectively as the River Indians. Among them were the Wecquaesgeek and Siwanoy (to the north on the east side of the Hudson River); the Hackensack, Raritan, the Ramapough, and Tappan (to the west); and the Canarsee and Rockaway (on western Long Island).
The Munsee inhabited the Highlands and western Hudson Valley. The Susquehannock, who lived along the Zuyd Rivier, were called the Minquas. The Mohawk, an Iroquois people, inhabited the Albany region, and the valley that now bears the name. The Mahicans, defeated by the Mohawks, retreated to the Housatonic River region soon after the arrival of the Dutch.
The Native Americans used wampum for transcription. The "Swannikens", or "Salt Water People" (as the Europeans were called), used the Latin alphabet to write down the words they heard from the "Wilden" (as the Lenape were called). These approximations were no doubt greatly influenced by Dutch, which was the lingua franca of the multilingual province. Some names still exist in their altered form, their current spelling (and presumably pronunciation) having evolved over the last four centuries into American vernacular.
Early settlers and their descendants often "Batavianized" names for geographical locations, the exonyms, rather than by their autonym, subsequently becoming the name of the Native Americans used today. In some cases it cannot be confirmed, or there is contention, as to whether the roots are in the Dutch or native tongue as sources do not always concur. Some can have several interpretations, while locative suffixes vary depending on the Algonquian language dialect that prevailed. "Kill", meaning "stream" or "channel", "wyck" meaning "district",
(or its English equivalents "wick" and "wich"), and "hook" meaning "point" are often seen.
Dutch surnames abound throughout the region as avenues, lakes, parks. Orange and Nassau come from the "first family" of the Dutch Republic, a dynasty of nobles traditionally elected "Stadtholder." William III of England was also Prince of Orange, succeeding to the English throne through the conquest known as the Glorious Revolution, so the appellation Orange, though sometimes named for the English king in this period, reflects his Dutch birth and dynasty.
List of place names.
"Acquackanonk".
Name of a Unami group who lived along and between the banks of the Passaic Neck and the name of one of state's first townships, established in 1683. Meaning "a place in a rapid stream where fishing is done with a net", Alternatively, "at the lamprey stream" from contemporary "axkwaakahnung". Spellings include "Achquakanonk", "Acquackanonk", "Auchaquackanock","Ackquekenon"
"Achter Col".
Called "Meghgectecock" by the Lenape this described the area around Newark Bay and the rivers that flowed into it. Neither are longer in use. "Achter", meaning behind, and "kol", meaning neck, can be translated as the "back (of the) peninsula", in this case Bergen Neck.
Variations include "Achter Kol", "Achter Kull", "Archer Col", "Achter Kull"
"Amsterdam".
After the Dutch capital, originally a dam on the Amstel River founded in 1275
"Arresick".
A tidal island, site of first ferry landing for the patroonship Pavonia, which became Paulus Hook.
Spellings include "Arresick" and "Arressechhonk" and "Aresick" meaning "burial ground"
"Arthur Kill".
Tidal strait separating Staten Island from the mainland. From "kille" meaning "water channel"such as "riverbed", "rivulet", or "stream" . Likely to have evolved from "Achter Col", the name given by the New Netherlanders for area surrounding Newark Bay and waters that flowed into it, as English language speakers immigrated to the region radiating from the Elizabethtown Tract and Perth Amboy.
"Barnegat".
Originally "Barendegat" or "Inlet of the Breakers" for the waterway's turbulent channel.
"Bedloe's Island".
Now known as Liberty Island, under Dutch sovereignty the island became the property of Isaack Bedloo, merchant and "select burgher" of New Amsterdam, and one of 94 signers of the "Remonstrance of the People of New Netherlands to the Director-General and Council".
"Bergen".
Bergen Square.
The forerunner of Hudson and Bergen counties.
There are various opinions as to the naming of "Bergen". Some say that it so called for Bergen op Zoom in the Netherlands or the city in Norway Others believe it comes from the word "bergen", which in Dutch and other Germanic languages of northern Europe means mountains or hills, and could describe a most distinct geological feature of the region, The Palisades. Yet another interpretation is that it comes from the Dutch verb "bergen", meaning "to save" or "to recover", or noun "place of safety" inspired by the settlers return
after they had fled attacks by the native population during the Peach Tree War.
Bergen Street.
In the contemporary borough of Brooklyn,
Bergen Street was named for the family of one of the earliest settlers of Nieuw Amsterdam, Hans Hansen Bergen, who arrived in the province of New Netherland in 1633 as a ship's carpenter. Hans Hansen Bergen came from Bergen, Norway, and was one of the few Scandinavian settlers of Nieuw Amsterdam (New York City). Bergen initially settled on Pearl Street in Lower Manhattan (Nieuw Amsterdam) but later owned extensive plantations elsewhere on the island.

Alternatively, adjacent to (or opposite) the fort was the terminus of the Great Minquas Path, an 80-mile (130 km) trail from the Susquehanna River to the river. This was the primary trade route for furs from the Susquehannock people, and the Dutch named the trail "Beversreede" or "Beaver Road."

From Dutch name that came into use nearly 150 years before the first Blauvelts came to the New World. The etymology of the name probably comes from the coat of arms adopted by the first Blauvelt, Pieter Blauwveld, a prominent trader in the Netherlands.

"Bowery".
"Bouwerij" was the old Dutch word for farm (contemporary "boerderij").

Alternatively from "Hoebuck", old Dutch for high bluff and likely referring to Castle Point Variations used during the colonial era included "Hobock", "Hobocan","Hoboocken", and "Hobuck", Although the spelling"Hoboken" was used by the English as early as 1668, it doesn't appear that until Col. John Steven purchased the land on which the city is situated that it became common.
Some would believe the city to named after European town of the same name. The Flemish Hoboken, annexed in 1983 to Antwerp, Belgium, is derived from Middle Dutch "Hooghe Buechen" or "Hoge Beuken", meaning "High Beeches" or "Tall Beeches". Established in 1135, the New Netherlanders were likely aware of its existence (and may have pronounced the Lenape to conform a more familiar sound), but it is doubtful that the city on the Hudson is named for it.
"Housatonic".
From the Mohican phrase "usi-a-di-en-uk" translated as "beyond the mountain place".
"Hudson".
The river, county, city and numerous other places that bear this name most likely do so for the English sea captain Henry Hudson who explored the region in 1609, establishing a claim for the Dutch East Indies Company and Dutch Republic.

"Rondout".
A tributary of the Hudson River in Ulster and Sullivan counties "Rondout" comes from the fort, or "redoubt", that was erected near its mouth The Dutch equivalent of the English word "redoubt" (a fort or stronghold), is "reduyt". In the Dutch records of Wildwyck, however, the spelling used to designate this same fort is invariably "Ronduyt" during the earliest period, with the present form "rondout" (often capitalized) appearing as early as 22 November 1666. The Dutch word ronduyt is an adjective meaning "frankly" or "positively." The word could also be broken down into its components and translated, literally, "round-out."

European settlers of the region named it first the Palse River, after New Paltz. Later, when it was clear that the river continued well beyond the original New Paltz patent, it took after the Waal river in their native Netherlands.

Humphrey Bate

Humphrey Bate (May 25, 1875 – June 12, 1936) was an American harmonica player and string band leader. He was the first musician to play old-time music on Nashville-area radio, and is generally regarded as the first performer on what would eventually become the Grand Ole Opry. Bate and his band, which had been given the name "Dr. Humphrey Bate & His Possum Hunters" by Opry founder George D. Hay, remained regulars on the Grand Ole Opry until Bate's death in 1936. The band's recordings, while scant, are considered some of the most distinctive and complex string band compositions in the old-time genre.
Early life.
Humphrey Bate was born in Castalian Springs, Tennessee on May 25, 1875 to a prominent Middle Tennessee family. Several of Bate's relatives had served as Confederate officers in the American Civil War, including a captain— also named Humphrey Bate— who was killed at the Battle of Shiloh. Bate's cousin, William Brimage Bate, served as Governor of Tennessee in the 1880s. The Bate family owned several plantations throughout the southeast, and Humphrey probably learned to play dance tunes from freed slaves living on his father's plantation in Castalian Springs.
Throughout his teen years, Bate collected pocket change by playing harmonica on steamboats travelling up and down the Cumberland River. He eventually attended medical school at Vanderbilt University in Nashville and served as a surgeon in the Spanish American War (1898). While Bate worked primarily as a physician for most of his life, he never lost his passion for playing music. He likely formed his first string band sometime around 1900, and subsequently acquired a reputation in the Nashville area by playing at various rallies and silent movie theaters.
The Opry years, 1925–1936.
In September 1925, Bate and his band became the first musicians to play old-time music on Nashville radio when they performed on the small local station WDAD. A month later, William Craig, a purchasing agent for the National Life and Accident Insurance Company, invited Bate to play on the company's new radio station, WSM, which could reach a much wider audience than WDAD. Bate happily accepted, and over the following weeks, he and his band— which was typically called "Dr. Bate's Band" or some similar variation— played on WDAD in the afternoon and WSM in the evening.
In November 1925, WSM hired announcer George Hay, who had developed a popular program called National Barn Dance for Chicago radio station WLS. Hay kept the barn dance format for WSM, and sought rural musicians from the Nashville area to play on the program. WSM's "Barn Dance" first aired on November 28, 1925 with legendary fiddler Uncle Jimmy Thompson as its first performer. Bate made his first appearance on the program three weeks later. The band was first introduced as "Dr. Humphrey Bate and His Augmented String Orchestra," but Hay eventually changed the name to the more rural-sounding "Dr. Humphrey Bate and His Possum Hunters." 
In 1927, Hay changed the name of WSM's Barn Dance to the "Grand Ole Opry." Over the next several years, Bate— dubbed the "Dean of the Opry" by Hay— performed regularly on the program. Bate's band was unusually large for a string band, typically consisting of two fiddles, two guitars, a banjo, a cello, and a bowed bass. Regular bandmates included guitarists Burt Hutcherson and Staley Walton, fiddlers Oscar Stone and Bill Barrett, banjo player Walter Ligget, and bassist Oscar Albright. Bate's daughter Alcyone Bate Beasley often performed with the band as a ukelele player. The band's set usually opened with the song, "There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight," and the band's repertoire included "Old Joe," "Greenback Dollar," "Going Uptown," and "Eighth of January."
Dr. Humphrey Bate and His Possum Hunters held their only major recording session on March 3, 1928 in Atlanta, when they recorded twelve sides for Brunswick Records. In 1931, the band became the first Opry band to go on tour. Bate was also instrumental in introducing Hay to various Nashville-area musicians, including the Crook Brothers and DeFord Bailey. On June 12, 1936, Bate died of a heart attack at his home in Castalian Springs. The Possum Hunters continued playing with various line-ups (some of which included Bate's son, Humphrey, Jr.) until the 1960s.

Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act

The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act was established in 1956 as part of the Hindu Code Bills. Three other important acts were also created during this time and they include the Hindu Marriage Act (1955), the Hindu Succession Act (1956), and the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act (1956). All of these acts were put forth under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru, and were meant to modernize the then current Hindu legal tradition. The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act of 1956 was meant to enhance the Guardians and Wards Act of 1890, not serve as its replacement. This act specifically serves to define guardianship relationships between adults and minors, as well as between people of all ages and their respective property.
Introduction.
This act is one of four Hindu Code Bills that were codified by the Nehru Administration in 1956. The other three Acts include the Hindu Succession Act, Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, and Hindu Marriage Act. The Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act delineates the policies regarding minorities according to Indian Hindu personal law.
Important definitions.
A. A minor is a person under the age of 18
B. A guardian is the caretaker of a minor, his or her property, or both. Categories of guardians include: a natural guardian; a guardian chosen by the mother or father; a guardian appointed by the court; and a person who qualifies as a guardian according to the Court of Wards.
Extent of Act.
This Act extends to all of India with the exception of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. 
This Act is intended to be an addendum to the Guardians and Wards Act of 1890, not its replacement.
Overriding quality.
Any former law that is inconsistent with this law is declared legally void. This law supersedes all other relevant laws.
Application.
This Act applies to all Hindus, meaning those who belong to the Hindu religion or any of its developmental forms. These include the Lingayat, Virashiva, and those who follow Brahmo, Prarthana or Arya Samaj. Those who practice the religions of Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism are also considered Hindus. Finally, those who are not Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jewish are governed by this Act unless they can prove that prior to its passage, they were not governed by Hindu law. 
Both legitimate and illegitimate minors who have at least one parent that meets the stipulations outlined above fall under the jurisdiction of this Act.
Natural guardians.
The father is the primary guardian for a legitimate boy and unmarried girl and their property, while the mother is the secondary guardian. However, the mother is the primary guardian for all children under the age of five. For illegitimate children, the mother is the primary guardian, while the father is the secondary guardian. A married girl’s husband becomes her guardian. For an adoptive son, the adoptive father is the primary guardian, then the adoptive mother.
Each of these, if they chose, may appoint guardians of their child’s person or property. 
Should a parent cease being a Hindu or become a renouncer, hermit, or ascetic, that parent will lose his or her guardian rights.
Abilities of natural guardians.
Natural guardians can take actions that will benefit and protect the minor and his or her property. However, the guardian cannot sign a personal covenant for the minor. The guardian cannot sell, mortgage or give away any part of the minor’s immovable property, lease this property for more than five years, or lease the property for more than one year after the child becomes eighteen.
Minors and property.
A child cannot act as a guardian of property of minors. 
For a minor who possesses an undivided interest in joint family property that is already controlled by an adult in that family, a guardian shall not be appointed to manage that undivided interest.
Welfare of minor.
The welfare of the minor will be the primary consideration in the appointment of a guardian.

Andy Levitre

Andrew Steven Levitre (; born May 15, 1986) is an American football offensive guard for the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League. He was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the second round, 51st overall in the 2009 NFL Draft. He played college football for the Oregon State Beavers.
Early years.
Levitre prepped at San Lorenzo Valley High School in Felton, California, where he was a two-way lineman. In his junior season, he recorded 47 tackles, two quarterback sacks and two fumble recoveries. He added more than 60 tackles and three sacks in his senior year.
Considered only a two-star recruit by both "Rivals.com" and "Scout.com", Levitre was not ranked among the nation's top offensive line prospects in 2004. He chose Oregon State over LSU, Fresno State, and Arizona, where his older brother, Erick, played offensive center (2002–06).
College career.
Levitre redshirted in 2004, and played in all 11 games as a redshirt-freshman in 2005, while starting vs. Oregon. In his sophomore season, he started in game four of the season after senior starter Josh Linehan injured a knee in game three vs. Idaho. Levitre earned Pac-10 Honorable Mention as a player and academically.
During his junior year, Levitre started every game at either right or left tackle, and earned Pac-10 Conference second team honors as selected by the coaches. For his senior season he was named to the 2008 Outland Trophy watch list, and started all 13 games at left tackle. He registered a career-high 91 knockdowns and 14 touchdown-resulting blocks and was earned All-American status by the American Football Coaches Association and "Pro Football Weekly". He was considered the most-decorated Beaver offensive lineman since John Didion, a consensus All-America choice in the late 1960s.
Professional career.
2009 NFL Draft.
Alongside Duke Robinson and T. J. Lang, Levitre was considered one of the best guards available in the 2009 NFL Draft. He has been compared to Todd Herremans by "The Sporting News", and to Josh Beekman by "CBS Sports".
Buffalo Bills (2009-2012).
Levitre was selected by the Buffalo Bills with the 51st pick overall in the second round of the 2009 NFL Draft, and was the first college guard drafted. He is the sixth selection from Oregon State in Bills history, the first since Keith Ellison in 2006. Counted on to start at left guard, Levitre joined a completely retooled offensive line that was expected to feature two rookie starters—him, and first round pick Eric Wood at right guard—and no players returning at the same position. He started all 16 games in 2009.
On January 15, 2010, Levitre was named to the 2009 NFL All-Rookie team along with teammate Jairus Byrd.
Tennessee Titans (2013-present).
On March 12, 2013 Levitre reached a six year $46.8 million deal with the Tennessee Titans. Levitre underwent arthroscopic knee surgery in January 2013 and still felt knee soreness just days after signing for the team.

Tell Taya

Tell Taya is an archaeological site in Nineveh Province (Iraq). It was occupied from the third to the first millennia BCE.
History of archaeological research.
The site was first recorded by Seton Lloyd in 1938 during his survey of the region. Tell Taya was excavated by a team from the British School of Archaeology in Iraq led by J. E. Reade in 1967–1969 and 1972–1973. Numerous stone structures were investigated, and pottery, along with a few tablets and cylinder seals, were recovered in the 9 layers.
Tell Taya and its environment.
Tell Taya lies about southwest of Mosul and Nineveh. The location controls a formerly rich agricultural area and an important trade route. It covers about and the central mound is around high.
Occupation history.
The site was heavily occupied on and off during the second half of the 3rd millennium, with some re-use in the Old Babylonian period and the Neo-Assyrian period. There is some evidence of Early Dynastic occupation, but major building at Tell Taya began around the time that the Akkadian Empire emerges.

<doc id="20602805" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20602805" title="Western Front Association">
Western Front Association

The Western Front Association (WFA) was inaugurated on 11 November 1980, in order to further interest in The Great War of 1914-1918. The WFA aims to perpetuate the memory, courage and comradeship of all those who fought on all sides and who served their countries during The Great War.
The WFA was established by military historian John Giles, who enlisted the help of John Terraine, who had co-written the landmark television series The Great War, which was first broadcast in 1964. The Western Front Association does not seek to justify or glorify war. It is not a re-enactment society, nor is it commercially motivated. It is entirely non-political. The object of the Association is to educate the public in the history of The Great War with particular reference to the Western Front.
Since its foundation the WFA has grown over the years to in excess of 6,000 members worldwide. There are around 60 branches in the UK, Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The WFA is a UK registered charity, numbered 298365.
Web Site.
The website of the The Western Front Association contains a wealth of articles on The Great War and there is an interactive discussion forum with a wide range of discussion topics, the Front Forum. One of the notable sections of the website is a "For Schools" section which has a large number of educational resources for teachers and young students alike.
Branches.
With nearly sixty branches world-wide, including fifty in the UK and Ireland, the association has a representation in most counties in the UK and in most of 'main combatant' countries which took part in the Great War. Membership of the WFA is not a requisite to attend branch meetings, which are open to the public. As most branches hold an event at least once a month, there are between 500 and 600 meetings up and down the UK every year in which an aspect of the Great War is discussed. The number of branches being formed is increasing, which gives an indication that interest in the First World War is also increasing.
Publications.
The WFA publishes its eminent journal, "Stand To!" three times a year. This contains many learned articles on the subject of The Great War. There is also a house magazine for members, the "Bulletin", which is also published three times each year. An electronic newsletter is also available for members and non-members to subscribe to.
Annual Service of Remembrance.
The WFA organises each year the Remembrance ceremony held at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London on 11 November (not Remembrance Sunday).
Butte de Warlencourt.
The Western Front Association owns a small but historically important part of the "old front line" on the Somme, the Butte de Warlencourt. This land was bought by The Western Front Association in 1990 in order to ensure its future preservation.
A memorial detailing the fighting that took place in the area was dedicated in a ceremony on the Butte on 30 June 1990. The ceremony involved the then President of the WFA, well known historian and author John Terraine.
First World War Records Saved.
Medal Index Cards.
The Medal Index Cards were saved from destruction in 2005. Medal Index Cards (MICs) are the original method of recording medal entitlement for soldiers who served in the Great War.Each soldier who served in an active theatre of operations was awarded a medal.
The Medal Index Cards were stored at the Ministry of Defence record centre in Hayes until 2005. Due to the need to make space, the MoD sold the Hayes site for redevelopment; the MoD (which owned the cards) proposed the cards would be destroyed. No museum or archive was prepared to take them on, so the Western Front Association came forward and agreed to save these records.
Since obtaining these cards, the WFA has been storing them. Many WFA members have requested copies of these, often placing the card in a frame alongside the medals.
Pension Index Cards and Ledgers.
In November 2012, the WFA announced that it has secured over six million Pension Index Cards and Ledgers from the UK's Ministry of Defence, which would otherwise have been destroyed. These are an extremely valuable primary source for family and military historians as they provide information on men (and some women) who served in the Great War and who subsequently applied for a pension. This significantly adds to the data that is available, particularly for those individuals who survived the Great War.
Sound Archives at the Imperial War Museum.
The Imperial War Museum's sound archive holds over 33,000 recordings relating to conflict since 1914. This consists of the largest oral history collection of its type in the world, with contributions from both service personnel and non-combatants as well as significant holdings of speeches, sound effects, broadcasts, poetry and music. The Western Front Association funded digitisation of the majority of IWM's First World War sound recordings, thereby widening public access to this important historical resource.
Tours.
The WFA organises tours of the Battlefields four times a year

Li Jianying

Li Jianying (; - ) was a People's Liberation Army Air Force pilot.
Li chose to sacrifice himself in a crash-landing rather than bail out and leave his plane to plow into a village.
Li was born in Zhengzhou, Henan in 1964. Li was known for his toughness and work ethic. He joined the army in 1982, and served as air force Colonel and first-class pilot before his death. During his 22-year flying career, Li flew 5,003 times registering 2,389 hours of safe flights, and was awarded third-class and second-class honors. Li was posthumously awarded a first-class merit and a gold medal for pilots, the highest honor for a pilot. 
On Nov 14, 2006, Li Jianying was flying over an area populated by 7 villages, 814 households, an express toll station and a tile workshop when his fighter jet ran into a flock of pigeons. There were over 800 liters of aviation oil, more than 120 airborne shells, a rocket, and inflammable oxygen cylinders. Li knew that if he ejected, the jet would went out of control causing unimaginable loss. Li radioed in that he was going to attempt a forced landing. He attempted to set down on a river bank, but his jet exploded on impact. Li died in the crash and was awarded a first-class merit and a gold medal for pilots.
In 2008 Li was tied for first place in "CCTV"'s "China's 10 Most Moving People of 2007" award.

Taping River

Taping River, also known as Ta Hkaw Hka in Kachin and Ta Ying Chiang(大盈江) in Chinese, is a river in northern Myanmar, formerly Burma. It is the first tributary of the country's chief river, the Irrawaddy, and the watersheds between it and the N'mai Hka river to the northwest and the rivers Shweli and Salween to the southeast form part of the boundary with China. Its source lies in Yingjiang County of Yunnan Province,China, and it enters the Irrawaddy near Bhamo, Kachin State.
History.
In 1277 King Narathihapate of Bagan had an embassy from Kublai Khan executed and then invaded the state of Kanngai along the Taping river, 70 miles north of Bhamo, for submitting to the Mongols. The Chinese defeated the Burmese in the Battle of Ngasaunggyan, a vivid account of which was reported back to Europe later by Marco Polo. The Chinese army advanced to Kaungsin but turned back because of excessive heat. They returned however in 1283, destroying Kaungsin and advancing into the Irrawaddy valley culminating in the fall of Bagan.
Trade with China had taken place along the Taping river for centuries through Kaungsin until Bhamo became more important from the 15th Century onwards.
During the Second World War the Allies built the Ledo Road from India to China across northern Burma, and before Christmas 1944, completed 354 miles to reach Myothit on the Taping river in order to link up with the old Burma Road at Bhamo.American GIs in the road gang had pleasant recollections of their time along the river trading with locals for souvenirs and hunting in the jungle. Pontoon bridges were built by engineers across 10 major rivers including the Taping.
Earlier in the war, the Chinese 38th Division led by General Sun Li-Jen under the Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC) had fought the Japanese 56th Division along the Taping in a successful attempt at capturing Myothit in late October and subsequently driving the enemy out of their main defense positions in Bhamo, thus spearheading the drive in the construction of the Ledo Road.

A rhinoceros was shot in 1946 after it had crossed the Irrawaddy and then the Taping river.
The Americans hunted sambar (deer), pheasants, and bear during the war, and a tame pet otter was traded for 2 boxes of matches.
The Irrawaddy dolphin has been known to enter the upper tributaries of the Irrawaddy including the Taping especially when the rivers are flooded. They were observed in the 19th Century up to 30 km above Bhamo called "Dolphin Point". More recent surveys in 2002-2004 reported sightings in the deep pool area at the confluence of the Taping and the Irrawaddy, and up to 36 km upstream to Sinkan at the upstream end of the second defile of the Irrawaddy. Dam building upstream along the Taping is causing concerns as the reduced flow during the dry season could lead to loss of habitat and decline in their numbers.
Development.
Hydropower projects are under way in the region along the Taping, and 3 dams are being built - one on the Chinese side of the border, and 2 in Burma jointly by China Datang Corporation (CDT) and the Burmese military government namely Taping 1, 33 miles from Bhamo (240 MW), and Taping 2, 26 miles from Bhamo (168 MW).

Classical Hindu law

Classical Hindu law is a category of Hindu law (dharma) in traditional Hinduism, taken to begins with the transmittance of the Vedas and ending in 1772 with the adoption of "A Plan for the Administration of Justice in Bengal" by the Bengal government. Law during the classical period was theologically based on the dharmasastra, and dharma which was traditionally delineated by "learned people" or scholars of the Vedas. However, in reality, classical Hindu law was diverse in practice, varying between locations, vocational groups, and castes. Thus, the common source of classical Hindu law was the community and, therefore, laws on a whole were highly decentralized and diverse. These laws were dictated by various corporate groups such as merchant leaders, heads of caste, and kings, and because of the diverse leadership, these laws were particular to a set place. Records of classical Hindu law can be found in the Manu Smriti and other smṛti literature; although, actual court records during this time period are rare. 
Sources.
Classical Hindu law was theologically based on the Dharmasastras. Traditionally these texts established the rules of dharma which could be found through three sources. Theologically the most important source for dharma was from the śruti or Veda because it was acknowledged to be of divine origin. If one could not find a particular idea in the Vedas, the Dharmasutras instructed him or her to consult the next source of authority: smṛti followed then by ācāra and in some cases ātmatuṣṭi.
However, ācāra was the law that was conveyed in actual practice.
Śruti.
Śruti is a section of texts that are learned through hearing and are synonymous with the Vedas. Originally transmitted to ancient Rishis by way of cosmic vibration, the texts are considered the highest form of revelation. Because of their divine origin, the texts were passed orally through the generations by a select group of people who were granted the power to interpret the texts into more tangible laws. Although the texts themselves contain no specific law codes or rules, they are the claimed source for all classical Hindu Laws. These texts contain the four Vedas and the supplementary commentary associated with them.
Smṛti.
Smriti, defined as tradition, is the second source of dharma and specifically refers to the written texts which cite the traditions of lawful virtuous people. These texts include the Dharmasastras. Smriti refers to the collections of acara or customary law wherein learning takes place. Smriti is the testimony of people who know the Vedas and is considered as the secondary Veda. Unlike Sruti, revelation, Smriti is based on memory; specifically those of sages who transmit their memories of traditions onto men as a means of passing down their wisdom. Smriti also represents the complete set of sacred literature: the six Vedangas, the epics (the Mahabharata and the Ramayana) and the Puranas.
Ācāra.
Ācāra is the third source of dharma and refers to the community norms and standards of a particular social group. Traditionally, according to the dharmasastras, these standards are derived from the actions of those so fully learned in the Vedas that all their actions are aligned with Vedic teaching. Such actions are looked towards for example in times when information regarding a particular instance is not found within śruti and smṛti literature. Although theologically the Vedas or śruti literature should be the primary source for information regarding Hindu law, in reality, ācāra provided the basis for the working system of law during the classical period. Along with this shift away from laws directly resulting from the Vedas came the normalization of leaders whose actions are considered ācāra yet are not Vedic scholars. Overtime, merchant leaders, heads of caste, and community leaders became the true sources of ācāra and therefore, also became the primary source for rulings within the Hindu law tradition.
Ātmatuṣṭi.
Atmatusti is defined as being what is pleasing to oneself and is considered by some to be the fourth source of dharma. However, only the law codes of Manu and Yājñavalkya cite atmatusti as the fourth source of law. Most scholars do not recognize atmatusti as a source of dharma within Hindu Law because it does not have the same authority as sruti, smriti, and acara. Atmatusti is used as a last resort where a person may only use it if the first three legitimate sources do not address the issue in question.
Classical Hindu Law in Practice.
Administration.
Classical Hindu law in practice originates from community, not a state polity. In this way, particular groups of society began to gain influence in the creation and administration of law. Primary corporate groups, Kingships, and Brahmins were the factions, which conveyed Hindu jurisprudence in practice. Corporate groups were responsible for legislating law through the conception of social norms; kingships were responsible for the administration of punishment and the worldly Hindu system; and Brahmins were responsible for ritual, penance, and the maintenance of a spiritual Hindu system.
Judicial Procedure.
Evidence of Judicial Procedure in ancient India was mostly derived from classical Hindu law and religious texts like the Vedas. The King was made to be the ultimate law authority within a court. Ordeals the divine methods of proof and Oaths for simple cases were used to help in the decision making process. While ultimately basing the decision from the basis of different texts like Manu, Yājñavalkya,Dharmaśāstras, Sastras and Smrtis.

South Littleton

South Littleton is a village and civil parish located in the Wychavon district of Worcestershire, England.
South Littleton is located midway between Evesham and Bidford on Avon. South Littleton is the largest of The Littletons, with North and Middle Littleton being smaller. At the 2001 census it had 1,775 inhabitants, while North and Middle Littleton had a population of 906. 
History.
Though Neolithic human activity has been documented in the area, it is thought the first permanent settlements were constructed during Romano-British times (the important Roman road of Ryknild Street runs by the area). Other nearby Romano-British at Ullington, Blakes Hill and Littleton Pastures have been documented, and all were thought to be in continuous occupation until the late 4th century. Archeological evidence suggests the area was completely abandoned after the end of the Roman occupation of Britain. 
The area had been repopulated to an extent by the time of the Domesday Book, which documents the Littletons twice. Later stone buildings remain in the villages today. The parish remained largely as an agricultural area until the late 1940s. Today, very few of the inhabitants of the parish are employed in agriculture.
South Littleton today.
The village is served by South Littleton Parish Council. The Littletons First School is in South Littleton which also has a large Recreation Ground. There are also allotments and Bowling and Tennis Clubs. There is a shop & Post office and a Fish & Chip Shop located on the village High Street. There is also a Church of England church and a Quaker Chapel located in the village.
South Littleton is also the location of HMP Long Lartin, a maximum security prison for adult males.

<doc id="20602969" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20602969" title="Ananda yoga">
Ananda yoga

Ananda Yoga, or "Ananda Yoga for Higher Awareness" is a system of Hatha Yoga established by Kriyananda, a disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda, and is based on his Kriya Yoga teachings. Ananda Yoga emphasizes inner awareness; energy control; and the experience of each asana as a natural expression of a higher state of consciousness, which is enhanced by the use of affirmations.
History.
Ananda Yoga was established from one of the oldest Hatha Yoga systems in the West. Its roots are the 1940/1950ies, when Kriyananda was asked by Yogananda, founder of Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF), to demonstrate the postures for visiting guests, as well as for public events, such as the SRF "Lake Shrine Dedication." Kriyananda also modeled for photos, for articles on the yoga postures in Yogananda's "Self-Realization Magazine." From 1965 he started to teach Ananda Yoga publicly in California. In 1972 his students developed a Yoga Teacher Training Program, which is now taught in America, in Europe, and in India. The director of Ananda Yoga, Gyandev Rich McCord, is a co-founder of Yoga Alliance and a member of its Board of Directors.
Principles.
Ananda Yoga uses asana and pranayama to awaken, experience, and control the subtle energies (prana) within oneself, especially the energies of the chakras. Its object is to use those energies to harmonize the body, uplift the mind, and above all to attune oneself with higher levels of awareness. One unique feature of this system is the use of silent affirmations while in the asanas, as a means of working more consciously with the subtle energies to achieve this attunement. Ananda Yoga is a relatively inward experience, not an athletic practice. A main goal is to prepare for deep meditation, as Hatha Yoga is considered the physical branch of Raja Yoga.
Ananda Yoga also includes Paramahansa Yogananda's Energization Exercises, which direct cosmic life force (prana) through the medulla oblongata to all parts of the body.
Energization exercises.
The "Energization Exercises", a vital part of Ananda Yoga, are Yogananda's contribution to the science of yoga. He first developed them in 1916, within his organization then called "Yogoda," which he changed to Self-Realization Fellowship in the 1930's. He later expanded them into a set of 39 exercises. The goal is to tap into cosmic energy, recharging the whole body. Yogananda explains in his "Autobiography of a Yogi": "Realizing that man’s body is like an electric battery, I reasoned that it could be recharged with energy through the direct agency of the human will…. I therefore taught the Ranchi students my simple “Yogoda” techniques by which the life force, centered in man’s medulla oblongata, can be consciously and instantly recharged from the unlimited supply of cosmic energy."

St. Thomas the Apostle's Church (Detroit, Michigan)

St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic Church was a church located at 8363 and 8383 Townsend Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989, but was subsequently demolished.
History.
St. Thomas the Apostle Parish was a Polish-American Roman Catholic parish founded in 1914, at the eastern edge of the east side Polish neighborhoods of Detroit. A church was constructed in 1923, and the parish had both a grade school and a high school. The parish was one of the fist to experience changes in population, as the original Polish residents began moving out in the mid-20th century. The parish was closed in 1989, and the church demolished soon after.
The school currently serves as St. Thomas Assessment Center for troubled youths.
Description.
The parish complex at St. Thomas the Apostle comprised six buildings, including the church, rectory, school, and convent.
The church was essentially of Romanesque design, with some Art Deco aspects. It was built of brick laid over Dennison Interlocking Tile, sitting atop a limestone base. The building was trimmed with limestone and Tuscan Glazed Faience in various colors. The facade was a series of gable-roof blocks, roofed with Spanish tile. The primary entrance was through a central, side-gable block, sized to match the nave. The entrance was recessed into the center of a projecting porch and surrounded by columned arches. A massive Eucharistic relief was set high in the center of the facade. The church boasted a wealth of decorative art, including stained glass and bronze works.
The rectory was a large, two-story building with a dormer-attic.

St. Catherine of Siena Roman Catholic Church

The St. Catherine of Siena Roman Catholic Church is a church located at 4151 Seminole Street in Detroit, Michigan. It is now the St. Augustine and St. Monica Roman Catholic Church. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.
Description.
The St. Catherine of Siena Parish complex consists of four buildings: the parish school (1913), convent (1926), rectory (1926), and the church itself (1929). All buildings are bacsically Romanesque in style, with some Byzantine elements.
The church is the most visually catching structure. It is built in the form of a Latin cross, of mixed red and brown tapestry brick. The main façade has a gable form with a Romanesque arcaded portico containing the entrance and three tall windows above. A wheel window is placed in the pediment. Single-story wings with entrance doors flank the front, and a tower is located on the right side of the building.
History.
This collection of buildings is significant for its architectural quality. The first building of the parish, the school, was completed in 1913 by Donaldson and Meier at a cost of $52,000. The school building included a chapel and parish hall. The convent and rectory were both completed in 1926, and the church, costing $130,000, was completed in 1929.
Dwindling population in the latter part of the 20th century led to a merger of St. Catherine with the nearby St. Edward's Roman Catholic Church in 1970; the buildings of St. Edward's were demolished. In 1989, the St. Catherine parish was closed. A new parish, christened St. Augustine and St. Monica, was formed from the older St. Catherine/St. Edward's and the nearby St. Bernard's, and currently uses the buildings in the complex.

Health care in France

The French health care system is one of universal health care largely financed by government national health insurance. In its 2000 assessment of world health care systems, the World Health Organization found that France provided the "close to best overall health care" in the world. In 2011, France spent 11.6% of GDP on health care, or US$4,086 per capita, a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe but less than in the US. Approximately 77% of health expenditures are covered by government funded agencies.
Most general physicians are in private practice but draw their income from the public insurance funds. These funds, unlike their German counterparts, have never gained self-management responsibility. Instead, the government has taken responsibility for the financial and operational management of health insurance (by setting premium levels related to income and determining the prices of goods and services refunded). The French government generally refunds patients 70% of most health care costs, and 100% in case of costly or long-term ailments. Supplemental coverage may be bought from private insurers, most of them nonprofit, mutual insurers. Until 2000, coverage was restricted to those who contributed to social security (generally, workers or retirees), excluding some poor segments of the population; the government of Lionel Jospin put into place universal health coverage and extended the coverage to all those legally resident in France. Only about 3.7% of hospital treatment costs are reimbursed through private insurance, but a much higher share of the cost of spectacles and prostheses (21.9%), drugs (18.6%) and dental care (35.9%) "(Figures from the year 2000)". There are public hospitals, non-profit independent hospitals (which are linked to the public system), as well as private for-profit hospitals.
Average life expectancy in France at birth is 81 years.
History.
The current system has undergone several changes since its foundation in 1945, though the basis of the system remains state planned and operated.
Jean de Kervasdoué, a health economist, believes that French medicine is of great quality and is "the only credible alternative to the Americanization of world medicine." According to Kervasdoué, France's surgeons, clinicians, psychiatrists, and its emergency care system (SAMU) are an example for the world. However, despite this, Kervasdoué criticizes the fact that hospitals must comply with 43 bodies of regulation and the nit-picking bureaucracy that can be found in the system. Kervasdoué believes that the state intervenes too much in regulating the daily functions of French hospitals.
Furthermore, Japan, Sweden, and the Netherlands have health care systems with comparable performance to that of France's, yet spend no more than 8% of their GDP (against France's spending of more than 10% of its GDP).
According to various experts, the battered state of the French social security system's finances is causing the growth of France's health care expenses. To control expenses, these experts recommend a reorganization of access to health care providers, revisions to pertinent laws, a repossession by CNAMTS of the continued development of medicines, and the democratization of budgetary arbitration to counter pressure from the pharmaceutical industry.
Health care system.
The entire population must pay compulsory health insurance. The insurers are non-profit agencies that annually participate in negotiations with the state regarding the overall funding of health care in France. There are three main funds, the largest of which covers 84% of the population and the other two a further 12%. A premium is deducted from all employees' pay automatically. The 2001 Social Security Funding Act, set the rates for health insurance covering the statutory health care plan at 5.25% on earned income, capital and winnings from gambling and at 3.95% on benefits (pensions and allowances).
After paying the doctor's or dentist's fee, a proportion is reimbursed. This is around 75 to 80%, but can be as much as 85%. The balance is effectively a co-payment paid by the patient but it can also be recovered if the patient pays a regular premium to a voluntary health insurance scheme. Nationally, about half of such copayments are paid from VHI insurance and half out of pocket.
Under recent rules (the coordinated consultation procedure, in French: ""parcours de soins coordonné""), general practitioners (""médecin généraliste"" or ""docteur"") are expected to act as "gate keepers" who refer patients to a specialist or a hospital when necessary. However the system offers free choice of the reference doctor, which is not restricted to only general practitioner and may still be a specialist or a doctor in a public or private hospital. The goal is to limit the number of consultations for the same illness. The incentive is financial in that expenses are reimbursed at much lower rates for patients who go directly to another doctor (except for dentists, ophthalmologists, gynaecologists and psychiatrists); vital emergencies are still exempt from requiring the advice from the reference doctor, which will be informed later. As costs are borne by the patient and then reimbursed, patients have freedom of choice of where to receive health care services.
Around 65% of hospital beds in France are provided by public hospitals, around 15% by private non-profit organizations, and 20% by for-profit companies.
Minister of Health and Solidarity is a cabinet position in the government of France. The healthcare portfolio oversees the public services and the health insurance part of Social Security. As ministerial departments are not fixed and depend on the Prime Minister's choice, the Minister sometimes has other portfolios among Work, Pensions, Family, the Elderly, Handicapped people and Women's Rights. In that case, they are assisted by junior Ministers who focus on specific parts of the portfolio.
"Médecin généraliste".
The "médecin généraliste" (commonly called "docteur") is responsible for patient long-term care. This implies prevention, education, care of diseases and traumas that do not require a specialist. They also follow severe diseases day-to-day (between acute crises that may require a specialist).
They survey epidemics, fulfil a legal role (consultation of traumas that can bring compensation, certificates for the practice of a sport, death certificates, certificates for hospitalization without consent in case of mental incapacity), and a role in emergency care (they can be called by the "samu", the emergency medical service). They often go to a patient's home if the patient cannot come to the consulting room (especially in case of children or old people) and they must also perform night and week-end duty.
Health insurance.
Because the model of finance in the French health care system is based on a social insurance model, contributions to the program are based on income. Prior to reform of the system in 1998, contributions were 12.8% of gross earnings levied on the employer and 6.8% levied directly on the employee. The 1998 reforms extended the system so that the more wealthy with capital income (and not just those with income from employment) also had to contribute; since then the 6.8% figure has dropped to 0.75% of earned income. In its place a wider levy based on total income has been introduced, gambling taxes are now redirected towards health care and recipients of social benefits also must contribute. Because the insurance is compulsory, the system is effectively financed by general taxation rather than traditional insurance (as typified by auto or home insurance, where risk levels determine premiums).
The founders of the French social security system were largely inspired by the Beveridge Report in the United Kingdom and aimed to create a single system guaranteeing uniform rights for all. However, there was much opposition from certain socio-professional groups who already benefited from the previous insurance coverage that had more favourable terms. These people were allowed to keep their own systems. Today, 95% of the population are covered by 3 main schemes. One for commerce and industry workers and their families, another for agricultural workers and lastly the national insurance fund for self-employed non-agricultural workers.
All working people are required to pay a portion of their income into a health insurance fund, which mutualizes the risk of illness and which reimburses medical expenses at varying rates. Children and spouses of insured individuals are eligible for benefits, as well. Each fund is free to manage its own budget and reimburse medical expenses at the rate it saw fit.
The government has two responsibilities in this system:
Today, this system is more or less intact. All citizens and legal foreign residents of France are covered by one of these mandatory programs, which continue to be funded by worker participation. However, since 1945, a number of major changes have been introduced. Firstly, the different health-care funds (there are five: General, Independent, Agricultural, Student, Public Servants) now all reimburse at the same rate. Secondly, since 2000, the government now provides health care to those who are not covered by a mandatory regime (those who have never worked and who are not students, meaning the very rich or the very poor). This regime, unlike the worker-financed ones, is financed via general taxation and reimburses at a higher rate than the profession-based system for those who cannot afford to make up the difference.
Finally, to counter the rise in health-care costs, the government has installed two plans (in 2004 and 2006), which require most people to declare a referring doctor in order to be fully reimbursed for specialist visits, and which installed a mandatory co-payment of 1 € (about $1.45 USD) for a doctor visit, 0.50 € (about $0.80 USD) for each prescribed medicine and a fee of €16–18 ($20–25) per day for hospital stays and for expensive procedures. Such declaration is not required for children below 16 years old (because they already benefit from another protection program), for foreigners without residence in France (which will get benefits depending on existing international agreements between their own national healthcase program and the French Social Security), or those benefiting from an health-care system of French overseas territories, and for those people that benefit from the minimum medical assistance.
An important element of the French insurance system is solidarity: the more ill a person becomes, the less they pay. This means that for people with serious or chronic illnesses (with vital risks, such as cancers, AIDS, or severe mental illness, where the person becomes very dependant of his medical assistance and protection) the insurance system reimburses them 100% of expenses and waives their co-payment charges.
Finally, for fees that the mandatory system does not cover, there is a large range of private complementary insurance plans available. The market for these programs is very competitive. Such insurance is often subsidised by the employer, which means that premiums are usually modest. 85% of French people benefit from complementary private health insurance.
Quality.
A government body, ANAES, Agence Nationale d'Accréditation et d'Evaluation en Santé (The National Agency for Accreditation and Health Care Evaluation) is responsible for issuing recommendations and practice guidelines. There are recommendations on clinical practice (RPC), relating to the diagnosis, treatment and supervision of certain conditions, and in some cases, to the evaluation of reimbursement arrangements. ANAES also publishes practice guidelines which are recommendations on good practice that doctors are required to follow according to the terms of agreements signed between their professional representatives and the health insurance funds.There are also recommendations regarding drug prescriptions, and to a lesser extent, the prescription or provision of medical examination. By law, doctors must maintain their professional knowledge with ongoing professional education.
Emergency medicine.
Ambulatory care includes care by general practitioners who are largely self-employed and mostly work alone, although about a third of all GPs work in a group practice. GPs do not exercise gatekeeper functions in the French medical system and people can see any registered medical practitioner of choice including specialists. Thus ambulatory care can take place in many settings.
Spending.
The French healthcare system was named by the World Health Organization as the best performing system in the world in terms of availability and organization of health care providers . It is a universal health care system. It features a mix of public and private services, relatively low expenditure, high patient success rates and low mortality rates, and high consumer satisfaction. Its aims are to combine low cost with flexibility of patient choice as well as doctors' autonomy. While 99.9% of the French population is covered, the rising cost of the system has been a source of concern, as has the lack of emergency service in some areas. In 2004, the system underwent a number of reforms, including introduction of the "Carte Vitale" smart card system, improved treatment of patients with rare diseases, and efforts aimed at reducing medical fraud. While private medical care exists in France, the 75% of doctors who are in the national program provide care free to the patient, with costs being reimbursed from government funds. Like most countries, France faces problems of rising costs of prescription medication, increasing unemployment, and a large aging population.
Expenses related to the healthcare system in France represented 10.5% of the country's GDP and 15.4% of its public expenditures. In 2004, 78.4% of these expenses were paid for by the state.
Hospitals.
About 62 percent of French hospital capacity is met by publicly owned and managed hospitals. The remaining capacity is split evenly (18% each) between non-profit sector hospitals (which are linked to the public sector and which tend to be owned by foundations, religious organizations or mutual-insurance associations) and by for-profit institutions.
Public health.
France, as all EU countries, is under an EU directive to reduce sewage discharge to sensitive areas. In 2006, France was only 40% in compliance, one of the lowest achieving countries in the EU with regard to this waste-water treatment standard
Healthcare issues in France.
Obesity in France.
Even though French are among the thinner Europeans (see chart below), obesity in France has been increasingly cited as a major health issue in recent years. It is now considered a political issue whereas just a few years prior it would only have been an issue reported on television talk shows or in women's magazines. There is a myth about French people not getting overweight or obese however France is only ranked as the 128th fattest country in the World, one of the lowest rank among developed countries and French food has long been studied for its healthy diet.
Doctors.
While French doctors only earn about 60% of what American doctors make, their expenses are reduced because they pay no tuition for medical school and malpractice insurance is less costly compared with the United States. The French National Insurance system also pays for a part of social security taxes owed by doctors that agree to charge the government-approved fees.
Public perception.
Historian Dannielle Horan claims that while many in the US deride the French system as "socialized medicine," the French do not consider their mixed public and private system "socialized" and the population tends to look down upon British- and Canadian-style socialized medicine.

Pleurothotonus

Pleurothotonus, commonly known as Pisa syndrome, is a rare neurological disorder which occurs due to prolonged exposure to antipsychotic drugs (which may also be referred to as neuroleptics). It is characterized by dystonia, and abnormal and sustained involuntary muscle contraction. This may cause twisting or jerking movements of the body or a body part. Although Pisa syndrome develops most commonly in those undergoing long-term treatment with antipsychotics, it has been reported less frequently in patients receiving other medications, such as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. However, it has also been seen in those with other diseases causing neurodegeneration and in those who are not receiving any medication (idiopathic Pisa syndrome). The characteristic development of Pisa syndrome consists of two types of dystonia: acute dystonia and tardive dystonia (also known as tardive dyskinesia). The underlying pathology of drug-induced Pisa syndrome is very complex, and development may be due to an underlying dopaminergic-cholinergic imbalance, or serotonergic/noradrenergic dysfunction.
Causes.
Pisa syndrome is predominantly caused by a prolonged administration or an overly dosed administration of antipsychotic drugs. Although antipsychotic drugs are known to be the main drugs that are concerned with this syndrome, several other drugs are reported to have caused the syndrome as well. Certain antidepressants, psychoactive drugs, and antiemetics have also been found to cause Pisa syndrome in patients. 
Drugs found to have caused Pisa Syndrome:
Based on the drugs that caused Pisa syndrome, it has been implicated that the syndrome may be due to a dopaminergic-cholinergic imbalance or a serotonergic or noradrenergic dysfunction. For the development of Pisa syndrome that cannot be alleviated by anticholinergic drugs, it has been considered that asymmetric brain functions or neural transmission may be the underlying mechanism. How these drugs interact with the biochemistry of the brain to cause the syndrome is unknown and a topic of current research.
Risk factors.
Typically, females and older patients with organic brain changes are more likely to develop Pisa syndrome. Organic brain changes are physical changes in the brain which lead to neurological dysfunction, including dementia and frontal lobe syndrome. This includes the presence of neurodegenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease.
Symptoms.
The predominant symptom of Pisa syndrome is dystonia. Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contraction leading to abnormal posture, twisting, and repetitive movement. In Pisa Syndrome specifically there is commonly a tonic flexion of the trunk of the body to one side, leading to a slight lean (reminiscent of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, hence the name "Pisa syndrome"). This is usually associated with a backward axial rotation of the spine and indifferent to markedly abnormal posture. Patients diagnosed with Pisa Syndrome usually experience either acute dystonia or tardive dystonia, also known as tardive dyskinesia. Differential diagnosis between the two may be hard to accomplish without a complete patient history, since both types of dystonia may occur simultaneously in a patient. These symptoms generally disappear after discontinuation of the antipsychotic drug. The time of onset of symptoms may vary depending on drug being administered and the neurological characteristics of the patient in question.
Acute dystonia.
Acute dystonia nearly always develops a few weeks after a dopamine blocking agent/medication has begun or a substantial increase in antipsychotic dosage. An acute dystonic reaction consists of sustained, painful muscular spasms, producing twisting of the trunk/body and abnormal posture. The most frequent occurrences of these spasms have been reported in the neck, tongue, and jaw. Oculogyric crisis and opisthotonus are also very common. Acute effects of dopamine antagonists also include Parkinsons-like symptoms, manifested by bradykinesia, pill rolling tremor, and rigidity of the body. These movements may fluctuate over hours and temporarily dissipate in response to reassurance, and the individual episodes may last minutes to hours. Acute reactions are more common in older patients and females. The pathophysiology underlying these reactions is unknown, but the movements usually occur during the period when blood medication level is dropping. The acute syndromes which occur due to prolonged exposure to a dopamine antagonist are collectively termed extrapyramidal symptoms, EPS.
Tardive dyskinesia.
Tardive dyskinesias are involuntary movements of the lips, tongue, face, trunk, and extremities which occur in patients with prolonged exposure to dopamine antagonists or antipsychotic medications. Clinical findings have provided evidence that adenosine, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, plays a role in the development of tardive dykinesias. Tardive dykinesias have also been associated with polymorphism in the dopamine receptor D2 gene, dopamine receptor D3 gene, dopamine transporter (DAT) gene, and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) gene. Tardive dyskinesias are chronic compared to acute dystonia, which occur in an episodic fashion.
Treatment and Medication.
There are two lines of treatment for Pisa syndrome. The first line entails discontinuation or reduction in dose of the antipsychotic drug(s). The second line of treatment is an anticholinergic medication. A pharmacological therapy for Pisa syndrome caused by prolonged use of antipsychotic drugs has not been established yet.
Reduction of drug dosage.
Reducing the dosage of the antipsychotic drugs resulted in gradual improvement in the abnormal posture. In some cases, discontinuing the use of those drugs resulted in complete disappearance of the syndrome. The time it took for the improvement and the disappearance of the syndrome depended on the type of drug being administered or the specific cause of the syndrome itself.
Anticholinergic drugs.
Anticholinergic drugs have been reported to be extremely effective in 40% of the patients with the Pisa syndrome. Patients with Pisa syndrome that is resistant to anticholinergic drugs is mostly resolved by the reduction of the administration of the antipsychotic drugs as previously mentioned. While the specific pathology underlying idiopathic Pisa syndrome is unknown, the administration of anticholinergic drugs has provided resolution in known cases.
Case studies.
Aripiprazole.
The first case of Pisa syndrome developed under the use of aripiprazole was documented in May 2002. A 77-year-old woman suffering from dementia was administered the drug after initially undergoing treatment with quetiapine. After about a week of the new treatment with aripiprazole the woman began to exhibit symptoms of acute dystonia, typical of a patient with Pisa syndrome. Within a couple of days of being taken off the treatment, the patient no longer exhibited the symptoms of Pisa syndrome. Although the patient exhibited Pisa syndrome after being treated with aripiprazole, the patient’s development of Pisa syndrome could have been caused by her withdrawal of quetiapine and her further introduction of aripiprazole.
Ziprasidone.
Drug switching, when patients switch from one atypical antipsychotic drug to another, has been observed to produce Pisa syndrome, such as in the case of a 38-year-old male patient being treated for schizophrenia. The patient began to develop symptoms of Pisa syndrome after switching from olanzapine to ziprasidone treatment. The man exhibited both a leaning posture at a 30˚ angle and tilting of his head to the right side. This process was also exhibited in a female patient also suffering from schizophrenia, who was first treated with clozapine and then switched to ziprasidone. The patient was able to return to her normal state weeks after being taken off of ziprasidone treatment.
Parkinson’s Disease.
A man diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at the age of 55, began to develop symptoms of Pisa syndrome after switching from his previous medication to levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone tablets years after his diagnosis. The patient had no history of taking any particular medication that previously developed Pisa syndrome; such as neuroleptics, antidepressants, antiemetic, cholinesterase inhibitors, or any other similar form of the drugs known to onset symptoms of disease. The patient demonstrated a tilting of his trunk toward the left side. Once the patient returned to his original medication regimen, the symptoms of the tonic deviation regressed.
History.
Pisa syndrome was discovered by Karl Axel Ekbom, a Swedish neurologist, in the early 1970s. Cases of the syndrome were first observed in three elderly female patients suffering from presenile dementia. Each of these women were undergoing treatment with the antipsychotic drug methylperone, haloperidol or a combination of the two. The use of neuroleptic drugs caused the patients to exhibit a lateral flexion along with a rotation of the trunk. As the patients walked they experienced an increase in rotation. The postural and gait disturbances symptoms is what set this apart from any other form of acute dystonia previously observed. These symptoms proved to be the making of a new dystonic reaction, which was termed pleurothotonus or Pisa syndrome. 
The first patient, a 59-year-old woman with no family history of neuroleptic disease, was put through two periods of treatment with methylperone. The first trial of the drug was administered in February 1971. In the beginning the patient demonstrated no symptoms of dystonia. However, within the first few days the patient began to exhibit a tilting to right upon walking. The women was then taken off the methylperone treatment and as a result progressively regressed back to her previous state of exhibiting no symptoms within the first two months. The patient started a second trial of methylperone treatment in late October 1971. After a little over a week of the drug treatment, she began to express previous symptoms that including a bending of the trunk towards the right along with a rotation. The patient also experienced a pulling away from her direction of walking and a difficulty of turning. Within a couple of days of exhibiting symptoms, the patient was then treated with orphenadrine. This treatment helped regress the expressed symptoms quicker than the first time. By the end of the week the patient was able to return to her normal state.
The second patient to undergo methylperone treatment was a 63-year-old woman with presenile dementia, which caused her to experience restlessness and paranoid hallucinations. The methylperone treatment was able to alleviate the woman’s problems induced by her dementia. It did not take long for the woman to begin to experience symptoms of Pisa syndrome and as a result she was taken off of the methylperone treatment. Like the first patient, she was able to overcome the induced symptoms of Pisa syndrome within a month. The patient was again treated with methylperone after two months from the first treatment. Soon after the patient began to lean toward the right when standing or walking. She was then administered orphenadrine, which soon stopped the patient’s tilting posture.
The final patient was a 69-year-old woman, diagnosed with presenile dementia after she expressing symptoms of memory dysfunction, depression and urinary incontinence. As a result the woman was put under a methylperone treatment, which soon caused a bending and rotation to her left. These symptoms disappeared soon after being taken off of methylperone. Unlike the other two patients, when the woman was again administered methylperone she did not exhibit any previous dystonic symptoms after two weeks of treatment. The patient was then switched to a small dosage of haloperidol along with the typical dosage of orphenadrine used on the previous patients. Instead of not having symptoms of Pisa syndrome, the woman began to experience a leaning to her left side and a particular rotation of her shoulder towards the left. Once haloperidol was eliminated from the treatment the patient no longer had these symptoms.
As more cases of the syndrome came about, research discovered that the switching of drug treatments can be debated as a possible inducer of the disease. Other cases of the disease have been proven to be caused by medications other than neuroleptic drugs. These patients were observed exhibiting symptoms of Pisa syndrome as a result of having a prior neurodegenerative disease.
Further research.
Current research has been focusing on discovering the underlying mechanisms of Pisa syndrome, since little is known about the biological and pharmacological reasons Pisa syndrome occurs (although theories about dopaminergic dysfunction have been suggested). While Pisa syndrome is mostly associated with antipsychotic drugs, there have been incidents of idiopathic Pisa Syndrome, the development of Pisa syndrome in those with other neurological disorders, and Pisa syndrome in those with intellectual disability. Future research hopes to pinpoint the essential neurological disorder or disorders underlying the development of Pisa syndrome so more that more effective medication and treatment may be created and/or administered.

Keep on the Shadowfell

Keep on the Shadowfell is the first official product from the 4th edition "Dungeons & Dragons" line. It is part one of a three-part series of adventures introducing the 4th edition "Dungeons & Dragons" concept of Points of Light, a loosely connected and open-ended setting designed to allow modules and Dungeon Masters created materials to be seamlessly integrated into either a single, largely unmapped fantasy world or a Dungeon Master custom made setting. The adventure, written by Mike Mearls and Bruce R. Cordell was published in 2008 by Wizards of the Coast, followed by the sequels "Thunderspire Labyrinth" and "Pyramid of Shadows". The adventure is designed for character of levels 1-3 and the module code "H" stands for Heroic Tier. This module is set in a region of the world called the Nentir Vale, the details of which are given in the 4th edition "Dungeon Master's Guide".
Story.
The village of Winterhaven in the Nentir Vale is being menaced by kobold raiders. The players are ambushed by these kobolds on their way to Winterhaven; upon arrival at Winterhaven they are asked to clean out the kobold's nest. The players soon discover the kobolds are a pawn of Kalarel, a priest of Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath. Kalarel is lairing at a local ruined keep which contains a long-sealed rift to the Shadowfell, a plane of shadow and undeath; he plans to open this rift to connect the material world to Orcus' temple in the Shadowfell and thereby unleash an army of undead upon the unsuspecting region. The players journey to the keep and descend through its crypts, resulting in a final climactic confrontation with Kalarel.
Editions.
In April 2009 Wizards of the Coast released an updated PDF version of "Keep on the Shadowfell" that fixed many of the typographical errors throughout the module, revised the way that many encounters were presented and formatted, and re-tuned the difficulty of certain key sections by adding or subtracting monsters. This updated PDF was made available to the public free of charge through Wizards' D&D Test Drive program.
Publication history.
The adventure was designed by Bruce R. Cordell and Mike Mearls and was published in May 2008. Cover art was by William O'Connor, with interior art by Miguel Coimbra and Eric Deschamps.
"Keep on the Shadowfell" was the first adventure module for D&D 4th Edition released to retail. It was released prior to the core 4th Edition rulebooks becoming available, and therefore includes pre-generated characters and a condensed version of many of the game rules. For early adopters, "Keep on the Shadowfell" was the first opportunity to play an official D&D 4th Edition product.
Reception.
The reviewer from "Pyramid" commented: "This is the first scenario for the new edition, the first part of a campaign that will take the player characters from 1st through to 30th level, and the first product released for it. This makes it quite a significant item, but then its significance does not end there, for "H1, Keep on the Shadowfell" also includes the rules needed to play the scenario."

Hobo Bobo

Hobo Bobo is a Merrie Melodies cartoon short released by Warner Bros. on May 17, 1947, written by Warren Foster and directed by Robert McKimson, with narration by Robert C. Bruce, and Bobo's only line delivered by Stan Freberg.
Plot.
Bobo, a baby Indian elephant, sees a dark future for himself if he should remain in India to haul logs with his trunk for the rest of his life. After receiving a letter from his uncle in America, he decides to emigrate there to play on a circus baseball team. After Bobo's attempts to stow away aboard a ship bound for the United States fail repeatedly, he is advised by the mynah bird (better known from the Inki series) to paint himself pink. As seeing pink elephants is the traditional hallucination of the drunkard, neither the captain, the crew nor the passengers will acknowledge seeing Bobo, and thus he has the virtual run of the ship for the entire voyage.
When Bobo finally disembarks in New York City, he is likewise unacknowleged, until a street-cleaning vehicle washes his pink paint off, and the populace panics at the sight of a normal gray baby elephant on the street. The police end up arresting Bobo.
Hauled into court by the police, the judge sentences him to life...at the circus. At the circus, Bobo promptly engaged by the baseball team as the official batboy. Bobo angrily utters his only line in the film "Batboy, shmatboy! I'm still carrying logs!"
Sequel.
The sequel to this cartoon "Gone Batty" was originally released in 1954, and re-released as a "Merrie Melodies" Blue Ribbon classic in 1963.

Stick candy

Stick candy (also called candy stick, barber pole candy, or barber pole) is a long, cylindrical variety of hard candy, usually four to seven inches in length and 1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter, but in some extraordinary cases up to 14 inches in length and two inches in diameter. Like candy canes, they usually have at least two different colors (either opaque or translucent) swirled together in a spiral pattern, resembling a barber's pole.
The candy has a long history in the United States, where it is believed to have been developed, and is often marketed as an "old fashioned" candy. It is often sold in general stores and similar shops specializing in nostalgia items. The Cracker Barrel chain estimates that its stores sell a total length of of stick candy each year.
History.
Stick candy has been around since at least the fall of 1837, when it was shown at the Exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association alongside lobster candy. Stick candy was popular with both children and adults in the U.S. as early as the 1860s, and the selling of this type of candy (particularly during the carnival season in the warmer months) was described as being lucrative. One contemporary account describes broken pieces of stick candy being sold in paper containers, being presented by candy sellers to rural people as something special, and commanding a high price.
Candy sticks were the subject of an 1885 song called the "The Candy Stripe":
Stick Candy was the subject of a poem from the 1907 collection "A Rose of the Old Regime: And other Poems of Home-Love and Childhood" by the Bentztown Bard (Folger McKinsey). The first two verses are:
Stick candy is also mentioned in a 1909 poem by Madison Julius Cawein:
Production and marketing.
Stick candy is produced by mixing granulated sugar (and sometimes also corn syrup) with water and a small amount of cream of tartar. The dough is mixed with color and flavoring, then drawn and twisted, producing the characteristic spiral pattern, and finally cut to the proper length and allowed to cool and harden.
In the 1800s, bright red (and sometimes also bright blue) swirled with white were the most common colors. Although unbent and thicker, it is similar to a candy cane (which retains the aforementioned red-and-white color scheme).
Stick candy comes in a wide assortment of flavors, sometimes quite exotic, such as root beer, sassafras, horehound, cinnamon, butterscotch, piña colada, peppermint, clove, spearmint, licorice, cotton candy, and wintergreen. They also come in a wide variety of fruit and berry flavors. There are also varieties containing two different flavors swirled together.
Stick candy is generally sold shrink-wrapped in clear plastic, and traditionally displayed for sale in wide-mouthed glass jars.
They were originally sold by the piece for a nickel or dime. As of 2008 they more typically sell for 25 cents to 75 cents each, although they are also sold in bulk.
Some varieties of stick candy are filled with sweet cream.
Consumption.
As a hard candy, stick candy is slow to dissolve and candy sticks last a very long time if consumed by sucking. As with lollipops, they are most often consumed by sucking, but may also be crushed by the teeth.
Stick candy is sometimes used as an ingredient in other foods: crushed and used in ice cream pudding, or frosting, or cut into thin slices and used as a topping for cakes. It can also be used in other candy, particularly in combination with chocolate.

New Georgia, Liberia

New Georgia is a township in Montserrado County, Liberia that was first settled by Africans who had been taken from slave ships seized or wrecked near the United States and then sent to Liberia after several years had passed. 
In July 1827 a ship named "Norfolk" carried 131, 143 or 144 Africans to Liberia from the United States, of whom 78 were adult women and another eleven or twelve were under ten years of age. One hundred twenty of those people had been found on the slave ship "Antelope" when it was seized off the coast of Florida in 1820. They had been held in Georgia for seven years waiting for the courts to settle their fate. After being kept under supervision in Monrovia for a while, the people from the "Antelope" were settled along Stockton Creek on Bushrod Island about four miles up the Mesurado River from Monrovia. The settlement was named New Georgia after their home of the prior seven years. Although "recaptured" Africans (people taken from slave ships by U.S. Navy anti-slave trade patrol ships) had been brought to Liberia previously, none were still there when the people from the "Antelope" arrived. Most, if not all, of the people found on the "Antelope" in 1820 and taken to Liberia in 1827 had originally been loaded on slave ships at Cabinda, and were probably Congos.
In March 1830 92 African men who had survived the 1827 wreck of the slave ship "Guerrero" near Key Largo, Florida were brought to Liberia from the United States and settled at New Georgia. These men were mostly Igbos and "Persas" or "Pessas". About 150 people who had been freed from coastal slaving stations by Americo-Liberians also settled in New Georgia.
In the 1830s New Georgia consisted of separate communities of Congos and Igbos separated by a small rivulet, with a total of about 300 people. The "recaptured" Africans at New Georgia had inter-married between the groups and many of the men married women from local tribes. There was a schoolhouse for the children, and the town was described as being pleasing in appearance. Houses in New Georgia were surrounded by vegetable and fruit gardens and the town was surrounded by fields where maize, rice, cassava and vegetables were grown. New Georgia was an important supplier to the market in Monrovia. The men of the town also sawed lumber and made shingles. The people of New Georgia prospered, and were described as "decidedly the most contented and independent of any in the colony." New Georgia is listed as one of the settlements making up the Commonwealth of Liberia in the 1839 Constitution. In 1878 a traveler reported about 500 people living in New Georgia.
As of 2009 a bridge connecting New Georgia with Barnersville was under construction. The new bridge will replace one that was built in 1992 for military purposes by peacekeepers from the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group. The badly deteriorated bridge had been closed to vehicle traffic for several years before it collapsed in 2009. Also as of 2009 a new elementary school operated by the United Methodist Church was under construction in New Georgia.

Iodine trifluoride

Iodine trifluoride is an interhalogen compound with the chemical formule IF3. It is a yellow solid which decomposes above −28 °C. It can be synthesised from the elements, but care must be taken to avoid the formation of IF5.
Reactions.
F2 reacts with I2 to yield IF3 at −45 °C in CCl3F. Alternatively, at low temperatures, the fluorination reaction I2 + 3XeF2 → 2IF3 + 3Xe can be used. Not much is known about iodine trifluoride as it is so unstable.
Chemical properties.
Iodine trifluoride has five electron pairs, and like chlorine trifluoride is T-shaped as predicted by VSEPR Theory.

Among Bill's other credits, he is most known for his soap opera role as Bill Harrison on ABC's "General Hospital". Initially when he was cast in 1980, he was only supposed to be on the show for two weeks, but his role was expanded because of a lucky break with a storyline he was involved in with actor Anthony Geary. By 1990 when the storyline he was involved in had ended, he had taped over 800 shows in an 11-year run. After a one-year hiatus, he unofficially retired from acting. From that point on he mainly concentrated on writing television and movie scripts while promoting them through his production company.
Actor Will Geer of the TV show "The Waltons" was his mentor. His best advice to 18 year old Bill when he wanted to make acting his profession was, ""Make sure that you have something to fall back on."" On that advice, he started his own production company at the age of 20.
Bob Hope awarded him first place in a baby contest when he was one year old.
He was a standup comic at the famous Comedy Store on Sunset Strip where comedian Jimmie Walker used to introduce him as the "White Shadow".
He worked at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood with actress Charlene Tilton when she was 18 and he was 20.
Later on, as an assistant manager at Mann's Chinese Theatre, he hired actress Michele Greene for her first job.

FunGals

FunGals are a brand name of children's underwear; manufactured by their parent company Fruit of the Loom. The trademark for the brand name was registered on May 29, 1987.
Summary.
Mostly worn by young girls under the age of 12, these undergarments are intended for young girls that is a developmental stepping stone between training pants and adult female undergarments. They are inspired by Saturday morning cartoons, movies, and video games intended for a young female audience. Examples of licenses used include Bananas in Pyjamas, Teletubbies, Scooby Doo, Dora the Explorer and SpongeBob SquarePants. More recently, licenses like "The Smurfs", "Angry Birds", and "Little Miss" have been used for FunGals.
The male equivalent of FunGals are called Funpals (for young boys); they competed against Hanes' "Showtoons". As of 2007, both FunGals and Funpals that are sold in the Americas have been manufactured in El Salvador and Honduras, while worldwide manufacturing is done in parts of Europe and North Africa. All FunGals styles use the classic brief design that would be informally described as "granny panties" in adult sizes. Unlike its male equivalent (Funpals), the designs can either be located on the center position of the undergarment or scattered throughout the undergarment.
Sizes for FunGals undergarments typically range from a size XS to a size 3XL (equivalent to a women's M).

Injection port

An injection port is a medical device used for the administration of insulin or other physician approved medicine into the subcutaneous tissue (the tissue layer just below the skin). The device is similar to infusion sets used by insulin pumps, except it is configured to receive a syringe instead of a tubing system.
An injection port is usually a disposable device applied by the patient and worn for period of 3–5 days. When giving shots via an injection port, the needle stays above the surface of the skin. Medication is delivered via a short, soft cannula.
An injection port can be used in conjunction with multiple daily injections of insulin by people with diabetes. It can also be used for the subcutaneous administration of any other physician prescribed medication
Applying, Wearing and Using.
Injection ports are usually applied by the patient. The device comes with a needle surrounded by a soft cannula. The needle and cannula are manually inserted into the patient's tissue. Immediately after insertion the needle is removed and the cannula remains below the surface of the skin.
Ports are usually worn on the abdomen, but can also be worn on other areas such as the buttocks, thigh or arm. Typical injection ports are worn for 3–5 days and then replaced with another port.
Insulin is injected via a syringe into the injection port. Medication immediately flows through the device's cannula into the subcutaneous tissue layer. No medication is stored in the device (other than the small amount of dead-space in the medication channel within the device).
Current Injection Ports.
Insuflon.
The Insuflon, manufactured and distributed by Unomedical, is inserted at a 20-45° angle and rests flush against the skin similar to an IV.
I-Port.
The I-Port, manufactured and distributed by Patton Medical Devices, is a domed shaped device with a cannula inserted at a 90° angle. The i-port Advance combines an i-port with an insertion device.

Classical Hindu law in practice

Classical Hindu law in practice originates from community, not a state polity. In this way, particular groups of society began to gain influence in the creation and administration of law. Primary corporate groups, Kingships, and Brahmins were the factions, which conveyed Hindu jurisprudence in practice. Corporate groups were responsible for legislating law through the conception of social norms; kingships were responsible for the administration of punishment and the worldly Hindu system; and Brahmins were responsible for ritual, penance, and the maintenance of a spiritual Hindu system.
Administration of Classical Hindu Law.
Corporate groups.
Corporate group's in medieval India included, but were not limited to, merchants, traders, religious specialists, soldiers, agriculturalists, pastoralists, and castes. These groups held legal prominence in classical Indian society because the primary authority and responsibility for law at the time came from the community, not a state polity. Particularly, early Dharmasūtra (dharmasutra) texts, beginning in about the 2nd BC, recognized a full-fledged theology surrounding the household institution. The texts viewed households and families as the archetype of community, "an exemplary institution of religious and legal reflection of Hindu jurisprudence". Thus, Hindu jurisprudence portrayed the household, not the state, as the primary institution of law. Connectedly, the household is the institution to which Hindu law is most applied. For example, the texts are most explicit in reference to quotidian household acts such as eating, bathing, creating a family, etc. The focus on the household and other local institutions helped to identify the shared goals and goods within society which are inherent to Hindu law. Furthermore, small-scale communities such as the household were more effective in imposing the acceptance of common values and core ideas.
Because of the social implication revolving around the importance of the household and the community in the creation and administration of law, Hindu law jurisprudentially subordinated state law to the law of castes and life-stages (varnasramadharma). In this manner, each caste and life-stage was responsible for highly localized occupations. –

IV. Śūdra
Although the household and family were central to corporate groups’ influence, mideival India was a time of political integration over larger and larger core areas. During the time, corporate groups showed increased importance in the creation and administration of law. Such influence came with the development of corporate groups as intermediary tools. These intermediate-corporate groups exercised influence in two main ways.—1) they moderate legal influences of both "highly local sources (villages, families, etc)" and "elite-level political rulers", which promotes pragmatic conflict resolution and the circulation of legal standards for specific groups, and 2) They reconcile legal norms that influence local and regional customary law with esoteric Brahminical dialogue of Dharmaśāstra which establish "viable ideologies" that respect both customary and textual law.
Corporate groups also created their own laws and systems of jurisprudence. Specifically, the concept of ācāra in the Hindu legal texts (i.e. the Dharmaśāstra) legitimized these localized laws 
. Ācāra allowed localized corporate groups to create their own laws, especially in the situations where Hindu legal texts were vague, ambiguous, or completely silent. In particular, ācāra of specific corporate groups plays out in practice as "norms accepted and imposed by the leaders of various social institutions". The key to the legitimization of these norms created and accepted by the leaders of corporate groups is the concept of the ‘good person’ in ācāra. This principal allows for the dissemination of sastric and Vedic control over practice through the mediation of experts who are learned in the texts. Through this, the Dharmaśāstra is connected to real life in a "mediate" way. Ācāra is also recognized and validated in a legal sense through the device of paribhāṣā, which deemed the conventional rules of ācāra as technical supplementary refinements of the rules of the śāstra.
Kingships.
The dharmasastras, starting with Manu, first addressed the function of the king pertaining to the administration of Hindu law. These texts define the king as ‘he who has been anointed.’ Many scholars interpret anointment as the celebration of coronation rites, and thus believe that the ceremony is necessary to invest the king with supreme authority. Although no rules lay down why or how a particular individual fits to qualify as king, Manu VII.2 indicates that only a Kṣatriya has the right to kingship. Some assume this is because the Kṣatriya possessed the force necessary to obtain obedience. However, interpreters of other dharmasastras, dispute this qualifying trait. The king was considered to have a divine nature, but not because of birth or immortality. Rather, the king encompassed god-likeness through exercising the royal function, which the texts say the gods created. This royal function is the source of the king's authority. The royal function vests the king with the power of command (kṣatra) and the mission to protect the people and give them the guarantee of security. The sastras delineate the royal function to be the king's dharma (rājadharma). Aside from physical protection from the harmful in and outside of king's jurisdiction, rājadharma protects and permits his subjects’ dharma to flourish. In this way, the king's dharma encompasses all dharma since each individual's performance of his or her personal duties is dependent on the protection secured by the king. Because of this interconnectedness between rājadharma and individual dharma (swadharma) "the salvation of the king depends on his subjects, just as the salvation of the subjects depend on the king". The king's spiritual happiness depends on his subjects, for he suffers the consequences of their sins and profits from the merits they acquire. This relation applies vice versa as well.
Punishment and justice.
The royal function gives two main privileges: the right to tax and the right to punish (daṇḍa), and they are benefits outlined solely for the king. Only the king may use punishment to secure the execution of his orders. Due to his ability to punish, the king possesses an unlimited power on the temporal plane, and he may do whatever he wishes. Narada says, "whatever the king does is justified: such is the rule." Furthermore, the execution of punishment ensures justice within the king's jurisdiction, and thus the king is the sole judge of the means needed to accomplish his mission of justice. In this vein, he may act as he deems necessary for justice. Moreover, exercising the royal function to maintain justice is equivalent to the celebration of a sacrifice, which keeps the king pure no matter what actions he must commit to bring a culprit to justice. However, although a king is always justified on a temporal plane, he would suffer the consequences of poor actions in his next lives.
Punishment falls under royal authority because it pertains to accomplishing true justice—a concept only the king can judge. Thus, where there is textual silence, kings are responsible for administrating trials (vyavahāra) of criminal law as well as administering punishment (daṇḍa) for criminal acts. King's judge trials other than criminal cases too, except when parties do not wish to appear before him. When parties do not wish to bring a complaint to the king, individuals and corporate groups conduct their own trials. In these cases, although corporate groups such as castes and vocational sects have their own jurisdiction (which came from customary origins) they are still in the king's control. The king exercises this control through the recognition of a corporate group's particular jurisprudence. Recognition is important because the king's court is the only jurisdiction Dharmasastras identifies, thus the king's acceptance of other courts transfers sastric meaning to the particular jurisdictions. The king also employs danda when the Dharmasastra gives more than one penalty for a crime or when texts are contradictory. He is a source of last resort on questions of both fact and law, but once the king passes judgment it is not up for review.
Lawmaking.
Kings were not very active in legislating especially for the reason that Hindu legal texts always preceded the authority of the king. In this way, kings were limited in their ability to make laws on conduct because the Veda already outlined dharma. Judgments made by the king were never law, but considered orders. These orders did not change laws or give new interpretations to texts but merely secured order and peace to the king's jurisdiction. More reasonably, the king was an administrator rather than a legislator. As an administrator, the king maintained peace between his subjects rather than made laws. In addition, royal authority did allow the king to divide tasks of administration amongst ministers and to define the scope and the powers of each ministry. Davis further attributes the lack of royal legislation or edict to the social context presumed by Hindu jurisprudence (i.e. the subordination of the state to the household). In this way, "the state is jurisprudentially part of the household dharma of the ruler" 
Brahminical jurisprudence.
The Brahmin was an integral part of the administration of classical Hindu law. For Gautama, the Brahmins and the king sustain the divine order of the world, the Brahmins with their council and the king by punishment. In this way, dharma cannot come to fruition without the two castes’ cooperation. The Brahmin's opinion is the only counterbalance to the king's authority in society, and because of this, the texts say that the king cannot make a decision without the advice of a Brahmin. For this reason, Brahmins have a right to participate in the court of justice. Additionally, when a king cannot preside over a case himself, a Brahmin must be appointed to take his place. The Brahmin not only gives advice on the administration of justice but also in affairs of the state. "Brahmin is master when the question is one of ritual and of penance. But his scope extends in reality over all the field of royal activity, as much on its political side as on its religious". The superiority of the Brahmin is not attached to their birth (varna) but to the fact that they are devoted to the study of the Veda, and thus are qualified to instruct other people. Because of this devotion to the Veda, the Brahmin is more closely in line with the divine than the king. Thus, Gautama says, the king is the master of all with the exception of the Brahmin. Such high ranking in the classical Hindu law system is apparent in that Brahmin's are exempt from taxes, and may own land (something that is reserved for only kings and Brahmins).
Judicial practices of Classical Hindu Law.
There are no references of Judicial procedure in early Vedic times but there was a frequent mention of the term Rta implying that there was a divine cosmic order by which the universe was regulated. The idea of Dharma seems to have developed from Rta, since Dharma later became the word commonly used in ancient India to designate law. The Rig Veda provides little evidence of civil law. In ancient India Dharma had a religious basis and was enforced by religious threat. It changed not by the will of the king but the evolution of social custom usages and practices. During the Brahmana period, the process of giving punishments to culprits was formed and for this reason law-assistants were appointed. The full Judicial procedure came into light during the composition of the Dharmaśāstras and Smrtis. King figures appeared as the highest judicial authority with a network of courts established under him.
The courts consisted of ten members King, Pravivaka, the Sabhyas, the Ganika (accountant), the Lekhaka (Clerk) and court inspector.
The decision of a case in ancient India was based on eight sources according to brahmanical law givers. These sources are the three Pramanas (possession, documents, and witnesses) logical inference, the usages of the country, sapathas (oaths and ordeals), the kings edict and admission of the litigants. If there were cases where no possessions, documents and recourse can be provided the decision of the King became the ultimate authority.
Four parts of a trial—
Ordeals.
Ordeals also referred to as Divya were divine methods of proof. They decided what cannot be or is not to be decided by human means of proof. The general rule stated by Yājñavalkya, Narada, Brahaspati, Katyayana is that ordeals are to be retorted to only if there is no human evidence or circumstantial evidence available. Different kinds of ordeals are mentioned at different places, Manu gives only two ordeals i.e. holding of fire and plunging in water. Yet Yājñavalkya and Vishnu give a list of five, namely balance, fire, water, poison, consecrate water. Narada gives seven different types of ordeals, i.e. ordeal by balance, fire, water, poison, libration, rice, hot piece of gold. Though there has been evidence found that shows the practice of only two ordeals i.e. ordeal by rice and ordeal by sacred libation. They show up in the sources from ancient Kashmir. In the final decisions by the King human modes of proof ruled over divine modes of proof. Ordeals were only used in extraordinary circumstances. There are also more restrictions on who can perform what type of ordeal. Ordeals were generally performed in the presence of King, the judge, learned Brahmans and the public. The place and time where the ordeals could be performed also held importance. They were usually administered either at dawn or in the forenoon or sometimes even late at night. Sunday was the preferred day to administer them. They usually took place at places like temple, royal gate, public place where four roads meet and the hall of justice. The chief judge by the order of the King had to conduct all the rites like a sacrificial priest. The chief judge and the Sodhya had to take religious dips, observe a fast and convoke all deities.
Four major ordeals
Other types of ordeals included ordeals mentioned in the Smrtis like the ordeal of sacred libation in which an image of a deity was washed in holy water and the accused had to drink that water. If within a certain time period a misfortune occurred in his life he was found to be guilty. Ordeal of rice grains, ordeal of heated piece of gold, ordeal by ploughshare, ordeal by lot also existed within various texts. Ordeals played a significant part in the judicial administration of ancient India, even though they were not really rational and couldn’t really detect guilt. As pointed out in Medhatithi ordeals were like magic and were meant to scare the guilty party and come out with the truth.
Oaths.
Oaths are an affirmation of truth which can be liable to punishment for perjury if the statement given turns out to be false.
Manu recommended that when human proofs failed Sapatha or oath could be applied in search of the truth. According to the Smrti oaths were intended to be used in simple cases, while ordeals were used only in serious cases. A person making an oath was to swear oh his near and dear ones. He might touch the head or feet of a Brahman or his wife or his son, or the feet of an image of a deity or take sacred grass or sesamum, silver, gold, earth, fire, water according as the value of the disputed property. The waiting period on the oaths was one, three, five or more days depending on the nature of the accusation. There is a great amount of sanctity attached to Oaths as explained in Manu that if a man swears on an oath falsely even in a small matter will be lost in this world as well as the next.

Alternative to Suspension

Alternative to Suspension (ATS) is a program created through the American Lung Association of North Carolina. ATS is offered to students in violation of their school's tobacco-free policies. The program is conducted outside of regular classroom hours, and offers an opportunity to educate students about their own tobacco consumption while allowing them to continue regular schooling. ATS is a mandatory program consisting of four sessions of approximately 50 minutes each. This program is meant to complement the Not On Tobacco (N-O-T) program, also facilitated by the American Lung Association. N-O-T is a voluntary program. Both N-O-T and ATS focus on education and allowing students to make informed, educated decisions regarding their own habits. 
Program Outline.
ATS is divided into four separate sessions, each with unique goals and information.
Session One.
The first session of the ATS program is geared at orientation and creating a comfortable environment in which students and facilitators can interact. The confidence of the sessions is stressed. Basic facts about smoking and tobacco's health consequences are relayed. A series of statistics are discussed in a fact vs. fiction dialogue between instructor and students.
Session Two.
The second session focuses on addiction. Students are informed on the various ways nicotine is addictive, and the effects of addiction over self-control. Students discuss the various triggers that bring about a craving for tobacco, and the role that nicotine plays in their own daily lives. Discussion focuses on how nicotine addiction can influence a teenager's decisions and lifestyle. An exercise is implemented to show the financial impact of nicotine addiction.
Session Three.
Session three centers on strategies for coping without tobacco. Alternative activities to smoking and chewing tobacco are given as healthier ways to fulfill the same roles tobacco has previously played. Students are asked to define what it means to live a healthy lifestyle and how abstinence from smoking and other activities can lead to an all around healthier way of living.
Session Four.
The fourth session encourages students to look at the big picture. Change towards a tobacco-free lifestyle is put into prospective, and students are asked to understand what change means in their lives and strive to continue the positive trends started in this program. At the end of the final session, students are asked if they would like any additional information or assistance regarding nicotine cessation. Those who are of age are permitted to inquire into the various nicotine replacement therapy programs available.

Fixing Global Finance

Fixing Global Finance is a book written by Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf. It discusses the relationship between global imbalances and financial crises, and offers several personal proposals to restore economic balances.
Content.
In this book, Wolf argues that the subprime crisis is structurally comparable to the crisis of 1997 in Latin America, 1998 in Russia and 1999 in South-East Asia. This statement is based on the idea that there is a significant relationship between microeconomics of finance and the macroeconomics of the balance of payments. According to Wolf, this resulted in the United States becoming the "borrower and spender of last resort," thereby unbalancing global capital flows. Against this, Wolf proposes that global economic security depends on the ability of emerging economies to develop robust financial systems based on domestic currencies.

Parti Chevreuil

The Parti Chevreuil (which means "Deer Party") was a very short-lived Quebec provincial political party.
It gained official status in Quebec on June 20th 1994 after 15 months of work by its founders, seed grocer Mathieu Trudelle and teacher Charles Tardif, to harvest the 1,000 signatures necessary by electoral law. Trudelle, who was 20 years old at the time, had the idea while studying sociology at the Cegep de Sherbrooke and wanted to know how to create a new political party.
The name of the party came from several plays with words in French language, Trudelle having said that the deer was an animal who has "panache" (which means "class" in French but also is another word to qualify a deer's antlers) and who can cause "ravages" (which means trouble in French but also qualifies a herd of deers).
Not intended as a joke party like the Parti Rhinocéros or the Parti Citron despite its funny name, the Parti Chevreuil proposed cutting the MP's salaries from 73 000$ to 50 000$ and to put an end to their pension plans. They also wanted to give people easier access to hospital, create an environmental court, have recycling facilities all around Quebec and a create a bike trail all around Quebec. They were also in favor of the sovereignty of Quebec and planned to finance the party by selling membership cards and organizing shows.
The party planned to run candidates in between 20 and 30 ridings during for the Quebec general election, 1994. However, Chief Electoral Officer Pierre-F. Coté removed their official status on August 29th 1994 after failing to run more than 10 candidates for the upcoming election. Trudelle and Tardif didn't even run as independents.

Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus

The Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus () was a short-lived, self-governing entity founded in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars on February 28, 1914 by Greeks living in southern Albania (Northern Epirotes).
The area, known as "Northern Epirus" (Βόρειος Ήπειρος) to Greeks and with a substantial Greek population, was taken by the Greek Army during the First Balkan War (1912–1913). The Protocol of Florence however, had assigned it to the newly established Albanian state. This decision was rejected by the local Greeks, and as the Greek army withdrew to the new border, an autonomous government was set up at Argyrokastron (, today Gjirokastër), under the leadership of Georgios Christakis-Zografos, a distinguished local Greek politician and former Minister of Foreign Affairs, and with tacit support from Greece.
In May, the autonomy was confirmed by the Great Powers with the Protocol of Corfu. The agreement ensured that the region would have its own administration, recognized the rights of the local population and provided for self-government under nominal Albanian sovereignty. However, it was never implemented because in August the Albanian government collapsed. The Greek Army reoccupied the area in October 1914 following the outbreak of World War I. Northern Epirus was slated to be ceded to Greece following the war, but withdrawal of Italian support and Greece's defeat in the Asia Minor Campaign resulted in its final cession to Albania in November 1921.
Background.
Northern Epirus and the Balkan Wars.
In March 1913, during the First Balkan War, the Greek Army liberated Ioannina after breaching the Ottoman fortifications at Bizani, and soon afterwards advanced further north. Himarë had already been under Greek control since 5 November 1912, after a local Himariote, Gendarmerie Major Spyros Spyromilios, led a successful uprising that met no initial resistance. By the end of the war, Greek armed forces controlled most of the historical region of Epirus, from the Ceraunian mountains along the Ionian coast to Lake Prespa in the east.
At the same time, the Albanian independence movement gathered momentum. On 28 November 1912 in Vlorë, Ismail Qemali declared Albania's independence, and a provisional government was soon formed that exercised its authority only in the immediate area of Vlorë. Elsewhere, the Ottoman general Essad Pasha formed the Republic of Central Albania at Durrës, while conservative Albanian tribesmen still hoped for an Ottoman ruler. Most of the area that would form the Albanian state was occupied at this time, by the Greeks in the south and the Serbs in the north.
The last Ottoman census, conducted in 1908, counted 128,000 Orthodox Christians and 95,000 Muslims in the region. Of the Orthodox population, an estimated 30,000 to 47,000 spoke Greek exclusively. The rest of the Orthodox community spoke an Albanian patois at home, but was literate only in Greek, which was used in cultural, trading and economic activities. Moreover, they expressed a strong pro-Greek feeling, and were the first to support the following breakaway autonomist movement. Considering these conditions, loyalty in Northern Epirus to an Albanian government headed by a competing variety of exclusively Muslim leaders could not be guaranteed.
Delineation of the Greek–Albanian border.
The concept of an independent Albanian state was supported by the Great European Powers, particularly Austro-Hungary and Italy. Both powers were seeking to control Albania, which, in the words of Italian Foreign Minister Tommaso Tittoni, would give whichever managed this "incontestable supremacy in the Adriatic". The Serbian possession of Shkodër and the possibility of the Greek border running a few miles south of Vlore was therefore strongly resisted by these states.
On September 1913, an International Commission of the European Powers convened to determine the boundary between Greece and Albania. The delegates of the commission aligned themselves into two camps: those of Italy and Austro-Hungary insisted that the Northern Epirus districts were Albanian, while those of the Triple Entente (the United Kingdom, France, and Russia) took the view that although the older generations in some villages spoke Albanian, the younger generation was Greek in intellectual outlook, sentiment, and aspirations. Under Italian and Austro-Hungarian pressure, the commission determined that the region of Northern Epirus would be ceded to Albania.
Protocol of Florence.
With the delineation of the exact boundaries of the new state, the region of Northern Epirus was awarded to Albania under the terms of the Protocol of Florence, signed on 17 December 1913. On 21 February 1914, the ambassadors of the Great Powers delivered a note to the Greek government asking for the Greek army's evacuation of the area. Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos acceded to this in hopes of a favorable solution to Greece's other outstanding problem: the recognition of Greek sovereignty over the islands of the North Eastern Aegean.
Reactions.
Declaration of Independence.
This turn of events was highly unpopular among the pro-Greek party in the area. The pro-Greek Epirotes felt betrayed by the Greek government, which had done nothing to support them with firearms. Additionally, the gradual withdrawal of the Greek army would enable Albanian forces to take control of the region. To avert this possibility, the Epirotes decided to declare their own separate political identity and self-governance. Georgios Christakis-Zografos, a distinguished Epirote statesman from Lunxhëri (gr. "Lioúntzi") and former Greek foreign minister, took the initiative and discussed the situation with local representatives in a "Panepirotic Council". Consequently, on 28 February 1914, the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was declared in Gjirokastër (gr. "Argyrókastron") and a provisional government, with Christakis-Zografos as president, formed to support the state's objectives.
The flag of the new state was a variant of the Greek national flag, consisting of a white cross centered upon the blue background surmounted by the imperial Byzantine eagle in black.
In the following days, Alexandros Karapanos, Zografos' nephew and a MP for Arta, was installed as foreign minister. Colonel Dimitrios Doulis, a local from Nivice, resigned from his post in the Greek army and joined the provisional government as minister of military affairs. Within a few days, he managed to mobilize an army consisting of more than 5,000 volunteer troops. The local bishop, Vasileios of Dryinoupolis, took office as minister of Religion and Justice. A number of officers of Epirote origin (not exceeding 30), as well as ordinary soldiers, deserted their positions in the Greek Army and joined the revolutionaries. Soon, armed groups, such as the "Sacred Band" or Spyromilios' men around Himarë (gr. "Himárra"), were formed in order to repel any incursion into the territory claimed by the autonomous government. The first districts to join the autonomist movement outside of Gjirokastër were Himarë, Sarandë and Përmet.
Greece’s reaction and evacuation.
The Greek government was reluctant to overtly support the uprising. Military and political officials continued to carry out a slow evacuation process, which had begun in March and ended on 28 April. Resistance was officially discouraged, and assurances were given that the Great Powers and the International Control Commission (an organization founded by the Great Powers in order to secure peace and stability in the area) would guarantee their rights. Following the declaration in Gjirokastër, Zografos sent messages to local representatives in Korçë (gr. "Korytsá") asking them to join the movement; however, the Greek military commander of the city, Colonel Alexandros Kontoulis, followed his official orders strictly and declared martial law, threatening to shoot any citizen raising the Northern Epirote flag. When the local bishop of Kolonjë (gr. Kolónia), Spyridon, proclaimed the Autonomy, Kontoulis had him immediately arrested and expelled.
On March 1, Kontoulis ceded the region to the newly formed Albanian gendarmerie, consisting mainly of former deserters of the Ottoman army and under the command of Dutch and Austrian officers. On March 9, the Greek navy blockaded the port of Sarandë (gr. "Ágioi Saránda", known also as "Santi Quaranta"), one of the first cities that had joined the autonomist movement. There were also sporadic conflicts between Greek army and Epirote units, with a few casualties on both sides.
Negotiations and armed conflicts.
As the Greek army withdrew, armed conflicts broke out between Albanian and Northern Epirote forces. In the regions of Himarë, Sarandë, Gjirokastër and Delvinë (gr. "Delvínion"), the revolt had been in full force since the first days of the declaration, and the autonomist forces were able to successfully engage the Albanian gendarmerie, as well as Albanian irregular units. However, Zografos, seeing that the Great Powers would not approve the annexation of Northern Epirus to Greece, suggested three possible diplomatic solutions:
On March 7, Prince William of Wied arrived in Albania, and intense fighting occurred north of Gjirokastër, in the region of Cepo, in an attempt to take control over Northern Epirus; Albanian gendarmerie units tried unsuccessfully to infiltrate southwardly, facing resistance from the Epirotes. On March 11, a provisional settlement was brokered in Corfu by Dutch Colonel Thomson. Albania was prepared to accept a limited Northern Epirote government, but Karapanos insisted on complete autonomy, a condition rejected by the Albanian delegates, and negotiations reached a deadlock. Meanwhile, Epirote bands entered Erseka and continued on to Frashër and Korçë.
At this point, the entire region that had been claimed by the provisional government, with the exception of Korçë, was under its control. On March 22, a Sacred Band unit from Bilisht reached the outskirts of Korçë and joined the local guerillas, and fierce street fighting took place. For several days, Northern Epirote units controlled the city, but on March 27 this control was lost to the Albanian gendarmerie upon the arrival of Albanian reinforcements.
The International Control Commission, in order to avoid a major escalation of the armed conflicts with disastrous results, decided to intervene. On May 6, Zografos received a communication to initiate negotiations on a new basis. Zografos accepted the proposal and an armistice was ordered the next day. By the time the cease-fire order was received, the Epirote forces had secured the Morava heights near Korçë, making the city's Albanian garrison's surrender imminent.
Recognition of autonomy and outbreak of World War I.
Protocol of Corfu.
Negotiations were carried out on the island of Corfu, where on 17 May 1914 Albanian and Epirote representatives signed an agreement known as the Protocol of Corfu. According to its terms, the two provinces of Korçë and Gjirokastër that constituted Northern Epirus would acquire complete autonomous existence (as a "corpus separatum") under the nominal Albanian sovereignty of Prince Wied. The Albanian government had the right to appoint and dismiss governors and upper-rank officials, taking into account as much as possible the opinion of the local population. Other terms included the proportional recruitment of natives into the local gendarmerie and the prohibition of military levies from people not indigenous to the region. In Orthodox schools, the Greek language would be the sole medium of instruction, with the exception of the first three classes. The use of the Greek language was made equal to Albanian in all public affairs. The Ottoman-era privileges of Himarë were renewed, and a foreigner was to be appointed as its "captain" for 10 years.
The execution of and adherence to the Protocol was entrusted to the International Control Commission, as was the organization of public administration and the departments of justice and finance in the region. The creation and training of the local gendarmerie was to be conducted by Dutch officers.
The agreement of the Protocol was ratified by the representatives of the Great Powers at Athens on 18 June and by the Albanian government on 23 June. The Epirote representatives, in an assembly in Delvinë, gave the final approval to the terms of the Protocol, although the delegates from Himara protested, claiming that union with Greece was the only viable solution. On July 8, control of the cities of Tepelenë and Korçë passed to the provisional government of Northern Epirus.
Instability and disestablishment.
After the outbreak of World War I, the situation in Albania became unstable, and political chaos emerged as the country was split into a number of regional governments. As a consequence of the anarchy in central and northern Albania, sporadic armed conflicts continued to occur in spite of the Protocol of Corfu's ratification, and on September 3 Prince Wilhelm departed the country. In the following days, an Epirote unit launched an attack on the Albanian garrison in Berat without approval from the provisional government, managing to capture its citadel for several days, while Albanian troops loyal to Essad Pasha initiated small-scale armed operations.
These events worried Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, as well as the possibility that the unstable situation could spill over outside Albania, triggering a wider conflict. On 27 October, after receiving the approval of the Great Powers, the Greek Army's V Army Corps entered the area for a second time. The provisional government formally ceased to exist, declaring that it had accomplished its objectives.
Aftermath.
Greek administration (October 1914–September 1916).
During the Greek administration at the time of the First World War, it had been agreed to by Greece, Italy and the Great Powers that the final settlement of the Northern Epirote issue would be left for the post-war future. In August 1915, Eleftherios Venizelos stated in the Greek parliament that "only colossal faults" could separate the region from Greece. Upon Venizelos' resignation in December, however, the succeeding royalist governments were determined to exploit the situation and predetermine the region's future by formally incorporating it into the Greek state. In the first months of 1916, Northern Epirus participated in the Greek elections and elected 16 representatives to the Greek Parliament. In March, the region's union with Greece was officially declared, and the area was divided into the prefectures of Argyrokastro and Korytsa.
Italian–French occupation and Interwar period.
The politically unstable situation that followed in Greece during the next months, with the National Schism between royalists and Venizelos’ supporters, divided Greece into two states. This situation, according also to the development of the Balkan Front, led Italian forces in Gjirokastër to enter the area in September 1916, after gaining the approval of the Triple Entente, and to take over most of Northern Epirus. An exception was Korçë which was retaken by French forces from Bulgarian occupation, and turned into the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë under the military protection of the French army. After the war's end in 1918, the tendency to reestablish the autonomy of the region continued.
Under the terms of the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 (the Venizelos-Tittoni agreement), Northern Epirus was to be awarded to Greece, but political developments such as the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) and strong Italian opposition in favor of Albania caused the area to be finally ceded to Albania in 1921.
In February 1922, the Albanian Parliament approved the Declaration of Minority Rights. However, the Declaration, contrary to the Protocol of Corfu, recognized minority rights only in a limited area (parts of Gjirokastër, Sarandë district and 3 villages in Himarë), without implementing any form of local autonomy. All Greek schools in the excluded area were forced to close until 1935, in violation of obligations accepted by the Albanian government at the League of Nations. In 1925, Albania's present borders were set, leading Greece to abandon its claims to Northern Epirus.
The Northern Epirote issue and the autonomy question.
From the Albanian perspective, adopted also by Italian and Austrian sources of that time, the Northern Epirote movement was directly supported by the Greek state, with the help of a minority of inhabitants in the region, resulting in chaos and political instability in all of Albania. In Albanian historiography, the Protocol of Corfu is either scarcely mentioned or seen as an attempt to divide the Albanian state and proof of the Great Powers' disregard for Albania's national integrity.
With the ratification of the Protocol of Corfu, the term "Northern Epirus", the state’s common name—and consequently that of its citizens, "Northern Epirotes"—acquired official status. However, after the region's cession to Albania, these terms were considered associated with Greek irredentist action and not granted legal status by the Albanian authorities; anyone making use of them was persecuted as an enemy of the state.
The autonomy question remains on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations as part of the Northern Epirote issue. In 1925, Albania's borders were fixed by the Protocol of Florence, and the Kingdom of Greece abandoned all claims to Northern Epirus. In 1991, after the collapse of the communist regime in Albania, the chairman of Greek minority organization "Omonoia" called for autonomy for Northern Epirus, on the basis that the rights provided for under the Albanian constitution were highly precarious. This proposal was rejected, spurring the minority's radical wing to call for a union with Greece. Two years later, Omonoia’s chairman was arrested by the Albanian police after publicly stating that the Greek minority goal was the creation of an autonomous region inside the Albanian borders, based on the provisions of the Protocol of Corfu. In 1997, Albanian analysts stated that the possibility of a Greek minority-inspired breakaway Republic still exists.

Adèle Isaac

Adèle Isaac (8 January 1854 – 22 October 1915) was a French operatic soprano, active in Paris in the late 19th century.
Isaac was born in Calais. After studying with Gilbert Duprez, her professional debut was in 1870 in Victor Massé's "Les noces de Jeannette" at the Théatre Montmartre. In February 1873 she attracted attention singing the young shepherd in "Tannhäuser" at La Monnaie (Bruxelles). Her first performance at the Opéra-Comique was in 1873 as Marie in "La fille du régiment", going on to sing Mozart and Gounod. On 3 April 1882 she sang Angèle in the 1,000th performance of "Le Domino Noir" at the Opéra-Comique. 
From 1883 to 1885 she appeared at the Opéra as Ophélia, Marguerite, Adele, Zerlina and Marguerite de Valois.
She sang in the first Paris revival of "Carmen" in April 1883, and was chosen for the more restrained, even bland interpretation of the title role she offered.
She created the roles of Olympia and Antonia in "Les contes d'Hoffmann" in 1881, Claire in "Egmont" by Salvayre in 1886, and Minka in "Le roi malgré lui" in 1887. Isaac was a great favourite at the Opéra-Comique: she sang Susanna in the 1882, 1886 and 1892 revivals of "Le Nozze di Figaro". Her absence for a concert tour in Rome and Monte Carlo in early 1888 delayed repeat performances of "Le roi malgré lui", and may have contributed to the end of its first run.
In 1884 Adèle Isaac sang in the annual performances of Beethoven's 9th Symphony given at the Société des Concerts du Conservatoire; the following year she sang music from "Egmont" and "The Magic Flute" with the same orchestra.
In 1887 she married businessman Charles Lelong; she retired in 1894. She died in Paris.

Unequal Childhoods

Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race, and Family Life is a 2003 non-fiction book by American author Annette Lareau based upon a study of 88 African American and white families (of which only 12 were discussed) to understand the impact of how social class makes a difference in family life, more specifically in children's lives. The book argues that regardless of race, social economic class will determine how children cultivate skills they will use in the future. In the second edition, Lareau revisits the subjects from the original study a decade later in order to examine the impact of social class on the transition to adulthood. She covers the subjects awareness of their social class,high school experiences and the effect of organized activities as they went through their adolescent years. She emphasizes the use of concerted cultivation and natural growth as tools parents in different social and economic classes use in order to raise their children and by continuing her research ten years later she is able to show how these methods of child rearing helped to cultivate the children into the adults they are today.
After her initial fieldwork was completed, Lareau returned to the families featured in her book to examine the pathways each of their lives had followed and to determine if her original research conclusions that class influences educational and work outcomes held true. In most cases, they did. The majority of the poorer, working class participants had either dropped out of high school or not attended post-secondary instititutions, or if they had, had not completed their courses. Many were working in jobs that did not require a college degree and had already been working full-time for several years, some had children and car payments to support. Some even gave money back to their parents as rent, for example, if they still lived at home. This made them appear older than the middle class participants who generally had less work experience, and the majority of whom had attended college after going through an extensive preparatory process of investigating various institutions and receiving much greater support and involvement of their parents in making their decision, both about the college to attend and the courses to take. The middle class youth were more likely to be in courses that would lead to professional type occupations like business, medicine and law.
Lareau found her earlier conclusions remained true: social class and parenting approaches significantly impacted educational and work outcomes. Middle-class families had financial and knowledge resources that working-class families did not and that was most visible as students worked their way through high school either successfully or not, and even more so when it came time to make decisions about attending college, what institution to attend and what courses to take. Middle-class parents took a different approach to interventions in their children’s lives than working-class parents and continued to play this support role and supervise as their children aged whereas working-class parents tended to stop once their children were 16–18 years old and it was felt they were old enough to make their own decisions. Lareau comments in a lecture captured on YouTube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xq_iCMgP2Q that, “their lives had diverged in a profound way.” Unequal Childhoods encourages us to better understand the impact social class has on our educational and life choices as such decisions as who we will marry, where we will live and how we find jobs are influenced by social class and the advantages it may or may not bring.
Methodology.
Lareau and her graduate researchers followed these families around in their daily lives. They attended sporting events, spent the night in the family's home, and attended a doctor's visit to observe the differences between the working- and lower-class families, and middle-class families. During her observations, she notices two different parenting styles.
In her follow-up with families ten years later, Lareau admits that the ideal study would have involved on-going participant observation, but that was not feasible given the resources and time investment of the families that would have required. Instead, she conducted two hour recorded interviews with each of the twelve children, and had separate interviews with each of the mothers, fathers and siblings that agreed to be interviewed. Some declined.
In response to the second edition of the book, critics continue to comment on the limitations of this study given its small sample size, while applying broad theoretical conclusions to North American society. Lareau briefly addresses race factors having an influence on outcomes for youth, but claims the class factors play a more significant role.
Parenting Styles.
Annette Lareau distinguishes between two different parenting styles: Concerted Cultivation and the Accomplishment of Natural Growth. 
Concerted Cultivation: The parenting style, favored by middle-class families, in which parents encourage negotiation and discussion and the questioning of authority, and enroll their children in extensive organized activity participation. This style helps children in middle-class careers, teaches them to question people in authority, develops a large vocabulary, and makes them comfortable in discussions with people of authority. However, it gives the children a sense of entitlement. 
Accomplishment of Natural Growth: The parenting style, favored by working-class and lower-class families, in which parents issue directives to their children rather than negotiations, encourage the following and trusting of people in authority positions, and do not structure their children's daily activities, but rather let the children play on their own. This method has benefits that prepare the children for a job in the "working" or "poor-class" jobs, teaches the children to respect and take the advice of people in authority, and allows the children to become independent at a younger age.

Skorpiovenator

Skorpiovenator is a genus of abelisaurid theropod dinosaur from the late Cretaceous period of Argentina.
Description.
"Skorpiovenator" could grow up to in length and weighed . It had short, stubby, near-useless arms, but strong legs with powerful thighs and sturdy shins over which its large body was balanced.
Skull.
"Skorpiovenator"'s skull short, stout and was covered in ridges, furrows, tubercles and bumpy nodules that are scattered over the heads of most abelisaurid theropods. Its slender jaws housed rows of razor-sharp teeth. Skorpiovenator may not have had a large bite force, as has been suggested for some other abelisaurids. Skorpiovenator may have used its deep skull as a club, arching its head back and swinging it down onto its prey to drive the teeth home with enough force to do some serious damage to its prey. 
Discovery and naming.
The type specimen was described and named by Canale, Scanferla, Agnolin, and Novas in 2009 (though the paper was released as an advanced publication online in 2008). The name "Skorpiovenator bustingorryi" is derived from the Greek and Latin for "scorpion hunter," due to the abundant scorpions present at the dig site, and the specific name honors Manuel Bustingorry, who owned the farm where the specimen was found. The describers have defined a new name Brachyrostra for a clade, to which "Skorpiovenator" belonged.
The type species, "Skorpiovenator bustingorryi", is known from a single, nearly complete skeleton (MMCH-PV 48K) missing only sections of the tail and the majority of the forelimbs. The specimen was recovered from the lower part of the Huincul Formation in Patagonia, dating to the late Cenomanian stage, about 95 million years ago. It would have lived alongside other carnivorous dinosaurs such as the carcharodontosaurid "Mapusaurus" and another abelisaurid, "Ilokelesia".
Phylogeny.
In 2008, Canale "et al." published a phylogenetic analysis focusing on the South American carnotaurines. In their results, they found that all South American forms (including "Skorpiovenator") grouped together as a sub-clade of Carnotaurinae, which they named Brachyrostra, meaning "short snouts." They defined the clade Brachyrostra as "all the abelisaurids more closely related to "Carnotaurus sastrei" than to "Majungasaurus crenatissimus"."

FU Orionis

FU Orionis is a variable star in the constellation of Orion, that in 1937 rose in apparent visual magnitude from 16.5 to 9.6, and has since been around magnitude 9. For a long time it was considered unique, but in 1970 a similar star, V1057 Cygni, was discovered, and a number of additional examples have been discovered since then. These stars constitute the FU Orionis class of variable stars, GCVS type "FU", often nicknamed "FUors". These stars are pre–main sequence stars which display an extreme change in magnitude and spectral type.

Darlton Gliding Club

Darlton Gliding Club (DGC) is a gliding club located in Nottinghamshire near the village of Tuxford. 
History.
Darlton Gliding Club was formed during June 2007 by the merger of the former Newark and Notts Gliding Club and the Dukeries Gliding Club when both of these clubs lost use of their airfields. Darlton is now the only gliding club in the county of Nottinghamshire. The Dukeries club had been based at Gamston but when they lost the use of this site they were able to acquire the land at Darlton. Subsequently the Newark and Notts club lost the use of their airfield at Winthorpe when the adjoining showground did not renew the lease. After a short period of ground-sharing a formal decision was made to merge the two clubs into one and the new Darlton Gliding Club was formed.
Initially there were no facilities on site - gliders were rigged and derigged each day - so the priority was to erect a hangar. A portacabin was also installed to act as a clubhouse. Much work has been put into improving the grass, and it is now able to support year round operations. Over the last 3 years club members have erected a second hangar and the original portacabin has been replaced with a new club house which was officially opened in April 2011.
The runway is oriented 05/23 (into the prevailing wind) and the area offers good soaring opportunities. Soaring flights have been achieved in every month from February through to November.
Operations.
The club is run on a non-commercial basis by the members for the members. All non-flying activities are shared on a voluntary basis.
Launching takes place using a winch. 
At present aerotows are not possible due to planning restrictions, however motor glider operations are permissible and a group of members have a Falke motor glider based on the site.
Club Fleet.
The current active fleet consists of:

<doc id="20603860" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20603860" title="Sex industry">
Sex industry

The sex industry (also called the sex trade) consists of businesses which either directly or indirectly provide sex-related products and services or adult entertainment. Sex-related products and services such as prostitution, pornography, sex-oriented men's magazines, sex movies, sex toys and fetish and BDSM paraphernalia, and sex channels for television and pre-paid sex movies for "on demand", are part of the sex industry, as are adult movie theaters, sex shops, and strip clubs.
Prostitution.
Prostitution is a main component of the sex industry, and may take place in a brothel, at a facility provided by the prostitute, at a client's hotel room, in a parked car, or on the street. Often this is arranged through a pimp or an escort agency. This activity involves a prostitute or sex worker providing sexual services to a client (also called a john). In some cases the prostitute is at liberty to determine whether she or he will engage in a particular type of sexual activity, but forced prostitution exists all around the world as does sexual slavery.
The legality of prostitution and associated activities (soliciting, brothels, procuring) varies by jurisdiction. And yet even where it is illegal there is usually a thriving underground business because of high demand and the booming revenue that can be made by pimps, brothel owners, escort agencies, and traffickers. Also, establishments such as massage parlors, bars or strip clubs may offer sexual services to patrons.
Other participants.
The sex industry employs hundreds of people each day. These range from the sex worker, also called adult service provider (ASP) or adult sex provider, who provides sexual services, to a multitude of support personnel. Sex workers can be prostitutes, call girls, pornographic film actors, pornographic models, sex show performers, erotic dancers, striptease dancers, bikini baristas, telephone sex operators, cybersex operators, or amateur porn stars for online sex sessions and videos.
In addition, like any other industry, there are people who work in or service the sex industry as managers, film crews, photographers, website developers and webmasters, sales personnel, book and magazine writers and editors, etc. Some create business models, negotiate trade, make press releases, draw up contracts with other owners, buy and sell content, offer technical support, run servers, billing services, or payroll, organise trade shows and various events, do marketing and sales forecasts, provide human resources, or provide tax services and legal support.
Usually, those in management or staff do not have direct dealings with sex workers, instead hiring photographers who have direct contact with the sex workers. Pornography is professionally marketed and sold to adult webmasters for distribution on the Internet.
Pornography.
Pornography is the portrayal of explicit sexual subject matter for the purposes of sexual arousal and erotic satisfaction. A "pornographic model" poses for pornographic photographs. A "pornographic actor" or "porn star" performs in pornographic films. In cases where limited dramatic skills are involved, a performer in pornographic films may be called a "pornographic model". Porn can be provided to the consumer in a variety of media, ranging from books, magazines, postcards, photos, sculpture, drawing, painting, animation, sound recording, film, video, or video game. However, when sexual acts are performed for a live audience, by definition it is not pornography, as the term applies to the depiction of the act, rather than the act itself. Thus, portrayals such as sex shows and striptease are not classified as pornography.
The first home-PCs capable of network communication prompted the arrival of online services for adults in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The wide-open early days of the World Wide Web quickly snowballed into the dot-com boom, in-part fueled by an incredible global increase in the demand for and consumption of pornography and erotica.
Sex tourism.
Both men and women travel away from their home to engage in sex tourism, though the pattern of attraction tends to differ between them. Male sex tourism can create or augment demand for sex services in the host countries, while female sex tourism tends not to use existing sex facilities. Like tourism in general, sex tourism can make a significant contribution to local economies, especially in popular urban centers. Sex tourism may arise as a result of stringent anti-prostitution laws in a tourist's home country, but can create social problems in the host country.
Location.
Businesses that provide sex services tend to cluster around military bases. The British naval port of Portsmouth had a flourishing local sex industry in the 19th century, and until the early 1990s there were large red light districts near American military bases in the Philippines. The Monto red-light district of Dublin, one of the largest in Europe, gained most of its custom from the British soldiers stationed in the city; indeed it collapsed after Irish independence was achieved and the soldiers left. The notorious Patpong entertainment district in Bangkok, and the city of Pattaya, Thailand, started as R&R locations for US troops serving in the Vietnam War in the early 1970s. Sex industries are also small but growing in several college towns.
Use of children.
While the legality of adult sexual entertainment varies by country, the use of children in the sex industry is illegal nearly everywhere in the world.
Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) is the "sexual abuse by the adult and remuneration in cash or kind to the child or a third person or persons. The child is treated as a sexual object and as a commercial object".
CSEC includes the prostitution of children, child pornography, child sex tourism and other forms of transactional sex where a child engages in sexual activities to have key needs fulfilled, such as food, shelter or access to education. It includes forms of transactional sex where the sexual abuse of children is not stopped or reported by household members, due to benefits derived by the household from the perpetrator. CSEC is prevalent in Asia (Thailand, Cambodia, India) and parts of Latin America. Thailand, Cambodia, India, Brazil and Mexico have been identified as leading hotspots of commercial sexual exploitation of children.
Opposition.
The sex industry is very controversial, and many people, organizations and governments have strong moral objections to it, and, as a result, pornography, prostitution, striptease and other similar occupations are illegal in many countries.
The term anti-pornography movement is used to describe those who argue that pornography has a variety of harmful effects on society, such as encouragement of human trafficking, desensitization, pedophilia, dehumanization, exploitation, sexual dysfunction, and inability to maintain healthy sexual relationships.
Sociological objections.
Dolf Zillmann asserts that extensive viewing of pornographic material produces many sociological effects which he characterizes as unfavorable, including a decreased respect for long-term, monogamous relationships, and an attenuated desire for procreation. He claims that pornography can "potentially undermine the traditional values that favor marriage, family, and children" and that it depicts sexuality in a way which is not connected to "emotional attachment, of kindness, of caring, and especially not of continuance of the relationship, as such continuance would translate into responsibilities"
Additionally, some researchers claim that pornography causes unequivocal harm to society by increasing rates of sexual assault, a line of research which has been critiqued in "The effects of Pornography: An International Perspective" on external validity grounds, while others claim there is a correlation between pornography and a decrease of sex crimes.
Feminist objections.
Some feminists object to the sex industry, which they argue is exploitative to the women who work in it. They say it contributes to the male-centered objectification of women, increases sexual violence against women, and undermines gender equality. They argue that prostitution is a form of male domination and violence against women, and that in most cases it is not a conscious and calculated choice. They say that most women who become prostitutes do so because they were forced or coerced into it by a pimp or other human trafficker, or by circumstances such as extreme poverty, lack of opportunity, drug addiction, homelessness, and childhood sexual abuse.
Based on these arguments, Sweden, Norway and Iceland have criminalized the buying of sexual services, while decriminalizing the selling of sexual services. (In other words, clients and pimps can be prosecuted for moneyed sexual transactions, but not prostitutes). These laws have greatly reduced illegal prostitution and human trafficking in these countries.
Some feminists, such as Gail Dines, are opposed to pornography, arguing that it is an industry which exploits women and which is complicit in violence against women, both in its production (where they charge that abuse and exploitation of women performing in pornography is rampant) and in its consumption (where they charge that pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in rape and sexual harassment). They charge that pornography contributes to the male-centered objectification of women and thus to sexism. However, other feminists are opposed to censorship, and have argued against the introduction of anti-porn legislation in the United States - among them Betty Friedan, Kate Millett, Karen DeCrow, Wendy Kaminer and Jamaica Kincaid.
Other objections.
The sex industry often raises criticism because it is sometimes connected to criminal activities such as human trafficking, illegal immigration, drug abuse, and exploitation of children (child pornography, child prostitution). The sex industry also raises concerns about the spread of STDs.

Bill Paparian

Bill Paparian (born 1949 in Los Angeles, California) is an American politician, a former mayor of Pasadena, California, serving from 1995 to 1997. He was also a member of the Pasadena City Council from 1987 to 1999, and a Green Party candidate for Congress in 2006. He was the first Armenian-American mayor of Pasadena, as well as the only Pasadena mayor to visit Cuba during his term. Paparian has been known throughout his political career as an outspoken advocate of controversial causes, including ending the trade embargo against Cuba. He attracted national media attention for dispatching a Pasadena police helicopter to issue a citation to state aircraft spraying pesticides over the city, and for his urging Rose Parade observers in 2008 to turn their backs on the Chinese float, which he called the "Beijing Float of Shame."
Early years.
Paparian was raised in the Sherman Oaks section of the San Fernando Valley in the 1960s. He is the son of an Armenian immigrant mother and second generation Armenian-Irish-American father from Rhode Island. Paparian received his B.A. degree from California State University Northridge and later received his law degree from Southwestern University School of Law. While attending California State University Northridge, he was a theater student who also protested the Vietnam War. Yet, he joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1971 and was stationed at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County during the final years of the war. Years later, as Mayor of Pasadena, he was awarded the Outstanding Military Volunteer Service Medal by the Secretary of the Navy for his efforts as an elected public official on behalf of the military and veterans.
After being discharged from the Marine Corps, Paparian attended Southwestern University School of Law on the G.I. Bill and became an attorney. As a young attorney, he helped gain a medical furlough for Gourgen Yanikian, an Armenian immigrant convicted in the 1973 assassination of two Turkish diplomats, and defended Harry M. Sassounian, a Pasadena man found guilty in the fatal 1982 shooting of a Turkish consul.
He first achieved notoriety in 1987, when he unexpectedly unseated former Mayor Jo Heckman for her seat on the Board of City Directors, when her reelection was considered to be a safe bet.
Reputation for independence.
Paparian has been known throughout his political career for a "go-it-alone" streak. In 1997, the "Los Angeles Times" published a profile of Paparian, focusing on his independence and penchant for attracting controversy. The "Times" noted:"To detractors, his antics have undercut some otherwise good works and tarred Pasadena's stately image. The controversies also have underlined the sometimes puzzling complexities of a former Republican (now an independent) who admires both leftist revolutionary Che Guevara and the U.S. Marine Corps, who speaks out on Cuba and for the rights of American gun owners like himself. Paparian's views may seem an incongruous marriage of right and left, but his friends say they mark an independent-minded populist who favors the underdog and answers no clarion but his own."
Paparian suggested that his advocacy for unpopular causes was the product of "an intolerance for intolerance" and his upbringing in a family of Armenian immigrants.
Cuban relations.
Paparian known for his efforts to normalize relations between the United States and Cuba. As Mayor of Pasadena, he convened a conference on U.S.-Cuba relations at Occidental College that was co-sponsored by the United Nations Association and the Department of Diplomacy and World Affairs. Paparian has traveled frequently to Cuba to coordinate the delivery of medical supplies and equipment and has worked with the Cuban Council of Churches and Havana’s pediatric hospitals.
In July 1996, Paparian visited Cuba with his family in a trip paid for by the Cuban government. Paparian "received accolades and applause" in Cuba for his urging the U.S. government to end the trade embargo against Cuba. However, his visit led to criticism back in Pasadena. Upon his return from Cuba, more than 300 people crowded into a City Council meeting, some supporting and others opposing Paparian's trip.
Criticism of China.
Paparian has also been an outspoken critic of the People's Republic of China. In July 1996, Mayor Paparian welcomed the Dalai Lama to City Hall and presented him with a key to the city, ignoring concerns expressed by the State Department and the government of the People’s Republic of China, that there could be dire consequences for the relationship between the United States and China. In December 2007, when Pasadena Mayor Bill Bogaard referred to China's human rights abuses in China “allegations,” and invited China to enter a float in Pasadena's annual Rose Parade, Paparian wrote an article in the "Pasadena Weekly" urging parade observers to "Turn your backs on Bogaard’s Beijing Float of Shame!"
Armenian activism.
As an Armenian-American, Paparian has also spoken out about the Armenian Genocide. In April 1996, he was the keynote speaker at a ceremony attended by Elizabeth Dole and 7,000 others, remembering the genocide; the ceremony was held at the Armenian Martyrs Monument in Montebello, California. In his keynote address, Paparian noted: "Every year, we come to this hallowed site to honor the memory of our 1.5 million martyrs. Armenians the world over do the same on this day, each and every Armenian honoring our collective loss. But, we also know that the Genocide is not over. It continues silently, relentlessly, insidiously. The scars are not healed. The wounds are still festering, and the suffering is real." In 1989, Paparian led the effort to declare Byurakan, Pasadena's fourth Sister City. When a Genocide Resolution was defeated in the U.S. Congress in 2007, Paparian called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi under the Freedom of Information Act to release all records regarding the Genocide Resolution including records of meetings with representatives of the Turkish government. Paparian noted, "For too long, the leadership of the Democratic Party has played the Armenian-American community on recognition of the Armenian Genocide of 1915."
Other issues.
In what the "Los Angeles Times" called "one of his best-known moments," Paparian led Pasadena's opposition to the state's use of helicopters to spray pesticides to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly. Paparian received national media attention when he passed an ordiance outlawing formation-flying at low altitudes, and dispatched a Pasadena police helicopter to issue a citation to the state's pesticide-spraying aircraft.
In 1996, Paparian, then serving as Pasadena's Mayor, drew fire over a fund-raising "smoker" he hosted on the Rose Bowl's turf. Participants paid $110 each to smoke cigars with the Mayor, drawing criticism from anti-smoking advocates.
In 1997, Paparian became engaged in a legal battle with the Pasadena Star News. The paper published a front-page story on Paparian's personal financial troubles on the day of the 1996 UCLA-USC football game. Paparian sued the paper, charging that the reporter had used confidential credit records in an effort to embarrass him. The lawsuit was dismissed in February 1997.
Paparian has also been an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War and, in 2006, called on the California legislature to support and pass AJR 39, a California resolution calling for impeachment proceedings against George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.

Microalloyed steel

Microalloyed steel is a type of alloy steel that contains small amounts of alloying elements (0.05 to 0.15%). Standard alloying elements include: niobium, vanadium, titanium, molybdenum, zirconium, boron, and rare-earth metals. They are used to refine the grain microstructure and/or facilitate precipitation hardening.
These steels lie, in terms of performance and cost, between carbon steel and low alloy steel. Yield strength is between without heat treatment. Weldability is good, and can even be improved by reducing carbon content while maintaining strength. Fatigue life and wear resistance are superior to similar heat treated steels. The disadvantages are that ductility and toughness are not as good as quenched and tempered (Q&T) steels. They must also be heated hot enough for the all of the alloys to be in solution; after forming the material must be quickly cooled to .
Cold worked microalloyed steels do not require as much cold working to achieve the same strength as other carbon steel; this also leads to greater ductility. Hot worked microalloyed steels can be used from the air-cooled state. If controlled cooling is used, the material can produce mechanical properties similar to Q&T steels. Machinability is better than Q&T steels because of their more uniform hardness and their ferrite-pearlite microstructure.
Because microalloyed steels are not quenched and tempered they are not susceptible to quench cracking, nor do they need to be straightened or stress relieved. However, because of this they are through hardened and do not have a softer and tougher core like quench and tempered steels.

Rock House Reservation

The Rock House Reservation is a open space preserve located in West Brookfield, Massachusetts. The property, acquired in 1993 by the land conservation non-profit organization The Trustees of Reservations, is named for a natural rock shelter once used as a winter camp by Native Americans.Its location near two, long Native American footpaths suggests that it may also have been a trail camp and meeting place.
The Rock House Reservation is located off Massachusetts Route 9 and offers of hiking trails, an interpretive center, a butterfly garden, and scenic vistas. Boulder strewn Carter Pond occupies the center of the property. The reservation is open to hiking, picnicking, and cross country skiing. Horseback riding and mountain biking are allowed on certain parts of the property.
History.
During the last ice age when the southern movement of the Wisconsin Glacier transformed the landscape producing unique rock formations and outcroppings. Today two glacially formed outcroppings are still present on the property. These formations are known as Balance Rock and the Rock House Shelter. After the ice age, archaeologists believe Native Americans used the Rock House Shelter as a winter camp, trail camp and/or meeting place.
In the mid 17th century, the forests of West Brookfield were cleared by colonists for farming. In 1866, pastures around the Rock House were added to a 281-acre farm on Ragged Hill Road owned by William Adams whose family would tend the land for more than 125 years. During the first two decades of the 20th Century, Rock House was a popular stop on the "Copper Line", an electric trolley that ran between West Brookfield and Ware.
Visitors came to picnic in the abandoned pastures and explore this historic Native American landmark. Later the area was used as a country retreat by Arthur Carter, a family descendant of the Adams who owned the land since the mid-1800s. Arthur built a small cabin in 1930, today’s Trailside Museum, and created Carter Pond by building an earthen dam. The property was gifted to The Trustees of Reservations in 1993.
It is located next to the birthplace of suffragist Lucy Stone.
Ownership History.
The Rock House Reservation was an anonymous gift, with endowment, in 1993 in memory of William Adams. Additional land was then purchased in 2002. The Rock House Reservation began with the gift of a conservation restriction to The Trustees of Reservations by an anonymous donor in 1977 followed by a donation of the fee interest in 1993, in memory of William Adams. The reservation was expanded by 58 acres in 2002 with the addition of 50 acres on the Reservation’s western border, which had been acquired from John Cregan and Donald Richards, and an additional 8 acres, west of the Cregan and Richards parcel, from Maurice Labbe.
Natural Resources.
The Rock House reservation is located in the Lower Worcester Plateau/Eastern Connecticut Upland Ecoregion. Elevations at the Rock House range between 600 feet near its lowest elevation to more than 1,020 feet at its highest which makes up nearly the full range of elevation for the ecoregion. Rock outcrops and large surface boulders are common, and most are covered with lichens and ferns. The outcrop that gives the Reservation its name is among the largest and most dramatic.
Post agricultural second-growth mixed forest and conifer plantations cover much of the eastern half of the Reservation while an oak dominated forest, possibly containing primary forest, covers the western half. Carter’s Pond is a primary scenic feature near the center of the property. The two and a half acre pond is very shallow and was created in the 1920s or 1930s. A power line also bisects the Reservation creating early successional habitat. Several intermittent streams flow through the property, flowing south towards Route 9 and the Ware River. Woodland vernal pools are uncommon.
Carter Pond.
Carter Pond is a relatively shallow pond, with an area of about 2.5 acres and a watershed of about 8 acres. The pond has a healthy riparian zone (characterized by woody trees and shrubs) and healthy shoreline vegetation (characterized by sedges, grasses, rushes). Both of these areas provide important habitat for dragonflies, damselflies, mammals and amphibians.
The pond has an average depth of 1 meter and soft substrate that is characterized by inorganic sediment and undecomposed organic matter. Sunlight reaches the bottom of the substrate 40% of the time. The pond has a healthy pH and alkalinity, low levels of nitrates, phosphates and dissolved oxygen and high levels of suspended solids. Biologically, there is a high diversity of macroinvertebrate and fish populations but a low diversity and of submerged and floating aquatic plants.
It is unusual that Carter Pond has a low diversity of submerged aquatic plants, because shallow ponds usually have plants growing from shore to shore. In the case of Carter Pond, plant growth and reproduction might be limited by low levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrient deficiencies may be caused by the pond’s small pond-to-watershed ratio and/or lack of nutrient inflow from an upstream source. In addition, it is possible that the spring that feeds Carter Pond is nutrient-poor, although additional water quality testing will be needed to confirm or disprove this theory.
Carter Pond’s low abundance of aquatic plants may be contributing to another problem the pond is experiencing: low dissolved oxygen. This is because dissolved oxygen often enters the water as a byproduct of aquatic-plant photosynthesis. Thus, low numbers of aquatic plants can limit the amount of dissolved oxygen that enters the water. Lack of aeration due to stagnant water and/or warm water temperatures could also contribute to the low levels of dissolved oxygen in Carter Pond.
Carter Pond is also experiencing high levels of inorganic sediment in the water column. A visual observation of sediment deposition on the north bank suggests that sediment might be eroding into the pond from the north shore after heavy rains. This deposition could be a problem because it limits transparency, decreases benthic habitat diversity, and builds up on the bottom of the pond.
Carter Pond is also dealing with a build-up of organic matter, such as leaves and sticks, on the bottom of the pond. It is currently unclear why this accumulation is greater than decay, but it could be a result of low pond turnover rates, low numbers of decomposer in the benthic environments, or low dissolved oxygen
Threats to Natural Resources.
Erosion poses a major threat to this property along many of the trail. One of the trails most affected is the Fire Road, which is prone to erosion, which causes sediment to be deposited into Carter Pond. These deposits cause the siltation of the pond due which is impacts the aquatic ecosystem and could result in the eventual filling in of the pond. Recent repairs have helped to address erosion but anticipated impacts from climate change will make erosion on ongoing issue. Trail erosion is likely to increase because of recent intense thunder and rain storms, which have increased erosion.
Invasive plants are present but control efforts funded by the Landowner Incentive Program (LIP) over the past few years have helped control these species to the point that routine management should address future control needs. Knapweed is spreading along the power lines. 
Deer also pose a threat to the natural resources at the reservation. When deer numbers are high, browsing pressures can impact forest regeneration and plant species composition. Current browsing pressures at Rock House do not appear to be obvious which could be due to surrounding lands and part of the Reservation which have been open to hunting.
Recreation.
The property is open year round, sunrise to sunset, for hiking, horseback riding, cross country skiing, and hunting (in season). Hunting is only permitted on the part of the property which lies west of the Outer Loop. Fishing is strictly prohibited. Dogs are allowed, but must be kept under voice control or on a leash. Mountain Bikes and Horseback Riders are permitted on the fire road only. The reservation offers more than 3 miles of trails and throughout the property and has moderate hiking which can be strenuous in places.

Jinan Liberation Pavilion

The Jinan Liberation Pavilion () is a monument commemorating the storming of the city of Jinan, Shandong Province by the People's Liberation Army during the Battle of Jinan in the Chinese Civil War. 
The Liberation Pavilion stands in the inner south-eastern corner of the ancient city moat near the site where the troops of People's Liberation Army where able to breach the city wall on September 24, 1948. The city wall has since been removed. 
Construction of the pavilion was completed in September 1986. The entire structure stands about 34 meters tall and occupies an area of 617 square meters. Its overall architectural design follows classical Chinese patterns. Set on broad stone pedestal, the pavilion proper has two stories and is capped by an eaved roof. However, the sides of the pedestal are decorated with bas-relief stone carvings that depict scenes from the civil-war battle for Jinan in the style of Socialist realism. Another notable decorative feature of the pavilion are the gilded relief inscriptions that read "Liberation Pavilion" on the stone pedestal as well as on the pavilion proper. The characters of these inscriptions were taken from the handwriting of Marshal Chen Yi, who commanded the Shandong counter-offensive during the Chinese Civil War. The interior of the pavilion houses an exhibition related to the civil war battle for Jinan.

East African Children's Education Fund

The East African Children’s Education Fund, known as EACEF, is a not-for-profit organization founded by a group of high school students in October 2007. EACEF is student-staffed and operates as a fully independent 501(c)3 public charity. EACEF seeks to improve educational environments in East Africa by constructing school buildings and implementing learning programs. Having raised in excess of $250,000 dollars, EACEF is the largest independent student-run nonprofit organization in the United States.
Mission statement.
EACEF exists to create and promote educational opportunity for academically gifted, economically disadvantaged children in East Africa.
About.
Originally focused in Central Province, Kenya, EACEF has now expanded into Western Uganda. In both countries, EACEF engages in programs ranging from the promotion of English-language literacy to the development of inter-community relations. EACEF strives to create environments conducive to learning in every aspect of its outreach: through implementing the Nafasi Process, infrastructure initiatives such as the construction of fully equipped classrooms, libraries, kitchens, and latrines help to accommodate the everyday necessities of the students. Programs tailored to the needs of the students and teachers alike were also designed to ensure the efficient use of the new buildings. EACEF instills academic encouragement in communities that face educational hardships and believes that the first step to prosperity is proper schooling.
The Kirimara Project represents the first trial run of the Nafasi Process. Astounding improvements were achieved in both the lives of the students and their performance in the classroom through the unique combination of infrastructure improvements and enhancement programs.
The Chania Project seeks to replicate the successes achieved at Kilimara under the Nafasi Process. Located in Nyeri, Kenya, the school serves the children of destitute migrant laborers and squatters.
The Shalom Project is EACEF’s first venture into Uganda. The school will serve a population long neglected in the wartorn region of Western Uganda.
Founding story.
EACEF grew out of a realization on the part of its founder, Andrew Sugrue. In March 2007, he traveled to Kenya on an endowed exchange program through The Westminster Schools of Atlanta. Traveling throughout the country, Sugrue visited schools where libraries consisted of a single shelf with four or five books under a leaky roof. In contrast, the children who called these makeshift quarters their schools often exhibited academic potential and, given the chance, could greatly benefit from a decent education. Sadly, the Kenyan education system allows only the top fifth of school-age children to advance to high school; only those who receive the highest marks on the English-language KCPE exam are admitted. Many children living in rural communities unfortunately do not have the materials necessary to learn English, leaving them incapable of passing an exam in a foreign language.
Inspired, Sugrue returned home with the dream of addressing these inadequacies. With the help of visionaries like Scott Hawkins of the Mount Kenya Academy (MKA) Foundation, Kemi Nix of Children's Literature for Children, and Charity Mwangi, the Founder and Director of MKA, EACEF took form. Based on its mission of promoting opportunity through education, EACEF seeks to ensure that every student has the chance to live up to their potential. By providing educational support from furnished classrooms to school meals, rural children in East Africa will have the opportunity to go on to high school and to college. EACEF continues to grow with its first project at Kilimara Primary School outside of Nyeri, Kenya, now completed. EACEF intends to extend this successful design through itsnewly developed program, the Nafasi Process.

Knudsen flow

Knudsen flow describes the movement of fluids with a high Knudsen number, that is, where the characteristic dimension of the flow space is of the same or smaller order of magnitude as the mean free path. 
Separation processes using Knudsen Flow.
For a gas passing through small holes in a thin wall in the Knudsen Flow regime, the number of molecules that pass through a hole is proportional to the pressure of the gas and inversely proportional to its molecular weight. It is therefore possible to effect a partial separation of a mixture of gases if the components have different molecular weights. The technique is used to separate isotopic mixtures such as uranium using porous membranes. It has also been successfully demonstrated for use in hydrogen production, as a technique for separating hydrogen from the gaseous product mixture created when water is heated at high temperatures using solar or other energy sources.

Anbu Thozhi () is a 2007 film based on a love triangle between an aspiring musician, an immigrant from Sri Lanka and a Tamil Militant leader. The movie is directed by L. G. Ravichandran and music was scored by J.K Selva.
Plot.
The film opens with a simpleton from a small village in Tamil Nadu wanting to become a musician in the Tamil film industry. The role played by debutant "Prabhu" (Prabhu) goes to Chennai in search of his dream career where he meets Pandya (Mayil Samy). Pandya helps Prabhu into the big city life and they become good friends. Prabhu meets Yazhini (Preethi Verma) who helps him meet a famous Director, who gives Prabhu a chance to prove his music skills. 
On becoming a successful man, Prabhu finds love in Yazhini who helped him achieve his dream. When Prabhu decides to reveal his feelings for Yazhini, she breaks the news about Karuppu (Thirumavalavan) who helped her many years ago when she was abandoned as a child during the war and also helped her reach India. Yazhini requests Prabhu to go find and talk to Karuppu about her love for Karuppu. Prabhu hides his love and sets off to find Karuppu. On meeting Karuppu, Prabhu realizes that he is a man for the country which he is fighting for and that he has no room in his heart for any individual human soul. His country was his life.
Prabhu returns home a confused man and tells Yazhini that Karuppu also was in love with her and that he will soon come to marry her. Confusions grow as Prabhu's mother comes to Chennai to meet her future daughter in law. Pandya reveals the truth about Karuppu to everybody and Yazhini realizes that by waiting for Karuppu (who will never come) she is not giving life its true meaning.
The film closes with Yazhini and Prabhu getting together.

The Norrœna Society was the imprint of a private publishing venture that between 1905 and 1911 produced multi-volume sets of reprints of classic 19th-century editions, mostly translations, of Old Norse literary and historical works, Northern European folklore, and medieval literature.
Historical Background.
The Norrœnna Society was founded around 1896 as "a federation of Anglo-Nordic men of letters", by King Oscar II of Norway and Sweden for the purpose of “resurrecting, reproducing, collecting and collating or indexing every thing that pertained to the early history of the Anglo Saxon, Celtic, Teutonic, and Scandinavian races— to furnish the people of Northern Europe with their own vital history.” Under his ægis, the Society grew rapidly, becoming international in scope, represented in London, Stockholm, Copenhagen, New York and Berlin. In Great Britain, where the name of the Society was changed to the Anglo-Saxon Society, membership reached 30,000. Upon expanding into America, the name was again changed to The International Anglo-Saxon Society. At that stage, the Society began issuing elaborate, official certificates of membership. According to surviving examples, known members included Dr. Johnathan Ackerman Coles of Newark, New Jersey and E.F. Wehrle of Los Angeles, California. 
The Norrœna Society was led by Rasmus B. Anderson, who served as United States Ambassador to Denmark (1885-9) and the founding head of the Department of Scandinavian Studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, the oldest such department in an American university. He spearheaded the "large literary venture" as part of his lifelong aim to educate others, particularly Americans, about the culture, history and pre-Christian religion of Northern Europe, publishing a wide range of works on these subjects. 
In Old Norse, "Norrœna" means "Norse" or "Norwegian." Anderson himself used the term to apply to medieval Northern European literature, which he also referred to as Anglo-Saxon classics, according to faceplates in all volumes of the Norrœna Library. In academic references to these publications, the word Norrœna is commonly transliterated as Norroena and less often as Norraena. 
From 1905 to 1907, Rasmus Anderson acted as editor-in-chief of the Norrœna Library, a multi-volume subscription set, which he considered “the crowning part of my efforts in the service of Scandinavian literature.” The purpose of this effort was to make reprints of important works in the field widely available to the English-speaking world, particularly the American public. Eight of the volumes were his own translations. The remainder were by other translators with their consent. Various bibliographic references to these sets list as few as eight volumes and as many as sixteen. The most common number of volumes listed is fifteen. James William Buel (1849–1920), a prolific American author, compiler, and editor of numerous books in a wide range of subjects, acted as managing editor. T.H. Smart held the copyright. Despite the fact that the Norroena Society has been recognized as a federation of learned men, Andrew Wawn questions the existence of an actual society. The majority of the editions contain a frontispiece stating that the volumes were “privately printed for members,” and a "certificate of membership" was bound into the first volume at least one known set. The most common criticism of these editions is the fact that they were considered inexpensive reprints of earlier works. Still many collectors held these sets, many finely bound, in high regard. In a letter to Anderson, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt stated that he kept his set in the most valued part of his library.
At the time of their publication, the Norrœna Library was the largest collection of medieval Nordic literature published outside of Scandinavia. Bound in ten different historical bindings, each set originally sold for USD $50 to $2,500 per set, priced according to print, paper quality, illustrations, and binding. Each edition had a limited print run. These sets were usually hand-numbered and all contained hand-colored illustrations. The Stanford University Library and the Library of Congress hold unnumbered sets. Individual works do not contain markings indicating volume number, and volume numbers sometimes vary between sets, according to catalogued library holdings. Known editions of the set include:
Each of these contain an elaborately illustrated color frontispiece stating, "Anglo-Saxon Classics. Norrœna Embracing the History and Romance of Northern Europe” with the words “privately printed for members” at the base of the illustration. The remainder of the sets contain a simple frontispiece consisting of a decorated border framing the descriptive phrase, "The History and Romance of Northern Europe; a Library of Supreme Classics Printed in Complete Form.” These editions include:
Other known editions include:
This list is not inclusive. Other editions may exist. Public and private libraries across the United States and Europe purchased many of these sets. The remainder are held by private collectors and booksellers.
Complete Works.
Volume numbers are based on the Imperial Edition (1906). According to bibliographic references, volume numbering may have varied by edition. Since volumes do not contain internal markings indication their order, these variations may be due to individual library cataloging procedures. 
Books 11-15 are known collectively (and erroneously) as "The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles":
In addition, a sixteenth volume was published by the Norreona Society in 1906 without either frontispiece which characterizes the Norroena Library editions, accounting for bibliographic references to a sixteen volume set:

Ajapa japa

Japa (or japam) means repeating or remembering a mantra (or mantram), and ajapa-japa (or ajapajapam) means constant awareness of the mantra, or of what it represents. The letter A in front of the word japa means without. Thus, ajapa-japa is the practice of japa without the mental effort normally needed to repeat the mantra. In other words, it has begun to come naturally, turning into a constant awareness. The practice of constant remembrance evolves in stages: 
At first, you intentionally repeat the syllables of the mantra internally, as if you are talking to yourself in your mind. You allow the inner sound to come at whatever speed feels comfortable to the mind. Sometimes it is very slow, as if the mind were wading through a vat of honey. At other times it is very fast, as if flying through the sky without restraint. 
With practice, the mantra japa is repeated automatically, like a song that you have heard many times, which just comes on its own. (Some practitioners consider this automatic repeating to be the meaning of Ajapa-Japa, though there is a subtler meaning, as described below.) 
Gradually, you merely remember the mantra with attention drawn to it. It is more like noticing what is already happening, rather than causing it to happen. It is somewhat like the attention stance of listening rather than speaking, though you might not literally hear the sound. 
In time, the feeling of the mantra is there, even when the sound or remembering of the syllables is not there. For example, sometimes people will say, "Om, Shanti, Shanti, Shanti," where the word Shanti means peace or tranquility. During the remembering of the word there may be two things—the word and the feeling of peace or tranquility. When the syllables fade away, the feeling may still be there; this is remembrance of the feeling of the mantra. 
As the practice evolves, there comes a pervasive awareness of the mantra, subtler than both the syllables and any surface level meaning or definition. This constant awareness is the meaning of Ajapa-Japa of the mantra.
While the word 'japa' is Sanskrit, and the practice described here associated with Hinduism, the same basic practice and result is also found in other faith traditions. Examples include the Jesus Prayer practice of Orthodox Christianity,
Zikr or Dhikr (with alternate spellings depending on transliteration method) in Islamic contexts, particularly Sufi (6, 7), and several traditions within Catholic Christianity (8, 9).

Susan Gaertner

Susan Gaertner is a Minnesota politician and the former County Attorney for Ramsey County, Minnesota. She was a candidate for the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party endorsement for Governor in the 2010 election.
Family and early life.
Gaertner grew up on the Eastside of St. Paul during a period of opportunity for working-class families. Her mother and father took full advantage of this environment, with her mother attending college at a time it was uncommon for women to pursue higher education, and her father served as a social worker in Ramsey County. Gaertner currently lives in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, with her husband, John Wodele, the former press secretary for Governor Jesse Ventura. She has three daughters.
Education and professional career.
Gaertner attended Harding High School in Saint Paul, Minnesota. She went on to graduate from the University of Minnesota Duluth and the University of Minnesota Law School. After graduation, Gaertner served as a clerk in the office of Federal Appeals Court Judge Gerald W. Heaney, and later worked as a criminal defense attorney for the William Mauzy Law Firm. Gaertner then joined the Ramsey County's attorney office in 1984.
In 1989, while working for the Ramsey County Attorney's office, she became the first Minnesota prosecutor to introduce DNA evidence in court. Later, as Ramsey County Attorney, Gaertner established programs designed to curb domestic violence.
Awards and honors.
In 2002 Gaertner was inducted into the Harding High School Hall of Fame in recognition of her successful Truancy Intervention Program. In 2004, the Minnesota County Attorneys Association awarded her the group's highest honor—an honor presented annually to a county attorney who exhibits extraordinary leadership in the field of justice. An accomplished trial attorney who has continued trying cases after being elected county attorney, Gaertner was inducted in the elite American College of Trial Lawyers in 2009.
2010 Gubernatorial Run.
In 2009, Gaertner announced her candidacy for governor as a Democrat, citing her experience as a prosecutor in Ramsey County. Gaertner initially indicated she would not seek party endorsement, but would instead run in the DFL primary in August 2010. On April 26, 2010, Gaertner announced that she would withdraw from the race.
Khou Phong Lee trial and aftermath.
In the summer of 2010, prisoner Khoua Phong Lee was released from prison after a retrial was ordered in manslaughter convictions in the crash involving his Toyota vehicle which killed three people. Susan Gaertner, who had consistently opposed his release (even after over 100 people had died in crashes related defective Toyotas), offered to release Lee from prison on the condition that he admit to guilt and register as a convicted felon, this during final deliberations of the appeals court deciding on his right to retrial. Immediately upon the court overturning his conviction and ordering a retrial, Gaertner announced she would not be pursuing another case against him; raising questions in the legal community and in the press about her judicial judgement for inexplicably flipping positions ex post facto. 
Two months later, Gaertner announced she would not be seeking re-election. She never explained why she didn't hold Toyota responsible for a crime that killed three people, but reporters in local newspapers report that her office called and harassed the paper when they were covering the story.

Uriburu

The surname Uriburu is of Basque origin and means "head of town" in the Basque language.
The origin of the first people using this surname is in the 9th century. Some warriors fought in the battle of Beotivar using that name. It seems the Uriburu were originally "de Uruburu" and the name changed in 1786 when the first Uriburu arrived to the north of Argentina, then the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata. The de Uruburu family originally had their properties near Mendata,a small town in Guipuzcoa,in the Basque Provinces of the north of Spain. Today still remains the small town with the name of Uruburu. The Uriburu family stayed in Argentina until today, giving famous military, governors and Presidents to the country of Argentina. They were linked by family to other named families as de Alvear, Quintana, and Anchorena. The original shield of arms of this family had the figure of a silver tower on a gold mountain in a red background surrounded by blue stars.
In the United States the family stills keeps the original name, "de Uruburu." In Argentina, the Uriburus were involved in the British invasions of the Río de la Plata, fighting against the invaders; in General Martín Miguel de Güemes's campaign in Salta Province against the Spanish Army]; in General Belgrano's campaigns; and in General José de San Martín's campaign for giving freedom to Chile and Peru. Decades later, they would took part in Julio Roca's "Conquest of the Desert". A member of Roca's National Autonomist Party, José Evaristo Uriburu was Vice-President to Luis Sáenz Peña. When the latter resigned in 1895, Uriburu became President. On 6 September 1930, the first modern coup d'état in modern Argentina was headed by José Félix Uriburu, José Evaristo's nephew. Previously Jose Felix Uriburu had been elected Senator for Salta Province, in a democratic election. Two years after the coup he retired instead of remaining as de facto President, allowing a new democratic government to manage Argentina and discarting the possibility of a civil war .

Georg Loeschcke

Georg Loeschcke (June 28, 1852 - November 26, 1915) was a German archaeologist born in Penig, Saxony.
He studied archaeology under Johannes Overbeck in Leipzig, afterwards continuing his education at the University of Bonn, where he was a student of Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz. In 1877-78 he participated in a study trip to Greece and Italy under the aegis of the "Deutsches Archäologisches Institut". As a result of this research he published with Adolf Furtwängler, "Mykenische Thongefäße", a landmark work that provided important historical timelines for Mycenaean pottery. In their investigations of Mycanaean pottery, Loeschcke and Furtwängler gave distinctions between it and Geometric pottery. 
In 1879 Loeschcke became a professor of philology and archaeology at the University of Dorpat, where he co-authored another important work on Mycenaean pottery with Furtwängler titled "Mykenische Vasen" (1886). In 1887 he was appointed first secretary to the "Deutsches Archäologisches Institut" in Athens, and two years later succeeded Kekulé as professor at the University of Bonn. At Bonn, he was dean to the faculty (1895–96), university rector (1909–10) and director of the university museum (1889–1912). In 1912 he again succeeded Kekulé, in this instance as professor of classical archaeology at the University of Berlin. In 1913 Loeschcke was appointed a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. 
Loeschcke performed archaeological investigations of "Limes Germanicus", which were a series of frontier forts that bounded the ancient Roman provinces of Rhaetia and Germania Superior. He also performed investigations at the Kaiserthermen (Imperial Baths in Trier) and at the Roman camp in Haltern.

Birket Israel

Birket Israel (trans. "Pool of Israel") also Birket Israil or Birket Isra'in, abbreviated from Birket Asbât Beni Israìl (trans. "Pool of the Tribes of the Children of Israel") was a public cistern located on the north-eastern corner of the Temple Mount, in Jerusalem. The structure is believed to have been built by the Romans for use as a water reservoir and also to protect the northern wall of the Temple Mount. Arab natives have known it by this name since at least 1857.
By the mid-19th century it had gone out of use as a reservoir; being partly filled with rubbish and reused as a vegetable garden. In 1934 it was filled in and is now known as el-Ghazali Square. It is currently in mixed use for shops, as a car park, and as a transshipment point for refuse.
Construction.
According to Muslim tradition, the reservoir was constructed by Ezekiel or Hezekiah, King of Judah. Some archaeologists have determined that the cistern was possibly built during the Herodian period to improve Jerusalem's water supply. Others estimate the date of construction later, in around 130 CE. This view is held by Charles Warren who recorded that although some kind of fosse must have existed at the spot at a very early period, since there is no description of the pool in the works of Josephus, "and it is very improbable that he world have omitted to mention so enormous a reservoir had it existed in his time", it was most probably constructed by Roman emperor Hadrian during his restoration of Jerusalem. This is further attested to since the masonry of the birket is inferior in character and resembles the later Roman work in Syria. Additionally, this reservoir appears to be mentioned by the Bordeaux Pilgrim (section 4) as already existing, and "would therefore most naturally be referable to Hadrian."
It was constructed in the bed of the western fork of the Kidron Valley that traverses the north-west quarter of the city. It formed Jerusalem's largest reservoir, measuring by with a maximum depth of . The cistern contained a total capacity of 120,000 cubic meters and for centuries it formed part of Jerusalem's rainwater storage system. The pool also served as a moat, protecting the northern wall of the Temple Mount.
The eastern and western ends of the pool were partially rock-cut and partly masonry. The masonry at the eastern end formed a great dam thick, the lower part of which was continuous with an ancient eastern wall of the Temple compound. The sides of the pool were lined entirely with masonry because it was built across the width of a valley. The original bottom of the reservoir was covered with a layer of about 19 inches of very hard Roman concrete and cement. There was a great conduit at the eastern end of the pool built of massive stones, and connected with the pool by a perforated stone with three round holes 5½ inches in diameter. The position of this outlet shows that all water over a depth of must have flowed away.
Association with the Pool of Bethesda.
The Birket Israel cistern was frequented by Christian pilgrims during the 19th century, it being previously identified as the "Sheep Pool" or Pool of Bethesda of John 5:2; a double-pool with five porches, where the sick came to be cured. This link was based on the premise that the nearby St. Stephen's Gate occupied the site of the Sheep Gate mentioned in the New Testament. It was reinforced by the co-location of the names 'Birket Israel' and the 'Pool of Bethesda' on maps and plans of Jerusalem; and in drawings and paintings, such as those made by David Roberts in 1893.
According to Kopp, the Pool of Bethesda became associated with a Byzantine church by 450 CE; then a 6th-century church, which by the arrival of the Crusaders, in 1099, was known as the "Church of St. Anne". A new Church of St. Anne was built in the 12th century CE; the church and the pool fell into disuse after the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The church was converted into madrasah and Christian pilgrims were redirected to nearby Birket Israel on the other side of what is now called the "Via Dolorosa". Ownership of the whole site of the Church of St. Anne passed to France after the Crimean War, in 1856; and discoveries made in around 1870 led to the belief that the real Pool of Bethesda was actually located in the grounds of the Church of St. Anne.
Later uses.
By the mid-19th century, Birket Israel was no longer being used as a reservoir; and towards the end of the 19th century it was being rapidly filled with refuse and part of it was being used as a vegetable garden. In 1934 the pool was filled in because its condition posed a threat to public health. 
Being located just inside the Lions' Gate, one of the major entries to the Old City, the East Jerusalem Development Company initially intended to excavate the reservoir and build a multi-storey car park at the site. This post-1967 plan was rejected by the "waqf" authorities who own the plot because they feared that clearance work at the base of the Temple Mount would endanger the Haram compound. Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.
Today the area is known as el-Ghazali Square and is used as a car park and collection point for refuse before it is dumped outside the city. Some small shops also exist at the site.

It is played by slapping the top face with a piece of wood in one hand, and a bare hand. It was developed as a substitute of the tarima de baile of Oaxaca and Guerrero. It usually follows 3/4 and 6/8 time signatures. In 1962, musicologist E. Thomas Stanford made a description of its use in Jamiltepec, Oaxaca.

Aboriginal tracker

In the years following British settlement in Australia, aboriginal trackers or black trackers, as they became known, were enlisted by settlers to assist them in navigating their way through the Australian landscape. The trackers' hunter-gatherer lifestyle gave rise to excellent tracking skills which were advantageous to settlers in assisting them in finding food and water and locating missing persons or capturing bushrangers.
The first recorded employment of the services of Aboriginal trackers in Australia was in 1834, near Fremantle, Western Australia, when two trackers named Mogo and Mollydobbin tracked a missing five-year-old boy for over ten hours through the rough Australian bush. Another notable early event occurred in 1864 when Duff children Jane (7), Isaac (9) and Frank (4) Duff, lost for nine days in Wimmera, were found by aboriginal tracker 'King Richard'.
Tracking.
When asked how he tracked, Mitamirri, a famous tracker of the early 20th century, said "I never bend down low, just walk slow round and round until I see more."
In 1845 Edward Stone Parker the Assistant Protector of Aborigines based at the Loddon Aboriginal Protectorate Station at Franklinford, wrote a letter to the Chief Protector reporting on the murder of a native at Joyce's Station (near Newstead). No witness could be found to the murder but the footprints of five men were tracked by the Jajowurrong to open country south of Mount Macedon (Sunbury region). The trackers there met with another man attached to the Loddon Protectorate Station who was on his return from Melbourne. He told the trackers he had met with the group they were tracking and was able to give a description of them.
Two members of the Queensland Native Mounted Police Force, Wannamutta and Werannabe, assisted in the capture of Ned Kelly at Glenrowan, Victoria in 1880. They had been promised ₤50 reward for Kelly's capture but descendants claimed the two were never paid.
Native Police.
The Port Phillip Native Police Corps was established in Victoria in 1842 and employed aboriginal trackers to carry out duties which included searching for missing persons, carrying messages, and escorting dignitaries through unfamiliar territory. During the goldrush era, they were also used to patrol goldfields and search for escaped prisoners. They were provided with uniforms, firearms, food rations and a rather dubious salary.
In 1879 the services of a group of Queensland black police were requested to help track the Kelly gang which were on the run from the Victorian police. Their use was agreed and a party of six native troopers, with a white officer (Sub-Inspector Stanhope O'Conner) reached Benalla about March 1879.
A similar force was established in New South Wales in 1848 by Governor Charles Fitzroy and in 1859, Queensland, now a separate colony, took control of the force until 1900.
Recent and present day use.
In 1941, the Northern Territory Special Reconnaissance Unit was established to patrol the North Australian coastline for Japanese landings and infiltration, and was primarily composed of Aboriginal soldiers. The 2/1st North Australia Observer Unit ("Nackaroos") performed a similar role, though Aboriginals were a minority in the unit, serving as labourers and trackers.
In the present day Australian Army, the Regional Force Surveillance Units can be seen as a spiritual descendant of the Tracker legacy.
Aboriginal trackers within the Queensland police force wore yellow epaulets to denote their role. By 2012, only one tracker remained, Lama Lama elder Barry Port. Queensland police do not expect another tracker to replace Port.

Jim Foster (activist)

James M. "Jim" Foster (November 19, 1934 – October 31, 1990) was an American LGBT rights and Democratic activist. Foster became active in the early gay rights movement when he moved to San Francisco following his undesirable discharge from the United States Army in 1959 for being homosexual. Foster co-founded the Society for Individual Rights (SIR), an early homophile organization, in 1964. Dianne Feinstein credits SIR and the gay vote with generating her margin of victory in her election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969. 
In 1971, Foster, along with Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, transformed SIR into the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club. The Toklas club was the first gay Democratic club in San Francisco. Also in 1971, Foster was instrumental in convincing Richard Hongisto to run for sheriff and in delivering gay votes to his winning campaign. It became a truism of San Francisco politics that, as long-time activist José Sarria had put it, "nobody ran for anything in San Francisco without knocking on the door of the gay community."
In 1972, after the Toklas club delivered one-third of the signatures needed to secure George McGovern the first position on the California Democratic primary ballot, Foster was given a prime time television spot speaking at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. He and fellow delegate Madeline Davis were the first openly LGBT people ever to address a national party convention. He called upon the Democratic Party to add a gay rights plank to the party platform, saying:"We do not come to you begging your understanding or pleading your tolerance. We come to you affirming our pride in our lifestyle, affirming the validity of our right to seek and to maintain meaningful emotional relationships and affirming our right to participate in the life of this country on an equal basis with every citizen." Foster and other gay rights activists got a minority report to the floor but the plank was defeated.
Foster was approached by fledgling gay politician Harvey Milk in 1973. Milk sought Foster's endorsement for his first campaign for Supervisor. Foster, who through the Toklas club had staked out a position that it was best for the gay community to work with liberal establishment politicians than try to elect gay candidates, refused to support Milk's campaign. This led to an enmity between the men which lasted until Milk's assassination in 1978. It has been suggested that this enmity, which extended to the Toklas club and the Milk-founded San Francisco Gay Democratic Club, may have hampered the LGBT community's early efforts to address the spread of HIV in San Francisco. 
In 1980, Foster served as the coordinator for northern California for Ted Kennedy's presidential campaign. When Kennedy's campaign was struggling financially, Foster kept his local campaign office open using his own funds. Kennedy credited Foster for delivering his victory in the 1980 California primary.
Foster was a founding member of the San Francisco Health Commission in 1985. In 1989 he was hired by pharmaceutical company Lymphomed as a consultant.
Foster died of an AIDS-related illness at his San Francisco home on October 31, 1990.

The Chalk Hills are a north—south running low 'mountain' range in the San Fernando Valley perpendicular to and adjoining the Santa Monica Mountains. They are located in the Woodland Hills District of the City of Los Angeles in Southern California. They run between DeSoto and Winnetka Avenues, from south of Ventura Boulevard to near Victory Boulevard.
Environs.
Los Angeles Pierce College is located on the northern portion of the Chalk Hills. Historically the free-flowing Los Angeles River ran around that portion. U.S. Route 101, the Ventura Freeway, cuts deeply through the southern part since the 1960s.
The range has a white chalky soil and bedrock, and was a 'white landform' Valley landmark before suburban development on it in the 1960s. A small remnant California oak woodland plant community remains in an undeveloped southeastern area of the Pierce campus.
