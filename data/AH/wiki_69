Dayne had 200 yards on 34 carries and was named the Rose Bowl's Most Valuable Player for the second consecutive year. He became one of only three (now, four) players to win two Rose Bowl MVPs (Washington's Bob Schloredt, Southern California's Charles White, and Texas' Vince Young are the others).
Dayne won the Heisman Trophy, the second player in Wisconsin's history to receive this award, after Alan Ameche in 1954. He also received many other awards in this season and throughout his college career, including Big Ten Conference Player of the Year, and All-American placement. Dayne's career rushing total remains an NCAA record. Bowl games included, he amassed 7,125 yards, becoming the first player in NCAA history to total over 7,000 rushing yards.

Cameron Clark (project manager)

Cameron Clark is the project manager responsible for the design and construction of the first and only multi-hulled hybrid ferry in the United States, the Hornblower Hybrid.
Background.
Clark led the team that was the first group of engineers to successfully design and build a hybrid drive system for the Hornblower Hybrid in the United States. Clark managed the project from beginning to end, determining which vessel would be retrofitted, what equipment to use to create the most environmentally friendly vessel, and managed the crew that worked on the project. Clark is now in the process of completing two more hybrid vessels, one for service to Alcatraz Island and the other to serve visitors to the Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island. For these vessels, he is researching using hydrogen to power the vessel, making it emissions free.
The San Francisco Hornblower Hybrid is a technological achievement that no other company in the United States has been able to accomplish. Similar to a Toyota Prius, this vessel uses sun and wind energy to charge batteries that power the electric motors. When additional power is needed, a Tier 2 diesel generator can be used. Even when the generator is in use, this vessel only uses between 5-7 gallons of fuel per hour while more typical ferry boats uses five to six times that amount.
Biography.
Clark is the Director of Environmental Affairs for Alcatraz Cruises. In this role he led the company to its successful certification for ISO 9001, ISO 14000 and OHSAS 18001. With this, Alcatraz Cruises became the first service company in the United States to meet all three international standards for environmental management, quality and health and safety. For this Alcatraz Cruises was awarded Green Business of the Year by the San Francisco Business Times in 2008.
He is a graduate of the California Maritime Academy, where he cruised on the famed Golden Bear through Central and South America, as well as the South Pacific. He has a Masters in Business Administration from Carnegie Mellon University. He is a sought after speaker in the maritime industry, having presented at the Ferries 2009 Conference in Seattle, WA; the Greenships 2009 Conference in Washington, DC; the Passenger Vessel Association Forum in San Francisco, CA. 09.pdf

Joseph A. Walker (playwright)

Joseph Alexander Walker (24.02.1935–2003) was an American playwright and screenwriter, theater director, actor and professor. He is best known for writing "The River Niger", a three-act play that was originally produced Off-Broadway in 1972 by the Negro Ensemble Company, before being transferred to Broadway in 1973 and then adapted into a 1976 film of the same name starring James Earl Jones and Cicely Tyson. In 1974, Walker became the first African-American writer to win the Tony Award, being honored for "The River Niger". The playwright previously won an Obie Award during that play's 1972-73 Off-Broadway run.
Biography.
Walker was born in Washington, D.C, to Joseph A. Walker and Florine G. Johnson. He earned an undergraduate degree in Philosophy from Howard University and completed all requirements except the thesis for a Masters in Philosophy. In 1957, he entered the Air Force as a Second Lieutenant and later received a Master of Fine Arts degree in Drama from Catholic University. In his later years, he taught Drama at Howard University and served as chairman of the Theater Department at Rutgers University.
Walker was one of the first African Americans, along with Lorraine Hansberry, to win the Tony Award for best promising play, which he won for "The River Niger". His efforts and talents drew him critical acclaim at the Negro Ensemble Company (NEC) with Douglas Turner Ward as the artistic director. "The River Niger's" run was one of the NEC's longest consecutive runs. Other works include the drama "District Line", "Yin-Yang", "The Harangues" (Tribal Harangue 1, 2,and 3), "The Lion is a Soul Brother", "Out of the Ashes", "Absolution of Willie Mae", "Koulaba D. Haiti", and the musical "King Buddy Bolden".
Early life.
Walker met his first wife, Barbara Ann, in philosophy class; they were married in September 1957. That same year Walker entered the Air Force, going first to San Antonio, Texas, and then to Harlingen Air Force Base before serving as First Lieutenant, 2nd in command of 350 Airmen of the 42nd Supply Squadron. In 1958–60, while stationed at Loring Air Force Base, Walker became founder and artistic director of Pine Tree Theatre Guild. During that time, his first son, Michael Alexander Walker, was born. Walker's second son, Steven Martin Walker, was born in 1962; that same year, Walker was discharged and decided to pursue an MFA in Theatre with a minor in Elizabethan Drama at Catholic University. During this time, Barbara Walker pursued her law degree.
Walker's time in the Air Force is significant because the main character from "The River Niger", Jeff Williams, was also discharged from the Air Force. The Williams character also makes references to symbolically asking everyone at the Air Force base to let go of my toe. Barbara Walker has stated that "The River Niger" may be semi-autobiographical.
He taught at Spingarn High School in Washington D.C. from 1963 to 1965 as an English/Drama teacher.
Artistic career.
He then began the pursuit of an acting career In 1966. He began studying voice and vocal reproduction from Brook Alexander, and at the end of that year joined Voices, Inc. He remained narrator, lead singer and artistic director of this organization until "The Believers" was produced in 1968. The Believers was co-authored by Walker and Josephine Jackson.
In 1969 to 1975, he taught at CCNY Leonard Davis Center of Performing Arts. as an Associate Professor in the Speech and Theatre Department. Also in 1969 he met Moses Gun who introduced him to Douglas Turner Ward, the Artistic director of The Negro Ensemble Company (NEC), which led to the production of "The Harangues", opening the 1969-70 season. "Ododo", which Walker wrote, directed and co-choreographed opened with mixed reviews in the 1970-71 season at NEC, whose music was composed and directed by his second wife Dorothy Ann Dinroe-Walker, also a Howard University graduate. Walker married Dorothy A. Dinroe in 1970, a match made in their love for the arts.
Wanting to create his own theatre company, Walker became the artistic director of the Demi-Gods. The Demi-Gods was co-founded with his wife Dinroe-Walker, between 1970 and 1974. In 1971-72, Walker along with Dorothy A. Walker co-produced "Yin-Yang" at the African American Studio. In 1972-73, Douglas Turner Ward went into production for the "The River Niger". The response to "The River Niger" was so overwhelming that the play was moved to the Brooks Atkinson Theatre on Broadway in 1973, where it won the Tony Award in 1974. In this same year his first daughter, Kumina Walker, was born.
Walker received 400 hours towards a Motion Picture Production Certificate received at the Germaine School of Photography, New York City, in 1973. He also completed 28 credits towards his Ph.D. program in Cinema Studies at New York University, and was honored as Playwright-in-Residence at Yale School of Drama.
Later life.
Walker spent his last years continuing his writings while maintaining full tenure as well as Theatre Arts Chair for Rutgers University's Camden Campus. He is survived by his five children Michael Walker, Steven Walker, Kumina Walker, Nandi Walker and Jodoa Walker. Walker's youngest son, Kamau Walker, predeceased him in 2001.

1998 Wisconsin Badgers football team

The 1998 Wisconsin Badgers football team represented the University of Wisconsin during the 1998 NCAA Division I-A football season.
Season.
Wisconsin finished the regular season 10–1 overall (7–1 conference) and were co-champions of the Big Ten Conference (with Ohio State and Michigan) for the first time since 1993. They were awarded the berth in the 1999 Rose Bowl due to Big Ten Conference tie-breaking rules, at the time, which gave the Rose Bowl invitation to the tied team which had gone the longest period of time without an invitation: Michigan had been in the 1998 Rose Bowl, Ohio State had been in the 1997 Rose Bowl, while Wisconsin's last Rose Bowl was 1994.
The circumstances of this selection, the fact that Ohio State was the higher-ranked team (Ohio State was the pre-season #1 and spent most of the season with this ranking: Wisconsin did not play Ohio State or Michigan State that year, so Ohio State had the better record versus common opponents due to the Michigan loss), combined with the fact that the opponent (UCLA) was ranked #2 and headed to the national title game before a season-ending loss, led to ridicule in the national media: most notably, Craig James' declaration that Wisconsin was "the worst team to ever play in the Rose Bowl." Wisconsin went on to defeat #6 UCLA 38–31 in the 1999 Rose Bowl. Afterward, Badger coach Barry Alvarez fired back, "Well, I know we're at least the second worst."

Burton Closes

Burton Closes is a 19th-century country house, now in use as a residential nursing home, situated at Haddon Road, Bakewell, Derbyshire. It is a Grade II* listed building.
The house was newly built in 1848 for John Allcard, a wealthy Quaker banker and stockbroker of Derby. It was originally built as a modest two bedroomed house, to a design by architect Joseph Paxton with interiors by Augustus Pugin and intended as a summer retreat. It was much extended by T D Barry and E W Pugin in 1856 for Allcard's son William, a railway engineer, best known for his 1830 work on the Sankey Viaduct, Warrington, Cheshire, where he was mayor in 1848 and 1851.
The Allcard family fortunes were much reduced by a financial downturn in 1866 and in 1871 William Henry Allcard, a barrister, sold the estate.
Further improvements and extensions were made in 1888 by J B Mitchell Withers for the purchaser Smith Taylor-Whithead, who was High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1894.

Cairns began his football career with Ardwick towards the end of their last season before joining the Football League, in March 1892. However, it was more than 18 months before he made his debut for Ardwick, playing at right half in a 3–2 home defeat to Newcastle United on 21 October 1893. That match turned out to be Cairns' only appearance for the club, and he joined Newton Heath in September 1894. Again, Cairns had a substantial wait before his debut for the Heathens, finally playing at left full back in a 2–1 defeat away to Bury on 15 April 1895. This was to be his only appearance for Newton Heath, and he left football at the end of the season.

Edeirnion

Edeirnion or Edeyrnion is an area of the county of Denbighshire and an ancient commote of medieval Wales. According to tradition, it was named after its eponymous founder Edern or Edeyrn. It was included as a Welsh territory of Shropshire in the Domesday Book.
Edeirnion was nominally a part of the Kingdom of Powys but was often subject to border intrusions by the neighbouring Kingdom of Gwynedd. These rumbling border disputes caused a great deal of friction between the two realms. Edeirnion was occupied and annexed by Gwynedd in the reign of Llywelyn the Great but briefly returned to Powys following a treaty forced on Gwynedd by England after Llywelyn's death in 1240. The territory was again occupied by Gwynedd after 1267 before being returned again to Powys. This continuing dispute and the appeal by Llywelyn the Last to Edward I of England to see the resolution of this dispute settled by Welsh Law was one of the reasons the principalities in the north of Wales were unable to unite in opposition to English hegemony and was a contributing factor to the final war between the Principality of Wales and England, which ultimately saw the end of Welsh independence. Edeirnion still exists as a "bro", or region, in Denbighshire, located around Corwen and near the Berwyn Range.
Edeirnion Rural District.
Edeirnion Rural District was created under the Local Government Act 1894 from that part of Corwen Rural Sanitary District which was in the former administrative county of Merionethshire. It consisted of six civil parishes and covered ; it continued in existence until 1974, when it was abolished, as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the Glyndŵr District of Clwyd. In 1901 it had a population of 5,132, which had fallen to 3,925 by 1961. It was the only part of Merionethshire not included in the Meirionnydd District of Gwynedd. In 1996 Edeirnion became part of Denbighshire.

Rivka Keren (born July 24, 1946) is an Israeli writer.
Biography.
Rivka Keren was born as Katalin Friedländer in Debrecen, Hungary. She immigrated with her parents and small brother to Israel in 1957. She has been writing since childhood, first in Hungarian, later in Hebrew. Studied painting in Jerusalem and New York, philosophy, literature and psychology in Bar Ilan University, graduated in Tel Aviv University (MA, clinical psychology).
Keren has worked as a librarian, art therapist and clinical psychologist. Exhibited her paintings in various countries. During these years, she had published books for children, adolescents, novels, short stories, translations and was included in numerous anthologies. Some of her books and short stories had been translated to German, English, Spanish, Russian, Hungarian, Braille (for the blind) and recorded on disks.
Keren is a member of PEN, ACUM and IPA.
She is married with two children.
Literary work.
Rivka Keren published so far fourteen books and four additional books are due to be published soon. Her work is dealing mostly with subject matters such as destiny, memory, identity, the mystery of love and evil and the dualism of immigrants. Keren’s writing is multi-layered and non-linear. The characters wander in a limbo between good and bad, love and hate, sanity and madness, while their state of mind meticulously analyzed. Their quests for belonging, roots and most of all truth and purpose, carry them to their goals through suffering and harsh experiences. Those of the novels that examine the characters against the black hole of the Holocaust were bestsellers and subject to much controversy among critics. In her writings, Rivka Keren, as second generation to Holocaust survivors, is representing the ongoing turmoil and conflict in the existence of immigrants, their pain and alienation but also their absorption and success. Her novels are a study of the human nature, the destructiveness of evil and revenge and the power of hope and love.

Ursus maritimus tyrannus is an extinct subspecies of bear, known from a single fragmentary ulna found in the gravels of the Thames at Kew Bridge, London. It was named by the Finnish paleontologist Björn Kurtén in 1964 and is interpreted to represent a relatively large subadult individual, the ulna is estimated to have been long when complete. Dating back to the Late Pleistocene, approximately 70,000 years ago, it is one of the oldest fossils assigned to the polar bear, however, recent reinvestigation of the fossil suggest brown bear affinities instead.

Independence Day (Niger)

Independence Day in the Republic of Niger is commemorated on August 3, marking the nation's independence from France in 1960. Since 1975, it is also Arbor Day, as trees are planted across the nation to aid the fight against desertification.
Importance of date.
August 3, 1960 is the date of formal, complete independence from France, while December 18, 1958 marks the founding of the Republic and creation of the Presidency of the Republic of Niger, following the constitutional changes of the French Fifth Republic, and the elections of 4 December 1958 held across The French Colonial possessions. Nigeriens consider that date to be the founding of their national institutions. Between December 18, 1958 and August 3, 1960, Niger remained a semi-autonomous Republic within the French Community. At the beginning of 1960 a revision of the French Community allowed membership of independent states, and on 28 July the Nigerien Legislative Assembly became the Nigerien National Assembly: Independence was declared on 3 August 1960.
Commemoration.
Since 1960, the 3rd has been a national festival. In 1975, the government began celebrating Independence Day, in part, through the coordinated mass planting of trees in order to fight desertification. The celebrations are also known as the "Fête de l'Arbre".
The 3rd is celebrated in Niger with official festivals and appearances of political leaders, an official broadcast by the President as well as the tradition (since 1975) that every Nigerien plant a tree. It is a Public Holiday, in which government offices and many businesses close.

Guildford Council election, 2007

The 2007 council elections in Guildford saw the Conservatives retain control over Guildford Borough Council. Full results for each ward can be found at Guildford Council election, full results, 2007.
Summary.
Going into the 2007 council election the net position was as follows. (The net position shown includes the gain by the Liberal Democrats of one seat from the Conservatives during the 2003-07 term, in the Merrow by-election of July 2003.)
After the election the position was as follows.
A more detailed analysis can pick out the following features
Labour Vote Down.
In the 2007 council election, the Labour vote slumped in Guildford. The party lost their last two remaining councillors. Only in two of the twenty two wards in Guildford (Stoke and Westborough) did any of the Labour candidates manage to get over 250 votes.
Stoke.
Stoke is the north east part of Guildford town, including Bellfields. Stoke ward elects two councillors. In 2003, the Labour councillors for Stoke, Keith Chesterton and Angela Gunning, had majorities over the third place candidate of 343 and 338 votes respectively. In the 2007 election, the Liberal Democrats gained both these Stoke seats. Keith Chesterton did not stand for reelection. Angela Gunning lost 47.7% of her vote and was pushed into 3rd place, more than 400 votes behind the second place candidate, Alan Muhammed.
Westborough.
Westborough ward is the name given to the west part of Guildford town including Park Barn. It is the other traditional Labour stronghold in Guildford. In 2003, the top placed Labour candidate had polled 1075 votes, 118 less than needed to be elected that year. By contrast, in 2007 the top Labour candidate managed only 308 votes, more than 1000 behind the number needed to get elected. As recently as early 2003, the Labour Party had held all three councillors for this ward, plus the county council electoral division for this area, called Guildford West.
Only Independent Councillor Does Not Stand in 2007.
Tillingbourne.
Tillingbourne is the name of the ward encompassing the surrounding countryside to the south east of Guildford borough, including Shere, Albury and St Martha’s. The only independent councillor on Guildford Borough Council between 2003 and 2007, Keith Childs, had been one of the two councillors for Tillingbourne. He did not seek reelection, in 2007. The Conservatives won the seat. The two Conservative candidates taking 67% and 63.9% of the vote respectively.
Net Gains for Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
The Conservatives gained one net seat compared to the position they had entering the election. The Liberal Democrats made a net gain of two seats.
The Conservatives gained one seat from an independent in Tillingbourne (discussed above). The Liberal Democrats gained two seats from Labour in the Stoke Ward (discussed above). 
In straight fights between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, each party gained two seats and lost two seats, leaving the net position unchanged. The Conservatives gained one seat in each of the Christchurch and Merrow wards, from the Liberal Democrats. The Liberal Democrats gained one seat in each of the Burpham and Onslow wards, from the Conservatives.

Oldest synagogues in the world

The designation oldest synagogue in the world requires careful definition. Many very old synagogues have been discovered in archaeological digs. Some synagogues have been destroyed and rebuilt several times on the same site, so, while the site or congregation may be ancient, the building may be modern. Still other very old synagogue buildings exist, but have been used for many centuries as churches, mosques, or for other purposes. And some very old synagogues have been in continuous use as synagogues for many centuries.
Worldwide.
An ancient Jewish synagogue has been discovered dating from the 4th or 3rd century BCE.
Standing buildings.
Two of the claimants to be the oldest structures still standing which were built as synagogues are the Erfurt Synagogue in Erfurt, Germany, which was built c. 1100 (see below), and Santa María la Blanca, built in Toledo, Spain in 1190. However neither has been used as a synagogue for centuries.
By Country.
Asia.
India.
The oldest of India's synagogue buildings can be found in the state of Kerala, where synagogue construction began during the medieval period. Whereas Kerala’s first Jewish houses of prayer said to be from the eleventh through the 13th centuries perished long ago as a consequence of natural disasters, enemy attacks, or the abandonment of buildings when congregations shifted, as did the earliest confirmed synagogue in Kochandagi authenticated to 1344 by a surviving building inscription now found in the courtyard of the Paradesi synagogue in Kochi's Jew Town, those originating from the 16th and 17th centuries subsist. These extant synagogues, though altered over time, include not only the oldest found on the Indian subcontinent but in the British Commonwealth. 
The consensus among historians based on a compilation of limited recorded history and a mélange of oral narratives is that first synagogues in Kerala were not built until the medieval period. Various Kerala Jews and the scholars who have studied the community believe that the earliest synagogues in the region date to the early 11th century. According to a narrative, a Kerala Jew by the name of Joseph Rabban who accepted on behalf of his community copper plates granting the local Jews a set of privileges by the Hindu leader Bhaskara Ravi Varman was also given wood by his Highness for the erection of a synagogue around 1000. While no physical evidence of this and any other similar period building survives, study of the literature, Jewish folksongs, and narratives supports the notion that synagogues likely stood in Malabar Coast towns, places now within the modern-day State of Kerala, from this epoch. A portion of these medieval-period buildings perished when the Kerala Jews had to leave them behind under the threat of persecution by the Moors and the Portuguese or as a result of natural disasters. The balance was rebuilt as a consequence of naturally occurring or intentionally set fires, modernization efforts, or assorted other variables (Waronker, Jay. The Synagogues of India. M. A. Thesis, Cornell University, 2010).
North America.
The Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island, is the oldest Jewish house of worship in North America that is still standing. It was built in 1759 for the Jeshuat Israel congregation, which was established in 1658.
South America and Caribbean.
Recife, Brazil.
The 3rd oldest synagogue in the Western Hemisphere was in St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands

Jeremiah James Colman

Jeremiah James Colman (14 June 1830–1898) was an English mustard manufacturer and the third member of the family in charge of the eponymous company Colman's. He was a popular philanthropist in his home town of Norwich and a Liberal politician who represented the city in parliament.
Biography.
Colman was the son of James Colman and his wife Mary Burlingham, daughter of John Burlingham of Old Buckenham. He became a partner in the family mustard business at Stoke Holy Cross in 1851 and from then on the company was called J. & J. Colman. In 1854, the firm employed 200 workers. Jeremiah James was responsible for moving the firm to the larger works at Carrow in 1856. The Carrow site had been bought from the Norwich Railway Company in 1850 and it was well served by road, rail and river transport. The massive expansion of Carrow Works brought steady employment to a depressed and stagnating city. By 1874 he was the master of 1,500 workers. He lived in Carrow House at the heart of the works, devoting his life to the firm and to public interests. In 1866 Jeremiah James Colman was appointed mustard maker to Queen Victoria. He also made it for Napoleon III of France, the Prince of Wales and Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. By 1893 the company had over 2,000 employees.
Colman served as a Norwich councillor from 1859 to 1871 becoming Sheriff in 1862 and Mayor in 1867. He was Leader of the Liberal party in the City, was elected as MP for Norwich in 1871 and held the seat until 1895. He was a City and County magistrate, Deputy Lieutenant in 1880 and an Alderman in 1896.
He served as Governor of Norwich School in 1858 and as its Chairman in 1890. He was a trustee of the Municipal Charities in 1856 and its Vice-Chairman from 1869 - 1872. In 1893 he was made an Honorary Freeman of the City.
He championed nonconformity, and persistently urged religious freedom. His generosity, kindness and courtesy gained him the affection and support not just of his business colleagues and employees but all who came into contact with him. On the day of his funeral the city came to a complete halt and thousands were in mourning. His large collection of historical documents about the city was given to the library by his great grandson and his paintings went to the Norwich Castle Museum
In 1856 he married Caroline Cozens-Hardy, the eldest daughter of William Hardy and Sarah Cozens of Letheringsett Hall, who changed their surnames by royal licence in 1842 to Cozens-Hardy. They had six children and after her elder son Russell James Colman recovered from a serious childhood illness in 1863, Caroline became closely associated with the work of the Jenny Lind Hospital for children. She gave her husband much support in his civic and parliamentary duties. She was the central figure behind all the welfare work for the employees of the company. A school was opened in King Street when the company moved to Carrow and in 1864 a new magnificent building was opened on Carrow Hill. The Carrow Works Dispensary was established in 1864 with a doctor and the first industrial nurse in the country. The company owned hundreds of properties around the city. Houses were provided for the workers at Carrow Close in Corton Road and Nightingale Cottages. In 1878, Lakenham Cricket Ground was bought to become not only the focus of Carrow sport, but also home to Norfolk County Cricket Club. After Caroline died in 1895 Jeremiah James Colman gave a new site for the hospital on the outskirts of the city in her memory. In 1899, the Carrow Works Pension Fund was introduced as a memorial to J.J. Colman.
When he was asked how he had made a fortune out of such a humble product, he replied "I make my money from the mustard that people throw away on the sides of their plate".

Rutgers Agricultural Field Day

Rutgers Agricultural Field Day is a farm-oriented event held at Rutgers University's Cook Campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey on the last Saturday of April. The event includes 4-H animal fairs, farm tours, plant sales, and department-specific exhibits such as the entomology department's cockroach races. The event is also known for BBQs and student parties, at which attendance peaked well over 20,000 people (Green Print, 1994—exact ref needed). It—and the New Jersey Folk Festival on the adjoining Douglass campus—still attract over 10,000 people annually. The next Ag Field Day will take place on April 28, 2012, as part of a larger Rutgers Day celebration.
History.
Started in 1906, "Ag Field Day" began as a way for farmers to learn about the NJ Agricultural Experiment Station's studies. It expanded to lectures, demonstrations and tours in 1917, and was later embraced by students as a party focal-point. By the mid-90's, university administration scaled back the evening party atmosphere to decrease attendance by non-students and curb underage drinking. The event's day-time activities continue unabated, and are open to all.

Opioid overdose

An opioid overdose is an acute condition due to excessive use of narcotics. It should not be confused with opioid dependency. Prescription opioid overdose was responsible for more deaths in the United States from 1999-2008 than heroin or cocaine overdose combined.
Symptoms.
Opiate overdose symptoms and signs include: decreased level of consciousness and pinpoint pupils. Heart rate and breathing slow down, sometimes to a stop. Blue lips and nails are caused by insufficient oxygen in the blood. Other symptoms include seizures and muscle spasms. A person experiencing an opiate overdose usually will not wake up even if their name is called or if they are shaken vigorously.
Prevention.
Although opioid overdose accounts for the leading cause of accidental death, it can be prevented and often in primary care settings. Providers should routinely screen patients using tools such as the CADE-AID and the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10) to screen adults and the CRAFT to screen adolescents aged 14–18 years. Other “drug seeking” behaviors as well as physical indications of drug use should be used as clues to perform formal screenings. Individuals diagnosed with opioid dependence should be prescribed naloxone to prevent overdose and/or should be directed to one of the many intervention/treatment options available, such as needle exchange programs and treatment centers. Brief motivational interviewing can also be performed by the clinician during patient visits and has been shown to improve patient motivation to change their behavior. Despite these opportunities, the dissemination of prevention interventions in the US has been hampered by the lack of coordination and sluggish federal government response.
Treatment.
Naloxone is very effective at reversing the cause, rather than just the symptoms, of an opioid overdose. A longer-acting variant is naltrexone. Naltrexone is primarily meant to treat opioid and alcohol dependence. Diprenorphine (Revivon) is similar in action to naloxone, only it is significantly stronger and is reserved for acting as an antagonist to the strongest, non-human opioids, such as carfentanyl (in fact, carfentanyl, and other opioids for usage on large animals such as elephants, often come packaged with Revivon to be used after carfentanyl is no longer needed in the animal).
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that US programs for drug users and their caregivers prescribing take-home doses of naloxone and training on its utilization are estimated to have reversed 10,000 opioid overdose deaths. Healthcare institution-based naloxone prescription programs have also helped reduce rates of opioid overdose in the US state of North Carolina, and have been replicated in the US military. Nevertheless, scale-up of healthcare-based opioid overdose interventions is limited by providers’ insufficient knowledge and negative attitudes towards prescribing take-home naloxone to prevent opioid overdose. Programs training police and fire personnel in opioid overdose response using naloxone have also shown promise in the US.
Co-ingestion.
Opioid overdoses associated with a conjunction of benzodiazepines or alcohol use leads to a contraindicated condition wherein higher instances of general negative overdose traits native to the overdose profile of opioid use alone but to a much greater extent. Other CNS depressants, or "downers", muscle relaxers, pain relievers, anti-convulsants, anxiolytics (anti-anxiety drugs), treatment drugs of a psychoactive or epileptic variety or any other such drug with its active function meant to calm or mitigate neuronal signaling (barbiturates, etc.) can additionally cause a worsened condition with less likelihood of recovery cumulative to each added drug of a diverse or disparate hampering effect to the central or peripheral nervous system of the user. This includes drugs less immediately classed to a slowing of the metabolism such as with GABAergics like GHB or glutamatergic antagonists like PCP or Ketamine.

National Basketball League.
Ratkovicz's pro career began when he was 19 years old, playing 13 games for the Chicago Bruins of the National Basketball League during the 1941–1942 season. Ratkovicz missed the next three seasons due to military service, then returned to Chicago in time for the 1945–1946 season, this time playing for the Chicago American Gears. He spent two seasons with the Gears, then went on to play for the NBL's Rochester Royals and Tri-Cities Blackhawks for one season apiece.

BodyLove

BodyLove is a radio soap opera in which the characters face common health problems and attempt to deal with them using practical solutions and healthier eating. Billed as "the soap opera that's good for you", "BodyLove" uses fictional drama to reach African American listeners with messages that promote healthy lifestyles. The program is based upon the principles of "entertainment-education" that have been recommended for reaching audiences not reached by traditional health education and health promotion messages.
The show is aimed at an African American audience which struggles with many of these health problems in disproportionate numbers. (For example, the diabetes death rate for blacks is more than double that for whites.) Betsy Hunter, executive director of the non-profit Media for Health, told "The Birmingham News", "If you can't entertain, you can't possibly change health behavior."
Summary.
In each weekly 15-minute episode, characters deal with a variety of health problems while trying to navigate personal relationships and deal with strains both financial and emotional. The drama revolves around characters who work and spend their time at a fictitious Birmingham, Alabama, beauty salon called "BodyLove". "BodyLove" focuses on the family of Vanessa Love, an African American woman in early middle-age who owns the salon and struggles with issues of diet, high blood pressure, weight gain, substance abuse, stress, and death. Vanessa is also raising three children with little help from her husband, a recovering alcoholic. The characters make progress through modest lifestyle changes.
History.
"BodyLove" was created by Dr. Connie Kohler, a public-health professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The show began in 2002 as a single 10-episode series on Birmingham station WJLD (1400 AM). It quickly expanded in scope and affiliate coverage to a multi-year saga heard in all of Alabama's population centers.
The first 80 episodes of "BodyLove" aired across the state of Alabama in four 20-episode seasons between 2003 and 2007. After a fundraising break, Kohler and her partners resumed writing and producing new episodes, which began airing in late 2008 after local stations cycled through reruns of the earlier seasons. The show's episodes were written by UAB faculty and UAB students in screen-writing classes taught by Lee Shackleford.
"BodyLove" is currently a project of Media for Health and the UAB School of Public Health. Media for Health is a private non-profit organization formed in September 2006 to produce, promote, and distribute "BodyLove". Funding for "BodyLove" is provided by local and national charitable foundations, in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Local Initiative Funding Partners Program.
Presentation.
On most affiliate stations, each episode is followed by a 45-minute talk period where listeners may speak to local health experts and get information about local health resources. For example, on WJUS in Marion, Alabama, the program is hosted locally by registered nurse Frances Ford who bookends the show with a listener call-in show offering advice, support, and "practical steps to better health". Since nearly one-third of Perry County residents live in poverty, Ford tailors her on-air nutrition tips to suit local budgets. On WJJN in Dothan, Alabama, the call-in program following each episode is hosted by Dr. Harriett Searcy, medical director at the Alfred Saliba Family Services Center's Family Health Clinic.
Affiliates.
Stations in Alabama that have broadcast "BodyLove" include WEUP-FM and WEUV in Huntsville, WHBB in Selma, WHIY in Moulton, WJDB in Thomasville, WJJN in Dothan, WJLD in Birmingham, WJUS in Marion, WMFC in Monroeville, WRJX in Jackson, WSYA in Anniston, WTLS in Tallassee, WTSK in Tuscaloosa, WVAS in Montgomery, and WZZA in Tuscumbia. The show is also carried by stations in Atlanta, Georgia, Jackson, Mississippi, and Port St. Lucie, Florida.
Off the air, the episodes can be streamed online from the website of WBHJ in Birmingham, Alabama.
Cast.
The cast, which includes professional and amateur actors, performs under the direction of the chairman of the University of Alabama at Birmingham's theater department. Listed alphabetically by character name:
The future.
Kohler and her partners are working on new episodes of "BodyLove", as well as an upcoming three-minute show focusing on obesity. That series is set to air on radio stations in urban areas with large African American populations and will be funded in part by the National Institutes of Health.

New York Foundling

The New York Foundling, founded in 1869 by the Roman Catholic Sisters of Charity, is one of New York City’s oldest and largest child welfare agencies. The Foundling operates programs in the five boroughs of New York City, Rockland County, and Puerto Rico. Its services include foster care, adoptions, and other community-based services for families.
History.
The Foundling Asylum (1869–1881).
A wave of very poor immigrants and social disruption were among the many social conditions that led to an epidemic of infanticide during the late 1860s. In reaction, Sister Irene Fitzgibbons, Founding Sister of The New York Foundling, placed a white wicker cradle on the doorstep of a small rented house she called "The Foundling Asylum" at 17 East 12th Street in New York’s Greenwich Village, with the goal of receiving and caring for unwanted children and those whose parents could not properly care for them. The first abandoned baby arrived on October 11, 1869, and 45 more babies followed in that first month. The need for this type of service was confirmed by the 126 babies that were left by January 1, 1870. After two years, The Foundling had accepted 2,500 babies. The New-York Historical Society has a collection of the notes left with the abandoned babies.
As the number of babies left increased and the children already in their care grew older, the Sisters of Charity moved to a larger building and began participating in a social program that placed children with approved families in various rural regions of the United States. Parishioners in the destination regions were asked to accept children, and parish priests provided applications to approved families. This practice was first known as the "Baby Train", then later the "Orphan Train." By the 1910s 1,000 children a year were placed with new families.
The Foundling Hospital (1880–1957).
In response to an increasing need for skilled medical and nursing care for mothers and children, The New York Foundling began providing health services in addition to social services, changing its name to The New York Foundling Hospital to more accurately reflect its services.
Among its medical programs was St. Ann’s Hospital (opened 1880), which provided unmarried mothers with medical treatment; and St. John’s Hospital for Sick Children (1881), which was at the forefront of developing pediatric practices and approaches to caring for children in a hospital setting. The practice of intubation was invented by Founding Hospital staff member Dr. Joseph O'Dwyer. This method of keeping airways open saved thousands of children from the life-threatening disease diphtheria, an epidemic at the time. Beginning in 1945, The Foundling also operated a developmental clinic to observe, examine and analyze the developmental norms for young children. The clinic became a learning center for students from New York City area medical schools, nursing schools and psychology departments. These programs were the beginning of, and were subsequently incorporated into, what became Saint Vincent’s Hospital in New York City.
While The Foundling provided medical treatment in addition to adoption and support services for mothers-in-need, it wasn’t until the 1930s that a Social Service department was established to assist those who could not properly care for their children.
Programs, services and initiatives.
Foster care and adoption.
As one of the City’s largest and most highly regarded foster care service providers, The New York Foundling is responsible for more than 1,400 children who are living in individual and specialized foster boarding homes or in group residential settings. Each year, more than 120 of The Foundling’s foster parents adopt their foster children. Prospective parents are carefully screened to ensure the best interests of the child.
Vincent J. Fontana Center for Child Protection.
The Vincent J. Fontana Center for Child Protection was founded in 1998 by Doctor Vincent J. Fontana, who served as medical director of The Foundling for over 40 years. The Fontana Center is dedicated to furthering the understanding and detection of child abuse and neglect, and to teaching prevention and treatment.
Mott Haven Academy Charter School.
In 2008, The Foundling opened the Mott Haven Academy Charter School. Haven Academy opened with 90 students in kindergarten and first grade, and is expected to eventually serve 314 students in grades K-8. Haven Academy was designed to meet the needs of at-risk students currently in the foster care and child welfare system. The plan is to co-locate all of The Foundling’s Bronx-based community services into an academic complex with Haven Academy to integrate social services and the school's academic program. The school is currently operating at a temporary location (PS 43) in Mott Haven. During year two, the school will move to its permanent facility.
The New York Foundling today.
The Foundling’s administrative headquarters are located at 590 Avenue of the Americas, in Chelsea. The building opened in 1988 and houses some Foundling programs such as providing a residence for young expectant mothers and those with infants as well as preventitive services for families who are deaf and hard-of-hearing. Other Foundling programs operate directly out of the communities they serve throughout New York City and Rockland County, an approach highly encouraged by the city’s Administration for Children’s Services.

Paradise Grove

Paradise Grove is an independent 2003 black comedy filmed in London. Much of the film is based in a fictional Jewish retirement home. It stars Ron Moody and Rula Lenska. It was directed by Charles Harris and was his first feature film.
Synopsis.
A quirky film about life, death, and the bit in the middle, Paradise Grove is a beguiling blend of tragedy, romance, and wry Jewish wit. Set in an eccentric north London Jewish old age home, the film revolves around three generations of the same family. There's cantanerous old Izzie Goldberg (Ron Moody), who's dying and is not at all happy about it, his hedonistic daughter Dee (Rula Lenska), the home's owner, a cross between a Sixties flower child and a traditional Jewish mother—and there's her teenage age son Keith (Leyland O'Brien), the mixed-race outcome of a disastrous marriage. Keith's identity crisis forms the film's emotional core: he's trying to build personal and religious bridges with his grandfather while starting a relationship with the mysterious Kim (Lee Blakemore), who turns up one morning looking for shelter, and who offers the promise of a life outside Paradise Grove. He'd love to get away from his domineering mother but can he abandon Izzie? And why does Kim keep a loaded gun in her handbag?

Regina Trench

Regina Trench () was a German trench dug along a ridge running from north-west of the village of Le Sars, south-west to Stuff Redoubt (), close to the German fortifications at Thiepval on the Somme battlefield. It was the longest such trench on the German front during the First World War. Attacked several times during the Battle of the Ancre Heights, the 5th Canadian Brigade briefly controlled a section of the trench on 1 October but were repulsed by counter attacks. An attack on 8 October by the 1st and 3rd Canadian Divisions on Regina Trench also failed; on 21 October the 4th Canadian Division attacked the trench as the 18th, 25th and 39th divisions attacked the western part of the trench, (known as "Stuff Trench") and briefly gained footholds but were again pushed out by German counter-attacks.
Action.
After two months of attacks and constant shelling the trench was taken by a night attack on 10/11 November by the 4th Canadian Division. The 46th (S. Saskatchewan) and 47th (Br. Columbia) battalions of the 10th Brigade, with a company of the 102nd Battalion, crept close to the line and attacked eight minutes after the barrage lifted, surprising the German garrison and taking and four machine-guns, for a loss of ; several German counter-attacks were defeated.

Most of the men buried at Regina Trench fell in battle between October 1916 and February 1917 and the original portion of the cemetery (now Plot II, Rows A to D) was established during the winter of 1916–1917. After the armistice in 1918 the Regina Trench location was selected as a "concentration cemetery" with mortal remains brought in from scattered graves and small battlefield cemeteries surrounding the nearby villages of Courcelette, Grandcourt and Miraumont. Unlike many CWGC cemeteries where men are laid one-to-a-grave, many of the graves contain more than one burial and where two names are shown on the one headstone, it is necessary to count the individual names in order to find the correct grave location. The CWGC website states that Regina Trench Cemetery is located in Grandcourt but this is somewhat misleading because while it is located between Grandcourt and Courcelette it is most easily reached by a rough road that runs approximately northwest of Courcelette village.

The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity

The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures () is a 1985 book by Jürgen Habermas, who reconstructs and deals in depth with a number of philosophical approaches to the critique of modern reason and the Enlightenment "project" since Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Nietzsche, including the work of 20th century philosophers Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Martin Heidegger, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Cornelius Castoriadis and Niklas Luhmann. The work is regarded as an important contribution to Frankfurt School critical theory. It has been characterized as a critical (largely negative) evaluation of the concept of world disclosure in modern philosophy.
The work was translated into English by Frederick Lawrence in 1987.
Summary.
In the first chapter, “Modernity’s Consciousness of Time,” Habermas presents an outline of the “cultural self-understanding of modernity” as it emerged in Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and attempts to retrieve the “historical context of Western rationalism” in which modernity or modernization (more narrowly conceived in terms of social and economic transformation) was originally understood as both a process of disenchantment and alienation "as well as" the “historical objectification of rational structures.” This presentation prepares the ground for the larger argument of the book, namely, that by losing sight of the “cultural impulse of modernity,” and abandoning the project of modernity as a whole, European intellectuals on both ends of the political spectrum have ignored the emancipatory dimension of the European Enlightenment, and thereby have renounced the only means of developing a consistent and immanent critique of modernity itself.
Modernity is defined by Habermas as a set of problems related to the issue of time, problems produced by the transformation of European society in accordance with what Hegel called the “principle of subjectivity,” the notion of individual autonomy as the essence of man. This freedom from all forms of external authority, which includes nature as well as tradition, means that the subject “has to create its normativity out of itself;” because it is free, it cannot accept any value or law that it does not recognize as its own. Subjectivity, in other words, is defined by “the right to criticism: the principle of the modern world requires that what anyone is to recognize shall reveal itself to him as something entitled to recognition." Insofar as the subject wills only those laws that recognizes as rational, laws which are “self-proscribed and self-obligated,” the subject wills only itself, or, in Hegel terms, it “wills the Will:” “The Will is Free only when it does not will anything alien, extrinsic, foreign to itself (as long as it does so, it is dependent), but wills itself alone – wills the Will. This is the absolute Will – the volition to be free.”
According to Habermas, Nietzsche undertakes a critique of “subject-centered reason,” of modern forms of knowledge and ethics, from a standpoint that only appears to be “genealogical,” that is, situated, historically, outside of modernity and Enlightenment thinking in an archaic, Dionysian era of myth, prior to the formation of modern subjectivity in the renunciation of instinct or “life.” He sees Nietzsche’s argument that all moral and cognitive claims (along with the rational subject) are the historical products of a power forced inward by its inability to discharge itself not as being based on a genealogy of modernity, but rather as a critique of the modern cognitive and practical subject from the perspective of an equally modern aesthetics (which Nietzsche “transposes,” according to Habermas, “into the archaic”), elevating the “judgment of taste of the art critic into a model for value judgment.” Nietzsche's critique of subject, in other words, is based on a modern aesthetic experience – in particular, the “painful de-differentiation, a de-delimitation of the individual, a merging with amorphous nature within and without” – which presupposes the modern subject itself. What appears, then, in Nietzsche as the historical “other” reason is in fact a version of Kantian aesthetics shorn of any claim of intersubjective validity.

Togger Johnson

Peter 'Togger' Johnson.
Patrick "Togger" Johnson is a fictional character in CBBC's long series drama "Grange Hill". The character is played by Chris Perry-Metcalf. He is the nephew of former student, Peter "Tucker" Jenkins.
History.
When Togger started in Grange Hill in year 7 he found himself to be a prankster with best mates Abel and Andy. Pranking school headmaster MrMcdonald and arch rival Tanya Young.
In year 8 Togger hears about the Grange Hill time capsule from Uncle Peter and is determined to find it. Wally catches the lads digging up the school lawn; and the quest lands them in trouble during cross-country. Togger and Abel interview Bill Winston, the oldest surviving Grange Hill pupil, for their class presentation. They do not bother to do any work and discover Bill has died when they make a return visit. Togger agonises whether to tell Andy about Emma, and when events overtake them Andy is furious Togger kept quiet.
In year 9 Togger worries he'll be seriously embarrassed by little brother Tigger and his worries prove justified after an eventful Year 7 induction day. Togger is devastated when he fails to get into the football academy, but the demands it places on Abel almost destroys their friendship. Togger rescues Tanya from her abductor and the pair begin to develop an understanding.
In year 10 it's another hectic year for Togger, he, Andy and Abel find themselves locked in a shed full of wild animals when Togger should be in "detention" filming a wedding video with Tanya. Togger is challenged to improve the state of the school toilets; no-one is interested in his crusade and even Andy tells him to throw in the towel. At the end of the year brand-spanking new loos are opened - Togger is pleased with himself. Tanya is elected school rep unopposed when Togger nominates her. Togger and Tanya share a tender moment on the last day of term; Tanya waits for him after school but he's too busy sorting out Tigger's scrape with Mooey. As Tanya walks off into the sunset, Togger is gutted at missing his chance.
Year 11 proves to be Togger’s most traumatic year at Grange Hill. As if having Tigger at the same school weren’t bady enough his sister Lucy has now joined them and to make matters worse she instantly takes a disliking to Tanya’s sister Jenny which causes friction between Togger and Tanya. Andy then announces that his parents have withdrawn him from Grange Hill to send him to private school and get him away from Togger whom they consider a bad influence. Tanya meanwhile seems to be dating an older guy much to Togger’s chagrin. In an attempt to get Tanya out of his system Togger turns his attentions to Anna Duncan, a year nine girl. At first things seem to go well but when Togger thinks that Baz Wainwright is showing an interest as well he sees history repeating itself after Baz’s brief relationship with Tanya the previous year. Togger starts to show resentment and jealousy towards Baz which culminates in football practice when Togger takes his anger out on Baz with a bad tackle which sends Baz crashing to the ground where he stays. When Mr MacDonald examines him he finds that Baz has died. Togger is mortified by what he believes to be the result of his actions and stays away from school for several days unable to face people, especially Baz’s girlfriend Holly and best mate Donny Briscoe who blames Togger for Baz’s death. Tanya goes to see Togger and the two have a heart to heart which seems to bring them closer. She persuades Togger to return to school but despite the post-mortem showing that Baz’s death was nothing to do with Togger but rather a heart defect Donny and several others still blame Togger. Towards the end of the year Togger decides to make a clean break at the end of the year and get away from Grange Hill when his Uncle Peter (Tucker Jenkins) offers him a job on a building site in Germany. He begins to rethink however when he and Tanya share a kiss. On the last day of school Togger is shocked when he is awarded the new Baz Wainwright trophy and Donny finally admits he was wrong for blaming Togger for Baz’s death. Togger and Tanya attend the prom together officially as boyfriend and girlfriend and Togger decides to stay on at Grange Hill for sixth form.

Tennessee Ramblers (Tennessee band)

The Tennessee Ramblers were an American old-time string band originally consisting of William "Fiddlin' Bill" Sievers (1875—1954) on fiddle, his son James "Mack" Sievers on banjo and vocals, daughter Willie Sievers (1909—1998) on guitar, and cousin Walter McKinney (d. 1960) on steel guitar. The band was one of the most popular performing groups in East Tennessee during the 1920s through the 1940s, gaining initial fame as a backing band in fiddle contests held at Market Hall in Knoxville, Tennessee, and later performing at fairs and other gatherings around the eastern United States. They recorded several sides for Brunswick/Vocalion in 1928 and 1929, which were issued on the Vocalion label. After the death of William Sievers in 1954, siblings James and Willie formed a Hawaiian music group known as Mack's Novelty Hawaiians. Willie Sievers' guitar solos recorded with the band in 1928 and 1929 are among the first by a female lead guitarist in Country music.
Origins.
William Sievers (the name is sometimes spelled "Seivers") was born in Elza, Tennessee (now part of Oak Ridge) in 1875 and worked as a barber in nearby Clinton, where James and Willie were born in 1904 and 1909, respectively. William's grandfather and mother had been fiddle players, and his children later recalled that most everyone in the family played an instrument of some sort. William's wife, Myrtle McKinney, occasionally sang with the band in its early years. Aside from his parents, William's influences included an obscure Knoxville fiddle player known as "Old Bill" Jones (Georgia fiddler Earl Johnson also claimed Jones as an influence) and a Knoxville blues group known as the "Kinser Brothers." 
James Sievers began playing banjo with his cousin, Walter McKinney, in 1913, and learned much of his technique from a north Anderson County banjo player named Steve Cole. Willie initially took piano lessons, but quit after her instructor told her she would only learn an instrument by "playing it by ear." She took up guitar shortly thereafter, and would later go on to win several contests. Within a few years, James and his sister Willie were playing at school assemblies. The two developed what would become a lifelong interest in Hawaiian music during this period, at the same time learning old-time music their father taught them.
Career.
William Sievers and his two children formed the Tennessee Ramblers in 1922. Walter McKinney typically appeared with the band playing steel guitar or Hawaiian guitar. James chose the name "Tennessee Ramblers" one night while they were driving to a show in Virginia. Throughout the 1920s, the band played at various venues across the eastern United States. They appeared on numerous radio stations, including WNOK in Knoxville, WLW in Cincinnati, and WFJC in Akron. At the fiddler conventions held by Frank Murphy at Market Hall in Knoxville, the Tennessee Ramblers were often paired with fiddlers Charlie Bowman and Earl Johnson. 
In February 1928, the Tennessee Ramblers recorded their first record at a Brunswick session in Ashland, Kentucky. The recordings included "Cackling Pullet," which is based on the traditional tune "Hen Cackle," and "Fiddler Contest," which includes a guitar solo by Willie and a banjo solo by James. The session also produced "Preacher Got Drunk and Laid His Bible Down," which, as the chorus suggests, is based on the 1909 Robert Hoffman song, "I'm Alabama Bound." 
In August 1929, Brunswick began the first of a series of large-scale recording sessions at the St. James Hotel in Knoxville. At this session, the Tennessee Ramblers recorded "Ramblers March," which was written by James, and "Garbage Can Blues," which they typically used to open performances. The group recorded several sides at Brunswick's follow-up Knoxville session in April of the following year, but no recordings from this session were released. Willie, however, is believed to have supplied the brief guitar solo on "Uncle Jimmy's Favorite Fiddlin' Pieces", recorded at the same session by fiddler Uncle Jimmy Thompson of Grand Ole Opry fame.
Later years.
In 1931, Walter McKinney left the group and moved to the western United States. He was replaced by a mandolin player named Jerry Taylor, who played with the Ramblers throughout the 1930s. In 1938, the Ramblers also added J.T. Jones. The band continued playing at various gatherings around the region, including a large concert in St. Petersburg, Florida in 1932, and continued playing various venues in downtown Knoxville. 
The Tennessee Ramblers disbanded with the death of William Sievers in 1954. The following year, James and Willie decided to focus on Hawaiian music, and formed a band called "Mack's Novelty Hawaiians." This band, which included Jo Adkins on drums, played regularly in downtown Knoxville through the 1970s.

The Gesture of Rufina Alfaro

The start of the Panamanian independence was on November 10, 1821 when the population of Los Santos rose up against Spanish rulers. It has the tradition that the head of this revolt for freedom was Rufina Alfaro, a young lady of the town, who became the symbol of national independence.
Although her existence is disputed, she is part of the popular memory and even is an official symbol of the country and a monument in her memory has been erected in the town of La Villa de los Santos. In fact, in the celebration of the Independence Day in 2002, the country's president, Mireya Moscoso, deposited a wreath in front of the bust of the heroine, during a few events that involved the music band called Rufina Alfaro. 
On her memory, in the province of Panama, in the district of San Miguelito, there is a place called Rufina Alfaro.
Some biographical Panamanians dictionaries even venture to say who this young lady was:
Rufina Alfaro, about 22 years was the one who created the strategy that was used in the destruction of the police fortress, the only breadwinner of the Spanish colonial government. With Black eyes, hair of the same color, suntan skin, high and thin. Born in Las Peñas, a district of Los Santos. Her date of birth is unknown, but it is known that she lived with her parents, and that they were in the business of raising chickens for sale and agriculture. She knew how to read and write and ordinarily dressed in basquiña *a Typical dress of that time*. The village was two miles away and she worked on the trade of eggs and vegetables in the village. Won the sympathy of the Spanish soldiers, because in addition to its beautiful presence, she was distinguished by her fine manners and cheerful talk that allowed her to entry in the elegant salons of society. She knew the deep popular resentment against the Crown and that was what convinced her that she should act quickly to support the quest for independence. By that time the persecution began, the press was muzzled and Panamanians that talked about freedom were threatened. Many hid, and others remained silent. The head of the barracks, who believed to find his love in Rufina, he allowed her the entrance to the hall to chat, but she used these meetings to obtain information. She felt sympathy for the soldier, related Horacio Moreno, in the Journal Lottery, however, drowned her feelings in search of the freedom of her people. Upon instructions of the people that were preparing the epic, she warned they that the Spanish soldiers were cleaning their weapons and Rufina rather than go out and sell as was his custom, joined the improvised soldiers, leading a march in which she shouted " Viva la Libertad. " Took the barracks with stones and sticks; weapons remained in the hands of the people and at dawn of November 10, 1821, they had already achieved the desired freedom, without spilling a single drop of blood.
There are those who argue her existence and those who speak that she was the product of the popular imagination. The debate has even gone to the parliament of this country, but the fact is that she is part of the history of Panama.

Jennifer Carroll

Jennifer Sandra Carroll (née Johnson; born August 27, 1959) is a Trinidadian-born American politician who was the 18th Lieutenant Governor of the U.S. state of Florida. The first black American and the first woman elected to the position, she assumed the office on January 4, 2011. She was the first black person elected lieutenant governor of Florida, and the first black person elected to statewide office in Florida since Reconstruction. Carroll previously served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2003 until 2010. 
The "New York Times" reported that Carroll's tenure as lieutenant governor was "marred by scandal and poor judgment" and she was "increasingly viewed as an embarrassment to the man who chose her for the job." She resigned her post as lieutenant governor on March 12, 2013, following allegations that she was involved in an effort to steer money into Internet cafés that are fronts for gambling, the subject of federal and state criminal investigations.
Early life, education, and early political career.
Carroll was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. She moved to the United States at the age of eight, and graduated from Uniondale High School in Uniondale, New York in 1977. Carroll enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1979. After serving as an aviation machinist's mate (jet engine mechanic), she was selected for the Enlisted Commissioning Program, becoming an Aviation Maintenance Officer in 1985. She retired from the Navy in 1999 as a Lieutenant Commander. In 1981, she received an Associate of Arts degree from Leeward Community College. She followed this in 1985 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science from the University of New Mexico. She moved to Florida in 1986. She received a Master of Business Administration degree from unaccredited and now defunct Kensington University in 1995. Carroll resigned her position on the National Commission of Presidential Scholars after a CBS investigation raised questions about her degree. She then returned to school to earn an accredited Master of Business Administration degree online from St. Leo University in 2008.
Carroll is a member of the Clay County Republican Executive Committee. In 2000, she ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in the Florida's 3rd congressional district. Incumbent Democrat U.S. Congresswoman Corrine Brown defeated Carroll 58%–42%. After redistricting, she ran for a rematch against Brown in the newly redrawn 3rd district in 2002. Brown defeated her 59%–41%. In both elections, Carroll ran more strongly than Republicans usually poll in the area.
Following her defeat in the 2000 election, she was appointed as Executive Director of the Florida Department of Veterans Affairs by Republican Governor Jeb Bush and served in that post until July 2002. Republican President George W. Bush appointed Carroll to the Commission on Presidential Scholars from 2001 to 2004, and then a seat on the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission from 2004 to 2007.
Florida House of Representatives.
Elections.
Carroll ran for a seat Florida House of Representatives in the 13th state House district after incumbent State Representative Mike Hogan, also a Republican, resigned in 2003. In the April 2003 special election, she won the Republican primary with 65.5 percent of the vote, defeating Linda Sparks, who won 34.5 percent of the vote. She became the first African-American female Republican ever elected to the Florida Legislature. She won unopposed in 2004, 2006, and 2008.

Caroll was appointed Deputy Majority Leader from 2003–2004, and served as Majority Whip in 2004–2006. She was Vice Chair of the Transportation and Economic Development Committee (2003–2004), Chair of the Finance Committee (2006–2008) and Chair of the Economic and Development Council (2008–2010).
2010 gubernatorial election.
On September 2, 2010, Republican primary winner Rick Scott named Carroll his running mate in the 2010 Florida gubernatorial election, after Toni Jennings and Susan Story declined the job. He said that she is the "embodiment of the American Dream" and that their ticket is a "clear choice between conservatives with business experience and a plan to create 700,000 jobs and liberal Obamacrats who want to bring the failed Obama agenda to Florida." Carroll thus became the first black woman to be a major party candidate for lieutenant governor in the general election in Florida's history, and the first black woman on any statewide Republican ticket. Scott and Carroll won the election, and assumed office on January 4, 2011. She is the first woman elected and the second woman to hold the position of lieutenant governor, following Toni Jennings who was appointed in 2003 to finish the term of Frank Brogan.
Controversies and resignation.
A 2011 story in the Florida Times-Union reported that Carroll's Clay County business "3N & JC" used falsified documents in a Jacksonville grant program to meet the requirement that her minority-owned firm was located in Jacksonville. 
In July 2012, a fired former staffer of the Lieutenant Governor's office, Carletha Cole, included allegations of "sex, lies and illegal audio taping" against Carroll as part of Cole's defense in a criminal case. Cole attempted to have Carroll impeached, and both sides waged a public relations battle, alternately characterizing Cole as "an innocent whistleblower under attack or as a disgruntled former employee carrying out a vicious vendetta."
On March 12, 2013 Carroll resigned from office over a federal gambling racketeering case in which she has been questioned about the previous day by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Carroll once owned public relations firm, "3N & JC" that represented Allied Veterans, and she did work for the company at the same time she served in the Florida House. Allied veterans and associates of the organization are under investigation. Chief of staff for Governor Rick Scott, Adam Hollingsworth, told the press that: "Lt. Gov. Carroll resigned in an effort to keep her former affiliations with the company from distracting from the administration’s important work on behalf of Florida families. She made the right decision for the state and her family."
Personal life.
Carroll is married to Nolan Carroll and has three children. Her son, Nolan Carroll II, played college football for the University of Maryland, and is now a member of the Miami Dolphins.

Maurice L. Albertson

Maurice Lee "Maury" "Quickshot" Albertson (August 30, 1918 – January 11, 2009), PhD, civil engineer, a teacher of water resources management over a long career (starting in 1947) at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado and former head of the Colorado State University Research Foundation.
Biography.
He was born and grew up in Hays, Kansas. There he learned from his father about helping others in a rural environment and living a life based on the Sermon on the Mount. Having witnessed economic hardship at the time of the Great Depression and seeing the effect of prolonged drought, he was inspired to focus on water resources. Albertson eventually headed all research projects at CSU. He received a B.S. degree from Iowa State University, Ames, earned M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mechanics and hydraulics from The University of Iowa, and received a D.Phys.Sc. degree from the University of Grenoble in France. His first wife, Dolly (Myrtle Marie Campbell originally of Waterloo, IA), died in 1976. His second wife, Audrey Faulkner, who survived him, is co-author on some of his publications.
Albertson has been credited with changing the face of U.S. volunteerism. He recalled that the phone rang at 2 AM on a 1961 morning, and that when he answered he found himself talking to Sargent Shriver, first director of the Peace Corps. Shriver was calling to ask him about a CSURF study on creating a youth volunteer group. Shriver apologized for the hour, but said he'd been working on the program all night and had worked his way to Albertson on his list of people to call. He wanted Albertson to come to Washington immediately. The CSURF research Albertson oversaw was used in setting up the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps remained true to the original vision in Albertson's opinion.
Albertson served as a consultant to the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, USAID, UNESCO, and other agencies. His focuses have included water resource development, environmental engineering, water and sanitation, on-farm water management, village development, appropriate technology, and small industry development. Climate change has recently been one of his concerns.His honors include: American Society of Civil Engineers, J. C. Stevens Award; Emil Hilgard Prize; Croes Medal; CSU Centennial Professor and Public Service Award; Peshawar University of Pakistan, Honorary Doctor of Laws; Asian Institute of Technology, Honorary Doctor of Technology; Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters, Lowell University; Colorado Governor’s Award of Merit for Science and Technology; honorary doctorate from Colorado State University; National Society of Professional Engineers Engineer of the Year; Iowa State University Professional Achievement Award. Albertson also received the E-chievement Award from etown, a weekly NPR radio broadcast. The award honors noteworthy individuals who are working hard to make a positive difference in their communities and beyond. He was president and co-founder of Village Earth, the Consortium for Sustainable Village-Based Development, and worked almost until the moment of his death on plans for the organization. He has more than 200 publications. He was honored in the U.S. Senate on the occasion of his 90th birthday.

Decatur Cemetery

The Decatur Cemetery is a historic graveyard within the City of Decatur, Georgia.
History.
The Decatur Cemetery is the oldest burial ground in the Metro Atlanta Area, and is believed to have been used even before Decatur's 1823 incorporation. In 1852, an act by the local legislature created “Commissioners for the Decatur Burial Ground.” Numerous Civil War veterans were buried in the Decatur Cemetery, mostly in the region now referred to as, "The Old Cemetery". The Cemetery's "Well House" was built in 1881.
The Cemetery Today.
The Decatur Cemetery has expanded to and contains well over 20,000 graves. A special section exists for cremated burials, the Cemetery also contains a pond stocked with fish. This pond is also home to swans, ducks and turtles, and is a stopping place for canada geese on migration. The Cemetery is bordered by a several acre forest, which borders the Glennwood Estates (Decatur) neighborhood.
The Forest.
The forested ravine east of the cemetery includes a newly completed pedestrian path that winds over a branch of Peachtree Creek. A small, but lovely waterfall is just south of the southern bridge.
The Bamboo Grove.
At the southeast corner of the cemetery is found a rather surprising grove of giant bamboo, some with trunks over 20cm in diameter. A short path leads through this grove to the end of the Ponce de Leon Court Historic District.

Hungarian–Romanian War

The Hungarian–Romanian War was fought between the Hungarian Soviet Republic and the Kingdom of Romania from November 1918 until March 1920 with the main military operations ending in August 1919.
At the end of 1918, the final year of World War I, the collapse of Austria-Hungary led to the declaration of Union of Transylvania with Romania. The Romanians wanted to ensure the success of their territorial demands in the coming Peace Conference and to help the national aspirations of the Transylvanian Romanians. The crown council in Bucharest decided in favor of an attack and in April 1919 the Romanians launched a powerful offensive along the entire Hungarian-Romanian demarcation line which was set according to the Belgrade Armistice of 1918. The Paris Conference decisions of moving forward the Hungarian–Romanian demarcation line was unacceptable to the Hungarian government, which resigned. The Bolsheviks took power and wanted to make good on their promise to protect Hungary's borders withstanding the Entente's further demand of territorial concessions.
During the war the Hungarian Red Army also fought against troops from Czechoslovakia, though not simultaneously with the Romanians, and Yugoslavian forces occupied Hungary up to Pécs. In the war's first phase, the Romanian Army advanced against light resistance up to the Western Carpathian Mountains. In the second phase they overcame the Hungarian Red Army to reach the Tisza river. Finally, in the third phase, they defeated the Hungarian Army and occupied Budapest (August 1919), ousting the communist regime of Béla Kun. The Entente was discontent with the Romanian conduct during much of its conflict with Hungary.
Background.
Hungary.
In 1918 the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy collapsed as a result of losing World War I. On October 31, 1918, the success of the Aster Revolution in Budapest brought the left-liberal Count Mihály Károlyi, an Entente devotee, to power as Prime Minister. He yielded to Woodrow Wilson's pacifism by ordering the full disarmament of the Hungarian Army the Serbians occupying Pécs as soon as November 14. The armistice limited the size of the Hungarian army to six infantry and two cavalry Divisions
By February 1919 the Károlyi government had lost all popular support, having failed on domestic and military fronts. On March 21, after the Entente military representative demanded more and more territorial concessions from Hungary, Károlyi turned over the government to the Socialist Party of Hungary, a coalition of Social Democrats and Communists. Although Károlyi believed he was handing power to the Social Democrats, it was the Communists, led by Béla Kun, who were actually in control. The new government proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic and promised equality and social justice.
The Hungarian Soviet Government proposed that Hungary be restructured as a federation. The proposal was intended to appeal to both domestic and foreign opinion. Domestic considerations included maintaining the territorial integrity and economic unity of the former crown lands, and protecting the nation's borders via a patriotic war. The government had popular support, especially from the army. Most of the officers of the Hungarian army originated from areas that had been forcibly occupied by states bordering Hungary and this circumstance heightened its patriotic mood. In light of President Wilson's doctrine of self-determination of peoples, the proposed federation was also intended to appeal to foreign opinion as a solution to the country's multi-ethnic composition. The dominance of Hungary's Magyars would be lessened by allowing self-government and self-directed institutions for the non-Magyar peoples of Hungary.
The Communists, or "Reds", came to power largely thanks to being the only group with an organized fighting force, and to their promising that Hungary would defend its territory without conscription (possibly with the help of the Soviet Red Army). Initially, most soldiers of Hungary's Red Army were armed factory workers from Budapest. Later the Hungarian Red Army became a truly national army, the ranks of which were motivated by patriotism rather than ideology.
Romania.
In 1916, Romania entered World War I on the side of the Entente, with the main goal of uniting all territories with a Romanian national majority into one state (see Treaty of Bucharest (1916)). In 1918, after the communists took power in Russia and signed a separate peace in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers, Romania was left alone on the Entente's Eastern Front, a situation that far surpassed its military capabilities. Therefore, it sued for peace, and reached an understanding with the Central Powers in May 1918 in the Treaty of Bucharest. Alexandru Marghiloman signed the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central Powers on May 7, 1918. However, this treaty was never signed by King Ferdinand.
The situation in Romania at the end of 1918 was dire. Romania was suffering from the consequences of the punitive war reparations imposed by the Central Powers, Dobruja was under Bulgarian occupation and a large German army under the command of field marshal August von Mackensen was retreating through the country. The bulk of the Romanian army was demobilized, leaving only four full-strength Divisions while further eight Divisions were at peace-time strength. With these troops, the army had to keep the order and protect Basarabia from hostile actions of the Soviet Union, for which purpose it used the four battle-able Divisions, while at the same time counter the Bulgarian presence in Dobrogea and supervise the retreating German forces.
On 10 November 1918, taking advantage of the Central Powers' precarious situation, Romania reentered the war on the side of the Entente with the same objectives as in 1916. King Ferdinand called for the mobilization of the Romanian Army and ordered it to attack over the Carpathian mountains into Transylvania. The end of World War I that followed very soon did not bring the end of fighting for the Romanian Army. The fighting continued later that year and into 1919 during the Hungarian–Romanian war.
Outline of the war.
The war is divided here into three phases, mirroring the main operations of the Romanian Army. In the war's first phase, the Romanian Army advanced, up to the Western Carpathian Mountains. In the second phase, after the communists took power in Hungary, the Romanian Army overcame the Hungarian Red Army to reach the Tisza river. Finally, in the third phase, the Romanian Army destroyed the Hungarian Army and occupied Budapest, ousting the communist regime of Béla Kun.
Phase I: November 1918 – March 1919.
Following the Treaty of Bucharest, the bulk of the Romanian Army was demobilized. Only the 9th and the 10th infantry divisions and the 1st and the 2nd cavalry divisions were available at war-time strength, but they were used at the time to protect Bessarabia from the attacks of the Russian Reds. The 1st, 7th and 8th Vânători divisions, stationed in Moldavia, were the first units mobilized under these circumstances. The 8th was sent to Bukovina and the other two divisions were sent to Transylvania. On November 13, 1918, the 7th division was the first Romanian Army unit to enter Transylvania at Prisăcani, in the Eastern Carpathians, followed at Palanca by the 1st.
On December 1st, 1918, the Romanian ethnics of Transylvania proclaimed the union with Romania, being supported by the Transylvanian Saxons and the Banat Swabians, but not by the Hungarian ethnics of Transylvania that wanted to be part of the newly emerging Hungarian state.
In December 1918 Romanian Army units reached the line of the Mureş river, which was the demarcation line agreed upon by the representatives of the Entente and of Hungary in Belgrade on November 13, 1918. At the same time, units of the German Army, under the command of Marshal von Mackensen, retreated westward.
Following a Romanian request, the Allied Command in the East under the leadership of the French general Franchet d'Espèrey allowed the Romanian Army to advance up to the line of the Western Carpathians. The 7th Vânători division advanced in the direction of Cluj, and the 1st in the direction of Alba-Iulia. On December 24, units of the Romanian Army entered Cluj. By January 22, 1919, the Romanian Army controlled the entire territory up to this demarcation line.
At this point the Romanian Army in Transylvania was stretched thin, having to simultaneously deter the Hungarian Army and maintain order in the territories under its control. Hence, the Romanian High Command decided to send two more divisions into Transylvania: the 2nd Vânători division to Sibiu, and the 6th infantry division to Braşov. A unified command of the Romanian Army in Transylvania was also established, with the headquarters at Sibiu; General Traian Moşoiu was put in charge of this command.
Romania started organizing the territory it had taken, which at this point was far from encompassing the ethnic Romanian population in the region. Two new infantry divisions, the 16th and the 18th, were organized from Romanian soldiers previously mobilized in the Austro-Hungarian Army.
On February 28, the Allied council decided to notify Hungary of the new demarcation line to which the Romanian Army would advance. This line coincided with the railways connecting the cities of Satu Mare, Oradea and Arad. However, the Romanian Army was not allowed to enter these cities. A demilitarized zone was to be created, stretching from there up to 5 km beyond the border marking the extent of the Romanian territorial requests on Hungary. The retreat of the Hungarian Army behind the westward border of the demilitarized zone was to begin on March 22, 1919.
The notification reached Hungary on March 19 through French Lieutenant-Colonel Fernand Vix. The Károlyi government resigned rather than accepting the notification, and on March 21 gave control to Béla Kun, who instituted a Communist regime in Hungary.
Within this period of time, only limited skirmishes took place between the Romanian and Hungarian troops, and on one occasion between Romanian and Ukrainian troops. Some Hungarian elements engaged in the harassment of the Romanian population outside the area controlled by the Romanian Army.
Phase II: April 1919 – June 1919.
After 21 March 1919, Romania faced two communist neighbors: Hungary and the Soviet Union. The Romanian delegation at the Peace Conference in Paris requested that the Romanian Army be allowed to oust the Hungarian communists from power. Although well aware of the communist danger, the Allied council was marked by dissension between the US president Woodrow Wilson, the British prime minister David Lloyd George, and the French prime minister Georges Clemenceau about the guarantees required by France for its borders with Germany. In particular, the American delegation was convinced that French hardliners around Marshal Foch were trying to initiate a new conflict that would eventually lead to a new war, this time against Germany and the Soviet Union. Acting on these premises, the participants at the conference tried to defuse the situation in Hungary. Hence, the South African General Smuts was sent to Budapest on April 4 with a proposition for the Kun government to abide by the conditions previously presented to Károlyi. This action of the Allies also amounted to recognizing Communist Hungary. In exchange for fulfilling the conditions in the Vix Note, the Allied powers would lift the blockade of Hungary and adopt a benevolent attitude towards it in the question of the territories it had to yield to Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. Kun however asked that the Romanian Army be ordered back to the line of the Mureş river, and the discussions stalled.
Meanwhile, Kun sought to gain time in order to be able to build up a military force able of waging war with Romania and Czechoslovakia. On the Romanian front, there were some 20,000 troops in the first line facing the Romanian Army. Kun managed to mobilize another 60,000 in the second line by the use of recruitment centers in Oradea, Gyula, Debrecen, and Szolnok, among others. This Hungarian Army was a mix of some elite units and officers from the former Austro-Hungarian Army, and poor-quality volunteers. They were equipped with some 137 cannons and 5 armored trains. Although a colorful mix, this army was held together by nationalist rather than communist ideals, and was therefore highly motivated. Kun hoped also that the Soviet Union would come to its help and attack Romania from the east.
Once the discussions with Kun stalled, the Romanian Army was ordered by the Romanian government to take action and force the Hungarian authorities to comply with the Allied council decision on February 28 concerning the new demarcation line. The Romanian Army in Transylvania comprised 64 infantry battalions, 28 cavalry squadrons, 160 cannons, 32 howitzers, 1 armored train, 3 air squadrons, 2 pioneer battalions, organized into two groups: North and South. The overall command of the Romanian Army in Transylvania was entrusted to General George Mărdărescu, while General Moşoiu was appointed commander of the Northern Group. The Romanian battle plan was to strike with the more powerful Northern Group and take Carei and Oradea, thus separating the elite Szekely division from the rest of the Hungarian Army, made primarily of volunteers. Then the Group should proceed with the flanking of the Hungarian Army. At the same time, the Southern Group would advance only up to Radna and Beiuş, and then serve as pivot for the flanking maneuver of the Northern Group. The overall advance was to stop only at the Tisza river. The start of the offensive was planned for April 16.
The Hungarian attack.
Aware of the Romanian preparations, the Hungarians fortified the mountain passes in their possession and launched a preemptive attack on the night between April 15 and 16. The attack was stopped with the help of the reserve formations and the Romanians defensive lines held. Between April 16 and 18, the Romanians started their own offensive, forcing the mountain passes after heavy fighting. On the front of the 2nd Vânători division, a battalion of Hungarian cadets offered heavy resistance, and was defeated by the Romanian 9th regiment only towards the evening of April 16. On April 18, the first phase of the Romanian offensive was over, and the Hungarian front was broken. Carei was taken by the Romanian troops on April 19, Oradea and Salonta on April 20. At this moment, the Romanian Army reached the line set by the Allies in the Vix Note. However, the Romanian High Command decided to go over this line and advance to the Tisza river, for military reasons: the Tisza makes a natural obstacle that is easy to defend, and at the same time the Hungarian Army was beaten but not destroyed. By doing so, the Romanians went against the wishes of the Allies.
The fate of the Székely division.
Making use of their cavalry, the Romanians hindered any attempts by the Hungarian Army to set a new defensive line between Nyíregyháza, Debrecen and Békéscsaba. At the same time on the front of the Northern Group, the best unit of the Hungarian Army, the Szekely division under the command of Colonel Kratochwil was retreating towards Nyíregyháza, being constantly harassed by the Romanian troops, mainly from the 2nd cavalry division. They tried to stop their retreat and fight around the city, but were dislodged by the Romanians, and Nyíregyháza was occupied on April 26. The Division tried to flee west over Tisza, but by this time the entire eastern bank of the river was controlled by the Romanians, the last Hungarian troops defending a bridgehead over the river being defeated on April 29 at Rakamaz. With their retreat route cut, the Székely division capitulated on April 29.
The Romanian Army reaches the Tisza line.
Debrecen was occupied by the Romanians on 23 April, and the Romanian Army started preparing for the assault on Békéscsaba. This began on 25 April and, on 26 April, the city fell after some heavy fighting. Most of the remains of the Hungarian Army converged towards Szolnok, where they tried to escape west over Tisza, establishing two concentric defense lines around Szolnok whose ends lay on the Tisza. Between 29 April and 1 May the Romanian Army managed to break through these lines, despite the reinforcements sent from the west bank of the Tisza. On the evening of 1 May 1919 the entire east bank of the Tisza was controlled by the Romanian Army.
On 2 May, the Kun government sued for peace. In the peace proposition sent through Lt. Col. Werth, Kun was ready to recognize all territorial demands of the Romanians and asked in exchange for a cessation of hostilities and no intervention in the internal Hungarian affairs. The Romanians offered only an armistice and this only under pressure from the Allied Supreme Command, as on 30 April the French foreign minister Pichon had summoned the Romanian representative at the Peace Conference, prime minister Brătianu, and asked him to stop the advance of the Romanian troops on the Tisza river and eventually retreat on the demarcation line imposed by the Allies. Brătianu promised that the Romanian troops would not cross the Tisza and would remain on the east bank of the river.
Gen. Moşoiu was named governor of the military district between the Romanian frontier and the Tisza river, being replaced at the command of the Norther Group by Gen. Mihăescu. At the same time, the Romanian 7th division was transported from the Hungarian front to the Russian front in Northern Moldavia.
The Hungarian attack on Czechoslovakia.
Béla Kun tried to make use of the lull in fighting against the Romanians to improve his battered international position. He prepared an attack against Czechoslovak forces, which he deemed the weaker of its enemies, as he had just been defeated by the Romanians, and believed that action against the Serbs was impossible due to the presence of allied French troops in Serbia. By attacking Czechoslovak troops, he tried to gain support from within Hungary, by making good on his promise to restore Hungary's borders. Kun also sought to establish a link to his Bolshevik allies in Russia. Internationally he argued that he acted on the belief that granting the territory where Hungarians were an ethnic majority to the newly formed Czechoslovakia following World War I was unjust.
Strengthening the Hungarian army.
To strengthen the army, Kun's regime recruited heavily from the male population between 19 and 25 years of age in the areas left under his control. Also many workers (mainly from the Budapest industrial area) joined the army. He also enlisted many former Austro-Hungarian officers, who joined the army out of patriotic rather than ideological reasons. For the offensive in Upper Hungary (today's Slovakia), the Hungarians concentrated two divisions, the 1st and the 5th, totaling 40 battalions with plenty of artillery.
Military operations. A Romanian perspective.
On 20 May the Hungarians, under the lead of Colonel Aurél Stromfeld, attacked in force and routed the Czechoslovak troops in Miskolc. The Romanian Command tried to hold the link to the Czechoslovak Army and attacked the Hungarian flank with some troops from the 16th infantry division and the 2nd Vânători division. However, this action was to no avail and it could not stop the rout of the Czechoslovak Army. The Romanians retreated to their bridgehead at Tokaj and defended their position against Hungarian attacks between 25 and 30 May. The Hungarian attack against the Czechoslovak Army evolved well and consequently the Romanian troops in the North were in danger of being outflanked. On the 3 of June, the Romanians were thus forced to retreat from Tokaj on the east bank of Tisza, destroying all bridges over the river in the process and breaking any contact with the Hungarian troops. To deal with the danger of being outflanked and hinder the communication between the Hungarians and the Soviets, the Romanian troops along Tisza extended their defense line further north and linked with the troops of the Romanian 8th division, which since the 22 of May had advanced from Bukovina to meet them.
Aftermath.
The success of their attack on the newly forming Czechoslovak state allowed the Hungarian Reds, besides regaining Upper Hungary, to also create a puppet Slovak Soviet Republic. At the end of the operations, the Hungarian Army had reached the old frontiers in the northeastern Carpathians. In the northwest, the campaign reoccupied important industrial regions around Miskolc, Salgótarján and Selmecbánya. They also started to plan to march against the Romanian Army in the east.
Involvement of Bolshevik Russia.
On the 9 of April 1918, Bessarabia united with Romania. The unification act that brought these old Romanian lands within the modern Romanian state was not recognized by the Bolshevik Russia, and later it was challenged by the Soviet Union as unlawful. Having to fight the Whites, the Poles, the Ukrainians and later an allied invasion in that region, the Red Army had no resources available to seriously threaten Romania at that time. The Russian hopes to use Otaman Grigoriev for an expedition against Romania were shattered after much procrastination and later refusal of the rogue general. Furthermore, numerous peasant uprisings took place near Kiev.
Before the communist takeover in Hungary, the Bolsheviks used the Odessa Soviet Republic as a buffer state to invade Romania, which only turned into several sporadic attacks over the Dniester river in order to reclaim the territory of the former Bessarabia Governorate. A somewhat similar role was taken later by the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which covered roughly the territory of the present-day Transnistria. During that period of time the Romanian Army was being reorganized and such attacks were more or less successful. However, they were always met with force by the Romanian troops stationed in Bessarabia, which managed on all occasions to throw the Bolsheviks back over the Dniester (see Iona Yakir). After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk the Soviet forces were pushed out of neighboring Ukraine eastward and until late 1918 were no longer a threat.
A Hungarian perspective.
After coming to power, the Hungarian Reds had high hopes that Soviet Union would help them by attacking Romania in Bessarabia. Indeed the Soviets applied pressure on Romania at the political level to the best of their abilities, issuing ultimatums and threatening with war. To some extent the Red Army tried also to fulfill such expectations, but what it did never amounted to a threat big enough to have a serious impact on Romanians' military operations against communist Hungary. The most notable achievement was the transfer of one Romanian division from the Hungarian front to Bessarabia. Also some newly formed Romanian formations were sent to Bessarabia to face the Soviet Red Army rather than in Transylvania to face the Hungarian Red Army.
Phase III: July 1919 – August 1919.
The Allied council was deeply displeased by the Romanian advance to the Tisza without Allied approval. There were even voices blaming the Romanians for the troubles in Hungary and asking for an immediate retreat to the original demarcation line, concomitantly with a downsize of the Romanian Army. The Council tried also to persuade the Romanians to start talks with the Kun government. However, the Romanian government stood by its decision, and argued that the Tisza line was the sole military meaningful demarcation line until the final border line between Romania and Hungary was established and internationally recognized.
The Council put pressure on Kun to stop its advances into Czechoslovakia, under the threat of a coordinated attack of the French, Serb and Romanian troops from the South and the East respectively. They also promised a favorable attitude towards Soviet Hungary in the peace talks to follow, and in delineating Hungary's new borders. On the 12th of June, these borders were brought to the attention of the governments of Romania, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Hungary. Under these circumstances, Hungary signed an armistice with Czechoslovakia on the 23rd of June and by July 4, the Hungarian troops retreated 15 km south of the demarcation line. The Council demanded that the Romanians leave Tiszántúl and retreat also to their new borders, but the Romanians replied that they would comply only after the Hungarian Army would have demobilized. Upon hearing the Romanian demands from the Council representatives, Kun answered that from now on he would rely solely on the might of his army.
This new turn of events swung the Council against Kun, and on the 11th of July it decided to start a coordinated attack of the Serb, French and Romanian troops against Soviet Hungary. The planning for this attack was entrusted to Marshal Foch. However, immediately after the Czechoslovak armistice, Hungary started to mobilize its army against the Romanians along Tisza and on the 17th of July the Hungarians were the first to strike. 
As Romania was unwilling to withdraw its army from Eastern Hungary, Kun ordered military operations against the Romanian troops.
The opposing forces.
The Romanians were facing the Hungarians on a front of some 250 km, along the Tisza, from south of Szeged, where they were neighboring with French and Serb troops, up to north of Tokaj, where they were neighboring with Czechoslovak troops.
In comparison to April 1919, the Hungarian Army facing the Romanians now along the Tisza river had greatly improved. It was better organized and equipped, and it had a high morale as it fought for its motherland. The morale was further boosted by the successes against the Czechoslovak Army. The communists held control of the army command through their political commissaries, but they were supported by experienced professional officers. At division level and below mostly professional officers were in command. The Hungarians mustered 100 infantry battalions, with some 50,000 men, 10 cavalry squadrons with 1365 men, 69 artillery batteries of calibers ranging up to 305 mm, and nine armored trains. The troops were organized for attack into three groups, North, Central and South, with the Central group being the strongest. They planned to cross the Tisza with all three groups, and then advance towards Satu Mare, Oradea and Arad respectively, expecting to ignite a communist revolt in Romania, as well and counting on some form of support from the Soviet Russia, which they hoped would launch an all-out attack into Bessarabia, on Romania's eastern border.
The Romanian Army had some 92 battalions with some 48,000 men, 58 cavalry squadrons with 12,000 men, some 80 artillery batteries of calibers ranging up to 155 mm, two armored trains, as well as some support units. They were positioned along three lines. The first line included the 16th division in the north and the 18th division in the south. In the second line more powerful formations were located, the 2nd Vânători division in the North, concentrated in and around Nyíregyháza, and the 1st Vânători division in the south, concentrated in and around Békéscsaba. The third line included the most powerful Romanian formations and had to be used as maneuvering mass; it was composed of the 1st and 6th infantry divisions, 1st and 2nd cavalry divisions, as well as some support units. These troops took positions along the railway link stretching from Carei, through Oradea, up to north of Arad. The 20th and the 21st infantry divisions were tasked with maintaining the security and public order behind the third line. The first line was rather thin, as it was supposed to fight delay actions until the true intentions of the attacking Hungarians were to be revealed. After that, together with the troops in the second line they were to hold the attackers until the counterattack of the troops in the third line could commence. For such maneuvering actions, the Romanian command planned to make use of the railway links in their control and had prepared a sufficient number of trains. The Romanians were also highly motivated, fighting for their dream to unify (into a single country) all the lands inhabited by ethnic Romanians. This long yearned dream was now supported by Woodrow Wilson's principles of self-determination and nation state. Most soldiers were experienced World War I veterans.
The Hungarian attack.
Between the 17th and the 20th of July, the Hungarians bombarded the Romanian positions and conducted reconnaissance operations. On the 20th of July, around 3:00 AM, after a violent bombardment, the Hungarian infantry of all three groups crossed the Tisza and attacked the Romanian positions.
Fighting on the flanks.
In the North, on 20 July, the Hungarians took Rakamaz and some villages around it. Troops of the Romanian 16th division took back the villages but managed to retake Rakamaz only the next day, with the help of the 2nd Vânători division. However, the Hungarians renewed their efforts and, supported by their artillery, retook Rakamaz and two villages around it, but could not break out of the bridgehead. Therefore, they tried to outflank the Romanian positions and cross the Tisza further south at Tiszafüred with troops of the 80th international brigade but they were stopped there by troops of the Romanian 16th division. The Romanians brought also some troops of the 20th infantry division into combat and managed to clear the bridgehead at Tiszafüred on 24 July. Not being able to break out of Rakamaz, the Hungarians started fortifying their positions and redeployed some troops somewhere else. There was a lull in fighting in the north, as the Romanians followed suit. Only on 26 July did the Romanians attack again and after some violent fighting that held until 10:00 PM, managed to clear the Hungarian bridgehead. After this, the Romanians were in complete control of the northern part of the Tisza's eastern bank.
In the south, the Hungarian 2nd division needed two days to take Szentes, which was being hold by the 89th and the 90th regiments of the Romanian 18th division. On 21 and 22 July, Hódmezővásárhely changed hands several times between Hungarian troops and Romanian troops of the 90th infantry regiment supported by the 1st Vânători brigade. Then on 23 July, the Romanians finally reoccupied Hódmezővásárhely, Szentes and Mindszent, thus throwing the Hungarians back over the Tisza and ending the fighting in this sector of the front. This allowed the Romanians to take the 1st Vânători brigade from the south front and use it in the center, where the Hungarian attack was progressing very well.
Fighting in the center.
On the 20th of July, the Hungarians managed to establish a solid bridgehead on the east bank of the Tisza across Szolnok, despite the opposition of the Romanian 91st regiment of the 18th infantry division. The attackers brought the entire 6th and 7th divisions within the bridgehead and overwhelmed the troops in the first line of defense. The Hungarian 6th infantry division attacked to the east and took Törökszentmiklós, while the 7th division advanced towards Mezőtúr. At the same time, the 5th division was brought over the Tisza and attacked towards Túrkeve. On the 22nd of July, the Hungarians advanced towards Kunhegyes, after crossing the Tisza some 20 km north of Szolnok and defeating the Romanian 18th Vânători regiment. The Romanian troops of the 18th division were reinforced with formations from the second line, including some troops from the 1st cavalry division, and the entire 2nd Vânători brigade. On the 23rd of July, the Hungarians manage to take Túrkeve and Mezőtúr. On the night of the 23rd of July, the Hungarians controlled an 80 km-wide, 60 km-deep chunk of the right bank of the Tiza, opposite of Szolnok. Facing them to the east and to the south were the troops of the Romanian first and second line. To the north, a Romanian maneuver group was forming with troops from the third Romanian line, including the 1st infantry division of Gen. Obogeanu in the center, the 6th infantry division under Gen. Olteanu to the left and the 2nd cavalry division of Gen. Davidoglu to the right of the group, along the Tisza.
The Romanian counterattack.
The Romanian maneuver group attacked on the morning of the 24th of July. Elements of the 2nd cavalry division, supported by troops of the 18th infantry division took Kunhegyes. The Romanian 1st infantry division attacked the Hungarian 6th infantry division head-on and pushed them back, managing to take Fegyvernek. The Romanian 6th division was less successful, being counterattacked on the left flank by the Hungarian reserve formations. In total, on the 24th of July, the Romanians managed to push the Hungarians back some 20 km and retake the initiative. They reinforced the maneuver group with troops from the North, which became available when the fighting decreased in intensity there. These included the 2nd Vânători division and some cavalry units. The Romanian troops along the entire front received the order to attack the enemy the next day. On the 25th of July the fighting continued, being particularly violent on the front of the Romanian 1st infantry division, in and around Fegyvernek, where the Hungarians chose to counterattack. Towards the end of the day, the Romanians maneuver group started breaking through the Hungarian positions in the north. Also, Hungarian positions in the south were overrun. The Hungarians started a general retreat towards the Tisza bridge in front of Szolnok, which they blew up on the 26th of July in order to stop the Romanians from following them. On the evening of 26 July, the entire east bank of the Tisza was again under firm Romanian control.
The Romanians cross the Tisza.
After repulsing the Hungarian attack, the Romanians started planning to cross the Tisza and deliver the final blow to Soviet Hungary, despite some opposition from the Allied council. They brought the 7th infantry division back from the Bessarabian front, where the Russians were holding still, and also the 2nd infantry division as well as some smaller infantry and artillery units. For crossing the Tisza the Romanian command prepared 119 battalions with some 84,000 troops, 99 artillery batteries with 392 guns and 60 cavalry squadrons with 12,000 men. The Hungarians made efficient use of their artillery, attacking the Romanian concentration areas. Between 27 and 29 July, the Romanians tested the strength of the Hungarian defense with small attacks. They finally decided to cross the Tisza in the vicinity of Fegyvernek, where the river makes a turn. On the night of 29th to 30 July, the Romanians crossed the Tisza. The main crossing at Fegyvernek was covered by decoy operations on other points of the front, where intense artillery duels took place. The Romanians managed to surprise the Hungarians at Fegyvernek who decided on the 31st of July to abandon the Tisza line and retreat towards Budapest.
The debacle of the Hungarian Army.
After the bulk of the Romanian troops crossed the Tisza, they started advancing towards Budapest. The Romanian cavalry covered the flanks of the main body of troops and tried to discover the points of concentration of the Hungarian Army. At the same time, it severed the links between the different corps of the Hungarian Army. On the 1st of August, most fighting took place in the south, in and around Szolnok, the town having been severely affected by the fighting. At the end of the day, the Hungarians sent representatives to negotiate their surrender. In the center and in the north, the Hungarian troops were completely surrounded by the evening of the 3rd of August and the units start to surrender or to disintegrate. The 3rd of August saw the end of the Hungarian Red Army.
The Romanians occupy Budapest.
The Romanians continued their push towards Budapest. The first Romanian units to enter Budapest on the evening of the 3rd of August were three squadrons of the 6th cavalry regiment of the 4th brigade, under the command of Gen. Rusescu. The 400 men with two artillery guns were the only forces to occupy the city until midday on the 4th of August, when the bulk of the Romanian forces entered Budapest and a parade took place through the center of the city in front of their commander, Gen. Moşoiu. The Romanian troops continued their advance until they stopped in Győr.
Casualties, prisoners and war booty.
The third phase of the Hungarian–Romanian War saw the most intense fighting of the entire conflict. The Romanians lost 123 officers and 6,434 soldiers: 39 officers and 1,730 soldiers dead, 81 officers and 3,125 soldiers wounded and three officers and 1,579 soldiers missing. Until the 8th of August 1919, they captured 1,235 officers and 40,000 soldiers, seized 350 guns, including two with a caliber of 305 mm, 332 machine guns, 52,000 rifles and 87 airplanes. They also seized large quantities of ammunition, and means of transportation.
Aftermath.
On the 2nd of August 1919, Béla Kun fled Hungary towards the Austrian border and eventually reached the Soviet Union. A socialist government under the leadership of Gyula Peidl was installed in Budapest with the help of some representatives of the Allies, but it was short-lived. Power was taken then by a faction trying to instate Archduke Josef as head of state and István Friedrich as prime minister. However, the Allies would not accept a Habsburg as head of state and hence a new government was needed.
The Romanians occupied all Hungary, with the exception of a piece of land around the Lake Balaton. There, a group formed around Admiral Horthy, and supplied with arms by the Romanians, was organizing the new Hungarian Army, preparing to take over after the Romanians would eventually leave. Horthy's supporters included some far-right nationalist elements, the semi-regular white guards, who were the main perpetrators of persecutions, including violence, against former bolsheviks and against the Jewish-Hungarian population, whom they perceived as communist en masse, due to the disproportionate participation of its members in the communist administration. This prompted Horthy's National Army
Initially, the Romanians also took over police and administration duties in the regions under their control. Later, under Entente pressure, they relinquished these tasks to the reorganized Hungarian administration and police, but obstructed them, for example by failing to return enough weapons to arm the police,
Reparations or looting?
The Entente was discontented with the Romanian conduct during much of its conflict with Hungary. The reason for this was that on many occasions Romania acted out of its own free will, following what it considered to be its best interest. However, in doing so it placed itself outside the framework the Entente tried to established in its agreements with Hungary. The Entente was deeply displeased with the Romanians advancing up to the Tisza river during Phase II of the conflict and even though happy to get rid of the Hungarian Bolsheviks, nor the Romanians imposing war reparations and requisitioning these on their own. The Entente thought that Hungary should pay war reparations in common with the Central Powers and pressured Romania to accept the supervision of an Inter-Allied Military Mission to superintend the disarmament of the Hungarian army and to see that the Romanian troops withdraw.
The committee of this mission included Generals Harry Hill Bandholtz for the US, who wrote a detailed diary about the events, Reginald Gorton for Great Britain, Jean César Graziani for France, and Ernesto Mombelli for Italy, whose secretary Lieutenant-Colonel Guido Romanelli was accused of being biased against the Romanians and replaced. In general, the relationship between the Romanians and at least some of the Allied representatives in Budapest was poor from the very moment the Hungarian capital fell. It was plagued by mutual distrust and lack of understanding, being even described as hostile by some modern scholars. For example, one of the first things the Mission did was to ask the Romanians, among others, not to conduct any requisitioning on their own and return what they have already taken, including also military assets that were captured from the Hungarian army on the field of battle.
The tensions between Romania and the Entente run even deeper. The Entente was no longer sympathetic towards the wishes of the Romanians to be awarded territories far beyond the line of the towns Satu Mare (Szatmárnémeti) - Oradea (Nagyvárad) - Arad (Arad) and up to the Tisza river. These were promised to Romania upon entering the war in the Treaty of Bucharest (1916), mainly for military reasons, the Tisza constituting a natural obstacle. However, the promises were irreconcilable with Wilson's policies of self-determination, because the territory between these towns and the Tisza river had an almost-homogeneous Hungarian population, and thus their fulfillment would have led to the inclusion of a very large region with a clear majority of Hungarians into Romania.
Under the leadership of prime-minister Ion Brătianu, the Romanians, besides continuing their requisitioning, also insisted on the promised Tisza border and refused to sign the peace treaty with Austria. In response, the Entente practically eliminated Romania from the set of countries receiving reparations from Germany and on 15 November the Supreme Council of the Peace Conference sent the Romanians a note asking them to stop the requisitioning return the goods already taken and leave the Hungarian territory. At the same time, it started applying more pressure for a change in the Romanian attitude, by threatening in the same note with the exclusion of Romania from the group of allied countries upon non compliance.
In the end, Bratianu had to leave, Romania received virtually no reparations (i.e., only one percent of the total) from Germany and limited amounts from Bulgaria and Turkey. However, it signed the peace treaty with Austria and was allowed to keep everything it took from Hungary, while it renounced its claims for getting all the land it was promised in 1916 and accepted a new agreement that lead directly to the borders as we know them today.
The Romanians requisitioned goods in self-imposed quotas, which they regarded as war reparations, on the basis of the armistice they've signed with the Hungarians, and, as already pointed before, without the blessing of the Entente. The Hungarians considered this to be looting, since from their point of view, the seizures were arbitrary and were only post factum secured by a peace treaty. The terms of the Romanian-imposed armistice were harsh on Hungary. In imposing such severe clauses, the Romanians followed two objectives: they tried to ensure that Hungary will be in no position to become a threat militarily at least within the near future and they sought retribution for Romania's plundering by the Central Powers during World War I. While the situation evolved, a role was played also by the fact that being denied access to what the Germans paid as war reparations towards the Entente and receiving very few from Bulgaria and Turkey, the Romanians sought compensation for their entire war effort in what they would take from Hungary. Also, in the end, by the treaties of St. Germain and Trianon, Romania had to pay a "liberation fee" of 230 millions gold francs towards Austria and Hungary respectively and had to take over a share of the public debt of Austria-Hungary corresponding to the size of the former Austria-Hungary territories it now incorporated.
When the Romanian troops finally departed Hungary at the beginning of 1920, they took extensive booty, including food, ore, means of transportation, and factory equipment. The Hungarians had to cede all war materials, excepting those weapons necessary for the troops under Horthy's command. Furthermore, they had to hand over to the Romanians their entire armament industry, 50% of the rolling stock of the Hungarian railroad (i.e., 800 locomotives and 19.000 cars), 30% of the livestock, 30% of all agricultural tools, and 35,000 wagons of cereals and fodder. Also, all the goods identified as booty taken from Romania after the Peace of Bucharest in 1918 were confiscated. Hungary had to pay as well for the expenditures of the occupation troops.
Because Romania acted outside the will of the Entente and because of the share volume of goods it requisitioned, several modern scholars and contemporary members of the Allied Committee describe this as looting. They emphasize as well the indiscriminate nature of the Romanian seizures with the example of them confiscating the telephones and typewriters from the government office in Budapest and requisitioning private automobiles. (as for example in the case of cattle, horses and even grain) either directly or by constraining the Hungarian authorities to do so. This pledged the relationships between the Hungarian population and the occupation army, which otherwise started well, the Hungarians being satisfied to get rid of the Bolshevik yoke. The requisitions of the Romanian occupation authorities also led to a large number of complaints filed by the Entente-imposed supervision body, which further afflicted the relationship between the Romanians and the Inter-Allied Military Mission.
Epilogue.
The entire Hungarian–Romanian War of 1919 was waged over a period of nine months. The Romanians lost 188 officers and 11,478 soldiers, out of which 69 officers and 3,601 soldiers died. The Romanians started retreating from Hungary in November 1919. Between February 14 and March 28, 1920 all Romanian Army units left the Hungarian territory.

Robert Karnes

Robert A. Karnes (June 19, 1917 – December 4, 1979) was a prolific television actor who also appeared in some films early in his career, including mostly uncredited parts in "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946), "Miracle on 34th Street" (1947), "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye" (1950), and "From Here to Eternity" (1953). A Kentucky native, Karnes was living in Arizona at the time he procured his Social Security number.
He was a costar with James Gregory in the NBC crime drama "The Lawless Years", having appeared as Max Fields in fifteen episodes between 1959 and 1961. The program, set during the Roaring 20s preceded the more successful "The Untouchables" by a half-season. Karnes even appeared twice on "The Untouchables". He appeared eight times on the half-hour or hour-long versions of the Alfred Hitchcock program on CBS.
Western roles.
In 1960, Karnes had a role in the western film "Five Guns to Tombstone" along with Quintin Sondergaard, who had formerly appeared on "Tombstone Territory". He was frequently cast in various television westerns, including the 1959 episode "Murder Is the Bid" of the syndicated "Mackenzie's Raiders", starring Richard Carlson. Between 1957 and 1974, he guest starred in ten episodes of CBS's "Gunsmoke" series starring James Arness. He appeared six times on Richard Boone's "Have Gun Will Travel" series, set in San Francisco, California. Between 1962 and 1971, he guest starred in five episodes of NBC's most successful western "Bonanza" with Lorne Greene. He appeared five times as the Roman Catholic Father Esteban in ABC's "The Big Valley" with Barbara Stanwyck. He starred four times in different roles on NBC's "The Virginian" with James Drury and Doug McClure.

The Criterion

The Criterion was a British literary magazine published from October 1922 to January 1939. "The Criterion" (or the "Criterion") was, for most of its run, a quarterly journal, although for a period in 1927-28 it was published monthly. It was created by the poet, dramatist, and literary critic T. S. Eliot who served as its editor for its entire run. 
Eliot's goal was to make it a literary review dedicated to the maintenance of standards and the reunification of a European intellectual community. Although in a letter to a friend in 1935 George Orwell had said "for pure snootiness it beats anything I have ever seen", writing in 1944 he referred to it as "possibly the best literary paper we have ever had". The first issue of the magazine, of which 600 copies were printed, included Eliot's "The Waste Land". In its first year, it received contributions from Luigi Pirandello, Virginia Woolf, Ezra Pound, E. M. Forster, and W. B. Yeats. Other contributors over the years included Wyndham Lewis, Ezra Pound, Herbert Read, John Middleton Murry, John Gould Fletcher, W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender, and Hart Crane. Nine contributions in 1924 and 1925 were made, pseudonymously, by Eliot's first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood, who suggested the journal's name. "The Criterion" became the first English periodical to publish Marcel Proust, Paul Valéry and Jean Cocteau.
Lady Rothermere (Mary Lilian Share, the wife of the London newspaper magnate Harold Harmsworth, Viscount Rothermere) originally financed the journal, but on reading the first issue, she wrote three letters to Eliot criticizing it, and suggested ideas for later issues, including a story by Katherine Mansfield.
After four years she withdrew her support and the magazine was acquired by Eliot's employer, Faber and Gwyer Publishing (later Faber & Faber). From January 1926, when Faber became the publisher, though January 1927 the journal was titled "The New Criterion". The issues from May 1927 though March 1928 were titled "The Monthly
Criterion".
Some of Eliot's other contributions include his short story "On the Eve", commentaries, and poems, including early versions of "The Hollow Men" and "Ash Wednesday".
Together with its rival, "Adelphi", edited by John Middleton Murry, it was the leading literary journal of the period. While the former's definitions of literature were based on romanticism allied to liberalism and a subjective approach, Eliot used his publication for expounding his defense of classicism, tradition, and Catholicism. In this contest Eliot emerged a clear victor, in the sense that in the London of the 1930s he had taken the centre of the critical stage.

The California Contractors State License Board (CSLB) was established in 1929 as the Contractors License Bureau under the Department of Professional and Vocational Standards. Today it is part of the California Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA). DCA is part of the California State and Consumer Services Agency.
The CSLB licenses and regulates contractors in 43 classifications that constitute the construction industry.
As of January 2, 2013, there were 295,065 licensed contractors in the state. The CSLB also registers Home Improvement Salespersons (HIS). As of January 2, 2013, there were 8,954 active HIS.
The top 10 licensing classifications, in order of licenses issued by CSLB on January 2, 2013, are:
A 15-member board appoints CSLB's executive officer, or registrar of contractors, and directs administrative policy for the agency's operations. This Board includes five contractors, one member of a labor organization representing building trades, one active local building official, and eight public members, one who must be from a statewide senior citizen organization. 
Appointments are made by the governor and the legislature.
The registrar oversees approximately 400 employees, who are distributed among the headquarters office in Sacramento and field offices throughout the state.
CSLB's headquarters office receives and processes applications for new licenses, additional classifications, changes of license records, and license renewals. Headquarters staff reviews and maintains records of disciplinary actions initiated by the regional offices and provides other support services. This office also provides the verified certificates of licensure used in court or other actions. The status of licensure also is made available. Headquarters directs the activities of its field offices and initiates all disciplinary actions resulting from their investigations. Field office staff investigates consumer complaints against licensed and unlicensed contractors. In fiscal year 2011-12 CSLB obtained more than $36 million in ordered restitution for consumers.
CSLB's Statewide Investigative Fraud Team (SWIFT) focuses on the underground economy and on unlicensed contractors. This unit conducts stings and sweeps to help reduce illegal contracting by citing those who are not licensed or insured for workers' compensation. SWIFT averages one undercover sting or sweep operation per week somewhere in California.
CSLB holds regularly scheduled, quarterly public meetings throughout the state. These meetings provide the public an opportunity to testify on agenda items and other issues.
CSLB's Mission Statement.
The Contractors State License Board protects consumers by regulating the construction industry through policies that promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public in matters relating to construction.

Kostner (CTA Congress Line station)

Kostner is an abandoned rapid transit station in the West Garfield Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The station served the Chicago Transit Authority's Congress Line, which is now part of the Blue Line. Kostner was opened on August 5, 1962; it was the only station on the Congress Line which was not opened with the line on June 22, 1958. The station closed on September 2, 1973, due to low ridership.
History.
When the CTA planned the Congress Line, they did not plan to put a station at Kostner. The Pulaski and Cicero stations were both close to Kostner, and the CTA felt that the lower population density of West Garfield Park did not need an additional station. It was also trying to cut down on stations in order to reduce travel times and increase efficiency. However, the Garfield Park line, which the Congress Line replaced, had a station at Kilbourn Avenue, and the Congress Line did not have a corresponding station. Neighborhood residents wanted the CTA to build a replacement station at Kostner Avenue.
In response to the neighborhood pressure, the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance requiring the CTA and the Chicago Department of Public Works to build a station at Kostner. However, the CTA did not build the station, claiming that ridership at the station would never be high and travel times on the Congress Line would increase. Residents tried to respond, saying that they would be happy with an inexpensive wooden platform and a staircase. Eventually, the residents circulated a petition for the station's construction and threatened to sue the Department of Public Works.
The CTA responded to the residents and agreed to build a station in 1961. The city agreed to build the actual station, and the CTA did track, signaling, and electrical work. The construction was complicated by the Congress Line's operation; the city built the station between the Congress Line's tracks, but the line still had to run while Kostner was being built. The CTA solved this problem by creating two temporary bypass tracks around the construction site. Congress Line trains used these tracks from November 2, 1961 to July 8, 1962.
Kostner was dedicated on August 3, 1962, at an official ceremony attended by Mayor Richard J. Daley and opened to the public two days later, on August 5. As the CTA predicted, the station never had high ridership. Station entrances peaked at 258,000 in 1967 and fell steadily after that to 137,791 in 1972, its last full year of operation. Kostner closed on September 2, 1973, as part of a group of budget-related CTA station closings; it was one of the shortest-lived CTA stations. The CTA never demolished Kostner, and the boarded-up station still sits on its original site.
Structure.
Like the other Congress Line stations, Kostner consisted of a station house on the east side of Kostner Avenue overpass and an island platform in the median of the Eisenhower Expressway. Where Kostner differed from the other stations, though, was in its size and design due to its expected low ridership and late addition to the system. The station house was typical of Congress Line stations, but it was more modest in size. It had one agent's booth, one entrance turnstile, and one exit turnstile. The station house was long and wide, less than the standard by . The platform, however, was , the standard length on the Congress Line. Kostner also did not have ramps to the platform like most Congress Line stations; instead, it had a single staircase.
Since Kostner was never intended to be part of the Congress Line, the CTA put a curve in the tracks at the station site. This curve caused the Kostner platform to be curved, which created visibility issues for conductors. To aid the conductors, a series of mirrors was installed along the station. A canopy covered the entire platform, and eight windbreaks also provided shelter. The CTA removed signage from the platform when Kostner closed, but it is otherwise intact. The station house is now boarded up and fenced off, but it is also intact.

Royal Yugoslav Navy

The Royal Yugoslav Navy (Serbo-Croatian: Кpaљeвcкa Југословенска Pатна Морнарица; "Kraljevska Jugoslovenska Ratna Mornarica"), was the navy of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.
This navy existed since the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, which was changed in 1929 to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. It was disbanded after the Axis invasion in April 1941.
History.
Origins.
Yugoslavia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, destroyed by the First World War. The new state, officially the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, prior to which date there had been a degree of chaos in the region, following the Armistice, when numerous "sailor's councils" and splinter factions had taken over many of the former Austro-Hungarian warships. Yugoslavia made demands for a large proportion of the former Empire's fleet.
However, the Italians were extremely uneasy about the rise of a new naval power in the Adriatic area and pressed the Allies to distribute the Austro-Hungarian fleet among the victors. This was done, and only scraps of the former navy were allocated to Yugoslavia. The ships received were 12 modern torpedo-boats, four obsolete minesweepers, four armoured river monitors and a number of auxiliaries. The fleet was further strengthened during the 1920s, when six minesweepers of the German "M" class and the old cruiser SMS "Niobe" were bought.
Before the April 1941 invasion.
On the eve of the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, the Royal Yugoslav Navy was equipped with one elderly ex-German light cruiser (suitable only for training purposes), one large modern destroyer flotilla leader of British design, three modern destroyers of French design (two built in Yugoslavia plus another still under construction), one seaplane tender, four modern submarines (two older French-built and two British-built) and 10 modern motor torpedo boats (MTBs). Of the older vessels, there were six ex-Austrian Navy medium torpedo boats, six ex-German Navy minesweepers, five small minelayers, four large armoured river monitors and various auxiliary craft.
Naval Operations during the Invasion of Yugoslavia.
When Germany and Italy attacked Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, The Royal Yugoslavian Navy had available three destroyers, two submarines and 10 MTBs as the most effective units of the fleet. One other destroyer, the "Ljubljana", was in dry-dock at the time of the invasion and she and her anti-aircraft guns were used in defence of the fleet base at Kotor. The remainder of the fleet was useful only for coastal defence and local escort and patrol work.
Kotor was close to the Albanian border and the Italo-Greek front there, but Zara (Zadar), an Italian enclave, was to the north-west of the coast and to prevent a bridgehead being established, the destroyer "Beograd", four of the old torpedo boats and six MTBs were despatched to Šibenik, 80 km to the south of Zara, in preparation for an attack. The attack was to be coordinated with the 12th "Jadranska" Infantry Division and two "Odred" (combined regiments) of the Royal Yugoslav Army attacking from the Benkovac area, supported by air attacks by the 81st Bomber Group of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force. The Yugoslav forces launched their attack on 9 April, but by 13 April the Italian forces had counter-attacked and were in Benkovac by 14 April. The naval prong to this attack faltered when the destroyer "Beograd" was damaged by near misses from Italian aircraft off Šibenik when her starboard engine was put out of action, after which she limped to Kotor, escorted by the remainder of the force, for repairs.
The maritime patrol float-planes of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force flew reconnaissance and attack missions during the campaign, as well as providing air cover for mine-laying operations off Zara (Zadar). Some of their successes included an Italian tanker being damaged by a near miss off the Italian coast near Bari, attacks on the Albanian port of Durrës, as well as strikes against Italian re-supply convoys to Albania. On 9 April, one Dornier Do 22K floatplane notably took on an Italian convoy of 12 steamers with an escort of eight destroyers crossing the Adriatic during the day, attacking single-handed in the face of intense AA fire.
The Royal Yugoslav Navy also had at its disposal four large, heavily armed and armoured river monitors in its riverine flotilla. They were used to patrol the Danube, Drava and Sava rivers in the northern parts of Yugoslavia and its border with Hungary.
These monitors, the , , and had been inherited from the Austro-Hungarian Navy at the end of the First World War. All were of around 400-500t with a main armament of two 120mm guns, two or three 66mm guns, 120mm mortars, 40mm AA guns and machine guns.
At the start of the campaign they had carried out offensive operations by shelling the airfield at Mohács in Hungary on the 6th of April and again two days later, but had to begin withdrawing towards Novi Sad by the 11th of April after coming under repeated attack by German dive-bombers.
Early in the morning of 12 April, a squadron of German Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombers attacked the Yugoslav monitors on the Danube. The "Drava" was hit by several of them but they were unable to penetrate the "Drava"'s 300mm thick deck armour, until, by chance, one put a bomb straight down the funnel, killing 54 of the 67 man crew. During the attack anti-aircraft gunners on the monitors claimed three dive-bombers shot down.
The remaining three monitors were scuttled by their crews later on 12 April as German and Hungarian forces had occupied the bases and the river systems upon which they operated.
Losses.
The Italians captured most of the Yugoslav Navy (one of its four destroyers, the "Ljubljana", had spent the campaign in dry-dock). However, another destroyer, the "Zagreb", was blown up at Kotor by its officers Mašera and Spasić to prevent capture and one of the British-built submarines and two MTBs succeeded in escaping to Alexandria in Egypt to continue to serve with the Allied cause. It should also be noted that a fourth destroyer was captured while under construction in the Cattaro shipyard, the "Split", but the Regia Marina was not able to finish her before the armistice in 1943. Eventually, she was recovered after the war by the Yugoslavians and completed under the original name.
Ten Yugoslav Navy maritime patrol float-planes escaped to Greece, with nine making it to Egypt, where they formed a squadron under RAF command.
A number of the surviving Yugoslav warships, notably the destroyers "Dubrovnik", "Beograd" and the repaired "Ljubljana", were used by the Regia Marina until the Italian Armistice of September 1943, whereupon the Kriegsmarine and, to a lesser extent, the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia Croatian Forces appropriated the survivors for their own fleets. The destroyer "Ljubljana" was wrecked on a shoal near the Gulf of Tunis whilst in Italian service in April 1943, but the "Dubrovnik" and "Beograd" were not sunk by Allied forces until April and May 1945 respectively. The light cruiser "Dalmacija" entered German service with the old name "Niobe". Beached on Silba it was destroyed by British MTB 276 and MTB 298 in December 1943. Several ships which survived the war continued their service with the Navy of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia.

Willits High School

Willits High School is a high school located in Willits, California. Willits High School began in September, 1904, and met on the second floor of the Maize Mercantile Building on the corner of Main and Commercial Streets. Three years later, a new high school was built at Pine and Maple Streets. Willits High School held classes there until the school burned in November, 1928. In 1929, a new high school was built on the present location (299 North Main St. Willits, CA). It was remodeled in 1958, and again in 1988. In 1990, Willits High School was recognized as a Distinguished School by the California Department of Education. From a graduating class of four in 1904 to 123 in 2008, Willits High School continues to stand for quality education. The school mascot is a wolverine.
Academics.
Willits High School's academic objective is to transform every student into an active learner. Sam Heath—famous for his 2011 campaign to nickname the town of Willits "The Quadrangle of Knowledge"—was the class of 2010 salutatorian.
Athletics.
Willits High School has teams in 14 sports: Swimming, Diving, Track, Basketball, Cross Country, Baseball, Football, Golf, Soccer, Softball, Cheerleading, Tennis, Volleyball, and Wrestling. These teams compete in the North Coast Section CIF (NCS) and Coastal Mountain Conference (CMC). Willits High School's rival team is the Fort Bragg Timberwolves. During football season, many alumni and people from the community attend games and cheer along with students.
Willits High School also has several clubs: Peer Counseling, California Scholarship Federation, Future Farmers of America, Environmental Club, Interact Club, Peer Health Education, Las Razas Unidas, Associated Student Body, Leadership, GSA/Safe Haven, Odyssey of the Mind, Poetry Team, WHS Boosters Club, Drama Club, and Youth for Christ.
Student life.
With Spirit Weeks occurring every season to unite the student body, students have plenty of activities to do. There are also programs outside of the school itself that make student life more rounded and keep students in touch with each other in healthy ways. The organization, Challenge day [http://www.challengeday.org/] comes to the school once a year and holds their day long program, usually for incoming freshman. The goal of the program is to promote connection and understanding between students based on compassion, and embracing diversity.
There are also many dances throughout the school year, but the ones held almost every year are: the Back to School dance (held outdoors in the quad), Homecoming dance, Winter ball (usually in January or February), and Prom. 
School Song:
Hail to Green and Gold,
Our colors lifted up to the sky,
We will never fail
To keep our banners waving on high.
Glory to our team,
Our fighting spirits ever prevail.
We will fight for Willits High,
And march on to gain our victory tonight!

The Equation of Love and Death

The Equation of Love and Death () is a 2008 Chinese dramatic film written and directed by Cao Baoping and starring Zhou Xun. The film is a Chinese (Huayi Brothers) and Hong Kong (Sundream Motion Pictures) co-production. It is Cao's second solo feature after 2006's "Trouble Makers".
"The Equation of Love and Death" premiered in China on September 18, 2008 in Shanghai and had its North American premiere at the 2008 Vancouver International Film Festival where it was part of the Dragons and Tigers side competition.
"The Equation of Love and Death" tells the story of Li Mi (played by Zhou Xun), a Kunming cab driver who longs for the day she can be reunited with her missing boyfriend. After a case of mistaken identity, a kidnapping, and a threat of extortion, Li Mi's dream may be on the cusp of becoming a reality.
Reception.
Early reviews by western critics suggested that Cao Baoping's sophomore film was a stylish thriller/drama, but that much depended on the power of Zhou Xun's performance as Li Mi. Shelly Kraicer, the Chinese film scholar and curator of the Vancouver International Film Festival's Dragons and Tigers competition noted that while director "Cao Baoping is an expert at orchestrating frenzy," the film ultimately belonged to Zhou Xun. Despite the praise, the film would not go on to win the award (which went to Emily Tang's "Perfect Life"). "Variety" critic Derek Elley also wrote in his review that the film was "motored by another saturated by the throaty-voiced Zhou."
Other critics saw the film as yet another example of China's growing sophistication with "genre films." The "China Film Journal" in its final verdict argued that while the film was not "life-changing," it was nevertheless a "step in the right direction" and that audiences would not mind "seeing a few more "Memento"-esque films" coming out of China in the near future.
The film won the Altadis New Directors Award at the 2008 San Sebastian International Film Festival.

Glass crusher

A glass crusher provides for pulverization of glass to a yield size of 2" or less.
Recycling operations may range from simple, manually-fed, self-contained machines to extravagant crushing systems complete with screens, conveyors, crushers and separators. All non-glass contaminants must generally be removed from the glass prior to recycling. The processes used in glass crushing for recycling involves the same methods used by the aggregate industry for crushing rock into sand (rock crusher).
Vertical shaft impactor (VSI) glass crushing.
The use of VSI crushers in large scale operations allow the production of up to 125 tons per hour of crushed glass cullet.
VSI Crushers use a high speed rotor with wear-resistant tips and a crushing chamber designed to 'throw' the glass against. The VSI crushers utilize velocity rather than surface force as the predominant force to break glass as this allows the breaking force to be applied evenly both across the surface of the material as well as through the mass of the material. In its shattered state, glass has a jagged and uneven surface. Applying surface force (pressure) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubicle particles. As glass is 'thrown' by a VSI rotor against a solid anvil, it fractures and breaks along fissures. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the velocity at which the glass is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI crushing is generally of a consistent cubicle shape which may optimize yield in consumptive applications such as the fabrication of fiberglass, ceramic ware, flux agents and abrasives. Due to the highly abrasive nature of the glass material, a VSI crushing process is generally preferred over Horizontal Shaft Impact and most other crushing methods with higher maintenance and lower wear part lives.
VSI crushers generally utilize a high speed spinning rotor at the center of the crushing chamber and an outer impact surface of either abrasive resistant metal anvils or crushed glass (or rock in an aggregate applications). Utilizing cast metal surfaces 'anvils' are traditionally referred to as a "Shoe and Anvil VSI". Utilizing crushed material on the outer walls of the crusher for new material to be crushed against is traditionally referred to as "rock on rock VSI".

Jean-Nicolas Huyot

Jean-Nicholas Huyot (December 25, 1780, Paris – August 2, 1840, Paris) was a French architect, best known for his 1823 continuation of work on the Arc de Triomphe from the plans of Jean Chalgrin.
Son of a builder, Huyot attended the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and won the Prix de Rome in 1807.
Following his study in Rome, between 1817 and 1821 Huyot traveled in Asia Minor, Egypt, and Greece.
He developed significant credentials as an antiquarian. He was part of the "Cléopâtra" expedition under Louis Nicolas Philippe Auguste de Forbin in 1817, and Huyot sent to Jean-François Champollion a collection of inscriptions he'd found in the temple of Ramses II at Abu Simbel; this contribution was helpful in Champollion's work in deciphering hieroglyphics. Huyot also provided technical archeological assistance to the Fine Arts section of the French scientific Morea expedition into Greece in 1823.
In 1822 Huyot was elected a member of the Academy of Fine Arts of the Institut de France. Among his architectural students were Hector Lefuel, Alexis Paccard, Jean-Louis Victor Grisart, Jean-Charles Danjoy and the Swiss architect Melchior Berri.
Beginning in 1823 Huyot began presenting lectures in classical architectural history at the École des Beaux-Arts, lectures that influenced a group of self-stylized "romantic" architectural students including Félix Duban, Henri Labrouste, Léon Vaudoyer and Louis Duc. This group in turn was influential in establishing neo-Classicism as a style in mid-19th Century France.
At his death he bequeathed to the National Library a large collection of drawings and plans. He was buried in the cemetery of Pere-Lachaise (8th division).

Walter Whittaker

Walter Whittaker (20 September 1878 – 2 June 1917) was an English footballer. His regular position was as a goalkeeper. Born in Manchester, he played for several clubs, including Newton Heath, Grimsby Town, Reading, Blackburn Rovers, Derby County, Clapton Orient, Exeter City and Swansea Town.
Whittaker began his career with Manchester League side Molyneaux. He had a short spell with Buxton, but returned to Molyneaux before joining Newton Heath in February 1896 as a replacement for William Douglas, who had transferred to Derby County. Whittaker was one of four goalkeepers Newton Heath tried following Douglas' departure (including their regular left-half Walter Cartwright), but the team lost all three matches Whittaker appeared in; he was transferred to Fairfield at the end of the season.
After a season away, Whittaker returned to The Football League with Second Division side Grimsby Town in May 1897, playing in all but two of the club's matches in the 1897–98 season. In May 1898, Whittaker transferred to Southern League club Reading, where he played for almost two seasons before returning to The Football League with Blackburn Rovers in February 1900. After just over 50 league appearances for Blackburn, Whittaker rejoined Grimsby Town – newly promoted to the First Division – in December 1901. The club narrowly avoided relegation at the end of the 1901–02 season, but they were unable to repeat the feat in 1902–03, and at the end of the season, after 47 more appearances for Grimsby, Whittaker transferred to Derby County to remain a First Division player.
Whittaker was predominantly Derby's second-choice goalkeeper in 1903–04, making just 12 league appearances out of a potential 34, before returning to the Southern League with Brentford in May 1904. After two years with Brentford, he moved back to Reading for a season, before returning to the Football League again in 1907 with Second Division side Clapton Orient. After making 90 Football League and six FA Cup appearances in three years with the London side, he made a final return to the Southern League First Division with Exeter City in July 1910.
In July 1912, Whittaker was appointed as the first manager of Swansea Town (now Swansea City) and spent two years with the newly elected Southern League Second Division club in a player-manager capacity. In his first season with Swansea, he won the Welsh Cup and guided the team to third place in the league. After leaving Swansea, he took over as player-manager at nearby Llanelly, but his time there was cut short by the start of the First World War.
He died of pneumonia in 1917 at the age of 48.

American Creosote Works (Pensacola Plant)

The American Creosote Works Superfund site is an inactive wood-treating facility in Pensacola, Florida located about a quarter-mile north of the confluence of Bayou Chico and Pensacola Bay. The Superfund program of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) protects the public and the environment by requiring cleanup of the nation’s worst hazardous waste sites.
History.
The plant operated from 1902 until 1981, when the company filed for bankruptcy. Before 1950, creosote was the primary wood preservative chemical, and after 1950 pentachlorophenol (PCP) became the preferred chemical. Prior to 1970, operators discharged liquid process wastes into two onsite, unlined, percolation ponds which were allowed to overflow into Bayou Chico and Pensacola Bay. Later, workers drew wastewaters off the ponds periodically and discharged them into designated "spillage areas" on site. Additional discharges occurred when heavy rainfall flooded the ponds, which then overflowed their dikes.
Contamination concerns.
The site is in a predominantly residential area, with commercial properties along the northern boundary. Though the area is served by municipal water supplies, numerous residents and businesses operate private irrigation wells. Major contaminants in the soil, sediment, and groundwater are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), PCP, and dioxins and dioxin-like compounds from the former wood-treating processes.

Ramon Curtis Cortines (born July 22, 1932) is a retired American educator who was the Superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District in Los Angeles, California from January 1, 2009 to April 16, 2011.
Cortines was born in San Antonio, Texas. Cortines had also served in the U.S. Army from 1953-1955.
Cortines is a former Superintendent of Schools in the California cities of San Francisco, San Jose and Pasadena, along with being a former New York City Schools Chancellor. He was appointed to lead the New York City Schools in September 1993 by the former New York City Board of Education, serving during the last months of the administration of Mayor David Dinkins and during the first years of the administration of Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Cortines and Giuliani feuded for much of their shared tenure, with Giuliani being critical of Cortines' running of the schools. Cortines stepped down from the chancellorship in October 1995, going into the private sector.
Following his tenure in New York, Cortines served as a Senior Advisor to the U.S. Secretary of Education during the tenure of former Education Secretary Richard Riley. Before accepting the chancellorship, Cortines had been nominated to serve as Assistant Secretary of Education for Intergovernmental Affairs by President Bill Clinton, but he withdrew his nomination before his was confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Cortines served as LA's interim Superintendent for several months in 2000, before former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer assumed the position.
From 2006 to 2008, Cortines served as LA's Deputy Mayor for Education, Youth and Families in the Cabinet of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. As deputy mayor, Cortines oversaw education policy for the mayor, was his liaison to the school district, along with overseeing various agencies and policies impact children and families, including parks and recreation. Cortines left this position to become Senior Deputy Superintendent of Schools. Cortines has also worked, if not continues to work, as a consultant for Eli Broad Foundation, the William & Flora Hewlett Foundation, the James Irvine Foundation, and the Institute for Learning at the University of Pittsburgh.
In May 2013, according to an official statement from the Los Angeles Unified School District, former Superintendent Ramon Cortines admits to what he calls "consensual spontaneous adult behavior," but denies sexual harassment claims in a case that the district settled for $200,000 plus additional benefits. Source: LA Daily News - LAUSD will pay $200,000 settlement over alleged sexual harassment by former Superintendent Ramon Cortines
Tenure at Los Angeles Unified.
While at LAUSD, Superintendent Ramon C. Cortines had dual jobs as a board member from the Scholastic board and as Superintendent of LAUSD. LA Times reported that he was paid $150,000 while serving at the Scholastic board in addition to $250,000 as Superintendent of LAUSD. Cortines defended his tenure at Scholastic and claimed he avoided any issue that involved the educational publishing company. Cortines resigned from the Scholastic board on February, 18, 2010.
A notable controversy occurred six months after Cortines was named Superintendent of LAUSD, after he proposed to reduce funding for the Office of Inspector General (OIG) by 75%. During this time, LAUSD was operating under a significant budget shortfall. The Inspector General of OIG, Jerry Thornton, a retired FBI agent, came to a compromise with Cortines to reduce OIG's budget by 25% instead. Subsequently, Cortines and the LAUSD Board members refused to extend Thornton’s contract. Thornton had previously produced audit and investigative reports that showed misuse of funds, lack of financial controls and many conflict-of-interest charges against senior district management. Notable reports include excessive consultant costs at the district's construction program, over $20 billion, largest in the country, as well as millions in excessive and unwarranted consultant charges against the Office of Environmental Health and Safety. Cortines eventually suspended and replaced many of the senior staff mentioned in Thornton’s audits. Thorton left on June 30, 2010. Cortines selected, and the Board approved, Jess Womack, former deputy general counsel for the LAUSD construction program, as interim Inspector General. Interim Jess Womack continued OIG investigations of LAUSD senior management. A notable report was released four months after Jerry Thornton’s departure, which found “irregularities in $65 million worth of consultant contracts.” This includes costs that exceeded pre-approved amounts by 50% and additional contracts worth $31 million without school board approval, specifically against James Sohn, Chief of Facilities, whom Cortines had hired to replace the prior chief, Guy Mehula. Cortines responded to this by canceling $3.7 million in consulting contracts cited in the report, but left open the possibility these consultants and contracts would return.
Ramon Cortines retired from the Los Angeles Unified School District on April 16, 2011.
"Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution".
Television personality, British chef and health campaigner Jamie Oliver came to Los Angeles in order to start a food revolution by studying school lunches and introducing healthy and tasty food alternatives. Cortines denied Oliver permission to film in LAUSD schools. Oliver found a loophole by filming in West Adams Preparatory High School, a partnership school run by MLA Partner Schools, with orders he would not be allowed in the kitchen. Oliver then moved to Manual Arts Senior High, another MLA Partner School, but was denied a permit by Cortines unless he could guarantee that LAUSD would be portrayed in a positive light.
In an April 2011 interview with the Associated Press, Oliver contrasted Cortines's opposition with the support he had enjoyed from public officials during the show's original seasons in the UK, going all the way up to the Prime Minister: "I'm disappointed that as public servants, they feel they have the right to not be transparent." In an appearance on "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart", he suggested "there’s elements of backhandedness or certain things that shouldn’t be going on as far as procurement is concerned," possibly referencing cash rebates paid to the district by manufacturers of frozen, processed, and packaged foods. Cortines stated his concern that "such reality TV programs can be disruptive to students."

Effects of Hurricane Georges in Haiti

The effects of Hurricane Georges in Haiti included $200 million in damages and at least 400 fatalities.
Background.
Hurricane Georges began as a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa during mid-September 1998. Tracking westward, the wave spawned an area of low pressure two days later, which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. On September 16, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges, and to Hurricane Georges the next day. The storm reached its peak intensity on September 20 with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), just below Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.
Over the following five days, the hurricane tracked through the Greater Antilles, causing over 600 fatalities, mainly in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. By September 25, Georges entered the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane. The storm made landfall three days later near Biloxi, Mississippi with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). Upon landfall, the hurricane's forward motion slowed to an eastward drift. Georges dissipated on October 1 near the Atlantic coast of Florida.
Impact.
Upon reaching Haiti, Georges was a weakened hurricane, but it still brought heavy rainfall across the entire country. The capital city of Port-au-Prince was largely unharmed, with the exception of flooding in low-lying coastal areas, damaging the main commercial port. The rest of the country, however, experienced a significant number of mudslides due to deforestation along the mountains. These mudslides destroyed or severely damaged many houses, leaving 167,332 homeless. Damage was greatest along the northern coastline from Cap-Haïtien to Gonaïves due to the flooding and mudslides. On the southern coast, the head of a U.S.-based medical team, stranded for several days by flooding in the remote town of Belle Anse, anticipated a rise in malnutrition, disease, homelessness and poverty. Lack of electricity led to a total disruption of Haiti's water supply system, causing a decrease in sanitary conditions across the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. In all, at least 400 people died in Haiti.
Like in the Dominican Republic, the agricultural sector suffered extreme damage. After a severe drought in 1997, Georges's severe flooding stopped any chances of recovering quickly. Most of the country's significant crop land, including Artibonite Valley, suffered total losses. Up to 80% of banana plantations were lost, while vegetable, roots, tubers, and other food crops were ruined. In addition, thousands of small farm animals were either killed or lost. Total agricultural losses amounted to $179 million (1998 USD, $250 million 2009 USD).
Aftermath.
The country requested food assistance in the aftermath of the hurricane to alleviate the serious losses.

Ong-Bak 3 () is a 2010 Thai martial arts film directed, produced and written by Tony Jaa and Panna Rittikrai. The film's story is a follow-up to "Ong Bak 2", where Tien (Tony Jaa) is brutally beaten before being put to death by Lord Rajasena (Sarunyu Wongkrajang)'s men. His body is recovered by his Master Bua (Nirut Sirijanya) who revives him. When Tien returns to his village, he finds it taken over by Bhuti Sangkha (Dan Chupong).
Plot.
In the year 1431 in Thailand, Tien /(Tony Jaa) is held captive being beaten with wooden staves. On the orders of Lord Rajasena (Sarunyu Wongkrajang), his elbows and knees are snapped. As Lord Rajasena sleeps, Tien's guerilla fighters attempt to free Tien, but Bhuti Sangkha (Dan Chupong) appears and kills them. Lord Rajasena offers to hire Bhuti, but he refuses and gives the offer to remove the curse which has been placed on Rajasena before leaving. Rajasena orders his men to kill Tien, but before this can be carried out, a man arrives with a pardon from the king, indicating that he will take Tien's corpse, much to Rajasena's ire. The messenger returns Tien's body to the Kana Khone villagers. After fending off the village from invaders who are after Tien's body, Master Bua (Nirut Sirijanya) feels guilty over Tien's imprisonment and becomes a Buddhist monk. Pim (Primrata Det-Udom) revives Tien to life, but finds that Tien is still crippled from his beatings. Tien then embarks on a rehabilitation regimen with the help of Master Bua.
Rajasena visits Bhuti at his temple to remove his curse, but Bhuti reveals his true motive of usurping Rajasena and becoming the new king. After a battle, Bhuti decapitates Rajasena, but his severed head curses Bhuti. After meditating, Tien returns to his village to find it in ruins, and the surviving villagers kidnapped and enslaved by Bhuti. Bhuti uses his magic to summon an eclipse. When Pim reveals herself as Tien's companion, she is taken to Bhuti's palace, where she is killed. Tien witnesses this killing from a statue and fights his way through the guards before confronting Bhuti, who launches a spear at Tien's chest. As he falls to his knees, defeated, he remembers Bua's words, and finds himself again atop the statue. Overcoming Bhuti's illusion, lightning strikes and Bhuti's eclipse magic is dispelled. Bhuti attempts to escape but is confronted by Tien. Bhuti attempts again to throw a spear at Tien, who catches and throws it aside. On the royal ledge above the arena, Tien's upright finger tips hold Bhuti aloft by his chin. Suddenly an elephant's trunk butts the doors below the ledge, causing Bhuti to fall from Tien's grasp. Bhuti falls, over the elephant's tusks. The camera pans as we watch Bhuti dying on the ground, pierced by the elephant's broken tusk. As he breaths his last breath, the elephant, now resembling the one tusk Ganesha, raises his head in a victorious trumpet. Beginning life anew, with good having triumphed over evil, the final scene opens as Tien, Pim and the remaining villagers, pray before the statue of Ong Bak.
Production.
After the first two weeks of "Ong Bak 2" theatrical release, the president of Sahamongkol Film announced their intention of a sequel. Filming of new footage for the follow-up was to begin before the end of the year and was to incorporate unused footage from "Ong Bak 2".
Release.
"Ong Bak 3" was released in Thailand on May 5, 2010. On its first week it played in 135 theaters in Thailand and was the second highest grossing film in the Thai box office, earning $555,823. "Ong Bak 3" earned $1,335,646 during its theatrical run in Thailand and grossed a total of $2,325,473 with foreign markets. 
This was less successful than "Ong Bak 2", which had made $8,936,663 in total. "Ong Bak 3" had its North American premiere at Fantastic Fest on September 23, 2010.
The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in Australia on November 8, 2010, and in the United States on February 8, 2011.
Reception.
The film has received generally negative reviews. Both "Empire" and Film Business Asia praised the action scenes but pointed out the weak story. Film Business Asia gave the film a five out of ten rating praising the action sequences but finding that it made "Ong Bak 2" "look like a masterpiece of character development." "Variety" and "Total Film" found the film spent too much focus on Buddhist philosophy that left not enough time for the action scenes. "Total Film" awarded the film two stars out of five, stating that "a greater focus on Buddhist philosophy...leaves little room for the sort of bone-crunching, no-frills set-pieces that first brought Jaa to our attention." Slant Magazine gave the film three stars out of four praising it as "easily the most brutal of all the contemporary Thai martial arts films that have come to the U.S. thus far. But that's what characterizes the Thai style of fighting films: inspired excess and decadence."
Video game.
"Ong Bak Tri" is being developed by Studio Hive and will be published worldwide by Immanitas Entertainment for PC, smartphones, PlayStation Network, and Xbox Live Marketplace. It will be a 2.5D side-scrolling brawler with "intense fighting action, impressive free-running sequences, and highly cinematic quick-time action events," according to the press release. The game, like the second and third films, is set in ancient Thailand. No official release date has been announced.

Digiglyph

A digiglyph is the final stage of a printmaking process that combines traditional monoprinting techniques with digital manipulation and out sourcing. A digiglyph differs from a traditional monoprint or monotype in that it uses a completed hand-drawn monoprint/monotype as the first stage of a final piece. The monoprint is scanned, and then its composition is further manipulated using computer software, before being reprinted and hand embellished. Digital digiglyph files can be used to produce editions; however, hand embellishment of each print transforms the digiglyph into a one of a kind image.
Technique.
Starting out as a traditional monoprint, the digiglyph departs from hand work by using computer software to scan the completed print and layer in conceptually related material. The completed digital composition is exported and the finished digital print is then embellished by hand creating a unique print.

Christmas in the American Civil War

Christmas in the American Civil War (1861–1865) was celebrated in both the United States and the Confederate States of America although the day did not become an official holiday until five years after the war ended. The war continued to rage on Christmas and skirmishes occurred throughout the countryside. Celebrations for both troops and civilians saw significant alteration. Propagandists, such as Thomas Nast, used wartime Christmases to reflect their beliefs. In 1870, Christmas became an official Federal holiday when President Ulysses S. Grant made it so in an attempt to unite north and south.
War activities.
On the first Christmas Day during the war, Lincoln hosted a Christmas party during the evening; earlier that day, he spent many hours trying to legitimize the capture of Confederate representatives to Great Britain and France, John Slidell and James Murray Mason (the Trent Affair).
In 1862, the Lincolns visited injured soldiers at the various hospitals. Many Union soldiers in 1863 received gifts "From Tad Lincoln", as Tad had been deeply moved by the plight of Union soldiers when he was taken by his father to see them. The gifts were mostly books and clothing. The most famous Christmas gift Lincoln ever received came on December 22 when William Tecumseh Sherman announced the capture of Savannah, Georgia.
Military exercises also took place on December 25. In 1861, a blockade runner was caught by the Union navy, and there were two skirmishes in Virginia and Maryland. In 1862, there were several skirmishes, and Confederate general John Hunt Morgan engaged in his famous Christmas Raid in Kentucky; on that single day, Morgan's men destroyed everything he possibly could of the improvements that the Louisville & Nashville Railroad had made along 35 miles of track from Bacon Creek to Lebanon Junction. There was also a military execution for desertion that the soldiers were forced to witness. In 1863, Union forces destroyed Confederate salt works at Bear Inlet, North Carolina; there were also several skirmishes between Confederate artillery and the Union navy on the Stono River and near Charleston in South Carolina. In 1864, the Confederates fiercely repelled the Federal assault of sixty warships on Fort Fisher, while in the western theater of the war there were several skirmishes fought.
Celebrating.
Soldiers not actively campaigning celebrated Christmas in several ways. Union soldiers would use salt pork and hardtack to decorate Christmas trees. Others were treated to special meals; a captain from Massachusetts treated his soldiers to foods such as turkey, oysters, pies, and apples. However, many soldiers received no special treats or privileges. In one incident on December 25, 1864, 90 Union soldiers from Michigan, led by their captain, dispensed "food and supplies" to poor Georgians, with the mules pulling the carts decorated to resemble reindeer by having tree branches tied to their heads. In some units, celebrating Christmas was not allowed. On December 25, 1862, soldiers of one unit were punished for celebratory gunfire for the holiday, when actually the gunfire was for a funeral salute.
Carols, hymns, and seasonal songs were sung during the period, with some, such as "Deck the Halls", "Oh Come All Ye Faithful", and Mendelssohn's "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing" (1840), still sung today. American musical contributions to the season include "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear" (1850), "Jingle Bells" (1857), "We Three Kings of Orient Are" (1857) and "Up on the Housetop" (1860). Although popular in Europe at the time, Christmas cards were scarce in the United States, and would not enjoy widespread use until the 1870s.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote his pacifist poem, "Christmas Bells" on Christmas Day 1864 at the news of his son Lieutenant Charles Appleton Longfellow having suffered severe wounds in November during the Mine Run Campaign. The poem was set to the tune "Waltham" by John Baptiste Calkin sometime after 1872 and has since been received into the established library of Christmas carols. The carol does not include two stanzas from the original poem that focused on the war.
For children, Christmas was altered during the war. Presents were fewer, especially in the devastated South. In "We Were Marching on Christmas Day", author Kevin Rawlings notes that some southern children worried about the Union blockade, and one little girl, Sallie Brock Putnam, plotted the course Santa Claus would have to take to avoid it. Sometimes fathers on both sides were allowed furlough, and children were said to react to their fathers as if seeing "near strangers". Excuses for a lack of Santa included Yankees having shot him.
Nast cartoons and other propaganda.
Thomas Nast, who used his editorial cartoons to issue Union propaganda, made several illustrations reflecting the war.
The one for Christmas Eve 1862, which ran in the January 1863 issue of Harper's Weekly shows a wife on one side praying though a window in one circle, and in another circle shows her husband on the battlefield, also in prayer. The same issue's cover started how Santa Claus would be perceived by future Americans, as a white-bearded Santa hands such gifts as socks to Union soldiers, while also holding a Jefferson Davis dancing puppet with a rope tied around its neck to perfectly insinuate a lynching. The Christmas 1863 issue showed the couple back together.
The Nast Christmas cartoon for 1864 was more conciliatory print, showing Lincoln inviting Confederate soldiers into a warm lodge hall full of merriment. Lincoln called Nast's use of Santa Claus "the best recruiting sergeant the North ever had".
Nast was not the only one to use Christmas as a propaganda tool. On the Union side, "The New York Herald" also engaged in propaganda. One illustration published in the paper included Santa Claus fuming that he could not reach southern children, due to the northern blockade. On the Confederate side, "The Richmond Examiner" described Santa to its young readers as "a Dutch toy monger" who was a New York/New England "scrub" and Hottentot that had nothing to do with traditional Virginian celebrations of Christmas.
Even through the war was over, Nast had a drawing in the Christmas 1865 issue of Harper's Weekly depicting the heads of several Confederate generals at Ulysses S. Grant's feet in an image that centered around Santa. After the war Nast purposely made the North Pole the home of Saint Nick so that no one else could use him for nationalistic propaganda like Nast himself did.

The album was released in Colombia on December 8, 2008, and in the United States and Puerto Rico the following week. In Colombia, "Dos" went straight to number one in the album charts in its debut week. The album features the lead single and the official song of the year in Colombia, "Tú No Eres Para Mi" ("You Are Not For Me").
Album information.
The album was greeted with huge anticipation following the success of the lead single "Tú No Eres Para Mi". The hit was number one on Colombian radio for eleven weeks. As well as this, there were high expectations considering the success of Fanny's first album, "Lágrimas Cálidas" (English: "Warm Tears"), which spent nine weeks at number one in Colombia. Fanny Lú produced the album and co-wrote many of the tracks, most notably "Un Minuto Más" (English: "One More Minute"), a duet with Noel Schajris. The song is a tribute to her late father who was murdered. Weeks before the release of the album, Fanny stated that "We were looking for a fusion of sounds. I didn't limit myself. I gave myself the luxury of exploring, because it was important not to repeat what I'd done. For example, many times, instead of accordions, we experimented with winds. This album is like a walk along all those genres I love, and all the songs have their own palate and color."

Isaac Agree Downtown Synagogue

The Isaac Agree Downtown Synagogue is a Jewish synagogue in Detroit, Michigan. As of 2008, it was the only congregationally-owned synagogue building still used as a synagogue within Detroit proper; however, the Reconstructionist Congregation of Detroit, an active Jewish congregation, conducts regular worship services in a high-rise residential building in the Lafayette Park neighborhood just east of Detroit's central business district.
The Isaac Agree Memorial Society was formed in 1921 by the Agree, Canvasser, Kaplan, Rosin and Zatkin families. The synagogue has gone through two periods where it did not own a permanent building. The congregation purchased its current location on Griswold Street and Clifford Street from the former Fyntex department store, marking its third home. In years past, the shul had hundreds of members, joined by Jewish businessmen visiting and working in the city. 600 worshipers attended the synagogue's High Holiday services in 2007, which were open to all.
As recently as 2000, the congregation drew 25 to 30 worshipers for Shabbat services on Saturday mornings. Rabbi Noah Gamze, who had been the synagogue's leader, died in 2003, and has not been replaced since. The Shabbat morning prayer services are the only weekly scheduled services now offered by the synagogue.
Patrons and staff of a neighboring club have joined together to develop a plan to help revitalize the synagogue, hoping not just to save the building but to make it a "a hub for the people returning to the city and the energy that represents", according to a member of the group. A contractor estimated that it would cost $450,000 to repair the building and convert the top two floors into live / work space, hoping to reach out to the young and educated people who are moving into the center city area. The group has approached the board with the proposal.

Primary enamel cuticle

Primary enamel cuticle, also called Nasmyth's membrane, is thin membrane of tissue also known as reduced enamel epithelium produced by the ameloblast, that covers the tooth once it has erupted. This tissue is primarily basal lamina. It is usually worn away by mastication and cleaning. The primary enamel cuticle protects enamel from resorption by cells of the dental sac and also secretes desmolytic enzymes for elimination of the dental sac, allowing fusion between reduced enamel epithelium and oral epithelium. This process allows eruption of the tooth without bleeding.

Sullivan received his high school education at St. Peter's Preparatory School, his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University and his law degree from Harvard Law School. During World War II he served in the United States Navy as a combat intelligence officer.
In 1945 he was appointed as a judge in the 2nd District Court of Jersey City. After the 1947 Constitution changed the structure of the New Jersey judiciary, he sat in the same county, but now as Presiding Judge of the Hudson County District Court. In 1953, he was elevated to the New Jersey Superior Court. In 1959, Chief Justice Joseph Weintraub, of the New Jersey Supreme Court, assigned him to the Appellate Division of Superior Court. Sullivan was appointed to the New Jersey Supreme Court by Governor William T. Cahill and was sworn in on March 23, 1973. During his eight years on the court he authored many decisions, including the initial reversal of the murder conviction of boxer Rubin "Hurricane" Carter. Sullivan retired from the New Jersey Supreme Court under the mandatory retirement provision of the New Jersey Constitution on August 11, 1981. Sullivan, however, continued to serve the judiciary as an adjunct judge in the Superior Court in Monmouth County, and in such high-profile cases as the recount of the gubernatorial election in 1981. Sullivan also accepted a number of administrative assignments for the N.J. Supreme Court, including several years service as the chairmanship of the New Jersey Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct.
Sullivan was married to Mary Josephine Hamill, the daughter of Congressman James A. Hamill. Justice Sullivan's wife predeceased him by two years. They had one son.

Martin Wilkes Heron

Martin Wilkes Heron (July 4, 1850 – April 17, 1920) was an Irish American bartender, saloon-keeper, and liquor manufacturer best known for creating the liqueur known as Southern Comfort. He is often credited as being the "original mixologist" long before the term became widely popular. 
Heron was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of an immigrant boat-builder. 
According to the Brown-Forman Corporation (manufacturers of Southern Comfort), in the early 1870s Heron was living in New Orleans, working as a liquor rectifier and bar tender. According to company "legend" Heron created the formula for Southern Comfort (reportedly originally known as "Cuffs and Buttons") in 1874 while working at Arthur McCauley’s saloon at the southeast corner of the intersection of Richard Street and South Peters Street in the Lower Garden District section of New Orleans.
By 1883 Heron had returned to St. Louis, where he was employed by A.M. Hellman & Company Liquor Wholesalers. Helman & Co. was a partnership owned by Abraham Hellman and Myer Harris, located at 122 Pine St. in downtown St. Louis. Heron lived at 3004 Pine.
He later moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he operated as a "Liquor Dealer". Heron's Memphis business (and residence) was located at 515 Main St. 1889 Heron patented his formula, and began selling it in sealed bottles with the slogans, "W.H. Heron's Famous Southern Comfort" and "None Genuine But Mine". By 1890, Heron hired an assistant, Grant M. Peoples who served as clerk and book keeper. Peoples worked with him for the rest of his life, producing and marketing Southern Comfort.
By 1910 Heron returned to St. Louis, Missouri, where he operated a drinking establishment on the St Louis river front and continued to market Southern Comfort. He served a "St. Louis Cocktail" which included Southern Comfort. His bar featured a sign which informed patrons: "Two per customer. No Gentleman would ask for more." Mr. Heron's "saloon" was famed for the high quality of his liquors, its "ante-bellum gentility", and the host's skill as a raconteur. 
"Gould's St Louis Red Book" (a city business directory) located Heron's saloon at 319 Pine Street near the St. Louis riverfront. The former location of Heron's tavern is approximately 1000 feet from the north leg of Gateway Arch at the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial (the current day location of the garden cafe at the St. Louis Crowne Plaza Hotel).
In his old age, Wilkes lived at 4950 McPherson Ave, in a St. Louis neighborhood now known as the Central West End. Martin Wilkes Heron died in St. Louis on April 17, 1920. He left an estate valued in excess of $90,000 (in 1921) with the majority of assets being distributed to family members. His Pine street establishment and his liquor patents were left to his business associate Mr. Peoples. Heron is buried in his family's plot in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis He does not have an individual headstone, but his grave lies directly in front of the family plot marker, which is topped by an individual stone dedicated to his sister Margaret.
Awards.
In 1900, the liqueur was awarded a gold medal at the Exposition Universalle (the 1900 Paris World's Fair).
In 1904 Heron was awarded a Gold Medal for Southern Comfort at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (the St. Louis World's Fair).

Cyclemys

Cyclemys is a genus of freshwater turtles, commonly referred to as Asian leaf turtles, from the family Geoemydidae. The genus occurs throughout Southeast and South Asia, and currently contains seven species.
Asian leaf turtles average in length. They are mostly brown to greenish in color, with round to rectangular shells. Their carapaces bear a superficial resemblance to plant leaves, hence their common name. They can be found around shallow, slow-moving bodies of water in hilly forests. Adults are primarily terrestrial, though juveniles are more aquatic.
Taxonomy and nomenclature.
"Cyclemys" turtles belong to the family Geoemydidae under the subfamily Geoemydinae. They were first described in 1834 by English zoologist Thomas Bell in his work "A Monograph of the Testudinata". "Cyclemys" and closely related genera ("Cuora", "Pyxidea", and "Notochelys") are believed to have diverged from a common "Heosemys"-like ancestor.
"Cyclemys" taxonomy and phylogeny have been historically difficult to ascertain due to the morphological similarity between species, as well as changes in the color patterns during growth. Until recently, the genus was thought to comprise only one or two morphologically variable species, "C. dentata" and "C. oldhamii". Subsequent investigation has now put the number of species under the genus to seven, though this remains controversial. The status of "C. enigmatica" as a valid species is contested, as is the recognition of "C. atripons" and "C. pulchristiata", both of which are nearly impossible to tell apart morphologically.-->
Previously recognized species, "C. tcheponensis" ( = "C. tiannanensis") and "C. shanensis", have been merged into "C. oldhamii" following mtDNA sequencing. The conclusions of which showed that the morphological differences between them (the presence or absence of neck/head stripes, and hatchling color patterns) were not enough to classify them as separate species. "C. ovata" has been similarly subsumed into "C. dentata".
The two distinct morphological differences between "Cyclemys" species are based on the main color of their plastrons - species with yellow bellies ("C. atripons", "C. dentata", and "C. pulchristiata"), and species with dark bellies ("C. enigmatica", "C. fusca", "C. gemeli", and "C. oldhamii").
Synonyms of "Cyclemys" ("ex errore") include: "Cyclemus" Li, "Cyclemis" Good, and "Cyclemy" Mao.
The generic name "Cyclemys" comes from Greek κύκλος (meaning 'round' or 'circle', referring to the shape of the carapace) and εμύς ('freshwater turtle'). They are known under the common name Asian leaf turtles or simply leaf turtles, again because of the appearance of their carapaces. They share the collective name 'leaf turtles' with turtles of the genus "Geoemyda", as well as turtles with 'leaf' in their names, such as the Annam leaf turtle ("Mauremys annamensis"), among others. 'Asian leaf turtle' is also the specific common name of "C. dentata".
Description.
"Cyclemys" turtles are characterized by more or less round carapaces, which are typically dark green, brownish, tan, or olive in color. The shell may have a prominent vertebral keel running from head to tail. Serrated marginal scutes are common in juveniles. In adults, only the posterior marginal scutes are serrated.
Adults of "Cyclemys" also develop a joint in the middle of their plastrons (known as a plastral hinge), enabling them to articulate the front and rear halves to some extent. Unlike the closely related "Cuora", which can completely close its shell because of the hinge, "Cyclemys" plastral hinges only close the shell partially. The plastral hinge may also play a significant role in facilitating egg-laying in adult females.
A distinguishing characteristic of the genus is the secondary division of the abdominal scutes (the middle pair of scutes in the plastron) due to the development of the plastral hinge as the turtle matures. It eventually leads to the formation of small triangular additional scutes between the abdominal and pectoral scutes.
"Cyclemys" turtles are cryptodires, having the ability to pull their heads straight back and vertically into their shells instead of folding them sideways like pleurodires. The head varies between species from dull to striped with bright red or orange bands of color. The plastron can have a dark or light (tan to yellow) background which can be uniform or patterned with fine lines radiating from the center of each plastral scute.
Their feet are partially webbed and well developed for either aquatic or terrestrial mobility. They can grow to about in length.
"Cyclemys" species achieve sexual maturity after seven to 12 years, earlier for males and later for females. Sexual dimorphism is apparently mostly absent, though females are likely to outgrow males. Females usually deposit 10 to 15 eggs per clutch.
Lifespan.
A "C. dentata" individual has been recorded living up to 14.7 years in captivity. However, an adult specimen caught in the wild has also been recorded living another 14 years, making it likely that the maximum lifespan of "Cyclemys" species has been underestimated.
Distribution and habitat.
The distribution ranges of individual species of "Cyclemys" remain unclear, but the genus occurs in South Asia and Indochina (Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Burma, Thailand, central to southern China, Bangladesh, Nepal, and northeastern India), as well as the Southeast Asian countries of Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and the Philippines.
Adults spend most of their time on land. They can be found near ponds, streams, and other shallow, slow-moving bodies of water in hilly forests. Although more common in lower elevations, they have been found in higher elevations exceeding above sea level.
They are omnivorous, but juveniles tend to be more carnivorous. Because their prey are typically aquatic, the younger turtles are found in water more often than adults.
Species.
The species are listed alphabetically along with common names, identifying adult characteristics, and known geographical distribution. They are divided into two morphologically distinct groups.
Dark-bellied species.
Several species previously classified under "Cyclemys" — "C. amboinensis", "C. flavomarginata", "C. mouhotti", and "C. trifasciata" — are now classified under the genus "Cuora". "C. annandalii" is now classified under "Heosemys", "C. annamensis" under "Mauremys", and "C. giebelii" as "Notochelys platynota".
Conservation.
"Cyclemys" species are often caught and sold for the pet trade, food, or traditional medicine. In August 25, 1998, Forest Protection authorities of Vietnam confiscated a shipment of about 700 turtles with an estimated 30 individuals of "C. oldhamii". In May 2007, more than 3000 individuals of "Cyclemys", along with Asian box turtles, were confiscated in hundreds of crates in Yangjiang, China.
The most commonly encountered species of "Cyclemys" in the pet trade, "C. dentata", is now being captive bred. They are usually preferred, as they are healthier, more acclimated to handling, and captive breeding minimizes the impact on wild populations. 
The confusion over their exact taxonomy and distribution led to an incomplete assessment of their conservation status by the IUCN. In 1991, with only two species recognized, "Cyclemys" was given the Action Plan Rating of 3 - in need of some conservation action. In the last assessment in 2000 by the Asian Turtle Trade Working Group of IUCN, the different species currently recognized under the genus "Cyclemys" were treated as all belonging to the species "C. dentata". This resulted in the current incorrect classification of all of the species as Lower Risk/Near Threatened. Until now, the true conservation status, the actual effects of wildlife trade, deforestation, and habitat loss on individual "Cyclemys" species, have yet to be studied.

Taste of Apples

Taste of Apples is the name of an English language translation of collected short stories of the Taiwanese writer Huang Chunming. The translation is by Howard Goldblatt and was published in 2001 by Columbia University Press.
(An earlier version of Goldblatt's translations was published by Indiana University under the title "The Drowning of an Old Cat and Other Stories" in 1980.
Subject Matter and Major Themes.
Huang Chunming's subject matter is the people of Taiwan.
One aspect of their lives that his stories treat is the way in which their lives contrast with Mainlanders and Mainland culture. An important theme is the influence of language (Taiwanese Hokkien vs. Mandarin Chinese) on keeping these two groups of people distinct.
A related theme is change and the impact of modernity. Huang Chunming wrote in the introduction to the English translation, "In the sixties and seventies, when the modern world began making inroads into the out-of-the-way town of Lanyang, where I was born, the conflicts between the new and the old created a rich source of powerful and dramatic material. Whenever my antennae detected the new dramas being played out in my hometown, the desire to write about them raged inside me."
Motifs.
Huang Chunming's characters are native Taiwanese fishermen and villagers, and often have Taiwan's trademark "Ah" prefix on their names. His stories are full of neighborhood temples and folk religion observances, banyan trees, bonito fish, sparrows and sweet potatoes, and the blazing tropical sun is a prop in nearly every story. His characters often exhibit strong and even mystical attachment to their natural surroundings, including explicit expressions of fengshui ideas.
Story Synopses.
"The Fish".
This story provides a glimpse into the nuanced interactions between a grandfather from a Taiwan mountain village and his teenage grandson, who is coming of age and gaining experience of the larger world.
"The Drowning of an Old Cat".
A typical band of Huang Chunming characters, all in their 70s—Uncle Cow's Eye, Uncle Earthworm, Uncle Yuzai, and Uncle Ah-zhuan, led by Uncle Ah-sheng—venture forth from their usual hangout (the neighborhood temple, in the shade of the banyan tree) to challenge the coming of a modern swimming pool to their rural town.
They represent barriers to translational activities that are ongoing in China by this period.
"His Son's Big Doll".
This story probes the roiling thoughts and emotions of an uneducated man as he juggles the challenges of finding employment, relating to his wife, providing for his son . . . and maintaining dignity.
The story provides an example of quintessential Huang Chunming narrative: unadorned observation of the fundamental human condition ("They seemed to shed a heavy emotional burden simultaneously -- he having seen his wife walk through the door, she having seen her husband drink some tea") juxtaposed with wry examples of the incongruity and provocativeness of modernizing Taiwan (the protagonist's occupation is "sandwich-man" or "ad man" - shouldering billboards for a movie theater and dressed in the costume of a nineteenth-century European military officer").
The story was adapted into a film entitled "The Sandwich Man" directed by Hou Hsiao-hsien.
"The Gong".
This story is an empathetic account of an old, derelict, and hungry man. The two main threads of the story are the man's loss of employment as a town crier (complete with attention-getting gong) due to the advent of more modern forms of communication, and the man's reluctant entry into a company of funeral followers. The story realistically captures the twin torments of his material desperation and his ambivalence about his new "friends."
The group that the man falls in with—the arhat vagrants—is a classic collection of down-on-their-luck locals: Scabby Head, Turtle, Know-It-All, Fire Baby, Blockhead, One-Eye, Gold Clock. They hang out under a tree across from the coffinmaker's shop, waiting to be called upon to assist at funerals.
"Ringworms".
This brief story describes a few hours in the life of a low-class husband and wife in Taiwan, together with their gaggle of children. Their concerns range from day-to-day subsistence, how to snatch some brief moments of intimacy, and how to broach touchy subjects like birth control.
"The Taste of Apples".
For a native Taiwan man who has migrated with his family to the urban north of Taiwan, everything changes when he is riding his bicycle and is hit by the limousine of an American military officer.
The apples the family eats in the hospital symbolize the instantaneous change in circumstances: a heretofore unaffordable luxury in the Taiwanese context will now be a commonplace as their lives are touched by the American presence.
"Xiaoqi's Cap".
This story involves two greenhorn salesmen, one of whom has a "bad attitude" which rapidly evolves in the course of events.
The story includes elements that can be read as metaphors for the social situation in Taiwan: a pressure cooker that explodes and a cap that disguises disfiguring marks on an innocent little girl's head.
"The Two Sign Painters".
Two rural men have migrated to the city and now find themselves working on towering buildings. Their suddenly heightened visual perspective is complicated further when they become the center of official and media attention and get a taste of "all news, all the time" culture . . . .
"Sayonara / Zaijian".
This story concerns a Taiwanese trading company employee who must act as a "pimp" in the course of entertaining visiting businessmen from Japan who want to visit a hot spring hotel.
The story addresses wide-ranging feelings of ambivalence and confusion in a society that has a complicated history of relations with Japan, and is experiencing rapidly changing mores.
In a tour-de-force of imaginative dialog writing, Huang Chunming describes how the Taiwanese man avails himself of artiful use of language to simultaneously humble the group of visiting Japanese businessmen and to upbraid a misguided Chinese literature student.

Gid Gardner

Franklin Washington "Gid" Gardner (May 6, 1859 – August 1, 1914) was a Major League Baseball player during the 19th century. Between 1879 and 1888, Gardner played all or part of seven seasons for eight different teams in three different major leagues. He appeared in 199 games, mostly as an outfielder, but also spent some time as a second baseman and pitcher. He had a career batting average of .233 and a pitching record of 2–12.
Career.
Gardner was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1859. He played on several amateur baseball teams in Cambridge until 1878. In 1879, he started his professional baseball career with the National Association's Worcester Grays, batting .188 in nine games. He then joined the National League's Troy Trojans and made his major league debut on August 23. He pitched in two games for Troy that year and lost both. The following season, Gardner played for the Cleveland Blues; he made nine starts, going 1–8 with a 2.57 earned run average.
Gardner spent 1881 in the Eastern Championship Association and 1882 in the League Alliance. He started 1883 with the Camden Merritts of the Interstate Association, but the team disbanded in July, and he was acquired by the American Association's Baltimore Orioles. Gardner was mostly an outfielder for Baltimore. Over the rest of the season, he played in 42 games and batted .273.
Gardner started 1884 with the Orioles. He played 41 games for them, batting .214, and then finished the season in the Union Association, batting .255 there. He returned to Baltimore in 1885 and hit .218 while playing mostly at second base. Gardner then went back down to the minors in 1886. He played 56 games for the Southern Association's Charleston Seagulls and batted .262. In 1887, he became captain of the New England League's Boston Blues, where he "reached the height of his fame," and also appeared in 18 games for the National League's Indianapolis Hoosiers. While at Indianapolis, Gardner became part of the first known platoon arrangement in baseball, as he split time with left-handed hitting Tom Brown. Gardner had a .175 batting average in his 18 games.
In October 1887, Gardner was traded to the Washington Nationals. He played one game for Washington before being traded in May 1888, to the Philadelphia Quakers, for Cupid Childs and cash. Gardner appeared in one game for Philadelphia, but Childs refused to report to the Nationals, and the trade was nullified. Gardner returned to Washington and played his final major league game on May 29.
In 1889, Gardner played for the Central Interstate League's Evansville Hoosiers. In early 1890, he signed with the John P. Lovell semi-professional team, and by August was with a team based in Norwich, Connecticut. Gardner then ended his professional baseball career the following season with Worcester of the New England League.
After his baseball days were over, Gardner lived in Cambridge and "had no steady employment." He was working as a traveling salesman when, in 1914, he was confined to the Cambridge Hospital for several weeks before dying of an aneurysm of the aorta. According to Gardner's obituary in "Sporting Life", from 1878 until about 1890 he "was one of the best ball players in the country." Gardner was buried in Cambridge City Cemetery.

Woody Island (Alaska)

Woody Island is located in Chiniak Bay, east of Kodiak, Alaska. It was originally settled by the native Alutiiq people who called themselves Tangirnarmiut, "the people of Tangirnaq." They inhabited and used Woody Island for thousands of years. The Russians established an agricultural colony on Woody Island in 1792. It was officially designated Wood Island in 1894 by the US Post Office and was the primary coastal settlement for commerce and trade for many years. The first road in Alaska was built on Woody Island. Aside from the Aleut presence, the island has gone through four periods of occupation by non-natives, and is largely unoccupied today. The island is approximately 2.8 miles long from north to south and 1.8 miles wide and 13 miles in circumference.
Aleut settlement.
The Alutiiq people used the island for "whaling, fishing, wood-working, sweat-baths, extensive trade," and build "large multi-roomed houses, and large villages with complex social ranking." When the Russians arrived in the 18th century, the native people were initially successful in driving them off. There followed a short period of accommodation and trade, after which the Russians engaged in brutal subjugation of the people, resulting in "epidemics, forced relocations, and extermination of those who resisted." 
Russian naval officer Gavriil Davydov observed an Aleut winter ceremony on Woody Island in 1802. He wrote:
In 1805 a village on the east side of Woody Island was inhabited by 54 Alutiiq people. A smallbox epidemic struck the region in 1837 and the Russians forcefully amalgamated the survivors into seven villages, among them a village on Woody Island.
Industry and commerce.
The Russian American Commercial Company operated an ice company on the island beginning in 1852. They dammed Lake Tanignak, increasing its depth substantially. They cut and shipped ice south to California. The company brought in the first iron rails to haul ice and horses to power a horse-powered saw which cut the ice into blocks. A sawmill was built to produce not lumber, but sawdust that was used to insulate the ice for shipment south. The first road built in Alaska was graded around the island to allow the horses to be exercised. In 1867 the company was renamed the Kodiak Ice Co. 
For much of the late half of the 19th century, many of the Aluttiq people on Woody Island were enslaved by the Russians to work for the ice harvesting companies during the winter. Conscripted by the Russians, they hunted sea otters and fur seals during the summer for their highly prized fur. In 1872 a Russian Orthodox Church was built on Woody Island. The church exerted a strong influence over the native population, replacing in many instances native ceremonies and observances with church-centered activities. 
The sea otter and fur seal populations declined rapidly in the latter half of the 19th century due to over-harvesting, with about 100,000 sea otters and a correspondingly high number of fur seals being taken each year. By 1911 only about 2000 sea otters remained in 13 small remnant populations, making hunting unprofitable. Commercial taking of sea otters and fur seals were prohibited by the Fur Seal Treaty. The Aleuts were permitted to hunt them for subsistence purposes only. 
In 1886, the Island was the commercial center for the Kodiak area. Services included the ice harvesting operation, a boat yard, a grist mill, the Alaska Commercial Company (formerly the Russian-American Company) wharf, and the only roads in Alaska connecting these facilities. The North American Commercial Company, a fur trading enterprise, established a presence there in 1891, including a store.
Religious usage.
Ernest and Ida Roscoe built a Baptist Mission and orphanage on Woody Island in 1893. Over the next twenty years, the mission added a girls' quarters, boys' dormitory, office building, barn, carpenter shop, cannery, silo, and dining room. The mission provided homes for Aleut children who had lost their parents, but the Baptist missionaries sometimes brought children to the orphanage, even against their parents’ will. The main building burned down in 1925, was rebuilt, and burned again in 1937. The mission was then relocated to Kodiak on the mainland where a greater variety of services were more readily available.
U.S. Navy wireless station.
The United States Navy built a wireless station on the island in 1911. It included two large masts tall. During the eruption of the Novarupta volcano on the Alaska Peninsula in 1912, over of ash was deposited on the island. Everyone but the watchman evacuated to Kodiak. During the ash fall, lightning struck one of the antenna which started a fire that burned most of the wireless station. Harry Martin, a survivor of the volcanic eruption, told U.S. Navy radioman Bart Phelps about the experience in 1924:
The wireless station was rebuilt and updated in 1914. The wireless station was decommissioned on February 28, 1931, and shortly thereafter the Federal government allowed the Territory of Alaska to use the remaining buildings for the Longwood School. 
After the mission and orphanage was relocated to the mainland, the entire island's population declined rapidly. The Longwood School enrollment dropped from 71 in 1937 to 20 in 1939, and the school was permanently closed. Many of the natives moved to Kodiak where they were less dependent on subsistence living and could find jobs.
Air station built.
In 1941, the Civil Aeronautics Administration built the Kadiak Naval Air Station including a runway, flight service station, remote air ground, remote transmitter, low frequency range beacon, and VHF link terminal facilities. These gathered and relayed weather and other aeronautical data to pilots. During World War II up to forty technicians and their families lived on the island. They maintained the teletypes, transmitters, and radio receivers essential to supporting military and civilian aircraft operating in the North Pacific. 
In 1951 or 1952 the Russian Orthodox Church building, which had been abandoned for many years, was torn down. Former Navy facilities were converted to apartments and a school was built on in 1951 for the small community. The facility was automated in the early 1970s and the majority of the remaining FAA complex burned in 1979.
Current use.
During the 1950s, the American Baptist Church began offering a non-denominational summer camp on the island, which is still in operation today. The FAA still maintains a radio beacon on the island for aircraft directional use. There is no longer any public transportation to the island. The island is inhabited today by two "hermits" and is visited by two families owning summer homes there. The majority of land on Woody Island is private property, except for a wilderness area belonging to Alaska State Parks.

Parque Municipal Summit

The Parque Municipal Summit (Summit Municipal Park) is a botanical garden and a zoo of in total area (of which belong to the botanical garden), which is located on the outskirts of Panama City at about kilometer 18 on the road leading to Gamboa.
History.
The park was created in 1923 by the former company of the Panama Canal, as the "Experimental Farm Summit", to test the adaptation of plants’ species from different parts of the world to the tropical climate of Panama. It was through this experimental farm that teak was introduced to the American continent.
In the 1960s a small zoo was started within the Botanical Garden. The zoo has increased gradually, and today is home to about 300 animals. One of the attractions of the zoo is the harpy eagle; the national bird of Panama. 
The land was transferred back to Panama as part the Torrijos-Carter treaties, and was part of the Soberanía National Park created by Executive Decree No. 13 on May 27, 1980. In 1985, the area covered by this park was transferred to the administration of the Mayor’s office of Panama, thus establishing the Municipal Park and part of the restructured area into a "Botanical Garden", converting it into a research center for development of tropical biology and horticulture.
Plants.
The botanical garden includes a representation of plant species from tropical and subtropical countries around the world as well as native species of Panama. Many of them have beneficial uses for humans as food, medicines, construction materials, or ornamental use.
Animals.
Animals at the zoo include squirrels, alligators, owls, coyote, gray herons, gulls, parrots, jaguars, ocelots, monkeys, agouti, pumas, doves, foxes, lizards, and harpy eagles.

Nirvana bootleg recordings

The Nirvana bootleg recordings are a number of audio CD recordings of musical performances by the American rock band Nirvana, which were never officially released by the band, or under any other legal authority. The recordings consist of both live performances and outtakes from studio sessions unavailable as a legal release.
Overview.
Nirvana was formed by singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987, and featured drummer Dave Grohl for the majority of the band's career. They had previously gone through a succession of drummers, most notably Chad Channing, Dale Crover and Dan Peters. Jason Everman was briefly added as a second guitarist in 1989. Pat Smear joined the band as a touring guitarist in 1993. Although Nirvana existed for less than a decade, they released four studio albums, starting with 1989's "Bleach", followed by their major label breakthrough album, "Nevermind" in 1991. "In Utero" was released in 1993, just seven months prior to Cobain's death in April 1994. Also released in 1992 was "Incesticide".
As Nirvana's popularity grew following the success of "Nevermind", unreleased recordings of the band began to surface in the form of unofficial bootleg CDs, often originating from companies in Europe and Japan. The sound quality and album art would frequently range from appalling to appealing, sometimes sounding like and resembling something of a legitimate release. Some of the recordings came from "tape trading" circles while others may have been recorded or obtained specifically for the bootleg CD. Material was sometimes gathered from already existing vinyl bootlegs or other bootleg CDs as they became available. Additionally, songs issued only as a b-side or compilation track became frequent candidates for use as filler material. Nirvana would not see any royalties from these releases, nor would they have anything to do with their production. The first Nirvana bootleg CD was released in 1992 by Post Script, simply titled "Europe 1991". Since then, hundreds of recordings of concerts, demos and various unreleased material have surfaced in this format.
The official release "Incesticide" was issued in late 1992, including demos, outtakes and radio sessions, some of which were previously circulating in lower quality on bootleg CDs. Despite "MTV Unplugged in New York" being released less than a year after the performance occurred, it would still become one of the bands most bootlegged shows. After the first several installments of the unofficial "Outcesticide" collection surfaced, the official live album "From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah" was released in 1996, containing various performances recorded between 1989 and 1994. It should also be noted that the official "With the Lights Out" box set was released in 2004, which included many rare, unreleased recordings, while the official "Live at Reading" debuted Nirvana's now classic 1992 Reading Festival performance in 2009, after years of endless bootlegging.
Due to the fact that there is an uncountable number of unofficial releases and their accompanying versions, below is a partial list of the most sought after and talked about bootleg CD recordings, including the "A Season in Hell Part One" box set, the "Into the Black" box set, and the complete "Outcesticide" series. Since bootleg CDs are notorious for including erroneously listed information pertaining to song titles, dates and venues, the information below has omitted any false listings and replaced them with the correct information.
A Season in Hell Part One.
"A Season in Hell Part One" is a bootleg CD box set manufactured in Italy and released by Banzai in 1994. The collection is housed in a matte finish, square box that also includes a 7"x7" booklet with 24 pages of photographs and information on the recordings featured in the set. Spanning the three disc, 66-track collection are two shows from 1990, several demos, some rare live material, various b-sides and compilation tracks. This is one of only two bootleg CD releases to feature the Off Ramp Café performance, and the only to feature the Town Pump show. A portion of the box set would later be officially released on "With the Lights Out". In 1996, the inferior "A Season In Hell Part Two" was released by Razor's Edge, containing the 1994 Le Zénith show and an array of miscellaneous material, most of which was lifted from the "Outcesticide" series and official releases.

Into the Black.
"Into the Black" is a six CD box set released by Tribute in 1994, which is often considered the preferred Nirvana bootleg box set due to it being compiled by a knowledgeable fan. It is housed in a glossy box, including a 22-page booklet made of thick cardstock. Several recordings were obtained specifically for the set and it contains a large amount of material that had not yet surfaced up to the time of its release. The extensive 116-track collection includes demo recordings, two band-made compilations, the 1992 Reading Festival performance and BBC radio sessions from Maida Vale Studios. The set also contains two Seattle shows; the 1991 Halloween homecoming performance for their North American "Nevermind" tour, and their last ever American show in 1994. Following "Into the Black", Tribute released the 2-CD companion piece, "New Year's Eve", featuring Nirvana's 1993 performance at the Oakland Coliseum as well as the 1988 "Sub Pop 200" record release show in Seattle.

The "Outcesticide" albums are the most well known Nirvana bootleg CD series in existence and carries a name recognition second only to Nirvana's official releases. These unofficial compilation albums consisted of live material, demo recordings, television appearances, radio performances and other various unreleased material. Although Blue Moon Records originally produced the series and manufactured multiple pressings throughout the 1990s, they have been endlessly cloned, with counterfeit versions accounting for the majority of the market. Other companies to later issue the series included Darkside Records, Red Robin Records and Kobra Records, among others.

The Flip (album)

The Flip is an album by jazz saxophonist Hank Mobley recorded on July 12, 1969 in Paris, France and released on the Blue Note label. It features performances by Mobley with Dizzy Reece, Slide Hampton, Vince Benedetti, Alby Cullaz and Philly Joe Jones. 
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 4 stars stating "In all, Flip is a very worthwhile side to add to the Mobley shelf. But hurry, being part of the Blue Note Connoisseur series with its fantastic sonic reproduction has its downside -- titles featured in it go out of print quickly -- even if they deserve to be continually available.".

<doc id="20763865" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20763865" title="Leishmania donovani">
Leishmania donovani

Leishmania donovani is a species of intracellular parasitic protozoan belonging to the genus "Leishmania", a group of haemoflagellate kinetoplastids that cause the disease leishmaniasis. It is a human blood parasite responsible for visceral leishmaniasis or "kala-azar", the most severe form of leishmaniasis. It infects the mononuclear phagocyte system including spleen, liver and bone marrow. Infection is transmitted by species of sandfly belonging to the genus "Phlebotomus" in Old World and "Lutzomyia" in New World. Therefore the parasite is prevalent throughout tropical and temperate regions including Africa (mostly in Sudan), China, India, Nepal, southern Europe, Russia and South America. It is responsible for thousands of deaths every year and has spread to 88 countries, with 350 million people at constant risk of infection and 0.5 million new cases in a year.
"L. donovani" was independently discovered by two British medical officers William Boog Leishman in Netley, England, and Charles Donovan in Madras, India, in 1903. However the correct taxonomy was provided by Ronald Ross. The parasite requires two different hosts for a complete life cycle, humans as the definitive host and sandflies as the intermediate host. In some parts of the world other mammals, especially canines, act as reservoir hosts. In human cell they exist as small, spherical and unflagellated amastigote form; while they are elongated with flagellum as promastigote form in sandflies. Unlike other parasitic protists they are unable to directly penetrate the host cell, and are dependent upon phagocytosis. The whole genome sequence of "L. donovani" obtained from southeastern Nepal was published in 2011.
Discovery.
One of the earliest known epidemics of "L. donovi" infection ("kala-azar" as it was called in Hindi) was known in India just after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The first medical record was however only in 1870 by British medical officers from Assam. In 1900 an English soldier stationed at Dum Dum, West Bengal, died at the Army Medical School in Netley, England. The autopsy was performed by William Boog Leishman. He processed the tissue sample of the enlarged spleen using a staining technique (now known as Leishman's stain) which he had just developed, and discovered the protozoan parasites using microscope. But he mistakenly considered the parasite as degenerate trypanosomes, already known protozoan parasites in Africa and South America. In 1903 Leishman published his discovery of "trypanosomes in India" in the "British Medical Journal", which appeared on 11 May. Another British medical officer Charles Donovan, who was serving in the Indian Medical Service, had found the parasites in April of that year at the Government General Hospital in Madras. After reading Leishman paper, Donovan confirmed on 17 June that the parasites (by then known as "Leishman bodies") were definitely the causative agents of "kala-azar". He wrote a commentary of his discovery in relation to that of Leishman in the same journal, and appeared on 11 July 1903. Soon a controversy arose as to whom such monumental discovery should be credited. Donovan sent some of his slides to Ronald Ross, who was at the time in Liverpool, and to Alphonse Laveran at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Laveran and his colleague Félix Mesnil identified the protozoan (and yet wrongly) to be members of Piroplasmida, and gave the scientific name "Piroplasma donovanii". It was Ross who resolved the conflict of priority in the discovery and correctly identified the species as member of the novel genus "Leishmania". He gave the popular name "Leishman-Donovan bodies", and subsequently the valid binomial "Leishmania donovani", thereby equally crediting the two rivals. 
Structure.
"Leishmania donovani" is a unicellular eukaryote having well-defined nucleus and other cell organelles including kinetoplast and flagellum. Depending on its host it exists in two structural variants, as follows: 
Infection and life cycle.
"Leishmania donovani" is a digenetic parasite passing its life cycle in two different hosts.
Definitive host.
In humans the metacyclic promastigotes are injected by sandfly through the skin during its blood meal. When sandfly bites using its proboscis it ejects the parasites that are stored inside the hollow tube. Some promastigotes may enter the blood stream directly where some are destroyed by macrophagic cytolysis. But many are also taken up through phagocytosis by mononuclear phagocytes in liver, spleen and bone marrow. Inside the cells they undergo spontaneous transformation into oval-shaped amastigotes. Granulocytes selectively kill the promastigotes by oxidative mechanism, while amastigotes are resistant. Then the surviving amastigotes undergo cell division using simple binary fission. Multiplication continues until the host cell can no longer hold and ruptures. In a fully congested cell there can be as many as 50 to 200 amastigotes, which are released into tissue cavities. Each individual amastigote is then capable of invading fresh cells. As a result the entire tissue is progressively infected and destroyed. A number of free amastigotes then enters the blood stream where many are phagocytosed by macrophages. These free and phagocytosed amastigotes in peripheral blood are then sucked up by blood-feeding sandfly. 
Intermediate host.
"L. donovani" undergo further development only in the digestive tract of female sandfly. Hence only females are responsible for transmitting the infection. Once the amastigotes are ingested, they enter the midgut of the sandfly. Then they undergo structural modification into flagellated promastigotes, becoming larger and considerably elongated. They get attached to the gut epithelial lining where they multiply rapidly by binary fission. They migrate back towards the anterior part of the digestive system such as pharynx and buccal cavity. This process is known as anterior station development, which is unique in "Leishmania". A heavy infection of pharynx can be observed within 6 to 9 days after initial blood meal. The promastigotes become infective only by this time, and the event is called the metacyclic stage. The metacyclic promastigotes then enter the hollow proboscis where they accumulate and completely block the food passage. Immediately upon biting a human, the parasites are released, which invariably results in infection. The stages of development in sandfly can be described as follows:
Reservoir host.
Dogs are known to be susceptible to "L. donovani" infection. Especially in the New World, infection is a zoonotic disease, involving different canine species, including domestic dog and the two fox species, "Lycalopex vetulus" and "Cerdocyon thous". In the Mediterranean region domestic dogs and the three fox species "Vulpes vulpes", "V. corsac" and "V. zerda" are common reservoir hosts. In Africa and Brazil, some marsupials and rodents are also reported to harbour "L. donovani." 
Epidemiology.
It is estimated that visceral leishmaniasis (VL) affects more than 100 million people worldwide, with 500,000 new cases and more than 50,000 deaths each year. Although "L. donovani" is only the second-most prevalent "Leishmania" causing VL, it is the most dangerous form and directly fatal to humans. Over 90% of reported cases are from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan and Brazil. In India it is prevalent in the eastern region including Bihar, West Bengal, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Assam and foothills of Sikkim. It is responsible for tens of thousands of mortality among Africans in eastern and southern parts of Sudan. During the epidemic of 1984–1994 death toll was as high as 70% in the Sudanese population. Moreover due to emergence of drug resistance the prevalence is not subsiding, and in fact has spread to central Europe. For example during the late 1990s hundreds of cases were reported in Switzerland. 
Pathogenicity.
"L. donovani" is the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, traditionally known as "kala-azar" ("black fever", particularly in India), because of its characteristic symptoms. The disease is a highly lethal if not treated properly. Incubation period generally ranges from 3 to 6 months, and in some cases may be over a year. In Indian leishmaniasis incubation can be as short as 10 days. The target cells are those of mononuclear phagocyte system. The two main tissues of infection are spleen and liver. Clinical symptoms include pyrexia (recurring high fever which may be continuous or remittent), enlargement of spleen and liver, and heavy skin pigmentation which darkens the physical appearance (the reason for naming "black fever"). To a lesser extent mucosa of the small intestine and lymph nodes are also invaded by the parasite. Morphological symptoms are noticeable particularly on facial and abdominal regions. Skin becomes coarse and hard. In African infections warty eruptions are common. In a fully developed stage, the patient show emaciation and anaemia. Where medical facilities are poor, mortality can be as high as 75–95% within 2 years of epidemics. The disease is often accompanied by complications with dysentery, tuberculosis, septicaemia and even HIV infection. 
Cellular invasion and immunological response.
Amastigotes of "L. donovani"enter macrophages via a Rac1- and Arf6-dependent process, and are found in phagocytic vacuoles that interact with endosomes and lysosomes and acquire lysosomal features. During phagocytosis by macrophages, the promastigotes inhibit the formation of phagolysosome, a cellular product by which invading pathogens are removed. The promastigote can do this using its glycolipid lipophosphoglycan (LPG) on its cell membrane. LPG causes disorganisation of F-actin and disruption of phagosomal lipid microdomains. They are capable of evading the microbicidal actions of macrophages, which can kill ordinary pathogens using reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates. They effectively subvert the production of reactive oxygen species. In this way the amastigotes are able to survive and replicate inside these primary immune systems. The parasites manipulate the cell signalling pathway of the macrophages, such as down-regulating of Jak/stat signalling, NO and TNF-α production, and also blocking NF-κB-dependent pathway. There are two major mechanisms of immune evasion such as induction of immune suppressive IL-10 responses and the generation of poor and functionally impaired CD8(+) T-cell responses. 
Treatment.
The conventional treatment method is an intravenous injection with antimony compounds, such as pentostam. Unfortunately these chemotherapeutics are so poisonous about 15% of the patients die from these injections. To compound the situation drug resistance has eveolved in the parasites against the traditional antimonials. According to rough estimates, about 40% of patients in India are already resistant to this therapy. Another antimicrobial drug amphotericin B is also commonly used. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) has been a drug of choice in India, but is practically useless in Africa because of low effectiveness in the African strain of the parasite. Further amphotericin B has severe adverse effects. Its acute effects includes nausea, vomiting, rigors, fever, hypertension or hypotension, and hypoxia, and its chronic effect is nephrotoxicity. In 1999 an anticancer drug miltefosine was demonstrated to be highly effective (95% cure rate) among Indian patients. This was the first time an oral drug is effective for visceral leishmaniasis. Further clinical trials showed that the new drug is relatively harmless. The most adverse effects were only vomiting and diarrhoea in 20-28% patients, which were rather mild. The drug has been officially approved in India. The recommended dosage is 100 mg per day over a period of four weeks. 
Evolution.
"L. donovani" is now considered as a complex species as indicated by different pathological symptoms occurring in different geographical areas where the species of the vector sandfly are also different. However none of the parasites are morphologically indistinguishable, except by molecular analysis. Molecular data show that genotype is strongly correlated with geographical origin. DNA sequencing of different geographical strains indicate that the protozoan complex can be classified into two valid taxons, "L. donovani" and "L. infantum". The genus "Leishmania" most likely originated in South America, from where it migrated to Asia. "L. donovani" and "L. infantum" diverged ~1 Mya, with further divergence of infraspecific genetic groups between 0.4 and 0.8 Mya.

Denai Alam

Denai Alam is a planned township located approximately 10 km north of the Shah Alam city centre alongside the Guthrie Corridor Expressway.
The township was developed by Sime Darby Property Development Sdn Bhd(formerly known as Guthrie Property Development Sdn Bhd), the property development arm of the Malaysian conglomerate, Sime Darby Berhad. The township is planned based on the “Denai” concept which is 4.8 km of landscaped footpaths for pedestrians and non-motorised vehicles. The Denai concept was inspired by traditional Malay kampong communal living and a low-density development of 8 units per acre. The Denai Alam development was awarded the 2003 Planning Innovation Award by the Malaysian Institute of Planners.
Denai Alam is located adjacent to Taman Bukit Subang, a smaller residential development also by Sime Darby Property Development Sdn Bhd.
To date (February 2009), Denai Alam has a population of approximately 1,000 residents and this is expected to increase to 35,000 when the development is completed.
Access.
Denai Alam can be accessed from major population centres in Klang Valley either through the Guthrie Corridor Expressway which in turn is connected to the New Klang Valley Expressway, or the NKVE and the North South Expressway Central Link, NSECL , () also known as the ELITE Highway or via State Road B9, more popularly known as Jalan Sungai Buloh.
Public transportation.
Currently there is no public transportation service to this township, however, RapidKL buses do ply the Bukit Subang – Subang Perdana (T608) route.
Public Amenities.
Based on the development plan, a mosque, a police station, a fire station, two community halls, primary and secondary schools will be built.

Joseph Louis Cook or Akiatonharónkwen (died October 1814) (Mohawk) was an Iroquois leader and soldier for the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Born to a black father and an Abenaki mother in what is now Quebec, he was adopted as a Mohawk at a village in New York where they settled. He became an influential leader among the Mohawk and distinguished himself as a warrior for the French during the French and Indian War. 
During the American Revolutionary War, Cook supported the rebel colonists and joined their fight. He became the highest-ranking Native American officer in the Continental Army, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel. He led Oneida warriors against the British in some actions. After the war, he settled in central New York State, where he became an important adviser to the Oneida. He represented them and the Seven Nations of Canada to negotiate with the government of New York state in trying to achieve more justice in postwar land deals.
Early life and education.
Cook was born as "Nia-man-rigounant" to an Abenaki mother and black father in Quebec. The family was taken captive in a French raid in 1745. A French officer planned to keep the boy as a slave, but the Mohawk intervened and gave him back to his mother. 
Out of gratitude, she took her son and followed the Mohawk warriors back to their village of Caughnawaga in New York. Cook was adopted into the tribe and grew up learning their culture and language. In the Mohawk language, he was named "Akiatonharónkwen", translates as "he unhangs himself from the group." Over the years, he also learned French, as he was educated by Jesuit missionaries in the village. 
Later he learned English as well. Among the English, he is most often referred to as Louis Cook or Colonel Louis.
French and Indian War.
Cook lived in the Mohawk village of "Caughnawaga." He fought with the Mohawk nation on the side of the French against the British and their colonists in the French and Indian War. A friend, Eleazer Williams, later wrote that Cook was at the battle against the Braddock expedition in 1755 (the Braddock party included the young George Washington), and served under General Montcalm at the Battle of Fort Oswego in 1756. The same year, he was wounded in a skirmish with Rogers' Rangers near Fort Ticonderoga. His first command came in the 1758 Battle of Carillon, where he was praised by General Montcalm. He was also present at the Battle of Sainte-Foy in 1760, serving under the Chevalier de Levis.
Following the war, Cook returned to Caughnawaga and married Marie-Charlotte. As he never fully accepted the British victory and found his homeland increasingly overrun by British colonists, he moved with his family to Akwesasne, a Mohawk village on the Quebec side of the St. Lawrence River. 
American Revolution.
Although the Mohawk and three other of the Iroquois nations sided with the British during the American Revolution, hoping to expel the colonists from their lands, Cook allied with the Thirteen Colonies, as did the Oneida and Tuscarora. As early as 1775, he offered his services to General George Washington. Cook was with Benedict Arnold on his expedition into Quebec, when he was already known as "Colonel Louis." Washington met again with Cook in 1776.
In New York, Louis Cook was present at the Battle of Oriskany, and participated in the Saratoga Campaign. He led a large body of Oneida warriors under General Robert Van Rensselaer. Following the Battle of Klock's Field, Cook forded a river in pursuit of Sir John Johnson while General Rensselaer delayed. Infuriated, Colonel Louis shook his sword at Rensselaer and accused him of being a Tory.
Cook was with the Continental Army at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777. In spring 1778, Peter Stephen DuPonceau wrote of meeting Cook, dressed in American regimentals, after hearing the officer singing a French aria. In March of that year, General Philip Schuyler sent Cook to destroy British ships at Niagara to prevent another Canadian expedition.
The nickname of "Colonel Louis" was made fact on June 15, 1779, when Cook received a commission from the Continental Congress as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Continental Army. This commission was the highest rank awarded to an American Indian during the Revolution, and is the only known Continental Army commission given to a man of known African descent. Colonel Louis was with Lieutenant-Colonel Marinus Willett at the Battle of Johnstown in 1781, one of the last North American battles of the Revolution.
During the war, Cook became a personal enemy of Captain Joseph Brant, a Mohawk who supported the British. When each returned to their homes after the war, their personal conflict divided the Mohawk nation and brought the Seven Nations of Canada and the Iroquois then at what would be the Six Nations Reserve to the brink of war.
Later life.
Cook settled in the area of Sterling, New York following the war. He became an influential adviser to the Oneida tribe because he could speak both French and English. 
While living at Onondaga Cook married Marguerite Thewanihattha. They had several children. 
Cook convinced the Oneida to lease their lands, using the example of the Mohawk tribe at Kahnawake. The Oneida leased nearly to Colonel John Livingston for 999 years. Conflicting claims were made on many of the Iroquois lands, and much of the land was lost to the state of New York because the Iroquois were forced to cede land, as allies of the defeated British. The Oneida named Cook and Peter Otsequette to negotiate with Governor George Clinton for a return of- or compensation for- their land. Governor Clinton made some minor concessions to the Oneida in the Treaty of Fort Schuyler, but generally did not yield much to the Oneida representatives. Today, Cook has been criticized for negotiating bad land deals for the Oneida. 
Despite his shortcomings in the Oneida land negotiations, between 1792 and 1796 Cook was also selected by the Seven Nations of Canada on six separate occasions to represent them in land negotiations with New York state. The negotiations were related to lands sold by the people of two villages, Grand River and Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, Ontario, who were led by Joseph Brant. The Mohawk peoples of Akwesasne and Kahnawake, two of the Seven Nations, denied that those villages had the right to sell what was common Mohawk land in New York. Ultimately, New York prevailed in keeping control of the land, and the division between Cook and Brant was deepened.
By 1789, Cook had settled at Akwesasne, where he became an influential chief. The Mohawk reserve eventually established there spans the US-Canadian border and the St. Lawrence River. He argued that the St. Regis Indians (as they were sometimes called) and the Seven Nations should remain neutral in the War of 1812 between the US and Great Britain. The United States forgot his earlier service and detained him at Fort Niagara until he produced his commission, as well as letters from George Washington. 
Although too elderly to participate, Cook followed the United States army into Canada during the war and was present at the Battle of Lundy's Lane. He was involved in a skirmish and fell from his horse. The injuries proved fatal; he died in the American camp in October 1814. Cook was given a military salute at his funeral, and was buried near Buffalo, New York.

Goldsborough (novel)

Goldsborough is a proletarian novel by the German-American writer Stefan Heym. 
It depicts a coal miners’ strike during 1949-1950 set in the fictional Goldsborough, Pennsylvania, a company town near Pittsburgh. The protagonist is Carlisle Kennedy, head of a large family and himself a miner. When the local union chief fails to take action against the company, Kennedy leads a wildcat pit strike. 
Stefan Heym, a refuge from Hitler’s Germany and a naturalized American, began this novel in the United States after doing site visits with coal miners in Western Pennsylvania, but McCarthyism drove him to East Germany, where he finished writing it in 1952. The book was written and first published in English, in Leipzig, and released by an American publisher a year later, as well as in a German translation.
Heym renounced his American citizenship in response to the beginning of the Korean War and lived in East Germany until his death.

New South Greenland

New South Greenland, sometimes known as Morrell's Land, was an appearance of land recorded by the American captain Benjamin Morrell of the schooner "Wasp" in , during a sealing and exploration voyage in the Weddell Sea area of Antarctica. Morrell provided precise coordinates and a description of a coastline which he claimed to have sailed along for more than . Because the Weddell Sea area was so little visited, and hard to navigate due to ice conditions, the alleged land was never properly investigated before its existence was emphatically disproved during Antarctic expeditions in the early 20th century.
At the time of Morrell's voyage, the geography of the then unnamed Weddell Sea and its surrounding coasts was almost entirely unknown, making the claimed sighting initially plausible. However, obvious errors in Morrell's voyage account, and his general reputation as a fabulist, created scepticism about the existence of this new land. In the German explorer Wilhelm Filchner searched for but found no traces of land, after his ship "Deutschland" became icebound in the Weddell Sea and drifted into the locality of Morrell's observation. A sounding of the sea bottom revealed more than of water, indicating no land in near proximity. Three years later, trapped in the same waters with his ship "Endurance", Ernest Shackleton was able by similar means to confirm the land's non-existence.
Various explanations for Morrell's error have been suggested, including intentional deception. However, Morrell describes his find briefly and prosaically, evidently seeking no personal credit or glory from the discovery. In his narrative he assigns the honour to his fellow sealing captain, Robert Johnson, for finding and naming the land two years earlier. Morrell may have been honestly mistaken, through miscalculation of his ship's position or by misremembering detail when writing the account after nine years. Alternatively, he may have made the common error of confusing distant icebergs with land, or been misled by the distorting effects of Antarctic mirage. In 1843 the distinguished British naval explorer James Clark Ross reported possible land in a position close to Morrell's; this land, too, would eventually be proven not to exist.
Voyage of the "Wasp", 1822–23.
First phase, June 1822 to March 1823.
In the early 19th century the geography of Antarctica was almost completely unknown, though occasional sightings of land had been recorded. In 1822 Benjamin Morrell, who had sailed to the South Sandwich Islands the previous year, was appointed commander of the schooner "Wasp" for a two-year voyage of sealing, trading and exploration in the Antarctic seas and the southern Pacific Ocean. In addition to his sealing duties Morrell had, as he put it, "discretionary powers to prosecute new discoveries." He proposed to use this discretion to investigate the Antarctic seas "and to ascertain the practicality ... of penetrating to the South Pole." This would be the first of four extended voyages that would keep Morrell at sea for most of the following eight years, although he would not revisit the Antarctic after the initial voyage.
"Wasp" sailed south from New York on 1822. She reached the Falkland Islands late in October, after which Morrell spent 16 days in fruitless searches for the nonexistent Aurora Islands, before heading for South Georgia, where the ship anchored on . In his account Morrell wrongly records the position of this anchorage, placing it in open sea about south-west of the island's coastline. "Wasp" subsequently headed eastwards to hunt for seals and, according to Morrell, reached the remote Bouvet Island on , finding this elusive island without apparent difficulty. Historian H.R. Mill notes that Morrell's description of the island's physical features fails to mention the island's most singular characteristic—it is covered by a permanent ice sheet. He then attempted to take the ship southwards but, reaching thick ice at around 60°S, turned northeast towards the Kerguelen Islands where he anchored on .
After several days of exploration and evidently profitable sealing, "Wasp" left the Kerguelens on 1823, sailing south and east to record her furthest eastern position at 64°52'S, 118°27'E on . From this point, according to his own account, Morrell decided to take advantage of strong easterly winds, and made a rapid passage westward back to the Greenwich meridian, 0°. His account is light on details, but indicates that a distance of more than was covered in 23 days. The credibility of this claim of such fast, direct travel in ice-infested waters has been widely disputed, particularly as Morrell quotes southerly latitudes during the voyage which later proved to be at least 100 miles inside the then undiscovered Antarctic continental mainland. On "Wasp" reached Candlemas Island in the South Sandwich Islands. After a few days spent in a search for fuel to feed the ship's stoves "Wasp" sailed southwards on , into the area later known as the Weddell Sea. Finding the sea remarkably free of ice, Morrell advanced to 70°14'S before turning north-westward on . This retreat, Morrell says, was due to the ship's lack of fuel; otherwise, he claims, in these open waters he could have taken the ship to 85°, or perhaps to the Pole itself. These words are very similar to those used by the British explorer James Weddell to describe his own experiences in the same area, a month earlier, which has led historians to suspect that Morrell may have plagiarised Weddell's experiences.
Sighting of land.
At 2 pm next day, 15 March, as "Wasp" cruised north-east in the sea that would later bear Weddell's name, Morrell records: "land was seen from the masthead, bearing west, distance 3 leagues" (about nine miles, 14 km). His account continues: "At half past we were close on with the body of land to which Captain Johnson had given the name of New South Greenland". Robert Johnson, a former captain of the "Wasp", had made an exploratory voyage along the western coast of the Antarctic peninsula in 1821, calling it "New South Greenland". Morrell's casual reference to Johnson indicates that he assumed the land he was now seeing was the east coast of the peninsula, the geographical character and dimensions of which were not then known (his actual position was about 14° east of the peninsula). Morrell describes seal hunting activities continuing along this putative coast during the remainder of the day. On the following morning sealing resumed as the ship moved slowly southward, and continued until Morrell called a halt "because of shortage of water and season far advanced". Mountains of snow, he observed, could be discerned about further south.
Morrell turned north from a position he calculated as 67°52'S, 48°11'W. Three days later, on , the ship passed what he took to be the northern cape of the land, at 62°41'S, 47°21'W. "This land abounds with oceanic birds of every description", wrote Morrell. He also records seeing 3,000 sea elephants. At 10 o'clock "Wasp" "bade farewell to the cheerless shores of New South Greenland"; there is no further mention of it in the long voyage account. "Wasp" sailed for Tierra del Fuego, then through the Magellan Strait into the Pacific Ocean, reaching Valparaiso, Chile, on 1823.
From the first navigations of the Southern Ocean in the 16th century, lands which subsequently proved to be nonexistent had from time to time been reported in these waters. Polar historian Robert Headland of the Scott Polar Research Institute has suggested various reasons for these false sightings, ranging from "too much rum" to deliberate hoaxes designed to lure rival ships away from good sealing grounds. Some may have been of large ice masses that were carrying rocks and other glacial debris—dirty ice can appear convincingly similar to land. It is also possible that some of these lands existed, but later became submerged after volcanic eruptions. Other sightings may have been of actual land, wrongly located through observational errors due to chronometer failure, adverse weather or simple incompetence.
Searches for Morrell's land.
Doubt was cast over the existence of New South Greenland when, in 1838, the French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville sailed over the position of Morrell's "north cape", but saw no indication of land. This evidence, and the general nature of Morrell's account—its obvious errors, and his reputation as a braggart "as great ... as any hero of autobiographical romance" in the words of British geographer Hugh Robert Mill, led many geographers thereafter to ignore his claims. This scepticism remained even after Sir James Clark Ross reported an appearance of land in 1843, not far from Morrell's alleged observation: Ross's sighting was occasionally proffered as supportive of Morrell's claim. There was no further penetration of the Weddell Sea until 1903, when William Speirs Bruce took "Scotia" to 74°1'S, but in a sector of the sea which did not bring him close to Morrell's or Ross's sightings. Bruce was, however, generally well-disposed towards Morrell, writing that his claims should not be rejected until absolutely disproved.
The first determined search for New South Greenland came during the Second German Antarctic Expedition, 1911–13, under Wilhelm Filchner. The expedition's ship, "Deutschland", had become trapped in heavy sea ice while attempting to establish a shore base at Vahsel Bay. Her subsequent north-westerly drift had, by mid-, brought her to a position east of Morrell's recorded sighting. Filchner left the ship on and, with two companions and sufficient provisions for three weeks, sledged westward across the sea ice in search of Morrell's land. Daylight was limited to two or three hours a day, and temperatures fell to −31 °F (−35 °C), making travel difficult. In these conditions the group covered , taking frequent sightings. They found no signs of land; a lead weight dropped through the ice reached a depth of before the line snapped, a depth which confirmed there was no land in the vicinity. Filchner concluded that what Morrell had seen had been a mirage.
On 17 August 1915 Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship "Endurance", trapped in the ice like "Deutschland" three years earlier, drifted to a point 10 miles west of Morrell's charted position. Here, a depth sounding recorded 1,676 fathoms (10,060 feet, 3,065 m), leading Shackleton to write: "I decided that Morrell Land must be added to the long list of Antarctic islands and continental coasts that have resolved themselves into icebergs". On a further sounding of 1,900 fathoms (11,400 feet, 3,500 m) gave Shackleton additional evidence of the non-existence of New South Greenland.
Although Filchner's and Shackleton's investigations and observations were accepted as conclusive proof that New South Greenland was a myth, there remained the question of Sir James Ross's reported appearance of land in a position around 65°S, 47°W. Ross's reputation was sufficient for this possibility to be taken seriously, and for his alleged sighting to be recorded on maps and Admiralty charts. In 1922 Frank Wild, leading the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition aboard "Quest" after Shackleton's death early in the expedition, investigated the location of Ross's sighting. Nothing was seen; prevented by ice conditions from reaching the exact spot, Wild took a sounding at 64°11'S, 46°4'W, which revealed of water. This showed that no land was near.
Opinions and theories.
According to W.J. Mills, Morrell had the reputation among his contemporaries as "the biggest liar in the Southern Ocean". Mills calls the westward journey from Morrell's claimed farthest east position "impossible ... unbelievably fast, quite apart from lying south of the coastline for much of the way". In search of an explanation Mills suggests that since Morrell's account was written nine years after the voyage he may not have had access to the ship's log, and hence may "have felt constrained to invent details that appeared plausible" in order to sustain his narrative. This would explain the profusion of positional and date errors.
Hugh Robert Mill, writing in 1905 before the non-existence of New South Greenland had been proved conclusively, refers to the sheer absurdity of some of the incidents described in Morrell's account, and concludes that because of Morrell's blunders, and his habit of incorporating the experiences of others into his story, all his claims must be treated as not proven. Nevertheless he concedes that "a man may be ignorant, boastful and obscure, and yet have done a solid piece of work". Canadian geographer Paul Simpson-Housley adopts a more sympathetic approach. Although dubious about much of Morrell's account, Simpson-Housley suggests that the speeds claimed for the western journey, though fast, are not impossible. He believes that the claimed farthest south in the Weddell Sea, queried by Mill, is entirely plausible, given that James Weddell had sailed four degrees further south just a month earlier.
Another inclined to defend Morrell's integrity is the writer Rupert Gould, who included a lengthy essay on New South Greenland in his collection "Enigmas", published in 1929. The assumption that the New South Greenland sighting was simply invented by Morrell is dismissed, primarily on the grounds of the very little weight given to the discovery in Morrell's 500-page account. Gould writes: "If Morrell wished to gain an undeserved reputation as an Antarctic explorer, one would think he could have gone a better way about it than to bury his "pièces justificatives", after he had forged them, in an undistinguished corner of so bulky a book." In the relatively few pages devoted to the Antarctic, Morrell's account of his discovery is brief and entirely matter-of-fact, crediting it to Captain Johnson two years earlier rather than to himself.
Gould also discusses the possibility that what Morrell sighted was indeed the eastern coast of Graham Land, the so-called "Foyn Coast", despite its being 14° further west from position of the New South Greenland sighting. In support, Gould asserts that the peninsula's eastern coast corresponds very closely with the stretch of coastline described by Morrell. This theory supposes that Morrell miscalculated the ship's position, perhaps because he lacked the chronometer necessary for proper navigational observation. In his account Morrell writes that he was "destitute of the various nautical and mathematical instruments", but other parts of his narrative make it clear that the occasional dead reckoning calculation was the exception to the norm. In any circumstances a longitudinal error of 14° is very large, and the additional distance of about to the Foyn coast seems too great to have been covered within the ten-day voyage from the South Sandwich Islands, where the ship's position is recorded accurately. Even so, Gould maintains that a "balance of evidence" shows that what Morrell saw was the Foyn coast.
Filchner's view that the supposed sighting of New South Greenland could be explained by a mirage is echoed by Simpson-Housley. He suggests that Morrell and his crew saw a superior mirage. One form of superior mirage, sometimes described as a Fata Morgana, distorts distant flat coastlines or ice edges both vertically and horizontally, so they can appear to have tall cliffs and other features such as high mountain peaks and valleys. In his expedition account "South", Shackleton gives a description of a Fata Morgana observed on 1915, coincidentally as his ship "Endurance" drifted close to the recorded position of New South Greenland: "The distant pack is thrown up into towering barrier-like cliffs, which are reflected in blue lakes and lanes of water at their base. Great white and golden cities of Oriental appearance at close intervals along these cliff-tops indicate distant bergs ... The lines rise and fall, tremble, dissipate, and reappear in an endless transformation scene".
Afterwards.
Morrell's four voyages finally ended on 1831, with his return to New York. He then wrote his "Narrative of Four Voyages", which was published the following year. He attempted to resume his seafaring career, seeking employment with the London-based shipping firm of Enderby Brothers, but his reputation had preceded him and he was rejected. Charles Enderby stated publicly that "he had heard so much of him that he did not think fit to enter into any engagement with him." Morrell also sought to join Dumont D'Urville's expedition to the Weddell Sea in 1837, but his services were again declined. He reportedly died in 1839, and is commemorated by Morrell Island, 59°27'S, 27°19'W, an alternative name for Thule Island in the Southern Thule sub-group of the South Sandwich Islands.

Rose Hill Manor

Rose Hill Manor is a historic home located at Frederick, Frederick County, Maryland. It is a -story brick house. A notable feature is the large two-story pedimented portico supported by fluted Doric columns on the first floor and Ionic columns on the balustraded second floor. It was the retirement home of Thomas Johnson (1732–1819), the first elected Governor of the State of Maryland and Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. It was built in the mid-1790s by his daughter and son-in-law.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.
Rose Hill Manor Park & Children's Museum.
Address: 1611 North Market Street, Frederick, Maryland 21701
Phone: (301)600-1650
The Mission of Rose Hill Manor Park and Museums is to preserve and present the living heritage of the property known as Rose Hill from 1746-1950. In a child-friendly, hands-on environment the museums present the daily life of Thomas Johnson, Maryland’s first Governor, and the individuals who lived on the property as well as the history of agriculture and transportation in Frederick County
History of the Property:
This land was a part of “Tasker’s Chance”, a 7,000-acre tract owned in 1726 by Benjamin Tasker. In 1737 a group of German farmers took out an option on the entire tract of land described as containing some of the area’s finest potential home-sites. Unable to raise the sum of money Tasker had asked for the land, the small farmers, all of them poor, went to Annapolis lawyer and land speculator Daniel Dulany for financing. Agreeing to undertake the financial arrangements Dulany bought the option, then the tract itself, selling small lots to the enterprising Germans. One 225 acre section was bought in 1746 for 20 pounds by a German, Hans Peter Hoffman. He called the tract “Rose Garden.” His descendants subsequently sold his whole plantation to Maryland’ first elected Governor, Thomas Johnson in 1778 for 4,000 pounds, current money of Maryland at that time.
The 225 acre tract was given by Governor Thomas Johnson to his eldest daughter, Ann Jennings Johnson as a wedding gift on the eve of her marriage to Major John Colin Graham. (Following the death of his wife, Governor Johnson spent the last 25 years of his life living as a guest of his daughter Ann at Rose Hill.)
Under Graham’s hand, Rose Hill’s acreage doubled. By the mid-1820’s Graham was having problems making ends meet and he sold off some of his slaves, 100 acres of Rose Hill and 300 acres of a farm located 5 miles to the west of Rose Hill. His will instructed his wife to sell the estate after his death, pay debts and keep what was left.
In 1833, Captain John McPherson who married Mrs. Graham’s niece purchased Rose Hill.
He never occupied the mansion, thus protecting Mrs. Graham’s right to remain there until her death in 1837.
In 1837, Rose Hill was sold to Colonel William Slater, an Irish immigrant and wealthy merchant from Philadelphia and Baltimore.
In 1843, Colonel Slater sold the estate to his brother George.
In 1845 the property was sold to John J. Willson (married to Anna Tyler) who spent a considerable amount of money on renovating it.
In 1853 the estate was sold to David Ogle Thomas, a direct descendant of one of the original purchasers of Tasker’s Chance. Upon his death, the property was left to his wife who sold it in 1894 and moved to Baltimore.
The estate was on the market for twelve years and unoccupied, when the agent Noel Cramer bought it and lived in it until the mid 1920’s. He gave it to his son, James, who thought it was too far from town and it was left vacant for twenty-five years, except in 1930 when it served as a hotel and restaurant.
In the 1950’s the Cramer’s returned and restored it, but the owner died in 1957.
In 1968, the Board of County Commissioners of Frederick County purchased the remaining 43 acre site for $401,400 of Federal, State and County funds. The house is curently owned by the county and is operated as part of Rose Hill Manor Park & Children's Museum. 
In 1972 a unique ‘see and touch’ children’s museum was opened in the mansion as a joint venture with the Frederick County Parks Commission and the Board of Education.
Description of the Property:
Thought to have been built by local craftsman the Rose Hill manor house construction began shortly after the wedding of Ann Jennings Johnson and Major John Colin Graham. The construction of the 2-1/2 story, white frame, brick wall mansion stretched over an eight year period from laying the foundation to its occupation around 1798.
The house rests on a low fieldstone foundation with brick cellar walls. The front façade faces the south and is laid in Flemish bond and all other is in common bond. A nineteenth century galleried portico with white columns fronts the mansion. 
Rose Hill Mansion is approached by a driveway off an entrance road adjoining the northern boundary of Governor Thomas Johnson High School from the west side of North Market Street.
The portico forms two porches: One is on the ground floor at the entrance level with four Doric columns supporting a structure between the columns and a roof consisting of an architrave, frieze and elaborate, carved cornice. The other is above on the second floor with four Ionic columns supporting the pediment lighted by a lunette window. On either side of the large pediment, the roof is pierced by a dormer window with round-arch and a parapet. A similar pediment with a lunette window also graces the rear elevation of the mansion. A flush chimney rises from each gable end of the main block. The mansion’s design reflects the late Georgian style of Tidewater, Maryland and the Greek Revival style.
At the north end of the wide entrance hall is a broad staircase that rises to a landing from which a window overlooks the north garden. The stair continues up in units of six steps to the third story. The upper rails and banisters are light in weight and plain.
Off the east side of the entrance hall is a twenty-six foot square, high ceiling drawing room containing six windows, a mantel piece and a large chandelier with crystal prisms.
To the west of the entrance hall is a dining room of the same generous dimensions which recalls an age of good living and entertainment.
The second floor center hall south door opens directly onto the upper level of the front porch that faces the high school.
On either side of the upper hall are two large bedrooms with fireplaces and two smaller bedrooms that have had a section partitioned off for a bathroom. 
A kitchen with a fireplace and beehive oven is adjoined to the western side of the mansion with a flush brick chimney rising from the west gable end. There is a service entrance at the front and a veranda on the back overlooking formal gardens. There are several small rooms over the kitchen.
Windows on the first floor are nine-over-nine sash and on the second floor are nine-over-six sash all with colonial shutters having widely spaced louvers with hand wrought hardware and headed by jack arches.
The attic contains two large finished rooms. It is lighted by nine-over-six sash pane round arched dormer windows headed by local style stepped gables on the front and rear.
A formal, native fieldstone walled garden and orchard with old trees occupies about a half an acre on the northern side of the mansion. The garden is accented by an attractive, two-tier cast iron fountain with the pedestal and bowls decorated by Greek acanthus leaves. This was topped by a “putti” embracing a swan. 
Other buildings include a brick smokehouse with hour glass design louvers, a hipped roof summer kitchen, ice house, old tool shed, an 1835 log cabin, a new building known as the The Robert H. Renneberger Carriage Museum features a collection of restored carriages and sleighs, a carriage repair shop and blacksmith shop, three exhibit buildings housing steam engines, antique farm machinery and a livestock barn, the Farm Museum displays include tractors, 19th and early 20th century agriculture tools and equipment, farm family life, a carpentry shop and a broom shop.

Presentation director

A Presentation Director is a person who works in the broadcast television industry. They are responsible for the playout of all television programmes, commercials and other material (known as interstitials).
History.
The nature of the job has changed dramatically as technology has progressed. Until recently a presentation director worked in a single presentation suite and was responsible for the manual broadcast of a single television channel, usually using video tape and a vision mixer. 
With new computer automation and the rise of multi-channel satellite tv networks, a modern presentation director oversees the transmission of dozens of channels from a single suite. Sometimes a second suite (a "break-out" suite) may be employed for live television events such as sport or news.
Examples of computer automation solutions include Harris Corporation's AirClient and Pro-Bel's Morpheus.

Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology

Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology (GERAM) is a generalised Enterprise Architecture framework for enterprise integration and business process engineering. It identifies the set of components recommended for use in enterprise engineering. 
This framework is developed in the 1990s by an IFAC/IFIP Task Force on Architectures for Enterprise Integration. The development starting with the evaluation of existing frameworks for enterprise integration which was developed into an overall definition of a socalled "generalised architecture", which was named GERAM for "Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology". 
Overview.
Enterprise modelling is seen as the major item in enterprise engineering and integration. Therefore, both the methodologies and the corresponding languages will be implemented in enterprise modelling tools (GEMT) which will support the enterprise integration process. Ontological theories (OT), generic enterprise models (GEMs) and generic modules (GMs) will support the modelling process by providing means for more efficient modelling. 
The modelling process will result in an enterprise model (EM) which represents all or part of the enterprise operation. These models will allow simulation of operational alternatives and thereby their evaluation leading to the optimum structure, contents and behaviour of the enterprise operation. GERAM provides a generic description of all the elements recommended in enterprise engineering and integration. 
Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology (GERAM) is an enterprise-reference architecture that models the whole life history of an enterprise integration project from its initial concept in the eyes of the entrepreneurs who initially developed it, through its definition, functional design or specification, detailed design, physical implementation or construction, and finally operation to obsolescence. The architecture aims to be a relatively simple framework upon which all the functions and activities involved in the aforementioned phases of the life of the enterprise-integration project can be mapped. It also will permit the tools used by the investigators or practitioners at each phase to be indicated. The architecture defined will apply to projects, products, and processes; as well as to enterprises.
History.
Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology (GERAM) is developed in the 1990s by an IFAC/IFIP Task Force on Architectures for Enterprise Integration with Peter Bernus, James G. Nell and others. The IFAC/IFIP Task Force on Architectures for Enterprise Integration was establishment in 1990 and had studied enterprise-reference architectures ever since. 
In its work the Task Force has established the requirements to be satisfied by candidate enterprise-reference architectures and their associated methodologies to fulfill the needs of industry for such aids to enterprise integration. The result has been called GERAM, for "Generalized Enterprise-Reference Architecture and Methodology", by the Task Force. The Task Force has shown that such an architecture is feasible and that several architectures presently available in the literature can already or potentially can fulfil such requirements.
The development of enterprise-reference architecture has evolved from the development of Design Methodology for Advanced Manufacturing Systems in the 1980s, such as CIMOSA, the Open System Architecture for CIM. The GERAM framework was first published by Peter Bernus and Laszlo Nemes in 1994.
GERAM Topics.
GERAM Components.
The Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology (GERAM) consists of a series of eight main components, as shown in figure 1: 
Generic Enterprise Reference Architecture.
"Generic Enterprise Reference Architecture" (GERA) defines the enterprise related generic concepts recommended for use in enterprise integration projects. These concepts include life cycle; enterprise entity types, enterprise modelling with business process modelling; integrated model representation in different model views and modelling languages for different users of the enterprise architecture (business users, system designers, IT modelling specialists, among others). 
Life-Cycle Concept.
Provides for the identification of the life-cycle phases for any enterprise entity from entity conception to its final end. The Figure 2: GERA Life-Cycle Concept, shows the GERA life cycle phases of enterprise entities. A total of 9 life cycle phases has been defined. 
Enterprise Entity Type Concept.
Identifies entity types to be used in enterprise engineering and enterprise integration. Adopting a recursive view of integration altogether five entity types with their associated life-cycles can be identified. The recursiveness of the first four entity types can be demonstrated by identifying the role of the different entities, their products and the relations between them. Figure 3: GERA Enterprise Entity Concept, shows the GERA life cycle phases of enterprise entities. A total of 9 life cycle phases has been defined. 
Figure 3 represents the chain of enterprise entity developments. The type 1 entity will always start creation of any lower level entity by identifying goal, scope and objectives for the particular entity. Development and implementation of a new enterprise entity (or new business unit) will then be done by a type 2 entity; whereas a type 3 entity will be responsible for developing and manufacturing a new product (type 4 entity). With the possible exception of the type 1 entity all enterprise entities will have an associated entity-life cycle. However, it is always the operational phase of the entity-life cycle in which the lower entity is defined, created, developed and built. The operation itself is supported by an associated methodology for enterprise engineering, enterprise operation, product development and production support
Figure 3 also shows the life cycle of the methodology (type 5 entity) and the process model developed during the early life cycle phases of the methodology. However, there must be a clear distinction between the life cycle of the methodology with its different phases and its process model. The latter is used to support the operational phase of a particular enterprise entity. The operational relations of the different entity types are also shown in Figure 4: GERA Enterprise Entity Concept (Type 3), which demonstrates the contributions of the different entities to the type 3 entity life-cycle phases. The manufacturing entity itself produces the enterprise product in the course of its operation phase (type 3 entity).
Enterprise Modelling concept.
Enterprise Modelling concept provides process models of enterprise operations. Process oriented modelling allows to represent the operation of enterprise entities and entity types in all its aspects: functional, behaviour, information, resources and organisation. Models which can be used for decision support by evaluating operational alternatives or for model driven operation control and monitoring. 
To hide complexity of the resulting model it will be presented to the user in different sub-sets (views). This view concept is shown in Figure 5 : GERA Generic Reference Architecture Concept. It is applicable during all phases of the life cycle. Please note that the views will be generated from the underlying integrated model and any model manipulation. That means any change being done in one particular view will be reflected in all relevant aspects of the model. The GERA life cycle model has defined four different views: function, information, decision/organisation and resource/structure. Other views may be defined if needed and supported by the modelling tool. In addition, the life cycle model of GERA provides for two different categories of modelling: operation control and customer-service related. 
Modelling Language concept.
Modelling languages increase the efficiency of enterprise modelling. In addition they allow a common representation of the enterprise operation. Modelling languages have to accommodate different users of enterprise models; for example, business users, system designers, and IT-modelling specialists. 
Modelling languages have to support the modelling of all entity types across all phases of their respective life cycles. In addition, modelling languages have to provide generic constructs as well as macro constructs (GEMs) built from generic ones. The latter will further enhance modelling productivity. 
Figure 5 shows the reference architecture for those enterprise entity life cycle phases which require generic constructs. The partial level shows the place of the GEMs in the reference architecture. The particular level indicates the life cycle phases of the enterprise entity itself.
Generic Enterprise Engineering Methodologies.
"Generic Enterprise engineering methodologies" (GEEM) describe the process of enterprise integration and, according to the GERAM framework (Figure 1), will result in a model of the enterprise operation. The methodologies will guide the user in the engineering task of enterprise modelling and integration. Different methodologies may exist which will guide the user through the different tasks required in the integration process. 
Enterprise-engineering methodologies should orient themselves on the life-cycle concept identified in GERA and should support the different life cycle phases shown in Figure 2. The enterprise integration process itself is usually directed towards the enterprise entity type 3 (see above) operation and carried out as an enterprise engineering task by an enterprise entity type 2 (Figures 2 and 4). The integration task may start at any relevant engineering phase (indicated in Figure 6: Enterprise Engineering and the Life-Cycle Concept.) of the entity life cycle and may employ any of those phases. Therefore the processes relating to the different phases of enterprise engineering should be independent of each other to support different sequences of engineering tasks. 
Enterprise engineering methodologies may be described in terms of process models with detailed instruction for each step of the integration process. This allows not only a very good representation of the methodology for its understanding, but provides for identification of information to be used and produced, resources needed and relevant responsibilities to be assigned for the integration process. Process representation of methodologies should employ the relevant modelling language discussed below. 
Generic Enterprise-Modelling Language.
"Generic enterprise modelling languages" (GEML) define generic constructs (building blocks) for enterprise modelling. Generic constructs which represent the different elements of the operation improve both modelling efficiency and model understanding. These constructs have to be adapted to the different needs of people creating and using enterprise models. Therefore different languages may exist which accommodate different users (e.g. business users, system designers, IT modelling specialists, others). 
Modelling the enterprise operation means to describe its processes and the necessary information, resources and organisational aspects. Therefore modelling languages have to provide constructs capable of capturing the semantics of enterprise operations. This is especially important if enterprise models are to support the enterprise operation itself. 
Model-based decision support and model-driven operation control and monitoring require modelling constructs which are supporting the end users and which represent the operational processes according to the users perception. 
Modelling languages increase the efficiency of enterprise modelling. In addition they allow a common representation of the enterprise operation. Modelling languages have to support the modelling of all entity types across all phases of their respective life cycles. In addition, modelling languages have to provide generic constructs as well as macro constructs (GEMs) build from generic ones. The latter will further enhance modelling productivity. 
Generic Enterprise-Modelling Tool.
"Generic enterprise modelling tools" (GEMT) define the generic implementation of the enterprise integration methodologies and modelling languages and other support for creation and use of enterprise models. Modelling tools should provide user guidance for both the modelling process itself and for the operational use of the models. Therefore enterprise modelling tools designs have to encompass not only the modelling methodology, but should provide model enactment capability for simulation of operational processes as well. The latter should also include analysis and evaluation capabilities for the simulation results. 
Enterprise Models.
"Enterprise models" (EMs) represent the enterprise operation mostly in the form of business processes. However, in certain cases other representations may be suitable as well. Business processes will be represented using the generic modelling-language constructs defined above for the relevant engineering methodology. Enterprise operations are usually rather complex and therefore difficult to understand if all relevant aspects of the operation are represented in a common model. To reduce the model complexity for the user, different views should be provided which allow the users only to see the aspect of concern. 
Ontological Theories.
"Ontological theories" (OT) formalise the most generic aspects of enterprise related concepts in terms of essential properties and axioms. Ontological theories may be considered as 'meta-models' since they consider facts and rules about the facts and rules of the enterprise and its models. 
Generic Enterprise Models.
"Generic enterprise models" (GEMs) identify reference models (partial models) which capture concepts common to many enterprises. GEMs will be used in enterprise modelling to increase modelling process efficiency. 
Generic Modules.
"Generic Modules" (GMs) identify generally applicable products to be employed in enterprise integration (e.g. tools, integrating infrastructures, others.).

Ann Morrison

Ann Morrison (born April 9, 1956) is an American actress, best known for her Broadway debut as Mary Flynn in the Stephen Sondheim/George Furth musical, "Merrily We Roll Along" directed by Harold Prince for which she won the 1982 Theatre World Award. Off-Broadway she played Lizzie in the highly acclaimed Polly Pen/Peggy Harmon musical "Goblin Market" which garnered her a 1986 Drama Desk Award Nomination as Best Actress in a Musical and a Best Plays Theatrical Yearbook Citation as Best Actress in a Musical. 
Early life.
Born in Sioux City, Iowa, her family moved to the Chicago area when she was seven. Her family co-created a summer theater company called The Banner Players performing on the shores of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin when Ann was a teenager. This experience taught her true cooperation as she would star in "Gigi" one week and work on the back stage crew the next. Her high school plays and musicals gave her an outlet during the school year and her parents would continually have her join their programs and performances at George Williams College where they both were teachers. With graduation she won a scholarship to a new musical theater training program at Boston Conservatory of Music.
Career.
Morrison left Boston Conservatory after the first semester and attended the HB Studios in New York, then spent time in San Francisco before arriving back in Chicago to work in theater there. While attending jazz clubs with her father on one occasion she discovered "The Benny Kim Show", a 7-member family band created by Korean Big Band leader Benny Kim. She got to know them after following their performances of Big Band music, Country/Western, Disco, Pop, Rock and Show tunes. They asked her to join them as MC and trombone player (she had to learn since everyone played an instrument). She donned a black afro wig and the costume for the group: a 1970s white jump suit with glitter and fringe. They played nightclubs and Holiday Inns in and around Chicago for the next year and as MC she learned to "play a crowd". This ended when while on stage it was announced that she would marry the second eldest son and left the show.
Morrison auditioned for and was admitted to an apprentice program that Burt Reynolds was sponsoring at his Jupiter, Florida dinner theater. Besides singing in the lobby before performances the 10 member group would work back stage on the crew. This gave Ann the chance to watch and get to know the TV and film stars (Tyne Daly, Sally Field, and Kate Jackson) some of whom were making a stage debut. She was given an opportunity when it was decided she would play the Girl in "The Fantastiks".
At the end of the year-long program each apprentice earned their Actors' Equity Association card by signing a contract for "The Sound Of Music" (Ann played Sister Margaretta), the last show of the season. Prior to that they each appeared on "Dinah!" when Dinah Shore brought her daytime TV talk show to the stage of the Burt Reynolds Theater for one week. Morrison sang ""I Can Cook Too"" wearing a 1940s style costume with hat and gloves. After wowing Dinah and the live audience, Burt Reynolds declared that Morrison was the one to watch and that we would probably see her on Broadway in a year or so.
Having Earned her AEA card, Morrison moved to New York where within a month was cast in a new Waldman/Uhry musical "Dream Time". Regional productions of "Grease", "Babes In Arms" and "Godspell" followed. Then she was cast in a role that would change her life. After seeing her play silent film actress Mabel Normand in a new musical "Keystone" at the GEVA Theatre in Rochester, NY, famed choreographer Ron Field told her she should play Mary Flynn in the new Sondheim/Furth musical "Merrily We Roll Along". All of the roles had been cast but Harold Prince was still looking for "Mary". She was flown to New York for a first audition for the Casting Director, then returned to GEVA to finish her run. Back in New York, on her 25th birthday she was asked to sing for Harold Prince and Stephen Sondheim. She recalls in interviews that Prince walked down to the stage and offered the role of "Mary". They would begin rehearsals 6 months later.
Much has been written about what happened when "Merrily We Roll Along" opened on Broadway. During 6 weeks of previews (52 performances) James Weisenbach was replaced by Jim Walton and Larry Fuller took over as choreographer when Ron Field was replaced. Morrison claims that there were changes in every performance until 3 days before opening. The morning after the show closed, the cast went into RCA studios to record the Original Broadway Cast recording.
The next spring, Morrison received a Theatre World Award for her performance as Mary Flynn. Together with former "Merrily" cast mate Jason Alexander, she replaced the original cast of "Forbidden Broadway" at Palsson's in New York. She impersonated Mary Martin, Julie Andrews, Carol Channing and appeared on the television show "Merv!" as Patti LuPone in "Evita". While playing in "Forbidden Broadway" she Taped "Keystone" for broadcast on New Jersey Network, reprising her role as Mabel Normand.
American Producer Louis Busch Hager wanted to cast an American Actress in the title role of a new musical version of "Peg O' My Heart" set for the West End in London. After auditions in New York, he flew Morrison along with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Christine Ebersole to London. Morrison won the role and back in New York began a series of backers auditions while working with composer David Heneker ("Half A Sixpence"). Heneker completed the song "Manhattan Hometown" while he and Morrison were staying at Hager's Cooperstown, NY home. "Peg" as it was now titled, began rehearsals in London for an April 1984 opening. She was welcomed by her British cast of West End stars Sian Phillips, Edward Duke, Patricia Michael, in a small production (9 characters, no chorus) giving them a modest run through the summer. They made a cast recording before Morrison returned to New York.
In the years that followed, Morrison created the role of Lizzie in the highly acclaimed Polly Pen/Peggy Harmon musical "Goblin Market" first Off-Off Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre, then moving to Circle In The Square Downtown Off Broadway. This earned her a Best Actress Drama Desk Award nomination. With Teri Klausner she made an Original Cast recording. In her new home of Los Angeles she played Faye Apple in the West Coast Premiere of "Anyone Can Whistle" and won a Dramalogue Award for "Blame It On The Movies II". In regional theaters across the country she has starred in "Peter Pan", "Guys and Dolls", "Little Shop Of Horrors", "Cabaret", "On A Clear Day", "Oliver!", "Good News", musical versions of "A Midsummer Night's dream", "Twelfth Night" and "Love's Labours Lost", "Can Can", "Sunset Boulevard, "On The Verge" and "Shadowlands". She has done countless cabaret performances and concerts, most notably the S.T.A.G.E. benefits for APLA, the "Merrily We Roll Along" Reunion Concert in 2002 and the Stephen Sondheim birthday celebration, "Children And Art", at the New Amsterdam Theater.
In 2006 Harold Prince secured her for the workshop and several backers auditions for the new musical "Lovemusik", to play Lotte Lenya opposite Michael Cerveris as Kurt Weill. When the show opened on Broadway, the role went to Donna Murphy and a small role was added for Ann who understudied and performed as Lotte Lenya on May 13, 2007.

Manifesto of the 343

The Manifesto of the 343 (French: "le manifeste des 343"), was a declaration that was signed by 343 women admitting to having had an abortion, thereby exposing themselves to criminal prosecution. The manifesto appeared in the French magazine "Le Nouvel Observateur" on April 5, 1971.
It was also known as the "Manifesto of the 343 Sluts" or the "Manifesto of the 343 Bitches" ("le manifeste des 343 salopes").
The text.
The text of the manifesto was written by Simone de Beauvoir. It began (translated here into English):
One million women in France have an abortion every year.
Condemned to secrecy, they have them in dangerous conditions when this procedure, performed under medical supervision, is one of the simplest.
These women are veiled in silence.
I declare that I am one of them. I have had an abortion.
Just as we demand free access to birth control, we demand the freedom to have an abortion.
Impact.
The week after the manifesto appeared, the front page of the satirical weekly "Charlie Hebdo" carried a drawing attacking male politicians with the question "Qui a engrossé les 343 salopes du manifeste sur l'avortement?" ("Who got the 343 sluts from the abortion manifesto pregnant?") This drawing by Cabu gave the manifesto its nickname.
It was the inspiration for a February 3, 1973, manifesto by 331 doctors declaring their support for abortion rights:
We want freedom of abortion. It is entirely the woman's decision. We reject any entity that forces her to defend herself, perpetuates an atmosphere of guilt, and allows underground abortions to persist ...
It contributed above all to the adoption, in December 1974–January 1975, of the "Veil law", named for Health Minister Simone Veil, that repealed the penalty for voluntarily terminating a pregnancy during the first ten weeks (later extended to twelve weeks).

Murat Gasaev

Murat Gasaev (also transliterated as Murad Gasayev), an ethnic Chechen, was a refugee in Spain from the Russia's Republic of Ingushetia. In December 2008, he was extradited to Russia despite protests by human rights organizations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. It was feared that Gasaev might be at risk of torture and ill-treatment, as well as the denial of a fair trial due to the potential use of evidence extracted under torture in Russia. 
The Russia's extradition request appeared to have been based on statements by a prisoner in Russian custody who accused Gasaev of being a participant in the events of June 2004 (the 2004 Nazran raid on government buildings in Ingushetia) while under interrogation by the Federal Security Service (FSB). That detainee, Idris Matiev, later retracted his statement, alleging that he had been subjected to beatings, torture with electric shocks and threats against his family. Gasaev has claimed that he was detained in Ingushetia in August 2004 by five masked officers, who took him to the central office of the FSB in Ingushetia, where he was tortured and questioned about the attack. He was not charged and was released after three days of torture. 
Gasaev fled Russia and eventually sought refuge in Spain in 2005. However, his claim of asylum was rejected on the basis of "confidential information provided by the Spanish authorities." In December 2006, he was arrested as a suspected "militant" by the Spanish authorities in Valencia at the request of Russia. The Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture is not known to have been consulted about the "diplomatic assurances" given by the Russian public prosecutor until after the Spanish court had approved the extradition request. According to experts, "with or without guarantees, a Chechen who is accused of killing police officers does not stay alive for long in a Russian prison." 
On December 31, 2008, Gasaev was sent to Russia without any anti-torture guarantees in the first such extradition from a European country. Amnesty International said the extradition violated Spain’s obligations under international human rights law, including the United Nations Convention Against Torture. 
On June 30, 2009, the senior Russian investigator in charge of the case ruled that all charges should be dropped against Gasayev, whose alibi was corroborated by five witnesses. He was freed on August 28, after 10 months in detention in Russia. "It’s a great relief that Gasayev is out of detention, but he should never have been there in the first place," Tanya Lokshina, HRW's deputy Moscow director said.

1981 Antwerp bombing

On October 20, 1981, a truck bomb exploded outside a Portuguese Jewish synagogue in the centre of Antwerp, Belgium. Three people were killed and 106 wounded. 
The explosion blew in the doors and stained-glass windows of the synagogue and smashed storefronts and windows for blocks around. 
The bomb had been concealed in a delivery truck parked illegally overnight with one wheel removed, as if it had broken down. After the blast, only the vehicle's axles, some glass and other debris remained.
The attack took place on a Tuesday morning in the diamond district of Antwerp, shortly before Simchat Torah religious services were to begin. It followed by one year the 1980 Paris synagogue bombing, which took place on the eve of Simchat Torah.
The bombing was condemned as "diabolically wicked" by Belgian prime minister Mark Eyskens.

Breakthrough! (album)

Breakthrough! is an album by the Cedar Walton/Hank Mobley Quintet recorded on February 22, 1972, originally released on the short-lived Cobblestone label and rereleased on the Muse label. It features performances by Hank Mobley and Cedar Walton with Charles Davis, Sam Jones and Billy Higgins and would be Mobley's final studio recording before he retired due to lung problems.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states "As strong as pianist Cedar Walton plays on his session, the main honors are taken by two of his sidemen. Tenor-saxophonist Hank Mobley, whose career was about to go into a complete eclipse, is in brilliant form, showing how much he had grown since his earlier days. Baritonist Charles Davis, who too often through the years has been used as merely a section player, keeps up with Mobley and engages in a particularly memorable tradeoff on the lengthy title cut. Mobley is well-showcased on "Summertime," Davis switches successfully to soprano on "Early Morning Stroll," and Walton (with the trio) somehow turns the "Theme From Love Story" into jazz. Highly recommended".

1980 Paris synagogue bombing

On October 3, 1980, the eve of Simchat Torah, a bomb went off outside the Union Libérale Israélite de France synagogue on Rue Copernic, Paris. Four people were killed and more than forty injured. The bomb, consisting of about of Semtex explosives, had been hidden in the saddlebags of a motorcycle parked outside the synagogue. It went off at 6:38 PM, shortly before the end of services. None of those killed were members of the congregation.
Aftermath and investigation.
After the attack then-Prime Minister Raymond Barre sparked allegations of anti-semitism by describing the bombing as “a heinous act against Jews in a synagogue that struck four innocent Frenchmen crossing the street”—a comment which seemed to imply that the synagogue's members were neither innocent nor truly French. 
French police initially suspected that the attack had been carried out by neo-Nazis, but later attributed it to the PFLP or one of its offshoots. In 2008 France began seeking the extradition of Hassan Diab, a Lebanese-born Canadian citizen, in connection with the bombing. 
Subsequent attacks.
The bombing was the first of a string of attacks against Jews in Europe. On August 29, 1981, a synagogue in Vienna, Austria, was attacked by Palestinian gunmen, who killed two people and wounded 30 in the 1981 Vienna synagogue attack. On October 20, 1981, also the eve of Simchat Torah, three people were killed and 94 injured in a truck bomb attack outside a synagogue in the diamond-trading centre of Antwerp, Belgium in the 1981 Antwerp bombing.

Maronites

The Maronites ( ", "; ", ") are an ethnoreligious group in the Levant. They derive their name from the Syriac saint Maron whose followers moved to Mount Lebanon from northern Syria establishing the nucleus of the Maronite Church.
Maronites were able to maintain an independent status in Mount Lebanon and its coastline after the Arab Islamic conquest, maintaining their religion and language there until the 13th century. Remnants of their language exist in Cyprus and formerly in some secluded mountain villages, which have since adopted Arabic due to government standardization. The Maronite Church is in communion with the Church of Rome.
The Ottoman Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate and later the Republic of Lebanon were created under the auspice of European powers with the Maronites as their main ethnic component. Mass emigration to the Americas at the outset of the 20th century and the Lebanese Civil War between 1975 and 1990 greatly decreased their numbers in the Levant. Maronites today form more than one quarter of the total population in the country of Lebanon. With only two exceptions, all Lebanese and Greater Lebanese presidents have been Maronites. The tradition persists as part of the Lebanese Confessionalist system, also meaning that the Prime Minister has historically been a Sunni Muslim.
History.
A number of Maronite historians claim that their people were the descendants of the Canaanites or Phoenicians, or also the Mardaites, residents in parts of Caliphate province of Bilad al-Sham, who kept their identity under both Byzantine and Arab authorities. The reason for their adoption of the name is disputed and historians disagree whether it refers to Mar Maron, a 4th-century Syriac Christian saint, or to John Maron, the first bishop of Lebanon.
Population.
The Maronite population is estimated to be about 3 million, according to the Catholic Near East Welfare Association. Originating in the northern Levant, it has largely dispersed into diaspora over the last two centuries, now having large communities in the Americas. Significant Maronite communities still reside in the Middle East – most notably in Lebanon and Syria and to a lesser degree in Cyprus, Israel, Jordan and Egypt.
Lebanon.
According to a 2007 report, there are approximately 930,000 Maronites in Lebanon, where they constitute up to 22% of the population. Under the terms of an agreement between the various political and religious leaders of Lebanon, the president of the country must be a Maronite.
Syria.
Syrian Maronites total 51,000, belonging to the archdioceses of Aleppo and Damascus and the Diocese of Latakia.
Cyprus.
There is also a Maronite community in Cyprus, which speaks Cypriot Maronite Arabic. They are a recognized religious minority on the island and the community elects a representative to sit in the House of Representatives to voice their interests. They are descended from those Maronites who accompanied the crusaders, although more recent Lebanese immigrants are often included as part of the community, which now numbers 10,000.
Israel.
A Maronite population numbering some 7,500, exists in northern Israel, composed of the long existing community in Jish area, and recent fugitives (mostly former South Lebanon Army militia members and their families), who fled South Lebanon to Galilee in April–May 2000.
Diaspora.
Americas.
The two residing eparchies in the United States have issued their own "Maronite Census", designed to estimate how many Maronites reside in the United States. Many Maronites have been assimilated into Western Catholicism as there were no Maronite parishes or priests available. The "Maronite Census" was designed to locate these Maronites. There are also eparchies at São Paulo in Brazil; as well as in Argentina, Canada and Mexico.
Australia.
Significant Maronite communities also reside in Australia, many with origins in traders who settled during the 19th Century.
France.
An important Maronite community exists in France.
South Africa.
The history of the Lebanese Community goes back to the late 19th century, when the first immigrants arrived in Johannesburg, the biggest city in the Transvaal coming from Sebhel, Mesyara, Becharre, Hadath El-Joube, Maghdoushe and other places. It is recorded that in the year 1896 the first Maronite and Lebanese immigrants arrived in Durban, Cape Town, and Mozambique, and congregated around their local Catholic Churches. The majority of the Lebanese immigrants were Maronite and being concerned about keeping their Maronite faith alive in a new country, they wrote to the Maronite Patriarch, insisting on the need for a Maronite priest to come to South Africa to continue their tradition and the Maronite Rite. In 1905, Patriarch Elias El-Hayek sent Fr. Emmanuel El-Fadle to South Africa from Kfarhata–Elzawye, North Lebanon. A historical year for the entire Maronite Community in South Africa – Fr. Emmanuel El-Fadle was the first Maronite priest to walk on South African soil. Having spent time as a student in Rome and Paris, he began serving the South African community on both spiritual and social levels. He converted a building in Johannesburg into a church and residence. He left South Africa after 2 years. Fr. El-Fadle never returned to Lebanon; he was a passenger on board the ship SS "Waratah", which disappeared in July 1909 en route from Durban to Cape Town.
In 1910, Fr. Ashkar arrived to build a church and a home for the priests. The Patriarch, then sent another priest to assist – Fr. Wakim Estphan. Fr. Ashkar returned to Lebanon and retired in 1928. The mission was then handed over to The Congregation of Maronite Lebanese Missionaries. Fr. Yousef Juan, who was appointed as a temporary visitor, received instruction from the Patriarch and the General Superior for Fr. Yousef Moubarak to succeed him in serving the South African Maronite Community. The Congregation of Maronite Lebanese Missionaries have since served in South Africa among other countries and continue in their mission in serving and assisting in the Maronite Rite.
Identity.
The followers of the Maronite Church form a part of the Syriac Christians and belong to the West Syriac Rite. The Maronite Syriac Church of Antioch traces its foundation to Maron, an early 5th-century Syriac monk venerated as a saint. Before the conquest by Arabian Muslims reached Lebanon, the Lebanese people, including those who would become Muslim and the majority who would remain Christian, spoke a dialect of Aramaic called Syriac. Syriac remains the liturgical language of the Maronite Church.
Phoenicianism.
Phoenicianism as an alternative to acceptance of an Arab identity on the part of Lebanese Christians has developed into an integrated ideology led by key thinkers, but there are a few who have stood out more than others: Charles Corm, Michel Chiha, and Said Aql in their promotion of Phoenicianism. In post civil-war Lebanon since the Taif agreement, politically Phoenicianism is restricted to a small group.
Among leaders of the movement Etienne Saqr, Said Akl, Charles Malik, Camille Chamoun, and Bachir Gemayel have been notable names, some going as far as voicing anti-Arab views. In his book the Israeli writer Mordechai Nisan, who at times met with some of them during the war, quoted Said Akl, a famous Lebanese poet and philosopher, as saying; 
In opposition to such views, Arabism was affirmed at the March 1936 Congress of the Coast and Four Districts, when the Muslim leadership at the conference made the declaration that Lebanon was an Arab country, indistinguishable from its Arab neighbors. In the April 1936 Beirut municipal elections, Christian and Muslim politicians were divided along Phoenician and Arab lines in the matter of whether the Lebanese coast should be claimed by Syria or given to Lebanon, increasing the already mounting tensions between the two communities. Phoenicianism is still disputed by many Arabist scholars who have on occasion tried to convince its adherents to abandon their claims as false and to embrace and accept the Arab identity instead. This conflict of ideas of identity is believed to be one of the pivotal disputes between the Muslim and Christian populations of Lebanon and what mainly divides the country to the detriment of national unity. In general it appears that Muslims focus more on the Arab identity of Lebanese history and culture whereas the older Christian communities focus on the pre-Arabization, pre-Islamic and non-Arab elements of the Lebanese identity and rather refrain from the Arab characterization.
Support for Lebanese nationalism.
Lebanese Christians are known to be specifically linked to the root of Lebanese Nationalism and opposition to Pan-Arabism in Lebanon, this being the case during 1958 Lebanon crisis. When Muslim Arab nationalists backed by Gamel Abdel Nasser tried to overthrow the then Christian dominated government in power, due to displeasure at the government's "pro-western" policies and their lack of commitment and duty to the so-called "Arab brotherhood" by preferring keep Lebanon away from the Arab League and the political confrontations of the Middle East. A more hard-nosed nationalism among some Christian leaders, who saw Lebanese nationalism more in terms of its confessional roots and failed to be carried away by Chiha's vision, clung to a more security-minded view of Lebanon. They regarded the national project as mainly a program for the security of Christians and a bulwark against threats from Muslims and their hinterland.
The right-wing yet secular Guardians of the Cedars, with its exiled Leader and founder Etienne Saqr (also the father of singers Karol Sakr and Pascale Sakr) took no sectarian stance and even had Muslim members who joined in their radical stance against Arabism and Palestinian forces in Lebanon.
Saqr summarized his party's view on the Arab Identity on their official ideological manifesto by stating;
On an Al Jazeera special dedicated to the political Christian clans of Lebanon and their struggle for power in the 2009 election entitled, "Lebanon: The Family Business" the issue of identity was brought up on several occasions, by various politicians including Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, who claimed that all Lebanese lack somewhat of a real identity and the country is yet to discover one everybody could agree on. Sami Gemayel, of the Gemayel clan and son of former president Amin Gemayel, stated he did not consider himself an Arab but instead identified himself as a Syriac, going on to explain that to him and many Lebanese the "acceptance" of Lebanon's "Arab identity" according to the Taef Agreement wasn't something that they "accepted" but instead were forced into signing through pressure.
In a speech in 2009 to a crowd of Christian Kataeb supporters Gemayel declared that he felt there was importance in Christians in Lebanon finding an identity and went on to state what he finds identification with as a Lebanese Christian, concluding with a purposeful exclusion of Arabism in the segment. The speech met with an applause afterward from the audience;
Etienne Sakr, of the Guardians of the Cedars Lebanese party, in an interview responded "We are not Arabs" to an interview question about the Guardians of the Cedars' ideology of Lebanon being Lebanese. He continued by talking about how describing Lebanon as being not Arab was a crime in present day Lebanon, about the Lebanese civil war, and about Arabism as being first step towards Islamism, claiming that "the Arabs want to annex Lebanon" and in order to do this "to push the Christians out (out of Lebanon)", this being "the plan since 1975", among other issues.
Embrace of Arab identity.
During a final session of the Lebanese Parliament, a Marada Maronite MP states his identity as an Arab: "I, the Maronite Christian Lebanese Arab, grandson of Patriarch Estefan Doueihy, declare my pride to be a part of our people’s resistance in the South. Can one renounce what guarantees his rights?"
Maronite Deacon Soubhi Makhoul, administrator for the Maronite Exarchate in Jerusalem, has said "The Maronites are Arabs, we are part of the Arab world. And although it’s important to revive our language and maintain our heritage, the church is very outspoken against the campaign of these people.” 
Culture.
Religion.
The Maronites belong to the Maronite Syriac Church of Antioch, which is an Eastern Catholic Syriac Church that had affirmed its communion with Rome since 1180 A.D., although the official view of the Church is that it had never accepted either the Monophysitic views held by their Syriac neighbours, which were condemned in the Council of Chalcedon, or the failed compromise doctrine of Monothelitism (the latter claim being found in contemporary sources). The Maronite Patriarch is traditionally seated in Bkerke north of Beirut.
Names.
Modern Maronites often adopt French or other Western European given names (with biblical origins) for their children, including Michel, Marc, Marie, Georges, Carole, Charles, Antoine, Joseph and Pierre.
Given names of Arabic origins identical with those of their Muslim neighbors are also common, such as Khalil, Toufic, Jamil, Samir, Salim or Hisham. Other common names are strictly Christian and are Aramaic, or Arabic, forms of biblical, Hebrew, or Greek Christian names, such as Antun (Anthony or Antonios), Butros (Peter), Boulos (Paul), Semaan or Shamaoun (Simon or Simeon), Jergyes (George), Elie (Ilyas or Elias), Iskander (Alexander) and Beshara (literally Good News in reference to the Gospel). Other common names are Sarkis (Sergius) and Bakhos (Bacchus), while others are common both among Christians and Muslims, such as Youssef (Joseph) or Ibrahim (Abraham).
Some Maronite Christians are named in honour of Maronite saints, including the Aramaic names Maroun (after their patron saint, Maron), Nimtullah, Charbel and Rafqa (Rebecca).
Persecution & struggle.
Maronite Christians felt a sense of alienation and exclusion as a result of Pan Arabism in Lebanon. Part of its historic suffering is the Damour massacre by the PLO, which was a response to the Karantina massacre by Phalangists. Until recently, the Cyprus Maronites battle to preserve their ancestral language.
The Maronite monks maintain that Lebanon is synonymous with Maronite history and ethos; that its Maronitism antedates the Arab conquest of Syria and Lebanon and that Arabism is only a historical accident. The Maronites also felt mass persecution under the Ottoman Turks, who massacred and mistreated Maronites for their faith, disallowing them from owning horses and forcing them to wear only black clothing. The Druze also persecuted the Maronites for their identity, and massacred in excess of 50,000 of them in the mid-1800s. Yet the Maronites later prevailed, and ushered Lebanon into its golden age, which was followed by the sectarian conflict that resulted in the Lebanese Civil War

Pilkington (ancient township)

Pilkington was a township in the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham, hundred of Salford and county of Lancashire, in northern England.
History.
Manor.
The Pilkington family can be traced from about 1200. The senior line acquired the manor of Bury when Roger Pilkington who died in about 1347, married Alice Bury. Roger Pilkington and his father, also Roger, were present with Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322. The older Roger was imprisoned and fined, his son secured pardon by undertaking military service abroad. His son Sir Roger Pilkington (1325–1407) served under Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster in 1355, and under John of Gaunt in 1359–60 and 1369. The Pilkingtons built a house with a moat between 1359 and 1400 and were granted a licence to crenellate the manor house at Bury in 1469 when it became known as Bury Castle.
Roger's son Sir John Pilkington (d. 1421) was granted custody of the manors of Prestwich and Alkrington. He married Margaret (d. 1436), heir of John Verdon of Brixworth, Northamptonshire, soon after the death of her first husband, Hugh Bradshaw of Leigh. Margaret's son from her first marriage, William Bradshaw, died in 1415, leaving a daughter, Elizabeth. In 1430 Margaret settled the manors of her inheritance which included Stagenhoe in Hertfordshire, Clipston, Northamptonshire and Brixworth in Northamptonshire, and Bressingham in Norfolk, on her Pilkington sons, John, Edmund (d. about 1451), and Robert (d. 1457). Four years after the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1489, Sir Thomas Pilkington of Pilkington lost his estates by Royal Attainder to the Stanleys, who received the title 'Earl of Derby'. Sir Thomas Pilkington was granted Royal pardon in 1508
Governance.
Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Pilkington formed part of the Bury Poor Law Union. In 1866, a Local board of health was established for the Whitefield area of Pilkington, which had begun to urbanise and expand into a town in its own right. In 1885 part of Pilkington was merged into the Municipal Borough of Bury. Following the Local Government Act 1894, the township of Pilkington was dissolved and its area divided between the then County Borough of Bury, Radcliffe Urban District, Whitefield Urban District, Outwood township and Unsworth township.
Geography.
It was bounded on two sides, the southwest and north, by the River Irwell, and encompassed the settlements of Blackford Bridge, Cinder Hill, Hollins, Besses o' th' Barn, Outwood, Ringley, Stand, Unsworth, and Whitefield. The township was abolished in 1894.

C. R. Johnson

Charles Russell Johnson III ( October 8, 1983 – February 24, 2010) was a professional skier and a pioneer in the freeskiing movement. He became a top competitor and a favorite in ski films and was known for his progression, fearlessness, and passion for skiing. Johnson died in 2010 in a ski accident.
Childhood.
C.R. Johnson was born and raised in Truckee, Lake Tahoe California. He grew up skiing Squaw Valley Resort, a world-class ski area that is known for its extreme terrain. At Squaw Valley, Johnson spent his time lapping the terrain park and charging difficult chutes and bowls. Johnson quickly developed a large range of tricks and excellent big mountain skills. In addition to skiing, Johnson enjoyed surfing, fly-fishing, traveling, and spending time with close friends and family.
Career.
In 1999, Johnson emerged on the freeskiing scene when he successfully landed a 1440. The skiing community quickly recognized Johnson as a talented young star who could help progress free skiing. Johnson was a fearless skier willing to try any tricks and ski any backcountry lines. His passion for skiing and dedication to improve propelled him to become one of the best free skiers in the world. In 2001, Johnson placed first at the Core Games quarter pipe in Japan and podiumed at the Big Air Winter X Games in Mount Snow, Vermont. The following year at the 2002 Winter X Games, Johnson won silver in slopestyle. In addition to his medals, ESPN Action Sports nominated Johnson for Male Skier of the Year.< In 2003, Johnson won bronze at Winter X Games Superpipe. If it was not for him crashing on the lip of the pipe, Johnson might have gotten Gold over Candide Thovex. Regardless of the results, Johnson exemplified the future of half-pipe skiing by launching 20 feet above the pipe’s walls and landing technical tricks with many spins and intricate grabs. During this period, Johnson also spent time filming and producing ski segments with action sport producers like Matchstick Productions, Poor Boyz Productions, and Teton Gravity Research. From 1999 until 2004, Johnson had a significant role in many ski films. Some of his most notable segments were in films called “Front Line,” “Focused,” and “WSK 106.” 
Injury.
On December 8, 2005 Johnson was filming his latest movie, Show and Prove when he suffered a life threatening injury. He was skiing at Brighton Ski Resort in Utah on a powder day, when he and Kye Peterson, along with the snowboarders Zach Siebert & Tommi Ylianttila, launched off natural features under the Millicent chair, one after another. Johnson being the first one to descend stopped after landing an air to collect his gear, when Kye Peterson struck him right below his helmet. The impact knocked Johnson unconscious for about three minutes. When help arrived he was immediately sedated and flown to the University of Utah Hospital. There he was put into intensive care but his recovery was questionable. For 10 days, Johnson remained in a medically induced coma. However on December 18, 2005, Johnson opened his eyes halfway. Eight days later Johnson began whispering, eating, and moving both sides of his body. He was then moved out of the critical care unit to a neural rehabilitation unit where he began speech, physical, and occupational therapy. After being hospitalized for 34 days, Johnson was finally able to return home.
Comeback.
Johnson was determined to start skiing again. He was not going to let his life-threatening injury prevent him from doing what he loved. In 2007, Johnson began the ski season with the attitude and mindset that he would return to his original form. That November and December he spent six weeks in Colorado training half-pipe. Unfortunately, Johnson had a hard time progressing and decided he was not strong enough to compete. He then spent time traveling to different competitions, heli-skiing in British Columbia, and filming with Matchstick Productions. At the end of the year, Johnson had overcome many mental hurdles and reestablished a new direction for his ski career. He decided to concentrate on filming and progressing his backcountry skiing. In 2008 and 2009, Johnson continued to travel and film with several ski production companies. He continued to improve and in 2010 Johnson placed third at the Red Bull Line Catcher event in France.
Death.
On February 24, 2010, at age 26, Johnson died skiing at Squaw Valley Ski Resort in the Light Towers area. He had chosen an extreme rocky line to go down the mountain and caught an edge on an exposed rock which caused him to fall . Medical assistance arrived several minutes after the incident but pronounced him dead on the scene.
His death had significant impact throughout the freeskiing, mountain sport, and especially in the Squaw Valley community which has lost several high profile athletes near the end of the decade. A funeral service was held March 5, 2010.

Kiket Island

Kiket Island is a small islet in Washington, co-owned by the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission and the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community. Located less than four miles northwest of the town of LaConner in Skagit County, Washington, Kiket is connected to Fidalgo Island by a tombolo, over which runs an access road. Thus, Kiket Island is not what most people would consider an island. 
Hope Island lies to the south of Kiket; Skagit Island only a few hundred feet to the southwest. These islands can be said to divide Skagit Bay from Similk Bay. The shoreline of Kiket Island and vicinity has been called one of the best-studied areas of coastal Washington. Ecological studies were made in the last decades of the twentieth century, when the site was considered for a nuclear power plant. 
In 1969, Seattle City Light and Snohomish County PUD considered building a $250 million 1,100 MW nuclear power plant on the island. By 1972, the plan for the nuclear plant was dropped due to environmental concerns. Seattle City Light and Snohomish County PUD later sold the property in 1980.
On June 23, 2010, a joint ownership agreement was signed by the state Parks and Recreation Commission and the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community. Both Kiket and tiny Flagstaff Island (connected to Kiket by another tombolo) are included in the agreement, and are now part of Deception Pass State Park. The partners and the Trust for Public Land gathered grants and donations from a range of sources to purchase the $14 million property from a private owner. Formal public access to and use at the Kukutali Preserve is still to be determined by an as yet uncompleted management plan. In the interim, public access to the island is provided by weekly guided tours conducted by Washington State Parks representatives. People who wish to visit the island should contact staff at Deception Pass State Park to make arrangements for the Saturday day tours. 
In January 2011, a man by the name of Michael Oakes was convicted in the slaying of a celebrity dog trainer, who had once used the island for his dog training business. Michael Oakes, in the trial documents, said that he dumped the body into the Swinomish Channel, as he was afraid "police would catch him". The body was never found, and Oakes was sentenced to 320 months in prison. 
As part of the acquisition process, wildlife surveys were conducted in the winter of 2008–2009.

1st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Heavy Artillery

The 1st Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteer Heavy Artillery was a unit that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. It was originally raise as the 14th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry.
History.
14th Mass Infantry.
The 14th Massachusetts Infantry began its recruitment in spring 1861, most of its members coming from Essex County. They were mustered in on 5 July 1861, and left the state on 7 August for Washington, DC, where it would serve in its defenses until the end of the year. Colonel William B Greene, a West Point graduate and a veteran of the Florida Indian Wars, resigned in October, and was replaced as leader of the unit by Col Thomas R Tannatt, who transferred over from the 16th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry.
Reorganization as artillery.
On 1 January 1862, the regiment was reorganized and became a heavy artillery regiment. As artillery units required more men, fifty additional soldiers were added to each company and two additional ones were formed. They served in several military garrisons around Washington, including forts Woodbury, Tillinghast, Craig, Albany, and DeKalb.
Early skirmishes.
On 26 August 1862, the regiment was sent to the front, and was present at the Second Battle of Bull Run, though it did not participate. During the Union retreat from the battlefield, Confederate cavalry overtook the 1st Massachusetts, capturing the surgical staff, the wagoners, and others. The doctors were quickly released, while the others were later paroled. 
A battalion of two companies were detached (two more joined a month or two later) on 27 September 1862 and sent to Maryland Heights, where they were to serve until December 1863. When the Union army abandoned its position at Winchester, VA in June 1863, Company I stayed behind to destroy the guns and ammunition, and 44 men were captured on 10 June. At this time, Company H was covering the army's retreat from Harpers Ferry.
First engagement.
On 17 May 1864, many heavy artillery regiments filled in as infantry units and joined the Army of the Potomac as part of Grant's 1864 campaign. In their first real engagement as a regiment, they engaged Ewell's Division at Harris Farm, on the Fredericksburg Road near Spotsylvania, VA on 19 May 1864. In this battle, they lost 55 killed, 312 wounded, and 27 missing. In reserve during the Battle of North Anna on 23–26 May 1864, losing only 1 killed, they moved on to Cold Harbor, losing two members during the trench warfare there from 4–12 June.
Siege of Petersburg.
The regiment took part in the assault on Petersburg on the 16 June 1864, and lost 25 killed and 132 wounded. They remained as part of the siege of the city until April 1865. During this time, they were also involved in the Battle of Globe Tavern (or the 2nd Battle of Weldon Railroad), when 185 men were captured when a Confederate offensive flanked the division, and the Battle of Hatcher's Run.
Lee's surrender.
Following Lee's surrender in April 1865, the 1st Massachusetts Heavy Artillery returned to Washington, DC and stationed the forts until they were mustered out in August. They returned to Boston on the 20th, and were encamped at Gallop's Island until the 25th, when they were paid and discharged.
Complement.
Through its four years of service, the regiment had a total of 2552 soldiers in its ranks, consisting of 24 field officers and staff, 111 line officers, and 2417 enlisted men.
Losses.
A total of 486 officers and men were lost, 215 of them killed or died of wounds, 115 died by disease or accident, 156 died as prisoners, and four dead listed as MIA.

Chu 13

CHU 13 medium is a culture medium used in microbiology for the growth of certain algal species, first published by S.P. Chu in 1942. It is used as growth medium for the biofuel candidate alga "Botryococcus braunii".
CHU 13 includes essential minerals and trace elements that are required by algae for growth, but does not include a carbon source and so is only appropriate for growth of phototrophs. It can be prepared as either a liquid medium or as an agar medium.
The remaining volume is pure, de-ionized water.
Because it is difficult to weigh out some of the trace minerals, it is advisable to create a mixture of all components at a large concentration, such as a thousand times these measures, and then mix with the appropriate amount of (pure, de-ionized) water. Correct pH to 7.5, and then autoclave.

<doc id="20764707" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20764707" title="Jean Malouel">
Jean Malouel

Jean Malouel, or Jan Maelwael in his native Dutch, ( 1365 – 1415) was a Netherlandish artist, sometimes classified as French, who was the court painter of Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy and his successor John the Fearless, working in the International Gothic style.
Documented life.
He was presumably born in Nijmegen, then in the Duchy of Guelders, which was bought by Philip the Bold in 1473, and is in the modern Netherlands. He probably trained there in the workshop of his father, the artist Willem Maelwael (his uncle was also an artist), and is recorded as an artist in 1382. He was the uncle of the famous manuscript illuminators, the three Limbourg brothers, whom he introduced to Philip's service around 1400. Malouel also worked as an illuminator, but seems mostly to have produced larger works.
Malouel is recorded as working in Paris painting armorial decorations on cloth (probably for banners) for Isabelle of Bavaria, Queen of France, in 1396–97, but by August 1397 he was in Dijon, the capital of the Duchy of Burgundy, where he succeeded Jean de Beaumetz (d. 1396) to the position of court painter to Philip, with the rank of valet de chambre. He retained these positions until his death, with a salary higher than that of Beaumetz or the sculptor Claus Sluter, and lived in Dijon. In 1405, soon after the death of Philip, he returned to Nijmegen to marry Heilwig van Redinchaven, bringing her back to Dijon. Another visit of over two months was recorded in 1413. In 1415 he died in Dijon, leaving Heilwig and four children. She received a pension from the Duke, and returned to Nijmegen, where she became involved in lengthy litigation over Malouel's estate there.
Attributed works.
Among a number of other commissions, many for decorative painting in the palaces, Malouel is recorded as receiving in 1398 the wood for five altarpiece panels for the Chartreuse of Champmol, Philip's new dynastic burial place near Dijon, as well as painting the Well of Moses there, sculpted by Claus Sluter, the base of which survives with some of its colouring. From 1401, Herman of Cologne, perhaps a specialist gilder, is recorded as Malouel's assistant, or perhaps foreman of a number of apprentices. Painting the "Well", and gilding all the upper parts, was a large job, on which they were occupied between 1401 and 1404. Malouel also painted Philip's tomb at Champmol, when the sculptors finally finished it after Sluter's death.
Malouel's "oeuvre" on panel remains controversial; the most generally accepted painting of his to survive is the "Pietà" tondo in the Louvre, the first true tondo of the Renaissance, though this is not accepted by Châtelet. This has Philip's coat of arms painted on the back, so should predate his death in 1404, and the "unusual iconography of the piece clearly links it to ", which was dedicated to the Holy Trinity, who all appear. The style of the work mixes Northern and Sienese elements, in a fashion characteristic of the International Gothic court art of the period. Although painted in the traditional tempera, the work uses transparent glazes in a way that was to be greatly developed in the work of Jan van Eyck after Malouel's death. Another of Phillip's Netherlandish artists, Melchior Broederlam, was already producing works partly in oil paint for Champmol.
The large (162 x 211 cm) altarpiece, also in the Louvre, of the "Martyrdom of St Denis with the Trinity" (or "The Last Communion and Martyrdom of Saint Denis"), also from Champmol, may have been begun by Malouel but completed by Henri Bellechose (his only known work), after Malouel's death. The ducal accounts record the provision of pigments (but not gold) to Bellechose to complete ("parfaire" = "perfect") a "painting of the life of St Denis", known to have been a subject of Malouel's, and some see a difference in style among the figures, while others do not. Snyder and Châtelet support Malouel's participation, but this is disputed, the case against being set out in an article of 1961 by Nicole Reynaud (in French). For Châtelet the St Denis altarpiece and the large tondo in the Louvre are two of the five altarpieces commissioned in 1398. Bellechose, who is not documented before Malouel's death, succeeded him as "valet" and court painter; Châtelet suggests he may have been in his workshop for years, and suggests he was responsible for the large tondo over ten years earlier, thus reversing the traditional attributions for these two famous works.
Malouel is also believed to have been the originator of a portrait image of Philip of about 1400 which survives only in versions believed to be later. He is recorded as working on a portrait of John the Fearless for the King of Portugal in 1413, and there were also portraits of Philip and John in the choir at Champmol (as we know from when Philip the Good ordered one of him to be added). A later version in the Musée Condé in Chantilly has been suggested as a copy of the Malouel image type of John. A large Madonna and Child, unearthed in 1960 in Berlin and now on loan to the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, has also been attributed to Malouel, as has another in the Louvre. It is believed the Berlin picture was one wing of a diptych opposite a portrait of John the Fearless, which would be the first known example of this format, later very common in Netherlandish painting. It was perhaps also for Champmol.
A number of other works are, or have been, attributed to Malouel or his workshop, including a smaller "Pietà" tondo in the Louvre, the "Antwerp-Baltimore polytych", also sometimes associated with Melchior Broederlam, and a damaged "Entombment of Christ" in Troyes.

Aïn El Turk

Ain el-Turck (arabic : عين الترك ) (literally "Fountain of the Turks") is the capital of Ain el-Turck District Located about fifteen kilometers from Oran, which contains nine municipalities. It now host an important seaside resort.
It also gives its name to one of the beaches in the region of Oran.
History.
Centuries ago, Ain el Turk was a plain called El Eurfa which extends from "St Roch" till "Les Andalouses".
Over the centuries, the population of El Eurfa plain (known later as Ain el Turck) has significantly increased. Two types of people lived there and cohabited : 
There were nomadic people who practice transhumance, wandering between the plains of E"l Eurfa, Boutlelis" and "Messreghinn", except in some special cases they did not go beyond the Sabkha in the South and the forest Madagh in the West, These nomadic tribes lived together and traded with sedentary or sedentarized tribes who practiced agriculture and beekeeping around Ain el Turck. These sedentary people sold their products at Mers el-Kebir and Oran, they also sold their products to nomadic tribes, but most of the time they swapped their products with sheep as they supply them with meat and wool.
General Aspect of the city in 1831.
Seaway and Roads.
In 1831, the area where the village would be built was a kind of a cul-de-sac from the only major road, which was rather a road that connected les Andalouse and Mers-el-Kebir and Oran via Bousfer called ""la Route des Crêtes"" which was very rocky and took new directions at Ain Khadija (later, the road was named 'Ploteau road'), joining Ain el Turck at the small village "Naqous", so named in Arabic because of the bells of the first church in the area "St. Anthony of Padua" (the word 'Naqous' means bell, in Arabic).
However, there were many other ways relied the village to St Roch, Cape Falcon, Coralès, to Les-Andalouses, the Daya and Bousfer.
Seaway has been used to link the city with Oran and Mers-el-Kebir, as there were links between these 2 cities when not at war, we know only that Turkish troops used the sea when coming to pick up the taxes
Water Sources.
There was in the plain of what will become Ain el Turck at least eight sources of water:
Ecology.
Apart from some woods and groves located down the hills, vegetation was predominantly dwarf palms (Duma), Alfa tufts, some diss, lentisk (especially at the dunes), juniper, thorns, herbs, agave, Reeds and a multitude of flowers and plants which were used as forage.
Forest trees especially pine and cedar are common south of the village down the mountain.
Indigenous people cultivated fruit trees such as almond, fig, the Jujubie, and vine also
But the most widespread plant was the pear used as a hedge of protection that had the triple advantage
You could find edible plants as a type of wild green asparagus, beautiful sea that was called "the wild white beans", chestnuts, the fennel, chicory, watercress.
There are also many mushrooms but they are not consumed (according to botanists, we could count on more than 30 species of which at least a dozen were edible)

Larry Cretul

Larry Cretul is a Florida real estate broker, Republican politician, and Speaker of the House of Representatives of the State of Florida. He represents House District 22, based in Ocala.
Cretul was subsequently elected Speaker Pro Tempore of the State House on November 18, 2008. On January 30, 2009, Speaker Ray Sansom announced he was "recusing" himself from his duties as Speaker due to a scandal over accepting an unadvertised job at Northwest Florida State College. Under the rule allowing him to recuse himself, Sansom named Cretul acting Speaker until Sansom could return. Sansom and Cretul are roommates in Tallahassee while the state House is in session.
However, on February 2, just minutes before the Republican caucus was due to oust him, Sansom resigned as House Republican leader, a post which automatically made him Speaker. Cretul was unanimously elected his successor, and was named Speaker at the start of the legislative session on March 3.
Representative Cretul was born on January 18, 1948 in Trenton, Michigan. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1967 to 1971, including a tour aboard "USS Forrestal". He moved to Florida in 1971. He attended Lawrence Technological University. He was elected to the Marion County Commission in 1994 and was re-elected 1998. He was first elected to the Florida House in 2002, and subsequently re-elected to three more terms. He is married to Lana J. Delves of Wyandotte, Michigan and they have two children, Brian and Scott.

Maria Teresa Felicitas d'Este

Maria Teresa Felicitas d'Este (October 6, 1726 – April 30, 1754) was born a princess of Modena and was by marriage the Duchess of Penthièvre. She was the mother-in-law of Philippe Égalité and thus the grandmother to the future Louis-Philippe of France.
Life.
Born in Emilia-Romagna in Modena, she was the daughter of Francesco III, Duke of Modena and his wife, the French princess Charlotte Aglaé d'Orléans. Her mother was a granddaughter of Louis XIV of France by a mistress.
One of nine children, she was the first daughter of the family. Her parents' marriage was not happy, and her mother eventually returned to France to live. The duchess took up residence in the Luxembourg Palace in Paris with the permission of Louis XV. It was while her mother was in France that a marriage was arranged between Maria Teresa Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, duc de Penthièvre.
Marriage.
Penthièvre was Maria Teresa's mother's first cousin. Charlotte Aglaé's mother was the sister of the duke's father, Louis-Alexandre Count of Toulouse. The young duke had inherited a vast fortune when his father died in 1737.
A proxy wedding ceremony took place in Modena. It was followed on 29 December 1744 by another ceremony at the Palace of Versailles. According to contemporaries, the marriage between the duke and his wife, now known officially as S.A.S., the "duchesse de Penthièvre", was a very happy one. It produced many children:
Descendants.
Only two of the Penthièvre children survived into adulthood. Marie Thérèse died at the Château de Rambouillet after giving birth to Louis Marie Félicité de Bourbon, who died soon afterwards. Originally buried in the chapel at Rambouillet, after the Bourbon Restauration in the early 19th century, she was later moved to the Chapelle royale de Dreux by her daughter.

Lowboy (trailer)

A lowboy (low loader in British English, low-bed in western Canada and South Africa or float in Australia) is a semi-trailer with two drops in deck height: one right after the gooseneck and one right before the wheels. This allows the deck to be extremely low compared with other trailers. It offers the ability to carry legal loads up to tall, which other trailers cannot. Lowboys are used to haul heavy equipment such as bulldozers, industrial equipment etc.
Another term is Flatbed trailer according to TecDic
History.
The first lowboy trailer was invented in the 1920s; it featured a riveted gooseneck and solid rubber tires. The first detachable gooseneck trailer, referred to as an RGN (Removable goose neck), was invented in 1958.
Types.
The lowboy trailer comes in several types, for a wide range of tasks. Some types are:

Arnold Tremere, Ph.D. (April 14, 1941 – October 26, 2008) was appointed as the Canadian International Grains Institute first director of Feed and Technology from May 1982 to October 1989, and subsequently was promoted to the position of Executive Director, the highest non-partisan position within the field of Agriculture in the Canadian government. The major defining events during his period as Director included the advent of North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA in 1989 and signing of the agreement in 1994. New technologies in farm equipment and grain handling, including GPS (global positioning systems) and the introduction of "Super-Elevators", dramatically changed the day to day experience of Canadian grain producers. Most Canadian agricultural producers were now diversifying away from the traditional crops of wheat, oats and barely to include a much higher percentage of oilseed and specialty crops. These changes called for an expansion of the services and technical areas of support including the addition of the Test Bakery to the infrastructure of C.I.G.I.
Biography.
Early life.
Dr. Tremere was born in Shaunavon, Saskatchewan and raised on the Les Tremere family homestead located in Scotsguard, Saskatchewan. Leslie Albert Tremere was born in Boston, Mass. on March 11, 1898 and Ruth was born in Esmond, North Dakota on June 6, 1910. His father's side, the Les Tremere family, is one of only 52 related Tremere families in North America. Tremere families originate from a line in Lanviet England. His mother's family was Swedish from the region near Algaras. He attended school in Austinville, Scotsguard and graduated from Shaunavon High School. Arnold Tremere married Marcella, also of Shaunavon, SK on August 7, 1962. He attended the University of Saskatchewan (U of S) where he attained his Bachelor of Science in Agriculture in 1962 with Distinction and Master of Science Degree in 1964. While in attendance at the U of S he received the National Research Council Fellowship, two National Research Council Awards and the Agriculture Foundation Scholarship. He was awarded his Ph.D. in 1968 from Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.
Nutritionist.
In his early career, Dr. Tremere was employed as a Nutritionist and Director of Nutrition and Research in the Agriculture division at Maple Leaf Mills in Toronto for 12 years. He subsequently was the General Manager of Maple Leaf Mills, Western Region, for three years. Following this period in industry, Tremere took his first position with the Canadian government in 1982 as the first director of the Feed and Technology division. In 1989 he became Director of the Canadian International Grains Institute until 2002.
Director.
Dr. Tremere, was appointed as the Canadian International Grains Institute First Director of Feed and Technology from May 1982 to October 1989, and subsequently was promoted to the position of Executive Director, the highest non-partisan position within the field of Agriculture in the Canadian government. He took over the position from Dennis Stephens. Tremere held this position from 1989 until his retirement in 2002. Barry Senft assumed the role of Executive Director with C.I.G.I. in 2002.
In his capacity as Director, Tremere represented the Canadian Grain Industry's educational and support services to 70 countries in Analytical Services, Baking Technology, Biofuel Technology, Feed Technology, Milling Technology, Noodle and Asian products, Pasta technology, Pulse processing and specialty mill.
Tremere's time as Director was particularly temultuous. The major defining events during his period as Director included the advent of NAFTA in 1989 and signing of the agreement in 1994. New technologies in farm equipment and grain handling, including GPS (global positioning systems) and the introduction of "Super-Elevators", dramatically changed the day to day experience of Canadian grain producers. In the face of great challenges to preserve their way of life, many Canadian agriculture producers picketed and protested any and all governmental sites where business related to agriculture was conducted at the Federal level including C.I.G.I headquarters in downtown Winnipeg, MB. In the early nineteen nineties, a rift was formed between the usually amicable American and Canadian agriculture sectors. The level of Canadian grain that was exported to the US suggested the possibility of an unfair trading advantage to the benefit of the Canadian farmers, a claim that later was shown be to unsubstantiated. By 2002, the face of Canadian agriculture had changed considerably from what had existed in the 1980s. Most Canadian agricultural producers were now diversifying away from the traditional crops of wheat, oats and barely to include a much higher percentage of oilseed and specialty crops. These changes called for an expansion of the services and technical areas of support at C.I.G.I. Specifically, in the area of technical services and support a new emphasis had been placed on understanding the consumer needs of the Asian market leading to many large scale tours in Western Canada offered and coordinated, under Tremere's direction, by "the Institute" for Asian agriculture representatives as well as the addition of the instant noodle manufacturing capacity at the C.I.G.I. site located in Winnipeg, MB.
Tremere retired to Medicine Hat, Alberta Canada, as a consultant for Stiltscorp, where he remained until his death in October 2008.

Richard Clarke Cabot

Richard Clarke Cabot (May 21, 1868 – May 7, 1939) was an American physician who advanced clinical hematology, was an innovator in teaching methods, and was a pioneer in social work.
Early life and education.
Richard Clarke Cabot was born May 21, 1868, in Brookline, Massachusetts. His paternal grandfather Samuel Cabot became a sailor at age 19 and married Elizabeth Perkins, daughter of a very successful Boston trader. Samuel later took over the running of the firm. His son, James Cabot, studied philosophy in Europe and taught it at Harvard. He also trained as a lawyer and biographer, and was a friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson.
Personal life.
He married Elizabeth, and both held Transcendentalist views. This philosophy, as well as his parent's strong commitment to philanthropy had a strong influence of Richard. Around the end of the 19th Century, such ideals were out of favour, with the dominant beliefs at the time being social Darwinism.
Professional career.
Cabot studied philosophy at Harvard University before switching to medicine. Inspired by the beliefs of John Dewey, Cabot felt more drawn to action than contemplation, and he admired the work of Teddy Roosevelt and Jane Addams. After completing his studies in 1892, he turned down the role of the first bacteriologist at Massachusetts General Hospital to work in the hospital's much less prestigious outpatient department. At this time, outpatient wards dealt mostly with people who couldn't afford inpatient treatment, or for the treatment of incurable chronic conditions such tuberculosis or diabetes. This involved working populations who lived in unhealthy, overcrowded accommodation, often recent migrants.
He changed the way that the outpatient department was run, believing that economic, social, family and psychological conditions underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with. He envisaged that social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors, the former concentrating on physiological health, and the latter on social health. In addition to this, he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting. In 1905 Cabot created one of the first positions of professional social worker in the world, given to Garnet Pelton, and then to Ida Cannon. The hospital refused to support the hiring of social workers, and Cabot had to pay their wages himself. Pelten developed tuberculosis herself soon after taking up the position and was forced to retire. Cannon stayed in the position for forty years and became Head of Social Work at the hospital. Cabot and Cannon pioneered many programs to improve the health of patients, including art classes for psychiatric patients, low-cost meals for patients and research on the social factors that increased a person's likelihood of developing tuberculosis.
In 1917 Cabot took up a position in the Medical Reserve Corps for a year. He returned briefly to Massachusetts General Hospital in 1918 and then left to take up the position of chair at Harvard's Department of Social Ethics in 1919. At this time, the hospital agreed to pay the wages of social workers, as up to this point, Cabot had paid the wages of thirteen social workers over the last 12 years. He went on to write about his experiences in his book "Social Work"
He is also credited with discovering Cabot rings, and for describing, along with his colleague, Locke, the eponymous Cabot-Locke murmur, a diastolic murmur occasionally heard in severe anemia, unrelated to heart valve abnormalities.
Cabot established a tradition of teaching conferences at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) that featured generating differential diagnoses, and founded the long standing feature of Case Record of MGH in "New England Journal of Medicine".
