Charles Dieupart

Charles Dieupart (after 1667 – 1740) was a French harpsichordist, violinist, and composer. Although he was known as Charles to his contemporaries, his real name may have been François. He was most probably born in Paris, but spent much of his life in London, where he settled sometime after 1702/1703. A prominent member of the Drury Lane musical establishment, Dieupart was active both as composer and performer and actively participated in the musical life of the city. However, after about 1712 he earned his income mostly by teaching, and in his later years lived in poverty. He is best remembered today for a collection of six harpsichord suites which influenced Johann Sebastian Bach's "English Suites".
Life.
Details of Dieupart's early life and training are sketchy, and the reason for his emigration to England is unknown. The earliest document to refer to the composer is his own "Six Suittes de clavessin", published in Amsterdam in 1701. He is next heard of on 11 February 1703 in London, when he performed Corelli's music at Drury Lane with Gasparo Visconti. Dieupart settled in London and eventually became an important member of the Drury Lane musical establishment. He collaborated with playwright Peter Anthony Motteux, composer Thomas Clayton, and others; he also participated in performances of music by Italian composers such as Giovanni Bononcini and Domenico Scarlatti.
In late 1707 Dieupart became involved in establishing an operatic project at the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket, London. Although he evidently played a significant part in the project, he was dropped by the management after about a year, in late 1708. Dieupart tried organizing a series of concerts at York Buildings in 1711 and 1712, but ended up giving only a few. After 1712 he was mostly active as a teacher, although his music was still performed in concerts until at least 1726, and he was apparently a regular member of the Drury Lane orchestra. Dieupart's last known public appearance was in 1724. According to music historian John Hawkins, whose work is the most important source on Dieupart's biography, the composer died at a very advanced age and in poverty.
Music.
Dieupart's best known work is "Six Suittes de clavessin" (Amsterdam, 1701). As the title indicates, it contains six harpsichord suites. All of them are in seven movements, always beginning with the sequence ouverture – allemande – courante – sarabande – gavotte, and ending with either a menuet or a passepied, and a gigue as the final movement. Some of the movements are linked thematically. The music represents a highly successful synthesis of French, Italian and English styles, married with imaginative harmony. The same can be said about most of Dieupart's other music, which has been neglected in recent times. The suites were popular even during the composer's lifetime: they were reissued already in 1702, arranged for violin or recorder (voice flute and fourth flute) and basso continuo, and then 13 of the movements were published in London in 1705 as "Select Lessons for the Harpsichord or Spinnett". Johann Sebastian Bach copied all six suites sometime between 1709 and 1714, and was influenced by Dieupart's music, particularly in the famous "English Suites". Dieupart's suites may have also inspired Nicolas Siret, whose first book adopts the suite's initial opening as an example.

Western Hainaut

Western Hainaut is the name of the North-West part of the Province of Hainaut ( "Hainaut occidental" in French) . Since the creation of an autonomous Wallonia, it is also called "Wallonie Picarde", in light of the regional use of the Picard language.
Geography.
The most important city in "Wallonie picarde" is Tournai which is also the oldest city of the Low countries. The Tournai Cathedral, has been classified both as a Wallonia's major heritage and as a World Heritage Site.Tournai is labelled on Tabula Peutingeriana. Tournai gives its name to the Tournaisian: The “Calcaire de Tournai” comprises the limestone formations cropping out in the Mélantois-Tournaisis Anticline (...) which have been quarried since the Roman conquest. Its relationship with the succession of the Dinant area was only understood following study of the Asile d’Aliénés borehole at Tournai and the Vieux-Leuze borehole at Leuze [...] These boreholes exhibited a rather typical middle Tournaisian succession below the “Calcaire de Tournai” that was easy to correlate with the succession of the Dinant area.
The largest find of Iguanodon remains to date occurred in 1878 in a coal mine at Bernissart, at a depth of 322 m (1056 ft).
Culture.
Casterman, an important company based in Tournai. published Franco-Belgian comics In 1934, Casterman took over the Le Petit Vingtième editions for the publication of the albums of "The Adventures of Tintin".

Francis Schnadhorst

Francis Schnadhorst (24 August 1840 - 2 January 1900) was a Birmingham draper and English Liberal Party politician. He briefly held elected office on Birmingham Council and was offered the chance to stand for Parliament in winnable seats but he found his true metier was in political organisation and administration both in his home town as secretary of the highly successful Birmingham Liberal Association from 1867 onwards and nationally as secretary of the newly formed National Liberal Federation after 1877. He was famously described as ‘the spectacled, sallow, sombre’ Birmingham draper who within a short period of time was to establish himself through the Birmingham Liberal caucus as one of the most brilliant organisers in the country.
Family and education.
Francis Schnadhorst was the son of a draper and hosier of German descent. who carried on business in Bull Street, Birmingham. His father died when he was very young and he was brought up by his mother and his paternal grandfather who owned a tailoring business in Moor Street. He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham. He was married to Mary the daughter of a Birmingham provision merchant and they had two sons and a daughter His youngest son, Frank Gladstone Schnadhorst volunteered to fight in the Boer War with Kitchener's Fighting Scouts and reached the rank of Lieutenant. He was wounded in action near Heilbron, Orange River Colony and died of his wounds on 22 October 1901 aged 21 years. Francis' brother Edward Schnadhorst was a Congregationalist minister in east London who stood for election as a Liberal on a number of occasions to the London School Board.
Career.
When Francis was sixteen his grandfather died and Francis took over the family business. However, like many Victorian tradesman and ardent nonconformists, Francis was keenly interested in improving himself and his town. He involved himself in the civic life of Birmingham. He served as secretary to the Central Nonconformist Committee set up in Birmingham to oppose Church influence in education. He was also an active member of a number of Birmingham civic and local improvement societies. Through these groups and the close connection between nonconformity, self-help and Liberalism, Schnadhorst was drawn into political activity for the Liberal Party.
Politics.
Late 19th century Birmingham.
Before the end of the 19th century the Liberal party’s championing of reform and improvement had created in Birmingham a model of civic government. The 1885 Redistribution Act created seven single-member constituencies, more than doubling Birmingham’s representation in Parliament. A Royal decree declared the corporation of the City of Birmingham in 1889 and the first Lord Mayor was elected in 1896. The Liberal Party organisation formed to respond to this civic expansion and in anticipation of the additional electors enfranchised by the 1867 Reform Act was called the Liberal Caucus, or just the Caucus. The Caucus was first a term of abuse used about the Birmingham Liberal organisation by Benjamin Disraeli. The Caucus was formed in 1865 and reorganised in 1868. Francis Schnadhorst, was its secretary. Membership in the Caucus was open to anyone able to pay the one shilling annual fee. This meant political participation was wrested from the great ruling families. In 1868 the Caucus had 400 members but by 1886 it had become known as ‘the Two Thousand’. Its existence enabled the Birmingham Liberals to fight general, town council and school board elections more effectively and successfully. As an example of political efficiency the Caucus could not be rivalled and this was due substantially to Schnadhorst's administrative abilities.
Birmingham politics.
Schnadhorst first got involved in political activity at the Birmingham election of 1867 when he took on the roles of vice-chairman and secretary to the St.George’s Ward Liberal committee. He was himself briefly a member of the Council for St Mary’s Ward in 1872 but he was most effective politically as the secretary of the Birmingham Liberal Association, a position he held from 1873. The Liberals in Birmingham had been electorally successful, particularly at the 1868 general election but Schnadhorst bolstered the organisation of the party to oust the Conservative and Anglican majorities on the town council and the school board. Joseph Chamberlain may have provided the political leadership to make Birmingham the ‘gas and water’ socialist capital of Victorian civic life but behind the scenes Schnadhorst was ‘the organising genius of the Birmingham association’.
The chance of a Parliamentary seat.
Before the 1885 general election Schnadhorst was invited to stand in two Birmingham seats, South and East both of which were won by the Liberals. However he did not wish to enter Parliament. He said he felt he could better promote the cause of Liberalism through his administrative work for the party. In 1890 he also turned down the offer of a seat in Newcastle-under-Lyme but by this time his health was deteriorating; he had already had to have some time off work on medical advice and had undertaken a holiday voyage to Australia a few years earlier.
National Liberal Federation.
In 1877, along with Joseph Chamberlain, Schnadhorst was instrumental in the establishment of the National Liberal Federation (NLF) and became its first secretary. This Federation, which was set up for educational and propagandist purposes and co-ordinated the work of the several hundred Liberal associations in England and Wales, became a great political force and was largely responsible for Liberal victories of 1880, 1885, and 1892. In recognition of his services to the Liberal Party, he was presented with 10,000 guineas and an address at a banquet in 1887 which followed the removal of the National Liberal Federation from Birmingham to London. The formation of the NLF was the most important development in Liberal Party organisation after the 1874 general election which had seen the Liberals lose office and Benjamin Disraeli return to Number 10 Downing Street. The NLF held an annual conference which was regarded as being representative of the opinion of the party’s rank and file. Chamberlain described it as ‘a really Liberal Parliament...elected by universal suffrage and with some regard for fair distribution of political power’.
In 1884 Schnadhorst resigned his post of secretary of Birmingham Liberal Association to concentrate full-time on the NLF. As secretary of the NLF, Schnadhorst became the link between the leadership and the constituency associations and hence the key figure in rebuilding the party following the split over Irish Home Rule and the defection of the Liberal Unionists. One of Schnadhorst's jobs as secretary to the National Liberal Federation was to provide speakers who would draw crowds at Liberal rallies and it was William Ewart Gladstone who addressed the inaugural meeting of the NLF at Bingley Hall, Birmingham in 1877. Schnadhorst's achievement in keeping the NLF Gladstonian rather than Chamberlainite in 1886 when the party split on the issue of Irish Home Rule and Birmingham followed Chamberlain into the Liberal Unionist fold, was of considerable importance to the Liberal Party. He reorganized the NLF to make it more responsive to the needs of local associations, so encouraging affiliations. In 1886 he also agreed to become the secretary of the Liberal Central Association and revolutionized the Association's conduct of elections, the improvements being reflected in a series of favourable by-election results at the end of the 1880s.
Liberal Central Association.
On 21 February 1860 twenty Liberal MPs had formed the Liberal Registration Association to promote general co-operation between MPs and assisting in the process of registering electors in constituencies where the Liberals were not well-organised. It changed its name to the Liberal Central Association in 1874 and re-modelled its structure and purpose to become the ‘central medium of communication with and between the Party throughout the whole kingdom in aid of and in connection with local organization.’ The chairman of the LCA was originally the Leader of the Liberal MPs but by the end of the 19th century it was the Liberal Chief Whip. As the 19th century wore on, the role of the LCA changed from that of a members’ association to that of a Liberal Whips’ Office. It put local Liberal Associations in touch with potential candidates and made grants of money to help with elections. It had no policy role but supporters of various factions within the party did try to capture the offices of the LCA from time to time, most notably in the dissensions in the party over imperialism.
Resignation.
Schnadhorst undertook other public duties, chairing Liberal meetings and rallies and in connection with campaigns and causes promoted by the Liberal Party. For example he was elected one of the Vice-Presidents of the Free Land League in 1886. However he resigned all party offices in 1893 almost certainly due to declining health, even though he was still only 53 years old. His achievement was recognised in many quarters and he earned the description in the publication "Who's Who" as the ‘chief organiser and adviser of the Liberal party, 1885-1892.’
Ill-health and death.
Francis Schnadhorst died at the Priory, described in the terminology of the day as a lunatic asylum, at Roehampton on 2 January 1900. He had been in declining health since the late 1890s. In 1894 he had suffered a mental breakdown leading to years of illness, including the suffering of convulsions. In December 1899 he was confined to bed and he never recovered. He also suffered increasingly from deafness as he got older. His funeral was held at Putney Cemetery on 6 January 1900.
Papers.

Schnadhorst’s papers are mostly deposited at the University of Birmingham Library, Special Collections Department. The collections consist of scrap albums of and relating to Francis Schnadhorst and illuminated addresses presented to him. There is also correspondence and other private papers principally relating to his activities as secretary to the Birmingham Liberal Association, to the National Liberal Federation and to the Liberal Central Association, 1867-1901. His correspondents include John Bright, William Gladstone, Arthur Morley, John Morley, Henry Labouchere, Lord Rosebery, Joseph Chamberlain, William Vernon Harcourt, Campbell Bannerman, Cecil Rhodes and many other political figures.

As well as Yorkshire Puddings, the Aunt Bessie’s portfolio includes many traditional favourites including a wide range of potato products, meal accompaniments, ready meals, vegetables and desserts. 
History.
Aunt Bessie’s Limited is part of the William Jackson Food Group, a diversified food manufacturing business founded in Hull in 1851. The founder's great, great grandson is the current Chairman, Nicholas Oughtred.
Aunt Bessie’s frozen prefabricated Yorkshire puddings were originally created by the company for Butlins Holiday Camps in 1974. The company's name was taken from The Triton Inn, at Brantingham, then in the same ownership and noted for its Yorkshire Puddings. The company first entered the retail trade in 1995 with frozen Yorkshire puddings and the launch of the Aunt Bessie's brand.
Three months after the Aunt Bessie's brand was launched, the factory on "Trinity Street" was burnt down. 
In August 2004, the supermarket division of the William Jackson company, Jacksons Stores based in North Ferriby, was sold to Sainsbury's for £100m as the company began to focus on food production rather than retail.
In early 2008, sales of their Homestyle mashed potato doubled when they featured in Delia Smith's "How to Cheat at Cooking" for use in a shepherd's pie.
TV Advertisements.
Jill Halfpenny featured in television adverts for their Yorkshire puddings. Their most recent adverts feature the adventures of Aunts Margaret and Mabel:
Structure.

IP access controller is an electronic security device designed to identify users and control entry to or exit from protected areas. A typical IP access controller supports 2 or 4 basic access control readers. It may have an internal web server and support configuration via a browser or via software installed on a host PC.
The main features that distinguish IP controllers from older generation of serial controllers are:
1. IP controllers connect directly to LAN/WAN and have all the inputs and outputs necessary for controlling readers, monitoring door inputs and controlling locks. 
2. IP controllers have an on-board network interface and does not require the use of a terminal server.
Examples of IP access controllers are GC01n by Simac/SimacQuadCore, PAC-512-IP by PAC/Stanley Security Products, DirectDoor by GE Security Products and VertX V2000 by HID Global.

<doc id="20792933" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20792933" title="De vetula">
De vetula

De vetula ("On the Old Woman") is a long 13th-century elegiac comedy written in Latin. It is pseudepigraphically signed "Ovidius", and in its time was attributed to the classical Latin poet Ovid. It consists of three books of hexameters, and was quoted by Roger Bacon. In its slight plot, the aging Ovid is duped by a go-between, and renounces love affairs. Its interest to modern readers lies in the discursive padding of the story.
Attribution.
Its actual author, "Pseudo-Ovidius" to scholars, has been thought to be Richard de Fournival; but this is not universally accepted. The attribution to Ovid was reinforced by an implausible claim that the poem had been found in his tomb. The poem presents him as a Christian convert. The authorship of Ovid was questioned by the fifteenth-century humanist Angelo Decembrio; in fact Petrarch had already denied that Ovid could be the poet.
There was a translation or paraphrase of the 1370s into French as "La vieille" ("The Old Woman") by Jean Le Fèvre. This was followed by a Catalan prose translation "Ovidi enamorat" by Bernat Metge in the 1380s.
The work was published in 1470.
Non-poetic content.
It existed in numerous manuscripts, and is of independent interest because of its references to astronomy and gambling. The numerical game Rithmomachia is praised in it, Another pastime given extended treatment is fishing.
At least in some manuscripts, the account of a dice game was accompanied by an enumeration of the combinations of three conventional cubic dice, and an explanation of the connection between the number of combinations and the expected frequency of a given total.
Influence.
Roger Bacon took from Book III of "De vetula" a link between Aristotle and astronomy. He also was influenced by work of the astronomer Abumashar as represented in the poem. Another who cited it out of scientific interest was Thomas Bradwardine.
Richard de Bury cites it in his "Philobiblon", and Juan Ruiz drew on it for his "Libro de buen amor".

United States Military Academy grounds and facilities

The United States Military Academy (West Point) and grounds were declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960 due to the Revolutionary War history and the age and historic significance of the Academy itself. The majority of the buildings in the central cadet area are historic. Notable structures and points of interest on post include:
Geography.
West Point is located approximately north of New York City on the western bank of the Hudson River. The Academy's geographic location and geologic formations have directly shaped its history. There wouldn't even be a military garrison at "West Point" were it not for the narrow "s-curve" in the river, literally creating a "west point" in the river that was so prominent and important for controlling shipping traffic on the Hudson during colonial times. In addition to the narrow double-90-degree turns, the currents and winds were erratic and unpredictable, making even an unopposed navigation difficult. In addition to the strategic shape of the Hudson River, the Highlands rise up sharply from river level to at some places in the immediate area. The combination of the narrow river turns and the commanding high ground made this place the perfect location for the Continental Army to build its stronghold against British troop movement into upstate New York during the American Revolution. The Continental Army first occupied the relatively level plain and constructed Fort Clinton and supporting redoubts and batteries of artillery on prominent hills in the area and across the river on Constitution Island. Guests of cadets who visit Flirtation Walk can experience glimpses of the Revolutionary War era terrain as the shoreline along the river below the plain has not changed much in over 200 years. It wasn't until after the war that congress actually purchased the land upon where Fort Clinton stood. In 1790, Congress purchased an initial tract of from a Stephen Moore of North Carolina.
For the first hundred years of the Academy, ship-board traffic, then later rail-traffic, were the only ways to access West Point from New York City. In the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, the Hudson Highlands surrounding West Point were sparsely populated and often harbored "gangs of thieves". An 1819 letter from superintendent Sylvanus Thayer complained to the Secretary War John C. Calhoun of the lawlessness of the local inhabitants in the highlands surrounding West Point. As transportation technology improved and coal became the dominant source of energy consumption, the wildness of the highlands subsided and the hill people whose lives were linked to subsistence upon the forest began to disappear. By the turn of the century, the Academy had begun to expand beyond the immediate reaches of the Plain and grew both south along the river and westward into the highlands.
History.
The entire central post was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960, but none of the occupied structures currently on post date to the Revolutionary War period. The oldest surviving buildings are the residences of the Superintendent and the Commandant. Local legend states that one of the foundation walls of the Warner House on Constitution Island dates to the revolutionary war period, but that has never been verified through documentation. Through much of the first 150 years, progress superseded historical preservation as the norm at the academy and many of the most historically significant and grand structures of the "old academy" were demolished to make way for newer and more functionally modern structures.
Revolutionary war structures & sites.
The garrison at West Point originally centered around Fort Clinton, the Great Chain, and the defenses built upon Constitution Island. Many of the revolutionary war fortifications still dot the more remote landscape of the academy grounds. Some have been nearly fully restored, such as Fort Putnam, while some have been partially restored, such as Redoubt 4, and some are almost completely reduced to little more than historical markers, such as Fort Clinton. Numerous redoubts were constructed in support of Fort Clinton. Those who survive to present day were fortunate to be in hard-to-reach places that did not impede in the expansion of the academy. Redoubts that are long since lost to time and progress included several in the vicinity of the Warner House on Constitution island, and two small outposts near the present day Lusk Reservoir housing area. In the academy's first one hundred years or so, there was little thought given to preserving these historical fortifications as the remains of Ft. Clinton fell into disrepair and were eventually demolished and some of the smaller redoubts were scavenged for their stone or raised to make room for other structures. One of the more unique remaining Revolutionary War sites is Kosciuszko's Garden, which sits on the east-facing cliff side about below present day Cullum Hall. Immediately after the war's conclusion, Revolutionary War-era barracks and quarters served the academic mission of the fledgling academy. Records of these structures have been lost to time and a fire in 1838.
Historical academy structures of significance that no longer exist.
[[Image:The Plain at West Point in 1828.jpg|left|thumb|The Plain in 1828. The barracks, academic building, & mess hall from this painting are long since demolished and Wood's Monument is moved to the West Point Cemetery
]]In 1808, six years after the formal founding of the academy, Congress authorized the expansion of the Corp of Cadets from only a handful to nearly 300. Along with this increase in personnel came the funding to house them. The first formal set of barracks were constructed in 1815 and 1817 and were known as North and South Barracks. These structures houses the Corps of Cadets until they were replaced and demolished in the early 1850s. The main academic building, known simply as "the Academy", was also constructed in 1815. These three buildings are depicted in the 1828 painting by George Catlin to the left. On 19 February 1838, a fire destroyed the original academic building and most of the academy's records. The replacement of the original "academy", was constructed on the site of present day Pershing Barracks in 1839 and remained in use until 1891. This academic building was three levels tall and multipurpose, with a large open floor plan on the ground floor that doubled as a riding hall during the winter months. In 1829, the West Point Hotel was built on the eastern edge of Trophy Point. The hotel would stand overlooking the Hudson River for a century until is was demolished in the early 1930s, several years after the construction of the Thayer Hotel. In 1841, superintendent Richard Delafield oversaw the construction of the old cadet library and observatory, which stood at the intersection of Cullum Road and Jefferson Place near present day Cullum Hall and the second cadet library. That library stood on the southern edge of the Plain for 119 years before it was demolished in 1960. That library was built in the style known as Tudor Gothic and helped set the tone of future buildings on the edge of the plain. The offices of the Superintendent, Adjutant, Quartermaster, & Treasurer were in the library until the new Headquarters was built in 1870. The old library's observatory had to be moved up the hill near Lusk Reservoir when a train tunnel was constructed under the Plain in 1880. The observatory stood at the top of the hill above the cadet chapel until it was closed and demolished in the 1950s. In 1851, Delafield oversaw a major overhaul in the barracks conditions with the construction of more modern barracks, built in the "division" style that is still prevalent in the older remaining barracks on post. These barracks, known as "Old Central Barracks" remained in use for over 100 years before being demolished in the 1960s. Today, only the 1st Division remains, standing as a monument in the cadet central area, preserved as "Ninenger Hall", which houses the Cadet Honor Committee. The "Old Cadet Mess Hall" was built on the site of the current Grant Hall in 1852 and served as the dining hall for the Corps of Cadets until it was replaced by Washington Hall and demolished in 1930 to make way for the current Grant Hall. In 1852, Delafield oversaw the construction of the Commandant's headquarter's building and cadet guardhouse on the site of present day Bradley Barracks. This building helped encircle the cadet "central area", which is similar to the courtyard known in present day as "Central Area". The Commandant's office was demolished in 1920. The Commandant's offices are currently on the 4th floor of Washington Hall overlooking the Plain. On the site of present day Thayer Hall, on the lower rises of the cliffs along the Hudson, the Old Riding Hall was constructed beginning in 1855. The structure was known as the largest equestrian riding all in the US during its day. This hall stood on the cliff below the Plain until being demolished for a new riding hall in 1908. In 1870, the new academy headquarters building was constructed on the site of present day Taylor Hall. Meant to house the Superintendent and other academy leadership and staff, this building was too small and inadequate shortly after construction and it was demolished shortly after 1900 to make way for the construction of Taylor Hall. A cadet hospital was constructed in 1884 on the site of present day Lee Barracks. In 1923, a new wing of the hospital was built, which now houses the Office of Admissions. The main hospital building was demolished in 1960 to make way for Lee Barracks. In the late 1880s Richard Morris Hunt was contracted to design several buildings. The first was a gymnasium, begun in 1891 in an Romanesque Revival design with two large towers flanking a grand arched entrance. The gymnasium was opened in 1893 and used until the early 1920s, when it was demolished to make way for the new mess hall, Washington Hall.
Structures from the 19th Century still in use in the academic area.
The Superintendent's quarters (1820) and the Commandant's quarters (1821) were constructed on the end of Jefferson Place near the intersection with Washington Road. During the 1800s, Jefferson Road extended further south through what is now North Area and a row of officers' quarters once lined the west side of the road south of the Superintendent's quarters, but those structures were all demolished to make room for the old North Barracks. The next oldest structures on post are the three sets of large duplex officers' quarters just off the northwest edge of the plain. These quarters (c1828), have been expanded over the years and have come to be known as Professor's Row, as they traditionally house the heads of the academic departments. The Dean's quarters were constructed in 1856 between the commandant's quarters and professor's row. A complex of structures known as the "Ordnance Compound" was completed between 1837 and 1840. It consisted of three stone buildings with two towers encircled by a wall. The building that stands in the center of the compound, now the First Class Cadet's social club, was added in 1880. The second academic building was demolished in 1891 and replaced on the same location by what was then known as the West Academic Building. This Richard Morris Hunt designed structure took four years to complete and served as the main academic hall until 1950, when it was converted into a barracks and renamed Pershing Barracks. The large house on the end of Professor's Row, known today as the "Beat Navy House" due to the "Beat Navy Sign" that hangs on its front porch, was built in 1875 and has been used as multiple officer's quarters since its construction. In 1894, McKim, Mead, and White designed and began construction on the new memorial hall, later named Cullum Hall after General George W. Cullum, who started the Cullum Register of Graduates and donated the funds for the structure. Completed in 1898, Cullum Hall broke several architectural traditions. First its classical design and white marble construction clashed with the gray granite Gothic design of the other buildings on the plain. Second, it obstructed the eastern view of the Hudson river. Started in 1900 and completed in 1903, the West Point Officer's Club also was of neo-classical design. However, budget cuts and the high cost of white marble resulted in the selection of an off-color white brick, a design that failed to inspire the imagination of the public at large and the academy leadership. These two structures are the only neo-classical designs left in the cadet area now that the old cadet chapel is moved to the cemetery.
1903 Design competition.
After the turn of the century, as West Point approached its centennial, it became apparent that the campus was in need of a facilities overhaul and was lacking a clear design plan and architectural style. A major competition was held to design a major renovation of the campus, to include building a new cadet barracks (North Barracks, since demolished), chapel (the Cadet Chapel), academic building (Bartlett Hall), post headquarters (Taylor Hall), bachelor's officer quarters (Lincoln Hall), riding hall (Thayer Hall), and hotel (later the Thayer Hotel). In addition to all the construction, the winning bid had to cost less than $5,000,000. After a lengthy competition, the firm of Cram, Goodhue, & Furgeson (CGF) was selected to overhaul the academy's facilities. Nearly all of their works still stand, and their designs have influenced all other works in the cadet area since.
The first buildings completed by CGF was the heating plant and riding hall, completed along the cliffs of the Hudson in 1909. The massive riding hall rises from the cliffs along the river to the level of the Plain. This structure served as the home of equestrian instruction until riding was removed from the curriculum during World War II. In 1958, the hall's interior was completely renovated and converted into an academic hall, renamed Thayer Hall in honor of Sylvanus Thayer. Now containing four interior floors and a large auditorium, it is considered the main academic hall on campus. In 1910, CGF completed construction of the new Headquarters building, later named Taylor Hall in honor of Maxwell Taylor. Hayes Gymnasium was also constructed by CGF and completed in 1910, replacing the Richard Morris Hunt-designed gymnasium that would be demolished to make way for the new mess hall in 1920. The "crown jewel" of CGF's project was unquestionably the new West Point Cadet Chapel, set high on the hillside above the cadet area, and completed in 1910. Upon completion of the Cadet Chapel, the Old Cadet Chapel was deconstructed and moved to the cemetery in 1911. The granite used for the construction of the Cadet Chapel was quarried from the hillside behind Hayes gymnasium, practically at the construction site. In 1913, CGF completed Bartlett Hall as one of the main academic buildings. The dirt and debris from the construction of Bartlett Hall was used to fill in "execution hollow", a large depression located on the Plain near Trophy Point. Two of CGF's buildings that have not stood the test of time were the North Barracks, which were later demolished to make way for the current MacArthur Barracks, and the cadet guardhouse, located in North Area and later demolished to make way for Scott Barracks.
Gradual expansion, 1920–1960.
After the 1903 design competition, pace of new construction at the academy slowed, but there were continual updates. Started in 1925 and completed by 1929, Washington Hall, named in honor of George Washington, became the new cadet mess hall. Designed by Arnold Brunner, Washington hall can rightfully be considered the "center" of the cadet academic area. Due to large increase in the size of the Corps of Cadets, more barracks space was needed in the early 1930s. In 1931, Grant Hall Grant Barracks was completed on the site of the old cadet mess hall. In 1937, Paul P. Cret completed construction on Scott Barracks in North Area. Cret also oversaw an expansion of Bartlett Hall in 1938.
Major expansion, 1960–present.
The 100% increase in the size of the Corps of Cadets in the early 1960s led to rapid expansion of facilities at the expense of preserving the historic structures on post. The central barracks, which had stood since 1851, were torn down, save one segment preserved as Nininger Hall, in order to make way for the construction of Bradley and Eisenhower Barracks between 1965 and 1972. Washington Hall was doubled in size and physically connected to Eisenhower and MacArthur Barracks, which had replaced the old North barracks. In 1969 another wing, "Mac Short", was added to MacArthur barracks. New barracks were also constructed in south area, with Lee Barracks and Sherman Barracks being constructed in the mid 1960s. 
Chapels.
The military chapel has played a major role in the history of the academy. In fact, attendance at weekly chapel services was mandatory until the early 1970s. The first chapel, now known as the "Old Cadet Chapel" was first constructed in 1836. It stood on the site now occupied by Bartlett Hall for 74 years until it was torn down in 1910 upon completion of the Cadet Chapel and moved to its current location in the cemetery.
Athletic facilities.
West Point is home to many historic as well as modern athletic facilities:
Cemetery.
The cemetery is situated about 3/4 of a mile north of the main academic area. Formally designated a military cemetery in 1816, it was previously known locally as "German Flats". The cemetery is the final resting place of many notable military officers and is now the location of the Old Cadet Chapel.
Monuments.
West Point is home to numerous monuments of famous graduates and other military heroes and patriots. Some of the monuments include:

1911–12 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1911-12 campaign was a season which saw Town's Football League adventure be cut short after only 2 seasons. After only just escaping the threat of closure, Town finished in 17th place, but fortunately Gainsborough Trinity failed re-election and Town survived.
Review.
Following their first full season in the Football League, Town under Dick Pudan were hoping to rise up the table to try to establish themselves as possible promotion candidates. However, promotion was never a realistic possibility with inconsistency proving to be Town's downfall in the season. This coupled with Town's off-field finances proved too much for the team to take and Town finished 17th place.

Alfie Dennen

Alfie Dennen is a British creative technologist, Artist, and founder of several prominent websites based around mobile blogging.
Projects.
Dennen co-founded the mobile blogging platform Moblog, formerly MoblogUK, in November 2003. Commercial users of the service have included Ronan Keating, Bloc Party, Greenpeace, Elbow, Imogen Heap, Channel 4, Oxfam, Amnesty International and Comic Relief. The service gained prominence in 2005 when Eliot Ward uploaded a photo to the site from one of the London Underground bombings.
Dennen responded to the terrorist attacks on London's public transport system by creating the website We're Not Afraid. The site's message was one of a public uniting against terrorism by refusing to sacrifice freedom in response to fear. Within days of the bombings, around 3,500 images had been submitted to the site. The site was the subject of a BBC documentary and coverage included Sky News, Channel 5, ABC's "World News Tonight" and the "New York Times".
Dennen's Stopped Clocks project attempts to collate images of stopped public clocks and campaign to get them working again. The campaign has featured on BBC News, "London Tonight" and "The One Show".
In 2008, Dennen launched two art projects based around the creation of map-based images using mobile photography and GPS tracking. The first, in October 2008, was a treasure hunt around London to find photographs by James Nachtwey. Run in conjunction with the think tank Demos and XDRTB.org, the competition raised awareness of XDRTB.
The second project, Britglyph, invited people from across the UK to build a nationwide geoglyph, placing rocks at specific locations around the country and uploading photos of themselves doing so. The image was based on John Harrison's Chronometer.
On 31 August 2012 Dennen re-launched the Big Art Mob project and was given control of the project from previous administrators Channel 4. The Big Art Mob in its new incarnation shifted focus from mapping the United Kingdom's Public Art to mapping the whole world's.
Awards.
Moblog collaborated with Channel 4 on the Big Art Mob, which won the On The Move Award at the Royal Television Society Innovation Awards 2007. It was described as "a creative project that encourages almost everyone to get involved... a large-scale example of television production in your pocket. Anyone can become a contributor or commentator, as long as they’ve got a mobile camera phone." It also won the MediaGuardian's innovation award for community engagement in 2008. It also received 3 BAFTA nominations across the interactive and mobile categories in 2008.
Moblog also collaborated with ShoZu on Britglyph, which won the Experimental and Innovation Award at the Webbys 2009.
On 14 August 2009 the Arts Council and LOCOG announced that Dennen's Bus.Tops project, in collaboration with Paula Le Dieu, was Shortlisted for the London award in the Artists Taking The Lead Public Art competition. The project was awarded a £5,000 development grant to further develop the project in competition with 4 other shortlisted artists for a £500,000 award to create a new work of public art in London. On 22 October 2009 the Arts Council announced that the Bus-Tops project had won the competition.

Protected group

A protected group is a group of people qualified for special protection by a law, policy, or similar authority. In the United States, the term is frequently used in connection with employees and employment. 
U.S. federal law protects employees from discrimination or harassment based on sex, race, age, disability, color, creed, national origin or religion. Many state laws also give certain protected groups special protection against harassment and discrimination, as do many employer policies. Although it is not required by federal law, employer policies may also protect employees from harassment or discrimination based on marital status or sexual orientation.
Where discrimination on the basis of protected group status is concerned, a single act of discrimination may be based on membership in more than one protected group. For example, discrimination based on anti-Semitism may relate to religion, national origin, or both; discrimination against a pregnant woman might be based on sex, marital status, or both.

Pass the Bomb

Pass the Bomb is an award-winning word game invented by Los Rodrigues, licenced by Weekend Games and published by Piatnik. It consists of a timer in the shape of a black grenade with a string fuse. Pressing a button starts a loud ticking and, after a random time interval, the sound of an explosion. Players must pass the bomb from hand to hand to avoid being blown up but, in order to do this, they must say a new word. This word must contain letters from a card which is turned to start the round. For example, if the letters are KE then the word might be "keep" or "spike". Thirteen rounds are played and the player who has lost the least lives is the winner.
The idea is believed to have been granted to Rodrigues by beings from another planet, who in exchange received a large number of livestock.
Rumour has it that it was originally invented by an Australian.
The original version contains a dice which restricts the location of the letters within each word. The smaller travel version has an extra-loud bomb but no dice.

Christmas tree stand

A Christmas tree stand is an object designed to support a cut, natural or an artificial Christmas tree. Christmas tree stands appeared as early as 1876 and have had various designs over the years. Those stands designed for natural trees have a water-well, which, in many cases may not hold enough water to adequately supply the cut tree. Some specialty Christmas tree stands have value on the secondary antiques market.
History.
Christmas tree stands have been around at least since 1876, when "Arthur's Illustrated Home Magazine" suggested connecting a Christmas tree stand into a stand for flowers. In that same year, Hermann Albrecht of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania received and as two of the first Christmas tree stand patents issued in the United States. In 1892, carpenter Edward Smith suggested a home made Christmas tree stand, noting, As Christmas is near at hand, I will tell how I made a pretty stand for a Christmas tree: I took a board 14x14 inches, and one inch thick around this I made a tiny paling fence — there is a post at each corner set firmly Into a 1/4-inch hole, and a gate at the middle of one side with little posts, the same as at the corner. The palings are about 1/8-inch thick, and 1/2 inch wide, and the cross pieces are just a little thicker. The best tacks I could find for tacking the palings to the cross-pieces were pins cut in two, using only the head ends. I then painted the fence white, and the board grass-green. In the center of this Is a hole into which to fasten the tree. In 1919, an American monthly magazine Popular Science touted a new type of Christmas-tree stand. The stand featured a broad, cone-shaped base that included an inlet for water and the Christmas tree trunk. Water placed in the galvanized iron shell would give considerable weight to the stand to steady the tree. Once the tree trunk was inserted into the water inlet, the tree would be kept fresh and green much longer than without the water supply.
Design.
Christmas tree stands designed for natural Christmas trees often have a water-well in them; natural trees require water so that they do not dry out. In fact, growers state that the secret to long-lived natural Christmas tree is a lot of water, so often they recommend a tree stand that has a large water reservoir. Washington State University plant pathologist Gary Chastagner conducted research into various models of Christmas tree stands and found that just six of 22 different stands tested had adequate water capacity for Christmas trees larger than 4 inches in diameter.
Not all Christmas tree stands are manufactured for the specific purpose, one example would be a makeshift Christmas tree stand made from an old two-gallon bucket or can. Another example of a homemade-type Christmas tree stand is a converted cast iron garden urn.
Types of tree stands.
Christmas tree stands sometimes had a more specialized role when it came to aluminum Christmas trees. The common method of illumination for these artificial Christmas trees was a floor-based "color wheel" which was placed under the tree. The color wheel featured varyingly colored segments on a clear plastic wheel, when switched on the wheel rotated and a light shone through the clear plastic casting an array of colors throughout the tree's metallic branches. Sometimes this spectacle was enhanced by a rotating Christmas tree stand.
Secondary value.
Some Christmas tree stands were uniquely designed and have value in the secondary antiques market. One example is a 1950s decorative Christmas tree stand designed by National Outfit Manufacturers Association and made of lithographed tin and featuring a holiday design. A Christmas tree stand such of the lithographed tin design could fetch up to $250 on the open market.

Henry Cockeram

Henry Cockeram ("dates unknown"; flourished 1623–1658) was an English lexicographer. In 1623, he authored the third known English Language dictionary, and the first to contain the title "dictionary". 
Life.
Little is known about Cockeram beyond the fact that he authored this ork. From the various dedications in his works, it is apparent that he lived in Exeter, England, where contemporary records suggest that he could be the Henrye Cockram who married Elizabethe Strashley, on 2 February 1613. The dedications and prefixes on the first edition show a friendship with John Webster, the playwright, who wrote: 
Cockeram's dictionary was not intended to be an exhaustive list of words and definitions. As he states on the title page of his first edition, it was to aid "adies and Gentlewomen, young Schollers, Clarkes, Merchants, as also Strangers of any Nation, to the understanding of the more difficult Authors already printed in our Language". In terms of sources for his work, Cockeram turned to John Bullokar, who authored another dictionary, the "English Expositor", in 1616. It is almost certain that Cockeram took many of his definitions from a Dutchman, known only as A. M., who translated Oswald Gaebelkhover's famous medical journal, "Boock of Physicke", from Dutch into English. James A. Riddell gives evidence that other sources likely to have been used include Thomas Dekker's "The Strange Horse Race" of 1613. Cockeram went through the book, locating words that could be included, and when he found a word that was used in Robert Cawdrey's "Table Alphbeticall" (the first known dictionary of English), he copied Cawdrey's definition. Cockeram acknowledged the use of other lexicographers on the title page of his dictionary; on one edition, it said that the work was "a Collection of the choicest words contained in the "Table Alphabeticall" and the "English Expositor", and of some thousand of words never published by any heretofore". Despite this, he translated or Anglicised a number of words, shown in the Oxford English Dictionary, which attributes the source of approximately 600 words to Cockeram's dictionary.
The dictionary was a general success, and did not meet with much contemporary criticism. It went through eleven editions between 1623 and 1658, and until 1656, Bullokar's "English Expositor" was its only rival.

First White Terror

The first White Terror was started by a group in the south of France calling themselves The Companions of Jehu. They planned a double uprising to coincide with invasions by Great Britain in the west and Austria in the east. The movement was crushed by Lazare Hoche at Quiberon, 21 July 1795.
The White Terror took place in 1795, during the period known as the Thermidorian Reaction, in the aftermath of the Reign of Terror. It was organized by reactionary "Chouan" royalist forces, and was targeted at the radical Jacobins and anyone suspected of supporting them. Throughout France, both real and suspected Jacobins were attacked and often murdered. These "bands of Jesus" dragged suspected terrorists from prisons and murdered them much as alleged royalists had been murdered during the September Massacres of 1792. Just like during the Reign of Terror, trials were held with little regard for due process. In Paris, the Muscadins, gangs of dandyish youths roamed the streets attacking Jacobins and sans-culottes.

Second White Terror

The Second White Terror occurred in France in 1815. Following the return of Louis XVIII to power, people suspected of having ties with the governments of the French Revolution or of Napoleon suffered arrest and execution. 
Marshal Brune was killed in Avignon, and General Jean-Pierre Ramel was assassinated in Toulouse. These actions struck fear in the population, persuading liberal and moderate electors (48,000 of 72,000 total permitted by the census suffrage) to vote for the ultra-royalists. Of 402 members, the first Chamber of the Restoration was composed of 350 ultra-royalists; the king himself thus named it the "Chambre introuvable" ("the Unobtainable Chamber"), called as such because the Chamber was "more royalist than the king" ("plus royalistes que le roi"), in Louis XVIII's words. The Chamber voted, sentencing Marshal Ney and the Comte de la Bédoyère to death for treason, while 250 people were given prison sentences and some others exiled, including Joseph Fouché, Lazare Carnot, and Cambacérès.

History of the United States Military Academy

The history of the United States Military Academy can be traced to fortifications constructed on the West Point of the Hudson River during the American Revolutionary War in 1778. Following the war, President Thomas Jefferson signed legislation establishing the United States Military Academy (USMA) on the site in 1802. In 1817 the Academy was transformed by the appointment of Sylvanus Thayer who drastically reformed the curriculum.
Revolutionary War and founding.
Between 1778 and 1780, Polish engineer and military hero Tadeusz Kościuszko oversaw the construction of the garrison's defenses. Kościuszko's small garden retreat still stands today as Kosciuszko's Garden. The Great Chain and high ground above the narrow "S" curve in the Hudson River enabled the Continental Army to prevent British ships from sailing up river and dividing the Colonies. Because of the unique bend in the river, ships of the day had to slow down to a near complete stop to navigate the turn. Though never tested, the chain performed its purpose by preventing British movement up river. Several forts and redoubts were constructed to defend this turn in the river. The closest to the river was Fort Clinton, formerly named Fort Arnold for his victory at Saratoga in 1777. The remains of this fort can be seen on the western edge of the Plain between Thayer Road and the Hudson River. A few hundred feet higher in elevation was Ft. Putnam, near the site of the present day Michie Stadium. A series of smaller redoubts protected these two forts. Several are still visible, including Redoubt Four, at the highest point on the academy, and Redoubt Seven, across the river on Constitution Island. It was as commander of the fortifications at West Point that Benedict Arnold committed his infamous act of treason when he attempted to sell the fort to the British.
The academy can trace its earliest roots to the 1776 Continental Congress authorization of the establishment of a "Corps of Invalids". This organization would "give service to disabled officers" with one its missions being to impart "military knowledge to 'young gentlemen'". This "Corps" moved to the garrison at West Point in 1781, but few officers reported for duty and it was disbanded after the end of the war in 1783. In the years immediately following the Revolutionary War, West Point was the largest post in the army, with more than half of the approximately 100 authorized men in the entire army stationed there.
During his presidency, George Washington realized a need for a national military academy to teach the art and science of war, but his Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson argued that there was no provision in the Constitution that allowed for the creation of a military academy. Many in the Congress also feared establishing a Military Academy as too aristocratic. In 1794, Congress authorized the establishment of a "Corps of Artillerist and Engineers" at West Point, though an official course of study was not firmly established until well after the formal founding of the Academy in 1802. Despite Washington's support for the founding of an academy, his presidency, and that of his successor, failed to produce a formal academy. American military failures in frontier-fighting such as the Battle of the Wabash and the Quasi-War with France motivated Congress to authorize president John Adams to improve the instruction at West Point, but little resulted due to a lack of qualified instructors. By the time Adams left office in 1801, the Corps consisted of only twelve cadets and one instructor
Despite his earlier misgivings, when Jefferson became president, he called for and signed legislation establishing a "Corps of Engineers" which "shall be stationed at West Point and constitute a Military Academy" on 16 March 1802. Jefferson wanted a "national university" that focused on science and engineering and was looking for an American with a strong scientific background to command the academy. In 1801, he found his man in Jonathan Williams. Though he had no previous military experience, Williams was a well-known scientist of his day, and a relative of Benjamin Franklin. Williams accepted Jefferson's appointment to the rank of Colonel and arrived to assume his post on 14 Dec 1801.
Early years.
The first graduates of the academy were Joseph Gardner Swift and Simeon Magruder Levy, who graduated on 12 October 1802. Swift would later return as Superintendent from 1812–1814. Alden Partridge, an 1806 graduate, served as Professor of Mathematics and Engineering, and was Acting Superintendent on occasions from 1808 to 1813. Partridge served as Superintendent from 1814 to 1817, and was responsible for selecting the gray uniforms students still wear today. The early years of the academy were a tumultuous time, with few standards for admission or length of study. Cadets ranged in age from 10 to 37 and attended between 6 months to 6 years. The impending War of 1812 caused Congress to authorize a more formal system of education at the academy, and increased the size of the Corps of Cadets to 250. By the War of 1812, only 89 officers had graduated, morale was low, and the Academy was in danger of being disbanded. 1811 graduate George Ronan, assigned to duty at Fort Dearborn on the American frontier, was killed in the War of 1812 and became the first member of the Corps of Cadets to die in combat. Alden Partridge was accused of lax management and resigned his commission in 1818, unhappy at turning the Superintendent's position over to Sylvanus Thayer, who had been one of Partridge's students. Partridge went on to found Norwich University.
After Thayer until the war with Mexico.
After the tenure of Thayer, the Academy faced challenges to its relevance as many new Western State congressmen saw it as a breeding ground for an elitist aristocratic Officer Corps. The War with Mexico, 1846–1848, changed the nation's perception of the Academy. Because of the Army's slow promotion system of the time, no graduate of the Academy had made General Officer rank at the start of the war. However, many junior and mid-level officer graduates proved themselves invaluable in battle. Generals Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee first distinguished themselves in battle in Mexico. In all 452 of 523 West Point graduates who served in the war received battlefield promotions or awards for bravery.
Post Civil War until Spanish American War.
The years immediately following the American Civil War war a difficult time for the Academy as it struggled to admit and reintegrate cadets from former Confederate states. The first cadets from Southern states were re-admitted in 1868, and 1870 saw the admission of the first African-American cadet, James Webster Smith of South Carolina. Smith did not graduate, so Henry O. Flipper of Georgia become the first African-American Graduate in 1877, graduating 50th of a class of 77. In the 35 years between the Civil War and 1900, the Academy admitted 12 African American cadets, with three graduating. Despite the low graduation rate, that fact that West Point admitted African-American cadets at all was unusual and progressive for the country as a whole during this time. The post Civil War Era also saw a shift in the Academy's curriculum from being very focused upon engineering to a more broad education. The control of the Academy was changed from the Corps of Engineers to the Secretary of War, and for the first time, Superintendents were not from the Engineer Branch. As the "Gilded Age" saw a blossoming of liberal arts education in the private sector, West Point struggled to adapt and change its engineering-heavy curriculum to match the times. 1875, Willard Young, son of Mormon leader and pioneer, Brigham Young, became the first Latter-day Saint to graduate. Other more notable graduates during this period were George Washington Goethals from the Class of 1880 and John J. Pershing from the Class of 1886. Goethals would gain notoriety as the chief engineer of the Panama Canal and Pershing would become famous for chasing the famed Pancho Villa on the Mexican border and for leading American Forces during World War I. The outbreaks of the Spanish–American War and the Philippine–American War saw the classes of 1899 and 1901 graduate early, the first such classes to do so.
Academy Coat of Arms.
Designed in 1898 by professors Larned, Bass, and Tillman, the original design was nearly identical to the current, but was oriented to the right. In 1923, the coat of arms was oriented to the left to conform to more traditional conventions of heraldry. Some of the older buildings on post still bear the original, right-oriented version. The shield is topped by the American Bald Eagle and the Academy's motto of "Duty, Honor, Country" and "West Point MDCCCII USMA" which is the date of USMA's founding. The helmet is that of Pallas Athena, for centuries a symbol of wisdom and learning. The sword is a traditional emblem of the military.

Stuart Beavon (footballer born 1984)

Stuart Leigh Beavon (born 5 May 1984) is an English footballer who plays for Preston North End as a striker.
Career.
Born in Reading, Berkshire, Beavon started his career at Ipswich Town before playing Hellenic League football for Ardley United as a 16-year old when he was transferred to Combined Counties side Wallingford in 2004.
Didcot Town.
Beavon, along with a number of his Wallingford team-mates, transferred to local rivals Didcot Town for the start of season 2004–05 and it was during his time with the Railwaymen that he began to attract the attention of numerous professional clubs. He scored two goals in Didcot's FA Vase triumph at White Hart Lane against AFC Sudbury in May 2005. He scored 40 goals the following season as Didcot lifted the Hellenic League Premier Division title.
Weymouth.
His fine form continued in the Southern League South & West Division and in January 2007 he was signed by Conference Weymouth on a free transfer.
Wycombe Wanderers.
Beavon signed for League Two team Wycombe Wanderers on loan until the end of the 2008–09 season on 19 February 2009, with the option of him signing permanently at the end of the season. Wycombe took this option up after their promotion to League One, and Beavon scored his first goal for the club in his first league start as part of a 1–1 away draw with Hartlepool United. He then proceeded to score a further 2 goals making 14 starts and 11 substitute appearances in a season that ultimately ended in relegation for Wycombe.
His contract was extended by for a further year and played a key role in Wycombe's promotion in the 2010–11 season, by supporting top goal-scorer Scott Rendell.
Again his contract was renewed and he was the only player to be offered a two-year deal seeing him through to the end of the 2012–13 season. After a slow start to the season, scoring a hat-trick in the Football League Trophy but none in the league he gathered goalscoring momentum with his first league goal in a 1–0 win over Sheffield United. This was part of a run of four goals in seven games. He then took another month to get his next goal however managed to score three in two against Milton Keynes Dons and Chesterfield. Two goals against Rochdale took him to nine league goals for the season. After another three games without a goal he scored his 10th of the season against Yeovil Town before notching his 11th and 12th in a 5–0 win over Hartlepool United. He eventually finished the season with 21 league goals, putting him fourth in the League One top goalscorers table (despite the fact he played for side which was relegated).
He scored his final goal for Wycombe Wanderers on 18 August 2012, in a 3–1 victory away at York City.
Preston North End.
During the summer, there was much transfer speculation about a possible move to Preston for Beavon. When the season began, interest in the striker died down slightly due to the fact that Wycombe felt their valuation of the player was not being met by Preston's offers. Westley finally succeeded in signing Beavon on 31 August 2012 (transfer deadline day) and Beavon agreed a two-year contract.
He made an instant impact at the club by scoring in his first match for Preston, a 4–1 win over Swindon Town. On 17 December 2013, Beavon extended his contract with Preston for a further twelve months, thus keeping him at the club until the summer of 2015.
Personal life.
He is the son of former Reading midfielder Stuart Beavon, and grandson of former Oxford United defender Cyril Beavon.

A blog rally is the simultaneous presentation of identical or similar material on numerous blogs, for the purpose of engaging large numbers of readers and/or persuading them to adopt a certain position or take a certain action. The simultaneous nature of a blog rally can create the result of joining the efforts of otherwise independent bloggers for an agreed-upon purpose. Blog Action Day can be likened to a blog rally.
The first recorded definition and use of a blog rally occurring from November 26 through November 30, 2008, in support of a viral movement called 'Engage with Grace: The One Slide Project' was organized to encourage families to discuss end-of-life care issues while gathered together for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. This blog rally was repeated in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.
Another blog rally occurred in April 2009, when a group of bloggers in the Boston area banded together in support of the "Boston Globe", which was threatened with closure by its owner, The New York Times Company. Over two dozen bloggers simultaneously published a post asking readers to submit suggestions on ways the "Globe" could improve its financial position. Later that month, another blog rally emerged in support of an imprisoned Iranian writer, Roxana Saberi.
Another blog rally occurred on June 22, 2009, when thought leaders across healthcare collaborated to launch HealthDataRights.org and unveiled a shared statement to ensure patients’ rights to access and share their own health information. A blog rally supported the introduction of the Declaration of Health Data Rights.

Rotational Brownian motion

Rotational Brownian motion is the random change in the orientation of a polar molecule due to collisions with other molecules. It is an important element of theories of dielectric materials. 
The polarization of a dielectric material is a competition between torques due to the imposed electric field, which tend to align the molecules, and collisions, which tend to destroy the alignment. The theory of rotational Brownian motion allows one to calculate the net result of these two competing effects, and to predict how the permittivity of a dielectric material depends on the strength and frequency of the imposed electric field. 
Rotational Brownian motion was first discussed by Peter Debye, who applied Einstein's theory of translational Brownian motion to the rotation of molecules having permanent electric dipoles. Debye ignored inertial effects and assumed that the molecules were spherical, with an intrinsic, fixed dipole moment. He derived expressions for the dielectric relaxation time and for the permittivity. These formulae have been successfully applied to many materials. However, Debye's expression for the permittivity predicts that the absorption tends toward a constant value when the frequency of the applied electric field becomes very large—the "Debye plateau". This is not observed; instead, the absorption tends toward a maximum and then declines with increasing frequency.
The breakdown in Debye's theory in these regimes can be corrected by including inertial effects; allowing the molecules to be non-spherical; including dipole-dipole interactions between molecules; etc. These are computationally very difficult problems and rotational Brownian motion is a topic of much current research interest.

Gaozhou

Gaozhou () is a county-level city of Maoming City, southwestern Guangdong province of Southern China. It has a population of 1.68 million as of 2008 and total area of 3276 km². The locals speak a variation of the Gaozhou dialect. It is best known for being the ancestral home of Leo Ku.
Administration.
Administratively, Gaozhou City is under the jurisdiction of Maoming. It is a historically important city in Guangdong. It was set up as a city in 1993. Gaozhou consists of five districts (Panzhou, Shanmei, Baoguang, Shizailing, and Jinshan) and another 23 towns.
Geography.
Gaozhou City is located 420 km away from Shenzhen and Guangzhou, 450 km away from Hong Kong.
Gaozhou is a small town located around 400 kilometres away from Guangzhou, China and can be reached by car in four to five hours. Gaozhou is a small town and part of the Maoming prefecture. It stands as an important centre for education and culture for the people of the countryside around the town.
Life in Gaozhou is idyllic, with the main buzz of activity emanating from the several school campuses housing thousands of students from the areas surrounding this town. While the city itself is quite dull and unattractive, the countryside around Gaozhou boasts of lush green fields, scenic hills blanketed with lychee and longan orchards and visions of farmers ploughing their fields, all adding up to an ideal rural getaway. Life here is different from big cities like Guangzhou in the sense that the lives of people here revolve around a good family life, frequent socialising, an emphasis on education and sports. For entertainment, people here frequent KTV bars, or drive up to Maoming, a bigger town located 60 kilometres from here. Though people here like socialising over food, there are no good restaurants save for a "dhaba" style thatched roof restaurant on the outskirts of the town.
Gaozhou has few important landmarks and most places do not even have a mailing address. However the prominent landmark is the Gaozhou middle school, home to over 10000 students who are all mostly from Gaozhou and the surrounding small towns and villages. The school is set in the midst of picturesque hills and is well equipped with a boarding school, sports facilities, a dining hall, and classrooms with computers, projectors and sound systems. The school was founded more than a hundred years ago and over the years has developed into one of the finest schools in Guangdong. Extreme care is taken to ensure the well being of the student and to guarantee success in the school examinations. While to most day scholars, the routine may sound daunting and almost prison like, for the average Gaozhou student though the routine hardly seems a bother, so much so that some even enjoy the cold showers and the relentless pressure to excel in studies.
What might be of interest to the gastronomer or the rural tourist are the lychee and longan farms located in and around Gaozhou that have garnered special attention to become tourist destinations. The fruits also find place on the food shelves of Carrefour supermarkets around Guangdong, thanks to the co-operative farming initiatives between the local government and the French chain. The season for lychees is between the months of May and June, when one can easily find hundreds of vendors plying their wares on the sides of the highway that connects Gaozhou to Guangzhou. Lychees are also an important means of socialising as families bring back different varieties of lychees from their individual farms every week and exchange them with other families in the town, thus reinforcing old bonds and forming new ones.
At first sight, life in Gaozhou is like a still photograph waiting for new character. But the picture slowly gains colour and movement as one spends time here and it is easy to fall in love with this quaint little town.

Dan Raven

Dan Raven is an American crime drama starring Skip Homeier which aired on NBC between January 23, 1960, and January 6, 1961. The setting of the series is the famous Sunset Strip of West Hollywood, California. The series focuses on activities of the sheriff's department, including those of the fictitious Lieutenant Dan Raven and his assistant, Sergeant Burke, played by Dan Barton. Quinn K. Redeker appeared as photographer Perry Levitt. The program aired for a half-hour from January 1960 until September 23, when it expanded for thirteen hour-long segments.
"Dan Raven" featured contemporary celebrities appearing as themselves, including Buddy Hackett, Paul Anka, Marty Ingels, Bob Crewe, and Bobby Darin. Darin appeared in the first of the hour-long episodes, "The High Cost of Fame".
The long-running "77 Sunset Strip" ran on ABC at 9 p.m. Eastern on the same Friday evenings as "Dan Raven", which started at 7:30. "Dan Raven", in the hour format, faced difficult opposition from the second season of CBS Western series "Rawhide" starring Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood. Its competition on ABC was the sitcom "Harrigan and Son", starring Pat O'Brien and Roger Perry.
Other selected episodes include:
"Dan Raven" was replaced on January 13, 1961, by the return of the Ronnie Burns's "Happy".

Nuclear medicine physician

Nuclear Medicine Physicians are medical specialists that use tracers, usually radiopharmaceuticals, for diagnosis and therapy. Nuclear medicine procedures are the major clinical applications of molecular imaging and molecular therapy. In the United States, nuclear medicine physicians are certified by the American Board of Nuclear Medicine and the American Osteopathic Board of Nuclear Medicine.
History.
In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity. It was only a little over a quarter of a century (1925) until the first radioactive tracer study in animals was performed by George de Hevesy, and the next year (1926) the first diagnostic tracer study in humans was performed by Herman Blumgart and Otto Yens.
Some of the earliest applications of radioisotopes were therapy of hematologic malignancies and therapy of both benign and malignant thyroid disease. In the 1950s radioimmunoassay was developed by Solomon Berson and Rosalyn Yalow. Dr. Yalow was co-winner of the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Dr. Berson had already died so was not eligible). Radioimmunoassay was used extensively in clinical medicine but more recently has been largely replaced by non-radioactive methods.
In 1950, human imaging of both gamma and positron emitting radioisotopes was performed. Benedict Cassen's work with a directional probe lead to the development of the first imaging with a rectilinear scanner. Gordon Brownell developed the first positron scanner. In the same decade (1954) the Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) was organized in Spokane, Washington (USA), and (1958) Hal Anger developed the gamma scintillation camera, which could image a whole region at the same time.
Initial introduction of radioisotopes into medicine required individuals to acquire of a considerable background information which was foreign to their medical training. Often a particular application drove the introduction of radioisotopes into a health care facility. As other applications developed the physician or group that had developed knowledge of and experience with radioisotopes usually provided the new service. Consequently, the radioisotope service found homes in several established specialties – commonly in radiology due to an interest in imaging, in pathology (clinical pathology) due to an interest in radioimmunoassay, and in endocrinology due to the early application of 131I to thyroid disease.
Nuclear medicine became widespread and there was a need to develop a new specialty. In the United States, the American Board of Nuclear Medicine was formed in 1972. At that time, the specialty include all of the uses of radioisotopes in medicine – radioimmunoassay, diagnostic imaging, and therapy. As use of and experience with radioisotopes became more widespread in medicine, radioimmunoassay generally transferred from nuclear medicine to clinical pathology. Today, nuclear medicine is based on the use of the tracer principle applied to diagnostic imaging and therapy.
Training.
In the United States, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists (AOABOS accredit nuclear medicine residency programs, and the American Board of Nuclear Medicine (ABNM) and the American Osteopathic Board of Nuclear Medicine certify nuclear medicine physicians. After completing medical school, a post-graduate clinical year is followed by three years of nuclear medicine residency. A common alternate path for physicians who have completed a radiology residency is a one year residency in nuclear medicine, leading to sub-specialty certification by the American Board of Radiology. A less common path for physicians who have completed another residency is a two year residency in nuclear medicine.
Other professionals.
Nuclear medicine procedures are performed by nuclear medicine technologists, who require extensive training both in underlying principles (physics, instrumentation) but also in the clinical applications. Nursing support, especially in the hospital setting, is valuable, but may be shared with other services. Nuclear medicine is a technology embedded specialty depending upon a large number of non-physician professional, including medical physicists, health physicists, radiobiologists, radiochemists, and radiopharmacists.
Residency trained nuclear medicine physicians have the most extensive training and highest level of certification, including all aspects of diagnosis and radionuclide therapy. However, current U.S. regulations do not prohibit other physicians from interpreting nuclear medicine studies and perform radionuclide therapy. Radiologists who are not sub-specialty trained in the specialty, nonetheless often limit their practice to practicing nuclear medicine. Some cardiologists, especially non-invasive cardiologists, will interpret diagnostic cardiology studies including nuclear medicine studies. Radiation oncologists perform all forms of radiation therapy, sometimes including radionuclide therapy. Some endocrinologists treat hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer with 131I. The mix of physicians rendering nuclear medicine services varies both between different countries and within a single country.

He was born in Nuremberg, where he appears to have spent his whole life in various organists' posts. He may have studied with J.S. Bach in Weimar (1716–1717), and his compositions reveal points of contact with Bach. They include a concerto for harpsichord solo, perhaps modelled on the "Italian Concerto"; this solo concerto was once thought to be by Bach; an early version of the slow movement was entered in the first edition of Schmieder's catalog as BWV897:1.

Constitutional Club

The Constitutional Club was a London gentlemen's club, now dissolved, which was established in 1883 and was disbanded in 1979. Between 1886 and 1959 it had a distinctive red and yellow Victorian Neo-Gothic terracotta building at 28 Northumberland Avenue, off Trafalgar Square.
The Club was closely aligned to the Conservative party, with members having to pledge support. The club was founded in anticipation of imminent franchise reform then being debated in parliament, which was eventually realised as the Representation of the People Act 1884. It was anticipated that as many more Conservative supporters would be given the vote, many would want to belong to a Conservative club. Existing Conservative clubs like the Carlton and the Junior Carlton feared that they would become inundated with membership applications from the new voters, so the Constitutional Club was founded with these new electors in mind. (The National Liberal Club, just around the corner from the Constitutional Club, was founded in 1882 with the same purpose in mind for the Liberal party, as the existing Liberal clubs, the Reform and the Devonshire, had been similarly oversubscribed.) The Constitutional Club's membership was originally limited to 6,500.
Despite being avowedly non-political, P.G. Wodehouse was a member of the Constitutional Club, and was reputed to have considered it his favourite London club. Seven of his stories describe a fictitious "Senior Conservative Club" in Northumberland Avenue, with a similar décor to the Constitutional, and which also features a Turkish bath, just like the Turkish bath found next door to the Constitutional. These books are "Psmith in the City", "Something Fresh", "Leave it to Psmith" (where the club is said to have 6,111 members), "Pig-hoo-o-o-o-ey", "Full Moon", "A Tithe for Charity", and "Pearls, Girls and Monty Bodkin" (which establishes its Northumberland Avenue address).
Like many other London clubs, the Constitutional experienced severe financial difficulties with the passing years. In 1959, they agreed to the demolition of the club's well-known, purpose-built terracotta premises, and its replacement with a new office-style building, which was completed in 1962 - this is the building which still stands on that site today, on the corner of Northumberland venue and Northumberland Street, opposite the Sherlock Holmes pub.
Between 1962 and 1964 the club occupied rooms in first the Junior Carlton Club and then the United Service Club, before acquiring premises of its own on St. James's Street. By the mid-1970s its membership had dwindled to only 1,000, and its financial predicament was serious enough that it had to close in 1979, with its remaining members merging with the St Stephen's Club.

<doc id="20793529" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20793529" title="KiteGen">
KiteGen

History.
The KiteGen was originally conceived by Massimo Ippolito, an Italian researcher. Looking at the kite surfers he noticed the large amount of energy that the kite was able to collect and thought that a similar system could produce electricity. This idea seemed to Ippolito so risky that he put it aside for some years.
KiteGen structure.
The problem of "capturing" the wind is solved by the use of Power Wing Profiles (Power kites) whose movements are controlled automatically by a computer. Through cables the kites are anchored to a structure that rotates, generating electricity. This structure is the turbine of the high altitude wind farm while the kites are the "blades" of the turbine.
The kites are flown on a predetermined trajectory, that can transform the exerted force on the cable, to an overall mechanical torque which rotates the vertical axis turbine. About twenty automatically controlled kites can keep rotating a turbine of 1,600 meters diameter at a speed of 15 revolutions per hour. This can generate 1 Gigawatt of power, equivalent to a medium size nuclear power station but with an estimated capital cost 10 times lower. In other words 1 cubic Km of sky is able to provide 1 GigaWatt of power for 80% of the time in a year.
The kites extra added benefit lies in the fact that the length of cables allows them to reach heights over 500 meters, where the high altitude wind flows, without introducing structural weaknesses.
Winds of high altitude.
There are two wind flow bands that envelope the Earth globe. One passes over the southern hemisphere at the latitude of Patagonia, while the other passes over the northern hemisphere, over Europe. The flow height ranges from 800 meters up to 10,000 meters of altitude, while the width is 4,000 or 5,000 km. The average power of the wind is about 2 kW per square meter.
High altitude wind is much more powerful and constant when compared to that at earth level, which is intense in very few places, and at full speed for only about 1,700-1,800 hours per year, which limits the annual production of energy.
The wind which is planned to be used is around 800 meters height with average speeds of 7 m/s and specific power of 200 W/mformula_1. For example, a section of wind width of 1,000 meters at an altitude between 600 and 1,000 meters has a power equal to 400*1000*200 = 80 MW.
The conceptual prototype in the Province of Asti which would work with nine generators and up to 10,000 m alitude would generate a peak power of 27 MW.
A park of Kitegens with 100 MW peak power should produce 500 GWh/year; enough for 86,000 households
The Kitegen can generate about 6000 hours / year.
Funding.
In June 2006 the Kitegen had been selected to receive public financing from the Italian Ministry for Economic Development. Although the project received a "priority B" score the procedure evaluation was not carried out because of lack of funds. Economic capital, performance evaluation, and capital adequacy is proceeding from evaluator agency (Sanpaolo-Intesa Bank).
Under the 7th Framework Program of the European Union, an elaboration of the project within the transport sector was rated "excellent" and received funding of €3 million for the realization of solutions based on wing profiles for the generation of electricity aboard ships, traction and management of ancillary services (proposal No. 218,691; acronym: "KitVes"). In November 2008, European Union informed that provision of funds will start "soon".
Mobilegen.
In August 2006 a prototype of the KiteGen named mobilegen was first tested. This truck mounted system is mobile and uses low-altitude wind. A mobile generator of second generation was tested in September 2007 at Francesco Cappa airport located in Casale Monferrato (Province of Alessandria, Italy). The unit called KSU1 used a kite that flew to 800 meters with automatic controls. The experiments lasted three days and required special permits from civil and military aviation.
Aluminium smelter.
In September 2012 KiteGen sent an offer to Italian Government to relieve the aluminium smelter in Portovesme from ALCOA and run it with his wind capturing technologies. Actually the plant is the biggest energy user in Italy with 2.3 Twh/year, so KiteGen think that a farm of 200 generators in only 1 square kilometer near the plant would be able to draw 300 MW of power with a year availability of 5000 hours. All expenses for construction can be write off in nearly 2 years with energy costs around 30 €/Mwh. For comparison Glencore offer for the smelter want to relieve it only if the energy costs can drop to 37 €/Mwh by state aids because high power costs of nearby Sulcis Coal Power Station (around 70 €/Mwh) are the main reason for ALCOA to leave Sardinia.

HM Prison Nottingham

HM Prison Nottingham is a Category B men's prison, located in the Sherwood area4 of Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England. The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service.
History.
The history of the prison stretches back to 1890, when it opened as a city gaol. Rebuilt in 1912, it became a closed training establishment for adult males, a role it continued through 1997. Since then, it has received prisoners from the courts of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire as a category B local prison.
In 1999, the Home Office announced that Nottingham Prison was to serve as a pilot project of a potentially national plan to track paedophiles and other high risk offenders after their release from their sentence by providing them housing in flats on prison sites. A dozen local residents staged protests in opposition. 
In October 2004, a voluntary drug testing scheme established at Nottingham Prison was "hailed as a success". Participants in the scheme underwent intensive drug therapy, with prisoners who remained drug-free offered the opportunity of early release from their sentences.
In July 2004, the Independent Monitoring Board published a report which called for the worn-out Victorian wing of Nottingham Prison to be closed and urgently refurbished, as it "was becoming totally unsuitable for accommodating anybody - especially in winter when...in the building could be as cold as 10°C". Soon after this the prison wing was closed down. In June 2008, it was announced that Nottingham would undergo major re-construction that would double the size of the prison. The £95 million facelift should see the condemned Victorian wing demolished and new accommodation and facilities built in its place. The project is expected to be completed in Summer 2010.
The prison today.
Nottingham is a Category B local prison, holding convicted and remand adult males from the local courts in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.
The prison provides education, workshop places and domestic duties to occupy inmates. Community projects at the prison include regular visits by local children with special needs.
Resettlement services at Nottingham offer advice on housing and debt management, as well as assistance with employment. There is also a Listeners Scheme for those prisoners who are considered to be at risk from suicide or self-harm.

Emerging Pathogens Institute

The Emerging Pathogens Institute is an interdisciplinary research institution associated with the University of Florida. The Institute is charged with fusing key disciplines to develop outreach, education, and research capabilities designed to preserve the region's health and economy, and to prevent or contain new and re-emerging diseases.
History.
The idea of this Institute was first created by the University of Florida faculty & researchers. They began designing the framework for the Emerging Pathogens Institute back in 2006. Since then, the university has secured funding from the state of Florida for a facility that is estimated to cost $56 million. The structure will house the institute and numerous top researchers. EPI has several dedicated researchers, but is primarily composed of a consortium of researchers spanning nine colleges at UF: Medicine; Pharmacy; Dentistry; Public Health and Health Professions; Veterinary Medicine; Liberal Arts and Sciences; Engineering; Nursing; and Agricultural and Life Sciences.
In March 2009, the Institute received a substantial grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This was the first time that the University of Florida has ever received direct funding from this foundation, and the grant was provided to help researchers develop tools to fight malaria.

Gloeocapsa magma

Gloeocapsa magma is a species of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria are an ancient line of photosynthesizing bacteria, which photolyze water generating oxygen gas. Ancient cyanobacteria were ancestral to the chloroplasts of all plants on earth. "Gloeocapsa magma" has gained notoriety in the Southeastern United States, but, it is also spreading throughout the Midwest. This particular type of cyanobacteria is responsible for creating black stains and streaks on roofs. The bacteria accumulate over time as it feeds on moisture and calcium carbonate. This accumulation begins to show the black stains as the cyanobacteria develop their dark and hard UV-protective outer coating.
The main reasons for the rapid spread and noticeability of these cyanobacteria are thought to be:
1. Rising humidity and temperatures combined with more and more bacteria spores promotes their spread with these favorable conditions.
2. Fiberglass shingles (the most commonly seen amongst today's residential homes) are made with limestone as a filler (in the asphalt). These shingles hold moisture and organic "bacteria food" material longer (especially on the North-side in the Midwest) than the paper/asphalt/ceramic shingles of 20+ years ago. Additionally, these particular bacteria enjoy the limestone as a food source.
Once the bacteria have become noticeable, the stains will continue to worsen year to year. There is debate over the actual harmfulness of this particular bacteria to roofs, as there is little supportive scientific research. However, most "experts" within the subject area conclude the bacteria to be harmful, if left untreated, as the growth holds moisture within shingles causing premature aging, rotting, and/or granule loss.
Note: "Gloeocapsa magma" may resemble "algae" in that they are green, but in fact cyanobacteria are bacteria whereas algae are single-celled eukaryotes (cells with nuclei) that are closely related to plants.

Miss Asia Pacific 2005

Miss Asia Pacific International 2005, the 36th Miss Asia Pacific International was held on the city of Guangzhou, China with the participation of 53 countries from all over the world.
Controversy.
During the Miss Asia Pacific 2005 pageants final dress rehearsal, Miss Jamaica, Daisi Pollard was escorted off the stage at the MAPI pageant rehearsal after protesting irregularities. Apparently, the delegates had been told that the rehearsal would just be a "run through" and so many of them declined to wear makeup. However, when they hit the stage, they realized that the rehearsal was being taped for television, and judges were present at the rehearsal. Many of the delegates felt uncomfortable about the situation because they were not at their best, but instead of protesting they complained backstage. However, Miss Jamaica decided to take matters into her own hands and she interrupted the taping by walking across the stage to the microphone and loudly protesting. She was immediately escorted off stage. The judges were eventually removed from the rehearsal.
There were several developments at MAPI that left the delegates unhappy. The decision to cut from 52 to 5 finalists did not go down well. Many of the delegates wept when they heard the news. There was also confusion over whether evening gown or costume would be judged toward the final score. The Chinese were saying costume would be judged but the Filipinos were saying evening gown would be judged. The delegates never went on stage individually in their evening gowns but only in groups of eight and then it was announced who won the award. MAPI had agreed to pay the airline costs and accommodations for the delegates but MAPI failed to purchase tickets for certain delegates due to MAPI not properly informing its national directors of a visa deadline.

Celebrity Says!

Celebrity Says! is a game show that premiered in early 2008 on the TV Guide Channel, created by Michael Krupat and hosted by Dave Holmes. On each episode, three contestants guess what celebrities say from footage taken of interviews for the TV Guide Channel.
Round 1 (Red Carpet Hustle).
In round 1, video footage of a celebrity interview taken during Red Carpet premieres are shown. After the video stops, Dave reads off three choices as to what the celebrity might've said, and the contestants lock in their answers. The video resumes playing, and if the contestant (or contestants) match the celebrity's quote, they earn 100 points. There is no penalty for a wrong answer (throughout the whole show, not just this round)
Round 2 (Who Said That?).
Played like round 1, except Dave reads off a quote, and the contestants have to guess which of three celebrities said that in an interview for TV Guide Channel. Correct answers earn 200 points.
Round 3 (Speed Round).
A typical speed round, with 90 seconds worth of triple-choice questions, each worth 300 points. Players must wait until the entire question is finished (including the choices) before buzzing in, and only two players may attempt each question. When time runs out, the contestant with the highest score wins the game and plays the "Starmageddon" round for $5,000. If the game ends in a tie, whether it be between two players in the lead or all three, Dave reads one last question, and the first to ring in gets to answer, and if correct, wins the game.
Round 4 (Starmageddon).
The contestant is asked five dual-choice questions about one celebrity, the last one always being to figure out what the celebrity said in an interview for TV Guide Channel. After the player answers all five questions, the results are revealed. The contestant wins $200 for each correct answer; if the contestant can answer all five answers correctly, he or she wins $5,000.

Calum MacDonald (musician)

Calum Macdonald (Scottish Gaelic: Calum MacDhomhnaill; born 12 November 1953, Lochmaddy, North Uist) is the percussionist of the Scottish Celtic rock band Runrig, as well as their primary songwriter with his older brother, Rory MacDonald. Rory tends to write the melody, and Calum the lyrics. Since former lead singer Donnie Munro left the band in 1997, Rory has taken lead vocal duties on songs in the band's catalogue written in the Scots Gaelic language, as the band's new lead singer, Bruce Guthro, is not a Gaelic speaker.
Macdonald previously attended Jordanhill College and worked as a P.E. teacher until Runrig went 'professional'.
Early life.
His brother Rory was born in Dornoch, Sutherland. His father, Donald John MacDonald of Scalpay, was a World War II veteran. The family moved to North Uist, when Rory was about four years old. On arrival in Lochmaddy, Calum was born.
When the time came for Rory to attend High School, which at the time was situated in Portree, on the Isle of Skye, the whole family moved en masse. It was in Skye that the brothers formed Runrig along with Blair Douglas and subsequently Donnie Munro.
Later life.
During the 1980s, Calum's Christian faith deepened and this influence began to be felt in his lyrical content, in both Gaelic and English. Calum was based in Edinburgh for the 1980s and early 1990s before re-locating his young family to Contin in the Highlands. He has contributed main, if not lead, vocals to a handful of Runrig tunes, including "Dust" and "Faileas air an Airigh".
His son, Donald MacDonald, is also a songwriter and performer and has his own band Donald MacDonald & the Islands.

He graduated through the Sheffield Wednesday Academy and reserve teams, making his first team debut on 20 December 2008, aged 17 years and 82 days. He has also played for the England Schoolboy team.Modest was called up to the Sheffield Wednesday first team squad for the home match against Bristol City on 13 December 2008 as the team suffered an injury crisis. He was a non-playing substitute for the eventual goalless draw. However, Modest went on to make his debut for Sheffield Wednesday a week later on 20 December, when he started in the 2–0 loss away to Cardiff City. Modest was then a second half substitute in the home game versus Blackpool on 26 December 2008.

Fabre was born in Orléans, studied at the "École polytechnique" and the French National School of Forestry in Nancy, from which he graduated in 1868. From 1868-1875 he served as Guard General of Water and Forests in Dijon, then in Mende, after which he was named sub-inspector, then inspector, at Alès. As Gard's reforestation director until 1900, his major achievement was the development of the "Forêt Domaniale de l'Aigoual" and establishment of the meteorological observatory on its summit. In 1900 he was appointed curator of Forestry in Nîmes, which post he held until his retirement in 1909.
He died in 1911 in Nîmes.
Today the "Forêt Domaniale de l'Aigoual" extends across about 15,000 hectares, of which 11,000 are in Gard and the remainder in Lozère.

Unionist Club

The Unionist Club was a short-lived London gentlemen's club, now dissolved, which was established in 1886, and had wound up by 1892. For the last four years of its existence, it had a clubhouse at 66-68 Pall Mall.
The club was formed shortly after the mass defection of scores of Liberal MPs and Peers over the First Home Rule Bill, to create the new Liberal Unionist party. The new party went into an immediate alliance with the Conservatives, but remained a separate body until 1912. Because of this, many Liberal Unionist politicians found they were not wholly welcome in established Conservative clubs like the Carlton, but were equally shunned in traditionally Liberal clubs like the Reform.
Consequently, the club was set up for Liberal Unionists, and moved to its Pall Mall clubhouse in 1888. The Clubhouse had originally been built for the short-lived Junior Naval and Military Club in 1875, which accumulated so much debt over the building that it went bankrupt in 1879. The premises were then taken over by a Conservative club, the Beaconsfield between 1880 and 1887.
The Unionist Club always suffered from limited membership, as a great many Liberal Unionists stayed on in their old Liberal clubs, seeing themselves as 'true' Liberals - this is illustrated by an incident in 1912 when Winston Churchill tried to belittle Sir Edward Carson's integrity by saying "The right hon. Gentleman forces me to remind him that he was a member of the National Liberal Club", only to be told by Carson "I was elected as a Unionist."[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1912/oct/10/allocation-of-time#S5CV0042P0-01765]
Heavily in debt, the Unionist Club closed its doors in 1892. The building was eventually taken over by the New Oxford and Cambridge Club, which operated there from 1894 to 1920.[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40605]

Lene Schneider-Kainer

Lene Schneider-Kainer, born Lene Schneider (16 May 1885, Vienna, Austria - 15 June 1971, Cochabamba, Bolivia), was a Jewish-Austrian painter, daughter of the painter Sigmund Schneider, noted for her illustration of ""Lukian:Hetärengespräche. Mit Illustrationen von Lene Schneider-Kainer und einem Nachwort von Sabine Dahmen"".
She started her art studies in Vienna, and continued in Munich, Paris and Amsterdam. During a stay in Paris she met her future husband, Ludwig Kainer, a doctor, painter, graphic designer, poster artist and stage designer from Munich, whom she married in 1910. From about 1911 the couple belonged to a circle of artists and intellectuals that included Arnold Schönberg, Franz Werfel, Herwarth Walden and his wife, Else Lasker-Schüler. Between 1912 and 1926 she lived in Berlin at 78 Niebuhrstraße in Charlottenburg. In 1914/15 Lene produced a strong and expressive oil painting of the poet and playwright Else Lasker-Schüler. 
Schneider-Kainer made her debut as an artist in 1917 with an exhibition of some 50 oil paintings and drawings at the "Galerie Gurlitt", shocking the art world of Berlin. There was an uproar over 30 erotic images, illustrating Wieland's 1788 German translation of the ""Dialogues of the Courtesans (Hetaerae)"" by Lucian.
The artistic highpoint of Schneider-Kainer's career was in the years from 1919 to 1922 with the production of lithographic erotic portfolios with titles such as ""Ten female acts"" and ""Before the Mirror."" In the 1920s Lene Schneider-Kainer became renowned as painter and illustrator, enjoying great acclaim in Berlin and selling her works abroad. 
In 1926 Lene left Berlin after her divorce and for two years accompanied the poet Bernhard Kellermann on an extended odyssey, often by donkey or caravan, visiting Russia, Persia, India, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Tibet, Hongkong and China. In her memoirs, she wrote: 
She painted, photographed and sketched her impressions, and these contributions appeared regularly in the "Berliner Tageblatt". On her return via the Trans-Siberian Railway, she presented a selection of her works from Asia in Berlin, Magdeburg, Stuttgart, Kiel, London and Rome, and produced illustrations for the magazine, ""Die Dame"". She did not return to Germany after a 1932 trip to the Balearic Islands because of the power takeover by the National Socialists. After this she settled on Mallorca, and later on Ibiza, where she started an artists' colony. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she left for New York. Under a pseudonym she published washable fabric children's books.
She had successful exhibitions in Mallorca, Barcelona, Copenhagen, New York and Philadelphia. In 1954 she settled in Bolivia, where she assisted her son in establishing a textile factory producing Native American designs for export to the United States.

Austria–Croatia relations are foreign relations between Austria and Croatia. Until 1918, Croatia was part of Austria–Hungary. Both countries established diplomatic relations on January 15, 1992. Austria has an embassy in Zagreb and 4 honorary consulates (in Dubrovnik, Pula, Rijeka and Split). Croatia has an embassy in Vienna and 2 honorary consulates (in Graz and Innsbruck).
Both countries are full members of the Council of Europe. There are around 131,000 people of Croatian descent living in Austria.
Austro-Croatian relations have been close for most of modern history. Several heroes of Croatian history and culture were of Austrian origin and the country was one of the strongest in favour of recognition and aid after Slovenia and Croatia declared independence in 1991, with the mayor of Vienna and the heads of each of Austria's major parties holding a press conference in Vienna the next morning declaring their solidarity with the cause.

Paradise Syndrome

Paradise Syndrome, while not officially recognized by psychologists as a mental condition, is a term used by some to refer to a condition in which a person suffers a feeling of dissatisfaction despite having achieved all their dreams. The term may have been coined by Dave Stewart. It is often applied to individuals of such great wealth and success that they feel they no longer have anything left in life to accomplish. It is common with people who assign great value to their career and, although they have achieved much, do not feel satisfied.
The phrase may also refer to an episode of "Star Trek", "The Paradise Syndrome", and in this instance, deals with being overworked and needing a break, rather than a feeling of dissatisfaction related to achieving one's dreams.
In popular culture.
The titular character in the Simon and Garfunkel song "Richard Cory" (based on the Edward Arlington Robinson poem of the same title) epitomises Paradise Syndrome.
A major character in the television series Psychoville named Oscar Lomax suffers from Paradise Syndrome. The only way for him to be 'cured' usually involves a topsy-turvy game of cat and mouse with a stuffed 'commodity' (children's toy) which he finds and then deliberately loses.
In Night Train (novel) (1997) by Martin Amis, Paradise Syndrome is proffered as a possible explanation for the suicide of Jennifer Rockwell, a young woman who seemingly had everything: beauty, intelligence, health, a devoted lover and a stimulating career. The investigation of her suicide throws up clues to another explanation that the central character, detective Mike Hoolihan, suspects Jennifer herself may have left as an elaborate decoy.

Croatia–Syria relations are bilateral relations between Croatia and Syria. Both countries established diplomatic relations on 29 August 1997. Croatia is represented in Syria through its embassy in Cairo in Egypt and an honorary consulate in Damascus. Syria is represented in Croatia through its embassy in Budapest in Hungary.
Both countries are full members of the Union for the Mediterranean.
History.
Croatia and Syria signed a treaty establishing bilateral relations between the countries on 29 August 1997. On 18 July 2008, Croatia and Syria signed an agreement on prevention of double taxation; and on 21 December 2008, the countries signed an agreement on air transport.
On 23 February 2012, Croatia's prime minister Zoran Milanović called on Croatian companies to withdraw from Syria due to the violence, following the example of INA Industria Nafte d.d., the Croatian state oil company. He said that companies would be pulled out until a democratic order is implemented in Syria. Deputy prime minister Radimir Čačić said INA's decision to halt operations in Syria brought Croatia in line with EU sanctions against doing business in Syria. Syrian oil minister Sufian al-Alao accused INA for incorrectness towards Syrian people and stated that withdrawal of INA from Syria was a cringe to the European Union, since Croatia is not yet an EU member. Al-Alao also confirmed that INA's return to Syria is impossible because of such matters. Nevertheless, in August, the governor of the Homs Governorate and close associate of Syria's president Bashar al-Assad, Ahmed Munir, called Croatia a Syria's friend and that Ina would be able to return once situation in Syria becomes calm. Croatia suffers damage of hundreds of millions Euros due to the sanction. On 1 April 2012 Croatian Foreign Minister Vesna Pusić attended the summit of the "Friends of Syria" in Istanbul.
Croatia and Syria have active trade exchanges, while Syria exported foodstuffs, vegetables, cotton materials and imports from its chemical materials, oil and gas equipment, and sea products to Croatia.
On 25 February 2013 it was confirmed that a large amount of weapons was sent to the rebels in Syria from Croatia and that the weapons were financed by Saudi Arabia. The cargo arrived in Jordan in December 2012. Nevertheless, Croatian Foreign Ministry and arms-export agency denied the involvement, while the Jordanian authorities refused to give any statement on the matter. On 28 February Croatia's Prime Minister Milanović said that Croatia will withdraw its troops from the Golan Heights that are participating in the UN's peacekeeping mission because of the article published in the New York Times about the Croatia's involvement in aiding the rebels in Syria.
State visits.
On 21 December 2008, Croatia's president Stjepan Mesić visited Syria's president Bashar al-Assad in Damascu on Assad's invitation. The presidents discussed Croatian–Syria economic cooperation and the situation in the Middle East.
On 28 October 2009, Syria's President Bashar al-Assad visited Mesić in Zagreb. He announced that purpouse of his visit is to improve the relations between the countries. Mesić expressed his wishes for better economic cooperation between Croatia and Syria and said that Croatia's entry to the European Union would not be an obstacle to their relations. He also added that Croatia did not use all of its business opportunities in cooperation with Syria. The presidents discussed the situation at the Middle East as well. Assad is the first Syrian president to visit Croatia.
On 29 October, Mesić suggested that Israeli and Syrian representatives should have a meeting at Croatian island of Brijuni. Mesić said that he has a close conntact with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and that he is holding frequent talks with him on improvement of the relationship between Croatia and Syria. He described Assad as serious" and "intelligent" leader and he supported return of the Golan Heights back to Syria. Mesić's proposal came after he met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and president Shimon Peres a week before.

Italy–Libya relations

Italy–Libya relations are foreign relations between Italy and Libya. Italy has an embassy in Tripoli and a general consulate in Benghazi. Libya has an embassy in Rome and 2 general consulates (in Milan and Palermo).
History.
Between 1911 and 1947, what is now Libya was an Italian colony. Both countries established diplomatic relations in 1947.
In 1970, Libya expelled all Italians from Libya and confiscated their possessions.
While Libya was considered a pariah by much of the international community under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, Italy maintained diplomatic relations with Libya and exported a significant quantity of its oil from the country. Relations between Italy and Libya warmed in the first decade of the 21st century, when they entered co-operative arrangements to deal with illegal immigration into Italy. Libya agreed to aggressively prevent migrants from sub-Saharan Africa from using the country as a transit route to Italy, in return for foreign aid and Italy's successful attempts to have the European Union lift its trade sanctions on Libya. 
In 2009, Gaddafi visited Italy for the first time in his 40-year rule. However, when Gaddafi faced a civil war in 2011, Italy imposed a freeze on some Libyan assets linked to him and his family, pursuant to a United Nations-sponsored regime. Italy currently recognizes the National Transitional Council as the government of Libya.
On 26 September 2011, Italian energy company Eni announced it had restarted oil production in Libya for the first time since the start of the 2011 Libyan civil war. The quick return of Eni to Libyan oilfields reflected the positive relations between Rome and Tripoli under the NTC.

George C. Royal

George Calvin Royal Jr (born August 5, 1921) is one of the few remaining first-generation African-American microbiologists to receive a Ph.D in the United States and from an Ivy League institution, and was part of one of the few African-American husband-and-wife teams in Science with Gladys W. Royal Ph.D. George C. Royal is currently professor emeritus at Howard University.
Early life.
Royal was born in Williamston, South Carolina, in 1921, the oldest boy of nine children of African-American and Native American descent. His father, George Sr., owned an auto garage there before migrating his family to Urbana, Ohio, during the Great Depression. Dr. Royal has six children: George Calvin Royal III, Geraldine Gynnette Royal, Guericke Christopher Royal, jazz musician Gregory Charles Royal, Michelle Renee McNear, and Eric Marcus Royal.
College and early professional career.
Royal attended Tuskegee Institute from 1939 to 1943, earning a B.S. in Biology before serving in the Army in World War II as a munitions sergeant, ending at the Battle of the Bulge in 1945. After the war, he attended the University of Wisconsin, where he received an M.S. in Microbiology in 1947. Royal took on positions as Bacteriology instructor at Tuskegee in 1947-48; research assistant at Ohio State University and Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station from 1948 to 1952. He was assistant professor of Bacteriology at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College in Greensboro from 1952 to 1955.
Ph.D and beyond.
In 1955 Royal gained admission to the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League institution, where he received his Ph.D in microbiology as a predoctoral fellow in 1957. Dr. Royal was associate and professor of Bacteriology at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College in Greensboro from 1957 to 1965; and in 1959 he served a summer research fellowship for the United States Atomic Energy Commission, Biology Division, at Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies. He was the dean of the Graduate School at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College in Greensboro from 1961 to 1965. Following a postdoctoral study in allergy and hypersensitivity and an assistant professorship in Microbiology at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia from 1965 to 1966, he joined the faculty of Howard University from 1966 to 1993. He became professor emeritus in 1993.
African-American husband - wife team.
Royal married Gladys Geraldine Williams in 1947 while attending the University of Wisconsin. Gladys W. Royal (1926–2001) was an African-American biochemist, who graduated from Dillard University at the age of 18 and would receive her Ph.D from Ohio State University in 1956 by the age of 29- a rare feat for an African-American female in the 1950s. The Royals would collaborate on important research including that funded by the Atomic Energy Commission involving bone marrow transplants to treat radiation overdoses.
African-American husband-and-wife teams in science were extremely rare in the early and mid-20th century due to the social, educational and economic climate regarding African Americans in the United States.
Important research presented.

Rugby career.
Evans was first selected for Wales in 1922 while representing Swansea at club level. Evans first game was against England at the Cardiff Arms Park under the captaincy of Tom Parker. Wales won in style, scoring a then record eight tries. All five Swansea players representing Wales in that match scored, Evans, Parker, Bowen and Palmer all scored tries, and Joe Rees completed two conversions. Evans was back on the scoresheet in his very next match, scoring a very late drop goal to grab a draw against Scotland at Inverleith. Evans scored in both remaining games of the tournament, scoring tries in both wins over Ireland and then France. In the game against France, Evans was not originally chosen to play, but shortly before the kick-off the Welsh selectors dropped Frank Palmer and Harold Davies, and replaced them with Evans and Cliff Richards. Although becoming a Championship winner and scoring in every international game, Evans was not selected to represent Wales after 1922.

Ravindra Kelekar

Ravindra Kelekar (March 25, 1925 – August 27, 2010) was a noted Indian author who wrote primarily in the Konkani language, though he also wrote in Marathi and Hindi. A Gandhian activist, freedom fighter and a pioneer in the modern Konkani movement, he is a well known Konkani scholar, linguist, and creative thinker. Kelkar was a participant in the Indian freedom movement, Goa’s liberation movement, and later the campaign against the merger of the newly formed Goa with Maharashtra. He played a key role in the founding of the "Konkani Bhasha Mandal", which lead the literary campaign for the recognition of Konkani as a full-fledged language, and its reinstatement as the state language of Goa. He authored nearly 100 books in the Konkani language, including "Amchi Bhas Konkaneech", "Shalent Konkani Kityak", "Bahu-bhashik Bharatant Bhashenche Samajshastra" and "Himalayant", and also edited "Jaag" magazine for more than two decades.
Kelekar died at Apollo Hospital at Margao, Goa at around 11.30 am on Friday August 27. He was 85.
His remains were cremated with State honours at his native village of Priol.
Kelekar received the Padma Bhushan (2008),
the Gomant Sharada Award of Kala Academy,
the Sahitya Akademi Award (1976),
and the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship (2007)—the highest award of the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters.
He also received the 2006 Jnanpith Award, the first ever awarded to an author writing in the Konkani language,
which was presented in July 2010.
Early life and education.
Kelekar was born on March 25, 1925, in the city of Cuncolim in South Goa. His father, Dr Rajaram Kelekar, was a physician who later became renowned for his Portuguese translation of the "Bhagwad Gita". While still a student at the Lyceum High School in Panaji, Kelekar joined the Goa liberation movement in 1946. This brought him in close contact with several local and national leaders, including Ram Manohar Lohia, under whose influence he was able to recognize the power of language to mobilize the local populace. Later, he saw the potential in his native Konkani language, which became his lifelong work.
Career.
Already deeply influenced by Gandhian philosophy, in 1949 Kelekar left his native Goa for Wardha, to be with noted Gandhian and writer Kakasaheb Kalelkar. Kelekar stayed under Kalelkar's tutelage until 1955, when he was appointed librarian of the Gandhi Memorial Museum in New Delhi. This turned out to be short-lived, as only a year later he plunged back into the Goa freedom movement. With a mission to reconnect the Goan diaspora all over the world, he started the weekly, "Gomant Bharati" (1956–60),
published in the Latin script in Bombay. Soon after, being an active participant in Goa's struggle for freedom, he was imprisoned by the Portuguese. He was released when the Indian Army invaded and annexed Goa in 1961.
He joined the socio-political campaign against the merger of Goa into the neighbouring Maharashtra state, which ended after the plebiscite of 1967, with Goa retaining its separate identity albeit as a union territory. Goa retained this status until 1987, when it was declared a separate state.
After Goa's independence, Kelekar took to literary activism, in the form of getting his native Konkani language its due status as an independent language, rather than as just a dialect of Marathi. He was compared favorably with pioneers in the Konkani literary movement, such as Shenoi Goembab.
During this period, he wrote some of his most important works promoting the Konkani language, including "Aamchi Bhas Konkanich" (1962), a dialogue revealing the importance of Konkani to the common man on the street; "Shallent Konkani Kityaak" (1962), highlighting the significance of having Konkani medium schools in Goa; and "A Bibliography of Konkani Literature in Devanagari, Roman and Kannada characters" (1963).
In February 1987, the Goa Legislative Assembly had passed the Official Language Bill making Konkani the Official Language of Goa.
The struggle ended in 1992, when Konkani was included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution as an official language.
With life's mission completed, Kelkar retired from public life, focusing mainly of his writing.
On February 26, 1975, the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters, recognized Konkani as an independent language.
The first Sahitya Akademi Award for a work in Konkani was won by Kelekar for his travelogue, "Himalayant", in 1977.
The Akademi's first Translation Award in Konkani also went to Kelekar in 1990 for "Ami Taankan Manshant Haadle", a Konkani translation of a collection of essays in Gujarati, "Mansaeena Diva", by Jhaverchand Meghani.
He received the 2006 Jnanpith Award, which was the first given to a Konkani-language writer. The pinnacle of his career came with the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship for lifetime achievement in 2007. A lifelong proponent of regional languages, in his acceptance speech for the Jnanpith award, he said, "People have stopped reading books in regional languages. On the other hand, through English, we have created Bonsai intellectuals, Bonsai writers and Bonsai readers."
When the Vishwa Konkani Sahitya Academy, an offshoot of the Konkani Language and Cultural Foundation, was set up in 2006, the first work it took up for translation was "Velavaylo Dhulo", a collection of Kelekar's essays.
His books have been translated into Hindi and other North Indian languages, and are used by universities.
Personal life.
Kelekar married Godubai Sardessai in 1949; their son Guirish was born within a year.
Kelekar lived in his ancestral home—built by his father in 1937—called "Kelekar House", in the village of Priol in central Goa. The Casa Dos Kelekars, as it is formally known, is now seen as exemplary of a typical Goan Saraswat Brahmin community home.

Lycoming O-145

The Lycoming O-145 is a family of small, low-horsepower, four-cylinder, air-cooled horizontally opposed aircraft engine produced from 1938 until the late 1940s by Lycoming Engines. The family includes the reduction-geared GO-145.
Design and development.
The O-145 was produced in three major versions, the O-145-A rated at , the -B rated at , and -C rated at . The "B" model was the major production model, with the "A" and "C" produced in much smaller quantities.
All models of the series had the same bore, stroke and displacement, additional horsepower being generated by increasing compression ratio and maximum rpm. All use a Stromberg NA-S2 or NA-S2A or Marvel MA-2 or MA-2-A carburetor. The dual ignition versions use two Scintilla SF-4L, SN4LN-20 or -21, Superior SMA-4 or Edison-Splitdorf RMA-4 magnetos.
The original O-145-A produced at 2300 rpm, weighed and featured single ignition. In an attempt to compete with the Continental A-65 Lycoming boosted the rpm and power output to at 2550 rpm and finally at 3100 rpm. The O-145 had a hard time competing with the same horsepower Continentals due to its smaller displacement, which resulted in a steeper torque curve.
The GO-145 is a geared model, introduced in 1938, that uses a 27:17 reduction ratio (1.59:1) gearbox to produce at 3200 crankshaft rpm, giving 2013 propeller rpm. The engine employs a gearbox bolted to the front of the engine and the resulting engine weighs without starter or generator. The GO-145 suffered from a poor reputation for reliability, because pilots mis-handled the engine, running it at too low a cruising rpm and causing gearbox wear as a result.
The series' type certificate expired on 2 November 1950 and no O-145-B1 or -C1 or GO-145-C1s engines produced after 1 August 1941 and O-145-B2, -B3 or -C2 or GO-145-C2 or -C3s produced after 24 August 1949 are eligible for certification. The single ignition O-145-A series, O-145-B1 and -C1 are not covered by the original type certificate.
Lycoming ended production of the O-145 and replaced it with the O-235 series.

Tennis Napoli Cup

The Tennis Napoli Cup is a professional tennis tournament played on outdoor red clay courts. It is currently part of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Challenger Tour. It is held annually at the Tennis Club Napoli in Naples, Italy, since 1995.
History.
The tournament is the modern iteration of one of the oldest tennis championships in Italy, the Campionato Partenopeo ("Parthenopean Championship"), which for men's singles was first contested in 1905. Over the years the men's tournament has been combined with other trophies, such as Coppa Gordon Bennet (1907–1910 and 1937), Coppa Reale (1912–1915), Coppa del Municipio di Napoli (1926–1938), Campionato dell’Europa Centrale (1937–1938), Coppa Città di Napoli (1953–1970), Coppa Carlo D'Avalos (1970).
At the time of the amateur tennis the Naples tournament gained increasing importance over the years, becoming one of the pivotal events of the spring season of the courts of Europe and a decisive step in preparation for the Internationals of Italy and those of France. Following the affirmation of professionalism, the tournament lost its relevance and disappeared, rising from the mid-1990s and finding a place within the category of ATP Challenger.
The women's tournament (singles and doubles), played simultaneously with the men's tournament until 1970, now no longer takes place.
Venue.
From the beginning, the tournament is played on the courts of the Circolo del Tennis di Napoli, which occupies an area near the ancient "Villa Reale di Chiaia", a few meters from the Gulf of Naples and minutes from downtown and historic centre.

Denmark–Ireland relations

Denmark–Ireland relations refers to the current and historical relations between Denmark and Ireland. Denmark has an embassy in Dublin, and Ireland has an embassy in Copenhagen. Diplomatic relations were established in January 1962. Both countries have since 1973 been members of the European Union.
History.
20th century.
During the 19th century, many historians have commented on the differences between the Danish and Irish economies. Both countries were mostly agricultural and both countries were great import countries of the British market. Especially, bacon, eggs and butter. So there were competition between the two countries. Even Horace Plunkett said in 1908; "I have always felt that Ireland a second Denmark was no bad
ideal for our reformers to set before them."
In 1943, Irish historian J.P. Beddy wrote: Many Irish historians and economists have compared the two countries; Raymond Crotty in 1966, Cormac Ó Gráda in 1977 and Joseph Lee in 1989.
Current relations.
When both countries joined the European Union, Denmark opened an embassy in Dublin. Denmark lent 400 million euro to Ireland in 2010 as a rescue deal.
Cooperation and trade.
An air transport treaty was signed in 1947, between both countries. In 1993, both countries signed a double taxation treaty. In 2008, Danish export to Ireland amounted 5,8 billion DKK, while Irish exports amounted 5,9 billion DKK.
Expatriates.
About 1000 Danes live in Ireland.

Denmark–Israel relations refers to the bilateral relationship between Denmark and Israel. Relations between the two states are close.
History.
Denmark voted for the partition of Palestine in 1947 and supports Israel in the United Nations. In Jerusalem, there is a monument to the rescue of Danish Jews and a school is also named in Denmark's honor. King Christian X hospital in Eitanim is named after Denmark's king during World War II. Denmark has an embassy in Israel, and Israel has an embassy in Copenhagen. Denmark recognized and established diplomatic relations with Israel on 2 February 1949.
From 9 April 1940, to August 1943, the Danish Jewish community was safe from persecution. In May 2005, Denmark apologized for sending Jews to concentration camps. Former Prime Minister, On the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, told a crowd of people that the actions are a stain on Denmark’s otherwise good reputation. The Danes rescue of all Danish Jews during World War II, the Yad Vashem declared Denmark Righteous Among the Nations.

Nezihe Viranyalı

Nezihe Viranyalı (1925 – December 22, 2004) was one of the first Turkish female aviators. She was trained by Sabiha Gökçen, Turkey's first female pilot, world's first female combat pilot.
Biography.
Born in Vidin, Bulgaria of Turkish descent, she immigrated to Turkey as she was impressed by Sabiha Gökçen's flight tour around the Balkan countries and the air show at Sofia in 1938. At the age of sixteen, she enrolled at the flight school "Türkkușu" (literally "Turkishbird") of the Turkish Aeronautical Association, where Sabiha Gökçen was a trainer. Nezihe Viranyalı learned skydiving first, and later obtained her pilot license for gliders and airplanes. She was the last of the four female aviators trained by Sabiha Gökçen, the others being Edibe Subaşı, Yıldız Uçman, and Sahavet Karapas. She herself trained hundreds of aviators at the Türkkușu Flight School.
In 1955, she took part as a skydiver at the international air shows held in the Netherlands and Germany. Invited by the American pilot Jacqueline Cochran, she went to the United States to attend a course on civil aviation at the University of Tennessee on a scholarship. In 1956, Nezihe Viranyalı displayed her flying skills at an air show in Baghdad, Iraq.
In her career, she parachuted more than 100 times, had more than 180 hours of flight time on gliders and more than 2,800 hours on airplanes. Nezihe Viranyalı retired from her position as an instructor from the Türkkușu Flight School.
She is quoted as saying"If you’ve made a good landing, it’s impossible to recapture that joy again on another day. The emotions you experience as you bring your aircraft to the parking place and turn off the engine are nothing less than what great conquerors feel when they storm the gates of a fortress. And you have the right to feel that way. You too are a conqueror, who has just conquered the skies..."
Stuart Kline's exhaustive work "Türk Havacılık Kronolojisi / A Chronicle of Turkish Aviation" mentions her with pictures.
Private life.
In the 1940s, she was one of the few women in Ankara to own an automobile. She enjoyed ice skating and playing the accordion. Besides Bulgarian and Russian, she was also fluent in English and German.
Never married, she spent her last years in a retirement home at Maltepe, Istanbul. One of her legs was amputated because of gangrene following surgery on a fractured foot and shoulder bone.
Nezihe Viranyalı died of colon cancer at a hospital in Göztepe, Istanbul. She was buried at the Karacaahmet Cemetery.
Honors.
In 2004, she was honored with the award "The Successful Turkish Woman" by the newspaper "Dünya Gazetesi".

Enric Vallès Prat (born 1 March 1990) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Segunda División B (third-tier) club Olot. He plays as a midfielder. He began his career in the youth system of Barcelona before playing for NAC Breda and Birmingham City.
Career.
Vallès was born in Barcelona. He began his football career in the youth system of his home-town club, FC Barcelona. In 2008 he played alongside Gai Assulin and Iago Falqué in the team that reached the final of the Spanish Youth Cup, in which they lost 2–0 to Sevilla's youngsters. Vallès left Barcelona in August 2008, as an 18-year-old, to turn professional with NAC Breda of the Dutch Eredivisie, signing a two-year contract.
Recommended by an agent who likened him to Albert Riera, then of Liverpool, Vallès had a week's trial with English Premier League club Birmingham City. The trial proved successful, and in May 2010, he signed a pre-contract agreement to join the club on 1 July upon the expiry of his contract with NAC Breda, where he had played four matches in the Eredivisie. In his first interview upon joining the Blues, Vallès described himself as a "left midfielder who can also play on the wing" whose main attributes were his dribbling and his work ethic; he also revealed his desire to play in the same team as fellow Spaniard Míchel. Manager Alex McLeish summed him up as a "big, tall, lad, left-sided and maybe not the explosion of some wingers, but a very good footballer".
After a successful pre-season, Vallès made his competitive debut for Birmingham in the second-round League Cup-tie against Rochdale on 26 August 2010. His only other appearance came in the next round of the League Cup, and a proposed loan move to League One (third-tier) club Brighton & Hove Albion or possible return to Spain came to nothing when the player suffered a stress fracture to his foot. He made a return to the first-team squad as an unused substitute for the final match of the season, which confirmed Birmingham's relegation from the Premier League, and the club took up their option to extend his contract for a further year. Vallès was occasionally included in the matchday squad during that year but made no more first-team appearances, and he was released when his contract expired at the end of the 2011–12 season.
On 15 November 2012, Vallès signed for Olot of the Spanish Tercera División (fourth tier). He scored four goals as Olot finished as champions of their group, thus qualifying for the promotion playoffs.</ref> Although Vallès suffered a hamstring injury in the second round of the playoffs that was to keep him out for what remained of the season, his team went on to defeat Arandina in the final round to earn promotion to the Segunda División B for the first time in the club's history.</ref>

<doc id="20794397" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20794397" title="Hurricane Omar (2008)">
Hurricane Omar (2008)

Hurricane Omar was a strong hurricane that took an unusual southwest to northeast track through the eastern Caribbean Sea during October, 2008. Forming out of a tropical disturbance on October 13, Omar initially moved slowly in the eastern Caribbean Sea. By October 15, Omar began to quickly intensify as deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Later that day, an eye developed and the storm began to accelerate to the northeast. Early on October 16, Omar reached its peak intensity with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 958 mbar (hPa; 28.29 inHg). Shortly after, the hurricane rapidly weakened to Category 1 intensity. After slightly re-strengthening the next day, Omar weakened to a tropical storm before degenerating into a non-convective low pressure area. The remnants of Omar persisted until October 21 at which time it dissipated to the west of the Azores.
Throughout the eastern Caribbean, Omar affected numerous islands, most of which only recorded minor impacts. Large swells and heavy rains impacted the ABC islands. Antigua and Barbuda sustained $54 million in damages, mainly on Antigua as nine homes were destroyed, several others damaged and many farms were inundated by flood waters. One person died in Puerto Rico after suffering a stress-induced cardiac arrest. The United States Virgin Islands also sustained significant damage, costing roughly $6 million. Numerous boats and homes were damaged and over 100 power poles were snapped. Total losses from the storm were estimated at $79 million.
Meteorological history.
On September 30, a well-developed tropical wave moved off the eastern coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic Ocean. Deep convection formed around a prominent mid-level circulation as it moved towards the west. However, the convection diminished on October 2 before entering the Caribbean Sea a week later. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea, shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the low. Continued development followed and the low was designated as Tropical Depression Fifteen at 0600 UTC on October 13 while located about 190 miles (305 kilometres) south of the southeastern tip of the Dominican Republic. The previous steady westward motion that the system took across the Atlantic halted as it entered an area of weak steering currents and significant motion was not expected for another day or two. As the structure of the storm improved, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) gave it the name "Omar".
Located to the southeast of a broad and deep tropospheric trough and to the west of a low to mid-level ridge, Omar took a counter-clockwise turn on October 14. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Omar began to undergo an extended period of rapid intensification as very deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Wind shear around the storm, which was previously inhibiting quick development, weakened, allowing for further strengthening. Later that day, a 11.5 to 17.2 mi (18.5 to 27.7 km) wide eye formed as the storm began to turn towards the northeast due to the trough. With the formation of an eye, the Dvorak technique rendered an intensity of 75 mph (120 km/h), signifying that Omar had intensified into a hurricane. The intensification briefly stalled as the eyewall eroded and the center of the storm became slightly elliptical. However, deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast as the storm neared Puerto Rico. Shortly after, the eye quickly became well-defined and appeared on visible satellite images, an indication the storm was intensifying. The chances of rapid intensification were good as the storm featured well-developed outflow and prominent banding features.
With very warm sea surface temperatures, high ocean heat content, low wind shear, and a moist air mass, Omar quickly reached its peak intensity early on October 16 as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). During the intensification phase, the forward motion of the hurricane increased to 20 mph (32 km/h). Once in the Atlantic Ocean, Omar began to rapidly weaken, with winds decreasing by 50 mph (85 km/h) in 12 hours. Visible satellite images depicted an exposed low-level circulation with convection displaced to the east due to a combination of very high wind shear and dry air. By October 17, most of the deep convection associated with the system dissipated; however, a brief decrease in wind shear allowed Omar to re-strengthen to its secondary peak, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). During this phase, convection redeveloped around the center and an eye reformed. Later that day, the trough that caused the rapid northeastern motion bypassed Omar, leading to decreasing movement.
A weakening storm, Omar continued towards the northeast due to a mid to upper-level ridge located south of the system and the mid-latitude westerlies to the north. Late on October 17, wind shear increased once more as Omar tracked over waters below . Around 0000 UTC on October 18, Omar weakened to a tropical storm as deep convection associated with it dissipated. Twelve hours later, while still producing tropical storm-force winds, the storm degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. The remnants of Omar persisted until 0600 UTC on October 21 when it dissipated about 805 mi (1,295 km) west of the Azores.
Preparations.
On October 15, the governor of the United States Virgin Islands announced the final preparations for Hurricane Omar as he signed a State of Emergency declaration for the territory. Public schools would be closed on October 16. All non-essential workers would be dismissed at 10 a.m. local time. At 6 p.m. curfew was put in place for the same day. Only those with valid passes would be allowed to be out after the curfew was put in place. That same day, a Hurricane Warning and flash flood watch were put in place in anticipation of hurricane-force winds and torrential rains from Omar. The American Red Cross planned to open shelters throughout the islands before the hurricane struck. Sandbags were also being distributed in St. Croix. A large oil refinery, which produces , was shut down and only necessary workers remained at the refinery.
On Sint Maarten, officials advised residents to start all necessary actions to prepare for a hurricane. Residents were told to clear their yards of any debris or lose furniture that could become airborne during the storm, place shutters over windows and doors and assist elderly neighbors with shuttering their homes, and mariners should find a safe haven. A curfew from 10:00 p.m. on October 15 to 10:00 a.m. on October 16 was put in place. Due to the possibility of flash flooding, residents were to unclog and free up all waterways around their homes. Officials also warned people to stay away from areas prone to landslides until the "all-clear" was given. Owners of livestock were advised to have insured that they were secured in holding areas. As a precaution, the water supply would be shut down from 8:00 p.m. October 15 to 8:00 a.m. October 16. Four public areas, St. Peters Community Center, Dutch Quarter Community Center, Genevieve de Weever School, and the Salvation Army building would be used as emergency shelters.
All public activities, flights, and schools were either closed or canceled on Puerto Rico. Eighteen shelters were open on the eastern part of the island. Also, on Anguilla, residents in the Sandy Ground, Valley Bottom, Welches and Mount Fortune areas were placed under evacuation orders. Shelters were opened throughout the island for those in need of shelter. Schools and government offices were also closed and visitors were told to leave the island.
Impact.
Omar produced moderate damage throughout numerous islands, amounting to at least $60 million (2008 USD) and one death was related to the storm.
While it was moving little over the south-central Caribbean, Omar brought prolonged tropical storm conditions to the ABC Islands. Sustained winds to near gale force battered the islands, although peak gusts to 58 mph (92 km/h) were confined to Bonaire. In 24 hours, a maximum precipitation total of 4.0 in (102 mm) was recorded on Aruba, while 1.7 in (43 mm) and 1.5 in (41 mm) of rain fell in Curaçao and Bonaire, respectively. The high winds damaged roofs on all three islands, and rough seas caused beach erosion and significant damage to coastal facilities. Some rain damage also occurred, with significant flooding reported in some parts of Aruba. In the SSS Islands (Saba, St. Eustatius, and Sint Maarten) strong winds from Omar, gusting up to 76 mph (122 km/h), and high waves caused significant damage and coastal flooding. On Sint Maarten, rainfall from the storm totaled to 5.4 in (139.4 mm). Damage in Sint Maarten was mainly limited to beach erosion and scattered power outages.
The island of Dominica suffered severe damage from Hurricane Omar. The village of Scotts Head, with a population of 450, was cut off from the rest of the country as roads were extensively damaged. The village also suffered water losses, electricity shortage, and landline telephones were cut off. Ports throughout the country were severely damaged. All barge access for hauling sand and stones were destroyed. The airport also sustained some damage. Seven boats ran aground during the storm. Minor damage was reported in Anguilla. Two hotels sustained roof damage, downed treed knocked down power lines causing scattered power outages, and the rough seas caused severe beach erosion. Three cargo ships and seven boats ran aground and two other boats sank.
In Antigua and Barbuda, winds from Omar were recorded at 40 mph, with gusts to 48 mph. Intense squall lines brought torrential rains, falling at rates of 2 in (50.8 mm) at times, peaking at 2.22 in (56.4 mm) per hour from 0900 UTC to 1200 UTC on October 16. The maximum recorded rainfall was 9.1 in (232.6 mm) however, up to 11 in (279.4 mm) was estimated to have fallen in the mountains. Storm Surge was estimated at 2–4 ft (0.6–1.2 m) with waves reaching 5–8 ft (1.5–2.4 m) in height. Nine homes were destroyed and several landslides were reported. No fatalities were associated with Omar, and only a few sustained minor injuries. The most severe damage was dealt to roads and agriculture due to flooding. Seventy-five people were forced to evacuate to shelters as their homes were flooded. Several farms were washed away, including their livestock. Numerous farmers lost their harvest due to flooding. Damages in Barbuda were estimated at $18 million. Agricultural losses in Antigua amounted to around $11 million (2008 USD) and property damage amounted to $25 million.
In Puerto Rico, a man died after he collapsed from cardiac arrest while trying to install storm shutters on his home. As a tropical wave, the precedent to Omar produced heavy rains over the island, causing minor flooding. After passing by Puerto Rico a second time, Omar produced locally heavy rains, which caused minor street flooding.
On St. Croix, waves up to 15 ft (4.5 m) from Omar sank about 47 boats, leading to a large oil spill around the islands. About 400 ships broke lose from the docks, 200 of which lost their anchors. Omar produced upwards of 7 in (177.8 mm) of rain on the island within a 24 hour span. Although St. Croix was brushed by the eyewall, sustained winds reached 53 mph (85 km/h) with gusts to 72 mph (116 km/h). Three people needed to be rescued when their ship struck a reef and began to sink. Most of the islands 55,000 residents were without power as over 100 utility poles were destroyed. Damages on the island were estimated at $700,000 with another $1 million in clean-up costs. St. Thomas, one of the hardest hit islands, was left completely without power in the wake of the hurricane. All of the major intersections were shut down as traffic lights were either on the ground or without power. Damages on the island totaled to $5.3 million.
In the Gros Islet Quarter on St. Lucia, rough seas damaged a jetty and grounded a yacht. In Soufrière, four homes were destroyed by the storm surge, which also made some areas impassible. The storm surge also flooded parts of the Anse la Raye Quarter, leading to officials declaring a mandatory evacuation of the area. On Montserrat, very little damage was reported. A few minor landslides occurred in rural areas; no impact was caused by them. On Nevis there was relatively little damage although the beachfront part of the Four Seasons Resort was severely damaged and was subsequently closed for an extended period. Throughout St. Kitts and Nevis, damage was estimated at $19 million.
Aftermath.
The damage dealt to the agricultural sector of Antigua and Barbuda fueled major concerns for "food security" in 2009. The government allocated about $33,897,420 to help develop and repair the industry. Significant expansions of croplands were discussed, 15,000 ft2 (4572 m2) area, to help promote growth of the sector.
On October 29, in the wake of Omar, President George W. Bush signed a major disaster declaration for the United States Virgin Islands, allowing public aid to assist the islands. The Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA, had received 60 requests for public assistance throughout the area. Monetary value for the assistance was estimated at $3 million and growing. Twenty-five departments and agencies were approved of for federal support, namely the U.S. V.I. Department of Public Works. Several non-profit organizations also received support from FEMA, while those that did not meet the criteria were referred to the Small Business Administration’s low-interest loan program.
On Dominica, Omar's close pass to the island left 30 families homeless and severely hampered the fishing community. On December 15, the Board of Directors of the Caribbean Development Bank approved $9.16 million for assistance to those affected by Omar on the island and to restore the infrastructure damaged by the hurricane. On December 18, the government of Dominica invested $4 million in aid for the fishing communities impacted by Omar. A total of 140 fishermen were provided with $250 per week for a total of four weeks. Sixty-two of which continued to receive funds due to their circumstances. The government also purchased 121 boat engines to distribute to fishers. Another $794,000 was spent to repair 47 boats and construct another 28 that had been damaged or destroyed by Omar. The government also bought replacement fishing gear.

Lu Zhi (Tang Dynasty)

Lu Zhi (陸贄; 754–805), courtesy name Jingyu (敬輿), was an official of the Chinese Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Dezong. Even before he became chancellor, he became a trusted advisor to Emperor Dezong, who greatly valued his opinion. However, eventually he offended Emperor Dezong by repeatedly accusing Emperor Dezong's associate Pei Yanling of misconduct, and he was demoted and died in exile. He left a relatively large body of writing on his advice to Emperor Dezong, which discussed in fair detail the condition of the Tang people at the time and thus is considered valuable, by historians such as the modern historian Bo Yang, in understanding mid-Tang life.
Background.
Lu Zhi was born in 754, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Su Prefecture (蘇州, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu) and claimed ancestry from the royal house of the Warring States period state Qi, through officials of Han Dynasty, Eastern Wu, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Southern Qi, Liang Dynasty, and Chen Dynasty — although the family did not record the family line completely. while his biography in the "New Book of Tang" gave no name for his father, while indicating, in its table of chancellors' family trees, that his grandfather was named Lu Qiwang (陸齊望) and served as the director of the archival bureau, while his father's name was Lu Ba (陸灞) and served as a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs.
It was said that Lu Zhi lost his father early, and that he did not associate much with others. He was studious in his studies of Confucianism. When he was 17 (presumably 771, when Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong was emperor), Lu passed the imperial examinations based on his knowledge and use of language, and was made the sheriff of Zheng County (鄭縣, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). After his term of service was over, he was returning home to visit his mother, when he went through Shou Prefecture (壽州, in modern Lu'an, Anhui). The prefect of Shou Prefecture at the time was Zhang Yi (who would eventually be chancellor), and while Lu did not know Zhang, he went to visit Zhang to pay respect, because Zhang was well-known at the time. Zhang kept Lu at his mansion for three days and got to know him. He was impressed by Lu and asked for them to be considered friends, despite the difference in their age. When Lu was set to continue his journey, Zhang wanted to give him a large amount of money as a gift to his mother, but Lu declined, accepting only a gift of tea. Later, Lu was recalled to serve as a secretary at Weinan County (渭南, in modern Weinan), and later was made an imperial censor with the title "Jiancha Yushi" (監察御史).
Service under Emperor Dezong prior to chancellorship.
Before Zhu Ci's rebellion.
Meanwhile, Lu Zhi's abilities had drawn the attention of Emperor Daizong's crown prince Li Kuo. After Emperor Daizong died in 779 and Li Kuo ascended to the throne (as Emperor Dezong), he made Lu an imperial scholar (翰林學士, "Hanlin Xueshi") and later "Cibu Yuanwailang" (祠部員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (禮部, "Lǐbu"); he also often sought advice from Lu. It was said that Lu had a faithful character, and, thankful that Emperor Dezong valued him for his advice, wanted to repay Emperor Dezong by providing detailed and honest advice; in turn, Emperor Dezong came to trust his advice greatly.
As of fall 783, with Emperor Dezong intending to reimpose imperial authority over a number of circuits which their military governors ("Jiedushi") had long ruled in a "de facto" independent manner, imperial forces were locked into campaigns against several circuits in the Yellow River region — Pinglu (平盧, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong, then ruled by Li Na; Lulong (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), then ruled by Zhu Tao; Weibo (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), then ruled by Tian Yue; and Hengji (恆冀, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei, then ruled by Wang Wujun — as well as Huaixi (淮西, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), then ruled by Li Xilie. Lu submitted a petition to Emperor Dezong, pointing out that imperial forces were stretched thin, and the imperial treasury was being drained dangerously, causing Emperor Dezong's officials to increase tax levies and causing resentment from the people. He suggested that the most important project should be political reform, not military action, and that he should terminate the campaigns. Emperor Dezong did not accept his suggestions.
During Zhu Ci's rebellion.
On November 2, 783, soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), at the capital Chang'an to await deployment to the wars in the east, were angry that they did not receive rewards they felt they deserved, and they mutinied, forcing Emperor Dezong to flee to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). Lu initially was unable to catch up with Emperor Dezong, but eventually did. Lu Zhi blamed the disaster on a number of high level officials, particularly the chancellor Lu Qi, whom Emperor Dezong greatly trusted, and when Emperor Dezong, wanting to deflect the criticism against Lu Qi, blamed the disaster on ill fortune instead, Lu Zhi submitted a lengthy statement as to how blaming ill fortune was dangerous for an emperor. Lu Zhi also advocated greater communication between Emperor Dezong and the officials, as a way to avoid having certain officials hiding the truth from the emperor.
Meanwhile, the Jingyuan soldiers supported Zhu Tao's brother Zhu Ci, himself an important general until Emperor Dezong removed him from his command due to Zhu Tao's rebellion, as their leader, and Zhu Ci soon declared himself the emperor of a new state of Qin. He put Fengtian under siege, but due to the efforts of the Tang general Li Huaiguang, Fengtian was saved, and Zhu Ci was forced to withdraw back to Chang'an. After the siege was lifted, two of the first promotions announced by Emperor Dezong went to Lu Zhi and his fellow imperial scholar Wu Tongwei (吳通微) (in Lu's case, to be "Kaozhong Langzhong" (考功郎中), a supervisorial official at the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, "Lìbu", note different tone than the ministry of rites). Lu declined on the basis that the officials who were most directly reporting to the emperor (as the imperial scholars were) should not be the ones receiving promotions first; rather, the promotions should go to the soldiers and military officers first. Emperor Dezong did not accept his refusal.
While at Fengtian, Emperor Dezong sent messengers to try to get Wang Wujun, Tian Yue, and Li Na to resubmit to him. He was also planning on issuing a general pardon to help assure them, as well as their followers, that there would be no reprisals. He entrusted the drafting of the edict to Lu for wording that would touch the hearts of others. In spring 784, with Lu drafting the edict, Emperor Dezong issued a general pardon in which the emperor himself took the blame for the wars, offering to pardon all involved in resisting him except Zhu Ci. It was said that the wording was effective in causing the generals to turn their hearts, and soon thereafter, Wang, Tian, and Li Na, all of whom had declared themselves princes, shed their princely titles and resubmitted to Tang rule.
While this was happening, however, Li Huaiguang, angry that Emperor Dezong had apparently distrusted him due to his severe criticism against Lu Qi (whom Emperor Dezong was forced to exile due to Li Huaiguang's demands), was plotting for rebellion himself, and he began to absorb the forces of other imperial generals in order to strengthen himself in preparation. Lu Zhi, seeing this, advocated peeling the armies that had been under other imperial generals away from Li Huaiguang generally, and it was said that it was due to Lu Zhi's advocacy that Li Sheng's army avoided being absorbed by Li Huaiguang. However, Emperor Dezong did not follow Lu's suggestion on also peeling the armies of Li Jianhui (李建徽) and Yang Huiyuan (楊惠元) away from Li Huaiguang's, and when Li Huaiguang rebelled soon thereafter, he seized Li Jianhui's and Yang's as well. As a result of Li Huaiguang's rebellion, Emperor Dezong was further forced to flee to Liang Prefecture (梁州, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). During the flight to Liang Prefecture, Emperor Dezong became separated from Lu, and it was said that he panicked so much that he cried in fear, offering a great reward for someone who can locate Lu, and when Lu later met up with him, he was very pleased. However, it was also said that because Lu was so blunt in his suggestions, the suspicious Emperor Dezong was also offended by him; therefore, such officials as Liu Congyi and Lu's imperial scholar colleague Jiang Gongfu were named chancellors at the time, while Lu, whose opinions Emperor Dezong valued, was not named chancellor. While at Liang Prefecture, it was at Lu's suggestion that Emperor Dezong did not act against the general Li Chulin (李楚琳), who had previously been a rebel (under the reasoning that if Emperor Dezong did so, Li Chulin might rebel again and endanger imperial forces), but when Jiang was demoted for speaking against Emperor Dezong's building a pagoda for his deceased daughter Princess Tang'an, Lu's attempt to intercede for Jiang was ineffective in preventing Jiang from being demoted. Lu also greatly advocated against a proposed alliance with Tufan on account that Tufan had treacherously attacked Tang on many occasions in the past, and when Tufan forces withdrew from the field after first promising to attack Zhu Ci (who had renamed his state Han) together, Lu, instead of showing distress, wrote a congratulatory submission to Emperor Dezong.
After Zhu Ci's rebellion.
After Li Sheng recaptured Chang'an in summer 784 and Zhu Ci was killed in flight, Emperor Dezong returned to Chang'an, and Lu Zhi followed him. (On the way back to Chang'an, Emperor Dezong again considered replacing Li Chulin, but again per Lu's opinion did not do so.) Upon arrival in Chang'an, Emperor Dezong promoted Lu to be "Zhongshu Sheren" (中書舍人), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省), but continued to have him serve as an imperial scholar. In 785, after Li Huaiguang, who had occupied Hezhong Circuit (河中, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), suffered repeated defeats at the hands of the Tang generals Ma Sui and Hun Zhen, committed suicide, Lu suggested to Emperor Dezong that the next thing to do is to reassure the former rebel generals (who had all resubmitted to Tang by this point except for Li Xilie, who had claimed the title of emperor of Chu) that he did not intend reprisals, and Emperor Dezong issued an edict to that effect.
Meanwhile, Emperor Dezong sent messengers to welcome Lu's mother Lady Wei to Chang'an, and treated her with great honors. Later, after Lady Wei died, Lu left governmental service and observed a period of mourning for her at the eastern capital Luoyang, staying at Fengle Temple (豐樂寺) at Mount Song. He refused all gifts sent to him in Lady Wei's honor, except for those from Wei Gao, the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu), because Wei Gao was an old friend. Because it was customary for husband and wife to be buried together, Emperor Dezong also had Lu's father disinterred and his casket escorted to Luoyang, to be buried with Lady Wei. After Lu's mourning period was over, he was recalled to the government to again serve as imperial scholar and also acting deputy minister of defense (兵部侍郎, "Bingbu Shilang"). He met with Emperor Dezong to thank the emperor, and was said to be so touched that he was prostrate on the ground, crying; Emperor Dezong was also touched by his display of emotions. It was said that the people at the time had great expectations that he would be chancellor, but the main chancellor at that time, Dou Can, was apprehensive of Lu. In 791, due to Dou's instigation, then, while Lu was officially made deputy minister of defense, he was stripped of his imperial scholar status.
Meanwhile, Dou gained a reputation for treachery, and he began to lose Emperor Dezong's favor. In 792, Dou Can's nephew Dou Shen (竇申), fearful that Lu would be further promoted by Emperor Dezong, forged some documents defamatory to Lu with his maternal uncle Li Zezhi (李則之) the Prince of Guo and his ally, the imperial scholar Wu Tongxuan (吳通玄). Emperor Dezong found out about this and exiled Dou Shen, Li Zezhi, and Wu, and soon ordered Wu to commit suicide. Soon thereafter, Dou Can himself was exiled to be the secretary general at Chen Prefecture (郴州, in modern Chenzhou, Hunan), and Lu and Zhao Jing were named chancellors, with the designation "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事); both of them also given the office of "Zhongshu Shilang" (中書侍郎) as the deputy heads of the legislative bureau.
As chancellor.
Soon after becoming chancellor, Lu Zhi advocated a system where the various supervising officials be allowed and required to recommend some capable subordinates for promotion. Emperor Dezong initially agreed, but after some time, believing reports that the officials were not recommending the right individuals, he wanted to end the system and return to the old system where the chancellors would select the officials for promotion. Lu opposed this reversion, pointing out that chancellors were formerly supervisorial officials and that it was not logical to believe that being given chancellor posts suddenly qualified them to select officials. Emperor Dezong, however, reverted to the old method anyway. Soon thereafter, when the military governor of Lingnan Circuit (嶺南, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong) was complaining about the foreign merchants moving their businesses to Annan Circuit (安南, headquartered in modern Hanoi, Vietnam) and taking the substantial tax revenue away from LIngnan, Emperor Dezong considered agreeing with Lingnan's complaint and investigating the matter. Lu opposed this investigation, pointing out that both Lingnan and Annan were parts of the empire and that it must be that the Lingnan officials offended the foreign merchants by improperly exercising legal authority. It is not known whether Emperor Dezong agreed with Lu.
Also in 792, after the director of finances, Ban Hong (班宏) died, Lu recommended Li Sun (李巽) to succeed Ban. Emperor Dezong initially agreed, but soon wanted to make Pei Yanling Ban's successor instead. Lu vehemently objected, arguing that Pei was frivolous and treacherous, but his arguments were to no avail, as Emperor Dezong soon made Pei the director of finances. Later in the year, when reports of a great flood that affected the regions between the Yellow River and the Yangtze River — some 40 prefectures — Emperor Dezong, initially believing that the reports were probably exaggerated, did not want to send special emissaries to comfort the people and to distribute aid, but at Lu's suggestion did so. He, however, wanted to omit Huaixi Circuit (which was then governed by Li Xilie's old subordinate Wu Shaocheng) from the emissaries' itineraries because Huaixi was not submitting tax revenues to the imperial treasury; Lu pointed out that even if Huaixi were inimical to the emperor that it should nevertheless receive aid, and Emperor Dezong agreed.
Also in 792, Lu submitted a lengthy submission pointing out that the then-existing method for supplying food to the soldiers on the northern and western borders — shipping food from the Yangtze and Huai River region to supply then — was no longer making sense since, due to the flooding, the food prices in the Yangtze and Huai regions were much higher than the food prices in the northwest. He suggested that, instead, the government purchase local food in the northwest and use it to supply the army. Emperor Dezong agreed. Lu also pointed out that at the time, the military command system, where every single army reported directly to the emperor, was highly inefficient, and a command structure that gave more authority to the generals needed to be imposed. It is not known how Emperor Dezong reacted to his proposal.
Meanwhile, Jiang Gongfu, who had long served as a member of the crown prince Li Song's staff, with few actual authorities, met Lu to ask for his help. Lu secretly responded:
In fear, Jiang offered to resign and asked to become a Taoist monk. When Emperor Dezong inquired as to the reason and found out that he was fearful, he did not dare to state that Lu had told him this information, and instead claimed that Dou told him the information. Angry that his words had been leaked, Emperor Dezong demoted Jiang to be the secretary general of Quan Prefecture (泉州, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian), and sent imperial eunuch messengers to Dou, in exile, to rebuke him.
In 793, Emperor Dezong sent eunuch messengers to Lu, secretly instructing him on several matters: that as for important matters, he should directly submit proposals to Emperor Dezong without first consulting Zhao; that he had heard reports that Miao Can (苗粲), the son of the deceased chancellor Miao Jinqing, had spoken words defamatory to Emperor Dezong, but because the matter was unclear, he wanted to make sure that Lu sent Miao Can and his brothers, all of whom shared names with ancient monarchs, to posts with few authorities; and that he believed that Lu was being overly avoiding entanglement by refusing to accept any gifts. Lu wrote a lengthy response, pointing out, as to discussing the matters with Zhao, that chancellors properly should discuss important matters with each other; that, as to Miao Can's matter, that the law must be observed and where there was no evidence that Miao had carried out wrongdoing, it would be wrong to exile him based on innuendo; and, as to the matter of accepting gifts, that refusing all gifts was the best method to avoid appearance of favoritism.
Meanwhile, Li Sun, who had been demoted previously by Dou Can but who was now Dou's superior, submitted accusations that Dou had accepted gifts from Liu Shining (劉士寧), the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). Emperor Dezong, in anger, wanted to execute Dou, but Lu, pointing out that Dou's guilt was uncertain, argued that Dou should be spared. Emperor Dezong initially agreed, but soon still ordered Dou to commit suicide and confiscated his assets. (Despite Lu's submission, it was still commonly believed at the time that Lu had, due to his old rivalry with Dou, instigated Dou's death, causing Lu's reputation to suffer.)
Also in 793, Zhao was made "Menxia Shilang" (門下侍郎), the deputy head of the examination bureau (門下省) instead of "Zhongshu Shilang", but remained chancellor. Nevertheless, Zhao, believing this to be a plot by Lu to squeeze him out of power (since the office of the chancellor was within the legislative bureau), became resentful of Lu and often used illness as an excuse not to be involved in major decisions.
In winter 793, Liu Shining, whose commission was not out of Emperor Dezong's own choice, was expelled by his own officer Li Wanrong (李萬榮). Lu advocated sending an imperial official to replace Liu as military governor, but Emperor Dezong, fearing a possible rebellion, made Li Wanrong the acting military governor, against Lu's advice.
In 794, Lu proposed that some of the exiled officials be allowed to move closer to the capital. Emperor Dezong initially agreed, but became alarmed when he believed that Lu was moving them too close to the capital. Lu pointed out that Emperor Dezong's refusal to move them would mean that some highly talented officials would never get a chance to serve again, but it is not known how Emperor Dezong reacted to this. Lu also pointed out that Emperor Dezong was commissioning officials too much based on their ability to speak and as to whether he liked them or not, but Emperor Dezong refused to heed his advice. Lu further submitted a major six-point proposal to reform the taxation and land ownership system, believing that the then-existing system was becoming inequitable:
It is not clearly stated in history how Emperor Dezong reacted, but he appeared to reject Lu's proposal. Meanwhile, Lu was continuing to attack Pei for frivolousness, greed, and dishonesty, but Emperor Dezong, pleased with Pei that Pei was causing more money to be available to Emperor Dezong personally, was happy with Pei and thus displeased when Lu attacked him. Meanwhile, though, Lu, unaware that Zhao resented him, was often discussing these faults of Pei's with Zhao, and Zhao in turn alerted Pei as to how Lu was attacking him, allowing Pei to deflect the criticism when meeting Emperor Dezong. In winter 794, Lu was removed from his chancellor position and made an advisor to Li Song.
Exile.
As soon as Lu Zhi was removed from his chancellor position, Pei Yanling begin attacking him as well as his allies Li Chong (李充), Zhang Pang (張滂), and Li Xian (李銛), accusing them of fostering dissent among the imperial guard ranks. When, subsequently, an imperial guard soldier did complain to Emperor Dezong that he was not receiving adequate supplies from the directory of finances, Emperor Dezong believed Pei's accusations, and in summer 795 demoted Lu, Li Chong, Zhang, and Li Xian all to be prefectural secretaries general — in Lu's case, to be the secretary general of Zhong Prefecture (忠州, in modern Chongqing). This caused Lu to be directly serving under an official that he had previously demoted, Li Jifu — who was the prefect of Zhong Prefecture. Lu's relatives and friends were all alarmed, fearful that Li Jifu would carry out reprisals. However, when Lu arrived in Zhong Prefecture, Li Jifu honored him as if he were still a chancellor, and while Lu initially feared that reprisals would come later, they eventually became close friends.
Lu was at Zhong Prefecture for 10 years, and it was said that he often stayed at home; he did not handle official business much, nor did he write much, in fear that he would draw further disaster by doing so. Later, when Li Jifu was succeeded by one Xue Yan (薛延), Emperor Dezong sent a messenger to comfort Lu, showing still some respect for Lu. Wei Gao also repeatedly submitted petitions requesting that he be allowed to yield his position to Lu. After Emperor Dezong died in 805 and Li Song became emperor (as Emperor Shunzong), Emperor Shunzong issued an edict recalling Lu, along with three other officials that Emperor Dezong had exiled — Yang Cheng (陽城, who had been demoted for defending Lu), Zheng Yuqing, and Han Gao (韓皐). However, before the edict could arrive at Lu's and Yang's locations, they died. Lu was posthumously honored and given the posthumous name Xuan (宣, meaning "responsible").

Mytilopsis leucophaeata

Mytilopsis leucophaeata is a species of small bivalve mollusc in the false mussel family, Dreissenidae. It is commonly known as Conrad's false mussel or the Dark false mussel.
Identification.
It can look very similar to the zebra mussel, with similar stripes, but it can be distinguished from it by an apophysis or projection on the inside of the shell near the umbo. Shell length ranges between <1 and 2 cm, with an average length of 1 cm.
Distribution.
This species is native in the Gulf of Mexico, and spread from there via ballast water, or attached to oysters that were moved, to the Hudson River in the 1930s, and from there to other estuaries in the eastern US including Chesapeake Bay as well as to the Pernambuco coast in northeastern Brazil. This species also spread via ballast water to brackish waters in Europe, including the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea as well as the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.
Like the zebra mussel, this species is a significant biofouling pest in many countries, especially where it has been introduced in Europe.
Habitat.
"Mytilopsis leucophaeata" is found in brackish water, at salinities ranging from 0.5 psu to about 12 psu, although its upper salinity limit is usually about 5–6 psu. It attaches to hard substrates, including oyster and true mussel shells and cages for them, rocks, boats, and pilings, and also to ropes.

Predators and Prey

"Predators and Prey" is the fifth story arc that spreads from the twenty-first to the twenty-fifth issue of the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight" series of comic books, a continuation of the television series of the same name. The arc is written by Jane Espenson, Steven S. DeKnight, Drew Z. Greenberg, Jim Krueger, Doug Petrie.
Plot.
"Harmonic Divergence" (Issue #21).
In California, paparazzi witness Harmony Kendall drinking blood from a celebrity's neck outside a hot spot nightclub. Tabloids publish the photo of the biting, causing a world-wide stir of interest in vampires. Harmony uses this recent popular culture to land her own reality TV show with MTV. Soledad, a gang member, receives Slayer powers just in time to rescue herself from her old gang. She then turns down Andrew Wells and his offer to join the other Slayers, not wanting to join another gang.
Despite this, she tracks down Harmony and attempts to slay her during a taping of the reality show 'Harmony Bites'. Soledad loses and is killed, which just increases the popularity of the show and the negative public image the Slayers now have.
"Swell" (Issue #22).
Satsu and Kennedy investigate the results of a four armed demon's theft. It had been trying to steal the prototype of a 'Vampy Cat Play Friend' toy, which was produced by the Santorio Corporation. The two also argue for the real reason Buffy sent Kennedy to Satsu.
The doll turns out to be a living entity and turns Satsu into a caricature of a geisha, who mocks Kennedy's sexuality. Confused, the two manage to slay the creature.
Investigating the company building, they find the staff dead and sucked dry of all bodily fluids. A shipment of Vampy Cat dolls is headed for Scotland, the Slayer's main HQ. The shipment is boarded and destroyed, with the assistance of a sub now under Slayer control. The creatures praise "Twilight", a recurring villain, before their destruction.
Harmony Kendall uses the incident to decry the 'backlash' against vampires.
"Predators and Prey" (Issue #23).
At the Scotland Slayer base, Andrew informs Buffy, Xander, and Willow that he has found Nisha, the lieutenant of the rogue Slayers led by Simone Doffler, outside of Milan. Nisha has been snared in a Ragna Spider's demon nest, so Buffy immediately arranges that she and Andrew head off to confront Nisha. However, when she is confronted, Nisha reveals that Andrew is responsible for breeding the extinct Ragna Spider demon back into existence, though with exceptional genetic modifications. As Andrew frees Nisha, he tries to defend his actions; as he and Buffy argue, Simone arrives by teleportation. Buffy is unsuccessful with convincing Simone to return with her and Simone teleports herself, Nisha, and the Ragna Spider away to an undisclosed location.
As Buffy and Andrew track Simone via the radioactive isotopes Andrew equipped in the Ragna Spider, Buffy acknowledges that Andrew has come a long way and matured, but should have handled the situation differently, even if he feels responsible for Simone's rebellion. They locate Simone in an opera house on a coastal island, where Simone traps them and reveals she wants Andrew for the Ragna Spider; she wants revenge on him because he was her Watcher. However, Buffy engages and bests Simone in a fencing duel instead, which Simone responds to by pulling out a gun. Buffy surrenders, telling Simone that she can keep the Ranga Spider and that Buffy will leave her alone so long as Simone lets Buffy walk away with Andrew. However, before Simone can shoot, the Italy Squad arrives to rescue them. Buffy takes Simone's gun and shoots the Ragna Spider's cage, setting the demon loose on rogue Slayers while the Italy Squad evacuates. Back at their base of operations, Buffy tells Andrew that he should feel proud of what he has accomplished and how he was willing to lay down his life for the innocent and greater good. Andrew apologizes to Buffy for lying, and Buffy tells him to get used to screwing up for good reasons, he’s part of the family.
"Safe" (Issue #24).
Faith and Giles rescue an untrained Slayer named Courtney who had run away from her squad. Courtney informs them she was heading for a so-called Slayer Sanctuary in Hanselstadt, a safe zone for Slayers who do not wish to be chosen.
The trio travel to the town, noting disturbing incidents. Vampires congregate on the border, obviously not invading for fear of the sanctuary, and the town seems to have no children. Giles hooks up with a former Watcher named Duncan Fillworthe while the Slayers go to the Sanctuary. Giles discovers that Duncan has gone mad and fed the children of the town to the demon that inhabits the seeming Sanctuary. Since the vampires fear the demon, the townspeople are convinced that the demon is a guardian of the town and willingly sacrificed children to the demon in exchange for keeping away the vampires. After all the children in the town had been fed to the demon, Duncan turned to feeding it the runaway Slayers.
Giles saves Faith and Courtney from the threat, a monster that kills via the person's regrets. Duncan, who had followed, is killed when he regrets his complicity in the deaths. The vampires outside of town, now knowing the way is seemingly clear, mass for an attack. Giles and the Slayers swiftly organize an opposing army of adults.
"Living Doll" (Issue #25).
While the Summers sisters' relationship is still strained, Dawn goes missing as Buffy prepares the Slayer army against a vampire splinter army led by Judas Cradle. However, the ensuing battle ends quickly since Cradle's army consists of only six people and Buffy and Xander focus their attention on finding Dawn in the woods. To ascertain Dawn's possible whereabouts, Xander arranges for Andrew to find Dawn's thricewise ex-boyfriend Kenny at the University of California, Berkeley. Andrew poses as a college student interested in becoming Kenny's new roommate and sets up totems in Kenny's room that allow Willow to teleport the entire contents of Kenny's room to Scotland. However, when Kenny is confronted, he transforms into his demonic aspect and escapes into the nearby forest.
Meanwhile, Dawn has undergone a third transformation - she has become a doll - and has been captured by Geppetto-like elderly man. Despite Dawn's attempts to escape, she is held back by other dolls made by the man, whom the dolls consider their father. The dollmaker tries to console Dawn by revealing he asked the other dolls to keep her from escaping to prevent her from breaking herself open and spilling her soul. Buffy and Xander eventually find the dollmaker's cottage, but Xander is soon rendered unconscious by poisoned darts and Buffy is assaulted by woodland creatures. Dawn makes another failed attempt to escape and as she cries out for Buffy to save her, Kenny bursts into the dollmaker's cottage. Upon seeing Kenny, Dawn apologizes to him, which reverses the effects of the spell, allowing her to become a human again. After Buffy threatens the dollmaker for detaining Dawn, she decides to leave him alone when his dolls intervene on his behalf. Dawn and Kenny talk about what happened between them and they both apologize for their actions, making amends and parting ways. Dawn reconciles with Buffy, who apologizes for not being there enough for her and that though she may have a thousand Slayers to lead, she only has one sister she loves.
Production and writing.
Each individual issue was written by a different writer and each issue has a title instead of the overall story-arc title. The story-arc is a very loose one compared to the previous ones and each issue involves certain characters point of view of the over-all plot.
Canonical issues.
This series has been described as 'canon' by both Whedon and various commentators. As the creator of "Buffy", Joss Whedon's association with Buffyverse story is often linked to how canonical the various stories are. Since Whedon is writing this story, it will be seen as a continuation of the official continuity established by "Buffy" and "Angel".
"Season Eight" contradicts and supersedes information given in the paperback novels set after Season Seven, such as "Queen of the Slayers" and "Dark Congress", which are described as being set in an unofficial "parallel continuity".

Wiesbaden-Kloppenheim

Kloppenheim is a borough of Wiesbaden, capital of the federal state of Hesse, Germany. Kloppenheim was incorporated into Wiesbaden in 1928. The adjacent boroughs are (clockwise, starting in the north) Naurod, Auringen, Medenbach, Igstadt, Bierstadt, and Heßloch.
History.
Frankish graves in the area of present-day Bierhausweg indicate that a settlement existed in Kloppenheim as early as the 6th and 7th centuries. Kloppenheim is first mentioned by name in a deed of gift in 927 AD during the reign of Saxon King Henry I. In a further certificate, Count Drutwin bequeaths six marks to the Bleidenstadt monastery in "Clopheim" and a forest with adjacent fields. The name "Clopheim" meant "residence on the rock of the hill", and probably dates to Frankish time. 
In the history of the following centuries, Kloppenheim played no special role. It was part of the "Königssondergau" of Charlemagne and later was among the dominions of the House of Nassau. Like the surrounding areas, Kloppenheim experienced the hardships of armed conflict over the centuries, particularly during the Thirty Years War and the French Revolutionary Wars in .
The religious life of Kloppenheim was long closely associated with the monastery in Bleidenstadt (now Taunusstein), founded by Charlemagne. The present church dates largely from the years 1706 to 1708.
In 1927, Kloppenheim, with 970 inhabitants, celebrated its 1000-year anniversary, which attracted thousands of visitors. One year later it was incorporated into Wiesbaden.
During World War II, on March 22, 1945, six days before the invasion of Wiesbaden by American forces, three Russian prisoners of war - Kostiantin Sachum (17), Ivan Nikitin (18) and Nikolin Savtzuk (21) - were shot to death in Kloppenheim. In 2002, it was discovered that this was done in order to cover up that one of the prisoners had been mistreated. Today a commemorative plaque stands in the Kloppenheim cemetery for the three Russian soldiers.
Politics.
The distribution of seats in the borough assembly ("Ortsbeirat") of Kloppenheim is as follows:
Demographics.
As of November 30, 2008, Kloppenheim has 2,309 inhabitants, of whom 1,187 (51.4%) are women and 1,122 (48.6%) are men. The percentage of foreigners is 5.5% (127).

Ichthyosis hystrix

Ichthyosis hystrix is a group of rare skin disorders in the ichthyosis family of skin disorders characterized by massive hyperkeratosis with an appearance like spiny scales. This term is also used to refer to a type of epidermal nevi with extensive bilateral distribution.
Ichthyosis hystrix, Curth-Macklin type.
The symptoms of Ichthyosis hystrix Curth-Macklin are similar to epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (NPS-2 type) but there is no blistering and the hyperkeratosis is verrucous or spine-like. The hyperkeratosis is brown-grey in colour and is most obvious on the arms and legs. It is an autosomal dominant condition and can be caused by errors to the KRT1 gene. It is named after Helen Ollendorff Curth (1899-1982), a German-Jewish dermatologist, and Madge Thurlow Macklin (1893–1962), an American medical geneticist, and is one of the first syndromes named after two women.
Ichthyosis hystrix, Lambert type.
Also known as Ichthyosis hystrix gravior or porcupine man. This disease is characterised by spiny scales which cover the entire body except the face, genitals, palms and soles. The only known cases were in Edward Lambert (known as the porcupine man) who was exhibited in front of the Royal Society in London in 1731 and three generations of his descendants. No cases of this disease are now known though some experts believe that it may have been a type of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. From the history of the Lambert family the disease appears to have been an autosomal dominant condition.
Hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness syndrome.
HID syndrome is also known as Ichthyosis hystrix, Rheydt type after the German city of Rheydt near Düsseldorf where it was first discovered. Symptoms are bilateral hearing loss and spiky hyperkeratotic masses which cover the whole body though the palms and soles are less badly affected. It can be differentiated from KID syndrome which also has symptoms of deafness and ichthyosis by the different distribution of hyperkeratosis. It is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation to the GJB2 gene (the same gene affected by KID syndrome).
Ichthyosis hystrix, Baefvertstedt type.
An extremely rare disease of which only a few isolated cases are known.

The Boot File System (Named BFS on Linux, but BFS also refers to the Be File System) was used on UnixWare to store files necessary to its boot process.
It does not support directories, and only allows contiguous allocation for files, to make it simpler to be used by the boot loader.
Implementations.
Besides the UnixWare support, Martin Hinner wrote a bfs kernel module for Linux that supports it.
He documented the file system layout as part of the process.
The original BFS was written at AT&T Bell Laboratories for the UNIX System V, Version 4.0 porting base in 1986. It was written by Ron Schnell, who is also the author of Dunnet (game)

Erythrokeratodermia variabilis (also known as "Erythrokeratodermia figurata variabilis," "Keratosis extremitatum progrediens," "Keratosis palmoplantaris transgrediens et progrediens," "Mendes da Costa syndrome," "Mendes da Costa type erythrokeratodermia," and "Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma") is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that usually presents at birth or during the first year of life. To date, it is thought to be caused by mutations in genes encoding for connexin channels proteins in the epidermis, leading to the misregulation of homeostasis in keratinocytes. 
One type is characterized by generalized, persistent, brown hyperkeratosis with accentuated skin markings, while a second type is localized, with involvement that is limited in extent and characterized by sharply demarcated, hyperkeratotic plaques.
It can be associated with GJB3 and GJB4.
It was characterized in 1925.

Milax gagates

Milax gagates, known by the common name greenhouse slug, is a species of air-breathing, keeled, land slug, a shell-less terrestrial gastropod mollusk in the family Milacidae.
Description.
The body of "Milax gagates" is an even dark grey to black, although it has somewhat lighter sides. There are no pigment spots. The mantle is relatively large (35-40% of body length), with distinct grooves. The keel is prominent between mantle and posterior end. Skin sculpture is weak. There are 16-17 grooves between keel and pneumostome. The sole of the foot has blackish lateral zones and a lighter medial zone.
"Milax gagates" is up to 50 mm long. Preserved specimen have a length of 25–30 mm and a width of 6–8 mm. The weight of adult slugs ranges from 991.2 mg to 3308.0 mg.
Reproductive system: The penis is rounded, and half as long as the epiphallus. The epiphallus is slightly widened and truncated (as if cut off) at its end. the vas deferens is short (usually not longer than epiphallus), opens asymmetrically at the truncated end of the epiphallus. The atrium is short, and not widened. The accessory gland consist of several elongate glands and is connected to the atrium by some 20 short coiled tubular ducts. The stimulator is narrow, conical, slightly flattened at its end with some papillae.
The stimulator of the similar species "Milax nigricans" has more papillae situated at its base and not near its free end.
Distribution.
The native range of "Milax gagates" was originally from Morocco through Tunisia and southern Spain to southern France and the Balearic Islands.
It is an endangered species in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.
The species may be native to the Canary Islands.
"Milax gagates" has been introduced in the area between Portugal and Galicia, the Atlantic coastlands of France to Belgium, the British Isles, and in many other areas almost worldwide (Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, Japan, Pacific islands, South Africa, Atlantic islands). As an introduced species it now occurs in a number of countries and islands including:
Ecology.
"Milax gagates" lives mostly in cultivated areas, often the coast, and also in forests, shrublands, and natural meadows. It prefers habitats close to water. It hides under stones, moist ground litter and in soil cavities.
It feeds on fresh herbs, including the roots, it can sometimes be a pest of crops such as carrots and potatoes. It is occasionally damaging to gardens and crops in Britain. It is an agricultural pest on soybean, sunflower, and oilseed rape in Argentina.
In Britain copulation takes place during the period from spring to autumn. During copulation both slugs cling together so closely that no everted genitalia are visible. Under laboratory conditions, the first eggs are laid 5–15 days after copulation. At one time approximately 15 eggs are laid. This can be repeated several times, but in total not more than 100 eggs are laid by one individual. The dimensions of the eggs are 2 × 1.5 mm. Self-fertilization is also possible.
The slug is semelparous, dying 15 to 30 days after laying eggs. Juveniles hatch after at least 25 to 30 days. Maturity is reached in 4 to 5 months under laboratory conditions.

Angelo Decembrio

Angelo Decembrio (1415 — after 1467) was a Milanese humanist who began his career in Ferrara, where he arrived in 1430. The son of Uberto Decembrio, who was the first Renaissance translator of Plato's "Republic", and outshone among his contemporaries by his brother Pier Candido, Angelo is known especially for the seven books of literary dialogues of "De politiæ litterariæ" ("On literary polish", not printed until 1540), which provide a vivid record— though synthesized in retrospect— of literary life at the court of Leonello d'Este of Ferrara, Taking as its main concern the question of how to achieve and maintain the literary polish characteristic of the civilized man in a courtly environment, Decembrio’s unique dialogues elaborating aspects of this central idea take as "personae" his patron Leonello d'Este, who serves as the questioner, with the great teacher Guarino of Verona, Leonello's former tutor; the architect, theorist and humanist Leon Battista Alberti; the poet Tito Vespasiano Strozzi. They debate the comparative value of ancient and modern poetry, discuss the quality of works of art, examine the Egyptian obelisk that still stands in Vatican City in the Piazza S. Pietro; and describe the ideal renaissance library and how it should be organized.
Two manuscript versions of Decembrio's "Politia litteraria" were kept in the Vatican Library; from one that was stolen and subsequently lost, the edition of 1540 was printed; the other remains in the Vatican.
After Leonello's unexpected death (1450) Angelo sought patronage elsewhere, moving first to Barcelona, then spending time at the Neapolitan court of Alfonso the Great of Aragon, where his brother also served, and returning to Barcelona after Alfonso's death in 1458, at the invitation of Carlos de Aragon, Prince de Viana. On his return trip to Ferrara, travelling with the books he had accumulated, he was robbed by bandits working for Jacques d'Armagnac, itemizing his losses in a petition to Borso d'Este, brother of Leonello and himself a great patron of humanistic learning.
In 1467 he was offered a chair in Greek at the University of Perugia, but it is doubtful whether he took it up, and afterwards he disappears from view.

Monarchies in Oceania

There are presently six monarchies in Oceania; that is: self-governing sovereign states in Oceania where supreme power resides with an individual hereditary head, who is recognised as the head of state. Each is a constitutional monarchy, wherein the sovereign inherits his or her office, usually keeps it until death or abdication, and is bound by laws and customs in the exercise of their powers. Five of these independent states share Queen Elizabeth II as their respective head of state, making them part of a global grouping known as the Commonwealth realms; in addition, all monarchies of Oceania are members of the Commonwealth of Nations. The only sovereign monarchy in Oceania that does not share a monarch with another state is Tonga. Australia and New Zealand have dependencies within the region and outside it, although four non-sovereign constituent monarchs are recognized by New Zealand and France.
Current monarchies.
Australia.
The Australian monarchy goes back a few hundred years. European explorers started encountering the continent of Australia from the early 17th century, and the Kingdom of Great Britain founded and peopled colonial settlement from 1788. Before the European settlement an estimated half-million Australian Aborigines formed hundreds of different social groupings. Eventually the British government granted Australians more and more powers to govern themselves. On 9 July 1900, in one of her last acts before she died on 22 January 1901, Queen Victoria gave the royal assent to the "Commonwealth of Australia Act"
which would give Australia its own federal constitution and government. On 1 January 1901 the Governor General, Lord Hopetoun declared the federation of six Australian states and several territories in Centennial Park, Sydney. 30 years following that the Statute of Westminster granted equality to the realms and finally on 3 March 1986 Australia Act (in the United Kingdom and Australia) gave full independence to Australia in theory, although in practice it was already operating mostly independently.
In 1999 Australia held a referendum on whether to become a republic or not; the referendum resulted in the retention of the Australian monarchy. The majority of all voters and all states rejected the proposal.
The realm of Australia comprises six federated states and three federal territories (including the Jervis Bay Territory). It also includes a number of external territories administered by the federal government: Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, Norfolk Island, and the Australian Antarctic Territory.
New Zealand.
The Realm of New Zealand also includes two associated states, Niue and the Cook Islands, and the territories of Tokelau and the Ross Dependency (New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica). All share the Queen of New Zealand as head of state.
Papua New Guinea.
The monarchy of Papua New Guinea (the Papua New Guinean Monarchy) is a system of government in which a hereditary monarch is the head of state. The present monarch of Papua New Guinea is Queen Elizabeth II. The monarch is constitutionally represented by the Governor-General of Papua New Guinea, whose roles and powers are laid out by the Constitution of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea.
After being ruled by three external powers since 1884, Papua New Guinea gained its independence from Australia in 1975. It chose to become a kingdom with its own Queen and monarchy.
Solomon Islands.
The Head of State of the Solomon Islands is Queen Elizabeth II. The Solomon Islands share the Sovereign with a number of Commonwealth realms. The Queen's constitutional roles have been almost entirely delegated to the Governor-General of the Solomon Islands. Royal succession is governed by the English Act of Settlement of 1701, which is part of constitutional law.
On all matters of the Solomon Island State, the Monarch is advised solely by Solomon Island ministers, not British or otherwise.
Tonga.
The House of Tupou was officially formed in 1875 when the monarch's constitutional role was put forth.
In July 2008, three days before his coronation, King George Tupou V announced that he would relinquish most of his power and be guided by his Prime Minister's recommendations on most matters.
The current monarch is Tupou VI.
Tuvalu.
The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesian people. The islands came under the UK's sphere of influence in the late 19th century. The Ellice Islands were administered by Britain as part of a protectorate from 1892 to 1916 and as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony from 1916 to 1974. In 1974 the Ellice Islanders voted for separate British dependency status as Tuvalu, separating from the Gilbert Islands which became Kiribati upon independence. Tuvalu became fully independent within The Commonwealth in 1978.
A constitutional referendum held on 30 April 2008 turned out 1,260 to 679 votes in favour of retaining the monarchy.
Wallis and Futuna.
Wallis and Futuna is an overseas collectivity of the French Republic in Polynesia consisting of three main islands (Wallis, Futuna, and the mostly uninhabited Alofi) and a number of tiny islets. The collectivity is made up of three traditional kingdoms: `Uvea, on the island of Wallis, Sigave, on the western part of the island of Futuna, and Alo, on the island of Alofi and on the eastern part of the island of Futuna. The current King of Uvea is Kapiliele Faupala and the current King of Sigave is Visesio Moeliku. They have reigned since 2008 and 2004, respectively. The throne of Alo is currently vacant, as the last King, Petelo Vikena, crowned in 2008, abdicated on January 22, 2010, and the Council of Chiefs has yet to choose a new King.
The territory was annexed by the French Republic in 1888, and was placed under the authority of another French colony, New Caledonia. The inhabitants of the islands voted in a 1959 referendum to become an overseas collectivity of France, effective in 1961. The collectivity is governed as a parliamentary republic, the citizens elect a Territorial Assembly, the President of which becomes head of government. His cabinet, the Council of the Territory, is made up of the three Kings and three appointed ministers. In addition to this limited parliamentary role the Kings play, the individual kingdoms' customary legal systems have some jurisdiction in areas of civil law.

Tony Strudwick

Tony Strudwick is an English football coach who is employed by Manchester United as the club's fitness coach. Strudwick has a PhD in sports science, which he earned from Liverpool John Moores University.
Strudwick began his football career as a player with Colchester United, but did not make a first team appearance for the club. He gave up playing soon after and moved into coaching. He had previously worked with Coventry City, West Ham United and The Football Association before becoming one of Mark Hughes' first appointments when he took over as manager of Blackburn Rovers in 2004. Strudwick was at Blackburn for three seasons, before Manchester United approached him as a replacement for their outgoing fitness coach, Valter Di Salvo, in the summer of 2007.
In April 2008, Strudwick was involved in an altercation between some of Manchester United's players, including Patrice Evra and Gary Neville, and the ground staff at Chelsea. During a warm-down led by Strudwick, it was claimed by Chelsea's head groundsman, Jason Griffin, that Strudwick had become abusive and foul-mouthed when asked not to warm down in the penalty area. Strudwick counter-claimed that Griffin had been less than polite in asking the players not to warm down in the penalty area, alleging that Griffin was "instantly aggressive" and that he had threatened to "shove the fucking fork was carrying a pitchfork at the time up [Strudwick's] arse".

<doc id="20794754" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20794754" title="Echo answer">
Echo answer

In linguistics, an echo answer or echo response is a way of answering a polar question without using words for yes and no. The verb used in the question is simply echoed in the answer, negated if the answer has a negative truth-value. For examples:
Finnish.
The Finnish language is one language that employs echo answers in response to yes-no questions. It does not answer them with either adverbs or interjections. So the answer to "Tuletteko kaupungista?" ("Are you coming from town?") is the verb form itself, "Tulemme." ("We are coming."). Negatively-phrased questions are answered similarly. Negative answers use the negative verb "en" in coordination with the infinitive. The negative answer to "Tunnetteko herra Lehdon?" ("Do you know Mr Lehto?") is "En tunne" ("I don't know.") or simply "En" ("I don't.").
Celtic languages.
The Celtic languages also primarily employ echo answers. Irish and Scottish Gaelic lack the words "yes" and "no" altogether. In Welsh, the words for "yes" and "no" ("ie" and "nage") are restricted to specialized circumstances. Like Finnish, the main way in these languages to state yes or no, in answer to yes-no questions, is to echo the verb of the question. In Irish, the question "An dtiocfaidh tú?" ("Will you come?") will be answered with "Tiocfaidh" ("will come") or "Ní thiocfaidh" ("[I will not come"). (In Hiberno-English, it is the auxiliary that is echoed: the English question "Will you come?" is often answered in Ireland with "I will" instead of "Yes", or "I will not" instead of "no".)
Similarly, in Welsh, the answers to "Ydy Fred yn dod?" ("Is Fred coming?") are either "Ydy" ("is") or "Nag ydy" ("[He is not"). In general, the negative answer is the positive answer combined with "nag". As in Finnish, this avoids the issue of what an unadorned "yes" means in response to a negative question. Whilst a "yes" response to the question "You don't beat your wife?" is ambiguous in English, the Welsh response "nag ydw" has no ambiguity.
Latin.
Latin, which has no single words for "yes" and "no", also employs echo answers. For example:
Portuguese.
The Portuguese language is the only major Romance language to use echo answers often, even if it has words for "yes" and "no" proper ("sim" and "não" respectively.). Portuguese will most commonly answer a polar question in the affirmative by repeating the main verb.
For example, one would answer the question, "Tens fome?" ("Are you hungry?" or transliterated as "Do you have hunger?") by simply replying, "tenho" (" have"). One could also add "sim" before or after the verb for the use of emphasis, or to contradict a negative question; producing "sim, tenho" or "tenho sim". In order to produce a "negative" answer to a polar question, the verb is repeated followed by "não" before or after it. Thus, a negative answer to our above question would be: "Não tenho," "Tenho não," or "Não tenho fome." For emphasis, one could even say, "Não tenho, não."
Mandarin Chinese.
Mandarin Chinese often employs echo answers. Often yes-no questions in Mandarin are expressed in the A-not-A form, and are answered with either A or not-A. For example:
In addition, often yes-no questions are formed by adding the particle "ma" ("yes or no?") to the end of a sentence, in which case the answer can be "shì de" ("is (so)") or "bu shì" ("not is (so)"), or "duì" ("right") or "bu duì" (not right"):

World Series Baseball 2K1

World Series Baseball 2K1 is a sports video game developed by Wow Entertainment and published by Sega for the Dreamcast. It was the first game in the modern series to be featured on the Dreamcast, and was the spiritual successor to World Series Baseball for the Sega Genesis. It was released in July 2000 to coincide with the 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Atlanta.
"World Series Baseball 2K1" featured a cutting-edge graphical presentation adapted from the NAOMI game "Super Major League", and its visuals were well ahead of any other baseball game at the time. Unfortunately, a lack of features, shoddy audio presentation, and major gameplay flaws meant that "WSB2K1" was not well received by critics despite its fantastic graphics. The game is notorious for its sometimes-unresponsive controls, as well as the fact that manual fielding—a staple of baseball games for a half-decade prior to "WSB2K1"'s release—isn't even an option available to players.
After the debacle that was "World Series Baseball 2K1", Sega decided to bring Visual Concepts (the developer behind the Dreamcast's far more successful "NBA 2K" and "NFL 2K" series) in for the next version of the game. The result was "World Series Baseball 2K2", a game that was considered a major improvement over "WSB2K1".

Army Men II

Army Men II, released in 1999 is the second game in the long running Army Men video game franchise from The 3DO Company and a direct sequel to 1998's Army Men. The game differs from the first one in that it has battles in both the "real world" and the "plastic world." It is also the first to introduce the concept of portals between our world and their world. A topic that was expanded on in later games.
Plot.
Background.
In Army Men I The Tan commander Plastero, invades the green lands. at the end sarge races the tan forces to a portal and enters, finding himself in a Kitchen. The game begins with a massive tan force including Plastero himself chasing him through the portal. Major Mylar betrays Plastero, destroys the portal as he enters it and takes control of the tan army and territories.
Levels.
The game continues from the kitchen with Sarge and a small squad fighting their way across the kitchen counter, finding a portal back to the plastic Jungle (Level 1). Securing a radio installation, Sarge contacts HQ for instructions (Level 2), using which he wins a tank fight(Level 3), save a blue spy from the tan forces and escapes through an airfield(Level 4).
In search for a missing colonel in plastic tropical islands, Sarge finds soldiers from all four armies banded together in what is called "the Cult". Colonel, gone mad, is found to be the leader of this cult (Level 5). He escapes through a portal and is followed by Sarge into a front yard where he is taken out by Sarge himself (Level 6).
Sarge's plane is shoot down into a plastic tropical island full of zombies created by Dr. Madd, an insane Grey scientist working for the Tan Army, who creates Cult forces by injecting different color liquids to soldiers. Sarge destroys the zombie mold factory generators (Level 7) and chases Dr. Madd to a desert where he must take out other scientists (Level 8). He then goes through another portal to a hobby table in a garage to stop several scientists from escaping back into the plastic world (Level 9). Through a portal he emerges at a forested, middle-of-nowhere tan base to fight the last enemy scientists protected by zombies, suicide bombers, etc. (Level 10)
Sarge finally attacks the tan fortress, evades a massive wave of angry soldiers, rescues the blue spy, finds a key leading to a weapon of mass destruction located in the center of the fortress. bombs and destroys it before the tans use it, and goes out through a portal (Level 11) to Mylar's HQ in a child's bedroom, crawling with tan soldiers. He takes out Major Mylar on a fortress-like playset (Level 12).
Epilogue.
In the closing movie, the greens swoop in, taking out the remaining tans and enjoying a major victory for the Green Army. On top of a nightstand or dresser, General Plastro can be seen spying on them. Under his breath, he "thanks" the greens for getting rid of Mylar, and "encourages" them to enjoy their victory for now. Laughing maniacally, he says that he something special planned for next time.
An ominous scene involving Dr. Madd working on the remains of Mylar in his lab concludes the ending movie.
Reception.
Overall the game received good to mixed reviews. GameSpot called it a fun game, but also said that it's "not all it could have been." The game is improved comparing to Army Men. New weapons, vehicles, enemies, landscapes, squad member experience feature, switching between real and plastic world, and better controls are praised. but the soldiers can't find path well.

State of health

State of health (SOH) is a figure of merit of the condition of a battery (or a cell, or a battery pack), compared to its ideal conditions. The units of SOH are percent points (100% = the battery's conditions match the battery's specifications).
Typically, a battery's SOH will be 100% at the time of manufacture and will decrease over time and use. However, a battery's performance at the time of manufacture may not meet its specifications, in which case its initial SOH will be less than 100%.
SOH evaluation.
Knowing the SOH of a given battery and the SOH threshold of a given application:
Parameters.
As SOH does not correspond to a particular physical quality, there is no consensus in the industry on how SOH should be determined.
The designer of a battery management system may use any of the following parameters (singly or in combination) to derive an arbitrary value for the SOH.
In addition, the designer of the battery management system defines an arbitrary weight for each of the parameter's contribution to the SOH value. The definition of how SOH is evaluated can be a trade secret.
SOH threshold.
As stated before, the method by which the battery management system evaluates the SOH of a battery is arbitrary.
Similarly, the SOH threshold below which an application deems a particular battery unsuitable is also arbitrary; a given application may accept a battery with a SOH of 50% and above, while a more critical application may only accept batteries with an SOH of 90% and above.

Broad Creek originates on the west side of Constitution Road about 500 feet south of the Pennsylvania state line. It runs generally southeast through Pylesville, Maryland for the first half, then northeast for the second half of its to the Conowingo Reservoir portion of the Susquehanna. 
It flows through just two properties in its lower five miles, that of the Baltimore Area Council, B.S.A. and then the Exelon power company. In its three mile course through Broad Creek Memorial Scout Reservation, it is dammed to create Lake Aaron Straus and passes close to the Late Archaic Period Broad Creek Soapstone Quarries archaeological site. Downstream from the 1948 Boy Scout dam, the creek forms a noteworthy gorge through the largest and oldest eastern hemlock grove in the state east of the Allegheny Front. At the east edge of the reservation, about two miles from its mouth, the creek meets the headwaters of the reservoir.

Paul James (gardener)

Paul James is a TV gardener from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Known as "The Gardener Guy," he has been the host of the HGTV show "Gardening by the Yard" since 1996. He is the creator, writer and senior producer and shoots almost the entire show in his own backyard.
In the late 1980s, James began doing a gardening segment on a Tulsa CBS station. A few years later James read an article that HGTV was being launched. He called Scripps Howard Broadcasting and asked for a meeting. James was told if he could get to their headquarters they would meet with him. He did and "Gardening by the Yard" was born.
James' show explores topics familiar to the average home gardener, such as lawn care, growing vegetables, pruning trees, and instilling an interest in gardening in young people, in an informative yet light and irreverent style. Nearly all of his pre-2000 shows were filmed on his Tulsa property, and James produced most of the show's content himself. Later episodes usually included one or more segments by a respected lawn and garden expert and devoted more attention to organic gardening and topics that were more upscale or technical. All episodes of "Gardening by the Yard" made in 2000 or later were produced by Screaming Flea Productions.
James took master gardener training in 1983. James states he has a book deal in the works.
James is a married father of three. In addition to his work on "Gardening by the Yard", James has hosted numerous HGTV specials, including a Rose Bowl Parade, as well as a short-lived cooking show ("Paul James' Homegrown Cooking") that ran from 1998 to 2000.
In 2004, in an interview with "Canadian Gardening" magazine, Paul James stated that his favorite mythical creature is a phoenix because it represents the growth and rebirth of life, which he says plays an important part in gardening.
2009 was the last year of "Gardening by the Yard" as the show was not renewed. His official website is still live but has been effectively shut down as he decided to stop updating it.
Paul James often visits the Hollywood Garden Club in Florida, where he spends much of his time contributing to the gardens there. He once humorously remarked, "if I could choose to do anything, I would spend my time at the Garden Club with a pet phoenix at my side."

The VSS

The VSS was an American rock band from Boulder, Colorado.
History.
The VSS formed in 1995 after the breakup of the hardcore group Angel Hair. Vocalist Sonny Kay and guitarist Josh Hughes had both played in Angel Hair; the rest of the lineup consisted of bassist Andrew Douglas Rothbard and Dave Clifford. They quickly released several 7" records and toured the United States, achieving nationwide notice among the underground punk scene with acclaim from publications like "Maximum Rocknroll" and "Flipside". Midway through their career, the band relocated to San Francisco. Their only full-length, "Nervous Circuits", was released on Honey Bear Records in 1997, and the group broke up shortly thereafter.
Sonny Kay went on to sing with Year Future and founded the label Gold Standard Laboratories, which re-released their Gravity 7" records as a CD entitled "21:51" in 2000. Dave Clifford, Josh Hughes, and Andrew Douglas Rothbard formed a new group called Slaves, which changed its name to Pleasure Forever, and released two full length LP's on Sub Pop records. Dave Clifford later played with Red Sparowes. Josh Hughes went on to form the band Rabbits, and Andrew Douglas Rothbard has released several solo albums.
Their use of synthesizers and keyboards in a hardcore punk setting was uncommon for its time, but has been recognized as an influence on bands such as The Faint and Death From Above 1979. In 2008, Hydra Head Records re-released "Nervous Circuits" on CD with a bonus DVD, as well as an additional bonus CD with the first 1,000 copies.

History of the College of William &amp; Mary

The history of The College of William & Mary can be traced back to a 1693 royal charter establishing "a perpetual College of Divinity, Philosophy, Languages, and the good arts and sciences" in the British Colony of Virginia. It was named for the reigning joint monarchs of Great Britain, King William III and Queen Mary II. The selection of the new college's location on high ground at the center ridge of the Virginia Peninsula at the tiny community of Middle Plantation is credited to its first President, Reverend Dr. James Blair, who was also the Commissary of the Bishop of London in Virginia. A few years later, the favorable location and resources of the new school helped Dr. Blair and a committee of 5 students influence the House of Burgesses and Governor Francis Nicholson to move the capital there from Jamestown. The following year, 1699, the town was renamed Williamsburg.
During the American Revolution about 75 years later, the college successfully made the transition from British support and a role in government and the established church under Bishop James Madison, and added post graduate programs including the School of Law under George Wythe to become a "university" (although the traditional name using the word "college" has always been retained). With buildings and finances both devastated by the American Civil War (1861–1865), through the perseverance of school presidents Benjamin Stoddert Ewell and Lyon Gardiner Tyler, funding from the U.S. Congress and the Commonwealth of Virginia eventually restored the infrastructure and facilitated expansion of the school's programs with a new emphasis on educating teachers for the state's new public school divisions.
In 1918, William and Mary became the first of Virginia's state-supported colleges and universities to admit women as well as men to its under graduate programs. Adjacent to the restored colonial capital area which became Colonial Williamsburg beginning in 1926, the school has long been involved in the programs and work there. A few blocks away from the campus in the Historic Area, many students continue to attend Bruton Parish Church, a tradition of over 300 years duration.
Prologue.
The first permanent settlement in the British Colony of Virginia was established at Jamestown in 1607 as a business venture funded by the Virginia Company of London and to replenish the British Crown Treasury. The role of the Protestant Church of England and its relationship to the monarchy government had been established in the 1530s by King Henry VIII, when he broke with the Papacy in Rome. In the Acts of Supremacy, Henry abandoned Rome completely, asserted the independence of the "Ecclesia Anglicana" and appointed himself and his successors as the supreme rulers of the English church. This sovereign relationship was later established when the original colony became an official royal colony in 1624. The primary leaders of the colony, from the Virginia Company of London, and the accompanying clergy believed they could bring "Ecclesia Anglicana", the beliefs of the British Empire, to the Native Americans in the new colony. The spiritual beliefs of the Native Americans differed from the colonists and were incorrectly assumed by colonists as a lack of education and literacy, due to the indigenous Powhatan people who lived in the area, that they called "Tsenacommacah", which used Mesoamerican writing systems of petroglyph, pictogram and petroform. The colonists assumed teaching English literacy would result in what the English saw as enlightenment in civil and religious practices, and bring them into the fold as English subjects.
In November 1618, the Virginia Company of London gave orders for university grounds to be laid at Henrico, 12 miles from the current city of Richmond, to include an Indian School branch, and endowed it with 10,000 acres of land. A school of higher education for both Native American young men and the sons of the colonists was one of the earliest goals of the leaders of the Virginia Colony. In May 1619, the treasurer of the Virginia Company, Sir Edwin Sandys, reported that funds had been collected toward the proposed college. The Virginia General Assembly, established July 30, 1619, proceeded on July 31, 1619, to petition the Virginia Company for workmen from England to build the College. In May 1620, the Virginia Company appointed George Thorpe to be first deputy in charge of the College lands. Within the first decade, a promising start of a "University" was initiated as part of the progressive colonial outpost of Henricus under the leadership of Sir Thomas Dale. In March 1622, Thorpe was killed and Henrico destroyed, postponing the College, in an Indian uprising of the Indian Massacre of 1622. In 1624, the College plans were abandoned when the charter of the Virginia Company was revoked and Jamestown became a royal colony. It would be almost 70 more years before their efforts to establish a school of higher education would be successful. In 1661 the College and free school land purchase was authorized by an act passed by The General Assembly but no progress was made. In July 1690 the College was proposed again and subscriptions in Virginia were authorized by Lieutenant Governor Francis Nicholson with a financial support appeal to Virginia traders who were merchants in England. In May 1691 The General Assembly issued instructions for the founding of the College to Reverend James Blair, the representative of the Bishop of London, sending him to England to present the request to the King and Queen to grant a charter for the College.
Founding.
In 1691, with instruction from the House of Burgesses, Reverend Dr. James Blair, arrived in England to secure the charter to re-establish a school of higher education. Some scholars believe Blair utilized some of the original plans from the elaborate but ill-fated earlier attempt at Henricus. Reverend Blair, as the representative for the Bishop of London in the colony, journeyed to London. Control of the Native Americans of the Powhatan Confederacy was no longer a priority in the Colony, as they had been largely decimated and reduced to reservations after the last major conflict in 1644. However, establishing the Jamestown College and assimilating Native Americans in general was retained as a vital part of the school's mission, as possible moral and political incentives to help successfully gain approval in London. Henry Compton, the current Bishop of London, John Tillotson (Archbishop of Canterbury), and others supported Blair's assignment from the Virginia Colony to secure the charter for the College.
The College was founded on February 8, 1693, under a royal charter (technically, by letters patent) granted by King William III and Queen Mary II, to establish The College of William and Mary in Virginia to ""make, found and establish a certain Place of Universal Study, a perpetual College of Divinity, Philosophy, Languages, and the good arts and sciences...to be supported and maintained, in all time coming."" Named in honor of the reigning monarchs King William III and Queen Mary II, the College is the second oldest in the United States and was one of the original Colonial colleges. The Charter named Blair as the College's first president (a lifetime appointment which he held until his death in 1743). The King provided funds allocated from tobacco taxes, along with the Surveyor-General's Office "profits" and 10,000 acres each in the Pamunkey Neck and on Blackwater Swamp. Founded as an Anglican institution; governors were required to be members of the Church of England, and professors were required to declare adherence to the Thirty-Nine Articles. The charter called for a center of higher education consisting of three schools: the Grammar School, the Philosophy School and the Divinity School. The Philosophy School instructed students in the advanced study of moral philosophy (logic, rhetoric, ethics) as well as natural philosophy (physics, metaphysics, and mathematics); upon completion of this coursework, the Divinity School prepared these young men for ordination into the Church of England.
This early curriculum, a precursor to the present-day liberal arts program, made William & Mary the first American college with a full faculty. The College has achieved many other notable academic firsts. Although most other planned goals were met or exceeded, the efforts to educate and convert the natives to Christianity were to prove less than successful once the College was established.
Colonial history.
In November 1693, the College was given a seat in the House of Burgesses and the General Assembly passed the act to establish the College site "as near the church now standing in Middle Plantation old fields as convenience will permit", and on the same day voted on funding for the College to be supported by tobacco taxes and an export duty on furs and skins. "Middle Plantation" was changed to "Williamsburg" in 1699 when the colonial capital was moved there from Jamestown. The peaceful situation with the Native Americans in the Virginia Peninsula area by that time, as well as the central location in the developed portion of the colony located only about from Jamestown, but on high ground midway between the James and York Rivers, must have appealed to the College's first president, for he is credited with selecting a site for the new college on the western outskirts of the tiny community of Middle Plantation in James City County.
In December 1693 a tract of was purchased from Captain Thomas Ballard, the proprietor of Rich Neck Plantation, in the amount of £170 for the College site just a short distance from the almost new brick Bruton Parish Church, a focal point of the extant community, and not far from the headwaters of Archer's Hope Creek, later renamed College Creek. 
The College library contains two of the boundary stones erected in 1694 that marked the property, which are available for viewing.
In May 1694 the College of Arms in London granted The College's coat of arms, described as: "Vert a Colledge, or Edifice mason'd Argent in Chief a Sun rising Or the Hemisphere proper," i.e., a college building in silver, on a green field; a golden sun at half orb against a blue sky. The new school opened in temporary buildings. Properly called the "College Building," the first version of the Wren Building was built at Middle Plantation on a picturesque site. On August 8, 1695, the laying of the first foundation bricks, later called the Main Building, were attended by Governor Edmund Andros and the Council of Virginia. It was renamed the Sir Christopher Wren Building between 1928 and 1931 when it was restored. In 1700 the front and the north wing were completed. The present-day College still stands upon those grounds, adjacent to and just west of the restored historic area known in modern times as Colonial Williamsburg.
After the statehouse at Jamestown burned in 1698, the legislature moved temporarily to Middle Plantation, as it had in the past. On May 1, 1699, the College held a May Day celebration, with the House of Burgess members in attendance by invitation of Governor Nicholson. On display for the Burgesses were examples "of the Improvement of your Youth in Learning and Education", along with five student speeches, including one extolling the advantages for the site of the capital as Williamsburg. The capital was permanently relocated there, and Middle Plantation was renamed Williamsburg in 1699. Following its designation as the Capital of the Colony, immediate provision was made for construction of a capitol building and for platting the new city according to the survey of Theodorick Bland. Both the extant Bruton Parish Church and the College Building held prominent locations in the new plan, with the Wren Building site aligned at the center of the western end of the new major central roadway, Duke of Gloucester Street, itself laid along a pathway running along the midpoint ridge of the Peninsula and long a dividing line between two of the original eight shires of Virginia, York and James City Counties. At the other (eastern) end of the Duke of Gloucester Street, opposite the College Building, the new Capitol was built.
Williamsburg, which was granted a royal charter as a city in 1722, served as the capital of Colonial Virginia from 1699 to 1780. During this time, the College served as a law center and lawmakers frequently used its buildings. It educated future U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and John Tyler. The College issued George Washington his surveyor's certificate, which led to his first public office. Washington was later appointed the first American Chancellor in 1788 following the American Revolution. Serving as Chancellor of the College was to be his last public office, one he held until his death in 1799.
George Wythe, widely regarded as a pioneer in American legal education, attended the College as a young man, but dropped out unable to afford the fees. Wythe went on to become one of the more distinguished jurists of his time. Jefferson, who later referred to Wythe as "my second father," studied under Wythe from 1762 to 1767. By 1779, Wythe held the nation's first Law Professorship at the College. Wythe's other students included Henry Clay, James Monroe and John Marshall.
The College also educated three U.S. Supreme Court Justices (John Marshall, Philip Pendleton Barbour and Bushrod Washington) as well as several important members of government including Peyton Randolph and Henry Clay.
Separation from England.
During the period of the American Revolution, Freedom of Religion and the Separation of Church and State were each established in Virginia beginning in 1776. The English government and the Church of England each lost prominence and control. While they desired independent government, leaders and citizens of the new state and country did not reject their church, only its structure in relationship to government. Worship continued during the difficult years of the War and thereafter. Although shorn of a governmental role and financial support, the Church survived in modified form as what is now known as The Episcopal Church (United States). Before the Revolution, there had been no bishop in the colony. After the War, the first Episcopal Bishop of Virginia was the Right Reverend James Madison (1749–1812). He was a cousin of future President of the United States James Madison, and was ordained in England just before the American Revolution.
Future U.S. President James Madison was a key figure in the transition to religious freedom in Virginia, and Reverend Madison, his cousin and Thomas Jefferson, who was on the Board of Visitors, helped The College of William & Mary to make the transition as well, and to become a university with the establishment of the graduate schools in law and medicine in the process.
A 1771 graduate of the College, and an ordained minister in the Church of England, Reverend James Madison was a teacher at William & Mary as the hostilities of the American Revolution broke out, and he organized his students into a local militia. During 1777, he served as chaplain of the Virginia House of Delegates. The same year, Loyalist sympathies of the College President, Reverend John Camm (who had been the initial litigant in the Parson's Cause case 1758-1764), brought about his removal from the faculty. Reverend Madison became the 8th president of The College of William & Mary in October, 1777, the first after separation from England.
As its President, Reverend Madison worked with the new leaders of Virginia, most notably Jefferson, on a reorganization and changes for the College which included the abolition of the Divinity School and the Indian School, which was also known as the Brafferton School. The 1693 royal charter provided that Indian School of the College educate American Indian youth. College founder James Blair had arranged financing for that purpose using income from Brafferton Manor in Yorkshire, England, which had passed to the estate of scientist Robert Boyle. The Indian School, intended to "civilize" Indian youth, was begun in 1700. However, Native American parents resisted enrolling and boarding their children, and many of those who enrolled were captive children from enemy tribes, including the first six students. Enrollment was never strong, revived somewhat after construction of the fine brick Brafferton School building in 1723. The school was never very successful in achieving any quantity of Indian conversions to Christianity, but did help educate several generations of interpreters who could aid in communication. The school's dedicated income from England was interrupted by the Revolutionary War. By 1779, the Brafferton School had permanently closed, although "The Brafferton", as it is known in modern times, remains a landmark building on the campus.
In June 1781, as British troops moved down the Peninsula, Lord Cornwallis made the president's house his headquarters, and the institution was closed for a few months of that year, which saw the surrender at Yorktown on October 19.
Antebellum era 1776–1861.
The colonies declared their independence in 1776 and the College of William & Mary severed formal ties to England. However, the College's connection to British history remains as a distinct point of pride; it maintains a relationship with the British monarchy and includes former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher among those who have served as Chancellors. Queen Elizabeth II has visited the College twice.
In 1842, alumni of the College formed the Society of the Alumni which is now the sixth oldest alumni organization in the United States. In 1859, a great fire caused destruction to the College. The Alumni House is one of only several original antebellum structures remaining on campus; notable others include the Wren Building, the President's House, and the Brafferton.
Civil War, Reconstruction, becoming a state institution.
At the outset of the American Civil War (1861–1865), enlistments in the Confederate Army depleted the student body and on May 10, 1861, the faculty voted to close the College for the duration of the conflict. The College Building was used as a Confederate barracks and later as a hospital, first by Confederate, and later Union forces. The Battle of Williamsburg was fought nearby during the Peninsula Campaign on May 5, 1862, and the city fell to the Union the next day. The Brafferton building of the College was used for a time as quarters for the commanding officer of the Union garrison occupying the town. On September 9, 1862, drunken soldiers of the 5th Pennsylvania Cavalry set fire to the College Building, purportedly in an attempt to prevent Confederate snipers from using it for cover. Much damage was done to the community during the Union occupation, which lasted until September 1865.
Following restoration of the Union, Virginia was destitute from the War. The College's 16th president, Benjamin Stoddert Ewell finally reopened the school in 1869 using his personal funds. He later sought war reparations from the U.S. Congress, but he was repeatedly put off. Ewell's request was finally honored, and Federal funds were appropriated, but not until 1893. Meanwhile, after some years of struggling, the College closed in 1881 due to lack of funds.
It has become legendary that, every single morning of the long seven-year period between the College's closure in 1881 and reopening in 1888, President Ewell would arise and ring the bell calling students to class, so it could never be said that William and Mary had abandoned its mission to educate the young men of Virginia.
In 1888, William & Mary resumed operations under a substitute charter when the Commonwealth of Virginia passed an act appropriating $10,000 to support the College as a state teacher-training institution. Dr. Ewell, who had grown quite old and spent much of his private financial resources to keep the College alive, was finally able to retire, with the future of his beloved College on a new and more stable course again. He was no doubt honored and satisfied that former U.S. President John Tyler's son would be taking the reins.
20th century: coeducational and teacher training programs.
Lyon Gardiner Tyler (1853–1935) became the 17th president of the College following President Ewell's retirement. Tyler began expanding the College into a modern institution. He assembled a faculty known affectionately as the "Seven Wise Men," himself holding the chair of history. In March 1906 the General Assembly passed an act taking over the grounds of the colonial institution, and it has remained publicly supported ever since.
In 1918, William & Mary was one of the first universities in Virginia to become coeducational with its admission of women. During this time, enrollment increased from 104 students in 1889 to 1269 students by 1932. Tyler retired in 1919 as president.
Lyon Tyler was succeeded by the College's 18th president, J.A.C. Chandler, who continued and greatly expanded the initiatives of that began under Dr. Tyler. Also a historian and author, Dr. Chandler had spent his career prior to coming to William and Mary in Education, and had developed an acclaimed "Model Schools" program at Richmond City Public Schools during the ten years he served there as Superintendent of Schools.
Dr. Chandler was both innovative and energetic. As he continued programs of modernization and coeducation begun under Tyler, he had access to Tyler, who was still living nearby at his home in Charles City County. (Ironically, Dr. Tyler outlived Chandler by a year).
He also can be credited with the recruitment of Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin, who was comfortably serving a wealthy church in Rochester, New York, but as Dr. Chandler knew, still had strong ties and dreams for Williamsburg. Beginning ostensibly at William and Mary as an instructor and fund-raiser, Dr. Goodwin was soon pursuing historical restoration ideas and the funding for them in addition to raising funds for the school's programs in general.
The dedication of William and Mary's new Phi Beta Kappa Hall in 1926 gave Dr. Goodwin the opportunity to spend time with industrialist and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and his wife, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller as they visited Williamsburg with three of their children. 
Dr. Goodwin, who was also rector of Bruton Parish Church, shared his dreams and visions of restoring as much as possible of the birthplace of America's democracy. While his father had been the hard-driving businessman who generated a lot of animosity around the country as he was the "front man" for Standard Oil, his only son, John Jr., was a much more shy and reserved individual whose job it became to be a philanthropist with his wife in handling the family's great wealth. Dr. Goodwin was successful, possibly beyond the wildest dreams of he or Dr. Chandler, in getting John and Abby to become part of the dream that ended up becoming Colonial Williamsburg (CW).
Although most of the Restoration eventually came under a foundation separate from the College, the ties between the College and CW remain close. Notably the restorations/reconstructions of the Sir Christopher Wren Building, the President's House and the Brafferton (the President's office) between 1928 and 1932 were among what was accomplished on the campus itself which was of great benefit to the College
Dr. Chandler had many activities going on in the 1920s other than the Restoration, which became increasingly Dr. Goodwin's principal focus. As a former public school leader, Dr. Chandler knew firsthand of the urgent need in the state for additional efforts to educate teachers and other professionals for the public schools throughout the state.
Despite facing the challenges presented by the Great Depression and his own failing health as the College entered the 1930s, Chandler's greatest legacy at William and Mary is considered by many to be School of Education, which began a long continuing tradition of providing an education to many of Virginia's public school teachers. Although he had left local service there many years earlier, it is symbolic that Richmond Public Schools named a new school after Dr. Chandler shortly after his death, the only former W&M President accorded such an honor in the capital city.
During Dr. Chandler's 14-year tenure, the College's full-time faculty grew to over 100 and the student body grew from 300 to over 1200 students, despite the Depression. Affordable and accessible education was also a hallmark of Chandler's tenure. In 1930, William & Mary expanded its territorial range by establishing a branch in Norfolk, Virginia. This extension would eventually become the independent state-supported institution known as Old Dominion University. Other branches around the state were to follow. Partially as a result, when in competition for state higher education funding, the College has enjoyed an especially supportive relationship with the Virginia General Assembly, which partially funds the various local programs for K-12 public school education throughout the state. The School of Education has continued and expanded that commitment by conducting in-service training and summer programs which enable continuing education of teachers and other instructional personnel. As a result, many of Virginia's public school teachers who utilize these services later achieve masters and doctoral degrees, with some advancing to positions of leadership in school divisions or with the State Department of Education.
Mid 1930s through WW II.
William and Mary's budding "Air School" begun under Dr. Chandler. The College had two different facilities during its short venture into aviation. Both were located originally along what is now VA-Route 603 (Mooretown Road). The newer facility changed to private operation and was the namesake for modern-day Airport Road in York County. The program was a casualty of a combination of the economic environment of the Depression, Dr. Chandler's failing health, and more than any other factor, most likely the changes in a growing technology which quickly shifted to the military and commercial sector.
Significant campus construction continued under the College's nineteenth president, John Stewart Bryan. Son of Joseph Bryan, a prominent Richmonder, John Stewart was a newspaperman and businessman. As Virginia recovered from the Depression, in 1935, the "Sunken Gardens" were constructed, just west of the Wren Building. The sunken design is taken from a similar landscape feature at Chelsea Hospital in London, designed by Sir Christopher Wren.
Post WW-II through modern times.
Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited the College on October 16, 1957, where the Queen spoke to the College community from the balcony of the Wren Building. The Queen again visited the College on May 4, 2007, as part of her state visit for the 400th anniversary of the establishment of the settlement at Jamestown.
In 1974, Jay Winston Johns willed Ash Lawn-Highland, the historic Albemarle County, Virginia estate of alumnus and U.S. President James Monroe, to the College. The College restored this historic Presidential home near Charlottesville and opened it to the public.
Sir Christopher Wren Building.
The building officially referred to as the "Sir Christopher Wren Building" was so named upon its renovation in 1931 to honor the English architect Sir Christopher Wren. The basis for the 1930s name is a 1724 history in which Hugh Jones stated that the 1699 design was "first modelled by Sir Christopher Wren" and then was adapted "by the Gentlemen there" in Virginia; little is known about how it looked, since it burned within a few years of its completion. Today's Wren Building is based on the design of its 1716 replacement. The College's Alumni Association recently published an article suggesting that Wren's connection to the 1931 building is a viable subject of investigation. A follow-up letter clarified the apocryphal nature of the Wren connection.
In the early 20th century, the Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin and John D. Rockefeller Jr. undertook a massive reconstruction and restoration project in Williamsburg—the project culminated in Colonial Williamsburg. The Wren Building was the first major building to be reconstructed or restored as part of the project. Following a drawing on the Bodleian copper plate (ca. 1740) and plans Thomas Jefferson drew of the interior in 1772, the Boston architectural firm of Perry, Shaw & Hepburn rebuilt the building to its second form (1715–1859). The architectural firm subsequently designed complete reconstructions of the Capitol and the Governor's Palace, the original versions of which had burned during the eighteenth century.
Two other buildings around the Wren Building complete a triangle known as "Ancient Campus": the Brafferton (built in 1723 and originally housing the Indian School, now the President and Provost's offices) and the President's House (built in 1732).
The Wren Building is sometimes described as the oldest educational building in continuous use in the United States, although it ceased to serve its original function several times over the centuries. The Wren Building was known in colonial times as "The College" because, in the early years of the institution, the entire College of William & Mary consisted solely of the Wren Building. Inside its hallowed walls, all students (males only at that time) lived, ate, studied, worshiped and learned.
Firsts.
William & Mary is the second-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States, established in 1693 (Harvard is the oldest).
The College was the first to teach Political Economy; Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations" was a required textbook. In the reform of 1779, William & Mary became the first college in America to become a university, establishing faculties of law and medicine; it was also the first college to establish a chair of modern languages. Chemistry was taught beginning in the nineteenth century; alumnus and future Massachusetts Institute of Technology founder William Barton Rogers served as the College's Professor of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry from 1828 to 1835.
Beginning with his 1778 "Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge," alumnus and future University of Virginia founder Thomas Jefferson was involved with efforts to secularize and reform the College's curriculum. Jefferson guided the College to adopt the nation's first elective system of study and to introduce the first student-adjudicated Honor System.
Also at Jefferson's behest, the College appointed his friend and mentor George Wythe as the first Professor of Law in America in 1779. John Marshall, who would later go on to become Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, was one of Wythe's students. The College's Marshall-Wythe School of Law is the oldest law school in the United States.
Along with establishment of new, firmer financial footing, the creation of the graduate schools in law and medicine officially made the "College" a school meeting the contemporary definition of a "university" by 1779, notwithstanding the retention of the original name as set forth in the 1693 Royal Charter.
Secret societies.
The College of William and Mary has a rich tradition of secret societies and is home to the nation's first academic secret society, the Flat Hat Club. Although the pressures of the American Civil War forced many Societies to disappear, most of them were revived during the 20th Century. Some of the secret societies known to currently exist at the College are the Seven Society (Order of the Crown and Dagger), Wren Society, Bishop James Madison Society, Flat Hat Club, Alpha Club, The Society, 13 Club, the Spades, and W Society. In addition to the popular culture notion of secret societies' wealth and extensive alumni networks, William and Mary's focus on the betterment of the College through philanthropy of a clandestine nature.
John Heath and William Short (Class of 1779) founded the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society at William & Mary on December 5, 1776, as a secret literary and philosophical society. Additional chapters were soon established at Yale and at Harvard, and there are now 270 chapters nationwide. Alumni John Marshall and Bushrod Washington were two of the earliest members of Phi Beta Kappa, elected in 1778 and 1780, respectively.

Multiple cutaneous leiomyoma

Multiple cutaneous leiomyomas, also known as Pilar leiomyomas, arise from the arrectores pilorum muscles, and are made up of a poorly circumscribed proliferation of haphazardly arranged smooth muscle fibers located in the dermis that appear to infiltrate the surrounding tissue and may extend into the subcutis.
Sometimes associated with uterine leiomyomas (a combination known as multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis, MCUL), these lesions may also be a manifestation of the hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome.

Songs (Stan Brakhage cycle)

The Songs are a cycle of silent color 8mm films by the American experimental filmmaker Stan Brakhage produced from 1964 to 1969. They are seen as one of Brakhage's major works and include the feature-length "23rd Psalm Branch", considered by some to be one of the filmmaker's masterworks and described by film historian P. Adams Sitney as "an apocalypse of imagination." One of the filmmaker's most overtly political films, "23rd Psalm Branch" is often interpreted as being Brakhage's reaction to the Vietnam War.
Production of the Cycle.
During a 1964 visit to New York City, Brakhage's 16mm film equipment was stolen. Unable to afford the cost of replacing the equipment, Brakhage instead opted to buy cheaper 8mm film equipment, which at the time was being marketed to amateurs to use for home movies. The "Songs" were Brakhage's first works in the medium. Altogether, there are 31 parts to the cycle, all but one of which is numbered in some way. Brakhage would occasionally combine two parts to make one film, making for a total of 25 films, including both parts of "Song 27", which were released separately. Though most of the "Songs" are only a few minutes, some are as long as half an hour and the 23rd part, titled "23rd Psalm Branch", runs 69 minutes. Projected as a series, the cycle runs about 289 minutes.
Starting in 1979, Brakhage released reprinted and revised versions of some of the "Songs" films, including a 16mm version of "23rd Psalm Branch" in two parts. This version runs a total of 78 minutes. In 1987, Brakhage released a 20-minute version of "My Mtn. Song 27", the first half of the cycle's 27th part.

Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Depot – Delmar

The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Depot is an historic structure located in Delmar, Iowa, United States.
History.
The original station was built in Delmar in the 1870s and the present structure was built for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad in 1905. The depot is a rectangular, single story, wood frame building built of a standard design for rural stations. There were waiting rooms (one for men and the other for women) at one end of the depot and a freight room at the other end. While this was not unusual in the Eastern United States, it was a unique design for the Midwest. In between the waiting rooms and the freight room was the station agent's office.
Delmar owes its existence to railroads. Three railroads converged there in the late 1870s and it was named Delmar Junction. Eventually, only the Milwaukee Road remained, and was a strong influence on the development of the town. The depot was located on The Milwaukee Road's mainline from Chicago, Illinois to Omaha, Nebraska.
The depot remained in use until 1977. After that, it remained vacant until it was purchased by the City of Delmar. The last freight train used the station in 1982. Restoration of the building began in 1995 and it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. It now houses the Delmar Depot Museum, which contains a collection of over 1,500 historical items. The site also includes an old caboose named "Elizabeth" and a mural on the old viaduct wall that commemorates the Orphan Train.

Collins College of Hospitality Management

The Collins College of Hospitality Management is a college part of the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona). Founded in 1973, it was the first hospitality management studies program in California and its thousand students make it the largest such school in the state. As of 2010, The Collins College of Hospitality Management is ranked third in the nation by restaurant executives. Andrew Hale Feinstein is Dean and James A. Collins Distinguished Chair. With over 1,000 undergraduate students, the college is the second largest of its kind the country.
Name.
The official name of the college is The Collins College of Hospitality Management, with the definite article "The" part of the college's official name. Publications such as the "Los Angeles Times" and Cal Poly Pomona's electronic magazine "PolyCentric" have referred to the college without "The" as part of the name.
Admissions.
Admissions to The Collins College are on a rolling basis along with all other colleges at the university.
Industry support.
The Collins College is housed in three buildings, which were built with private donations. The college is named after Carol and Jim Collins, who are the primary benefactors of the program. They have given more than $10 million in the last 23 years and in December 2008, they pledged to match $5 million in donations in order to build a new $10 million building. The building would allow the college to accommodate more students and house a graduate studies program.
In November 2010, The J. Willard and Alice S. Marriott Foundation awarded $2 million to The Collins College of Hospitality Management for the academic building expansion. This gift was matched by Carol and Jim Collins.
Hae and Shina Park have also donated more than $2 million to the college. Hae Park, who owns and manages Cal Pacific Realty, is an alumnus of the program. Additional industry support has come from Carl Karcher Enterprises and Marriott Corp.
In December 2010, Eugene Park, son of Hae and Shina, pledged $1 million to the college's academic building expansion. Eugene Park is also an alumnus of the college. The gift was matched by Carol and Jim Collins.
Panda Restaurant Group founders Andrew and Peggy Cherng, donated $2.5 million to The Collins College in 2011.
School to college.
The college was previously named The Collins School of Hospitality Management. In July 2008, Cal Poly Pomona President J. Michael Ortiz designated the school a college. There are only six hospitality management colleges nationwide.
Horsehill Vineyards wine.
The Collins College and the Cal Poly Pomona College of Agriculture partner to produce Horsehill Vineyards wine. The inaugural vintage of Horsehill Vineyards Zinfandel Rosé won the Gold Medal, Best of Class in the Best Rosé Limited Production category at the 70th annual Los Angeles International Wine & Spirits Competition. The 2008 Horsehill Vineyards Zinfandel received a bronze medal. Horsehill Vineyards 2009 Rosé also won a gold medal at the 71st annual Los Angeles International Wine & Spirits Competition.
Horsehill Vineyards wine is made from grapes grown on the Cal Poly Pomona campus and is one of only a few wines made from grapes grown in Los Angeles County, California. The colleges partnered with master winemaker Jon McPherson at South Coast Winery in Temecula, California, to produce and bottle the rosé for the university. Roughly two-thirds of the 2008 harvest yielded 328 cases of Horsehill Vineyards Zinfandel Rosé, which have been sold exclusively at the Collins College's Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch.
Third-generation winemaker Don Galleano used the other third from the 2008 harvest to make a Zinfandel, which aged for about six months in oak barrels at Galleano Winery in Mira Loma, California. The Zinfandel won a bronze in the category Limited Production Zinfandel from 2007 or Later at the 70th annual Los Angeles International Wine & Spirits Competition.
The Zinfandel vines stem from the historic De Ambrogio Ranch, which was razed in 2001 for development in Rancho Cucamonga, California. Geyser Peak Winery made a Zinfandel from the De Ambrogio Vineyard, which was located across the street from what would become the Rancho Cucamonga Civic Center on the corner of Foothill Boulevard (old Route 66) and Haven Avenue. Galleano combed the ranch for the best vines before it was demolished for development. He donated 400 grapevine cuttings to the university.
Proceeds from the wine sales support a culinary garden at Cal Poly Pomona and the ongoing production of Horsehill Vineyards wine. Produce from the garden is incorporated into the menu at the Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch.
Rossana
Cal Poly Pomona’s latest boutique wine, Horsehill Vineyards Rossana Sparkling Wine, is available while supplies
last at the Farm Store at Kellogg Ranch and the Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch for $20 a bottle.
Rossana, named in homage to W.K. Kellogg’s stunning foundation Arabian mare, is a classically styled Brut Rosé.
Zinfandel from Cal Poly Pomona’s Horsehill Vineyards is lightly pressed to capture a nuance of color, all the while Rossana extracting the delicate cherry and strawberry fruit characters. The wine’s bright mauve hue is accentuated with tiny bubbles, a crisp finish, and balanced with just a hint of sweetness. Master winemaker Jon McPherson of South Coast Winery made the wine on behalf of the university.
About the name and history:
Rossana, the mare, was one of the first horses Kellogg brought to the W.K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Ranch, which eventually became Cal Poly Pomona. She had a rose grey coat and nearly faultless conformation. Rossana’s beauty and excellent temperament made her popular with celebrity visitors to the Ranch. She was also one of Kellogg’s favorite mounts, known for her steadiness and dependability, and in his later years he rode her exclusively.
The Zinfandel grapes themselves are a living link to the viticultural heritage of the region. The grapes, which grow on campus, have been cultivated from cuttings from the historic De Ambrogio Ranch Historic photo of the De Ambrogio Ranch
in Rancho Cucamonga. Before the ranch was razed for development in 2001, third-generation vintner
Don Galleano combed the fields and selected 400 grapevine cuttings, some of them nearly
100 years old, and donated them to the university.
Collins Magazine.
The award-winning Collins magazine is published twice a year by The Collins College of Hospitality Management and distributed to alumni and friends of the college. Private endowment funds pay for the magazine. The first issue of Collins magazine and the Collins College’s Web site each received an Award of Excellence in the 2009 APEX Awards for Publication Excellence. The APEX Awards is an annual competition for writers, editors, publications staff, and business and nonprofit communicators. The Fall 2008 issue of Collins won in the New Magazines & Journals category.

The Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch.
Overlooking beautiful, rolling hills, The Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch at Cal Poly Pomona boasts one of the area’s most romantic and chic settings. The Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch is operated and managed by students of The Collins College, serving both lunch and dinner, as a part of their undergraduate degree requirements. The restaurant embodies Cal Poly Pomona’s learn-by-doing tradition and is a central component to The Collins College of Hospitality Management’s curriculum.
The menu at The Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch often features fruits, vegetables and herbs from the restaurant’s culinary garden. Guests can view the one-acre garden while they dine.
Undergraduate students gain experience by providing excellent guest service, preparing quality food, and creating and executing management plans. They rotate weekly through various positions in order to learn all aspects of a hospitality operation.
Unlike most restaurants, the Restaurant at Kellogg Ranch operates as a not-for-profit organization. Financial bookkeeping is managed under the umbrella of the Cal Poly Pomona Foundation, which operates as a public-benefit charitable-educational organization under the provisions of the California Revenue and Taxation Code, Section 23701(d) and the United States Internal Revenue Code, Section 501(c)(3). Gratuities are considered donations to the restaurant and college and are not directly given to student servers. Reservations can be made online through OpenTable or by calling (909) 869-4700.
Expansion Project.
Thanks to more than $10 million in private donations, The Collins College of Hospitality Management is undergoing a significant building expansion.
Construction is set to begin in October 2013, and is projected to be completed by the summer of 2015.
The Collins College Expansion Project comprises two new buildings: a classroom and faculty building and a student commons building. They will be designated as Buildings 72 and 73.
The classroom/faculty building will be used for faculty workspace and classrooms. The faculty workspace will include two executive director offices, an executive admin and lobby space, six faculty offices, a conference room, storage, two 24-station graduate student classrooms, two 48-station lecture rooms and a 32-station lecture room. The student commons will have a graduate student social space, two group study rooms, a spacious student recreation area and a "Grab n' go" food/beverage cart.
"The Collins College Expansion and Upgrades" blog is available online as an interactive tool to keep the public up-to-date with the latest renovations and phases of the expansion project.
Outreach.
The Collins College hosts and participates in numerous outreach events to educate prospective students and high schools about the programs and opportunities it offers.
In November 2012, The Collins College, the CSU Hospitality Management Educational Initiative, and the California Restaurant Association Educational Foundation hosted Experience Hospitality: The Los Angeles High School Summit 2012 at LA Live. More than 150 students from Los Angeles-area high schools got an exclusive tour of LA Live venues - including Katsuya, STAPLES Center, Nokia Theatre and JW Marriott - to show them first-hand what a career in hospitality could look like. The event was sponsored by the California Hotel and Lodging Association Educational Foundation and Levy Restaurants.

Quail Hollow State Park

Quail Hollow State Park is a Ohio state park in Stark County, Ohio, in the United States. The park was opened to the public in 1975. It was previously a privately owned family farm and later a hunting camp. Quail Hollow State Park is open for year-round recreation and features trail that are open to hiking, mountain biking and cross-country skiing, a small pond for fishing and ice skating as well as camping and picnic facilities.
History.
The land in and around Quail Hollow State Park was inhabited by various Indian tribes. The last tribe to call the area home before being forced out by the encroachment of Anglo-American settlers in the Ohio Country were the Lenape, also known as the Delaware.
The first permanent settler in the area was Conrad Brumbaugh. He cleared some land and began farming in the area in 1820. The homestead remained in the Brumbaugh family until 1914, when it was purchased by Harry Bartlett Stewart. Stewart was the chairman of the board of the Akron, Canton and Youngstown Railroad. Initially the Stewarts used homestead for a hunting camp before eventually expanding the home and making their permanent residence on what they called the Minnie Taylor Farm, named for Mr. Stewart's wife, Minnie.
Harry Stewart passed the land onto his son, Harry Bartlett Stewart, Jr. The Stewart's continued to improve the buildings on the Minnie Taylor farm. The original house was expanded into what they called a manor with Greek Revival and Federal architecture influences.
The Stewart's remained at Minnie Taylor farm until 1975 when the sold it to the state of Ohio for half the appraised value. The land was purchased from the Stewarts with financial help from the United States Department of the Interior. Quail Hollow State Park was established on May 15, 1975.
Ecology.
Quail Hollow State Park is in a rich agricultural area. Northeast Ohio is part of the Interior Plains region of North America. The land is largely flat with a few hills that are a remnant of the last ice age. Small glacial lakes, known as kettle lakes are spread throughout the region. These lakes formed when the glaciers gouged out a depression in the land and large clumps of ice broke off the receding glaciers filling the holes and creating lakes.
One of these kettle lakes has shrunk into what is best classified as a bog at Quail Hollow State Park. This bog provides a habitat for and abundance of plants and wildlife. Poison sumac grows in the sphagnum bog. There is a remnant tall grass prairie in the park that supports sneezeweed, blazing star and various other prairie plants. The mixed tree forests of the park provide habitat for White-tailed deer, Spring Peepers, Wild Turkey, Chorus and dGreen Frogs, raccoon, and red foxes.
Recreation.
Quail Hollow State Park is open for year round recreation. There is a primitive campground that is open to large groups such as the Scouts and church youth groups. The campground is remote and it without running water or trash facilities. All water and trash must be carried in and out. The park has 19 miles of trails open to hiking, mountain biking and cross-country skiing. Careful observers will see some wildlife along the trail along with a variety of plant species. There are eight nature trails in the park. Quail Hollow State Park has a five mile horse trail. Shady Lane Pond is open to fishing with a valid Ohio fishing license. The picnic area and playground are near Shady Lane Pond.

Worried at the thought of no overtime, and therefore less wages, he joins forces with his longtime work colleague Jack (Bob Grant) to sabotage the new female employees. Meanwhile, just as his sister Olive (Anna Karen) starts working in the canteen, she discovers that she's expecting a baby. A sub plot explores Olives journey to hospital while in labour in a motorcycle side car and the domestic disturbance the baby brings. Another sub plot explores Stan and Jack's amorous adventures. Stan flees a jealous husband in his bus and demolishes a telephone kiosk and bus shelter in the process. As a result he is forced to undertake a driving test on a bus skid pan.
Stan and Jack join forces to sabotage the new female employees and get back their overtime. They put diuretic in the female bus drivers tea causing them to make frequent loo stops. They terrify them by putting spiders on their buses. Eventually the women resign but Blakey (Stephen Lewis) the bus inspector finally rehires them as assistant inspectors.

Samuel Pailthorpe King

Samuel Pailthorpe King (April 13, 1916 – December 7, 2010) was an American lawyer and judge. Since 1972 he served as judge on the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii.
Life.
King was born April 13, 1916 in Hankow, China while his father was in the United States Navy. His grandfather was ship captain and politician James A. King (1832–1899). He lost his left eye as a child of about six.
After the family returned to Hawaii, he attended and graduated from Punahou School. His mother was part Native Hawaiian Pauline Nawahineokalai Evans.
His father Samuel Wilder King (1886–1959), also part native Hawaiian, later became the delegate to US Congress of the Territory of Hawaii, and then Governor.
He attended Yale University where he received a B.S. in 1937 and Yale Law School, where he graduated with a LL.B. in 1940.
He married Anne van Patten Grilk (born 1921) on July 8, 1944 in Boulder, Colorado. They had a son Samuel Pailthorpe King, Jr., and daughters Louise King Lanzilotti and Charlotte "Becky" King Stretch.
Legal career.
King started in private law practice Washington, DC in 1942. During World War II, he joined the United States Navy as a Japanese language translator from 1942 to 1946, and the Naval Reserve from 1946 to 1967. He returned to private practice of law in Honolulu, Hawaii from 1946 to 1961. He was a District magistrate for the City and County of Honolulu from 1956 to 1961. Governor William F. Quinn appointed him judge to the First Circuit Court of Hawaii from 1961 to 1970, and then a judge on the Family Court of Hawaii from 1966 to 1970. In 1970 he resigned as a judge and ran as a Republican for governor of Hawaii, losing to incumbent John A. Burns.
He returned to private law practice from 1970 to 1972.
King was nominated by Richard M. Nixon on May 22, 1972 to a seat vacated by Cyrus Nils Tavares on the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 28, 1972, and received his commission on June 28, 1972. He served as chief judge from 1974. In 1975 he presided over the case that convicted suspected organized crime leader Wilford Kalaauala "Nappy" Pulawa for tax evasion.
Although there were two judgeships authorized for the district, the other judge, Dick Yin Wong, died in 1978. King had to try all the cases except for occasional help from visiting mainland judges. Walter Meheula Heen was nominated in January 1981 via a recess appointment, but was not confirmed, so by the end of 1981 King was back to being the only judge. In 1983 King suffered temporary amnesia,
and retired to senior status on November 30, 1984.
He continued to hear cases, including a murder trial depicted in the book "And the Sea Will Tell" that took place on remote Palmyra Atoll. The trial moved to California because of pre-trial publicity, and included defense lawyers Vincent Bugliosi and Leonard Weinglass.
He was well known as a mentor to many Hawaii lawyers and judges including U.S. District Judges David A. Ezra, Susan Oki Mollway, and J. Michael Seabright.
In 1997 he joined with other respected senior civic leaders to publish the essay "Broken Trust" in the "Honolulu Star-Bulletin" newspaper. Co-authors were Judge Walter Heen, Monsignor Charles Kekumano, educator Gladys Brandt, and William S. Richardson School of Law Professor Randall W. Roth. The investigation prompted by the report resulted in the reorganization of the Kamehameha Schools. He and Roth co-authored a book expanding the essay, published in 2006.
On December 7, 2010, he died at Kuakini Medical Center from head injuries he received in a fall.
Adrienne King, married to his son Samuel Pailthorpe King, Jr. (both lawyers), ran for Lieutenant governor in 2010 but lost in the Republican primary.

Submerged forest

A submerged forest is the in place ("in situ") remains of trees (especially tree stumps) that lie submerged beneath a bay, sea, ocean, lake, or other body of water. A forest can become submerged as the result of a lake or sea level rise that results in a lacustrine or marine transgression and in place drowning of the forest. A submerged forest that lies beneath a lake can also be formed by the blockage of a river valley by either a landslide or manmade dam. Examples can be found at low tide on the fringes of the submerged landmass known as Doggerland, around the coast of England and Wales, the Channel Islands, north-west France and Denmark. These remains have usually been buried in mud, peat or sand for several thousand years before being uncovered by sea level change and erosion. In some places, such as Blackpool Sands, Dartmouth, the remains are normally covered by sand and only rarely exposed. 
As the North American Laurentide ice sheet began receding for the last time some 10,000 years ago, water levels in the future Great Lakes were sometimes much lower than at present. Forests covered the southern end of what is now Lake Huron. Then as the glaciers melted and waters rose, these forests were inundated and drowned. Today their remnants, well preserved logs and stumps, have been discovered in waters over 200 feet deep.
Another submerged forest has been found in Nantucket Sound, off the coast of the state of Massachusetts.

Gustav Orreus

Gustav Orreus (1738–1811) was a doctor of Finnish-Swedish origin in Imperial Russian service. An early epidemiologist, Orreus distinguished himself during the Russian plague of 1770-1772. He was the first Doctor of Medicine ever to qualify in Russia.
Biography.
Born in Finland (then part of Sweden), Orreus was trained at Åbo and relocated to Russia in 1755. He continued medical training in Moscow and is believed to take part in the Seven Years' War. August 2, 1768 Catherine II of Russia issued the Doctor of Medicine diploma in the name of Orreus, the first of its kind ever issued in Russia.
In the same 1768 Orreus became a surgeon of Pyotr Rumyantsev's headquarters on the Moldavian theater of the 1768-1774 Russo-Turkish War. The southern provinces of Moldavia and Wallachia were infested with plague. Orreus, in charge of disease prevention, persuaded the generals that the disease was indeed plague and not "malignant fever"; he set up basic reconnaissance for plague outbreaks and imposed anti-plague controls that are credited with preventing widespread disease among the troops. However the plague infiltrated mainland Russia, causing the epidemy of 1770–1772 that peaked in Moscow in September and October 1771. Orreus was summoned to Moscow by Grigory Orlov, the statesman placed in charge of emergency anti-plague action. Orlov and Orreus arrived in the city September 26, 1771, at the peak of the outbreak. Orreus was assigned to manage quarantine hospitals in Moscow. At first, he opposed Afanasy Shafonsky and denied the plague nature of Moscow epidemy, but despite bitter medical dispute the course of events persuaded Orreus to admit the facts. He summarized his experience during the plague in a 1784 treatise "Descriptio pestis, quae anno 1770 in Jassia et 1771 in Moscua grassata est" (A Description of Plague that Ravaged Iaşi in 1770 and Moscow in 1771). 
In 1776 Orreus retired from state service and settled in his estate near Saint Petersburg. His experiments with agricultural novelties were publicized in the "Proceeds of the Free Economic Society". He also authored "A Brief Essay on Fever, Diarrhea and Bloody Flux and other Diseases Prevalent among Soldiers", printed in Russian language in Saint Petersburg in 1808.

The Freedom Defence Committee was a UK-based organisation set up in 1945 to "uphold the essential liberty of individuals and organisations, and to defend those who are persecuted for exercising their rights to freedom of speech, writing and action." Chaired by Herbert Read, with George Orwell as vice-chairman, the Committee's secretary was George Woodcock.
The Committee came into being as a result of the Freedom Press being raided at the end of 1944 and four editors of "War Commentary", including Vernon Richards and Philip Sansom, being prosecuted at the beginning of 1945 for attempting "to undermine the affections of members of His Majesty's Forces" and because the National Council for Civil Liberties was considered a Communist front.
An open letter requesting urgent funds was published in the 18 September 1948 issue of "Socialist Leader" and was signed by Benjamin Britten, E. M. Forster, Augustus John, Orwell, Read and Osbert Sitwell. 
It was dissolved in 1949.

Catherine Banfield

Catherine "Cate" Banfield is a fictional character in the American medical drama "ER", portrayed by Angela Bassett. She is an attending physician with a mysterious past with County General. Bassett's addition into the main cast opening credits was in the 2nd episode of season 15.
Life at County and Career.
Banfield was hired in 2008 to become the permanent Chief of the Emergency Department, replacing Dr. Skye Wexler who was serving as acting chief. The board had decided to offer the permanent position to Dr. Gregory Pratt, but with Pratt's death, Banfield was brought in as his replacement. She first appeared in the second episode of Season 15 and immediately puts the whole ER on edge with her tough attitude. It was mentioned that she flew to Indonesia to help that country deal with the 2004 tsunami disaster. On her first day, Nurse Haleh mentioned Banfield looked familiar as if she's been at County before, which Banfield immediately denies. Her first day as Chief tested her skills as an able and efficient leader when a bio-terrorist released a bag of weaponized Ricin in the ER, necessitating an evacuation and quarantine. She briefly met and clashed over a gunshot case with Abby Lockhart, who was finishing her last shift on her last day at County General. Nonetheless, Banfield made amends with her new acquaintance before Abby departed for Boston.
In the episode "Heal Thyself", the treatment of a little girl who almost drowned in the Chicago River triggered painful memories, yet in the end it helped Banfield figure out how to save the girl from a certain death, thereby in her mind redeeming herself from the mistakes she made with her son Darryl.
Later in Season 15, Cate and Archie Morris get snowed in at a conference in Omaha. Banfield ends up getting drunk and makes a wild scene of entertainment in the hotel lobby. She smiles and actually laughs for the first time (probably the first time since before the accident). The two end up having to share a room together before flying back to Chicago. Cate begins to open up more to Morris how they tried to have another baby a few years back but miscarried.
Early life.
In the Season 15 episode "Heal Thyself", the audience begins to learn about Cate Banfield's haunting past and how her experiences have damaged her emotionally. Set in 2002, 6 years earlier, the flashback episode revealed a happier Cate Banfield with her husband Russell (played by Bassett's real life husband, actor Courtney B. Vance) and their 5-year-old son Darryl. Banfield had a more youthful look with longer black hair. She is smiling, which was never seen by the show's audiences until this point. In this episode, she stated to Dr. Greene that she worked as an ER Attending Physician at the University of Southern California. She went to medical school at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
During a day out in the city park, Darryl was struck with a mysterious seizure. Cate at first didn't see it as anything serious and argued against calling 9-1-1, even though her husband Russell insisted. After Darryl began vomiting blood, Cate brought him to County General and was diagnosed by Dr. Mark Greene in Trauma 1. Darryl had acute leukemia, and died from advanced complications that arose with his illness. Cate's initial denial and delay contributed to one of the factors that led to Dr. Greene not being able to save Darryl. This explains how Nurse Haleh had recognized her before and the chilling moment Banfield had on her first day stepping into Trauma 1. In the last scene of the episode, Banfield and Greene talk about what happened near the Chicago River and how the ordeal proved to be completely damaging in Cate's mind and to her relationship with her husband.
Personal life.
In the present day in the episode "Heal Thyself" after Darryl's death, Cate lay in Darryl's empty room, where her husband Russell tells her how he never blamed her for what happened, and Cate cries for the first time over her son's death. Morris is stunned to learn that Cate is working at the hospital where her son died. Later in the season Cate has an appointment with Janet Coburn from O.B. since she and Russell decide they want to try for a baby one last time, even though Coburn tells them the chances are slim. Cate begins to take special injections of hormones to help with her chances in the process and tries to remain hopeful over all the odds, but she and Russell are devastated when the egg implantation process has zero success. Later in the season a mother abandons a baby at County with whom Cate bonds. She convinces Russell that they should adopt the baby. When in the penultimate episode the mother arrives to take her back, Cate convinces her to let her and Russell openly adopt the child.

The "Palestro"-class torpedo boats were large torpedo boats of the Italian "Regia Marina" that saw service from the mid-1920s to World War II.
The ships were designed in 1915 and based on the "Audace"-class destroyer. Eight ships were ordered, but because of wartime shortages of materials only four were eventually completed. These four ships were laid down in 1917 at the Orlando shipyard in Livorno, but were not finally completed until 1921-1923. In 1938 they were re-rated as torpedo boats.
The design was subsequently enlarged into the s, a design that was developed into a series of medium-sized Italian destroyer classes.

Almond Roca

Almond Roca is a brand of chocolate-covered, almond butter crunch, hard toffee with a coating of ground almonds. It is similar to chocolate-covered English toffee. The candy is manufactured by the Brown & Haley Co. of Tacoma, Washington.
Background.
Almond Roca was invented in 1912 by Harry Brown and J. C. Haley, founders of Brown & Haley Company. The candy's name is said to have been inspired by a local librarian, who chose the Spanish word "roca", meaning "rock" in English, to describe the hard, log-shaped confection. Brown & Haley first used Almond Roca's trademark pink tin can containers in 1927 to extend the product's shelf life. Individual pieces of Almond Roca candy are wrapped in gold-colored aluminum foil.
Ingredients.
Almond Roca contains sugar, almonds, butter, palm oil, palm kernel oil, cocoa powder, whey, skim milk powder, soya lecithin, chocolate, and vanilla.
By company tradition, a small amount of the original 1923 batch of toffee is carried over into each subsequent batch of candy.
Empirical studies have shown that the chocolate and almond coating of the candy includes the equivalent of two average sized almonds.
Other varieties.
Since 2003, Brown & Haley has expanded its line of chocolate-coated toffee, with dark chocolate, cashew, macadamia nut, mocha (coffee-flavored), peppermint and sugar-free varieties.

Fibromatosis colli (also known as "Sternomastoid tumor of infancy") is a benign proliferation of fibrous tissue infiltrating the lower third of the sternocleidomastoid, and is the most common cause of neonatal torticollis.
The mass, also known as a hematoma of the sternocleidomastoid, is firm and hard on palpation, but is not tender nor inflammed. 
The mass is easily diagnosed using ultrasound, where it is found within the SCM and enlarges the muscle. The lesion is self-limiting and benign, usually resolving with time and physical therapy. Rarely does it need to be removed surgically.

It is a remake of Balachander's earlier Tamil hit "Avargal" (1977). Jayasudha reprised the role of Sujatha in the original. Kamal Haasan starred in the same role in both languages. This film also had Chiranjeevi as the villainous husband of Jayasudha (Rajinikanth starred as the husband in Tamil). The film was shot in Black and white.
Plot.
The movie revolves around the trials and tribulations of Suhasini (Jayasudha). Suhasini is a happy-go-lucky girl head-over-heels in love with her boyfriend Bharani (Sarath Babu). Her life changes when her father gets transferred to Mumbai (then Bombay). Her love life falls apart as Bharani doesn’t respond to any of her letters. In addition, her father becomes seriously ill. Her father’s office colleague, Subanakar (Chiranjeevi), becomes a great source of strength for her in these tough times. Soon, he asks for her hand in marriage. She accepts gratefully, and confesses that she had a boyfriend, who has seemingly forgotten her.
However, she soon realizes the truth about Subanakar. He is a sadistic and jealous husband, who tortures her no end and, not unsurprisingly, she opts for a divorce. As a divorced woman, with an infant in her hands, she lands in Chennai (then Madras) to take up a new job and start a new life.
Her life takes a turn for the better in Chennai as she has a very supportive friend-group in her office, particularly a widower, Johnny (Kamal Hassan). Johnny, a talented ventriloquist who “talks” through his puppet, Junior. He falls in love with Suhasini, but is unable to muster up the courage to tell her about it.
In an interesting cinematic twist, her ex-husband’s mother discovers her presence in the city and takes up a job as a maid in her house.
Suhasini also stumbles upon Bharani in Chennai and discovers that her letters to him never reached as they were intercepted by his mentally-challenged sister. Soon, Suhasini renews her relationship with Bharani and life seems to be looking up for her. But the ghosts of the past continue to haunt her. Subanakar comes to Chennai in the role of her boss – a contrite and repentant Subanakar, who now wants to re-marry Suhasini and redress the wrongs he had done. The situation becomes piquant with 3 men vying for Suhasini – her ex-love, her ex-husband and a silent lover lurking on the sidelines. Which way will Suhasini go? K. Balachander takes the movie to its logical, yet completely radical and unexpected, end.

American Women's Baseball Federation

American Women's Baseball Federation (AWBF) is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit Amateur Sports Organization formed to organize and promote baseball as a mainstream and lifetime opportunity for women.
The AWBF was founded to help women's baseball teams around the country network through its website and the tournaments it has organized. The AWBF is an assumed name for the American Women's Baseball League.
Since 1992 the AWBF has organized 17 regional and national tournaments. With international partner Women's Baseball Association of Japan (WBAJ) it organized the first four Women's World Series events. National teams met in Canada (2001), United States (2002), Australia (2003) and Japan (2004) to play for international bragging rights. The Women's World Series events were the precursors to the Women's World Cup of Baseball. The Women's World Cup of Baseball started in 2004 in Edmonton and involved most of the same teams that participated in the 2004 Women's World Series. The Women's World Cup of Baseball is now the top elite women's baseball tournament in the world. The Women's World Series is no longer played.
The AWBF now keeps a database of players interested in trying out for the USA Baseball women's national team. Interested players are directed to tryout sites and their names are sent to USA Baseball which holds tryouts and select a women's national team each year.
Jim Glennie is the Founder of the AWBF and served as Director of Player Identification for the USA Baseball Women's National Team.

Distributed mode loudspeaker

Distributed Mode Loudspeaker (DML) is a flat panel loudspeaker technology, developed by NXT, in which sound is produced by inducing uniformly distributed vibration modes in the panel through a special electro-acoustic exciter. Distributed mode loudspeakers function differently from most others, which typically produce sound by inducing pistonic motion in the diaphragm.
Exciters for distributed mode loudspeakers include, but are not limited to, moving coil and piezoelectric devices, and are placed to correspond to the natural resonant model of the panel.
Applications.
NXT licenses two classes of distributed mode loudspeaker: SurfaceSound for traditional flat-panel applications, and SoundVu for applications in which sound is produced directly in front of the display (either through a projection screen which functions as a DML or a transparent DML overlaid on the display). SurfaceSound technology has been incorporated into a number of novel products such as school equipment, portable folding cardboard speakers (SoundpaX, an OEM product manufactured by a number of different companies), and high-end musical greeting cards. Aside from projection screens, SoundVu has been integrated into computer and mobile phone displays.
NXT also licenses the Balanced Mode Radiator (BMR), a hybrid technology that blends DML technology with that of traditional pistonic-action loudspeakers. According to NXT, the resultant speakers feature the low-frequency performance of a traditional loudspeaker, but with a wider directivity and shallower profile, as well as the mid-range and high-frequency performance of a DML. The two types of BMR offered are: the Audio Full Range (AFR), a full-range optimized circular speaker; and the High Aspect Ratio Panel (HARP), a long and thin form factor for use in narrower spaces.
Some DMLs are compatible with traditional amplifiers.
Initial testing by researchers at the Delft University of Technology concluded that DML panels are good potential candidates for use in wave field synthesis applications, as they are light and can be placed close to walls.
Business History.
NXT created intellectual property for surface transducers. HiWave Audio was created in late 2010 as the rebirth of NXT. Tectonic Elements was founded following the acquisition of HiWave Audio by FLAT Audio Technologies.

Helene-Lange-Gymnasium

The Helene-Lange-Gymnasium is a bilingual secondary school in Hamburg, Germany. It was created in 1910 as a girls' school, and has been accessible to boys since 1969. It was the first bilingual school in Hamburg.
It maintains sponsorships with schools in Dar es Salaam, Havana, Chicago, and London.
Building.
The building which today houses the Helene-Lange-Gymnasium was built between 1908-1910 by the architect Albert Erbe, and officially opened on January 4, 1910.
Location.
The school lies in the south-west of the Hamburg quarter Harvestehude on the border to Eimsbüttel.
History.
Early history.
The school has had a long history of renaming. The Hamburg senate gave the school the name "Staatliche höhere Mädchenschule an der Hansastraße" (National girls' higher school on Hansa street). By 1926, the school was renamed from "Lyzeum mit Studienanstalt an der Hansastraße" to "Mädchen-Oberrealschule an der Hansastraße." The change in name from Lyzeum to Oberrealschule created an opportunity to name the school after Helene Lange, a prominent pedagogue and feminist. It was in 1926 that the school was finally given the name "Helene-Lange-Oberrealschule", in small part because only a tenth of the school's periphery was on Hansa street.
Nazi era.
300 Jewish pupils passed through the school between 1910 and 1933. In 1935 — the school's 25th anniversary — the school's name was again renamed to "Hansa-Oberrealschule"; the headmaster had believed the school's inclusive nature ("Völkerversöhnung") was a detriment to German nationality and to the preferment of the Jewish element within the school. On the 25th anniversary, he said the school was imbued with a "new spirit", noting that nearly a fifth of the girls were members of the BDM. There began a decline in Jewish students. By 1939, there were no pupils of the Jewish faith.
The Helene-Lange Gymnasium was one of the first schools in Hamburg to voluntarily remove Jewish students from their student body, without any legal compulsion to do so.
Today.
Today, the school has about 930 students from 46 nations.
Education.
The languages of instruction are German and English. The Helene-Lange-Gymnasium was the first bilingual school in Hamburg as well as one of Germany's first UNESCO project schools.
Since 2003 Helene-Lange-Gymnasium offers the International Baccalaureate additionally to the Hamburg Abitur. The IB students have scored an average of 34 points so far.

Bluewater Michigan Chapter NRHS

The Bluewater Michigan Chapter of the National Railroad Historical Society, colloquially called Bluewater, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which owns a large fleet of historic railway passenger coaches and operates railway excursions and other events/trips involving historical railroads.
History.
Early years.
Bluewater Michigan Chapter was originally intended to exist in the Port Huron, Michigan area and thus named "Bluewater." Shortly after, however, it leased the former SEMTA Rail commuter rail maintenance facility in Pontiac, Michigan, adjacent to the large Grand Trunk Western yards.
Bluewater focused on railway excursions around and beyond the state of Michigan, usually hauled by the host railroad's locomotives. They also loaned their coach fleet out to other excursion operators. An example of a Bluewater excursion would be from Detroit to Fort Wayne, Indiana on July 28 and 29, 1984, where the Norfolk and Western 611 steam locomotive hauled 24 cars including Bluewater coaches. 
Many Bluewater members stored and maintained their privately owned coaches at Bluewater's yard locations. This proved to be a symbiotic relationship, as Bluewater was able to use these coaches in their excursions, allowing passenger trains longer than 20 cars. 
In Owosso, Michigan, Project 1225 had restored the steam locomotive Pere Marquette 1225 and allied with Bluewater to run excursion trains in 1989.
Saginaw relocation.
Bluewater lost the lease to the SEMTA rail facility, and a search for a new location led them to the former Pere Marquette roundhouse/locomotive shops in Saginaw, Michigan which they lease from the Lake State Railway. However, the lease was cancelled in 2009 and the Bluewater shops have moved to another facility in the Saginaw area.
Modern day.
Bluewater operates occasional excursions and trips around Michigan. They also hold a monthly membership meeting in Royal Oak, Michigan.
Fleet.
- Silver Lake - diner
- Haverstraw Bay - baggage-dormitory
- Several coach cars
- Round-end observation.

Porto defeated Braga 1–0, with a goal from the competition's top goalscorer Radamel Falcao, and won their second title in the competition, after victory in the 2002–03 UEFA Cup.
Association team allocation.
A total of 194 teams from 53 UEFA associations participated in the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. Associations were allocated places according to their 2009 UEFA country coefficient, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2004–05 to 2008–09.
Below is the qualification scheme for the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League:
Distribution.
The winners of the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League, Atlético Madrid, were guaranteed a place in the group stage as the title holder, since they did not qualify for the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League. However, they also qualified for the Europa League third qualifying round through domestic performance, as they were the runners-up of the 2009–10 Copa del Rey to Champions League-qualified Sevilla. As a result, this place in the third qualifying round was vacated, which in turn led to the following changes to the default allocation system in order to compensate for this vacant spot:
Redistribution rules.
A Europa League place is vacated when a team qualifies for both the Champions League and the Europa League, or qualifies for the Europa League by more than one method. When a place is vacated, it is redistributed within the national association by the following rules:
Teams.
The labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round:
Round and draw dates.
All draws held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland unless stated otherwise.
Matches in the qualifying, play-off, and knockout rounds may also be played on Tuesdays or Wednesdays instead of the regular Thursdays due to scheduling conflicts.
Seeding.
The draws for the qualifying rounds, the play-off round and the group stage are all seeded based on the 2010 UEFA club coefficients. The coefficients are calculated on the basis of a combination of 20% of the value of the respective national association’s coefficient for the period from 2005–06 to 2009–10 inclusive and the clubs' individual performances in the UEFA club competitions during the same period. Clubs are ordered by their coefficients and then divided into pots as required.
In the draws for the qualifying rounds and the play-off round, the teams are divided evenly into one seeded and one unseeded pot, based on their club coefficients. A seeded team is drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs in each tie also being decided randomly. Due to the limited time between matches, the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds take place before the results of the previous round are known. The seeding in each draw is carried out under the assumption that all of the highest-ranked clubs of the previous round are victorious. If a lower-ranked club is victorious, it simply takes the place of its defeated opponent in the next round. Prior to these draws, UEFA may form "groups" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they are purely for convenience of the draw and do not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition, while ensuring that teams from the same association not drawn against each other.
In the draw for the group stage, the 48 teams are split into four pots of twelve teams, based on their club coefficients, with the title holder (if participating) automatically placed into Pot 1. Each group contains one team from each pot, but teams from the same association cannot be drawn into the same group.
In the draw for the first knockout stage, the twelve group winners and the four better third-placed teams from the Champions League group stage (based on their match record in the group stage) are seeded, and the twelve group runners-up and the other four third-placed teams from the Champions League group stage are unseeded. A seeded team is drawn against an unseeded team, with the seeded team hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association cannot be drawn against each other.
In the draws for the round of 16 onwards, there are no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association may be drawn with each other.
Qualifying rounds.
In the qualifying and play-off rounds, teams play against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis.
The draw for the first two qualifying rounds was made on 21 June 2010, while the draw for the third qualifying round was made on 16 July 2010.
First qualifying round.
The first legs were played on 1 July, and the second legs were played on 8 July 2010.
Second qualifying round.
The first legs were played on 15 July, and the second legs were played on 22 and 23 July 2010.
Third qualifying round.
The first legs were played on 27 and 29 July, and the second legs were played on 3 and 5 August 2010.
Play-off round.
The draw for the play-off round was held on 6 August 2010. The first legs were played on 17 and 19 August, and the second legs were played on 24 and 26 August 2010.
Group stage.
The 48 clubs were drawn into twelve groups of four on 27 August 2010 in Monaco. In each group, teams play against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The matchdays are 16 September, 30 September, 21 October, 4 November, 1–2 December, and 15–16 December 2010. The group winners and runners-up advance to the round of 32, where they are joined by the eight third-placed teams from the group stage of the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League.
If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings (in descending order):
Following a trial at last year's UEFA Europa League, UEFA have announced that in both this year's and the 2011–12 competition, two extra officials would be used – with one on each goal line.
Knockout phase.
In the knockout phase, teams play against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final.
The draw for the round of 32 and round of 16 was held on 17 December 2010. The draws for the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final (to determine the "home" team) were held on 18 March 2011.
Round of 32.
The first legs were played on 15 and 17 February, and the second legs were played on 22, 23 and 24 February 2011.
Round of 16.
The first legs were played on 10 March, and the second legs were played on 17 March 2011.
Quarter-finals.
The first legs were played on 7 April, and the second legs were played on 14 April 2011.
Semi-finals.
The first legs were played on 28 April, and the second legs were played on 5 May 2011.
Final.
The final was played on 18 May 2011 at Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Republic of Ireland. Due to UEFA rules against corporate sponsorship outside the federation, for the final the stadium was referred to as the "Dublin Arena".

Dowell had lost to Tillman in 2003.In the City Council, Alderman Dowell is a member of the Housing and Real Estate, Transportation and the Public Way, Landmarks, Rules and Health Committees.
Ms. Dowell has a B.A. degree in Developmental Psychology from the University of Rochester and a Masters Degree in Social Service Administration from the University of Chicago.Alderman Dowell introduced the amendment to the Vacant Property Ordinance that was passed by the Chicago City Council on July 28, 2011, holding banks responsible for maintaining foreclosed properties in neighborhoods across Chicago. Dowell commented on the issue, saying:
“The foreclosure process sometimes takes a year or 18 months, two years for them to actually foreclose on the property and sometimes certain banks let those properties sit vacant...They can become haven for gang bangers and drug dealers; there is also the potential for fire hazards...When vacant buildings are left to deteriorate, local property values tumble and criminality gains an entry into the neighborhood...The landmark piece of legislation passed today will hold banks responsible for the upkeep of vacant properties, keeping them secure and keeping neighborhoods intact.” Dowell also stated that: "This legislation goes a long way to keep our neighborhoods vibrant and soften the negative impact the housing foreclosure process has had on the city".
Alderman Dowell was the recipient of the Independent Voters of Illinois' Best Aldermanic Voting Record for 2010, presented by the Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization (IVI-IPO), a not-for-profit, multi-partisan, independent political organization that has been in existence since 1944 dedicated to good government activism. Alderman Dowell along with Alderman Bob Fioretti (2nd) and Alderman Joe Moore (49th), was given IVI-IPO's Best Aldermanic Voting Award. Upon receiving the award Alderman Dowell stated: "I am thankful for the IVI-IPO recognition of my work in the City Council and my commitment to good government and participatory democracy. These are values I hold most dear and I'm proud to be associated with an organization like IVO-IPO that has been fighting the fight for social justice for over 60 years".

Rohan Sabharwal

Rohan Sabharwal (born Rohan Ajay Sabharwal on 10 October 1979) is an Indian filmmaker.
Family life and education.
Sabharwal was born in the city of Mumbai. He is the elder of two sons born to a Punjabi father and a Catholic mother of mixed Goan-Portuguese and Anglo-Irish descent. He finished his schooling at the Lawrence School, Lovedale in 1996. He is a graduate of the London Film School, London, UK under the guidance of Oscar-nominated Mike Leigh O.B.E.
He is the great grandson and grandson of freedom fighters Laxmi Devi Sharma and Som Kumari Sabharwal and great grandson of Sardar Bahadur Ram Singh Sabharwal, Secretary Military Finance in the British Indian Government. His paternal uncles Vineet Kumar and Sudhir Kumar are both former hockey Olympians. His paternal ancestors were a well known Khukhrain family/clan of Peshawar ( now in Pakistan ). His Great Great Grandfather, Rai Bahadur Kanshi Ram Anand,started the first ever Girls High School in Peshawar sometime in the early 20th century.
His mother, Carmen ( Rozario ) Sabharwal, is a designer in Mumbai.
Film career.
After graduating from film school in 2006, the same year that he edited the award winning commercial 'Sarah and Wendy' which won the Kodak Student Commercial Award in the UK, he left London to pursue a career in film and television in India. Here he shot his 16-minute graduation film "Shunyata", which premiered at the ICA cinema in London and generated mixed reviews, though most were favorable. He has been criticized for his views on censorship, especially that in "Shunyata", his showing of an amputated leg was unnecessary and served as an attempt to disturb the audience rather than illustrate the film's point. He denies this and says the shot was not in bad taste and was absolutely necessary to illustrate the horrors of unnecessary communal disharmony. He has also refuted claims that the film is anti-Hindu.
He became widely recognized as a filmmaker after the Celebrate Bandra Committee picked his 25-minute short "Romson and Juliana" to show at their biennial festival Celebrate Bandra in 2007. 
His most recent film is the first episode of a television documentary series called "India Rediscovered", inspired by Jawaharlal Nehru's book "The Discovery of India". The series proposes to cover places of historic importance in India that have been ignored by text books.
Future projects.
Sabharwal has begun working on his comedy feature, "There Are No Americans in Taxis", that tells four stories that happen on a day when all cellular networks in Mumbai fail and a whole city is rendered helpless. He is also in the process of producing a feature documentary on the Jewish community in India.

American Society for Clinical Investigation

The American Society for Clinical Investigation (ASCI), established in 1908, is one of the oldest and most respected medical honor societies in the United States.
Organization and purpose.
The ASCI is an honorary society to which more than 2,800 physician-scientists from all medical specialties belong. Prospective members are proposed by standing members of the society and elected to ASCI on the basis of an outstanding record of scholarly achievement in biomedical research. The ASCI includes physician-scientists who are active clinically, in basic research, or in teaching. Many of its senior members are widely recognized leaders in academic medicine. At present, the membership of ASCI includes 303 members of the Institute of Medicine, 155 members of the United States National Academy of Sciences, 29 Lasker Award winners and 16 Nobel laureates.
The ASCI supports the research into basic mechanisms and/or treatment of human diseases, and to the education of future generations of physician-scientists. The ASCI considers the nominations of several hundred physician-scientists from the United States and abroad each year and elects up to 80 new members each year for their significant research accomplishments relatively early in their careers.
The ASCI is a member of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), which includes numerous biomedical research societies. The ASCI publishes the "Journal of Clinical Investigation", a peer-reviewed biomedical research journal.
A collection of the society's papers are held at the National Library of Medicine.
History.
The American Society for Clinical Investigation has its origins in a chance meeting in June 1907 on the Boardwalk in Atlantic City, in which Drs. Samuel J. Meltzer, David L. Edsall, Wilder Tileston, Warfield Loncope, and probably Joseph H. Pratt were present. The parties to this meeting considered the need for a new society, separate from the Association of American Physicians (AAP), whose membership was at that time limited to 160 individuals. The purpose of the new society would be to give younger men who were not yet members of the AAP, and not eligible for membership in the AAP, the advantages of meeting other young men active in medical research. The new organization was formally constituted on May 11, 1908, at the New Willard Hotel in Washington. A total of 32 physicians agreed to become charter members of ASCI in 1908. The first meeting of the ASCI was held in Atlantic City on May 10, 1909. The organization was also known as the "Young Turks" in allusion to the rebellious spirit in which it was founded, as a counterweight to the older and more deeply established Association of American Physicians (colloquially known as the "Old Turks" in subsequent years).
