RAF Melbourne

RAF Melbourne was a Royal Air Force station during the Second World War. Located 5 miles to the South-west of Pocklington, Yorkshire, England. The nearest village is Seaton Ross.
History.
East Common just outside the village of Seaton Ross was requisitioned for use as a grass airfield in November 1940. In late 1940 the airfield was used by Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys of 10 Squadron as a relief landing ground for RAF Leeming. The airfield soon closed for re-development as a standard Bomber Command airfield with three concrete runways and three hangars.
The first user of the re-built airfield was again 10 Squadron but by this time operating the Handley Page Halifax four-engined heavy bomber, little time was wasted before the aircraft were used on operational sorties from Melbourne. The squadron continued with operation until March 1945 and lost 109 aircraft on operations.
Melbourne was unusually equipped with FIDO fog dispersant system. This made the airfield popular diversion airfield for other squadrons returning from operations to Yorkshire. 
In May 1945 the airfield was transferred to RAF Transport Command and 575 Squadron moved in with the Douglas Dakota. The squadron only stayed for a few months operating transport flight to and from continental Europe. With the departure of the Dakota a number of specialised Flights used the airfield for six months but by the middle of 1946 the airfield was no longer used for flying.
Current use.
The airfield is now home to York Raceway running drag racing throughout the summer. The farm on the North Eastern side of the site still uses the main East/West runway for his single prop aeroplane.

Vejle Fjord

Vejle Fjord is a fjord in Denmark. It is approximately 22 km (13.7 mi) in length, and stretches east from the town of Vejle at the head to the towns of Trelde Næs on the south side and Juelsminde on the north side at the mouth. The fjord's generally calm surface waters are surrounded by low forested hills shaped by glaciers during the last ice age.
Public works projects have re-shaped the small rivers and countryside surrounding the fjord since the Middle Ages.
Highway E45 crosses the fjord just east of the town of Vejle on the Vejle Fjord Bridge.

Ajmal Masroor

Ajmal Masroor (; born 19 October 1971) is a Bangladeshi-born British Imam, broadcaster and politician. He is well known for being a television presenter on political discussions and on Muslim channels.
Early life.
Masroor was born in Bangladesh and came to Britain at the age of one when his parents immigrated from the country. He moved back to Bangladesh a few years later at the age of nine due to his father’s concerns about different cultures and the possibility of losing their Muslim identities. However, they returned when he was at the age of 13.
When living in the East End, Masroor experienced racism against the Bangladeshis in the areas, with properties being damaged. He was brought up in Shadwell, and attended the Bluegate Fields School on Cable Street. He is the oldest of six children. At the age of 19, his father attempted to force him into a marriage in Bangladesh, but was unsuccessful because Masroor challenged his father, saying forced marriage is not acceptable in Islam. He then married a Hungarian, Henrietta Szovati (who had converted to Islam), and they now have two children.
After his GCSEs and A Levels, he was very active in student unions and Islamic Societies.
Career.
Masroor is a local imam, who leads Friday prayers weekly at four different mosques in London: Goodge Street mosque, Palmers Green mosque, West Ealing mosque and Wightman Road mosque in Haringey. 
Masroor is currently a Member of the Muslim Council of Britain, the Central Working Committee Spokesperson for the Islamic Society of Britain (and a member of its national consultative body) he is the chairman and director of Communities in Action. 
He stood in the 2010 General Election, for the Bethnal Green and Bow constituency in East London, representing the Liberal Democrats, and came second place to Rushanara Ali. He was selected as Lib Dem PPC for West Ham during 2005, but stood down after being criticised for posting on the Muslim Public Affairs Committee forum.
Masroor is a well known television presenter on various TV channels in the UK. He currently presents his own programmes on Islam Channel and on Channel S, where he presents an English programme called "Let's Talk". He is also part of the panel in a programme broadcast by Channel 4, called "Shariah TV". On Channel 4, he also presented a programme called "Make Me a Muslim" - he asks six non-Muslims and one lapsed Muslim to follow Islamic teachings for three weeks. In 10 May 2009, Masroor presented a programme called "Celebrity Lives - Sharia Style" which was broadcast on BBC One.
He has also appeared on major news channels such as the BBC, CNN and many other channels as a commentator on social, political and religious issues. On 30 January 2011, he appeared on the BBC show The Big Questions.
In October 2013 Masroor was alerted by anti-terrorist police that he and a number of other prominent Muslim figures in the UK who had spoken out against Islamist extremism were targeted by a propaganda video created by Al-Shabaab, the terrorist group responsible for the attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya: the video urged jihadists in the UK to take action, citing the murder of Lee Rigby as an example to follow. Interviewed by "Al Jazeera", Masroor said of the video: "It is a terrible piece of work and the content is vile and disgusting and horrific in many ways. It is a group of people who are glorifying violence and death. It didn't make me scared. It just made me angry and more determined."
Personal life.
Masroor currently lives in Haringey, London. His interests include learning about new cultures and world food, playing badminton, and reading based on history, society and politics.

Darlamdanda

Darlamdanda is a village development committee in Palpa District in the Lumbini Zone of southern Nepal. At the time of the 1991 Nepal census it had a population of 2389 people living in 469 individual households.
This VDC shares its borders with Khanichhap VDC in the east, Nayar Namtalesh and Chappani VDCs in the south, Yamgha VDC in the west, and Syangja district on the north. The holy place Ramdi on the bank of Kali Gandaki river is located in this VDC. The famous and unique Ramdi-pul (bridge) in the Palpa Syangja section of Siddarath Highway is located here. There are special occasions like haribodhani ekadashi (also called Kattike Thuliekadashi), baishakhe sakranti (Nepali new year) that people from neighbouring VDCs and districts visit here.
Darlamdanda Higher Secondary School is one of the major educational institutions in the area. It was established in 2013 BS (Bikram Sambat) as a primary school. It has been upgraded to higher levels in different steps and now classes run up to 12th grade. This school has a huge impact on the educational life of the people in the remote north of the district headquarter.
The climate in the area is very nice all yeararound. The snowfall is a rare case almost no record so far. It rains heavily in the summer. There is no irrigation facility so farmers have to depend on the rain (monsoon). The climate is very friendly to grow variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains.
This place was also known for the Sani Ukali (short but steeper climbings) on the way from Ramdi to Tansen and the Thuli Ukali (big one) in the neighbouring Chappani VDC. There was a project,around 1991 AD (2047 BS) to improve this historical trekking road from Ramdi to Tansen and some section of this was upgraded nicely. However, the work was not completed. After few years, another project started to provide a roadway from Tansen to Ramdi. This included a very hard work of the local people. By 2008 AD (2065 BS) the first phase of it was completed. Except for heavily raining seasons, there is a transportation service available from Butwal and Tansen to Darlamdanda and neighbouring village development committees.
In Nepali, the name of this place is दर्लमडांडा (and not the दर्लामडांडा as it sounds so from the spelling DARLAMDANDA). The ward number one of Darlamdanda VDC also has the same name Darlamdanda. There is a tale\story why the name is darlamdanda, many years ago there were people living with their last name Darlami and geographically the place is a hill/mountain (with meaning डांडा in Nepali language). With this combination the place is now known as दर्लमडांडा. However, majority of the people living in Darlamdanda today have a very different last name (Gaire) compared to the historic last name (Darlami).
The population of the Darlamdanda VDC is very diverse. This obviously has impact on the social, cultural, educational, and economical life of the people living there.

Emanuel Cleaver II Boulevard

Emanuel Cleaver II Boulevard, Cleaver 2, or 47th Street and Brush Creek Boulevard is a major west/east main street that runs in Kansas City, Missouri from J.C. Nichols Parkway to 31st Street. It travels close to Brush Creek. The street is named after Emanuel Cleaver. Because several streets were renamed in honor of the former mayor, there is considerable confusion concerning addresses and location along Emanuel Cleaver II Boulevard. Brush Creek Boulevard formerly ran from Main Street to Elmwood Avenue, at which point it became Van Brunt Boulevard. This is the current route of Cleaver II Blvd, which continues north onto the former southern end of Van Brunt Boulevard. However, in order to preserve the name of the historic Brush Creek Boulevard, a three block length of 46th Street, from Gilham Road to The Paseo, was renamed Brush Creek Boulevard. Because of this, addresses in old directories and maps are not congruent with the current ones. An example is the Spirit of Freedom Fountain, currently given by the City of Kansas City, Missouri as at Cleveland Avenue and Brush Creek Boulevard. The new Brush Creek Boulevard does not extend to Cleveland Avenue. The name Brush Creek Boulevard is still used colloquially by long-term and older residents.

However, though England did retain the title it was only on points difference, the loss of key players to the World Cup Sevens was, perhaps, significant in making this an extraordinary championship full of remarkable results...

Club colours were chosen to reflect the now defunct local Keilor Park Primary School (1971–2008). This consisted of green with an orange strip and green socks. Its emblem was a Devil with a pitchfork. As history has it, the green and orange colours were adopted by the primary school in 1971 to reflect two distinct team 'houses' for students. Bulai-Bulai was the green colour and Wurra-Nunna was designated the orange.

Goode-Hall House

The Goode-Hall House, also commonly known as Saunders Hall, is a historic plantation house in the Tennessee River Valley near Town Creek, Alabama. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 1, 1974, due to its architectural significance.
History.
The house was built in 1830 by Turner Saunders, a Methodist minister and planter originally from Brunswick County, Virginia. After living in the house for a little more than a decade, Saunders sold it in 1844 to Freeman Goode. The house was later acquired by the Hall family and then, in the 1940s, it passed into the care of the Mauldin family when they purchased the farm property that the house sits on. It remains in the Mauldin family today, although they have never resided there because of its remote nature.
Architecture.
The house is built in a provincial interpretation of a Palladian three-part plan, possibly influenced by the Jeffersonian architecture of Saunders' native Virginia. The cramped proximity of the three front triangular pediments betray the vernacular nature of the composition, although the remainder is well-proportioned.
The entire house is constructed in brick above a raised basement. The two-story main block features a Tuscan portico with an arched lunette in the pediment, this feature was a common Jeffersonian architectural device. The main block is flanked to either side by one-story wings with front and side gables, their front pediments also have lunettes. The front walls of the wings feature brick pilasters with simple capitals. The front door is noteworthy in that it features two engaged Tuscan columns supporting a molded cornice.
The Goode-Hall House was not the only large plantation house built in the area by the Saunders family. Turner Saunder's son, James, built a large Italianate house at Rocky Hill Castle.

Octavia Nasr

Octavia Nasr () is a journalist who covers Middle East affairs. She served as CNN’s Senior Editor of Mideast affairs until her dismissal in July 2010 over her public statement of respect on Twitter for the Lebanese cleric Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, whom she considered "one of Hezbollah's giants I respect a lot." She currently cohosts the MBC program "Kalam Nawaem".
Career.
Octavia Nasr has worked in the news business 25 years. Born and raised a Christian in war-torn Lebanon, she saw first-hand how conflict and diverse traditions affected the Middle East. That experience, and her own spirit of innovation and curiosity, led her to found Bridges Media Consulting, through which she writes, provides commentary and lectures on myriad issues dealing with political and cultural issues of the Middle East.
Nasr’s deft adaption to social media and new technology make her one of few journalists equally comfortable news using traditional news gathering and reporting techniques or social media. She showcased these talents in her prior role at CNN, leading the integration of social media and international news gathering. 
For more than 20 years, Nasr covered every major story involving the Middle East, as an on-air and off-air expert across CNN’s global platforms. Her tenure at the network started just after Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait. She coordinated network coverage of the Gulf War as part of CNN’s international assignment desk. In 2001, Nasr’s distinct experience and wide-ranging knowledge of Middle East cultures brought her broad recognition during CNN’s coverage of the September 11th attacks and their aftermath. She spent months traveling in the Middle East, coordinating on-air appearances and nurturing relationships with media partners that resulted in exclusive news gathering deals.
Fadlallah comments and CNN dismissal.
Following the death of Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah on July 4, 2010, Nasr tweeted on the same day that she was "Sad to hear of the passing of Sayyed Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah.. One of Hezbollah's giants I respect a lot..."
Nasr was criticized for this perceived show of sympathy and support for Hezbollah amid claims that her stated position was incompatible with her role at CNN as editor of news on the Middle East.
Nasr concluded her statement by saying that Fadlallah was "revered across borders yet designated a terrorist. Not the kind of life to be commenting about in a brief tweet. It's something I deeply regret." A CNN spokesman responded saying that "CNN regrets any offense her Twitter message caused. It did not meet CNN’s editorial standards." The following day, on July 7, CNN fired Nasr. In an internal CNN memo announcing Nasr's departure, CNN International’s senior vice president for newsgathering, Parisa Khosravi, wrote, "We believe that her credibility in her position as senior editor for Middle Eastern affairs has been compromised going forward."
In response to reactions to her comment, Nasr wrote on July 6 an explanation of what she meant with her tweet.
Reaction.
Articles and commentaries following Nasr's sacking have been divided. Thomas Friedman was also among the many who were troubled by the decision, saying that the decision undermined the network's credibility and sent the wrong signal to young people entering journalism. He wrote "I find Nasr's firing troubling." He questioned CNN's reaction by asking, "To begin with, what has gotten into us? One misplaced verb now and within hours you can have a digital lynch mob chasing after you—and your bosses scrambling for cover". In response, Mediaite's Dan Abrams asked "Can you imagine what would happen to a U.S. journalist expressing admiration for an Al Qaeda leader who had other, better, attributes?" Glen Greenwald in Salon.com wrote, "That message spawned an intense fit of protest from Far Right outlets, Thought Crime enforcers, and other neocon precincts, and CNN quickly (and characteristically) capitulated to that pressure by firing her." Greenwald referred to Fadlallah as "one of the Shiite world's most beloved religious figures", highlighting how the world viewed him including many in the west as shown in the "Time" Magazine's choice of Man of the year 2010 Fond Farewell. Others expressed concern over what they viewed as similar incidents, most notably Hearst syndicated columnist Helen Thomas retiring under criticism one month earlier.
Those who agreed with CNN's decision stated that it had a right to enforce standards of objectivity in its reporting. Those who supported Nasr felt her firing constituted a new trend in the political climate for journalists and journalism covering politically sensitive issues in general, and the Middle East in particular.
Orthodox rabbi Shmuley Boteach wrote "For people like...Nasr..., an imam like Fadlallah who wants to kill Americans and Israelis but who is unexpectedly nice to women has taken a giant leap forward from the Dark Ages, deserving respect and praise. This attitude is, of course, not only deeply amoral and patronizing nonsense but historically false."
"Huffington Post" article with title "CNN's Octavia Nasr: Another Victim of America's Thought Police" writes: "Since 9/11 America's redline has conflated terrorism and Israel's security, flattening all difference and particularity. As Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer pointed out, this has dangerous consequences for both the implementation of policy and the policing of public thought (they were called anti-Semites for this)." While "The Guardian" writes: "Nasr is one of the more high-profile victims of a phenomenon known as "twittercide", comparing the incident with another controversy surrounding death of Fadlallah, namely a tribute to him which came from the UK ambassador to Beriut.
Expressing a contrary opinion, Robert Fisk derided CNN and its credibility over the firing, saying "Poor old CNN goes on getting more cowardly by the hour. That's why no one cares about it any more."

<doc id="20670019" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20670019" title="Scanning SQUID microscopy">
Scanning SQUID microscopy

Scanning SQUID microscopy is a technique where a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) is used to image surface magnetic field strength with micrometre scale resolution. A tiny SQUID is mounted onto a tip which is then rastered near the surface of the sample to be measured. As the SQUID is the most sensitive detector of magnetic fields available and can be constructed at submicrometre widths via lithography, the scanning SQUID microscope allows magnetic fields to be measured with unparalleled resolution and sensitivity. The first scanning SQUID microscope was built in 1992 by Black "et al.". Since then the technique has been used to confirm unconventional superconductity in several high-temperature superconductors including YBCO and BSCCO compounds.
Operating Principles.
The Scanning SQUID microscope is based upon the thin-film DC SQUID. A DC SQUID consists of superconducting electrodes in a ring pattern connected by two weak-link Josephson junctions (see figure). Above the critical current of the Josephson junctions, the idealized difference in voltage between the electrodes is given by
where "R" is the resistance between the electrodes, "I" is the current, "I"0 is the maximum supercurrent, "Ic" is the critical current of the Josephson junctions, Φ is the total magnetic flux through the ring, and Φ0 is the magnetic flux quantum.
Hence, a DC SQUID can be used as a flux-to-voltage transducer. However, as noted by the figure, the voltage across the electrodes oscillates sinusoidally with respect to the amount of magnetic flux passing through the device. As a result, alone a SQUID can only be used to measure the change in magnetic field from some known value, unless the magnetic field or device size is very small such that Φ < Φ0. To use the DC SQUID to measure standard magnetic fields, one must either count the number of oscillations in the voltage as the field is changed, which is very difficult in practice, or use a separate DC bias magnetic field parallel to the device to maintain a constant voltage and consequently constant magnetic flux through the loop. The strength of the field being measured will then be equal to the strength of the bias magnetic field passing through the SQUID.
Although it is possible to read the DC voltage between the two terminals of the SQUID directly, because noise tends to be a problem in DC measurements, an alternating current technique is used. In addition to the DC bias magnetic field, an AC magnetic field of constant amplitude, with field strength generating Φ « Φ0, is also emitted in the bias coil. This AC field produces an AC voltage with amplitude proportional to the DC component in the SQUID. The advantage of this technique is that the frequency of the voltage signal can be chosen to be far away from that of any potential noise sources. By using a lock-in amplifier the device can read only the frequency corresponding to the magnetic field, ignoring many other sources of noise.
Instrumentation.
As the SQUID material must be superconducting, measurements must be performed at low temperatures. Typically, experiments are carried out below liquid helium temperature (4.2 K) in a helium-3 refrigerator or dilution refrigerator. However, advances in high-temperature superconductor thin-film growth have allowed relatively inexpensive liquid nitrogen cooling to instead be used. It is even possible to measure room-temperature samples by only cooling a high "Tc" squid and maintaining thermal separation with the sample. In either case, due to the extreme sensitivity of the SQUID probe to stray magnetic fields, in general some form of magnetic shielding is used. Most common is a shield made of mu-metal, possibly in combination with a superconducting "can" (all superconductors repel magnetic fields via the Meissner effect).
The actual SQUID probe is generally made via thin-film deposition with the SQUID area outlined via lithography. A wide variety of superconducting materials can be used, but the two most common are Niobium, due to its relatively good resistance to damage from thermal cycling, and YBCO, for its high "Tc" > 77 K and relative ease of deposition compared to other high "Tc" superconductors. In either case, a superconductor with critical temperature higher than that of the operating temperature should be chosen. The SQUID itself can be used as the pickup coil for measuring the magnetic field, in which case the resolution of the device is proportional to the size of the SQUID. However, currents in or near the SQUID generate magnetic fields which are then registered in the coil and can be a source of noise. To reduce this effect it is also possible to make the size of the SQUID itself very small, but attach the device to a larger external superconducting loop located far from the SQUID. The flux through the loop will then be detected and measured, inducing a voltage in the SQUID.
The resolution and sensitivity of the device are both proportional to the size of the SQUID. A smaller device will have greater resolution but less sensitivity. The change in voltage induced is proportional to the inductance of the device, and limitations in the control of the bias magnetic field as well as electronics issues prevent a perfectly constant voltage from being maintained at all times. However, in practice, the sensitivity in most scanning SQUID microscopes is sufficient for almost any SQUID size for many applications, and therefore the tendency is to make the SQUID as small as possible to enhance resolution. Via e-beam lithography techniques it is possible to fabricate devices with total area of 1–10 μm2, although devices in the tens to hundreds of square micrometres are more common.
The SQUID itself is mounted onto a cantilever and operated either in direct contact with or just above the sample surface. The position of the SQUID is usually controlled by some form of electric stepping motor. Depending on the particular application, different levels of precision may be required in the height of the apparatus. Operating at lower-tip sample distances increases the sensitivity and resolution of the device, but requires more advanced mechanisms in controlling the height of the probe. In addition such devices require extensive vibration dampening if precise height control is to be maintained.
Operation.
Operation of a scanning SQUID microscope consists of simply cooling down the probe and sample, and rastering the tip across the area where measurements are desired. As the change in voltage corresponding to the measured magnetic field is quite rapid, the strength of the bias magnetic field is typically controlled by feedback electronics. This field strength is then recorded by a computer system that also keeps track of the position of the probe. An optical camera can also be used to track the position of the SQUID with respect to the sample.
Applications.
The Scanning SQUID microscope was originally developed for an experiment to test the pairing symmetry of the high-temperature cuprate superconductor YBCO. Standard superconductors are isotropic with respect to their superconducting properties, that is, for any direction of electron momentum k in the superconductor, the magnitude of the order parameter and consequently the superconducting energy gap will be the same. However, in the high-temperature cuprate superconductors, the order parameter instead follows the equation
Δ(k) = Δ0(cos("kxa")-cos("kya")), meaning that when crossing over any of the directions in momentum space one will observe a sign change in the order parameter. The form of this function is equal to that of the "l" = 2 spherical harmonic function, giving it the name d-wave superconductivity. As the superconducting electrons are described by a single coherent wavefunction, proportional to exp(-"i"φ), where φ is known as the phase of the wavefunction, this property can be also interpreted as a phase shift of π under a 90 degree rotation.
This property was exploited by Tsuei "et al.". by manufacturing a series of YBCO ring Josephson junctions which crossed Bragg planes of a single YBCO crystal (figure). In a Josephson junction ring the superconducting electrons form a coherent wave function, just as in a superconductor. As the wavefunction must have only one value at each point, the overall phase factor obtained after traversing the entire Josephson circuit must be an integer multiple of 2π, as otherwise, one would obtain a different value of the probability density depending on the number of times one traversed the ring.
In YBCO, upon crossing the planes in momentum (and real) space, the wavefunction will undergo a phase shift of π. Hence if one forms a Josephson ring device where this plane is crossed (2"n"+1), number of times, a phase difference of (2"n"+1)π will be observed between the two junctions. For 2"n", or even number of crossings, as in B, C, and D, a phase difference of (2"n")π will be observed. Compared to the case of standard s-wave junctions, where no phase shift is observed, no anomalous effects were expected in the B,C, and D cases, as the single valued property is conserved, but for device A, the system must do something to for the φ=2"n"π condition to be maintained. In the same property behind the scanning SQUID microscope, the phase of the wavefunction is also altered by the amount of magnetic flux passing through the junction, following the relationship Δφ=π(Φ0). As was predicted by Sigrist and Rice, the phase condition can then be maintained in the junction by a spontaneous flux in the junction of value Φ0/2.
Tsuei "et al.". used a scanning SQUID microscope to measure the local magnetic field at each of the devices in the figure, and observed a field in ring A approximately equal in magnitude Φ0/2"A", where "A" was the area of the ring. The device observed zero field at B, C, and D. The results provided one of the earliest and most direct experimental confirmations of d-wave pairing in YBCO.

Steven Toushin

Steven Toushin (born August 6, 1946 in Brooklyn, NY) is an American producer and distributor of gay pornographic and BDSM films who has operated adult theaters and sex clubs since 1970. Toushin owns and manages the Bijou Theater in Chicago, the oldest gay adult theater and sex club in the United States and www.bijouworld.com. Toushin has produced multiple underground and classic pornographic films and published several books on the matter. He has been a defendant in the United States justice system continuously from 1969 until the present; he has defended himself and his companies in twenty-one obscenity cases including two federal obscenity trials; and has suffered thirty-five personal arrests and over 200 busts to his businesses.
Career.
Steven Toushin was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. He left New York in 1963 at the age of 18, on his bicycle and traveled to Montreal to see Marlene Dietrich at Expo. During the next two years he traveled and worked at odd jobs digging graves, short order cook, picking potatoes, cutting pulp wood throughout New England. Steven left New England in the summer of 1968 landing in Chicago, where he got a job managing the Aardvark Theater in Pipers Alley that showed 16mm underground experimental art and documentary films. This was the beginning of his unusual career.
The Aardvark's screening policy was not a successful endeavor and to sustain itself turned to screening art films that displayed nudity from time to time to turn a profit. In 1970 Toushin and partners presented at the Aardvark the first hardcore film to be released commercially in the U.S, Alex DeRenzy's "Pornography in Denmark" at that point the Aardvark became a porn theater. Later that year Toushin and his partners opened other theaters and sex clubs throughout Chicago, San Francisco, Indianapolis, East Chicago and Gary, Indiana, including the Festival Chicago, Festival Indianapolis, Termite, 3-Penny, Eden, Savages, and Bijou Theaters. Of these only the Bijou remains open.
Toushin's first arrest for obscenity occurred in 1969 for screening the underground classic film Flaming Creatures by Jack Smith. Obscenity charges were brought under Illinois state law. In 1970 similar charges were brought for screening I Am Curious (Yellow) in Indianapolis, in 1973 for Deep Throat and in 1974 for "Teenage Fantasies". The case resulting from the 1974 arrest was dismissed after a two week jury trial: Toushin also defended himself in two federal obscenity suits regarding BDSM . His first federal obscenity trial occurred in 1973 for screening "Ranch Slaves". His last obscenity bust was in 1991 for the Film "More of a Man".
In 1987, several of his Slave and Master films were indicted on Federal obscenity charges in Tennessee, Utah and Nebraska as a result of
Attorney General Meese's Commission on Pornography. This resulted in an extraordinary SM trial that included many well-known people from the Leather community. Steven’s book, The Destruction of the Moral Fabric of America, is centered on this trial. The last police raid on his business was in 1996 and his last federal trial (second trial for tax's stemming from 1980–1982) was in 1998.
Toushin has flourished longer than anyone else in the adult industry despite 35 arrests (personally), and 200 busts to his business's that included 21 obscenity trials, five federal trials, three federal appeals (winning two) and numerous state and local trials. Toushin has been incarcerated twice (1988 and 1996) spending three years in federal prison for being in his chosen profession.
Toushin is still the owner of the Bijou Theater (1970) the oldest gay theatre/sex club in the U.S., and Bijou Video a gay adult mail order company (1978). Over all his businesses have included theaters, sex clubs, gay bathhouses, massage parlors (prostitution), and adult bookstores in Chicago, San Francisco, Indianapolis, and East Chicago. Toushin made and produced both gay and straight adult films from 1971 to 1996 as well as S/M films in the 1970s and Slave & Master films in the early 1980s. With the advent of video Toushin became a major distributor of gay pornographic and S/M films until 1995. Toushin published "The Bijou Video Catalog" which many called the bible of gay video from 1980 to 1995.
In 1987 he made a censorship commercial that was put on 70% of all sex tapes till 1993. He has written for several weekly gay magazines, and has authored four books, The Puppy Papers, Puppy’s Tales, The Destruction of the Moral Fabric of America, and the Bijou Cock Coloring Book.
In 1989 at the Adult Video Awards show in Las Vegas Toushin received (while he was in prison) the Reuben Sturman Award “For Legal Battles on Behalf of the Adult Industry. In 2007 at the GayVN award show in San Francisco, Toushin was awarded the “Life Time Achievement Award” from the Gay Adult Industry. He is the 3rd person to ever receive this honor. In the June 2008 AVN (Adult Video News) magazine’s 25th anniversary edition Toushin was acknowledged as one of the 25 pioneers who developed the Gay/bi Adult Film Industry. In January 2009 at the AVN award show in Las Vegas Toushin was inducted into the prestigious Founders Branch. This award recognized Toushin’s (starting in 1969) contribution as a major player in developing the modern Adult Industry.
In Dec 2007 Mr. Toushin was elected to the board of the Free Speech Coalition an organization that represents the Adult Industry. In January 2009 Mr. Toushin holds the distinction of being the first person to be voted off the Board of the FSC. Toushin felt the FSC did not represent the needs and interests of the current Adult Industry. So he created an outline for establishing an organization for business owners and sent out the proposal to select members of the Adult Industry. His proposal included a code of ethics, mission, vision and philosophy for establishing an organization that would best represent the interests of the modern adult industry in the U.S.. This did not sit well with the FSC.
1989 Federal obscenity trial.
Toushin's second federal obscenity suit began in July 1988 when grand juries in Tennessee and Utah indicted him for the distribution of "Erotic Hands", "The Final Chapter of Mistress Ann", "You Said a Mouthful", and "Please Sir", films that depict extremely brutal and degrading S/M scenes. Nonetheless, Toushin argued that his BDSM films were not legally obscene. At the time of indictment, the U.S. government was conducting a third investigation in Nebraska and an indictment there followed. All three investigations were the product of a federal program named “Operation PostPorn” which comprised a nationwide federal investigation spanning 9 U.S. cities and led to the indictment of 20 people and 14 corporations including Toushin and his companies.
The U.S. Government sought indictments for "obscenity by the standards of a local community" by ordering U.S. Postal Inspectors in Tennessee, Utah, and Nebraska to order catalogs and magazines from Toushin's businesses located in Chicago, IL. Tennessee District Judge John T. Nixon stated that “there is no established evidence that the films involved in this case have ever been sent to the jurisdiction by defendants except for those copies ordered by the Government.” Toushin asked the Tennessee court to transfer his case to Northern Illinois but Judge Nixon refused, stating that the appropriate finder of fact is a jury selected from the community in which the offense took place and that such a transfer should only be granted when there is “intentional overreaching” by the government. Nixon found that “although the Government took measures inducing the defendants to mail allegedly obscene materials to Middle Tennessee, the defendants made a deliberate decision to conduct business here mailing the materials.” ("see" Miller test)
Toushin defended himself from federal obscenity charges by arguing that his films were “predominately violent” and did not appeal to a prurient, sick, shameful, morbid or unhealthy interest in sex. He brought expert witnesses to testify that average members of the BDSM community would not have a prurient interest in these films. The experts were psychotherapist Guy Baldwin, Dr. Robert Stoller, Dr. Richard Green, anthropologist Professor Gregerson, gay S/M activists Gayle Rubin, Jim Ward, Geoff Mains, Tony DeBlase, Dr. Andrew Charles, John Rowberry and Barry Douglas from GMSMA. He also argued that the material had scientific value as the films offer insight into violent psychological dispositions or an unhealthy interest in violence. Toushin's attorneys stated that the films present a problem in that they may appeal to an unhealthy interest in violence. However, to convict Toushin for distributing extremely violent films would be a misuse of obscenity law.
Judge Nixon had consistently demonstrated his displeasure with the U.S. Government for “attempt to fabricate venue.” Within 2 hours of the jury exiting the courtroom for deliberation, the U.S. Government approached Toushin's attorneys and offered to settle the case. Toushin pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to use the U.S. mails to distribute obscene material and the U.S. government agreed to drop proceedings in Utah and Nebraska and to appoint Judge Nixon as the sentencing judge. In August 1989, Judge Nixon ordered Toushin to serve five years probation and fined Toushin's two businesses $250,000 each. The four movies at issue were never confiscated and the U.S. Government did not ask the court to enjoin against their future distribution.

Thaddeus Leavitt

Thaddeus Leavitt (1750–1826) was a Suffield, Connecticut, merchant who invented an early cotton gin, as well as joining with seven other Connecticut men to purchase most of the three-million-plus acres of the Western Reserve lands in Ohio from the government of Connecticut, land on which some of his family eventually settled, founding Leavittsburg, Ohio, and settling in Trumbull County, Ohio. Leavitt served on a commission in the early nineteenth century to settle boundary disputes between Massachusetts and Connecticut, was a director of one of Connecticut's first banks, and was a shipowner whose vessels traded throughout the Atlantic. Leavitt also kept a journal in which he noted everything from the weather to 'cures' for various ailments to the adoption of the United States Constitution.
Thaddeus Leavitt, Esq. was born September 9, 1750 in Suffield to farmer and carpenter John Leavitt and his wife Abiah Kent. Thaddeus Leavitt married Elizabeth King, daughter of Ensign William King of Suffield and his wife Lucy Hatheway. A piece of French furniture was emblazoned with a brass plaque to commemorate the couple's marriage, and given to them, probably by Leavitt's new King in-laws.
Leavitt became an early Suffield merchant, selectman and Justice of the Peace, and was known as 'Squire Leavitt.' He ran a store in Suffield, and from an early age began investing in the shipping business. Leavitt was one of Hartford County's leading citizens, and became wealthy in his dealings as a merchant and shipowner. His ships traded as far afield as the West Indies and other farflung destinations, and the entrepreneurial Leavitt acted as both importer and exporter. Thanks to his increasing wealth, Leavitt built the home later known in Suffield as the Harmon House on High Street.
Eventually Leavitt's business interests extended as far as Spain.
Also investing in the Connecticut Land Company were other of the state's most powerful men. Another investor in the new western lands was Leavitt family relation Oliver Ellsworth, the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, former United States Senator from Connecticut and a chief framer of the United States Constitution. (Ellsworth's share of the Reserve alone came to over and embraced much of modern-day Cleveland). One of the first settlers of the Western Reserve was John Leavitt, brother of Thaddeus and founder of a family who went on to become prominent Ohio citizens.
In 1803 Leavitt was among several Connecticut citizens chosen to resolve a dispute between the states of Connecticut and Massachusetts concerning the border between the two states. (Suffield was once considered part of Massachusetts at the time that Thaddeus Leavitt's ancestor Lieutenant Joshua Leavitt arrived in Suffield from his birthplace in Hingham, Massachusetts). Leavitt was one of a succession of trustees ordered to resolve the ongoing conflict between the two New England states.
Leavitt's appointment to the border commission flowed from his mercantile interests in the region. In 1805, he joined with several citizens of Connecticut and Massachusetts to form a company designated by the legislature as "The Proprietors of the Springfield Bridge". The corporation's aim was building a bridge over the Connecticut River linking West Springfield and Springfield, Massachusetts.
Within the state of Connecticut, Leavitt's interests came to embrace the state's burgeoning development. He served as one of the earliest directors of the newly-incorporated Hartford Bank (later the Hartford National Bank). Merchant Leavitt even had his fingers in the state's agricultural economy, serving on the committee of the Hartford County Agricultural Society.
Unusually for an early merchant, pressed for time, Leavitt kept a long-running diary about events in Suffield and the vicinity. (The diary today is in the collection of the Kent Memorial Library in Suffield, and its pages have been transcribed into a typewritten manuscript for easier reading.) In its pages, Leavitt noted many of the day-to-day occurrences in Suffield, including an entry from December 1, 1802, on a cure for whooping cough; another for a cure for a spider bite; and an entry from March 1803 for "a Receipt instructions for taking film off a horses eye". Leavitt took note of the raising of a new Meeting house, and on February 8, 1788, he made this entry: "We this day have certain Inteligence from the state convention Boston Massachusetts that they have adopted the Feaderal Constitution by a Majority in favr of it of 19--passd 5th Inst."
Thaddeus Leavitt and his wife Elizabeth had two children who married Loomis siblings: a son, Thaddeus Leavitt Jr., who married Jemima Loomis of Suffield; and a daughter Elizabeth Leavitt, who married Jemima's brother Hon. Luther Loomis. Descendants of Thaddeus Leavitt Jr., who also became a Suffield merchant, include his grandsons, the three Hunt brothers: architect Richard Morris Hunt; Boston painter William Morris Hunt; and the lawyer and photography pioneer Leavitt Hunt.
Thaddeus Leavitt Esq., a longtime stalwart of Connecticut's Democratic party, is buried in the Old Burying Ground of the First Congregational Church of Suffield, also known as the First Church of Christ, established in 1698.

In April 1963, Starkey dropped into Football League Division Four with Chester, where he would soon be converted into a full back by new manager Peter Hauser. His spell at Chester would see him not miss a league game in 1964–65 but his career was to finish prematurely early in the 1966–67 season when he suffered a serious illness.
After retiring from playing, Starkey set up a sports shop in Shrewsbury with Dave Pountney and became a coach at his former club Shrewsbury Town. It was the start of a long stint with the club, which included long spells as both secretary and a director of the club.

Annella Zervas

Sister Mary Annella Zervas, Servant of God (born April 7, 1900, Moorhead, Minnesota – died August 14, 1926 Moorhead, Minnesota) was an American Benedictine nun who died after a three-year battle with the skin disease Pityriasis rubra pilaris. Prior to the 1960s, Sister Annella's grave in St. Joseph, Minnesota was considered a place of pilgrimage.
Early life.
Anna Cordelia Zervas was born in Moorhead, Minnesota. Her father, Hubert Zervas, an immigrant from the village of Immekeppel, in the German Empire, was a butcher and ran a local meat market. Her mother, Emma Levitre Zervas, was born in Saint-Theodore-d'Acton, Quebec.
Anna was raised as part of a large family which attended St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Moorhead, where her father was the choir director and a member of the Knights of Columbus. At the time, the parochial school from St. Mary's was looked after by priests and nuns of the Benedictine Order. According to Father Alfred Mayer, O.S.B., who was then Pastor of St. Mary's,"She sought only to please God and do His Holy Will in all things, and thence labored but for God's honor and glory. She sought to please God by an ardent desire and an earnest will to acquire virtue and perfection, a total renunciation and forgetfullness of the world and its vanities, and an invincible fortitude in her sufferings... It was during the summer vacation of 1915 that she one day called on me and expressed to me her desire of going to the convent at St. Joseph and becoming a sister. I told her that I thought she had a religious vocation and advised her to carry out her holy design. She seemed to be so convinced of her religious vocation that she expressed no doubts or fears regarding it. After I had spoken some words to of encouragement and explained to her, in short, the excellence of the religious state, she left happy and contented."
Hubert and Emma Zervas were reportedly very reluctant to part with their daughter at such a young age. Father Alfred, however, advised them, "Don't put anything in her way; she is not too young to give herself to God." Hubert Zervas wrote several years later that he and his wife had then "gladly consented to give back the child to Him from Whom they had received her." 
Benedictine Order.
Anna entered Saint Benedict's Monastery as a postulant in 1915 and entered the novitiate in 1918. She would be remembered as a quiet and unassuming nun who was fond of reading "The Following of Christ" by Geert Groote. 
On June 17, 1918, she received the habit in a ceremony conducted by Bishop Joseph Francis Busch of St. Cloud, Minnesota. According to Dr. James Kritzeck, "This was the day which Anna had so eagerly awaited; in a simple, beautiful ceremony, she exchanged an elegant bridal gown for the severe religious habit. Her expression of happiness upon returning from the sacutary that day was termed 'angelic' by one eyewitness. A notable incident occurred after this ceremony. Anna rushed to tell her parents her new religious name, Sister Mary Annella. Her mother remarked, not unkindly, 'But there is no Saint Annella,' to which Sister Annella, concealing her slight disappointment at this reaction to the name by which she would henceforth be known, replied, 'Then I shall have to be the first one!'" She took her final vows in 1922 and was assigned as a music teacher and organist to St. Mary's Convent in Bismarck, North Dakota.
Affliction.
During the summer of 1923, Zervas noticed a small reddish brown patch on her arm which itched terribly. Despite attempts to quietly bear the disease, the spreading rash soon proved impossible to conceal and soon covered the majority of her body. 
In April 1924, her parents were summoned to her hospital bedside. According to Sister Mary De' Pazzi Zervas, "My parents informed them that they wanted to see Sister Annella. And they were quite concerned about letting her go up, but they said, ‘You wouldn’t have any trouble finding the room.’ They gave her the room number and mother went ahead so fast. I couldn’t keep up with her, she got there first. She looked at the number, the door was partly open. She was going to walk in, but she said, ‘I looked in and I saw someone’s head on the pillow and I thought, oh, it can’t be.’ She didn’t even ask, she just turned to Sister Annella and said, ‘Excuse me, I got the wrong room.’ And Annella broke down; she just screamed, ‘Mama, don’t you know me?!’ Mother said never could she have dreamt that she could change that much in that time. She said she though she was seeing an old man. Her hair was nearly all gone and her face looked terrible, blotchy. She said, ‘I couldn’t ever believe that my Annie could look like that.’"
After their shock wore off, Hubert Zervas recalled, "Her parents were highly edified at her composure, her resignation to her condition… her joyful bearing of an affliction sent by a loving Providence. They remained with her two days, and had many good laughs at Sister Annella’s witty remarks."
In June 1924, Sister Annella was transferred to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. According to Brendan D. King, In Rochester, the doctors noticed that, as she undressed, Sister Annella’s skin was exfoliating in a manner similar to falling snow. After carefully comparing her symptoms against the rare diseases in obscure medical textbooks, the doctors reached a verdict. Sister Annella was suffering from Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris, a skin condition so rare that only six other cases were known to exist in the entire United States. P.R.P., as it is known for short, is an inherited disease usually passed down from parent to child. In the most serious cases, the skin becomes overactive and is unable to regenerate. The blood vessels dilate, which causes the body to hemorrhage moisture. This leaves the weakened immune system quite vulnerable to secondary infections. In some cases, P.R.P. can be fatal. After her diagnosis, Sister Annella was transferred to the Worrell Hospital, where all skin diseases were treated. She was given a great deal of rest and fed a special diet consisting mainly of fish and vegetables. Every one of her nurses expressed revulsion at the task of changing her bandages and asked to be reassigned. There was little improvement, however. Sister Annella’s skin had grown so sensitive that lukewarm water seemed scalding hot. By the beginning of June, a grayish purple coloring began spreading outward from her face. Even hot packs could not stop her teeth from chattering. With the period of examination over, Sister Annella was transferred to St. Raphael’s Hospital in St. Cloud.
During the worst fits of pain, however, Sister Annella would repeat, "Yes, Lord, send me more pain, but give me strength to bear it."
Decline and Death.
In the summer of 1924, Hubert and Emma Zervas paid a visit to Mother Louise Walz, O.S.B., the Abbess of St. Benedict's. According to Sister Mary De' Pazzi Zervas, O.S.B., "…my mother very bravely spoke up and asked Mother ‘If it were possible, could I take her home for a little while to see if I could do something?’ Mother Louise was always so tenderhearted, she almost broke down herself and said, ‘You mean you would try and take care of her now?’ ‘Oh sure, Mother,’ she said, ‘I can’t promise that I’d do the right thing to cure her, but maybe just being in her home and having me take care of her…’ Papa chimed in and said, ‘You know, Mother, we do have an ideal spot. We’re up just a hundred yards from the river… It’s quiet, a wooded area, and there isn’t a lot of goings on at the house.’ Mother Louise just seemed to be dumbfounded; she didn’t have anything to say. She said, ‘Well, wait for me. I have to tend to something and I’ll be right back.’…I didn’t think of that then, but very soon after it dawned on me that she wouldn’t let any of the Sisters be taken out of the Convent without the Bishop’s permission. …I don’t know if I mentioned that to mother or if I was just thinking it and in a few minutes Mother [Louise came back and said, ‘Yes. You may take her with you.’ There was never anything as silent as the parlor that day. …Mother was so pleased and I’ve never seen Mother Louise look like she did that day when she came back with the report."
This in no way altered her status as a religious sister, as the abbess remained carefully informed of Sister Annella's condition. Furthermore, the Benedictine nuns of Moorhead visited regularly and regarded Sister Annella as a part of their community. 
In the fall of 1924, careful dieting and osteopathic treatments brought about a remission of Sister Annella's symptons. Her family was certain that it was only a matter of time before Sister Annella experienced a complete cure and the remission of her symptoms. Sister Annella, however, was unconvinced. She told her mother, “When this disease leaves me, God will have taken it away and he will not want me to have it anymore. I do not want anything but what God wills. Once I was free from this in Bismarck. Thinking that I had not carried my illness the way God wanted me to, I went into the chapel and told Our Lord that if he wanted me to have it all over again, I would carry it as he would want me to. It came back with double force. No, if it leaves me, He will have taken it.” 
Sister Annella also said, "God did not see fit to answer the Little Flower's prayer with a sudden cure. What He has in store for me, I do not know, but all He does is well, so there is no need to worry. God has given me the grace to be resigned, and I thank him heartily for this, but also for all else He has given me with my illness... I often wonder what great harm of body or of soul I may have suffered had not God given me this 'blessing in disguise'"
In the summer of 1926, Sister Annella was attacked bya fit of pain immediately after leaving the confessional. Over the days that followed, the disease and its symptoms returned full force. As a novena was offered for her at Our Lady of Victory Basilica in Lackawanna, New York, her condition seemed to enter its final phase. According to Hubert Zervas,"Lying on her left side, her head slightly bent forward, her eyes partly open, her mouth... drawn in a faint smile, her knees bent, the entire form presenting a picture like the stations where Our Lord lies prostrate under the cross, Sister Annella peacefully breathed her last. Death occurred at 3:15 AM on the Vigil of the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saturday, August 14, 1926. Sister Annella had desired to die before Our Lady's feast, God willing. Our Lord had granted her wish." After a Roman Catholic requiem mass at her parents' parish church in Moorhead, Sister Annella's remains were transported to St. Benedict's and buried in the convent's cemetery.
Legacy.
According to a 1989 newspaper article, "Within seven months of her burial at St. Benedict's Convent, Bishop Joseph Busch was hearing rumors of cures and favors granted through Sister Annella's intercession. He asked Father Alexius Hoffmann, OSB, St. John's Abbey, to collect information on 'the circumstances of her sickness and death and the origin and progress of the cultus, if any, in her regard and any evidences there may be of miraculous intervention through her intercession.' In April 1927, Father Alexius reported to Bishop Busch that five cures had been reported. He also submitted a biographical sketch written by Sister Annella's parents. While there is no evidence that Bishop Busch took further steps in the case, devotion to Sister Annella spread through the efforts of her father and a priest from St. John's Abbey, Father Joseph Kreuter, O.S.B. While the policy of St. Benedict's Convent was to not promote canonization procedures for one of its own members, the sisters fulfilled requests for relics, memorial cards, and biographies."
According to Dr. James Kritzeck, "A short life scetch of Sister Annella's life was written ...by the Reverend Joseph Kreuter, O.S.B., entitled "An Apostle of Suffering in Our Day". This account first appeared in the "Josephinum Weekly", published at that time in Columbus, Ohio, and a German translation, made by the author himself, appeared in "Der Wanderer", a German Catholic weekly published in Saint Paul, Minnesota. "The Grail", a monthly magazine of the Benedictine Abbey at Saint Meinrad, Indiana, reprinted the English article in July 1928, and, to satisfy a large number of requests for copies, published it in booklet form in 1931. A German booklet, reprinted from "Der Wanderer", was issued some time later, and there were also Dutch and Polish translations. A translation into Singhalese, after appearing in a Catholic paper in Ceylon, appeared in booklet form. A French translation, of the same sketch, with a preface by the Very Rev. Canon Cyrille Labrecque of Quebec, was published by the "Librairie d'Action Catholique" in Quebec in 1945. A second edition of the English booklet, published by Saint John's Abbey Press, followed in 1946.
Writing in 1957, Dr. James Kritzeck declared, “It is certainly not out of the question that Sister Annella may one be raised to the honors of the altar. Before that can occur, however, a long and thorough process of examination by the Church must take place. Should that meet with the plan of God, it would certainly be met with the greatest joy on the part of her many fervent admirers all over the world. Yet, as Canon Labrecque reminds us, ‘Whatever may happen, everyone can pray to her and have confidence in her intercession.’”
According to the "Visitor", the official newspaper of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Cloud, "...While the "St. Paul Daily News" exaggerated when it reported that "thousands" were visiting her grave, there were some pilgrims to the convent cemetery, and many of them took a handful of dirt from Sister Annella's grave for a souvenir. Interest in Sister Annella dwindled during the 1960s, but she still has some fans. At least one of them, no one seems to know who, puts flowers on her grave regularly.
Urban Legend.
According to "The Record," a newspaper published by the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University, "Students who need a shoulder to cry on or a little advice can visit the St. Ben’s monastic graveyard. They may be fortunate enough to be greeted by the ghost of S. Annella Zervas. S. Annella belonged to the monastic community at St. Ben’s in the early 20th century. She was believed to be “very holy,” S. Owen said ...Despite the young sister’s death... S. Annella has not left St. Ben’s. Her ghost is said to be seen in the graveyard from time to time as she counsels distressed Bennies as they pass by. Want to pay her a visit? If you’re lucky, you may see the little white cloud that hangs over her grave on some nights, announcing her presence."

The misnomer “The Cave of the Glowing Skulls” was given to the cave because of the way that light reflects off of the calcite deposits found on the skeletal remains found there. The site has gained the interest of archaeologists studying cave burials of Central America and of Mesoamerica as one of the most extensive Early to Middle Pre-Classic (~1000-900 BCE in this case) ossuary cave sites currently known to have been in contact with the Maya societies of nearby Mesoamerica. It provides many valuable clues to how the inhabitants of the Talgua Cave may have been an important link between Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and parts further south and east in Central America and extending into those societies in northern South America, a region known as the Isthmo-Colombian Area.
Modern discovery.
For generations, residents of the nearby areas had known of and visited the cave. The ossuary chamber, however, remained undiscovered until April, 1994. Two Hondurans, Jorge Yáñez and Desiderio Reyes, and two American Peace Corps volunteers, Greg Cabe and Tim Berg were exploring the cave on the east bank of the Talgua River, about four miles from the city of Catacamas, when they first saw human skeletal remains about 2,000 feet inside the cave. After the initial discovery of the remains, James Brady, professor of anthropology at California State University, Los Angeles[http://www.calstatela.edu/academic/anthro/talgua.htm and George Hasemann, head of the archaeology section of Instituto Hondureño Antropología e Historia in Tegucigalpa began investigating the historical implications of the site related to the inhabitants of this region and ancient northeastern Honduras cave burials.
Archaeological investigations.
Traditionally, the majority of the archaeological focus in Honduras has been in the Maya ruins of Copán[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g292022-Copan-Vacations.html], the pinnacle of which is normally associated with the Maya Classic period (~200-900 CE). The recent discovery of the Talgua funerary site has been dated using radiocarbon dating to the Early to Middle Pre-Classic period (~1000 BCE). This type of burial site is normally seen as corresponding to some advancing form of social complexity, which greatly increases the site’s appeal to those interested in the study of societal development in Pre-Columbian Central and Mesoamerica and those societies interacting with the Maya.
During the initial investigation following the discovery of the main ossuary chamber within the cave, another tunnel containing three passageways was found. Within the primary ossuary chamber and the three additional passageways, 23 deposits containing human skeletal remains were discovered, at least 20 of which contained the remains of more than one person. All remains were described as appearing to be secondary burials that were moved from their initial burial sites. The bones were most likely packaged in cloth material and carried into the cave through an old entrance no longer available. Further analysis indicated that the flesh had been removed and the bones were placed in small bundles before arrival to the cave. All of the bones were painted with a red pigment (determined through x-ray diffraction to be red ocher with numerous iron oxides and including hematite). The pigment was also splattered on the ground and walls surrounding the cave, which appears to be due to its rapid and liberal application. All skeletal remains were preserved in and cemented to the ground by calcite.
The water level within the cave made the remains found to be in two different contexts. Natural deterioration due to dripping and damage from vandalism had affected greatly those burials found on ledges and above the water level. However, all of the offerings found in the cave are associated with the burials found above the water line. Burials below the water line were found to be within relatively deep (~ 3 feet) rimstone dams.
In addition to the human skeletal remains, there were at least 20 intact and restorable ceramic vessels found in the cave. At least one of the vessels was “ceremonially killed” by having had a hole punched in the bottom of it. Many of the vessels were positioned in a manner resembling several cave burials at the site of Copán. The investigators of the site, however, have found evidence in further social stratification in the relationships of the vessels to the human remains.
Identity of site's occupants.
Determining the identity and languages of the people whose remains are located in the Talgua Cave has been a complicated and difficult endeavor due to the fact that Rio Talgua, described during the period following the Spanish Conquest, fell on the border of a number of ethnic groups. A Spanish missionary named Father Fernando Espino described the Olancho Valley to be an area containing “more than two-hundred different nations and languages” in 1674. Although there are numerous links between the people of Talgua and the Maya cultures, the site is definitively and categorically not a Mayan site due to location and spoken language. 
Two of the most likely candidates for the lineage of the people at Talgua are the Lenca people and the Pech People (Paya). The Lenca people are generally considered to be Mesoamerican and are now spread among the following western Honduran Municipalities: La Paz Department, Comayagua Department, Intibucá Department, Lempira Department and Santa Bárbara Department. Although, evidence of Pre-Columbian Lencan culture can be traced to the Olancho Valley (Salinas). Pech people, who speak a variation of the Chibchan languages of South America, can still be found in the Olancho Department in the area surrounding the site and along the Rio Talgua, as well as in the Colón Department. Other candidates for descendents include the Tawahka and the Tol people
Despite the difficulty of determining for certain the exact identity of the inhabitants of Talgua, many aspects of their society can be determined with some certainty. Based on finds at the Talgua Cave and at the Talgua Village Site, a definite affiliation with Mesoamerica and the Maya living in the area of Copán has been determined. The people at Talgua were linked in trade with the Maya and, reflected in many of the objects and architecture of the Talgua area, had many similarities to the Maya of the period. In the words of one of the principal investigators of the site, James E. Brady: “To put the Talgua site into Maya perspective, the Talgua people may have been interacting with the Maya and had developed a level of civilization equal to any society known in the Maya area at that time.” 
A surprising find relating to analysis of the bone protein stable isotopes is that the people buried in the cave did not eat an abundance of maize, the cultivation of which is normally seen as corresponding to advancements in social complexity and stratification within Pre-Columbian societies of Mesoamerica and surrounding areas. Instead, researchers suspect that manioc, or cassava root may have been the society’s primary means of subsistence.
Talgua village site.
Along an ancient terrace on the west bank of the Rio Talgua, within a half mile of the cave entrance, a settlement has been unearthed that has since been determined to be the largest site in the country of Honduras from the period. The site extends for over a third of a mile and contains at least 100 standing structures. Many aspects of the settlement (i.e., size, shape, distribution, central plazas, etc.) resemble those of many sites in southeastern Mesoamerica.
Ceramics collected at the settlement were similar to those found at the ossuary, which links the settlement area to the ossuary as the probable area of primary habitation for those people found buried in the Talgua Cave. Ceramics from other sites in Honduras were of very little help in determining the chronology of the Talgua site because the northeast region of Honduras developed independently of other regions throughout the majority of its prehistory.
Trade networks.
Architectural patterns and objects found at the Talgua settlement provide indicators of both social stratification and trade networks with the Maya. Jade and marble vessels found at the site are seen as items of prestige and clues to the degree of social stratification. In addition to the prestige items found, there were numerous items made of obsidian, which would have come from the Maya highland regions and jade from Maya areas of Guatemala. Whereas, items found to be made out of green, jade-like rocks indigenous to northeast Honduras were found not to be Jade at all, but jadeites or green rocks with a distinct talc feel (Cuddy 122). In further exemplification of the role of this area as an important buffer zone between Mesoamerica and southern Central and South America, Doris Stone (1966) has pointed out that much of the area’s later fascination with gold came from the south and fascination with jade came from the Maya in the north. Items and beads of greenstone were in full production by around 500 CE. 
The Cuyamel ceramics found in northeastern Honduras are contemporaneous with the Olmec rise in the Middle Pre-classic period. It has not been definitively determined that Olmec art and culture would have spread to northeastern Honduras during this time period. However, the ceramics are thought to have stylistic similarities to other Pre-Classic Mesoamerican ceramics and the presence of Olmec imagery is documented at Early Pre-Classic villages in northeastern, coastal Honduras, such as Puerto Escondido.
Although not much can be said definitively about trade with Maya during the Early to Middle Pre-Classic, other than that it occurred, there are other, better-documented cases of Maya trade with northeastern Honduras during later periods. For example, the site of Naco was involved in steady trade with Maya areas of the Yucatán and may have been an intermediary trade location between the Maya and other cultures of Central America just prior to arrival of the Spaniards.

Great Contemporaries

Great Contemporaries is a collection of 25 short biographical essays about famous people, written by Winston Churchill.
The original collection of 21 essays published in 1937 were mainly written between 1928 and 1931. Four were added to the book in the 1939 edition, about Lord Fisher, Charles Stewart Parnell, Lord Baden-Powell and Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1941 the essays on Boris Savinkov and Leon Trotsky were removed from editions published at that time, since they had been opponents of Joseph Stalin, who as leader of Russia was now officially an ally of Britain against Germany in World War II, and the article on Roosevelt was removed in 1942 when America also became officially an ally of Britain with Roosevelt as president. The Odhams edition of 1947 reinstated the three essays after the war.
Other subjects of the essays were Earl of Rosebery, Kaiser Wilhelm II, George Bernard Shaw, Joseph Chamberlain, Sir John French, John Morley, Hindenburg, Herbert Asquith, Lawrence of Arabia, the Earl of Birkenhead, Marshal Foch, Alfonso XIII, Douglas Haig, Arthur James Balfour, Adolf Hitler, George Nathaniel Curzon, Philip Snowden, Clemenceau, and George V.

George Knightley

George Knightley is a principal character depicted by Jane Austen in her novel "Emma", written in 1816. He is a very wealthy landowner and a lifetime friend of Emma's, though he is nearly seventeen years older than she. He enjoys correcting Emma, as Emma observes in chapter 1.
Character.
A kind and compassionate person, Mr Knightley portrays good judgment, high moral character and maturity in contrast to Emma's adolescent personality. One incident which displays this is his disappointment when he sees Emma insult Miss Bates, a spinster of modest means. Mr. Knightley's later reprimand of Emma also demonstrates his affection and esteem for her as a friend. Another incident which shows his quality is his anger with Emma for persuading Harriet Smith to refuse Robert Martin's proposal of marriage, Martin being in Knightley's eyes an eminently suitable mate for Harriet.
Role in narrative.
In the course of the story, Emma falls briefly in love with a young, handsome man named Frank Churchill. Mr. Knightley's jealousy is implied, and he makes several negative remarks about Churchill. It is later revealed that Mr. Knightley was afraid that Frank has had a negative influence on Emma. Frank Churchill's guardian—his aunt—dies, and he is now free to publicize his engagement to Jane Fairfax, which had been kept secret to avoid his aunt's disapproval. Emma is shocked, but realizes she had never really had romantic sentiments towards Frank Churchill. Nevertheless, she worries that Harriet has feelings for Frank, but soon discovers that Harriet has become infatuated with Mr. Knightley.
Emma becomes very unhappy; finally it dawns on her that she loves Mr. Knightley—and has for a time, apparently unconsciously—and is distressed as she believes Mr. Knightley and Harriet to be on the verge of marriage. Mr. Knightley is in London, visiting John and Isabella Knightley when he is apprised of Churchill's clandestine engagement. He decided to return to Hartfield to offer support to Emma, whom he believes to be deeply in love with Mr. Churchill. On the spur of the moment, after finding this to be untrue, he declares his love to Emma and asks her to marry him, and she accepts. Harriet and Robert Martin marry; Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill plan a November wedding. Within a month, Emma and Mr. Knightley marry and, because Mr. Woodhouse can't face life without his daughter, Mr. Knightley gallantly moves in with Emma and her father at their estate, Hartfield.

<doc id="20670561" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20670561" title="No nit policy">
No nit policy

No nit policy is a treatment system recommended by health authorities in the USA, Canada and Australia to assist in the elimination of "head lice infestation". The "no nit" policy requires the sending home and barring of all children who have head lice, eggs and/or nits on their hair from controlled settings such as school, summer camp or day care facilities.
The no nit policy involves a number of issues, such as the circumstances under which children will be inspected, the criteria to infer infestation, the procedures for dealing with infested children upon discovery, and the criteria to permit previously infested children to return to school. These issues are controversial. In particular, a number of health researchers and organizations object to the required removal of nits. Opponents to the no-nit policy point out that nits, being empty eggshells, have no clinical importance. Time-consuming nit removal, therefore, has no direct effect on transmission. This has led to the perception that the no-nit policy serves only to ease the workload of school nurses. Proponents of the no-nit policy counter that only a consistently nit-free child can be reliably shown to be infestation-free. That is, the presence of nits serves as a proxy for infestation status. Proponents argue that such a proxy is necessary because lice screening is prone to false negative conclusions (i.e., failure to find lice present on actively infested children).
Contributing to the controversial nature of school head lice policies is a lack of available data on their importance and efficacy. For example, , the transmissibility of head lice in school settings is largely unknown. Further, control-matched studies of the effect of specific school policies on head lice incidence are also lacking.
Schools in developed countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia commonly exclude infested students, and prevent return of those students until all lice, eggs, and nits are removed. Policies in the United Kingdom extend to legal action against parents of infested students. Attitudes in developing countries are often quite different. Many societies consider head louse infestation to be normal, if even remarked upon at all.
Inspection.
A 1991 survey of American nurses reported that 27% have regular inspection programs in place at their schools. 85% reported inspection on an "as-needed" basis. Routine inspection of children is advocated by a variety of nurses, researchers, organizations, and governments.
Head lice cannot live more than a day or two away from a host. Any remaining eggs will hatch in one to two weeks, and absent a host, the emerging nymphs will die within hours. Thus, simply leaving the school vacant for a week or two is sufficient to disinfect all fomite sources of head louse infection. The return of children to this now-clean environment is an ideal time to check for infestations and attempt to keep the environment lice-free. The California Department of Public Health encourages inspections to be performed on Fridays.
Some health researchers oppose regular inspections. This opposition to school inspections coincides with opposition to no-nit policies, and is based on similar reasoning (i.e., that they are ineffective).
Lice infestation is not a reportable disease, so data on head lice incidence are sparse. , no control-matched study exists on the effect of school screening programs on head lice prevalence. Further, although some authors note a stubborn prevalence of head lice during the latter half of the 20th century, this has occurred in an environment of rather lax screening efforts. For example, a 1991 survey of American nurses reported that only 27% had regular screening programs in place at their schools. Anecdotal evidence suggests that school screening programs "can" reduce head lice prevalence. Certainly, the effectiveness of these programs must be determined before their "cost effectiveness" can be evaluated.
Barbara Frankowski, a critic of school screenings, argues that time spent screening children by school nurses is better spent on other tasks. This attitude reflects those held by some American school nurses themselves, 27% of whom believe that eliminating lice infestations in "not" an important role of school nursing. Even more telling, only 11% of American school nurses find treating head lice to be professionally gratifying. Similar attitudes exist among Canadian school nurses.
School inspections are often short—about one minute per child. Frankowski argues that such inspections are not thorough enough to be accurate, and so may lead to a false sense of security. Indeed, a 1998 study of Israeli children found that live lice took an average of 57 – 116 seconds to detect depending on the technique used. L. Keoki Williams and others acknowledge this shortcoming of school screening, and suggest that children found to have nits undergo an additional 5- to 10-minute examination to exclude the presence of live lice. In contrast, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) argues not for increased inspection time, but elimination of the school screenings altogether, with parents being educated and encouraged to inspect their own children at home. This attitude, coupled with the AAP's opposition to the no-nit policy, would essentially absolve school administrators of responsibility to directly manage pediculosis in their student body.
Nits.
A nit is the egg of a louse. They are white - resembling dandruff, 0,8mm long, cement to the hair base where they are difficult to remove, and may survive for three weeks away from the host.
Only the presence of live crawling lice (nymph or imago) constitutes an infestation. Much of the controversy surrounding school head lice policy centers on the question of what to do with children discovered to have nits, but no visible lice. Indeed, one-third to three-fourths of children with nits fall into this category. The nits-only population therefore represents a significant fraction of children potentially subject to school exclusion and/or treatment with insecticides. Such children have evidence of infestation (i.e., the nits), but the infestation may be extinct.
Unfortunately, false negative conclusions (i.e., failing to find lice that are, in fact, present) regarding infestation have long been recognized as a problem in head lice diagnosis. Depending on the methods used, live lice can be easily missed during inspection. For example, a 1998 Israeli study found that 76% of live lice infestations were missed by visual inspection (as verified by subsequent combing methods). Although lice cannot fly or jump, they are fast and agile in their native environment (i.e., clinging to hairs near the warmth of the scalp), and will try to avoid the light used during inspection. Lice populations are also sparse, which can contribute to difficulty in finding live specimens. Two-thirds of infestations are composed of 10 or fewer individual lice. Further, lice populations consist predominantly (80%-90%) of immature nymphs, which are even smaller and harder to detect than adult lice.
These difficulties have, at times, lead to the recommendation that the presence of nits alone be used to infer infestation:
A 1998 American study attempted to clarify the infestation risk associated with a "nits-only" diagnosis. They found that 18% of children with nits (but no apparent lice) became infested (i.e., lice appeared) 14 days later. Whether these new lice came from viable eggs or via transmission from other hosts was not clear. Transmission from other hosts would tend to overestimate the infestation risk associated with nits. In addition, some children were treated with pediculicides during this 14 day period. Successful treatments (i.e., killing eggs or recently hatched nymphs) would tend to underestimate the infestation risk associated with nits. These limitations of the study notwithstanding, the authors concluded:
Although "nits-only" children are unlikely to become infested, this is not to say that a nit-free population is without value. Much of the difficulty in accurately diagnosing head lice stems from the possibility that observed nits are due to an extinct infestation. However, if a policy of required nit removal is enforced, this is no longer an issue. Against a background of nit-free children, spotting new infestations through routine screening becomes as easy as spotting the nits. This ease in screening comes at a price, though, namely the effort expended (typically by parents) in removing nits. And to the extent that no-nit policies result in absenteeism, the child's education suffers, and the school's funding (e.g., from government sources) may be reduced.
Discovery of infested students.
Immediate exclusion from school.
Discovery of infested students typically occurs during a school day. Assuming the presence of live lice is the criteria used to infer infestation, an ethical dilemma is presented to school nurses and administrators. Should this student, now known to be infectious, be returned to class where transmission to other students could occur? Or alternatively, should the student be immediately removed from the group setting? Schools have very limited capacity to individually supervise students outside of the classroom, so removal from the classroom means requesting that the child's parents pick up their child.
Parents often become upset when the school nurse telephones their place of employment to inform them of their child's infestation and to request they come and collect their child. Nonetheless, immediate exclusion policies are explicitly advocated by some nurses. A 1998 survey revealed that almost all (96%) American school nurses send home infested students upon discovery.
Opponents to immediate exclusion policies point out that the discovery of infestation is merely recognition of what has been an infectious condition for a number of months. Given that context, they argue, one more day of group contact is unlikely to result in more transmission than has already occurred. This contrasts with more short-term and highly communicable viral diseases such as chickenpox, influenza, or measles where immediate exclusion might reasonably reduce disease spread within the school.
The value of immediate exclusion for lice depends to some extent on the frequency of asymptomatic screening at the school. More frequent screening would tend to decrease the average time between infestation and discovery of that infestation. This would make the one day associated with immediate exclusion a more significant fraction of the total time the student was infectious. But even ardent supporters of asymptomatic screening do not advocate screenings more than once every three months. This suggests that the effect of immediate exclusion might be an exposure time reduction of as little as 1.6%, even under strict screening guidelines.
These changing attitudes on immediate exclusion appear to be affecting public policy. For example, in Australia, the National Health and Medical Research Council states that infested children need not be sent home upon discovery. Similarly, the California Department of Public Health advocates a head lice policy that does not immediately exclude infested children.
Communicability in school settings.
Evaluating immediate exclusion policies is difficult, because the communicability of head lice in school settings has not been carefully studied. This has not, however, prevented authors from confidently asserting their opinion:
Two studies have noted clustering of head louse infestation by classroom. However, the authors differ in their interpretation of this clustering. In 1997, Richard Speare and Petra Buettner noted prevalence ranges of 0% to 72.2% across classrooms in the same grade (3rd) and in the same Australian school. This led them to favor the idea that "opportunities for transmission are prominent within the classroom". Indeed, their data suggest that classrooms synchronize in terms of infestation status.
In contrast, Janis Hootman suggests that school communicability is low. In 1998 she found that infestations within American classrooms were restricted to a minority of chronically infested students. Hootman concluded that the infested students have access to an infectious source that their classmates do not. Similarly, she found that clusters of pediculosis within classrooms were associated social interactions outside school (e.g., sleepovers). This indicates that transmission can occur between classmates, but again, these transmission events may be occurring away from school grounds.
Barring return to school.
After identifying and isolating an infested student, school policy typically requires some sort of verification that the student is no longer infectious before being readmitted to the school. Typically, this involves inspecting the child for evidence of continued infestation (see Criteria to infer infestation above). Schools commonly enforce either a "no-nit" policy or a "no-lice" policy.
The no-nit policy.
No-nit policies bar readmission of students found to have lice, eggs, or nits. This policy is popular with health authorities in the United States, Canada, and Australia. A 1998 survey revealed that a majority (61%) of American school nurses prevent return of treated students to school if they are not (also) nit-free. A similar percentage (60%) felt that "forced absenteeism of any child who has any nits in their hair is a good idea." Data from a primarily American study during 1998–1999 revealed even higher prevalence—no-nit policies were present at 82% of the schools attended by children suspected of louse infestation.
James H. Price and colleagues estimate that infested students lose two to four days of school for treatment and nit removal. Based on their 1998 survey of American school nurses, they estimate that approximately 6 million U.S. children lose 12 to 24 million child-schooldays annually due to lice infestation under no-nit policies.
Controversy surrounding no-nit policy.
Although the no-nit policy has the appearance of a simple and popular tool against pediculosis transmission, its implementation has been opposed by a number of health researchers and organizations. Opponents argue that enforcement of no-nit policies has not significantly reduced head lice incidence in school settings, and that the risks and disadvantages of the no-nit policies outweigh their associated benefits.
As is the case in assessing school screening efforts (see Screening above), assessing the effectiveness of no-nit policies is complicated by the sparseness of head lice prevalence data. To the extent that no-nit policies increase the efficiency of school screening programs (see Benefits of nit-free population above), no-nit policies may lead to more rapid containment of head lice outbreaks. However, , the correlation between no-nit policies and head lice incidence has not been examined.
Inherent conflict over no-nit policy.
Kosta Y. Mumcuoglu and colleagues indict required nit removal policies as an attempt to minimize the effort expended by school nurses on differentiating active and extinct infestations. They further argue that this minimization comes at the expense of excessive efforts on the part of parents to remove signs of previous infestations (i.e., the nits), which have no clinical importance.
The difficulty parents face in advocating more lax attitudes towards children with nits, is that the parents have no concomitant guarantee from school administrators that those admitted children will truly be lice-free. Indeed, admitting children with nits "increases" the difficulty in identifying actively infested students (see Criteria to infer infestation above). In contrast to diseases such as measles or influenza, pediculosis does not inherently prevent school attendance. The financial incentive for schools, therefore, is to minimize expenditures on lice control and screening programs because (absent a no-nit policy) they have little effect on attendance. This is a formula for maximizing lice infestation within the student body, not minimizing it. Thus, while the no-nit policy may be seen as off-loading school nurse responsibilities to parents, it is perhaps more correctly viewed as imposing parental priorities on school administrators.
In the absence of such policies, school and parental priorities with respect to lice are inherently at odds. The parents wish to minimize lice transmission. In contrast, schools wish to maximize attendance, which is largely unaffected by lice transmission. Barring return of children until nits are removed has the effect of transforming the pediculosis "problem" for which schools have no inherent incentive to solve, into an attendance "problem" for which schools have a direct financial interest. Unfortunately, the solution advocated by many to this attendance "problem" is to simply remove the no-nit policy, leaving the inherent conflict between parents and school administrators unaddressed.
The no-lice policy.
The no-lice policy bars readmission of students with crawling lice, but are indifferent to the presence of eggs and nits. These policies are advocated by a number of government agencies, but , no data on the overall prevalence of no-lice policies exists. In Australia, the National Health and Medical Research Council states that treated children can return with nits so long as they are lice-free. Similarly, the California Department of Public Health advocates a policy that permits students to return to school with nits.

SM U-70

SM "U-70 was a Type U 66 submarine or U-boat for the German Imperial Navy () during the First World War. She had been laid down in February 1914 as U-11" the final boat of the "U-7" class for the Austro-Hungarian Navy () but was sold to Germany, along with the others in her class, in November 1914.
The submarine was ordered as "U-11" from Germaniawerft of Kiel as the last of five boats of the "U-7" class for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Austro-Hungarian Navy became convinced that none of the submarines of the class could be delivered to the Adriatic via Gibraltar. As a consequence, the entire class, including "U-11", was sold to the German Imperial Navy in November 1914. Under German control, the class became known as the U 66 type and the boats were renumbered; "U-11" became "U-70", and all were redesigned and reconstructed to German specifications. "U-70" was launched in July 1915 and commissioned in September. As completed, she displaced , surfaced, and , submerged. The boat was long and was armed with five torpedo tubes and a deck gun.
A part of the 4th Flotilla throughout the war, "U-70" sank 53 merchant ships with a combined gross register tonnage (GRT) of 137,775. Included in that total was —at , one of the largest ships of the war sunk by a U-boat—sunk in June 1917. In addition she sank one British and damaged four merchant ships (). On 20 November 1918, nine days after the Armistice, "U-70" was surrendered to the British. She was broken up at Bo'ness in 1919–20.
Design and construction.
After the Austro-Hungarian Navy had competitively evaluated three foreign submarine designs, it selected the Germaniawerft 506d design, also known as the Type UD, for its new "U-7" class of five submarines. The Navy ordered five boats on 1 February 1913.
The "U-7" class was seen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy as an improved version of its "U-3" class, which was also a Germaniawerft design. As designed for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the boats were to displace on the surface and while submerged. The doubled-hulled boats were to be long (OA) with a beam of and a draft of . The Austrian specifications called for two shafts with twin diesel engines ( total) for surface running at up to , and twin electric motors ( total) for a maximum of when submerged. The boats were designed with five torpedo tubes; four located in the bow, one in the stern. The boats' armament was to also include a single 66 cm/26 (2.6 in) deck gun.
"U-11" was laid down on 11 February 1914, the final boat of the class begun. Her construction was slated to be complete within 29 to 33 months.
Neither "U-11" nor any of her sister boats were complete when World War I began in August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians became convinced that it would be impossible to take delivery of the boats, which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, "U-11" and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914.
"U-11" was renumbered by the Germans as "U-70" when her class was redesignated as the Type U 66. The Imperial German Navy had the submarines redesigned and reconstructed to German standards, which increased the surface displacement by and the submerged by . The torpedo load was increased by a third, from 9 to 12, and the deck gun was upgraded from the gun originally specified to an one.
Early career.
"U-70" was launched on 20 July 1915. On 22 September, SM "U-70" was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy under the command of Kapitänleutnant Otto Wünsche. "U-70" was the second U-boat command for the 30-year-old officer; he had commanded from August 1914 until a week before assignment to "U-70".
In January 1916, Wünsche and "U-70" escorted the German blockade runner "Marie" through the North Sea. On 9 February, "U-70" was assigned to the 4th Flotilla () in which she remained for the duration of the war. "U-70" served as an escort again in late February, when she accompanied the German merchant raider Greif.
The second German offensive.
Germany began its second submarine offensive against shipping in February 1916, the month "U-70" had joined the 4th Flotilla. As in the first submarine offensive, U-boats were sent independently around Scotland to patrol the Irish Sea and the western entrance to the English Channel. "U-70" sank her first ship on 16 March, when she dispatched the British sailing vessel "Willie" northwest by west of Fastnet Rock. The same day she also damaged the British cargo ship "Berwindale", en route to Avonmouth with a load of wheat from Galveston, Texas. Throughout the rest of March and into early April, "U-70" sank an additional five ships of ; the largest being the British cargo vessel "Eagle Point", carrying a load of hay and oats from Saint John, New Brunswick, torpedoed and sunk on 28 March. Near the end of April 1916, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the new commander-in-chief of the High Seas Fleet (under which "U-70"s 4th Flotilla operated), called off the merchant shipping offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return, and all boats in port to remain there.
Grand Fleet ambush.
In mid-May, Scheer completed plans to draw out part of the British Grand Fleet. The German High Seas Fleet would sortie for a raid on Sunderland, luring the British fleet across "'nests' of submarines and mine-fields". "U-70" was one of four U-boats that put out to sea beginning on 18 May to scout the central North Sea for signs of the British fleet. Completing five days of scouting, "U-70", along with , , , sister boat , , and , took up position off the Firth of Forth on 23 May. The other two other boats, and , were stationed off Pentland Firth, in position to attack the British fleet leaving Scapa Flow. All the boats were to remain on station until 1 June and await a coded message which would report the sailing of the British fleet. Unfortunately for the Germans, the British Admiralty had intelligence reports of the departure of the submarines which, coupled with an absence of attacks on shipping, aroused British suspicions.
A delayed departure of the German fleet for its sortie (which had been redirected to the Skagerrak) and the failure of five U-boats to receive the coded message warning of the British advance caused Scheer's anticipated ambush to be a "complete and disappointing failure". Although "U-70" had received the advance warning of the coded message, her crew did not ever see any part of the fleet. The failure of the submarine ambush to sink any British capital ships allowed the full Grand Fleet to engage the numerically inferior High Seas Fleet in the Battle of Jutland, which took place 31 May – 1 June.
"U-70"s next success came in December when she sank the 5,587-ton British steamer "Pascal" on 17 December. Over the next month she sank an additional 15 ships ().
Unrestricted submarine warfare.
From the early stages of the war the British had blockaded Germany, preventing neutral shipping from reaching German ports. By the time of the so-called "turnip winter" of 1916–17, the blockade had severely limited imports of food and fuel into Germany. Among the results were an increase in infant mortality and as many as 700,000 deaths attributed to starvation or hypothermia during the war. With the blockade having such dire consequences, Kaiser Wilhelm II personally approved a to begin on 1 February 1917 to help force the British to make peace. The new rules of engagement specified that no ship was to be left afloat.
The first recorded action of "U-70" under the new rules of engagement occurred near the end of February 1917, when the U-boat shelled the British-flagged "SS San Patricio". The tanker, encountered by "U-70" off the Orkney Islands, survived the attack. In March, "U-70" sank twelve ships totaling 25,708 tons and damaged a thirteenth of 4,666 tons.
During the month of April 1917, German U-boats succeeded in sinking 860,334 tons of Allied and neutral shipping, a total unsurpassed by any month in either of the two world wars. "U-70"s contribution came in the form of ten ships of 23,530 tons sent to the bottom, four of them on the same day, 24 April.
Although the monthly total of tonnage sunk by all U-boats had peaked in April, the losses were over 600,000 tons in each of May and June. "U-70" did not contribute to the May tally but her commanding officer, Wünsche, was awarded the House Order of Hohenzollern. "U-70" began another productive month in June by sinking the American Line ocean liner on 4 June. At , "Southland" was the largest ship sunk by "U-70", and one of the largest ships sunk during the war by a U-boat. "Southland" was carrying a general cargo from Liverpool to Philadelphia when "U-70" sank her at position , some from Tory Island. Throughout the rest of June, "U-70" sank another seven ships totaling 26,131 tons.
After June 1917, "U-70" only sank another three ships throughout the rest of the war, one of which was the British on 5 May 1918. "Rhododendron" had been constructed in 1917 as a purpose built Q-ship, a warship disguised as a merchant ship to lure German submarines within range of their concealed gun batteries. The sloop was patrolling off Mull Head in the Orkney Islands when struck by a single torpedo from "U-70". The captain, Lieutenant Commander Charles Arthur Peal, became disoriented in the aftermath of the explosion, and instead of ordering away a "panic party" to draw the submarine within range, ordered the complete evacuation of the ship, which was carried out in great haste and confusion. "U-70" approached the burning ship and observed the chaotic evacuation, seizing a petty officer from a liferaft who revealed the ship's true identity. "U-70" shelled the wreck and escaped without coming under fire. "Rhododendron" capsized and sank the following morning, with the loss of 15 men, four killed in the explosion and 11 drowned during the evacuation. Peal and the rest of the crew were heavily criticized for their conduct under fire by an Admiralty board.
In total "U-70" sank 54 ships with a combined tonnage of 139,065 and damaged four with a tonnage of 20,369 in her twelve war patrols. She was surrendered to the British on 20 November 1918, nine days after the Armistice, and broken up at Bo'ness in 1919–20.

Sy Syms

Sy Syms (May 12, 1926 – November 17, 2009) was an American businessman, entrepreneur and philanthropist, who founded the SYMS off-price clothing chain in New York City in 1959.
Syms was born Seymour Merinsky on May 12, 1926, in Brooklyn, New York. He was the youngest of eight children to Jewish parents who emigrated from Russia. His family decided to change their surname from Merinsky to Merns when his father and son opened a store on Vesey Street in Lower Manhattan which was also called Merns. Syms went to Midwood High School in Brooklyn. After serving in the United States Army, he attended New York University on the G.I. Bill.
He initially began a career as a sportscaster and reporter in Maryland and West Virginia. However, in 1950 Syms returned to New York in order to work at the family's store, Merns.
In 1959, Syms opened a men's clothing store on nearby Cortlandt Street in New York City's Financial District. The store, which was initially named Sy Merns, competed directly with his family's original store on Vesey Street. However, he was forced to change the store's name to simply, SYMS, after legal action was taken against him. He later had his name legally changed to Sy Syms to match the store.
The company slowly expanded during the 1960s and 1970s. The company aired its first television commercial in 1974. In the commercial, SYMS debuted the company's slogan, "An educated consumer is our best customer." The slogan is still used by SYMS as of April 2011.
By 1983, Syms had taken the company public with an initial public offering and expanded the chain to include eleven retail locations. The chain now has approximately 30 locations in thirteen states. Sy Syms remained the company's CEO until his retirement in 1998, when he was succeeded by his daughter, Marcy Syms.
On November 2, 2011, Syms Corp. and its subsidiary Filene's Basement, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after more than a half a century in the clothing business.
Sy Syms remained the company's chairman until he died of heart failure at his home in Manhattan, New York City on November 17, 2009. He was survived by his wife, Lynn Tamarkin Syms; four children, Marcy, Robert, Richard and Laura; two stepchildren; 10 grandchildren; and three sisters. Two of his children, Stephen and Adrienne, predeceased him.

Enlaces

Enlaces is a Chilean educational program designed to create a structural change in Chilean education in order to prepare youth, along with their parents and guardians, to participate in the emergent society of knowledge, and to create networks of communication that help integrate them with the world. Enlaces was started in 1992 by Chile's Ministry of Education.
Test phase.
The testing phase of this program began in 12 schools in Santiago, the capital of Chile. After 3 years the program had extended to the Ninth Region, the Araucanía Region, (the part of the country with the largest indigenous population) with more than 100 schools participating in the program. When the government decided that this project was viable, it focused all of its efforts on the spread of this program to all the regions of the country.
First phase.
From 1995-2007 (the unofficial First Phase of the Enlaces project), the government spent more than $121 million and international cooperation from organizations such as the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) in global education, infrastructure, computers, access to educational recourses, technical assistance, and teacher training. In 2003, in order to continue their efforts to connect the country, the Ministry of Education signed an agreement with local telecommunication companies to offer low-cost broadband connection for educational institutions. Sixty percent of the students in Chile have access to broadband internet because of this agreement. In 2007, the Enlaces Program had 3,372,943 students, and 95% of the students in the country have access to computer.
Future plans.
In 2007, the Chilean Ministry of Education presented ExpoEnlaces 2007 where they showcased the latest innovations in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) so that people can understand the abilities of these new technologies and their uses in the classroom. That same year, the Ministry of Education published its new objectives and projects for the coming years. Didier de Saint Pierre, the executive director of Enlaces, divided the program into two phases, the first phase, which is coming to a close, focused on infrastructure in the schools and equipping them to install the necessary programs and administration. The second phase involves developing the technological infrastructure so that it has the capacity to improve the quality of learning in Chile. Once the basic technological infrastructure is in place, the Ministry will extend the technology to the remaining schools in less developed regions, and it will implement new technologies in the more advanced regions.
Examples of the new technologies that Enlaces will implement are electronic whiteboards for math, palm pilots or pocket PCs for physics, and projectors for teaching sciences. Other new strategies will include ICT in the classroom, where they will integrate portable technology and projectors in 3,000 classrooms, benefiting 87,000 students (3% of the total number of students). The goal is to implement this program in 16,000 classrooms by 2010.
The science program is a good example of the direction in which the Enlaces program is headed. A very important aspect of this program is teaching style. Enlaces encourages the use of the HEI (hypothesis, experimentation, instruction) method. The new science classes are being developed in a multimedia format using simulations delivered via the internet.
This new program offers students many benefits. The classes that follow this methodology better prepare students for lessons and projects. When presented with an experiment, students can form a hypothesis, the teacher can demonstrate every aspect of the experiment using a computer, a projection system, and the internet, and the students can follow the other steps of the scientific method. While the use of simulations is not the exactly the same as doing the physical experiment, simulation eliminates the problem of lack of equipment and materials (such as chemicals for chemistry, and animals for dissection for biology) that many schools in Chile face.
Adult Education.
Part of the objective of the Enlaces program is to help the community through adult education. The idea was that children would bring the technology home with them, but this has not worked the way the Ministry had hoped. The majority of parents (especially those in rural areas) recognize the benefits of technology for their children, but feel that they cannot benefit personally. For adults who do want to learn more about technology, the Enlaces program offers an 18 hour digital literacy class where they learn the basic functions of a computer, how to use a word processor, how to use the internet, and how to create and use an email account.

Lagunas de Zempoala National Park

Lagunas de Zempoala National Park (nahuatl language: Place of many Waters) is a natural protected area which consists of a group of seven lagoons. The park is located between the states of Morelos and State of Mexico, Mexico.
Geography.
The lagunas of Zempoala are located in biological corridor named Chichinautzin, between the municipalities of Ocuilan de Arteaga, at the southwestern section of State of Mexico and Huitzilac, northwestern section of the state of Morelos, 50 km away from Mexico City.
The National Park covers about 4,700 hectares and lies at an elevation of about 2,900 meters (9500 feet) above sea level.
The Park.
The Park consists of seven lagoons, their names are Zempoala, Compila, Tonatihua, Seca, Ocoyotongo, Quila y Hueyapan which are supplied with water through the rivers descending from the Ajusco and the surrounding mountains, they are also supplied by rain; three of the lagoons have water the whole year and the other four are seasonal.
The three main lagoons, which are the year-lasting are
Zempoala- It is the biggest of all lagoons, here are located the tourist services. The parks security do not recommend swimming here because of the sediment.
Tonatihua- This is the less visited lagoon, which makes it easier for tourists to hear the birds and see animals like rabbits or squirrels.
Prieta- This lagoon is more visited than tonatihua because this is a good place for camping, tourists can also practice sports like hiking and horseback riding.
Flora and fauna.
The abundant forests surrounding the park include different types of trees such as oaks, cedars, pine trees and firs.
In the park there is a possibility of finding a great variety of mammals such as deer, foxes, weasels, rabbits, squirrels, skunks, birds (such as falcons, hummingbirds and sparrows), and amphibians such as the Axolotl.
Decree.
The Zempoala lagoons were granted the title of national park on November 27, 1936 by the president of Mexico, and the decree was modified in May 1947 to reduce the parks territory to its current 4,700 hectares.

With their own fleet, consisting of twin-engined machines of the type Britten-Norman Islander and brand new Cessna 172 SP, AIR HAMBURG daily navigates in a scheduled air service, the North Sea islands from their base airport in Hamburg-Uetersen or alternatively the airport Fuhlsbüttel.
Air Hamburg Private Jets.
Air Hamburg also operates a fleet of Cessna Citation Private Jet aircraft capable of flights to any destination.
The Citation fleet contains the models: Citation 525, Citation Bravo and the flagship Citation XLS+. With the major jet you reach a location within a range of 2500 mi (non-stop) and a maximum speed of 500 mph.
Café Himmelsschreiber.
AIR HAMBURG operates the Café Himmelsschreiber (skywriter) next to the general aviation centre (GAT) at the airport Fuhlsbuettel. With this location, the company can offer their aircraft passengers the comfort of an exclusive lounge before takeoff.
Flight School Hamburg.
The Flight School Hamburg - one of the largest flight schools of the country - guarantees a qualified, solid training within the guidelines of JAR-FCL. The Flight School is one of the LBA accepted FTO (flight training organisation), which trains not only private- also professional and traffic pilots.
The following licenses can be acquired: PPL (A), IR (A), CPL (A) and ATPL (A). The pilot training takes place on 365 days a year. Approximately 100 flying students acquire their flight licence in the Flight School Hamburg annually.
History.
Originally the two young entrepreneurs Floris Helmers and Alexander Lipsky conducted the Flight School Hamburg and enlarged it in the last years. Frequently the two were asked more often not only for flying hours, but for sightseeing and taxi flights to the North and East Frisian Islands. Because of that the company was extended with the name AIR HAMBURG with single and twin-engined aircraft for sightseeing- and island flights in 2005.
The island flight plan was extended already: Besides Sylt, the destinations reached out to Helgoland, Juist and Norderney.
There were more and more charter inquiries to destinations, which could not be offered with the fleet for the island air traffic due to the limited range. The result of this development was the logical step for the establishment of the brand AIR HAMBURG Private Jets with comfortable business jets, which are positioned at the airport Hamburg.
Destinations.
Business charters.
Air Hamburg offers many business charter flights on demand across Europe. The charter base is Uetersen Airport.

Antonio Membrado

Antonio Membrado (born March 21, 1935 in Madrid) is a Spanish classical guitarist. He settled in France in 1959. He was a student of Andrés Segovia, and gave many concerts in France and abroad.
Biography.
In 1945, Antonio Membrado started playing the "laud", a melodic instrument popular in Spain, used in the rondallas (small ensembles plucking instruments with plectrum such as bandurria or laud, and with fingers, such as guitar). At 13, the excellent guitarist Manuel Hernandez initiates his future musician career. He also studies the piano at the Madrid Conservatory with Pedro Carre, pianist and composer.
In 1952, Antonio Membrado has a decisive meeting with Regino Sainz de la Maza and enters the Madrid Academia guitar class. In 1956, he unanimously wins the Madrid Conservatory Extraordinary Prize. At 17 he also begins to appear in his first guitar recitals in Spain: Madrid, Valencia, Barcelona, etc…
At 21, Antonio Membrado meets for the first time Andrés Segovia at the Musical Academia Chigiana in Italy. Antonio Membrado will be part of it until 1959. This was then the where-to-go international academy of the new guitarists generation. Andrés Segovia will ask Membrado to deliver the Academy closing concerts in 1958 and 1959.
In September 1956, Antonio Membrado wins the First Medal of the International Competition in Geneva.
His international career begins in 1959: France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, the United States, etc...
From 1963 on, various recordings are published: Vivaldi, Schubert, Bach, Villa-Lobos, Brouwer, Burchard, Milan, Membrado, etc... 1975 is marking the publication of the live recording of his concert at the Lincoln Center in New York.
Antonio Membrado arranges for Paco Ibáñez and accompanies him with the guitar for his first LP in 1964.
In parallel to his concert performer career, Antonio Membrado serves as guitar teacher at the national Academy of Bourg-la-Reine, where he trains numerous pupils many of them embracing professional music careers.
Antonio Membrado also takes part in many Festivals: Strasbourg, Lille, Troyes, Bern, Avignon, Saint-Tropez, Carcassonne, etc… and delivers several master-classes e.g. at Les Arcs, Evian and Carcassonne.
Antonio Membrado gradually withdraws from public stage (his last concert dated July 4, 1991 at the World Congress of Quantum Chemistry at the Palace of Europe). He then devotes himself to a more intimistic approach of music and also composes works for one or two guitars on poems or texts from Guillevic, Tagore, Jankelevich, Cioran, Rückert...
In 1995, a compilation album comprising 3 CDs of his major pieces recorded on LPs is published (currently sold out, but most titles can be listened to online at his website).

Ballyglass

Ballyglass () is a small village in central County Mayo in Ireland. It is situated about 10 miles from Castlebar, and closer to Claremorris and Ballinrobe. The population of Ballyglass is estimated at 240 people.
Infrastructure.
It consists of one shops, two pubs, a primary school, a playschool, a community center, a tennis court, a soccer pitch with a flood-lit training pitch, a soccer team ), a post office and a Garda barracks. Ballyglass recently received street lighting and a bottle and clothes banks. There is also a part-time dispensary. This was once a weekly service but it is now restricted to a monthly one. The Old Ground, now a public house, was originally built as a warehouse. A Court House was situated where Murphy's guest house is today.
[http://towns.mayo-ireland.ie/webx?14@@.2cb64172]
Education.
The new playschool began construction when the Minister of State for Children, Barry Andrews, visited Ballyglass on 5 December, where he turned the sod for the new Childcare Facility. The new building will be built at the rear of the Mountpleasant National School, and will greatly enhance the Childcare Services in the area. Mountpleasant National School was built in 1888 and was the Community Centre, but was vacated in 1986.

Jefferson-Chalmers Historic Business District

The Jefferson-Chalmers Historic Business District is a historic district located on East Jefferson Avenue between Eastlawn Street and Alter Road in Detroit, Michigan. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.
Nomenclature.
The Jefferson East neighborhood of Detroit is bounded by Alter Road on the east, St. Jean Street on the west, Charlevoix Street on the north, and the Detroit River on the south. Jefferson Avenue runs approximately through the center of the Jefferson East neighborhood, and is primarily commercial in nature for thirteen blocks from Dickerson Street to Alter Road. This section of Jefferson Avenue is also known as the Jefferson East Business District. Historically significant structures exist along Jefferson Avenue for eight blocks from Conner to Alter Road; this section of the Jefferson East Business District is designated as the Jefferson-Chalmers Historic Business District.
History.
The Historic Jefferson-Chalmers Business District is one of a few early twentieth-century neighborhood commercial districts that still survive in Detroit. During the 1920s, this district along Jefferson was the center of the east-side neighborhood's commercial, social, and cultural life. The district is unique in that two big-band era ballrooms, the cultural fulcrums of the early 20th century social scene, still exist within the district: the Monticello and the Vanity Ballroom.
The district has recently seen a resurgence, with a Michigan Cool Cities grant, five million dollars worth of streetscape improvements, and rehabilitation of a number of anchor buildings in the district, such as the Platte Warehouse at Jefferson and Ashland and the Chalmers Building at Jefferson and Chalmers.
Cityscape.
The housing consists of bungalows and Arts and Crafts houses built in the early 20th Century. John Carlisle (Detroitblogger John) of the "Metro Times" said that the houses "still have beauty and character despite weathering over the years". Most blocks have many owner occupied houses and mowed lawns. There are some vacant lots alongside streets and some boarded-up foreclosed houses.

Neonatal acne

Neonatal acne (also known as "Acne infantum," "Acne neonatorum", and "Neonatal cephalic pustulosis" (not to be confused with "Benign cephalic histiocytosis")) is an acneiform eruption that occurs in newborns or infants, and is often seen on the nose and adjacent portions of the cheeks.
The main cause of this condition is not known, but it could be due to the increased sensitivity of the infant's sebaceous glands to maternal hormones during pregnancy which also leads to a variety of skin conditions in the newborn.Typically, it peaks at around 2 months and rarely needs treatment. Sometimes gels or ointments are given.

Socialist ideology of the Kuomintang

The former socialist ideology of the Kuomintang is a unique form of socialism and socialist thought developed in China during the Republican era. The Tongmenghui revolutionary organization led by Dr. Sun Yatsen was the first to promote socialist ideology in China.
Organizations.
The Tongmenghui and its successor, the Kuomintang party were the first to develop socialist ideology in China.
History.
One of the Three Principles of the People of the Kuomintang, Mínshēng, was defined as socialism by Dr. Sun Yatsen. He defined this principle by saying in his last days "it's socialism and it's communism". The concept may be understood as social welfare as well. Sun understood it as an industrial economy and equality of land holdings for the Chinese peasant farmers. Here he was influenced by the American thinker Henry George (see Georgism) and German thinker Karl Marx; the land value tax in Taiwan is a legacy thereof. He divided livelihood into four areas: food, clothing, housing, and transportation; and planned out how an ideal (Chinese) government can take care of these for its people.
The Kuomintang was referred to having a socialist ideology. "Equalization of land rights" was a clause included by Dr. Sun in the original Tongmenhui. The Kuomintang's revolutionary ideology in the 1920s incorporated unique Chinese Socialism as part of its ideology.
The Soviet Union trained Kuomintang revolutionaries in the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. In the West and in the Soviet Union, Chiang Kai-shek was known as the "Red General". Movie theaters in the Soviet Union showed newsreels and clips of Chiang, at Moscow Sun Yat-sen University Portraits of Chiang were hung on the walls, and in the Soviet May Day Parades that year, Chiang's portrait was to be carried along with the portraits of Karl Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and other socialist leaders.
The Kuomintang attempted to levy taxes upon merchants in Canton, and the merchants resisted by raising an army, the Merchant's volunteer corps. Dr. Sun initiated this anti-merchant policy, and Chiang Kai-shek enforced it, Chiang led his army of Whampoa Military Academy graduates to defeat the merchant's army. Chiang was assisted by Soviet advisors, who supplied him with weapons, while the merchants were supplied with weapons from the Western countries.
The Kuomintang were accused of leading a "Red Revolution"in Canton. The merchants were conservative and reactionary, and their Volunteer Corp leader Chen Lianbao was a prominent comprador trader.
The merchants were supported by the foreign, western Imperialists such as the British, who led an international flotilla to support them against Dr. Sun. Chiang seized the western supplied weapons from the merchants, and battled against them. A Kuomintang General executed several merchants, and the Kuomintang formed a Soviet inspired Revolutionary Committee. The British Communist party congratulated Dr. Sun for his war against foreign imperialists and capitalists.
Even after Chiang turned on the Soviet Union and massacred the Communists, he still continued anti-merchant activities, and promoting revolutionary thought, accusing the merchants of being reactionaries and counterrevolutionaries.
The United States consulate and other westerners in Shanghai was concerned about the approach of "Red General" Chiang, as his army was seizing control in the Northern Expedition. 
Chiang also crushed and dominated the merchants of Shanghai in 1927, seizing loans from them, with the threats of death or exile. Rich merchants, industrialists, and entrepreneurs were arrested by Chiang, who accused them of being "counterrevolutionary", and Chiang held them until they gave money to the Kuomintang. Chiang arrests targeted rich millionaiares, accusing them of Communism and Counterrevolutionary activities. Chiang also enforced an anti-Japanese boycott, sending his agents to sack the shops of those who sold Japanese made items, fining them. Chiang also disregarded the Internationally protected International Settlement, putting cages on its borders, threatening to have the merchants placed in there. He terrorized the merchant community. The Kuomintang's alliance with the Green Gang allowed it to ignore the borders of the foreign concessions.
In 1948, the Kuomintang again attacked the merchants of Shanghai, Chiang Kaishek sent his son Chiang Ching-kuo to restore economic order. Ching-kuo copied Soviet methods, which he learned during his stay there, to start a social revolution by attacking middle class merchants. He also enforced low prices on all goods to raise support from the Proletariat.
As riots broke out and savings were ruined, bankrupting shopowners, Ching-kuo began to attack the wealthy, seizing assets and placing them under arrest. The son of the gangster Du Yuesheng was arrested by him. Ching-kuo ordered Kuomintang agents ro raid the Yangtze Development Corporation's warehouses, which was privately owned by H.H. Kung and his family. H.H. Kung's wife was Soong Ai-ling, the sister of Soong May-ling who was Ching-kuo's stepmother. H.H. Kung's son David was arrested, the Kung's responded by blackmailing the Chiang's, threatening to release information about them, eventually he was freed after negotiations, and Ching-kuo resigned, ending the terror on the Shanghainese merchants.
The Kuomintang Muslim Governor of Qinghai, General Ma Bufang was described as a socialist by American journalist John Roderick.
An American scholar and government advisor, Doak Barnett, praised Ma Bufang's government as "one of the most efficient in China, and one of the most energetic. While most of China is bogged down, almost inevitably, by Civil War, Chinghai is attempting to carry our small-scale, but nevertheless ambitious, development and reconstruction schemes on its own initiative"
General Ma started a state run and controlled industralization project, directly creating educational, medical, agricultural, and sanitation projects, run or assisted by the state. The state provided money for food and uniforms in all schools, state run or private. Roads and a theater were constructed. The state controlled all the press, no freedom was allowed for independent journalists. His regime was dictatoral in its political system. Barnett admitted that the regime had "sterm authoritarianism" and "little room for personal freedom".
Ideology.
The Kuomintang also promotes government-owned corporations. The Kuomintang founder Sun Yat-sen, was heavily influenced by the economic ideas of Henry George, who believed that the rents extracted from natural monopolies or the usage of land belonged to the public. Dr. Sun argued for Georgism and emphasized the importance of a mixed economy, which he termed "The Principle of Minsheng" in his Three Principles of the People.
"The railroads, public utilities, canals, and forests should be nationalized, and all income from the land and mines should be in the hands of the State. With this money in hand, the State can therefore finance the social welfare programs."
The Kuomintang Muslim Governor of Ningxia, Ma Hongkui promoted state owned monopoly companies. His government had a company, Fu Ning Company, which had a monopoly over commercial and industry in Ningxia.
The Chinese Muslim 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) governed southern Xinjiang from 1934-1937. The General Ma Hushan was chief of the 36th Division. The Chinese Muslims operated state-owned carpet factories.
Corporations such as CSBC Corporation, Taiwan, CPC Corporation, Taiwan and Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation are owned by the state in the Republic of China.
The Kuomintang government under Dr. Sun and Chiang denounced feudalism as counterrevolutionary. They proudly proclaimed themselves to be revolutionary. Chiang called the warlords feudalists, and called for feudalism and counterrevolutionaries to be stamped out by the Kuomintang. Chiang showed extreme rage when he was called a warlord, because of its negative, feudal connotations. 
A fascist paramilitary organization within the Kuomintang modeled after Mussolini's blackshirts, was anti-foreign and anti-communist, and stated that its agenda was to expel foreign (Japanese and Western) Imperialists from China, crush communism, and eliminate feudalism. In addition to being anti-Communist, some Kuomintang members, like Chiang Kai-shek's right hand man Dai Li were anti-American, and they wanted to expel American influence.
Marxists also existed in the Kuomintang party. They viewed the Chinese revolution in different terms than the Communists, claiming that China already went past its feudal stage and in a stagnation period rather than in another mode of production. These Marxists in the Kuomintang did not always agree the Chinese communist party ideology.
Implementation.
Chiang Kai-shek.
Contrary to the view that Chiang was pro-capitalist, Chiang Kai-shek behaved in an antagonist manner to the capitalists of Shanghai, often attacking them and confiscating their capital and assets for the use of the government, even while he was fighting the communists.
Chiang crushed pro-communist worker and peasant organizations, and the rich Shanghai capitalists, at the same time. Chiang continued Dr. Sun Yixian's anti-capitalist ideology; Kuomintang media openly attacked the capitalists and capitalism, demanding government-controlled industry instead.
Chiang blocked the capitalists from gaining any political power or voice in his regime. Once Chiang Kai-shek was done with his original rampage and "reign of terror", on pro-communist laborers, he proceeded to turn on the capitalists. Gangster connections allowed Chiang to attack them in the International Settlement, to force capitalists to back him up with their assets for his military expenditures.
Support.
Revolutionary and socialist leader Vladimir Lenin praised Dr. Sun Yatsen and the Kuomintang for their ideology and principles. Lenin praised Dr. Sun, his attempts on social reformation and congratulated him for fighting foreign Imperialism. Dr. Sun also returned the praise, calling him a "great man", and sent his congratulations on the revolution in Russia.
Influenced.
The Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang, the Vietnamese Kuomintang, was based on the Chinese Kuomintang party and one part of its ideology was socialism.
Constitution of the Republic of China.
The Three Principles of the People are officially the ideology of the Republic of China, as stated in the Constitution of the Republic of China. Mínshēng, defined as socialism, is one of these principles.

John Prideaux Lightfoot

John Prideaux Lightfoot, D.D. (23 March 1803 – 23 March 1887) was an English clergyman who served as the Rector of Exeter College, Oxford from 18 March 1854 until his death and as Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University from 1862 to 1866. He was the President of the Oxford Architectural Society (later the Oxfordshire Architectural and Historical Society) from November 1854 to November 1855.
John Prideaux Lightfoot was born 23 March 1803 at Crediton, Devon, England. He was the eldest son of Nicholas Lightfoot (1772–1847) and his wife Bridget Prideaux. Lightfoot married Elizabeth Ann Le Blanc on 15 July 1835 at St Luke's Church, Chelsea; they had eight children. His first wife died 31 November 1860 at Oxford, aged 50. He was married a second time on 7 January 1863 to Louisa, only daughter of Sir George Best Robinson, Bt., widow of Capt. C. R. G. Douglas, B.N.I. They had one daughter.
Lightfoot succeeded Joseph Loscombe Richards as Rector of Exeter, or head of the college, while Sir George Gilbert Scott's proposal for a new chapel inspired by the Sainte Chapelle in Paris was under consideration. The building programme during Lightfoot's tenure also included the Gothic revival library of 1856 and new Rector's lodgings in the Georgian style (1857). In 1886, Lightfoot commissioned the Adoration of the Magi tapestry from Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris, both alumni of Exeter, to be hung in the chapel. The completed tapestry was presented to the College in 1890, three years after Prideaux's death at the Rectory at Exeter on 23 March 1887.

Port Victoria P.V.7

The Port Victoria P.V.7 Grain Kitten was a prototype British Fighter aircraft of the First World War designed and built by the Port Victoria Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot on the Isle of Grain. A very small and light biplane intended to fly off platforms on Royal Navy Destroyers, it was unsuccessful, only a single prototype being built.
Design and development.
Following Royal Navy experience in operating land planes from platforms on ships, in late 1916, the British Admiralty came up with the idea of a lightweight fighter aircraft, capable of flying off short platforms on the forecastle of Destroyers in order to provide large numbers of aircraft at sea capable of intercepting and destroying German Airships. It therefore instructed the Marine Aircraft Experimental Department at Port Victoria on the Isle of Grain, and the RNAS Experimental Flight at Eastchurch to each produce a design to meet this requirement.
The Port Victoria aircraft, designed by W.H. Sayers, was designated P.V.7. It was a very small single bay tractor biplane, of "sesquiplane" configuration, with its lower wing much smaller than its upper wing. The wings featured the same high-lift section as used in previous Port Victoria aircraft, and were fitted with ailerons only on the upper wing. It was intended, as was the competing Eastchurch design, to use a 45 hp (34 kW) geared ABC Gnat two-cylinder air-cooled engine. Armament was a single Lewis gun mounted above the upper wing.
While the Port Victoria design was designed and built, the commander of the Experimental flight as Eastchurch, Harry Busteed took over command of the Port Victoria Marine Aircraft Experimental Department, taking the designer of the Eastchurch competitor and the part built prototype with him to the Isle of Grain, with the Eastchurch design gaining the Port Victoria designation P.V.8. The P.V.7 acquired the name Grain Kitten to distinguish it from the P.V.8, which was named the Eastchurch Kitten.
The P.V.7 first flew on 22 June 1917, powered by a 35 hp (26 kW) ungeared Gnat engine, as the geared engine was unavailable. The P.V.7 proved to be tail heavy in the air and difficult to handle on the ground, with its sesquiplane layout and high lift wings being considered unsuitable for such a small aircraft. The Gnat engine proved to be extremely unreliable, with test flights being forced to remain within gliding distance of an airfield.
When the P.V.8 first flew in September, it proved superior, although similarly hamstrung by the 35 hp Gnat. The P.V.7 was rebuilt with new wings of conventional aerofoil section, a modified tail and a new undercarriage to eliminate some of the problems found in testing. The low power and unreliability of the Gnat, however, prevented either aircraft being suitable for the intended use, and the P.V.7 was not flown after it was rebuilt.

Name.com

Name.com is an ICANN accredited domain name registrar and web hosting company.
History.
Name.com was founded in 2003, by Bill Mushkin. Mushkin bought the company Spot Domain LLC (Domainsite.com) in 2002. 
There are multiple registrars NAME.COM LLC uses for reselling: domainsite.com, name.com, name.net, sunmounta.in, alohanic.com, briarwoodtechnologies.com, domainregservices.com. 
On January 7, 2013, it was announced that Name.com was acquired by Demand Media. According to 10K reports from Demand Media the company paid $18 million to acquire Name.com.
Services.
Name.com offers more than 50 gTLD and ccTLD extensions and an aftermarket domain brokerage. Customers have over one million domain names registered with the company.
Name supports two factor authentication.
Domain tasting allegation.
In 2007, Name.com was accused of trademark infringement by Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. The companies declared the domain registrars Name.com and Spot Domain had registered over 40 domains of various misspellings, such as NeimanMarco.com and BerdgorfGoodman.com. These domains failed to show accurate contact information or provided false details. In the complaint, which was filed in March 2007, in the US District Court in Denver, the high-end retailers sought damages of at least $100,000 per name.
Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman claimed that the registrars were taking advantage of their special status with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), to secure misspelled domains during the five-day grace period, and paying only for the ones with valuable revenue. This practice, called domain tasting, resulted in cybersquatting on various trademarked names. Neiman Marcus had accused the registrar Dotster in 2006 of the same infringement. Mushkin, however, denied the accusations of "domain tasting," explaining that Name.com and Spot Domain were merely registrars, caught in the crossfire. He also argued that "the industry is young," and the issues were not clear-cut. In the settlement, there were several stipulations imposed on the companies Name.com and Spot Domain. Mushkin declined to specify the agreement that was reached.
DNS Hijacking.
Reports of DNS hijacking by Name.com have appeared on the Internet as early as 2010. The registrar will never return a NXDOMAIN status for DNS queries, and instead directs users to an advertising site they operate. When faced with criticism over this practice, the company points to clause of their Domain Registration agreement that relates to "parked domain names".
Philanthropy.
Their website features an assortment of causes supported by Name.com. The company has supported a range of non-profits, including a small literary magazine in South Africa, Amazwi, and a well-known local organization, Environment Colorado. Many of the charities featured are small, grassroots efforts, though Susan G. Komen and Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) are listed as well.
Apart from the listed donations, Name.com has been involved in several other charitable efforts. The company has a bike-to-work incentive program which involves payback for a new bicycle. Though the project appears to be at a standstill, Name.com worked briefly on a system of maps for laptop.org, and offered to guide interns in their Denver office. In April, 2008, Name.com went to London for the Webby’s People’s Voice Awards, sponsored by The Public Interest Registry, the registry behind the .ORG extension. Name.com sponsored Idealist.org at the event, which featured a panel of non-profits, including Greenpeace and Wikipedia.

IDS Scheer

IDS Scheer develops, markets, and supports Business Process Management (BPM) software and is widely regarded as the founder of the BPM industry. The company was established in 1984 by current supervisory board chairman and Chief Technology Advisor, August-Wilhelm Scheer as a spin-off from the Institute for Information Systems. Based on Dr. Scheer’s early Y-Model, developed in the 1980s, IDS Scheer’s ARIS product and related consulting services is the heart of the company’s technology and revenue. In 2009 it was acquired by Software AG.
IDS Scheer has a dominant BPM market-share in Europe and is considered well-positioned in the US market based on its partnerships with Microsoft, SAP, HP, Oracle, IBM and TIBCO as well as consistent financial success and numerous favorable reports from Gartner, Forrester, and AMR Research. However, the company is less well known in the US market, warranting some in the US to call IDS Scheer a “better kept secret.” 
The company holds the unique distinction of being embedded in the products of SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft. End-user markets for IDS Scheer include consumer packaged goods, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, papers, metals, retail and textile industries.
History.
IDS Scheer was founded in 1984 to market the Y-Model reference framework developed by Dr. Scheer in the 1980s. The Y-Model helped users identify and classify processes and was originally the foundation of IDS Scheer’s products. A special “Y” symbol is still in the company’s logo today as a representation of the Y-Model.
The company went IPO on the Frankfurt exchange in 1999. By the end of its first year as a public company, IDS Scheer had 87.1 million euro in annual revenue and had developed and sold the ARIS architecture it’s known for today. The company grew rapidly from 87.1 to 220 million euro in revenue from 1999 to 2003 and up to nearly 400 million euro by 2008. IDS Scheer acquired German-Swiss consulting firm Balink in 2004 and Russian consultancy Business Logic in January 2005.
The company continues to fuel an aggressive expansion today, including the opening of offices in Australia, Croatia, and Shanghai from 2004-2007. By 2007, the company had almost 3,000 employees, over half of which were devoted solely to consulting.
Software AG agreed to buy IDS Scheer for €487 million in July 2009. The takeover was cleared by competition authorities in October 2009.
Technology.
The Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS) is a broad framework covering the strategy, design, implementation and control of business processes. The framework was based on the work of IDS Scheer founder Dr. Scheer in the 1990s and is fundamental to the company’s ARIS platform. The ARIS framework is a generic, well-documented, methodology for business process modeling and lifecycle management.
The ARIS platform is an integrated portfolio of software intended to facilitate the improvement of business methodologies on an ongoing basis. It’s sold in four platform categories; the ARIS Strategy, Design, Implementation, and Controlling. ARIS is used to describe IDS Scheer’s suite of products, as well as the ARIS framework and ARIS Value Engineering methodology.
Name.
The firm was originally called “IDS Prof. Scheer Gesellschaft für integrierte Datenverarbeitungssysteme mbH”, was then shortened to "IDS Scheer". IDS stands for Integrated Data-processing Systems.
The current (2012) name ist "IDS Scheer Consulting GmbH".

Experimental Model 2 submachine gun

The was a submachine gun of Japanese origin chambered in the 8mm Nambu round and was issued to Japanese Naval units.
The machine gun was produced in relatively small numbers for the IJA during the invasion of Shanghai. During its trial periods it was found that the 8mm round which it used had a tendency to jam the weapon further restricting its use by both the Imperial Marines and army. After adopting several changes to the body a much smaller and lighter variant was introduced, christened the "bull pup" by American G.I.'s who encountered it in combat as it was so rare. It had a 50 round cartridge magazine extending from the pistol grip, a unique feature which would not resurface in sub machine gun design for nearly fifteen years predating the Sa vz. 23 and IMI Uzi.
The other sub-machine gun used by the Japanese military, the Type 100, was much more numerous. It was also used by the Imperial Army as well as the Navy. The Type 100 was the only finalized sub-machine gun used by the Japanese although it was more cumbersome than the Model 2.

Henry Hatch

W. Henry Hatch (June 13, 1900 – April 4, 1964) was the equipment manager for the University of Michigan varsity sports programs for 43 years from 1921 to 1964. For many years, he lived with his wife and daughter in a house on the grounds of Michigan Stadium and was considered a legendary figure in Michigan sports history. The Hatch-Falk Award is named in his honor, and he was posthumously inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1992. Hatch is responsible for the tradition of retiring Michigan Wolverines football jerseys and is part of the lore of the Little Brown Jug.
Michigan's equipment manager for 45 years.
Hatch was hired as Michigan's equipment manager under legendary coach Fielding H. Yost. He held the position for 45 years until his death in 1964. He served under seven head football coaches, including Yost, Harry Kipke, Fritz Crisler and Bennie Oosterbaan. In its obituary on Hatch, the Associated Press described him as follows: "A stocky, white-haired man, Hatch was familiar to thousands of Michigan football fans as the man scampering on and off the stadium gridiron on game errands."
During his time as Michigan's equipment manager, Hatch became a legendary figure on campus. He worked out of the equipment room at Yost Arena and lived with his wife and daughter in a house on the grounds of Michigan Stadium. In a book by Jim Brandstatter published in 2002 about the stadium's history, Hatch's daughter recalled calling Michigan Stadium home 1952-1964. The house was located just outside the stadium walls but inside the fence at the south end of the stadium. Even though the football team played games there only seven or eight days a year, Hatch and his family lived on the stadium grounds 365 days a year. They watched over the stadium at night and were responsible for locking and unlocking the gates each day.
Hatch was reportedly beloved by Michigan athletes. All-American Albert Wistert told a story about Hatch's kindness to him. Wistert's older brothers, Francis "Whitey" and Alvin, had also played for Michigan, and had been All-Americans wearing the No. 11 jersey. The youngest Wistert said he never asked for the No. 11 jersey, but Hatch had saved it for him. When Wistert picked up his uniform in 1940, Hatch reached under the counter and pulled out the No. 11 jersey. Wistert later recalled, "I never needed a pep talk after that. Every time I put on that jersey, that was all I needed."
Hatch and the tradition of retiring jerseys.
Hatch also began the tradition of retiring jersey numbers at Michigan. The first jersey Hatch retired was the No. 47 jersey worn by Bennie Oosterbaan. After Oosterbaan graduated in the 1920s, Hatch said, "Nobody's ever going to make All-American three years running again. I'm not going to give Bennie's number out." As Tom Harmon finished his playing career at Michigan, Hatch decided Harmon's No. 98 jersey would join Oosterbaan's as the second to be retired. One newspaper reported: "Ol' 98 will be folded carefully and laid away to rest in the Michigan Niche of Fame. That is the decree announced by Henry Hatch, Ann Arbor equipment manager." And when Harmon completed his final game, the United Press reported: "The book was closed on number 98 today, and Equipment Manager Henry Hatch of Michigan university put it reverently away in a musty trunk beside number 47." The other of the four original retired numbers (see main image above) are No. 87, which belongs to Ron Kramer and No. 11, which belongs to the Wistert brothers.
Little Brown Jug.
As Michigan's equipment manager, Hatch played a role in the early history of the Little Brown Jug, one of the most famous trophies in college athletics. In 1903, the Michigan Wolverines traveled to , where the unbeaten Wolverines played the unbeaten Minnesota Golden Gophers. At the end of the game (a 6-6 tie), the crowd poured onto the field, and Michigan left its earthenware water jug on the field. Michigan asked to have it returned, but Minnesota refused, saying Michigan would have to win the jug back. Michigan reclaimed the jug several years later. In 1919, Minnesota beat Michigan on the Wolverines' home field in Ann Arbor. When Minnesota asked for the symbolic trophy at the end of the game, Michigan officials said they could not locate it. Eventually, Hatch came up with it. Hatch recalled, "When Minnesota made such a fuss about getting it back, I started looking around and found it behind a clump of shrubbery near the gym. I shined it up and shipped it on to Doc Cooke." Minnesota fans have long doubted Hatch's story, raising their suspicions that Hatch did not find the jug in a clump of shrubbery, but more likely "in a trophy case inside the gymnasium, easily dusted off and proudly brought back to Minnesota."
In the decades that followed, one of Hatch's jobs was to serve as the custodian of the jug during the time it was in Ann Arbor and to print each year's game score on the side of the jug. In 1953, the NEA wire service distributed a photograph of Hatch placing the score on the jug on the 50th anniversary of the first Little Brown Jug match.
Death and honors.
Hatch died at his Ann Arbor, Michigan home in April 1964 of a heart attack, the day after being released from the hospital for surgery on an intestinal ailment. He was survived by his wife, Wanda, and his daughter, Patricia Ann.
In 1993, Hatch was posthumously inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. As a further tribute to Hatch, the University of Michigan Club of Greater Detroit presents the "Hatch-Falk Award" each year to the university's senior manager. The award is named after Henry Hatch and his successor, Jon Falk, and provides a full tuition grant to the current Senior Manager. The Award refers to Hatch as the "legendary Equipment Manager in the early years of Michigan Athletics." Hatch was awarded an honorary varsity letter from the M Club (as W. Henry Hatch) for outstanding service to the Athletic Department.

Princess Xenia Andreevna of Russia

Princess Xenia Andreevna Romanoff (10 March 1919 – 22 October 2000) was a direct descendant of the Tsars of Russia. She was a great niece of Nicholas II, the last reigning Russian Emperor.
Biography.
Princess Xenia was born in Paris, on 10 March 1919. She was the eldest child of Prince Andrei Alexandrovich of Russia (24 January 1897 – 8 May 1981) and Donna Elisabetha Ruffo (1886–1940). Xenia Andreevna descended twice over from the Tsars of Russia.
Her paternal grandfather, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, was the fourth son of Grand Duke Michael, himself the fourth son of Tsar Nicholas I. Her paternal grandmother, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, was the eldest daughter of Tsar Alexander III and sister to Tsar Nicholas II.
Xenias’s father - the Tsar's nephew - Prince Andrew Romanoff had in 1918 married Elisaveta Fabrizievna, daughter of Don Fabrizio Ruffo, "Duca" di Sasso-Ruffo. During the Russian Revolution Princess Xenia’s parents took refuge in the Crimea where they married. They escaped Russia in December 1918. Xenia’s mother was already pregnant with her when they left Russian soil.
Princess Xenia had two brothers: Michael and Andrew. Her mother died of cancer during World War II. Her father remarried and Xenia had one half sister, Princess Olga Andreevna Romanoff.
Princess Xenia, called "Mysh" in the family, was educated privately and spent much of her childhood in the household of her grandmother Grand Duchess Xenia at Frogmore Cottage, a grace-and-favour house in Windsor Great Park provided by King George V. She also spent some of her early years in London. After King George V's death in 1936, they moved with their grandmother to Wilderness House, another house in the royal gift, at Hampton Court.
Xenia and her siblings had an English nanny, but Russian was spoken at home.
In 1938 She received ballet lessons at the school of Russian Ballet
During World War II, Princess Xenia Romanov worked as a nurse at Great Ormond Street Hospital and later worked as a volunteer with the Russian Benevolent Society for Refugees. She was first married in London on 17 June 1945 to 2nd Lieutenat Calhoun Ancrum from South Carolina (b.Philippines 28 April 1915-21 Februar 1990); an American airman whose father was a colonel in the US Marine Corps. Cal Ancrum was serving abroad with the US Army when they met.
Initially, they lived in England, then in Germany for a time before moving to the United States. They divorced in 1954. She then met Geoffrey Tooth, head of the Mental Health section at the Ministry of Health and a member of the Expert Advisory Panel at the World Health Organisation. They married on 7 April 1958 in Tehran. During the 1970s Xenia and Geoffrey Tooth (b. 1 September 1908) settled at Rouffignac, in the Dordogne, France. Geoffrey Tooth died in 1998.

Wendy and Bonnie

Wendy and Bonnie Flower were an American singing sister duo, who recorded the album, "Genesis", in 1969 for Skye Records.
The album was produced by Gary McFarland. At the time, McFarland was part owner of the Skye label, along with Latin percussionist Cal Tjader (who was Wendy and Bonnie's godfather) and jazz guitarist Gábor Szabó.
Wendy and Bonnie grew up in Millbrae, California, in the San Francisco Bay suburbs. Their parents, Art and Jeane Flower, were professional musicians. In 1967, Wendy played and recorded with an early San Francisco psychedelic band called Crystal Fountain; Bonnie later joined the band as drummer. The following year, Tjader heard some of the Flower sisters' acoustic home demos and arranged a recording session with Skye. The sisters, who were teens at the time the album was recorded, composed all the songs. McFarland served as arranger on the sessions, crafting a post-psychedelic soft rock sound with Brazilian overtones. Musicians who performed on the album included guitarist Larry Carlton, drummer Jim Keltner, and keyboardist Mike Melvoin.
The Skye label went bankrupt shortly after the album's release. In 1971, while planning for additional recording with the Flower sisters, McFarland was murdered in mysterious circumstances in a New York bar.
In the early 1970s, Wendy and Bonnie provided background vocals on two Cal Tjader albums for Fantasy Records. Thereafter, the sisters pursued separate careers in music and entertainment, but did not record together again.
"Genesis" was reissued on CD in 2001 by the Sundazed Records label. In 2008, it was reissued in expanded format, including demos, alternate mixes, and vintage live recordings, on 2-CD and 3-LP vinyl sets.
Their recording "By the Sea" was sampled by the Welsh space rock band Super Furry Animals on a single "Hello Sunshine," which is also the opening track on the band's 2003 album "Phantom Power". In 2010, French singer Laetitia Sadier of UK group Stereolab recorded "By the Sea" for release on her album, "The Trip". 
After singing guest harmony with Super Furry Animals at San Francisco's The Fillmore, New York's The Tonic and London's ICA, Wendy Flower performed (backed by Jane Weaver and The High Llamas) as one of the Lost Ladies of Folk at the 2007, Jarvis Cocker-curated Meltdown Festival. She sang on Weaver's "Fallen By Watchbird" album and, in 2013, released her own indie-pop album, "New."

Kyaukmyaung (Sagaing)

Kyaukmyaung is a town in Sagaing Division, Myanmar. It is situated 46 miles north of Mandalay on the west bank of the River Irrawaddy, and 17 miles east of Shwebo by road. It marks the end of the third defile of the Irrawaddy.
Pottery and ceramics.
Kyaukmyaung is famous for the manufacture of large glazed earthernware pots known as "Martaban jars", established when 5,000 Mon war captives were settled in the area by King Alaungpaya (1752–1760) after his conquest of Pegu. Earlier the Peguans from the south had rebelled and deposed the King of Ava. Aung Zeya (later Alaungpaya), chief of Moksobo (later Shwebo), led his countrymen in a revolt against the Mon, and collected a fleet at Kyaukmyaung where he defeated the advancing Mon.
The glazed pots were also called "Ali Baba jars" and transported down the river on bamboo rafts. The biggest of these jars can hold as much as two hogsheads of liquor or about 105 gallons (over 400 litres) of water or food, mainly fish paste or "ngapi", fish sauce or "nganpyayei", and peanut oil.
Second World War.
When the Japanese invaded Burma in 1942, the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company was ordered to scuttle their rivercraft at both Mandalay and Kyaukmyaung by the retreating British colonial government. The river, about half a mile wide at this point, was crossed and bridgeheads established in January 1944 by the 19th Infantry Division (India) at both Kyaukmyaung and Thabeikkyin, when the Allied forces counter-attacked.
Irrawaddy dolphins.
A 2004 survey of the Irrawaddy dolphin counted 18 to 20 between Kyaukmyaung and Mingun, and in December 2005 the Department of Fisheries designated the 72 km stretch of the Irrawaddy between these two points a protected area for the dolphins.

Childrens Hospital

Childrens Hospital is a satirical American comedy television series and web series that lampoons the medical drama genre, created by and starring actor/comedian Rob Corddry. The series began on the web on TheWB.com with ten episodes, roughly five minutes in length, all of which premiered on December 8, 2008. Adult Swim picked up the rights to the show in 2009 and began airing episodes in 2010.
The storyline centers on the staff of Childrens Hospital, a children's hospital named after Dr. Arthur Childrens. The hospital sporadically (and usually without reason) is mentioned as being located within Brazil, despite making virtually no effort to conceal that the series is shot in Los Angeles, California. Corddry is part of an ensemble cast portraying the hospital's doctors, which also includes Lake Bell, Erinn Hayes, Rob Huebel, Ken Marino and Megan Mullally. Malin Åkerman and Henry Winkler joined the cast for season two. Previously recurring Zandy Hartig and Brian Huskey were upped to series regulars in season five.
In 2012 and 2013, the series won a Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Special Class – Short-format Live-Action Entertainment Program.
Synopsis.
Childrens Hospital is a product of TheWB.com. Its webisodes are about 4–5 minutes long, each narrated by mainly Dr. Cat Black (Lake Bell) in Season 1, and by Dr Valerie Flame (Malin Åkerman) in Season 2. The show mocks such medical dramas as "St. Elsewhere", "House", "Grey's Anatomy", "General Hospital", "Private Practice", "Chicago Hope", "ER", and "Scrubs".
Broadcasting.
Though Comedy Central made a competing offer, the show was picked up by Adult Swim after Corddry decided the comedy style was not suited for the half-hour format Comedy Central wanted. Adult Swim offered half-hour or fifteen minute time slots, and Corddry chose the latter. The original season one webisodes began airing on Adult Swim on July 11, 2010, in groups of two with a new faux-commercial in between the groupings of two webisodes. The channel then debuted the newly produced season two episodes which began airing on August 22, 2010.
On September 1, 2010 "Childrens Hospital" began airing on the Canadian television channel G4. In Winter 2013, the show began airing on MuchMusic In Australia "Childrens Hospital" premiered on cable on Comedy Channel on January 26, 2011, and on the ABC's free-to-air channel ABC2 during May–June 2013.
Cast and characters.
The series revolves around the medical staff of Childrens Hospital, featuring an ensemble cast. Within the series, "Childrens Hospital" is a television medical drama, with the real-life actors portraying the actors on the show-within-a-show. For example, Rob Corddry portrays Cutter Spindell, the actor who plays Dr. Blake Downs.
These actors receive top billing in the credits:
Production.
During the first three seasons, portions of the show were filmed in North Hollywood Medical Center, the same former hospital used for filming "Scrubs" and several other movies and television programs. As a parody of the live episode "Ambush" of "ER", the season two finale (aired November 7, 2010) was promoted as a live broadcast.
Related projects.
The mock television advertisements presented with the Adult Swim broadcasts of "Childrens Hospital" season one would tie into future Adult Swim programs, with a series pickup of crime procedural parody "" ("National Terrorism Strike Force: San Diego: Sport Utility Vehicle") reported in November 2010, and Chris Elliott starring in "Eagleheart", which premiered in February 2011. The fictional health drink Nutricai was prominently featured in the "Eagleheart" episode "Double Your Displeasure."
In June 2011, Rob Corddry revealed that "Newsreaders", the fictional news magazine featured in the world of "Childrens Hospital", was picked up for development into its own program. In May 2012, Adult Swim announced "Newsreaders" as part of its series programming for the 2012–13 broadcast season, with former "The Daily Show" co-executive producer Jim Margolis serving as showrunner, developing "Newsreaders" with creators Wain, Corddry, and Jonathan Stern. The show premiered January 17, 2013.
Corddry has stated that the cast and creative team of "Childrens Hospital" are working on doing a movie together, separate from "Childrens Hospital", with a different story and characters.
Ratings.
Despite the low ratings compared to other cable television series, Childrens Hospital still has received its highest ratings to date on its new midnight (Eastern Time) slot. On Friday, it pulled in 525,000 viewers while Sunday yielded 551,000 (in the 18–34 demographic). Since then, it has once hit the 900,000 mark. Since the start of the third season, the show has been pulling in over 1 million viewers per episode.

<doc id="20671792" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20671792" title="Appenzell Wars">
Appenzell Wars

The Appenzell Wars () were a series of conflicts that lasted from 1401 until 1429 in the Appenzell region of Switzerland. The wars were a successful uprising of cooperative groups, such as the farmers of Appenzell or the craftsmen of the city of St. Gallen, against the traditional medieval power structure represented by the House of Habsburg and the Prince-Abbot of the Abbey of St. Gall.
Background.
Appenzell, the name in means "cell (i.e. estate) of the abbot," had been under the personal control of the abbot of St. Gall. While the Prince-Abbot appointed agents or bailiffs, the communities in Appenzell were governed by a council appointed by the "Landsgemeinde", in which every citizen could vote. The success of the Swiss Confederation, with similar "Landsgemeinden", against the aristocratic Habsburgs encouraged the Appenzell citizens to consider throwing off the Abbot's agents. By about 1360, conflicts over grazing rights, taxes, and tithes were causing concern for both parties. Both the abbot and the farmers of Appenzell wanted to protect their rights and interests by joining the new Swabian League. In 1377 Appenzell was allowed to join the League with the support of the cities of Konstanz and St. Gallen (the city of St. Gallen was often at odds with the neighboring Abbey of St. Gall). With the support of League, Appenzell refused to pay many of the gifts and tithes that the Abbot Kuno von Stoffeln demanded. In response to the loss of revenue from his estates, Kuno approached the Austrian House of Habsburg for help. In 1392 he made an agreement with the Habsburgs, which was renewed in 1402. In response, in 1401 Appenzell entered into an alliance with the city of St. Gallen to protect their rights and freedom.
Outbreak of the war.
Following increasing conflicts between the Appenzellers the abbot's agents, including the bailiff of Appenzell demanding that a dead body be dug up because he wanted the man's clothes, the Appenzellers planned an uprising. On a certain day, throughout the abbot's lands, they attacked the bailiffs and drove them out of the land. Following unsuccessful negotiations Appenzell and St. Gallen entered into a treaty. The treaty between St. Gallen and Appenzell marked a break between the abbot and his estates. Perhaps fearing the Habsburgs, in 1402 the League expelled Appenzell. During the same year, St. Gallen reached an agreement with the abbot and Appenzell could no longer count on St. Gallen's support. Appenzell declared itself ready to stand against the abbot, and in 1403 formed an alliance with the Canton of Schwyz, a member of the Old Swiss Confederation that had defeated the Austrians in the last century. Glarus provided less support, but authorized any citizen who wished to support Appenzell to do so. In response, the League raised an army and marched to St. Gallen before heading toward Appenzell. In May 1403, the abbot's and the League's troops marched toward Trogen. On 15 May 1403, they entered the pass to Speicher and outside the village of Vögelinsegg met the Appenzell army. A small force of about 80 Appenzellers started the attack from a hill over the valley, with about 300 soldiers from Schwyz and 200 from Glarus moving around the flanks of the army. When the League's cavalry charged up the hill, they met 2000 Appenzellers and were forced to retreat. During the retreat, about 600 horsemen and many of the 5000 infantry were killed by the Appenzell army. The League signed a peace treaty with Appenzell at Arbon, but the peace was short lived.
Independence for Appenzell.
Along with independence, in the peace treaty Appenzell gained some of the abbot's land in the Rhine valley and around Lake Constance, which angered the abbot. Additionally, over the next two years, the city of St. Gallen and Appenzell drew closer. By 1405 the abbot had found another ally and was ready to retake his land. Frederick IV, Duke of Austria provided the abbot with two Austrian armies to attack Appenzell. 
On 17 June 1405, the main army marched into Stoss Pass on the border of Appenzell and there met the Appenzell army. Following a brutal battle, the Austrian army was forced to retreat. The story that the Austrians retreated when they saw a second Appenzeller army, which was actually the women of Appenzell who had come to help their husbands and brothers, only appears in later sources and is not considered accurate.
Following the Appenzell victory at Stoss Pass, they formed an alliance with the city of St. Gallen, which was known as the "Bund ob dem See" (alliance over the sea, which refers to the nearby Lake Constance). The creation of the "Bund" shook the foundation of Austrian power in the Lake Constance region. By 1406 they had taken more than 60 castles and destroyed 30. During the expansion, Appenzell had even captured the abbot of St Gall and in response they were excommunicated by the Bishop of Constance. 
However, while the "Bund" expanded the Austrians used the peace to regain their strength. On September 11, 1406 an association of nobles formed a knightly order known as the "Sankt Jörgenschild" (Order of St. George's Shield) to oppose the rebellious commoners of the "Bund". The order besieged the "Bund" city of Bregenz in 1407. On January 13, 1408 "Bund" troops marched against the Order and Austrian troops outside the city. The attack was a disaster for the "Bund", when their troops were defeated and driven back from the walls. Following the defeat Appenzell was unable to hold the "Bund" together. The city of St. Gallen and the Canton of Schwyz each paid off the Austrians to avoid an attack, and the "Bund" was dissolved by King Rupert on April 4, 1408.
As part of the peace treaty, the abbot gave up his ownership of Appenzell, but was still owned certain taxes. However, it wasn't until 1410 that the area was at peace. 
In 1411 Appenzell signed a defensive treaty with the entire Swiss Confederation (except Bern), which strengthened their position against the abbot. Appenzell joined the Confederation as an "Associate Member", and wouldn't become a full member until 1513. In the following years, Appenzell refused to pay the taxes that they owed the abbot. In 1421 the Confederation supported the abbot again Appenzell over the matter of these taxes, and an imperial ban was declared to try to force them to pay. When this was unsuccessful, in 1426 they were placed under an interdict and an army was sent into Appenzell to force them to pay. Friedrich VII of Toggenburg supported by the Order of St. George's Shield marched into Appenzell. On 2 December 1428 they encountered and defeated the Appenzell army behind a heavy fortification (known as a Letzi) on the field between Gossau and Herisau. Following the battle, in 1429 Appenzell was forced to repay the owed taxes but was granted freedom from the obligations in the future. This treaty represented the end of Appenzell's last financial tie to the Abbey of St. Gall, and a movement to closer relationships with the Confederation.

Open-system environment (OSE) reference model (RM) or "OSE reference model" (OSE/RM) is a 1990 reference models for enterprise architecture. It provides a framework for describing open system concepts and defining a lexicon of terms, that can be agreed upon generally by all interested parties. 
This reference model is meant as environment model, complementary to the POSIX architecture for open systems. It offers an extensible framework that allows services, interfaces, protocols, and supporting data formats to be defined in terms of nonproprietary specifications that evolve through open (public), consensus-based forums. This reference model served in the 1990s as basic building block of several technical reference models and technical architecture.
In 1996 this reference model was standardized in the ISO/IEC TR 14252 titled "Information technology -- Guide to the POSIX Open System Environment (OSE)".
History.
The development of the open-system environment reference model started early 1990s by the NIST as refinement of the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) standard. POSIX is a standard for maintaining compatibility between operating systems, and addresses interoperation for communications, computing, and entertainment infrastructure. It's developed started late 1980s by the POSIX Working Group 1003.0 of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). 
The NIST hosted workshops and conducts other support activities to assist users in addressing open systems requirements, preparing for the use of new technology, and identifying the international, national, industry and other open specifications that are available for building open systems frameworks, such as the government's applications portability profile for the open-system environment. 
NIST sponsors the semiannual Users' Forum on Application Portability Profile (APP) and Open System Environment (OSE) to exchange information and respond to NIST proposals regarding the evaluation and adoption of an integrated set of standards to support the APP and OSE. The quarterly Open Systems Environment Implementors' Workshop (OIW), co-sponsored by NIST and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Computer Society, provides a public international technical forum for the timely development of implementation agreements based on emerging OSE standards.
OSE/RM topics.
The open-system environment (OSE) forms an extensible framework that allows services, interfaces, protocols, and supporting data formats to be defined in terms of nonproprietary specifications that evolve through open (public), consensus-based forums. A selected suite of specifications that defines these interfaces, services, protocols, and data formats for a particular class or domain of applications is called a profile. 
Two types of elements are used in the model: entities consisting of the application software, application platform, and platform external environment; and interfaces including the application program interface and external environment interface.
APP service areas.
The Application Portability Profile (APP) is an OSE profile designed for use by the U.S. Government. It covers a broad range of application software domains of interest to many Federal agencies, but it does not include every domain within the U.S. Government’s application inventory. The individual standards and specifications in the APP define data formats, interfaces, protocols, or a mix of these elements.
The services defined in the APP tend to fall into broad service areas . These service areas are:
Each service area is defined in the following sections. The figure illustrates where each of these services areas relates to the OSE/RM. Assume that software engineering services are applicable in all areas. Each of the APP service areas addresses specific components around which interface, data format, or protocol specifications have been or will be defined. Security and management services are common to all of the
service areas and pervade these areas in one or more forms.
Classes of interfaces.
There are two classes of interfaces in the OSE reference model: the application program interface and the external environment interface: 
OSE profile.
A profile consists of a selected list of standards and other specifications that define a complement of services made available to applications in a specific domain. Examples of domains might include a workstation environment, an embedded process control environment, a distributed environment, a transaction processing environment, or an office automation environment, to name a few. Each of these environments has a different cross-section of service requirements that can be specified independently from the others. Each service, however, is defined in a standard form across all environments.
An OSE profile is composed of a selected list of open (public), consensus-based standards and specifications that define services in the OSE/RM. Restricting a profile to a specific domain or group of domains that are of interest to an individual organization results in the definition of an organizational profile.
OSE reference model entities.
The three classes of OSE reference model entities are described as follows: 
Types of information transfer services.
There are three types of information transfer services. These are transfer services to and from: 
In its simplest form, the OSE/RM illustrates a straightforward user-supplier relationship: the application software is the user of services and the application platform/ external environment entities are the suppliers. The API and EEI define the services that are provided. 
Applications.
Basically, the open-system environment model is a basic building block of several technical reference models and technical architecture. A technical architecture identifies and describes the types of applications, platforms, and external entities; their interfaces; and their services; as well as the context within which the entities interoperate.
A technical architecture is based on:
The technical architecture is the basis for selecting and implementing the infrastructure to establish the target architecture. 
A technical reference model can be defined as a taxonomy of services arranged according to a conceptual model, such as the Open System Environment model. The enumerated services are specific to those needed to support the technology computing style (e.g., distributed object computing) and the industry/business application needs (e.g., Human Services, financial).

Frank Brett Noyes

Frank Brett Noyes (July 7, 1863 - December 1, 1948) was president of the Washington Evening Star, and a founder of the Associated Press. He was a son of Crosby Stuart Noyes.
Biography.
Noyes was born in Washington DC on July 7, 1863. He attended
public schools in Washington and later went to the preparatory school
of Columbian College (which later became 
George Washington University), but did not complete a degree. Instead, in 1881 he began to work in the "Evening Star"'s business department full-time, though he had already worked for the "Star" in his spare time during his high school and college years. 
He was manager and treasurer for the "Star" from 1887 to 1901. From 1901 to 1910 he lived in Chicago and edited the "Chicago Recorder-Herald" while remaining a director of the "Evening Star", and moved back to Washington in 1910 to become president of the Evening Star Newspaper Company.
Beginning in 1893, Noyes became involved with the formation of the Associated Press and was elected its president in 1900, retiring only in 1938.
He married Janet Thurston Newbold on September 17, 1888. They had four
children: Crosby (died in infancy), 
Frances Newbold Noyes, Newbold Noyes Sr., and Ethel.

Church of El Salvador, Toledo

The Iglesia de El Salvador is a church in Toledo, Spain, dating to 1041 or possibly earlier. 
It initially was a mosque and it is therefore oriented south-east, in the direction of Mecca. It survived the conquest of Toledo by Christian armies in 1085, to be turned into a church in 1159. One of the most characteristic elements of the church is a Visigothic pilaster, with intricate relief carvings.

One Day of Life

One Day of Life () is a novel by Salvadoran author Manlio Argueta. The novel is set in Chalatenango, El Salvador and follows the daily life of Guadalupe Guardado and the women of her family just prior to the Salvadoran Civil War. The book was banned by the government of El Salvador after its 1980 release for its descriptions of human rights violations by the Organización Democrática Nacionalista, the government's paramilitary intelligence organization.
Argueta spent over 20 years exiled in Costa Rica following arrests for his involvement in political activity against the government. "One Day of Life" was published in 1980, the year of the beginning of the Salvadoran Civil War.
"One Day of Life" was nominated by Modern Library as the fifth-best Latin American book of the 20th century. The conservative, pro-government Salvadoran newspaper "El Diario de Hoy" expressed doubt in the nomination. Other critics expressed disapproval of Argueta's novel being selected higher than popular writers like Ernesto Sabato and Alejo Carpentier.
Plot summary.
Guadalupe "Lupe" Guardado is a middle-aged Salvadoran woman who lives near Chalatenango, El Salvador. During the day she is required to do what she can to support her family, while her husband works for a wealthy landowner. Her husband José has become involved in rebellion against the economic conditions and became a leader in the Christian farmers organization. Fearing persecution for his opposition, José regularly stays "in the hills" after work and sees his family little. The Guardado's son Justino was killed by the "authorities" prior to the events in the novel, and their son-in-law Helio has "disappeared." Guadalupe's granddaughter Adolfina relays the protest at a cathedral, as well as a massacre of students on a bus. At the end of the novel, the authorities bring a beaten man to Guadalupe and Adolfina who had said the name "Adolfina" after being severely beaten. Adolfina does not recognize the man, but Guadalupe recognizes her husband José. On his previous advice, she denies knowing him, and he is taken away.

List of people who have walked across the United States

Walking or running across the United States has long been a challenge, especially to bring publicity to some social cause. The definition has been going from coast to coast, not counting the Gulf of Mexico. 
William and Constance Stockdale and their dog, Taj Mahal.
In 1949, for his honeymoon, he and his wife and boxer dog "Taj Mahal" walked "across America afoot," 3525 miles from Putnam, CT to Los Angeles, CA from Sept. 1949 to March 1950. Bill and Connie as they were known were some of the first known people to ever attempt this. This adventure was the start of a long and fulfilling career as a travel lecturer and writer for Bill. He and his wife visited over 65 countries on six different continents. He shared his love of travel through writing, television, and lectures. He wrote many articles for the Travel Section of the New York Times, the Boston Globe, and the Worcester Telegram. He died on September 14, 2009 at age 91, leave his wife of 60 years.

Michael Ross and George Crawford.
On April 21, 2013, Michael Ross, 18, and George Crawford, 19, began their journey from Danbury, CT and set out to walk to Huntington Beach, CA. The purpose of their walk was to raise money for the Livestrong Foundation. They chose this cause because of their own family members who were affected by cancer. Michael and George used Facebook under the page Livestrong Across America to raise money and connect with people throughout their trip. They also temporarily had a blog on their own website, Walking for a Cure 2013 to update their followers on their travels. After walking roughly 3,600 miles through New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Arizona, and California, Michael and George reached Huntington Beach, CA on February 10, 2014. As of February 17, 2014 they raised $11,401 towards their cause.

He walked 3,152 miles in 88 days, averaging a 40–45 miles daily, and kept a daily blog at Steptoofar.com. Film of the journey is currently being edited and photos of the trip will be compiled into a photo book. Beeby's walk raised money for Tag Rugby Trust, a UK rugby charity that helps young kids in developing countries. Jon's crew included: Nigel Usher, Helen Haris, Ali Kerslake, Michael Field, Shaun Stander, and Chris Saunders.
Greg Benner.
Greg Benner walked across America the first time between April 26, 2001 beginning in Aberdeen, WA, proceeded east to Charleston, SC, and ended in front of the White House July 4, 2002. He walked 3,883 miles and was featured in newspapers, on radio, and on national TV.
Greg walked across America a second time October 20, 2010 beginning at the Santa Monica pier near Los Angeles, CA and walked to Jacksonville, FL where he ended on Hannah Beach at 7:18 pm September 28, 2011. Greg covered 2,720 miles on this route. He cold-called more than a 1,000 churches of all denominations, sat with nearly 500 pastors from untold denominations, and spoke many times. As a result of his walks Greg wrote a book entitled "Author unknown" (ISBN 9781619967465) released March 30, 2012 which is on Amazon.com. His book encompasses more than 40 years of His life, and other travels to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel, Germany, Dubai, England, and the United States, which led him into the offices of foreign dignitaries.
He intends to walk across America a third time in 2013 to 2014 on a northern route to navigate the remaining states. Meanwhile, Greg will be making an 8500 mile book tour in 2012 for "Author unknown" that heads him eastward from Washington State through Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, into Washington, DC before turning south toward Jacksonville, FL. Once Greg reaches Jacksonville, he will head westward through Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Oregon, back into Washington State.

Mycle Brandy, 59 years old and a 4 time stroke survivor from San Clemente, CA, walked from Newport Beach, CA to Washington DC leaving on 14 February 2010, going through CA, AZ, NM, TX, OK, MO, IL, KY, IN, OH, WV, MD, VA, DC. He walked to raise awareness of the early warning signs of stroke and warn against a sedentary lifestyle visiting stroke units at local hospitals and talking with stroke survivors. He delivered his message through television, radio, newspapers and personal appearances and has raised more than $10,000 for the American Heart Association.
During Mycle Brandy's Walk Across America he was able to deliver his message of hope to more than 50 million people through various media sources. Upon finishing his Walk Across America, Mycle received a Letter of Congratulations from President and First Lady Obama. On July 17, 2011, Mycle Brandy began a second segment of his Walk Across America, walking from San Diego, CA to Seattle WA and finished on November 23, 2011 receiving a Letter of Congratulations from Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn. 
Mycle began his 3rd walk at the age of 61 on October 1, 2012 from Madawaska Maine to Miami Florida. He walked through: Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. He completed the walk on his 62nd birthday, February 14, 2013 at the Miami City Hall exactly 3 years after beginning his initial Walk Across America. The Miami City Council presented Mycle with a "Proclamation" proclaiming February 14, 2013, M2M & Mycle Brandy Day.

Joseph Casamassima.
Joe Casamassima, a musician and former teacher, at age 27 walked from Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania to San Francisco, California, crossing 10 states in three months (June 17, 2007–September 16, 2007), to raise money and awareness for Multiple Sclerosis. Casamassima is currently 29 and a graduate student at Harvard University.
Philip Cihiwsky.
Phil Cihiwsky, 59, walked from San Diego, California to York Harbor, Maine. He walked 3300 miles unsupported, crossing 15 states in 7 months (March 4 - October 4, 2013) while raising awareness about senior food insecurity issues for Meals On Wheels and encouraging people he met along the way to support home delivered meal programs in their own communities .
Daniel Brooks Chapin.
In January 2010, Daniel Chapin a youth advocate and activist from Orange County, California walked from California to Tennessee and onto Washington D.C. after a brief month of rest in Nashville, Tennessee. The walk was organized to promote community solidarity and to raise awareness for the importance of unified faith based youth programs throughout the nation. Chapin who also served as a youth pastor and marriage counselor in California, was motivated by his interactions with young people in his then current hometown, Garden Grove, Calif saying,"Young people are looking for a sense and longing and community," he said. "They're not finding it, especially in churches. They're finding division and doctrinal differences." Chapin's journey visited the heartland of America and along the route he was hosted at a variety of venues who share similar goals of inter-community solidarity and exchange, such as the "Roadrunner Hostel" in Tucson, Arizona and "All the King's Horses Children's Ranch" in Benson, Arizona speaking at churches, city halls and the like. Chapin performed the walk without a cell phone or support vehicles. Instead, he relied on teams of individuals and those encountered along the way to aide in travel arrangements, host homes, etc. Chapin is currently working on a book to be released in the summer of 2011 on the journey. Chapin is currently the founder and lead pastor for the International Coalition For Youth Of Christ and regularly speaks to youth about his encounters and lessons from the journey. In 2011, Chapin walked around the perimeter of Hawaii for youth outreach programs; being the only individual who has both crossed the mainland USA and circled the entire perimeter of Hawaii
Jared Michael Choate.
On September 1, 2010, Jared Choate embarked upon the arduous 3,171 mile journey from Surf City, New Jersey to Santa Monica, California to complete his lifelong goal of running across the United States. He had no preconceived route, no team helping him to safety, and rarely a roof over his head. He merely had a cart full of supplies, a few dollars in the bank and the ambition to move from ocean to ocean. Through his travels Choate relied heavily on the goodwill of strangers for directions, a small patch of grass to sleep, and at times a helping hand with his cart's innumerable flat tires and shortcomings. In the beginning half of his journey, Choate was married in Chicago, IL to Kelly S. Anderson taking a short three week sabbatical from the excursion. When the honeymoon was over, Choate reconvened with his cart and began running again. The newlyweds stayed connected through cell phone, email and skype communication and often working out details of the route together day to day. Choate finished his final steps on February 13, 2011 on the Santa Monica Pier. The first chapter of his e-book The Now Testament is due to release on July 11, 2013 and the following chapters will be released episodically. In addition, Choate will promote his e-book while biking across the United States in the "Bike I Mean Book Tour" set to begin August 1, 2013.
Geo. Tyler Coulson and his dog, Mabel.
In March 2011, 32-year-old Chicago attorney Geo. Tyler Coulson left his corporate law job at the law firm Sidley Austin in Chicago to walk across the United States with his dog, Mabel. Coulson and Mabel left Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on March 11, 2011, and finished in San Diego, California, on November 8, 2011. Although Coulson began his hike on the American Discovery Trail, weather and time constraints forced him to adopt a shorter route. Along the way, Coulson and Mabel encountered numerous thunderstorms, tornados, and a record heat wave across Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska. Coulson had temporary car support in western Nebraska, and again from Koosharem, Utah, to Temecula, California. Coulson's hike is the subject of the book By Men or By the Earth. Coulson writes about cross-country hiking at www.tylercoulson.com.
Justin Cousart and Mike Molloy.
In March 2012, Justin Cousart and Mike Molloy trekked from Los Angeles, California to Saint Augustine, Florida. Allegedly on a dare, the two men began the journey on March 4. They made the trip in 104 days, spending a considerable amount of time in Las Vegas, Nevada where they garnered much support from gamblers and showgirls. The purpose of their trip was to raise awareness and recruit members for the American Homebrewers Association. While many news reporters wanted to interview Cousart and Molloy about their journey, the two declined all publicity. They worried that too much publicity would take away from the trip's purpose. Upon finishing the journey, Cousart and Molloy threw a massive afterparty in their college town of Saint Augustine, Florida.
Nate Damm.
Nate Damm from Maine began walking from Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware to San Francisco, California on February 26, 2011, and finished October 15th, 2011.
James DiGiovanni.
James DiGiovanni walked from the Atlantic Ocean at Coney Island in his hometown of New York City to the Pacific Ocean at Pacific Beach in San Diego. He left on May 12, 2012 and reached the pacific ocean 154 days later on October 12, 2012. Leaving all but a cart of supplies behind, he is relied on the kindness of strangers to make his way across America and experience all it has to offer. Supporters created a website, James Is Walking, with links to a map with GPS tracking and a Facebook page in which he writes about his trip.
Nick Della Valle.
50 year old Christian evangelist, Nick Della Valle, has walked across America (3300 miles) three different times since 2001. Being a "small" man, standing just 4'8" tall, he dressed like the Biblical character Zacchaeus, looking like a shepherd with a staff at his side. He spoke at many churches and schools during his journey of several months. Christ Walk
Helga Estby.
Helga Estby, a 36-year-old from Spokane, Washington, and her 18-year-old daughter Clara walked from Spokane to New York City in 1896, setting off on May 5, 1896, passing through 14 states along the way, and arriving at the latter on Christmas Eve. She did so in response to a $10,000 challenge from a sponsor given to any woman who would walk across the United States. She brought with her a compass, red-pepper spray, a revolver, and a curling iron. She wanted the money in order to save her family's farm. She did not receive it.
Rory Fanning.
Rory Fanning, age 34, of Chicago, IL walked from Virginia Beach, VA to San Diego, CA in 2008-2009 in honor of Pat Tillman. Fanning served in the 2nd Ranger Battalion with Tillman. The idea was to raise the $3.6 million Tillman gave up when he left the NFL to join the military. The money was donated to the Pat Tillman Foundation. He spent 8 months, walking across the U.S., speaking to schools, prisons, and corporations. He stopped 42 steps from the Pacific Ocean, symbolic of Tillman's jersey number, technically "not walking across the country for Pat," as he said in his final blog entry. He walked in 23 hours while in New Mexico.
Louis Michael Figueroa.
Louis Michael Figueroa, age 43, of Tucson, AZ is arguably the most prolific transcontinental journeyman. In 1982, at the age of 16, Figueroa became the fastest and youngest person to run across the United States covering the route from New Brunswick, NJ to San Francisco in 60 days to fulfill a promise to a friend who was dying of bone cancer.
In 1996–1997 he walked from Bangor, ME to San Diego, CA for local AIDS networks in memory of his brother Jimmy, who died of the disease. The walk was plagued by delays due to Figueroa's battle with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia.
In 2005, he began a walk around the United States for victims of child abuse. Figueroa walked for six months and covered of the .
On June 4, 2010 Figueroa left from where he previously stopped, west of Somerset, PA and is currently finishing his trek around the United States. He plans to arrive in Tucson sometime in late December.
Stephan Foust.
From January, 1979 to September, 1980, former teacher Stephan Foust, age 30, of South Bend, IN walked 3607 miles from Nags Head, NC to Point Reyes, CA. His journey took him through the states of North Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and California. While on the road, Foust searched for stories and hosted a live remote weekly radio show via telephone on WSBT-AM in South Bend. Following a lengthy career in television news, video production, and mass communication consultation, Foust is now the Director of the Center for Innovation in Media at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro.
Steve Fugate.
Steve Fugate of Florida was inspired to walk across the United States following the 1999 suicide of his son, Stevie. Since then, he has walked over through the 48 contiguous United States, passed through more than 2,000 communities and worn out 43 pairs of shoes, crossing the United States 6 times and walking both coasts twice each, while carrying a large sign that states, "LOVE LIFE."
Phil Goddard.
Phil Goddard, a 48-year-old freelance translator from London, England, walked 3,091 miles from New York, NY to Los Angeles, CA, starting on June 17, 2006 and finishing on May 6, 2007. He did this in memory of his wife Jayne, who died of colon cancer aged 49, and raised $84,000 for the Association for International Cancer Research.
A.J. Goodrich and Mark Metivier.
A.J. Goodrich, a 27-year-old documentary filmmaker, walked from Venice Beach, CA to New York City, with a small crew, including Mark Metivier, John Conway, Satinder Kaur, Leonora Anzaldua Burke, Michael Cox, Matthew Chester and Andres Pacheco. They started on February 1, 2011 and ended on August 20, 2011, taking 201 days (including rest days). They covered approximately , going south through New Orleans and the Bible Belt and up the East Coast. They walked in shifts, living and working out of an RV that would drive ahead while they walked.

Saint Leo of Catania

Saint Leo of Catania, nicknamed the "Thaumaturgus" (May 709 – 20 February 789) was the fifteenth bishop of Catania, famed also for his love and care toward the poor. His feast day occurs on February 20, the day of his death in which he is venerated as a Saint both by Roman Catholics and by the Orthodox Church. He lived in the lapse of time between the reigns of the Emperors Justinian II and Constantine IV. He struggled especially against the paganism and sorcery still prevalent in the Byzantine Sicily.
He left the memory of prodigies and charitable deeds, an admirable apostolate that deserved him his Greek epithet. For the natives of Catania he was simply "Leone " il Maraviglioso"" (the "Wonderworker" or "He who performs Miracles").
Catania dedicated to him a peripheral suburb built around the homonymous Catholic Parish but even the name of the sole Eastern Orthodox church of the city, harboured in a temple that still maintains
the primal name of "Saint Michael the Lesser", restored recently and consecrated again to the purpose.
He is, moreover, the patron saint of the Sicilian localities of Rometta, Longi and Sinagra. The hamlet of Saracena in Calabria celebrates him twice a year in Spring and in late Summer.
Life.
Leo was born at Ravenna and very young he became a Benedictine, then he moved and betook himself to Reggio Calabria in Southern Italy where the local bishop Cyril nominated him archdeacon. Thereat he stayed till his episcopal election for the vacant Diocese of Catania.
A local legend asserts that the Catanians, who needed a new Bishop, had a collective dream wherein an Angel suggested them to search for the selected person in the Calabrian city of Reggio where a man in odour of sanctity lived in an hermitage. That stranger would have become the right guide to fill suchlike post. At first Leo was reluctant as he considered himself not worthy for this ordeal so he did not accept and decided to refute politely such summary acclaim. Afterwards, when the umpteen solicitations from Catania became doubtless and heartfelt, he persuaded at last. In fact on 765 he was appointed to rule over that Community of Christians.
In the coming epoch, in every regions of the Byzantine Empire (of whom Catania with the entire Sicily was a dominion) began the fierce and unrestrainable destruction of the sacred icons, the so-called "iconoclasm", which Leo openly opposed to.
Owing to his firmness, the Byzantine Governor of Sicily ordered his arrest, forcing him to leave Catania and find refuge on the Tyrrhenian territories of the island. He wandered for many years through the woody Nebrodian heights, in the whereabouts between Longi and Sinagra, protected by the people that recognized him as a fervent opposer of the Imperial power.
He reached, during this long peregrination a place called Rometta. Here, on the Monti Peloritani backing Messina, he lived in a cave he hollowed out all by himself with his very hands and fingernails. Shortly after, when his persecution seemed to calm down he was able to come back to Catania where he repossessed his bishopric to keep on fighting with more strength than ever against the iconoclast laws and the new and growing gurgles of heresy.
He died in Catania on 20 February 789.
A Catanian legend: the Thaumaturge and the Charmer.
According to a local account, among the candidates who were excluded from being vested with the episcopate, there was a character called Heliodorus. Catanian dignitary of noble birth, he probably denied his Christian belief because of envy and rage for a choice so sudden and unexplainable to him, bearing a malice towards the foreign-born nominee and his fellow-citizens.
For this reason, he began devoting himself to the occult and magic with the sole aim to grow into Leo's worst adversary and noisome disturber to fascinate and lead astray with any sort of wizardries his occasional spectators in order to acquire easily compliant followers.
On the other hand, Leo always tried peacefully to convince Heliodorus that his behavior and deviltries were thoroughly wrong.But in vain. They met each other for the last time on 778 AD and their final clash will have a large echo throughout Sicily, to rebound even to the Imperial court of Constantinople.
During a Mass officiated by the Saint Prelate in the whilom mother-church of Catania, Heliodorus noisily rushed into the nave, slinking away along the pews to spellbind and confound the believers engrossed in the Sunday rite. In further versions of the same tale, many story-tellers want him to clamour inside the temple in the likeness of a black elephant or with the retinue of a trumpeting pachyderm.
Leo was constrained to conclude the Liturgy and determined on ending those roaring witcheries he drew away from the altar and forced his way through the parishioners to face that "demonic jester". Deranged by sorrow, he drew the conclusion that all his mild approaches and patient argumentations would have not been efficient any more. So, he decided to dare that impious enchanter to show publicly and prove baldly he who professed the rightest creed.
After ordering to heap up wood for a pyre in a furnace inside the close Achillean Thermal Baths, Leo suddenly enwrapped his omophorion round the abashed miscreant dragging him towards the chosen place where the balefire was already crackling. Both were immediately enfolded by highest flames that transformed their lineations and clothes in embers.
Only Leo will survive to this test of faith.He came out of the stake with undamaged vestments that kept shining about his unscathed body.The other unwilling contestant was fated to succumb instead. The only traces of his funeral pile were, as a matter of fact, a mass of smoking and glittering ashes.

<doc id="20672010" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20672010" title="Orthosternarchus tamandua">
Orthosternarchus tamandua

Orthosternarchus tamandua is a species of weakly electric knifefish in the family Apteronotidae, native to the deep river channels of the Amazon River system. This species is characterized by its long tubular snout, long dorsal appendage, and tiny, bilaterally asymmetrical eyes.
Systematics.
"O. tamandua" was originally described as "Sternarchus tamandua" by George Albert Boulenger in 1880; its species name is from the Tupi word "tamanduá", meaning "anteater", in reference to its long snout. In 1905, Eigenmann and Ward placed this species in the genus "Sternarchorhamphus", though noting that it may represent a distinct taxon. In 1913, Ellis placed this species into its own genus "Orthosternarchus", from the Greek "orthos" ("straight"), "sternon" ("chest"), and "archos" ("rectum"), referring to the straight snout and the forward placement of the urogenital opening.
Ellis saw "O. tamandua" as a close relative to "Sternarchorhamphus", which has been corroborated by recent morphological and molecular analyses. The relationship between these two genera and the rest of the Apteronotidae is less clear, though they are generally regarded as basal within the family. Some authors consider them to be sister taxa to "Platyurosternarchus" and "Sternarchorhynchus", which also have elongate heads. However, in those taxa the elongation is accomplished by lengthening of the jaws, whereas in "Orthosternarchus" and "Sternarchorhamphus" it is accomplished by the lengthening of the head while the jaws remain relatively short. This suggests that elongate head shape was independently evolved between the two groups.
Distribution and habitat.
"O. tamandua" is a relatively rare species found in the Amazon River basin, and is most abundant in the Rio Negro and the Rio Purus. It inhabits both whitewater and blackwater rivers, usually occurring at depths of 6-10 m and occasionally shallower or deeper, but never beyond 20 m down. It is absent from floodplain channels, river edges, and small lakes. A few specimens are known from the confluence of the Rio Solimões and the Rio Negro, and from Lake Prato, Anavilhanas.
Description.
One of the gymnotiforms most specialized to living in deep river channels, "O. tamandua" resembles fishes adapted to caves in several respects. Their elongated, laterally compressed bodies are nearly unpigmented, appearing bright pink due to the blood underneath. The eyes are tiny and virtually non-functional, and are placed asymmetrically on the head. The asymmetry of the eyes is not correlated with size, sex or environment, but may be related to their degenerate state. The snout is distinctive, being a long, evenly tapering, nearly straight tube measuring four times as long as high. The mouth is relatively small. The dorsal throng (a whip-like appendage used for electroreception) is unusually long and thick, which led it to originally be described as a "very strongly developed adipose fin" by Boulenger. The throng originates close to the rear margin of the skull, which is much more anterior than in other apteronotids.
"O. tamandua" has a long anal fin, a small caudal fin, and tapering pectoral fins; the dorsal and pelvic fins are absent. The caudal fin shows a great deal of variation due to regeneration after tail loss; in some cases the regenerated fin becomes merged with the anal fin. The fin rays number 9 in the caudal fin, 14-15 in the pectoral fins, and 207-256 in the anal fin. Almost the entire body, except for the dorsal midline, is densely covered with flimsily attached scales, being small and circular towards the front and larger and more rectangular towards the back. There are around 12 rows of scales above the lateral line and 40-42 rows below. The first 5-10 scales along the lateral line are modified into overlapping elongate tubes. The maximum known size is 44 cm long and 125 g.
Biology and ecology.
As in other apteronotids, "O. tamandua" generates a continuous weak electric field for electrolocation and communication. At 452-605 Hz, the electric organ discharge (EOD) of "O. tamandua" has a much lower frequency than most other apteronotids and approaches the frequencies of the sternopygid knifefishes. The EOD is also unusual in that the waveform is monophasic, with a head-negative spike followed by a positive baseline (the EOD of most apteronotids have both positive and negative spikes). The only other apteronotid known to have a monophasic EOD is the related "Sternarchorhamphus muelleri". The monophasic waveform of these two genera is similar to the EOD of a larval "Apteronotus", suggesting that it may be a paedomorphic or evolutionarily ancestral trait.

Subiaco Creek

Subiaco Creek, a northern tributary of the Parramatta River, is a creek west of Sydney Harbour, located in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. 
Ecology.
The source of the creek is in the suburb of Ermington. The creek then flows westwards though Rydalmere before turning south for a short distance and draining into the Parramatta River. It is approximately long. 
The Ponds Creek is a tributary of Subiaco Creek, having its source in Dundas Valley and flowing though Dundas.
Origin of name.
Subiaco Creek is named after a convent and boarding school for girls, which was established in the area by Benedictine Nuns. They named the school 'Subiaco', after the Italian town of Subiaco in which Saint Benedict established his religious order.
The Ponds was the name given to a chain of freshwater ponds which formed the headwaters of The Ponds Creek. They were described in 1789 by Lieutenant-General Watkin Tench, who wrote "the Ponds, a name which I suppose it derived from several ponds of water".
History.
The area around Subiaco Creek and the Ponds was one of the earliest areas settled by European colonists in Australia, the first land grant in the area being made in 1791. This was the fourth land grant by Governor Phillip, the governor of the newly founded colony of New South Wales, and it was made to Phillip Schaeffer. He created a property called 'The Vineyard'. After a succession of owners the property was purchased by Hannibal Macarthur in 1813. Macarthur went on to build a mansion, called 'The Vineyard' in 1836. This was the mansion which became the Benedictine school, from which the name Subiaco was derived.
Geography.
To date the majority of Subiaco Creek has been spared from development, with much if its length contained within a network of reserves and parks. The art historian Bernard Smith recounts memories of picking "great bunches of wildflowers" along Subiaco Creek in his youth. Some sections of the creek near Cowells Lane Reserve have been placed in culverts and covered over.

Richard J. Sullivan

Richard Joseph Sullivan (born April 10, 1964) is a United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York.
Background and education.
Richard Sullivan was born in Manhasset, New York. He graduated from Chaminade High School in 1982 and earned a B.A. in Government and English at the College of William and Mary in 1986. He received his J.D. from the Yale Law School in 1990.
Professional career.
After law school, Sullivan worked as a law clerk to U.S. Circuit Judge David M. Ebel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and a litigation associate at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
From 1994 to 2005, Sullivan served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York, where he successfully prosecuted the Maisonet heroin organization, which sold approximately $100,000 worth of heroin per day in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx and carried out numerous murders in aid of its racketeering activity. Among those prosecuted in that case was Bronx defense attorney Pat Stiso, who acted as house counsel to the RICO enterprise. Other notable cases included the investigation and indictment of Mario Villanueva Madrid, who as governor of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo accepted millions of dollars from Mexican drug cartels in exchange for providing safe passage for ton quantities of cocaine en route to the United States. Madrid was eventually extradited to the United States, where he pled guilty to money laundering conspiracy.
In 2002, Sullivan became Chief of the newly created International Narcotics Trafficking Unit (INT), which was responsible for investigating and prosecuting the world's largest and most powerful narcotics organizations. Among the noteworthy defendants prosecuted by that Unit were Colombia kingpins Alberto Orlandez Gamboa, Diego Murillo Bejarano, and Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela; Afghan warlord Bashir Noorzai; Dutch ecstasy kingpin Henk Rommy; and the leadership of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
Sullivan was named Prosecutor of the Year by the Federal Law Enforcement Association in 1998 and was awarded the Henry L. Stimson Medal from the New York City Bar Association in 2003.
In 2005, Sullivan joined Marsh Inc., a global risk and insurances firm, as Deputy General Counsel for litigation. He was named General Counsel of Marsh Inc. in June 2006.
Judicial career.
On February 15, 2007, Sullivan was nominated by President George W. Bush to a seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by Judge Michael B. Mukasey, who had retired from the bench in September 2006. Sullivan was confirmed by the United States Senate in a vote of 99-0 on June 28, 2007, and received his commission on August 1, 2007. He was among the "Judges to Watch" named in the September 2012 issue of "The American Lawyer".
Sullivan sits on the executive board of the New York American Inn of Court and is an adjunct professor at Fordham University School of Law, where he teaches courses on white collar crime and trial advocacy, and Columbia Law School, where he teaches a course on sentencing. In December 2012, Sullivan participated in a musical revue hosted by the New York American Inn of Court on the topic of civility in the legal profession.

Electron-capture mass spectrometry

Electron-capture mass spectrometry (EC-MS) is a type of mass spectrometry that uses electron capture ionization (ECI) to form negative ions from chemical compounds with positive electron affinities. The approach is particularly effective for electrophiles. In contrast to electron ionization, EC-MS uses low energy electrons in a gas discharge. The technique can be used with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
Mechanism.
The attachment of a low energy electron can give rise to two possible reactions for the compound, as shown below. Either the compound attaches an electron to form a radical anion, 
or the compound fragments, resulting in electron capture dissociation (ECD). ECD forms an anion fragment and a radical fragment
Fragmentation in ECI has been studied by tandem mass spectrometry.

Arapawa goat

The Arapawa Goat is a breed of feral goat descended from Old English "milch" goats released on Arapawa Island off the coast of New Zealand. It is directly descended from a breed of English landrace goat which no longer exists in its native England. Extremely rare today, a few have been exported to North America and other regions.
These goats were originally put on Arapawa by the inhabitants of the bay named Te Awa Iti Whaling Station in the early 1800s. 
The Arapawa Goat is a delightful breed which happily settles down with other breeds of goat when kept in captivity. In 2004 six goats were brought from Arapawa Island to the UK to preserve the bloodline.
By the dedication of Betty Rowe the goats of Arapawa Island were preserved when the New Zealand Government wished to cull them entirely. Through direct action the goat still survives today but annually there is a cull. Many goats live in the Sanctuary set up on the island.
From the original six goats brought to the UK there are now herds being built up around the country. In 2009 the first Arapawa Goat doe was brought to Mid Wales and in 2010 the first Arapawa buck arrived. It is hoped that in 2011 the first Welsh Arapawa will be born.

He was a native of Tarentum, one of the earliest commentators on the writings of Hippocrates, and also one of the earliest of the Empiric school. He lived after Herophilus, Callimachus, Bacchius, and Glaucias; and apparently before Zeno; and his date may therefore be placed around the middle of the 3rd century BC.

<doc id="20672504" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20672504" title="Cicatricial alopecia">
Cicatricial alopecia

The term cicatricial alopecia refers to a diverse group of rare disorders that destroy the hair follicle, replace it with scar tissue, and cause permanent hair loss. A variety of distributions are possible. In some cases, hair loss is gradual, without symptoms, and is unnoticed for long periods. In other cases, hair loss is associated with severe itching, burning and pain and is rapidly progressive. The inflammation that destroys the follicle is below the skin surface and there is usually no "scar" seen on the scalp. Affected areas of the scalp may show little signs of inflammation, or have redness, scaling, increased or decreased pigmentation, pustules, or draining sinuses. Cicatricial alopecia occurs in otherwise healthy men and women of all ages and is seen worldwide.
Types of cicatricial alopecia.
Cicatricial alopecias are classified as primary or secondary. This discussion is confined to the primary cicatricial alopecias in which the hair follicle is the target of the destructive inflammatory process. In secondary cicatricial alopecias, destruction of the hair follicle is incidental to a non-follicle-directed process or external injury, such as severe infections, burns, radiation, tumors, or traction.
Primary cicatricial alopecias are further classified by the type of inflammatory cells that destroy the hair follicle during the active stage of the disease. The inflammation may predominantly involve lymphocytes or neutrophils. Cicatricial alopecias that predominantly involve lymphocytic inflammation include lichen planopilaris, frontal fibrosing alopecia, central centrifugal alopecia, and pseudopelade (Brocq). Cicatricial alopecias that are due to predominantly neutrophilic inflammation include folliculitis decalvans, tufted folliculitis, and Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp. Sometimes the inflammation shifts from a predominantly neutrophilic process to a lymphocytic process. A cicatricial alopecia with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate is folliculitis keloidalis.
Causes.
The cause of the various cicatricial alopecias is poorly understood. However, all cicatricial alopecias involve inflammation directed at the upper part of the hair follicle where the stem cells and sebaceous gland (oil gland) are located. If the stem cells and sebaceous gland are destroyed, there is then no possibility for regeneration of the hair follicle, and permanent hair loss results.
Cicatricial alopecias are not contagious. In general, cicatricial alopecias are not associated with other illnesses, and usually occur in otherwise healthy men and women.
Cicatricial alopecias affect both men and women, most commonly adults, although all ages may be affected. Epidemiologic studies have not been performed to determine the incidence of cicatricial alopecias. In general, they are not common.
The majority of patients with cicatricial alopecia have no family history of a similar condition. Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia is the one exception; it primarily affects women of African ancestry, and may occur in several women in the same family. While it is possible to have more than one type of hair loss condition, non-scarring forms of hair loss do not turn into scarring forms of hair loss.
Symptoms.
It is important to continue to watch for symptoms and signs of active disease during and after treatment to ensure that the disease is responding adequately and has not re-activated after therapy has been discontinued. Response to therapy may be indicated by the resolution of scalp symptoms such as itching, pain, tenderness, or burning, by improvement in the signs of scalp inflammation such as decreased redness, scaling or pustules, and by halting or slowing the progression of hair loss. A dermatologist can follow your cicatricial alopecia using these guidelines, and with the pull test. Photographs of the scalp may be useful in monitoring the course of the disease and response to treatment.
Diagnosis.
A scalp biopsy is essential for the diagnosis of cicatricial alopecia and is the necessary first step, as it can be hard to know the diagnosis for sure without a biopsy. Findings of the scalp biopsy, including the type of inflammation present, location and amount of inflammation, and other changes in the scalp, are necessary to diagnose the type of cicatricial alopecia, to determine the degree of activity, and to select appropriate therapy.
Clinical evaluation of the scalp is also important. Symptoms of itching, burning, pain, or tenderness usually signal ongoing activity. Signs of scalp inflammation include redness, scaling, and pustules. However, in some cases there are few symptoms or signs and only the scalp biopsy demonstrates the active inflammation. The overall extent and pattern of hair loss is noted and sometimes photographed for future comparison. A hair "pull test" is performed to see if growing, or "anagen", where hairs are pulled out easily. The pulled hairs are mounted on a slide and the hair bulbs are viewed with a light microscope to determine how many are growing hairs and how many are resting hairs. In addition, if pustules are present, cultures are taken to identify which microbes, if any, may be contributing to the inflammation. A thorough evaluation that includes all of these parameters is important in diagnosing a cicatricial alopecia and in identifying features in individual patients that will help the selection of therapy.
New diagnostic techniques, such as trichoscopy may be used for non-invasive differential diagnosis of cicatricial alopecia. 
Diagnosis and treatment of cicatricial alopecias is often challenging. For this reason, it is helpful to be evaluated by a dermatologist with a special interest or expertise in scalp and hair disorders, and who is familiar with current diagnostic methods and therapies.
Treatment.
As mentioned above, primary cicatricial alopecias are classified by the predominant type of inflammatory cells that attack the hair follicles: i.e., lymphocytes, neutrophils, or mixed inflammatory cells. Treatment strategies are different for each subtype and detailed treatment options are beyond the scope of this discussion. However, certain general principals are reviewed below.
Treatment of the lymphocytic group of cicatricial alopecias (including lichen planopilaris, frontal fibrosing alopecia, central centrifugal alopecia, and pseudopelade (Brocq) involves use of anti-inflammatory medications. The goal of treatment is to decrease or eliminate the lymphocytic inflammatory cells that are attacking and destroying the hair follicle. Oral medications may include hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, or corticosteroids. Topical medications may include corticosteroids, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, or Derma-Smoothe/FS scalp oil. Triamcinolone acetonide, a corticosteroid, may be injected into inflamed, symptomatic areas of the scalp.
Treatment of the neutrophilic group of cicatricial alopecias (folliculitis decalvans, tufted folliculitis) is directed at eliminating the predominant pathogenic microbes that are invariably involved in the inflammatory process. Oral antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy, and topical antibiotics may be used to supplement the oral antibiotics. In dissecting cellulitis, pathogenic microbes are not usually present. Isotretinoin in small doses may be helpful in treating dissecting cellulitis.
Treatment of the mixed group of cicatricial alopecias (folliculitis keloidalis) may include antimicrobials, isotretinoin, and anti-inflammatory medications.
You should discuss any treatment with your dermatologist, who will also explain potential side effects, as well as laboratory tests that are needed before starting treatment and sometimes are monitored during treatment.
The course of cicatricial alopecia is usually prolonged. Treatment is continued until the symptoms and signs of scalp inflammation are controlled, and progression of the condition has been slowed. In other words, itching, pain, tenderness, and burning have cleared, scalp redness, scaling, and/or pustules are no longer present, and the progression of the hair loss has been stopped or slowed. Treatment may then be stopped. Unfortunately, the cicatricial alopecias may reactivate after a quiet period and treatment may have to be repeated.
Surgical treatment for cosmetic benefit is an option in some cases after the disease has been inactive for one to two or more years. Hair restoration surgery or scalp reduction may be considered in these instances.
Hair Regrowth.
Hair will not regrow once the follicle is destroyed. However, it may be possible to treat the inflammation in and around surrounding follicles before they are destroyed, and for this reason it is important to begin treatment as early as possible to halt the inflammatory process. Minoxidil solution (2% or 5%) applied twice daily to the scalp may be helpful to stimulate any small, remaining, unscarred follicles. The progression of hair loss is unpredictable. In some cases, progression is slow and there is always sufficient hair remaining to cover the affected scalp areas; in other cases, progression can be rapid and extensive.
Hair Care.
Hair care products and shampoos can generally be used with any frequency desired, as long as the products are gentle and non-irritating to the scalp. Dermatologists may recommend specific shampoos and products to decrease scalp symptoms, scaling and inflammation. Hair pieces, wigs, hats, and scarves may be used freely.

Boulder River Wilderness

Boulder River Wilderness is a wilderness area within the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest in the western Cascade Range of Washington state.
Topography.
Boulder River Wilderness is made up of dense forests and steep ridges that rise to the summits of Three Fingers and Whitehorse Mountain. Elevations range from in the Boulder River Valley to the south peak of Three Fingers. South Peak is also home to an old fire lookout. This high ridge bears a narrow saw-toothed profile with several sharp summits, which include Liberty, Big Bear, and Whitehorse Mountains and Salish and Buckeye Peaks, all above in elevation. Several steep and heavily wooded ridges thrust out east and west from the central crest of the wilderness.
Boulder River, a tributary to the North Fork Stillaguamish River, is the wilderness area's primary drainage and runs approximately through the northwest section of the wilderness. The Long Creek Research Natural Area on the south slope of Wiley Ridge is also protected within the wilderness boundary.
Vegetation.
Common vegetation in Boulder River Wilderness includes old-growth Douglas fir, true fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar, as well as bigleaf maple, alder, willow, and devil's club. Sitka spruce can be found at the lowest elevations along the Boulder River. The Boulder River Wilderness contains some of the best virgin forest in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.
Wildlife.
Black bears, black-tailed deer, and elk inhabit the forest, and mountain goats can be found on the rocky shelves above the tree line.
Hiking.
Boulder River Wilderness boasts approximately of trails, though the central core of the area remains rough and trailless. A short trail extends up Boulder River for through old-growth forest. Three short trails climb toward the high crest and eventually peter out. Another trail crosses the northeast corner of the Wilderness over Squire Creek Pass, with outstanding views of the high crest.

Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia

Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, hot comb alopecia, or follicular degeneration syndrome is a type of alopecia first noticed in African Americans in the 1950s and reported by LoPresti et al. in 1968 as a result of application of petrolatum followed by a stove-heated iron comb. The original theory was that the hot petrolatum would travel down to the hair root, burn the follicle, and after repetitive injury scarring would result. Later CCCA was realized to affect men and women without a history significant for use of such styling techniques. Consequently, the terms "follicular degeneration syndrome" per Sperling and Sau in 1992 and then CCCA per Olsent et al. in 2003 were evolved. Plausible contributing factors may include other African-American styling techniques such as relaxers, tight braids, heavy extensions, certain oils, gels or pomades.
Terminology.
The terminology of CCCA has been a source of regular confusion. Recent clarifications have been made, with the term "central centrifugal cicatritial alopecia" adopted as a diagnostic category by the North American Hair Research Society. It has also been referred to as:
Also in this category is cicatricial pattern hair loss (CPHL). This CCCA pattern is a potential alopecia mimic that can be confused for androgenetic alopecia. Alopecia mimics have proven a problem in establishing diagnosis of alopecia when using only clinical evaluation.
A similarly sounding term is central centrifugal scarring alopecia (CCSA). (L.C. Sperling, Central, centrifugal scarring alopecia. In: L.C. Sperling, Editor, An atlas of hair pathology with clinical correlations, Parthenon Publishing Group, New York (2003), pp. 91–100). This is a clinical finding that describes the diagnosis of some primary cicatricial alopecias as noted mainly in the central scalp, and includes CCCA, folliculitis decalvans, and any other potential centrally presenting cicatricial alopecia. This term is not often used in the literature to signify diagnostic terminology.
Epidemiology.
CCCA tends to present itself in the 20s and progresses over 20–30 years. One should consider this diagnosis in African Americans with what appears to be a female-pattern hair loss.
Etiology.
The mechanism of pathology of CCCA has only been postulated and not proven. However, one theory involves pressure exerted on the internal root sheath leading to damage, which leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the end result of scarring. African Americans are found to be at increased risk either because of the curled hair shaft, distinct styling practices, moisturizing hair products, or chemical processing techniques (especially in the youth population). Some have hypothesized that CCCA represents an end stage of traction alopecia. However, this theory does not ring true as many patients lack a report of traction hairstyling.
Histopathologic features.
Histopathologic features include perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate, concentric lamellar fibrosis (layers of fibroblast in papillary dermis), sebaceous gland loss and premature disintegration of the internal root sheath. Additionally, granulomatous inflammation secondary to follicular rupture has been noted (Sperling and Sau, 1992). Perifollicular erythema and follicular keratosis is usually absent.
Clinical presentation.
CCCA usually begins at the central (sagittal) midline of the scalp. It is symmetric and exhibits scarring as the name suggests. It involves solely the top of the scalp or may progress to Hamilton–Norwood scale Type VI or VII. Early symptoms may include pruritus, dysesthesias and tenderness. On examination the skin is thin with few follicular ostia and later in the disease the scalp may appear shiny.
Treatment.
Treatments for CCCA remain investigational. Altering hair care practices has not been proven to assist in hair rejuvenation. High-dose topical steroids, antibiotics, immunomodulators such as tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel), and anti-androgen/5alpha Reductase inhibitors have been used with unknown efficacy.

MOMS Trial

The MOMS Trial is a Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development (NICHD) sponsored study of prenatal and postnatal closure of myelomeningocele; a collaboration of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the University of California at San Francisco, Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and the George Washington University in Washington, D.C.
Introduction.
Spina bifida, or myelomeningocele is a type of open neural tube defect that can occur with problems with the early development of a fetus. Most researchers believe that both genetic and environmental factors play a role. During the first 28 days of a pregnancy, the brain and spinal cord form in the developing fetus. Spina bifida results when the tissue at the bottom of the spinal cord fails to close at the bottom end, or when neural tube closure is disrupted by some other means. The majority of babies with open spina bifida have a variety of medical problems including nerve damage and problems with motor function, this may include some amount of paralysis of the lower part of their body (this ranges from very mild to quite severe), loss of control of their bowels and bladder, and abnormalities of the brain. Closed spina bifida is probably more common than is currently recognised and includes a range of subtle abnormalities where the neural tube is closed. This is sometimes referred to as spina bifida occulta. 
Historically, spina bifida was not detected before birth. Maternal serum screening of elevated alpha-fetoprotein at 16 to 18 weeks of gestation, followed by amniocentesis allowed detection of a minority of cases. A better option is the assessment of "Acetyl choline Esteras"e form amniotic fluid.Today, detection rate is 98% at the time of an anatomical screen ultrasound at 20 weeks of gestation.
For decades the standard treatment has been to close the spinal defect soon after the baby is born. This is called postnatal surgery. Recently, doctors have developed an experimental operation performed while the baby is still in the mother’s womb. This is called prenatal surgery. Prenatal surgery may improve the outcome of babies born with spina bifida.
History.
1980 - Fetal surgical techniques using animal models were first developed at the University of California, San Francisco by Dr. Michael R. Harrison, Dr. N. Scott Adzick and research colleagues.
1994 - The surgical model that is most similar to simulating the human disease is the fetal lamb model of myelomeningocele (MMC) introduced by Meuli and Adzick in 1994. The MMC-like defect was surgically created at 75 days of gestation (term 145 to 150 days) by a lumbo-sacral laminectomy. Approximately 3 weeks after creation of the defect a reversed latissimus dorsi flap was used to cover the exposed neural placode and the animals were delivered by cesarean section just prior term. Human MMC-like lesions with similar neurological deficit were found in the control newborn lambs. In contrast, animals that underwent closure had near-normal neurological function and well-preserved cytoarchitecture of the covered spinal cord on histopathological examination. Despite mild paraparesis, they were able to stand, walk, perform demanding motor test and demonstrated no signs of incontinence. Furthermore, sensory function of the hind limbs was present clinically and confirmed electrophysiologically. Further studies.showed that this model when combined with a lumbar spinal cord myelotomy leads to the hindbrain herniation characteristic of the Chiari II malformation and that in utero surgery restores normal hindbrain anatomy.
Surgeons at Vanderbilt University, led by Dr. Joseph Bruner, attempted to close spina bifida in 4 human fetuses using a skin graft from the mother using specialized telescope called a laparoscope. Four cases were performed before stopping the procedure - two of the four fetuses died.
1998 - Dr. N. Scott Adzick and team at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia performed open fetal surgery for spina bifida in an early gestation fetus (22 week gestation fetus) with a successful outcome.
Surgeons at Vanderbilt University, led by Dr. Noel Tulipan, made an incision in the mother's uterus to obtain better exposure to fetuses of 28 to 30 weeks gestation. All 4 fetuses were born premature but with evidence of reversal of their chiari II malformation. Only 2 of the 4 required ventricular shunts after birth. Fetal surgery after 25 weeks has not shown benefit in subsequent studies
Subsequently, 4 medical centers conducted 253 open spina bifida repairs prior to the MOMs trial. The outcomes were mixed and the only comparison groups were other children that had not undergone repair after birth in the past.
In February 2003, the National Institutes of Health began the Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS). Three centers (Vanderbilt University, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California at San Francisco) were chosen to participate in the study of 183 fetuses which were randomized, 91 for fetal repair and 92 for postnatal repair. The study took 8 years to complete at a cost of $22.5 million. Of the 1,087 fetuses and mothers initially screened for the study, 183 met all the inclusion criteria. The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia treated 77 patients, University of California at San Francisco treated 54 and Vanderbilt University treated 52.
Prenatal surgery was done at the assigned center between 19 and 25 weeks of pregnancy. Deliveries for both groups were performed by C-section at the assigned MOMS Center at approximately 37 weeks of pregnancy. The infants in the postnatal surgery group had their spina bifida closed at the MOMS Center as soon as possible after delivery, usually within 48 hours.
Medical information on the mothers and babies were gathered throughout the study and follow-up of their progress continued until the child reached at least two and a half years of age. Two outcomes were considered. The first, at 12 months, was death or need for a ventricular shunt. The second, measured at 30 months, was a composite score of standardized tests for mental and motor development.
Outcomes of the Trial.
An interim analysis conducted in December 2010, made public in February 2011, and released in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2011, showed a statistically significant benefit to the surgery and closed the trial.
The trial demonstrated that outcomes after prenatal spina bifida treatment are improved to the degree that the benefits of the surgery outweigh the maternal risks. Results were reported in the New England Journal of Medicine by Adzick et al.
Specifically, the study found that:
Based on these outcomes, fetal repair of spina bifida is now considered a standard of care at some fetal centers. However, prenatal repair is a complex and challenging procedure, requiring the most expert, comprehensive care for both mother and fetus. The surgical team’s level of experience in all aspects of care surrounding the operation are of paramount importance.

Holy Deadlock

Holy Deadlock is a 1934 satirical novel by the English author A. P. Herbert, which aimed to highlight the perceived inadequacies and absurdities of contemporary divorce law. The book took a particularly lenient view of the need for divorces, which it characterised as "a relief from misfortune, not a crime", and demonstrated how the current system created an environment which encouraged the participants to commit perjury and adultery. The book was a major element in the popular debate about the liberalisation of divorce law in the mid-1930s, and helped pave the way for the 1937 statutory reforms.
Background.
In the 1920s and 1930s, English law did not allow for divorce by mutual consent, but rather required proof of adultery, or violence by one party; misconduct by both parties could lead to the divorce being refused. Divorce was seen as a remedy for the innocent against the guilty. So this had the weird consequence, castigated in the book, that if one spouse had committed adultery, they could be divorced, but if both had, they couldn't – unless the court chose to exercise its discretion. That discretion was itself covered by peculiar rules of its own. To add a further hurdle, the law strictly prohibited "collusion" by the parties. This could extend to any sort of negotiation between them. An official—the King's Proctor—was charged with seeking out any evidence of the parties working together to secure a divorce.
Many couples of the time chose to petition on the grounds of adultery, even when no adultery had been committed. In this situation, a popular solution was what was known as "hotel evidence": the man and an uninvolved woman would travel to a seaside resort for a weekend, and go around publicly and ostentatiously as husband and wife. In the morning, they would take great care to be observed by the chambermaid in bed together when she brought in their breakfast. The pair would return home, and when the case came to court the maid would be called on to give evidence as a witness to this fictitious "adultery". After the trial, there would then be a six-month waiting period until the "decree nisi" granted at the trial was made absolute, and any misconduct by the "innocent" party in this time—or any evidence of collusion coming to light—could annul the divorce.
In effect, to secure an amicable divorce, one or both of the couple would have to commit perjury several times over—and potentially be liable for criminal penalties in so doing. Whilst the courts would often turn a blind eye to it, this was by no means guaranteed, and a system which virtually mandated perjury was felt by many to be scandalous.
Origins.
Divorce law reform had long been one of Herbert's "small causes", for which he agitated in the pages of "Punch". His first attempt to bring this particular cause to a broader audience was a play, "The White Witch" (1924), concerning a couple in a divorce suit who both protest that they had not committed adultery. The play was a failure, and closed after six weeks; Herbert felt that the "fatal" problem had been that "nobody made love" in the play. Arnold Bennett wrote that he was "very disappointed indeed" by it, and E. V. Lucas wrote that he loathed "adultery discussions in public. The theatre ... should be jollier than that".
Herbert had written three novels, with varying degrees of success.
"The Secret Battle" (1919), a critically acclaimed war novel, sold poorly on its original publication but was republished in 1930, and went through five subsequent editions.
"The House by the River" (1920) was a little-noted crime novel, which began to introduce elements of comedy into a tragic storyline.
"The Water Gipsies" (1930), a story about canal life, was a broad success, which went on to sell a quarter of a million copies and attract comparison to the works of Charles Dickens. By 1932, he was contemplating a fourth novel to capitalise on this last success; his editor at "Punch", E. V. Knox, encouraged him to put aside his theatrical work to focus on writing it.
He chose to make another attempt at writing on the theme of divorce reform. During a sailing holiday around Brittany with Sir Edward Spears and his wife Mary Borden in late 1932, he filled a notebook with the outline of what was to become "Holy Deadlock".
Before the novel was published, however, he took up the theme in one of his Misleading Cases, "Not a Crime". This was first published in "Still More Misleading Cases" (1933), and unusually does not seem to have been published in "Punch" beforehand. In this, he presented an innocent couple, married in haste during the First World War, who wished to divorce. The reader was told that after a farcical series of events had spun the case out, the "decree nisi" was refused because the wife (the petitioner) had been unfaithful after the trial, at which point the husband announced that he was fed up with the whole business and, as a party who was actually innocent, would it be possible for him to divorce his wife rather than the other way around? This led to a certain quandary: "Either Mr. Pale has committed misconduct, in which case the couple cannot be divorced, or he has not committed misconduct, in which case he can be sent to prison for pretending that he has". In this case, Herbert was able to let his judge give the "right" answer to the dilemma: he declared that the marriage was dissolved upon the suit of both parties, with no guilt attaching to either, and gave a two-page conclusion in which he decried the law as "illogical, cruel, barbarous and disgusting".
Plot summary.
The novel's plot is very similar to that of "Not a Crime", expanded and presented with a tragic ending rather than the earlier deus ex machina. The protagonists are a faultless and honest young couple, with the everyman names of John Adam and Mary Eve, who married impetuously, are now amicably separated, and wish to divorce so that they can remarry; neither has committed adultery nor desired to. Because of the lack of legal provision, they are compelled to collude to present a fictional cause for divorce; Mary asks Adam to "act like a gentleman" and provide the pretext, as her fiancé, Martin Seal, cannot be named as a co-respondent without risking his job (he works as an announcer for the BBC). After his first attempt to obtain the necessary evidence, the maid refuses to identify him in court and the case collapses; at the second attempt, his "partner" develops measles and has to be supported in the hotel for several weeks at great expense. A "decree nisi" is granted but, during the waiting period, Mary spends the night with Seal and is reported by an acquaintance to the King's Proctor, who reports that the divorce should not be granted. She fights the case, but the judge refuses to exercise any discretion in her favour, and declines to grant a divorce. By the end of the book, Mary and Adam are separated but remain legally married. Seal has lost his position after being named in the final court case, but can choose to live with Mary without excessive social stigma. However, John is a broken man, legally unable to marry his lover—and, as she is a school headmistress, socially unable to continue associating with her. On the last page, he departs in the company of a prostitute, announcing that he intends to "behave like a gentleman—at last!"
Reaction.
The book sold more than ninety thousand copies, and was selected by the Book of the Month Club in the United States. It was widely discussed at the time, and was a "sensation on both sides of the Atlantic". It has been compared to Evelyn Waugh's "A Handful of Dust", which also described a wealthy couple colluding to obtain a divorce, although the two were very different in tone.
Public reaction was widespread, with Herbert receiving a vast amount of correspondence, much of it under the belief that he himself was unhappily married. Rudyard Kipling summarised much of the reaction when he wrote that the book made him "...sick. I knew things were pretty heathen in that department... but I didn't realise they were worse than heathen". The novel has been noted as a major step in influencing public opinion to support a liberalisation of the divorce laws, though Herbert himself would claim that it merely "helped to create a more favourable attitude".
From a legal standpoint, it has been seen as a "classically excellent" example of how to provide complex legal exposition through fiction, and at one point was used as a textbook; a legal reviewer described it as "a singularly accurate presentation of the law an admirable picture of divorce practice in England". As well as the facts of the law, the novel detailed the practical intricacies which were routinely used to get around it, and highlighted the absurdity and human costs of the existing situation.
However, it focused almost entirely on the legal aspects; the broader social issues were not discussed, and the opponents of reform portrayed as "only self-righteous bigots and nice old clergymen incapable of reason". The lawyers were shown as disinterested and well-informed figures who would tirelessly pursue what they saw as their client's best interests, whilst the protagonists themselves were "sacrificed ... to the sociology, but they do it with a good grace".
The political overtones of the "frankly polemical attack" were noted, and a shortly after publication a question was raised in the House of Commons by Frederick Macquisten, who felt that, as a result of the book, "His Majesty's judges and courts, and the legal code which they administer in matrimonial causes, are held up to public ridicule and contempt"; the Attorney-General declined to pursue the matter.
Later developments.
Herbert continued his campaign after the publication of the book, with significant success. In 1935, he was elected to the House of Commons as an Independent Member of Parliament for Oxford University, and in his maiden speech vowed to introduce a private bill to reform divorce law. This Bill was eventually introduced in 1936, and became law as the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937, a process described in his book "The Ayes Have It".
It was reported in 1939 that a film of the book was planned for the following year, but it never appeared. Herbert, who had written the treatment, believed that it was vetoed by the film censor because "that official has always been a Catholic".
Herbert would return to the theme of matrimonial law reform—in this case, the remarriage of divorcees—in his novel "Made for Man" (1957).

Callejón de Hamel.
April 21, 1990 he started with murals and sculptures in the street Callejón de Hamel, near University of Havana. For sculptures he used scrap objects like bathtubs, hand pumps, pin wheels etc., and for the murals he used different kind of available paint, including car enamel.
Even though the first four years became difficult, he was inspired by local inhabitants and visitors to continue his work, and little by little, the street was transformed from a slum area to an enthusiastic Afro-Cuban centre.
Today there is workshops for young Cuban children to learn painting. Every Sunday there is Rumba-music, and every Friday Cuban music in the street.
This is still Salvador's artistic headquarter.
Later exhibitions.
From 1990 he is represented at various exhibitions at Cuba. From 1992 he had several exhibitions abroad:

Arthur A. Cashmore (30 October 1893 - 1969) was an English footballer. His regular position was as a forward.
Career.
Born in Birmingham, Cashmore had previously played for local sides Sparkhill Avondale, Bromsgrove Rovers and Stourbridge when he joined Manchester United in June 1913. He made his debut for the club on 13 September 1913 in a 1–0 defeat to Bolton Wanderers but went on to make just two more appearances for the club before being sold to Oldham Athletic at the end of the 1913–14 season for £100. In his first season at Boundary Park he scored eight goals in 16 games as he helped Oldham to a second-place finish in Division One.
However, Cashmore was later hampered by injuries and left the club, playing for non-league side Darlaston. Following the resumption of league football at the end of the First World War, Cashmore joined Southern Football League side Cardiff City, finishing his first season as the club's top scorer with 14 goals. He remained with the club on their entry into The Football League the following year, forming a partnership with Jimmy Gill and playing in their first Football League match, a 5–2 win over Stockport County, as well as later becoming the first player to score a Football League goal at Ninian Park in the return fixture between the two teams on 4 September 1920.

Battle of Pantino

The Battle of Pantino was fought between the Byzantine Empire and Serbian Principality in 1167. It resulted in the crowning of Stefan Nemanja.
Background.
Tihomir had Nemanja captured and chained after he had built monasteries without talking to Tihomir, the lands of Nemanja were seized but Nemanja's supporters conspired to the church that Tihomir had done all this because of his disapproval with the building of churches and thus became targeted by the clergy, something that would boost Nemanja's respect. Nemanja was later freed and regained rule some of his previous lands.
Stefan Nemanja successfully overthrowed Tihomir, who fled to Greece with his brothers.
The battle.
A Byzantine army was assembled for the Byzantine ally Tihomir, who came in from Skopje. The two armies collided at "Pantino" near Zvečan, present-day Kosovo. After a decisive battle, the Byzantine force was crushed and quickly began retreating. Tihomir drowned in the Sitnica river and Nemanja's remaining brothers were pardoned, recognizing Stefan as supreme ruler of Serbia, crowned as "Ruler of All Serbia".
Aftermath.
The battle was decisive in the fact that it ensured the unity of all Serbian princes and their ultimate loyalty to Stefan Nemanja. This later paved the way for the consolidation of Serbia and its eventual formation into a kingdom.

He became a useful forward for Stoke and scored five goals in a 10–1 win over Caernarfon Wanderers in the FA Cup during the 1886–87 season. He was a member of the Stoke squad in their first two seasons in the Football League and like the rest of the team Edge struggled and in 1890, Stoke failed to gain re-election and joined the Football Alliance. Stoke were much more successful as they finished as champions of the Alliance with Edge scoring 12 goals.
Stoke re-gained their place in the Football League but Edge stayed in the Alliance signing for Manchester based Newton Heath. Whilst at Newton Heath he was suspended by the FA for also playing for Nottingham Jardines Athletic. His ban was lifted after an investigation and he re-joined Stoke in 1892.

Alan Foggon

Alan Foggon (born 23 February 1950) is a former English footballer. His regular position was as a forward. He was born in West Pelton, County Durham.
Foggon graduated from the junior and reserve sides at Newcastle United to make his first-team debut just days before his 18th birthday, in a 0–0 draw at Arsenal. A schoolboy sprint champion, Foggon's moment of glory came in the second leg of the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final in Budapest when his shot was pushed onto the crossbar by the Ujpest 'keeper, but the United man followed up to lash the ball into the net and make it 3–2 on the night, 6–2 on aggregate.
He moved on to Cardiff City,in August 1971, but within a year had returned to the North East, signing for Jack Charlton's Middlesbrough, side. Foggon became a favourite of the Ayresome Park crowd and helped the Teesiders to promotion from Division Two in 1974.
After brief stints with Rochester Lancers and Hartford Bicentennials in the United States, Foggon moved to Manchester United in 1976. That proved to be something of a disaster though and after just three league outings at Old Trafford he switched to the Mackems.

Pinocchio (1957 TV-musical)

The 1957 television production of "Pinocchio" was a live (and live-action) musical version starring Mickey Rooney in the title role of the puppet who wishes to become a real boy. Based on the novel by Carlo Collodi which also inspired the classic Walt Disney animated film, this version featured a now-forgotten new score by Alec Wilder and William Engvick. It was telecast once on NBC as a television special, and, as far as is known, never repeated again, or even restaged with a different cast as was Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella". Nor has it ever been issued on VHS or DVD. Other notable actors who appeared in the special included Walter Slezak (as Geppetto), Fran Allison (as the Blue Fairy), Martyn Green (as the Fox), Jerry Colonna (as a Ringmaster), and Stubby Kaye as a Town Crier, a role he repeated in Wilder and Engvick's 1958 television musical, "Hansel and Gretel". "Pinocchio" was directed by noted Broadway choreographer Hanya Holm. 
This was the second of many versions of "Pinocchio" that have been written especially for television, the most recent being in 2008. The first television "Pinocchio" was a satirical version featured as an episode of "The Spike Jones Show" in 1954. Jones himself played the title role. 
The 1957 special was one of many children's fantasy musical specials to be shown on television between 1955 and 1959 in the wake of the enormously successful first two telecasts of the Mary Martin musical "Peter Pan".
One novel touch about the 1957 "Pinocchio" was that when the puppet finally became a real boy, pieces of wood began falling off of his body onto the floor. 
Although it has been erroneously claimed that the program no longer exists, it has apparently survived on kinescope. And after languishing in obscurity for years, a cast album of the show has been issued on CD. According to sources, however, Gordon B. Clarke substitutes for Walter Slezak on the album.

Districts of Sweden

Municipalities in Sweden are in some rare cases divided into smaller districts (sometimes translated "boroughs"), and are sometimes assigned administrative boards responsible for certain areas of governance in their respective areas. These districts are not specified by national Swedish law, but rather are created by individual municipalities, and thus the Swedish names of these districts vary greatly from municipality to municipality, including kommundelar, stadsdelar, stadsdelområden, primärområden, or stadsdelsnämndsområden. The degree of administrative autonomy of these districts similarly varies greatly, but is normally very limited.
Stockholm.
Overview.
The city council ("kommunfullmäktige") of Stockholm Municipality has divided the city into smaller subdivisions. The city uses the English term "district" (Swedish: "stadsdelområde") to describe these subdivisions.
The districts were first created in 1997 to facilitate the efficiency of local government in Stockholm. The number of districts was reduced from 24 to 18 the following year, and reduced again to the current 14 in 2007. Since the establishment of these districts, certain administrative tasks, such as school administration were re-centralized.
Each district has its own district administration, led by a district council, which is responsible for certain areas of municipal governance within their district, including pre-school education, park maintenance, local economic initiatives, elderly services, financial counseling, and refugee reception services. Individual district councils have no power over city planning or tax policy, both of which are retained by the central city council.
The councilors that serve on these district councils are often part-time politicians, also holding other employment. They are preferably residents of the district whose council they serve upon. The central city council itself is responsible for setting the budget, goals, and responsibilities of the district councils. The city council also appoints the members of each district council, so the political makeup of the district council resembles that of the central city council, not necessarily that of the district. The member of the district council are not elected in any fashion by the residents of the district in question.
Stockholm's 14 districts are sometimes divided into smaller parts for statistical purposes, however these smaller districts have no administrative function in the city's governance.
Districts.
Stockholm has 14 districts as of the administrative changes made in 2007:
Gothenburg.
Overview.
Gothenburg Municipality ("Göteborgs stad") is also divided into subdivisions which it refers to as "districts" in English, though as with Stockholm's districts, they are often referred to as boroughs in unofficial contexts. The Swedish term used by the city council is "stadsdelsnämndsområden" (literally "city-part committee area"). These districts were created in 1990. Just like in Stockholm, these districts each have a local governing body which Gothenburg calls "district committees." These committees serve a nearly identical function to Stockholm's district councils, including recreation, local economic issues and social services, and the lower levels of the education system, and like Stockholm's councils, these committees are appointed by the centralized city council.
Gothenburg is divided into 21 districts, each with a district committee. These 21 districts can be further divided into 94 subdivisions (called "primärområden") which exist only for statistical and organizational purposes, and serve no administrative function.
Districts.
The 21 districts of Gothenburg and the premiärområden enclosed within each:
Malmö.
Overview.
Malmö Municipality ("Malmö stad") is divided into five districts (). These districts each have a board or council called a "stadsdelsfullmäktige", each consisting of eleven members, which are responsible for various local administrative tasks. In Malmö, the district councils are also responsible for assisting members of the community in contacting their politicians or navigating their way through government agencies.
Districts.
These are the five districts of Malmö:
Other examples.
Other smaller municipalities in Sweden also use municipal subdivisions for official purposes, however these are not always administrative. For example Strängnäs Municipality uses district councils ("kommundelsråd") which serve a purely advisory function and have no administrative power.
Borås Municipality is divided into ten districts ("kommundelar"), each with a district council ("kommundelsnnämd") responsible for pre-school and primary school, recreational services, and services for the elderly.
Torshälla is a region inside Eskilstuna Municipality which has withheld a degree of autonomy since merging with Eskilstuna, including their own city council (Torshälla stads nämd).
Other municipalities that use districts for advisory or administrative purposes include Huddinge, Kalmar, Köping, Södertälje, Umeå and Västerås.

Long before the coming of the Spaniards to Zamboanga, the place has no name. And this is how Putik got its name. At the time when the Spaniards occupied Zamboanga, they usually go around to see different places. One day, they met a tradesman who came from Luzon. The tradesman accompanied by the Spaniards went sight-seeing around the place. It was a rainy season that time and the soil seemed like clay, and so it was slippery. While they were walking, one of the Spaniards stumbled down. He suddenly stood up and asked the trader what was the name of the place. He answered “putik”, he meant muddy. That knowing the tradesman does not know Spanish.
From that time and until now, they call this place as PUTIK.

Zalita v. Bush

Zalita v. Bush
is a writ of habeas corpus filed on behalf of Guantanamo captive Abu Abdul Rauf Zalita 
before US District Court Judge 
Ricardo M. Urbina.
On January 2, 2008 the Project to Enforce the Geneva Conventions named Zalita v. Bush on a list of "notable GTMO and related cases".
The United States Supreme Court's May 1, 2007 decision not to review the ruling of a lower court that the Military Commissions Act had stripped the Judicial Branch of jurisdiction over Guantanamo captives was described as a victory for the Bush Presidency.
However, following its ruling in Boumediene v. Bush, which restored the Guantanamo captives' access to the US justice system the Supreme Court particularly directed the circuit court to reconsider Zalita's case.
Military Commissions Act.
The Military Commissions Act of 2006 mandated that Guantanamo captives were no longer entitled to access the US civil justice system, so all outstanding habeas corpus petitions were stayed.
On April 25, 2007 a request that would bar camp authorities from transferring Zalita back to Libya was denied.
Zalita feared reprisals from the Government if returned to Libya. His lawyers had requested an order that would compel the executive branch to give them 30 days notice prior to transferring him from Guantanamo—enough time for them to file a request with the court to stop the executive branch. 
His request was denied because the judge ruled the Military Commissions Act stripped the court of jurisdiction. 
The Department of Justice cited the ruling in Zalita v. Bush in its arguments when other captives made similar appeals.
Following Urbina's April 25, 2007 ruling the Center for Constitutional Rights filed an emergency injunction with the United States Supreme Court on May 1, 2007.
The Supreme Court declined to consider the filing.
Boumediene v. Bush.
On June 12, 2008 the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Boumediene v. Bush, that the Military Commissions Act could not remove the right for Guantanamo captives to access the US Federal Court system. And all previous Guantanamo captives' habeas petitions were eligible to be re-instated.
The judges considering the captives' habeas petitions would be considering whether the evidence used to compile the allegations the men and boys were enemy combatants justified a classification of "enemy combatant".
Re-initiation.
On 8 December 2008 Shayana D. Kadidal and other lawyers associated with the Center for Constitutional Rights and Paul E. Ohern 
and other Department of Justice officials submitted a Joint Status Report on behalf of Zalita and several other captives.
According to the Joint Status Report
he was transferred to Guantanamo in August 2002, and his habeas petition was first filed in June 2005. He fears repatriation to Libya, and has requested asylum in Switzerland.

Ottawa Street Power Station

Ottawa Street Power Station is a former municipal electric and steam utility generating station for the Lansing Board of Water and Light in Lansing, Michigan, located on the Grand River in the city's central business district that was redeveloped as corporate headquarters for the Accident Fund Insurance Company of America.
Design and construction.
The engineering design of the plant was by Ralph C. Roe and Allen Burns of the firm of Burns and Roe, and represented an improvement over the design of the Bremo Station in Virginia, which the two had designed while employed at Electric Management and Engineering Company. The architectural design was by Edwyn A. Bowd of Bowd and Munson. Construction began in 1937 and, due to material shortages caused by the outbreak of World War II, completed in two phases. The first phase, which consisted of the southern half of the building, was completed in 1939. The second phase was completed in 1946. In total, the project cost $4 million, all of it from ratepayers without the issuance of bonds or government funds. 
The tall Art Deco step-back structure sits on a polished black granite water table, with an intricate exterior design of multicolor brick. The design symbolizes the combustion of coal, and graduates from dark purple at the base through reds and orange in the middle, to light yellow at the top, alternating with bands of limestone, and with limestone parapets and trim. The Ottawa Street station was praised for its engineering and architecture in trade publications of the day, and immediately became the city's preeminent Art Deco landmark. Bowd subsequently designed a number of other prominent Art Deco and Streamline Moderne buildings in the Lansing area, including the J.W. Knapp Company Building.
Operating History.
The Ottawa Street station provided electricity and steam to the downtown Lansing area from 1939 through the late 1980s. The plant had a generating capacity of 81,500-kilowatts. By 1971, improvements at the Board of Water and Light's Eckert Station permitted the Ottawa Street Station to operate as a backup station for electric generation. It continued to provide steam service into the 1980s. In 1984, the Board of Water and Light's Eckert Station began providing steam service, initially as a backup to the Ottawa Street Station, but eventually as the primary steam service source. As equipment became obsolete, it was removed from the Ottawa Street Station, and ultimately it was decommissioned in 1992 for electric and steam. In 2001, a portion of the station was renovated to provide chilled water service for air conditioning. It continued to operate as a water chilling plant until September 2009, when the Board of Water and Light completed a new chilled water plant in downtown Lansing.
Redevelopment.
Following decommissioning, the City of Lansing explored various options for redevelopment of the Ottawa Street Station. In 2007, it was sold to be redeveloped as corporate headquarters for the Accident Fund Insurance Company of America. Massive renovations to convert the plant to an office building with a campus were made over a two-year period by The Christman Company, and completed in the first quarter of 2011.
The redevelopment project won numerous awards, including:
National Register of Historic Places Listing.
The Ottawa Street Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 26, 2008.
It is the 22nd property listed as a featured property of the week in a program of the National Park Service that began in July 2008.

William Henderson (physician and homeopath)

Dr. William Henderson (born 1810 in Thurso, Caithness, Scotland; d. 1872) was a conventionally trained Scottish physician who became an influential advocate for homeopathy in Great Britain.
William Henderson was appointed professor of general pathology at the University of Edinburgh and physician-in-ordinary to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. He authored important articles on the clinical and pathological aspects of aortic and heart disease. He also contributed to the recognition as separate diseases of typhus and typhoid fever.
Henderson was early advocate for homeopathy in Scotland and was at the centre of the controversy surrounding the introduction of homeopathy to Edinburgh in the early 1840s. This involved the Faculty of Medicine, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (RCPE) and medical societies as well as prominent medical figures of the period including Sir John Forbes, Professor Sir James Simpson, Professor Sir Robert Christison and Professor James Syme. Many Scottish physicians were influenced by Henderson's teachings and they in turn were involved in the wider introduction of homeopathy in Britain.
In his retirement Dr. Henderson authored a reference work on the Bible that gave ample evidence of his extensive religious knowledge and deeply held convictions.

Jack Knight (songwriter)

Jack Knight is an American songwriter and producer. He is also a published author and founder of The Jack Knight Songwriters Academy.
Biography.
Originally from Brooklyn, New York, United States, Knight moved with his grandparents to Chesapeake, Virginia, at the age of 17. As a teenager, he performed in a local rap group, and then signed as a solo artist to Def Jam Recordings in 1995. His voice was first heard on Monifah’s “Touch It”, but he has been a songwriter since 1994.
As the first songwriter signed to Sean “Diddy” Combs publishing company in 1998, Knight has written, recorded and produced hit records for artists like Matisyahu, Lil' Kim, Usher, Keyshia Cole, Diddy, Jennifer Lopez, Christina Aguilera, Biggie, Total, Carl Thomas, Chico DeBarge, Rakim, Monifah, Blackstreet, Lyric, Faith Evans, Tamia and many others.
He also started Finding Your Way Worldwide, which has been implemented in Washington Heights, Harlem, London, Stockholm, Sweden, Canada, East New York, Brooklyn and Richmond which is where it’s based. Finding Your Way is a music program that, through the art of songwriting, teaches kids the significance of incorporating and promoting social change in their homes, communities and environment.
"My calling is also giving, teaching and empowering the youth," he says. "This is something else I do on the side besides my job as a songwriter. It’s more than me that I am trying to help. It’s a group of youth that I’m trying to teach life skills through music. This program can revolutionize the way teachers teach urban youth and the way kids with a learning disability learn."
In his 2006 book, "The Art of Writing A Hit Song: The Urban Experience", Jack breaks down the process of creating and developing a hit song in seven formulated steps. He also offers online songwriting courses through The Jack Knight Songwriters Academy, which employs an intense curriculum to prepare up and coming songwriters for the main stream media.
In 1999, Knight decided to move into the realm of recording, releasing his debut album, "Gypsy Blues", on Universal Records. He was the first writer signed to Sean 'Diddy' Combs publishing company, the Writing Factory, where he continues to write, record, and produce on a regular basis.
More recently, Knight traveled to Europe and Africa to collaborate with musicians there and also to promote social change and education for young people around the world. He is completing a DVD of his travels called "Finding Your Way: Through The Art of Songwriting" to document his mission. In addition, he is at work on new projects for his new multimedia Company Jack Knight Creative.

Tommy Dunderdale

Thomas Dunderdale (May 6, 1887 – December 15, 1960) was a professional ice hockey forward. Born in Australia, he moved to Canada at the age of 17, in 1904. He played in Winnipeg for three seasons, from 1906 to 1910. In 1910, he joined the Montreal Shamrocks of the National Hockey Association (NHA), before moving on to the Quebec Bulldogs the following season. In 1911–12, he joined the Victoria Aristocrats of the newly formed Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), playing nine seasons in total in Victoria. He split his seasons in Victoria with a three-season stint with the Portland Rosebuds between 1915 and 1918. After the PCHA folded in 1923, Dunderdale played one season in the West Coast Hockey League (WCHL), splitting the season between the Saskatoon Crescents and the Edmonton Eskimos. In 1974, he became the only Australian-born player to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Dunderdale is credited with scoring the first penalty shot goal in ice hockey history.
Early life.
Dunderdale was born in Benalla, Victoria, Australia, on May 6, 1887. His parents were originally from England, but in 1904, the Dunderdales resettled to Ottawa, Ontario. Tommy first played organized ice hockey at the age of 17 with his Waller Street School team. In 1905 he moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba and played the 1905–06 season with the amateur Winnipeg Ramblers.
Playing career.
Dunderdale turned professional in 1906–07 season with the Winnipeg Strathconas. He played three seasons for the franchise, which was also known as the Winnipeg Maple Leafs and the Winnipeg Shamrocks, scoring on average more than two points per game, with the majority of the points being goals. In 1909–10, Dunderdale moved east, and played with the Montreal Shamrocks, first with the Canadian Hockey Association, and later with the National Hockey Association (NHA). That season, he appeared in 15 games overall, and scored 21 goals. He played the 1910–11 season for the Quebec Bulldogs of the NHA, finishing second on the team in scoring, with 13 goals, even though he played only nine out of 16 games, and receiving 25 penalty minutes.
Dunderdale went back west in the 1911–12 season, joining the Victoria Aristocrats of the newly formed Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). He would spend the rest of his career playing in the west, having playing only two seasons east of the Manitoba-Ontario border. Scoring 24 goals in 16 games, Dunderdale received his first out of six First All-Star team selections in the PCHA, as well as his first of four consecutive. In the next two seasons, Dunderdale recorded similar statistics to his first season in the PCHA, again scoring 24 goals in both seasons, and he was named to the First All-Star team in both seasons. The 1912–13 season saw the Victoria Aristocrats challenge the Quebec Bulldogs for the Stanley Cup. Although the Aristocrats won the series, their challenge was not accepted by the Stanley Cup trustees. The 1914–15 season saw Dunderdale named to the First All-Star team for his fourth consecutive time, as he scored 17 goals and assisted on 10 others, for 27 points in 17 games.
In the 1915–16 season, Dunderdale joined the Portland Rosebuds. In his first season with the Rosebuds, he dropped below a point per game for the first time in his career. The Rosebuds became the first American team to challenge for the Stanley Cup that year, losing a best-of-five series 3–2 to the Montreal Canadiens. Dunderdale played in all five games of the series, scoring two points. The following season, he scored 22 goals in 24 games, returning to his usual offensive output. However, he was more noted that season for his number of penalty minutes, setting a league record with 141 minutes. The 1917–18 season was his last in Portland, as he scored 14 goals in 18 games. Dunderdale left as their leading penalty minute getter, and as their second-most prolific goal scorer, with 50 goals.
Dunderdale rejoined the Victoria Aristocrats in the 1918–19 season. After recording only nine points in 20 games in his first season back with the Aristocrats, he scored 26 goals in 22 games in the 1919–20 season, en route to his fifth First All-Star team selection. Dunderdale played three more seasons for Victoria, which was renamed from the Aristocrats to the Cougars for the 1921–22 season, playing 75 games in total and scoring 41 points. He scored a bit under a point per game during the 1920–21 and the 1921–22 season, while in the 1922–23 season, his last with Victoria, he was limited to only two goals in 27 games. He was named for his sixth time to the First All-Star Team in 1922. Following the conclusion of the 1922–23 season, the PCHA folded. Dunderdale played another season in the West Coast Hockey League (WCHL), splitting the 1923–24 season between the Saskatoon Crescents and the Edmonton Eskimos, scoring three points in 17 games overall.
Dunderdale is credited with scoring the first penalty shot goal in history. The first goal was scored on December 12, 1921 by Dunderdale on Hugh Lehman. The shot was taken from one of three dots painted on the ice from the goal. Players had to skate to the dot and shoot the puck from the dot.
Legacy.
Dunderdale retired at the end of the 1923–24 season. He retired as the PCHA's leading goal scorer, with 194 goals in total. He was a six-time PCHA First Team All-Star, and led the league in goals in three seasons, and in points in two. He was noted as being an excellent stickhandler and a fast skater. After retiring from playing, he coached and managed teams in Edmonton, Los Angeles, and Winnipeg. He died on December 15, 1960, and became the only Australian-born player to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, in 1974.

Fairfax Islands

Fairfax Islands is a pair of small coral cays, both of which have been used as a bombing range. They are located near the Tropic of Capricorn in the southern Great Barrier Reef, 113 km due east of Gladstone, Queensland, Australia, and 405 km north of the state capital Brisbane.
The island is the third island in the Great Barrier Reef chain of islands (with the first being Lady Elliot Island), and is part of the Capricorn and Bunker Group of islands and forms part of the Capricornia Cays National Park as well as of the Capricornia Cays Important Bird Area. Most people only see the island by the more easily reached Lady Musgrave Island, which can be readily reached by fast catamaran from the town of 1770, Queensland, or from Gladstone, both of which are located approximately five hours drive north of Brisbane.
Fairfax Islands
Geomorphology and landscape.
The eastern cay is composed of shingle and the western of sand and shingle. Interference with the vegetation of the eastern cay occurred as a result of phosphate mining and secondly during the period when the Australian Military Forces used the area as a bombing target. The cay is no longer used for either purposes. Vegetation is dominated by "Pisonia grandis" which is restricted to the centre of the island. Two brackish pools are located towards the eastern end of the island.
The western cay features an elongated sand spit that supports vegetation on its western extremity. Vegetation is similar to that occurring on the larger sand cays of the Capricorn Group. A tin shed, erected by the Australian Navy when the eastern cay was used for bombing practice, is located in the centre of the island.
The Capricorn and Bunker Cays form part of a distinct geomorphic province at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef (Hopley 1982). The cays and their reefs lie on the western marginal shelf, and are separated from the mainland by the Curtis Channel. The cays are not generally visible from the mainland, although Masthead Island may be viewed from Mount Larcom on a clear day.
Geologically the cays are young, having developed during the Holocene period, they are mostly around 5000 years old. The sea level was much lower during the last Ice Age (at the end of the Pleistocene period) and the coastal plane on which today’s reefs and cays developed was completely exposed. Early in the Holocene (around 10,000 years ago) the sea level began to rise, until it stabilised at its present level around 6000 years ago. Once the sea level stabilised, it was possible for reef flats to expand and provide potential sites for the formation of cays.
Fairfax Islands area a Closed Ring Reefs and the two coral cays belong to two distinct types:
History.
Discovery.
In 1803 Captain Eber Bunker of the whaling ship "Albion" was the first European to discover the region and gave his name to the southern group.
During a second whaling voyage from England in the "Albion" he discovered the Bunker Islands off the Queensland coast.
The "Albion" was 362 tons and registered in London, the ship was fitted with 10 guns, and a crew of 26; she was built in Deptfordand, Britain ownered by, Messrs. Champion; and used for general cargo
The southern cays and reefs were first chartered between 1819 and 1821 by Lieutenant Phillip Parker King RN initially in the "Mermaid" and later in the "Bathurst". The main charting exercise for all the islands and reefs was carried out in 1843 under the command of Captain Francis Blackwood in "HMS Fly" which was accompanied by the "Bramble". The naturalist, Professor J. Beete Jukes, was on board the "Fly" and his published journal provides valuable information on some of the cays.
Mining of guano in the 1890s.
The mining of guano (bird droppings) occurred on Lady Musgrave Island, Fairfax and North West Island during the 1890s. This was an extension of a more substantial guano mining operation on Lady Elliot Island to the south. Some remains of these activities are still evident.
A good description of part of the operations from 1899 can be found below
The Pacific Islands Company, having worked cut the guano deposits at Fairfax Island, Bunker Group, is now transferring their plant to North-west Island In the Capricorn Group, which will be "the head- quarters for some time to" come (says the "Bundaberg Star" of yesterday). The steamer "Lady Musgrave", which was chartered by the company for this work, returned to Bundaberg on Sunday afternoon, bringing Mr. A. E. Ellis, the local manager, and account forty Japanese, whose services are being dispensed with. The captain of the "Lady Musgrave" reports that he had helped to complete the work of removal from Fairfax to North-east Island. In about ten days, but, owing to the bad weather experienced, it occupied sixteen days to get through with It. So bad was the weather, that in fourteen days the vessel was only able to Steam for fifty hours, the steamer having to take shelter behind one of the islands from the heavy squalls and rain. The "Lady Musgrave" left Fairfax Island at 4 p.m. on Saturday, with the ketch "Loma Doone" in tow. Heavy weather was encountered, and at 3 p.m. on Sunday the line parted, and notwithstanding all the efforts made, it proved impossible to pick up the ketch again, and it was decided to make for Burnett Heads, which were not reached, as stated, till 4 p.m. the same day. The "Loma Doone" apparently got through all right, for she was reported off Bustard Head on Sunday, and is expected to arrive here tomorrow
Military target practice at Fairfax Islands, 1943–1965.
East and West Fairfax Islands were used as a bombing range by the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy. This ceased over 40 years ago, and the vegetation of these two cays has largely recovered. Bomb disposal experts have found and destroyed unexploded ordnance left from the bombing, however advice from the Australian Army suggest that many more unexploded ordnance will be on the Island
The islands have physically changed with old craters on the right end of the larger of the two islands (East Fairfax)
Changes have occurred in the morphology, vegetation and sea-bird populations of Fairfax Island as a result of military bombing practice between 1943 and at least 1965, during and after, the Second World War, Fairfax Islands (particularly East Fairfax Island) has suffered environmental degradation as this affected the island habitats which was used many times as a bombing and shelling
One report by a National Park Ranger, describing the condition of the island before the Second World War, stated that:
one section of Fairfax Island was thickly timbered with "Pisonia umbellifera", "Pandanus pedunculatus", and "Casuarina" (Oak); [...] bird life is very plentiful on this island and during the time of his visit the Brown Gannet were nesting there in thousands; and [...] the island is also the nesting place of the Mutton bird during the nesting season.
Yet when the Queensland government Ichthyologist, Mr T. C. Marshall, visited Fairfax Island shortly after 1945, he commented that the gannet rookery there ‘was not one tenth its pre-war size when you could hardly move among the thousands of nests without stepping upon one of them’, and he attributed the decline of the bird population to naval bombing practices during the war.
Another report in 1953 by C. Roff, described the effects of bombing practice at Fairfax Island as:
Large numbers of the brown gannet, "Sula leucogaster", are breeding on the island [...]. Birds continue to sit on nests whilst aircraft roar overhead and rockets explode. [...] The gannets still extensively use the island although it has been used as a target area since 1943, and in some instances, apparently during the war years, was actually bombed and shelled.
Mr. D. Jolly in April 1954, contained the following description:
as the result of the bombing and shelling of the National Park by the Navy, there are some large shell craters at the eastern portion of the island in which an elephant could be buried. Fortunately this area is tree less. On the western portion of the west island are some bomb craters near and among the trees. After the attack on the island by the Navy the trees were almost stripped of leaves.
Ecology.
Natural.
Green turtle rookeries are located at Wreck Island, West Fairfax and West Hoskyn Islands these are maintained in a natural condition, free from human disturbance;
There are also Brown Booby breeding colonies at East and West Fairfax and East Hoskyn Islands
Pests.
The island have had a reasonable long exposure to introduced pests firstly goats were introduced to the island in the Guano mining period these were latter eradicated from East and West Fairfax Islands in the early 1970s.
Until recently, East and West Fairfax Islands were also infested with two species of rats (black rats), and they were reportedly responsible for significant destruction of the seabird population, the island had also be infested and by cockroaches, but the rats have probably been eradicated through a recent National parks baiting program.
Locusts completely stripped the "Pisonia" foliage on west Fairfax Island in 1986 allowing sunlight to penetrate to the forest floor. An impenetrable metre-high thicket of "Wollastonia biflora" (Asteraceae) and other species rapidly developed but after eight months later the canopy had regrown, the forest floor was again in shade and the undergrowth thicket was dead.
Known shipwrecks on the reef.
"Diana", a wooden carvel schooner / brig of 103 tons and 70 feet in length built in Sydney in 1847 by the builder Ale and owned by C.L. Throck. The vessel ran aground on 1 June 1864 in the Bunker Group at the North Western side of "middle island" (she was wrecked on Fairfax Island (middle island - Bunker group)) while loading guano
"Diana" was a vessel engaged in guano mining. "Boomerang" sighted the wreckage on the northwestern side of "middle Bunker Island" on 13 August 1864, and the crew went ashore and found part of the wreck had been salvaged with equipment and tents hauled onto one of the islands. The wreck had broken into two parts, with many timbers strewn about on the reef salvaged, but no sign of life. The crew had been rescued by the schooner "Caroline" (also reported by press as "Eleanor Palmer").

Wadela

Wadela (واديلا), also spell as Wadhela, is the name of a Baloch tribe in Balochistan and Makran in Pakistan.
They are an offshoot of the greater Mengal tribe who had to migrate westwards during the reign of Mir Abdullah Khan of Kalat in the early 18th century. Migrating from Wadh brought them the name Wadela, as it is found with any other tribe in Balochistan that a tribe keeps changing its name as it moves on to find a new settlement.
Wadela tribe was one of the important tribes in resisting the English army from capturing Makuran. This war was fought in the nineteenth century in the Gokprosh mountains. The Baloch fiercely defended their motherland. This defeat led the English army to retreat. The head of the Wadeyla tribe Mir Mubarik Wadela was given the name of Mir A Ne Salaar.
Clans.
The clans of the Wadela tribes are as following:
Saeet zai,
Bukkar zai,
Mahmad zai,
Gami zai,
Kaurkuchi,
Shahbek zai, and 
Bijar zai.
Settlements.
This tribe is living in majority in Bahu, Dashtyari, Karachi, Kulanch, Gwadar, Turbat, Pasni, Chahbhar, Oman, Thar (Near the border of India in Sindh). The headquarters of the Wadela tribe has remained Kolanch in Makuran since their migration from Wad.

Robin Toner

Roberta "Robin" Denise Toner (1954–2008) was an American journalist. She was the first woman to be national political correspondent for "The New York Times".
Robin Toner was born on May 22, 1954, in Chester, Pennsylvania and grew up in Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania. Her father, Charles, was an oil refinery supervisor and World War II pilot; her mother, Mary Louise, was a homemaker. One of six children, Toner was a summa cum laude graduate of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. She reported for "The Charleston Daily Mail" in West Virginia and "The Atlanta Journal and Constitution" before joining the "Times" in 1985.
In 1992, Toner was the lead reporter on Bill Clinton's presidential election. She later became chief of correspondents on the paper's national desk in New York, coaching reporters in other bureaus, and also had held the title of senior writer, covering topics including abortion rights and judicial nominations.
"When you watched her work — relentless on the phone, gnawing her fingernails to the nub, a perfectionist on the keyboard you'd think: a workhorse, not a showhorse," Bill Keller, executive editor of "The New York Times", said on its Web site. "Then you'd read the result and it would be elegant. She was one of the best."
Michael Oreskes, a former "Times" Washington bureau chief who is now managing editor for U.S. news at the "Associated Press", praised Toner as "the toughest, smartest and straightest political reporter I have ever known."
"She loved covering politics, because it was about people, with all their heroics and flaws and just plain boneheadedness," he said. "She was full of passion and moral outrage but had not one ounce of that bane of modern journalism, cynicism. That's why her stories were so memorable."
In her 25 years with "The New York Times", she published more than 1,900 articles of which six required corrections. This was a result of her own system of verifying and confirming dates, names, facts and figures in her initial version of articles, steps taken by few other reporters.
Robin died of complications resulting from colon cancer on December 12, 2008.
