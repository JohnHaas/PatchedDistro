Albert Baker d'Isy

Albert Baker d'Isy (b. Paris 18 April 1906, d. 20 May 1968) was a French cycling journalist and author and the founder of the Grand Prix des Nations international time-trial. He is considered, in the French expression, "one of the most beautiful pens" of sports writing. Pierre Chany a contemporary, called him "The best sporting journalist of his generation." 
Biography.
Albert Baker d'Isy worked at "L'Écho des Sports", a sports newspaper which appeared erratically between 1904 and 1957. In 1934, he became one of its main cycling writers, along with René de Latour, who was also foreign correspondent of the British monthly, "Sporting Cyclist". By that time, he was also writing for the larger daily, "Paris-Soir", which he joined in 1931.
With "Paris-Soir"′s sports editor, Gaston Bénac, he created the Critérium National, a road race limited to French riders, and the Grand Prix des Nations.
The Grand Prix began in 1932 to much suspicion among riders, because there had been no tradition of racing against the clock in continental Europe, but the race went on to become the unofficial world time-trial championship. "Paris-Soir" created both races in competition with "L'Auto", the national sports daily which ran the Tour de France. Rivalry between the publications was so intense that Henri Desgrange, the organiser, changed the time of race finishes so to make them too late for "Paris-Soir" to report.
Baker d'Isy and Bénac got the idea of an international time-trial after watching the world championship road race in Copenhagen in 1931, which unusually had been run that way. The two decided that the novelty would ensure their paper publicity and that running a time-trial would cost less than a conventional road race. Baker d'Isy came up with the name and he and René de Latour claim to have found the route. Maurice Archambaud was the first winner. The route started near the Versailles château and ran round a triangle through Rambouillet, Maulette, Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse, Versailles and Boulogne to finish on the Vélodrome Buffalo. There were three hills, one in the first 100 km, plenty of cobbles, and the last 40 km went through the woods of the Vallée de Chevreuse, a popular area for bike riders. The distance was 142 km.
Baker d'Isy moved after World War II to another Paris evening paper, "Ce Soir". He became deputy to Georges Pagnoud in race organisation. Baker d'Isy also wrote for monthly papers, "Sports" and "Miroir", which had been started by the Communist Party.
"Ce Soir" failed and Baker d'Isy joined "L'Équipe", which had taken over from "L'Auto". He was fired from "L'Équipe" after being sent to report from Egypt. Pierre Chany said:
The problem was that Albert always went that bit too far. When he was fired, he had just returned from a long reporting tour of Egypt. He had promised 12 articles but he only ever wrote the first. The paper had announced that the next 11 instalments were to follow, but they never appeared. Baker just wrote 11 titles on a sheet of paper. For the rest, he left a blank page. Out of respect for his readers, Jacques Goddet editor could do nothing else than show him the door.
Baker d'Isy then worked at "France Soir", the last newspaper of his career.
Baker d'Isy was a founder of "Miroir du Cyclisme", writing about champions he had met. A collection of his reports was published as Le Tour de France. "Chroniques de L’Équipe", 1954-1982 (2002, La Table Ronde, Paris).
Pierre Chany wrote of him that he had "a high forehead, a faintly projecting jaw, the dry face of a Breton sailor, a felt hat pushed back to his neck. Cycling was his family and cycling his passion." 
Decline and death.
Baker d'Isy died in 1968 after a life of excess. He once drank a bottle of ink to show he had ink in his veins. He threw it back up on the office carpet. Chany, who told that story, also said:
Albert degenerated his writing. His writing faded. The last papers he submitted didn't have the brilliance that we used to admire. He drank. He slept in the "métro". We tried to help him but he wouldn't be helped and he insulted anyone who tried to alleviate his misery. At the "Courrier de Lyon", a restaurant run by Aimé and Lucette Savy, those wonderful people, they kept an open table. When it wasn't Antoine Blondin it was me or one or two others who used to settle his bill as we passed.
We tried to look after him. I remember that Jacques Couvrat, who started the Super Prestige Pernod, a man who was always very attentive to others, he urged him to write a book. He found him a retreat, a monastery on the bank of the Loire I think, but nothing happened. Albert was stubborn. Albert degerated. One morning, after he'd eaten with me the previous day, he was found stretched out on the pavement in the rue Montmartre. He had no papers on him. He was taken to the Hôtel-Dieu. He died a few months later.

Operation Lilliput

Operation Lilliput (World War II) was the name given to a convoy operation directed by G.H.Q. Operations Instructions Number 21 of 20th October 1942 for transportation of troops, weapons, and supplies in a regular transport service between Milne Bay and Oro Bay, New Guinea between 18 December 1942 and June 1943 in order "to cover reinforcement, supply, and development of the Buna-Gona area upon its anticipated capture" by the United States Army's 32d Division. Within six months, the convoys, escorted by Royal Australian Navy corvettes and largely composed of Dutch KPM merchant ships, had delivered 60,000 tons of supplies and 3,802 troops from Milne Bay to Oro Bay. Corvettes provided the majority of the escort force. Losses during Imperial Japanese air attacks amounted to two merchant ships, and "Van Heemskerk", sunk and two badly damaged while several of the corvettes also sustained damage and casualties.
Oro Bay.
The western terminus of the convoys was Oro Bay some from Milne Bay and noted for its treacherous approaches between Milne Bay and Cape Nelson. The final approach was through a channel from wide and deep. The port area, with a capacity for six to eight ships in an anchorage of about , some from Buna itself, had been used earlier by vessels of the Small Ships Section supporting the campaign. 
On 14 December 1942, an advance party of the Lilliput Task Force arrived with landing barges in advance of the first U.S. Army controlled KPM vessels "Karsik", "Japara" and "Bantam" between 20 and 24 December. Destroyers had been requested as convoy escorts by General Blamey, Commander, Allied Land Forces, but rejected by Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender commanding Allied Naval Forces noting the entire area between Cape Nelson and Buna was so filled with reefs that destroyers would be limited in maneuver and not effective against Japanese forces with clear sea room from bases in Rabaul. Further, requirements preliminary to the Guadalcanal operation required fleet units be on standby south of New Guinea. Thus the convoys would only have small, shallow draft warships for escort. A part of the Buna-Gona general plan was development of a deep water port in Oro Bay with a road to be constructed to an airfield to be developed for logistics and as a bomber base at Dobodura.
Initial landing operations were carried out under cover of night and construction of the of road between the port and Dobodura Airfield was begun by Australian units later augmented by U.S. Army units and equipment with completion within months. In the meantime, jeeps were used over jungle trails to deliver supplies. Over 50 air raids were experienced in the first six months and construction of warves were started in mid 1943 as Operation Lilliput itself was coming to a close, and eight docks, some capable of supporting larger ships, were available by the first of August. After the Lilliput convoys ended, the port was developed into a major facility with machine shops, additional large ship dockage, a slipway of logs capable of handling small vessels and by August 1944 a wooden pier capable of supporting four Liberty ships at once.
Convoy operations.
Operation Lilliput was not an isolated operation as in a single landing or convoy series. It grew from very limited and difficult sea transport in support of the Buna campaign, the very serious lack of supplies for that campaign and had a parallel operation, using some of the same ships over essentially the same route. Convoys of similar nature continued after the formal Operation Lilliput stages had officially ended.
Small Ships Predecessor.
Prior to Lilliput convoy operations, the route had been used, and explored, by the Small Ships Section vessels providing both initial invasion and post invasion logistics support. The route had never been accurately charted and was described by Colonel, later Brigadier General, Thomas B. Wilson, Chief of Transportation, as "the most dangerous coastline in the world" with the pre-war route for Australian vessels avoiding the route in favor of one by way of Rabaul and the Solomon Sea into the north coast of New Guinea. Some 250 Small Ships vessels had been ordered into Milne Bay in October 1942 for support of the Buna area that had previously only been reached by air. These vessels, described as "schooners, motorships, motor launches, cabin cruisers, ketches, trawlers, barges, and miscellaneous vessels, most of which were ancient and rusty. Their Australian crews rigged sails when the engines broke down, and made emergency repairs when the hulls were punctured with bullets or jagged coral" had landed elements of the invasion force and provided logistical support—and "moved at night through uncharted waters, marking reefs with empty oil drums and keeping records of observations and soundings, which were later used in charts" after hiding in rivers by day.
Finding a way.
The initial luggers and small ships "surveying" the route as they carried supplies were later augmented by , the 45 ton former examination vessel at Thursday Island, that began actual surveys to find a reliable approach for larger vessels from Milne Bay to supply troops landed by air near Cape Nelson. In addition to surveys, the vessel was to install lights, land shore parties for reconnaissance, establish radio stations and pilot ships through discovered channels. By the time troops had been airlifted in and secured the area on 5–6 October "Paluma" had completed survey of a route and supplies began to arrive by water. By early November, "Paluma" had found a route for large ships around Cape Nelson whereupon the larger vessels discharged at Porlock with the luggers concentrating on transport forward from there. The hydrographic section in the RAN learned of the local effort and lent assistance with surveys by , and assisting, establishing safe passage for large ships from Milne Bay to Cape Nelson while "Paluma" worked the route forward to Oro Bay by December making the arrival of tanks possible starting on 11 December 1942 aboard "Karsik".
Lilliput.
The urgent need for build up of logistical support and supplies for the campaign and a base for future operations forced risking larger ships in these hazardous waters. In discussions during the first days of November 1942, New Guinea Force Headquarters decided that cargo vessels would be combat loaded in Australia, proceed to Port Moresby, then Milne Bay and then sent in small "flights" with an escort and one or two cargo vessels for the dangerous run to Oro Bay. On 15 November, the first large group left Townsville for Port Moresby with nine vessels escorted by the destroyer and corvettes and . Five cargo vessels and "Arunta" went into Port Moresby with the cargo vessels, "Japara", "Balikpapan", "Bantam" and "J. B. Ashe" escorted by the corvettes going on to Milne Bay for the first run to Buna, but delays in the Buna campaign forced holding of the ships into December with the Port Moresby ships unloading troops and cargo there and returning to Australia. 
The first large vessel to arrive at Oro Bay was "Karsik", escorted by , on the night of 11—12 December 1942 with four Stuart light tanks that were loaded into recently arrived barges and then towed up the coast and landed within miles of the battlefront. "Karsik" then returned on the 14th with a second load of tanks for the forces at Buna. "Karsik"s first trip with tanks to Oro Bay was named "Operation Karsik" and the second as "Operation Tramsik" and immediately preceded the Lilliput convoys. On 18 December, the "Japara" under escort of "Lithgow" departed in the inauguration of the regular Milne Bay to Oro Bay route, arriving on the 20th, that was with few exceptions run with the Dutch vessels. In the end, most of the KPM vessels of the local fleet had been engaged in the operation.
The operation concluded on 17 June 1943 with "Stage 40", when the U.S. Liberty ship "Key Pittman" returned to Milne Bay. After Lilliput's official conclusion on 5 July, six similar convoys were run.
Concurrent with Lilliput was Operation Accountant, the transport of elements of the 162nd Regiment of the United States 41st Division to Buna-Gona, that involved some of the same ships and escorts. Those were the escorts "Ballarat", "Bendigo", "Echuca" and "Kapunda" and the transports "Bontekoe", "Karsik" and "Van Heemskerk".
Vessels.
The Dutch vessels had been acquired through the Netherlands Government in London. Final negotiations between the War Shipping Administration (WSA) and the Dutch government resulted in their being placed under U.S. Army control through a complex charter arrangement in which the British Ministry War Transport (BMWT) chartered the KPM vessels, manned by Dutch officers and Indonesian crew, and jointly with WSA allocated them to the Southwest Pacific Area command's U.S. Army Services of Supply (USASOS) with the stipulation they be under total control of the U.S. Army.
In a footnote, Gill lists the Lilliput vessels as below with the U.S. Army assigned "X" numbers in parenthesis added from Masterson's Appendix 30.
The ships which took part in LILLIPUT were: R.A.N. corvettes—Ballarat, , , , , , , , , , "Katoomba", , "Lithgow", , ; American submarine chasers "SC746" and "SC750"; merchant ships—"Anhui" (X-6), "Balikpapan" (X-28), , "Bontekoe" (X-13), "Both" (X-15), "Hanyang" (X-8), "Janssens" (X-24), "Japara" (X-18), "Karsik" (X-20), "Key Pittman", "Lorinna", "Maatsuyker" (X-12), "Patras" (X-52), "Reijnst" (X-48), " 's Jacob", "Swartenhondt" (X-14), (X-16), "Thedens", "Van den Bosch" (X-23), "Van Heutsz" (X-11), "Van Outhoorn" (X-54), "Van Spilbergen" (X-29), "Van Swoll" (X-50), "Yochow" (X-7).
Ship losses.
" 's Jacob" and her escort "Bendigo" bound for Oro Bay had just passed "Karsik" and "Kapunda" off Porlock Harbour on their return to Milne Bay on 8 March when at one in the afternoon nine Japanese bombers escorted by 12 fighters attacked " 's Jacob". She caught fire and sunk 16 minutes later. Five died and 153 survivors were picked up by "Bendigo" with two of those dying of injuries. Another flight attacked "Karsik" without success.
Bantam was unloading at the Oro Bay wharf on 28 March when 18 bombers and 40 fighters struck the port. Her escort, "Bowen", was on antisubmarine patrol. "Bantam" was hit three times and was beached in a badly damaged state and later declared a loss. In the same raid the U.S. Army bareboat chartered ship "Masaya", an ex-World War I destroyer and banana boat converted as a fast transport, was hit and sunk to the east.
Van Heemskerk is not listed above, but was also part of the original 21 KPM ships joining the SWPA fleet and sunk 14 April 1943. The "Van Heemskerk" and her loss in Milne Bay is noted as the cause for cancellation of one Lilliput convoy. The ship, Stage 28 of Operation Lilliput, was caught in a raid of 30 high altitude bombers, 10 dive bombers and an undetermined number of fighters just after her arrival in the bay and hit by dive bombers to become the last casualty of the operation. Despite efforts of the escort "Wagga", fires could not be controlled and the ship blew up.
Summary.
In the early stages, from December 1942 through February 1943, 12 Dutch ships and eight escorts delivered 40,000 tons of supplies and 2,400 troops in 18 individual voyages. Over the total period into mid-June 1943 with 15 corvettes, two American sub chasers and 24 cargo ships involved, the total became 39 voyages (One cancelled when "Van Heemskerk" was sunk at Milne Bay) transporting 60,000 tons of supplies and 3,802 troops.
Several escorts were damaged and suffered personnel casualties. Three of the ships, all KPM vessels, were lost. Others were damaged in air attacks. The original twenty-one KPM ships that formed the core of the early permanent local fleet of the Southwest Pacific Area's marine logistics had paid a price of one seventh of the original ships.

Frank Prewitt

James Franklin Prewitt (; born January 31, 1949) is an American attorney, government affairs consultant, and a confidential source the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) relied on to help prosecute "PolarPen," the Alaska political corruption probe. Prewitt is the author of "Last Bridge to Nowhere", a fictionalized book that describes his work as a confidential source the FBI relied on to initiate the Alaska political corruption probe that currently is still under way.
Early years.
James Franklin Prewitt, also known as "Frank Prewitt", was born in Berkeley, California on January 31, 1949. He was the youngest of three children born to Catherine and James Prewitt, co-founder of Western Baptist College (now Corban University) in Salem, Oregon. He attended public and international school in the San Francisco bay area and Israel and earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Corban College, a Master of Science degree from the University of Oregon and Juris Doctor degree from the University of Puget Sound School of Law.
During graduate school Frank served as a Trooper with the Oregon State Police (OSP). In his final semester of law school he was appointed legal extern to retired United States District Court Judge James Singleton and during the 1970s and 1980s instructed justice courses as adjunct faculty for Anchorage Community College.
Government service.
In thirteen years of public service to the State of Alaska, Prewitt served as the Director of the Alaska Psychiatric Institute, Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Corrections and Assistant Alaska Attorney General. 
When the State of Alaska’s only Psychiatric Hospital was at risk of losing accreditation, Governor Walter Hickel appointed Prewitt CEO, relying on his “exceptional management skills” to successfully re-organize and re-focus the hospital as a provider of quality inpatient and outpatient mental health services.
Prewitt served under, and at the will of three successive Alaska Governors (Bill Sheffield, Steve Cowper and Walter Hickel). In his final year of public service, editorial writers of Alaska’s largest newspaper twice applauded Commissioner Prewitt for his, “unusually level-headed approach to the high charged issue of crime…when he argues ‘adding police and prosecutors, without giving equal attention to prevention, custody and treatment alternatives may be tough-minded, but it’s also soft-headed and fiscally irresponsible.” 
Private practice.
In 1995 Prewitt established a private consulting and lobbying practice advising and representing human service organizations pursuing business partnership, outsourcing opportunity, funding, statutory and regulatory change with Alaska state and local government. 
From 1998 to 2004 Prewitt was the consulting government affairs and corrections expert for corporate partnerships pursuing construction and operation of private correctional facilities in Alaska, Oregon and Washington. The venture rotated through a succession of corporate principals including Allvest Inc, GEO Group (formerly Wackenhut), Cornell Corrections, Chugach Alaska Corporation (Alaska Native Regional Corporation), VECO Intl Inc, Kenai Native Association, Neeser Construction and the architectural firms of Koonce Pfeffer Bettis and Livingston-Slone.
Combating political corruption.
From 2004 to 2007 Prewitt worked undercover investigations as an FBI confidential source exposing Alaska’s sub-culture of political corruption prosecuting the Alaska political corruption probe. Prewitt provided strategic consultation, covert operations and trial testimony that laid the foundation for the continuing investigation and indictments that have followed (Alaska political corruption probe) In the words of the FBI, “We couldn’t have done it without Frank. His help was absolutely indispensable.” 
On October 10, 2007 the "Anchorage Daily News" reported, "After court on Thursday, prosecutor Joe Bottini took the unusual step of singling out prosecution witness Frank Prewitt, who has been working undercover for the FBI since 2004…his work helped investigators get the evidence they needed for wiretaps and bugs in Suite 604 of (Juneau's) Baranof Hotel. Bottini said that Prewitt has done a ‘tremendous job’ for the government, 'we owe him a lot, frankly.'" 
Two of the early private prisons venture partners were caught up in the ongoing Alaska political corruption probe leading to blogger and press speculation that Prewitt's service to the federal government may have been the result of a secret plea agreement although no formal charges were placed. Prewitt contends his participation with the FBI began after he was cleared. Court documents filed on March 22, 2010 in a criminal appeal indicated that Prewitt had been paid $200,000 for his assistance. 
In the trial of ex-Representative Tom Anderson, Prewitt, a former commissioner for the Alaska Department of Corrections, explained how he was willing to go undercover for the feds to try to ease his own criminal exposure in unrelated investigations.
Criticism.
Under cross examination during the criminal trial of former Alaska Representative Tom Anderson, Prewitt testified that he accepted a $30,000 loan from Bill Weimar in 1994, four months before the end of his term as Commissioner of Corrections. He testified it was a personal loan offered during a family emergency that he gratefully accepted and repaid by providing six months of legal consulting work for Allvest Inc from February 1995 to July 1995. He testified that Bill Weimar had a contract to provide halfway house services to Corrections. Neither the prosecution nor defense offered evidence that the loan was accepted in exchange for official acts, special interest favors, or was related in any way to a specific impropriety. 
Allvest...face(d) two lawsuits that allege its board of directors defrauded plaintiffs in two 2001 court judgments that held the private corporation responsible for wrongful actions. Attorneys Tim Dooley and Brett von Gemmingen...allege that Allvest owner William C. Weimar sold Allvest assets valued at more than $17 million and distributed most of those funds to himself, with the transfer approved by the Allvest board of directors: Weimar, Frank Prewitt and Robert Cronen. "These transfers were made with the intent to evade just obligations," Dooley allege(d) in his lawsuit... Prewitt also acknowledged making an improper campaign contribution in 2002 that could have resulted in a civil fine or written warning if the violation had come to the attention of the Alaska Public Offices Commission. The issue was moot because fines or warnings for Alaska campaign contribution violations can only be issued within twelve months of the alleged violation (Alaska Statutes 15.56.130). The defense used both incidents as an attempt to question Prewitt's motives and believability before the jury. The defense was unsuccessful and on July 9, 2007 Thomas Anderson was convicted on all seven counts of criminal extortion, bribery and money laundering. On October 15, 2007 Anderson was sentenced to five years in federal prison. Weimar subsequently pled guilty to two counts of corruption and was also sentenced to federal prison.

Hans Sommer (composer)

Hans Sommer (20 July 1837 Brunswick – 26 April 1922 Brunswick) was a German composer and mathematician. He was most successful as a composer for the theatre. Several of his operas used librettos based on fairy tales and were first produced at Brunswick: "Der Nachtwächter" (1865), "Loreley" (1891), "Rübezahl und der Sackpfeifer von Neisse" (1904), "Riquet mit dem Schopf" (1907) and "Der Waldschratt "(1912)."Saint Foix", a one-act opera, was given at Munich in 1894 and "Der Meermann at Weimar" in 1896; "Der Vetter aus Bremen" (1865), "Augustin" (1898) and "Münchhausen" (1896–8) were not performed. His incidental music to Hans von Wolzogen's "Das Schloss der Herzen" (1891) was first performed in 1897 in Berlin, in concert form. He placed great importance on the literary quality of his librettos, and corresponded with numerous librettists and composers. His many songs, at one time known in England, include the cycles "Der Rattenfänger von Hameln", "Der wilde Jäger" and "Sapphos Gesänge"; he also wrote orchestral works and male-voice choruses.
Before going into music full-time Sommer, who had studied mathematics and physics in Braunschweig and Göttingen, was also a noted mathematician. He served as the director of the Braunschweig University of Technology, where he taught mathematics, from 1875 to 1881.

JnSynch

jnSynch is a light-weight file synchronization engine written in Java, and released as open source through GPL license.
jnSynch was inspired in rsync and aims to provide an easy way to perform incremental/differential backups that are gentle to computer resources such as CPU usage, memory footprint and network bandwidth usage.
As in PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) toolset, jnSynch can be thought as a Pretty Good Incremental File Sychronization Solution.
It recursively synchronizes a source folder to a target folder. For that, it uses a very simple algorithm of comparing file's "last change date" attribute, between source and target folders, when the attribute is different between source and target, the engine replaces the target file with a fresh copy from the source and updates its "last changed date" attribute to exactly that of the source file.
It was first released to public on September 6, 2008. It is actively hosted in SourceForge.net and code.google.com. It was later scheduled for deletion in code.google.com, so that it is centralized hosted in Sourceforge.Net.

Wright R-540

The Wright R-540 Whirlwind was a series of five-cylinder air-cooled radial aircraft engines built by the Wright Aeronautical division of Curtiss-Wright. These engines had a displacement of 540 in³ (8.85 L) and power ratings of around 165-175 hp (123-130 kW). They were the smallest members of the Wright Whirlwind engine family.
The Wright R-540 should not be confused with the Kinner R-540, a generally similar engine made by Kinner Airplane & Motor Corporation.
Design and development.
Wright introduced the J-6 Whirlwind family in 1928 to replace the nine-cylinder R-790 series. The J-6 family included varieties with five, seven, and nine cylinders. The five-cylinder version was originally known as the J-6 Whirlwind Five, or J-6-5 for short. The U.S. government designated it as the R-540; Wright later adopted this and dropped the J-6 nomenclature.
Like all the members of the J-6 Whirlwind family, the R-540 had larger cylinders than the R-790. The piston stroke of 5.5 in (14.0 cm) was unchanged, but the cylinder bore was expanded to 5.0 in (12.7 cm) from the R-790's bore of 4.5 in (11.4 cm). While the R-790 was naturally aspirated, the R-540, like the other J-6 engines, had a gear-driven supercharger to boost its power output.
Wright gradually refined the R-540, using suffix letters to indicate successive versions. For example, the R-540A had 165 hp (123 kW), while the R-540E of 1931 had power boosted to 175 hp (130 kW) thanks to an improved cylinder head design. Wright sometimes named these versions according to their power, e.g. "Whirlwind 165" or "Whirlwind 175".
License built R-540s.
The engine was built in Spain as the Hispano-Suiza 5Q or Hispano-Wright 5Q without modification apart from the use of Hispano's patented nitriding finishing process.
Operational history.
The R-540 was the smallest, least powerful member of the Whirlwind family and was designed for light aircraft. One of the more popular types to use it was the Curtiss Robin, a light civil utility aircraft. A few were also used in prototype military trainer aircraft that were evaluated by the U.S. Army but not put into production.
The R-540 sold well at first, with over 400 engines being built in 1929. However, with the impact of the Great Depression, sales plummeted, and only about 100 further examples were built over the next eight years. Wright finally ceased production of five-cylinder Whirlwinds in 1937, concentrating on larger engines and leaving the market for small radials to companies like Kinner and Warner.
Since R-540 engines were found solely in light aircraft, they weren't often used for groundbreaking flights. However, there were a couple of noteworthy exceptions which took advantage of the Whirlwind family's reputation for high reliability. In 1935, the brothers Al and Fred Key set a new flight endurance record of 653 hours, 34 minutes in the Curtiss Robin J-1 "Ole Miss", flying over Meridian, Mississippi, from June 4 to July 1. Their plane was refueled and resupplied in flight, and they could perform simple engine maintenance by walking out on a small catwalk extending between the cabin and the engine. Douglas "Wrong-Way" Corrigan's famous unauthorized transatlantic flight from New York City to Dublin, Ireland on July 17–18, 1938, used a Curtiss Robin with an R-540 built from the parts of two used engines.
Engines on display.
Wright R-540 engines on display are uncommon, but there is one at the Strategic Air and Space Museum (formerly the Strategic Air Command Museum) near Ashland, Nebraska.

Ovens &amp; King Football League

History.
The "Ovens & King Football League" was formed on the 13th of June 1903, after a handful of men met at The Bulls Head Hotel in Wangaratta to consider forming a football competition. One week later, the first matches of the Ovens & King Football Association were played. The competition changed its name to the Ovens and King Football League after the 1928 season.
Today, more than 100 years later, teams from Benalla, Bright, Greta, Glenrowan, King Valley, Milawa, Moyhu, North Wangaratta, Tarrawingee and Whorouly participate in seniors, reserves and five netball grades.
Located in the rich Ovens Valley and King Valley of northeast Victoria, the league has produced a number of elite football who have gone on to play in the AFL, including the cousins Nigel (Brisbane Lions) and Matthew Lappin (St Kilda/Carlton), ruckman Mark Porter (Kangaroos/Carlton) and most recently Michael Newton (Melbourne),Barry Hall Sydney/Footscray/Western Bulldogs and Brendan Fevola Carlton and Brisbane Lions.
Community support is strong in the Ovens and King districts with crowds attending games usually greater than most neighbouring competitions. The local football is an important social outlet for many local communities and finals matches draw especially strong crowd numbers.
In 2010, the league added Tatong, Swanpool, Goorambat and Bonnie Doon, who had previously played in the now-defunct Benalla & District Football League. After four years of heavy losses, Swanpool and Tatong were thrown out of the competition by AFL County Victoria, ending nearly 100 years of tradition. A two-way merge proposed by the clubs was rejected, as was a transfer to the Picola District FL.

"Never Let You Go" is a single performed by New Kids on the Block (as "NKOTB") from their 1994 album "Face the Music".

Let's Try It Again

"Let's Try It Again" is by New Kids on the Block. Written and produced by Maurice Starr, it was the fourth and final single from the groups third album, "Step by Step", released in the fall of 1990. It contains shared lead vocals by Danny Wood and Jordan Knight.
Reception.
After having scored their biggest hit with the albums chart topping title track, along with its well-received top 10 follow-up "Tonight," the group would see its momentum slow down in the fall of 1990. Largely blamed on overwhelming media saturation, which included an animated cartoon series during the same period, a growing public and industry backlash against the group began to ensue. Upon the release of "Let's Try It Again," many radio stations rejected the song, while others quickly dropped it from their playlist after a few weeks. As a result, it became groups first single since 1986's "Stop It Girl" that failed to peak within the top 40 in the United States; peaking instead at number fifty-three.

Children of Paradise (song)

"Children of Paradise" / "Gadda-Da-Vida" is a 1980 single by German band Boney M. Intended to be the first single from the group's fifth album "Boonoonoonoos" (originally scheduled for a November 1980 release), the single was ultimately never included because the album release was delayed for one year. "Children of Paradise" peaked at #11 in the German charts whereas it became the group's lowest placing in the UK at #66 only when released in February '81. Boney M. would use the double A-side format in this period, typically with the A1 being the song intended for radio and A2 being more squarely aimed at discos. The sides would usually be switched on the accompanying 12" single.
Children of Paradise.
A synth disco track, based on Moroccan Younes Migri's hit "Lili Twil", "Children of Paradise" went through several try-outs, and Boney M. themselves performed several different versions on various TV shows. The first single versions (with the add for the 5th album on the back cover) had a double chorus after the 2nd verse and then faded during the 3rd verse. The second and final mix had only one chorus after the 2nd and faded after the 3rd chorus. The second single pressings was pressed with an add for "The Magic of Boney M. - 20 Golden Hits" on the back cover since it had been decided the new album needed more time to be completed.
Lead Vocal: Liz Mitchell. Backing Vocals: Liz Mitchell, Marcia Barrett, Frank Farian.
Gadda-Da-Vida.
Although no-one knew at the time it was recorded, "Gadda-Da-Vida" became a controversial Boney M. record since it turned out none of the original members sang on it. Due to a fall-out between producer Frank Farian and the group, he had session singers La Mama (Cathy Bartney, Patricia Shockley and Madeleine Davis) sing the female vocals while he did the deep male vocals as usual. The group only promoted it once on TV. Two different single edits were done of the full 9 minutes version that appeared on the 12" single. "Gadda-Da-Vida" was the A-side in Japan. Only the French release correctly stated the song title as "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida".

Consuela Biaz

"Malaika" / "Consuela Biaz" is a double A-side single by German band Boney M. and the first single taken from their fifth album "Boonoonoonoos" (1981). It peaked at #13 in the German charts, their lowest placing so far after their commercial breakthrough. Boney M. would use the double A-side format in this period, typically with the A1 being the song intended for radio and A2 being more squarely aimed at discos. "Consuela Biaz" was first promoted as the A-side in Germany where the group performed it in pop show Musikladen. After a promotional visit to Spain where the group found "Malaika" had become a Top 10 hit, the title was remixed and then promoted as the A-side. It was the second consecutive Boney M. single not to be released in the UK and Japan.
Malaika.
The original German and Spanish 4:30 single mix featured no percussion ad-libs and most notably, after the second verse it has a key-change to a drum / handclaps / a cappella chant before the song quickly fades. When producer Frank Farian remixed the song for the 12" single and a new 7" edit, he added more percussion and synth and deleted this key-change part and replaced with an outro with himself singing "Wimoweh, wimoweh" (deliberately borrowed from another African tune "The Lion Sleeps Tonight"). 
Lead Vocal: Liz Mitchell. Backing Vocals: Liz Mitchell, Marcia Barrett, Frank Farian, La Mama (Cathy Bartney, Patricia Shockley, Madeleine Davis).
Consuela Biaz.
A ballad story of a fictional character. A slightly different mix appeared on the original pressings, most notably including the line "Tell me, is our dream about to end", sung by Frank Farian just before the second verse. The full remixed second version (5:20) appeared only on the Hungarian 7" single and the French 12" single until it was finally issued on "The Collection" in 2008. A 4:57 edit appeared on most single versions.
Lead Vocal: Liz Mitchell. Backing Vocals: Liz Mitchell, Marcia Barrett, Frank Farian.

Honda Rincon

The Honda Rincon is a model of small all-terrain vehicles manufactured by Honda. There have been two models, launched in 2003 and 2006. The vehicle is designed as a recreational all-terrain vehicle (ATV), rather than a utility or sport version.
Rincon Generation 1 (2003-2005).
Honda introduced the Rincon as their new top-of-the-line ATV using their largest ATV liquid-cooled four-stroke engine. The Rincon was the first ATV to feature an automotive-style automatic 3 speed transmission which shifts either automatically or can be switched to manual mode (called the Electronic Shift Program). 
The vehicles also featured a number of other high end features, some for the first time on Honda ATV, including radial tires, a center hydraulic disc brake system mounted on the rear output shaft, and a fully independent rear suspension system. Also included was Traxlok, enabling riders to switch between 2WD and 4WD modes with a simple thumb-operated switch and a torque-sensing front differential that reduces torque steer for lighter steering effort in 4WD.
Available beginning in 2004 Honda added the GPScape model officially known as the TRX650GPS as an option which adds a built-in GPS unit contained within the instrument cluster assembly. The GPS featured storage for up to 100 waypoints, digital compass function indicating travel direction and an automatic compensating clock.
Rincon Generation 2 (2006-Current).
The Rincon continues as Hondas top-of-the line ATV but starting in 2006 Honda gave the FourTrax Rincon an update in response to customer request. The Rincon 650 became known as the Rincon 680i when the engine size enlarged from 649cc to 675cc. Officially known as the TRX680F and TRX680GPS. Along with the larger engine Electronic Programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI) was introduced. New colors including NaturalGear Camouflage were added.
New features included a rollover sensor to kill the engine in the event the vehicle is partially or fully overturned, front disc brakes, fuel injection, increased power output, improved fuel mileage, elimination of the manual choke and much-easier cold starting, automatic compensation at different altitudes, automatic temperature compensation, a shorter engine warm-up period, and smoother idle.
The manual fuel shut-off petcock was removed, with the PGM-FI an automotive style fuel gauge was added. When the fuel level reaches the E symbol a low-fuel warning light begins to flash letting the rider know that they have about 1.1 gallons of fuel remaining, or enough for approximately 28 miles of reserve range. Battery capacity was increased from 14AH to 18AH.

I Care

I Care is the second studio album by Filipino singer Rachelle Ann Go, released in the Philippines on January 10, 2006 by VIVA Records. The album is an immediate follow-up to her successful self-titled debut album. Its singles include "If You Walk Away", the title track, and "Bakit", a promotional single.
The album was released on digital download through iTunes on June 1, 2005. To date, the album has sold over 15,000 units in the country, certifying Gold by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry.
Background.
After striking it big with four hit singles from her debut album, Go gears for more successes with her second album. Titled "I Care", the album is the result of the tight collaboration of an international line-up of producers, songwriters, arrangers and engineers. Each contribution is meant to showcase the vocal artistry of the 19-year-old "Search for a Star" champion who has now come to her own as one of the country's finest performers.
Go celebrated Christmas 2004 with a Platinum record award for over 30,000 copies sold by her self-titled album. It has since turned double platinum, and has produced the hits "Don't Cry Out Loud", "You and Me (We Wanted It All), a duet with Christian Bautista, "When You Find Your Voice", "From the Start" and "Here I Am Again".
Among her other notable accomplishments this year were her successful solo concert debut in Rachelle Ann Go, the Ultimate Champion which was held at the Aliw Theater on April 29, 2005, and her win as the People's Choice for Favorite Female Artist at the 2005 MTV Pilipinas Music Awards, for her rendition of "Love of My Life". Written and produced by Jay Durias of South Border, the song was included in her first album.
Production and development.
The first single released is "If You Walk Away". Written by Todd Cerney and Skip Adams, the power ballad was produced by Christian De Walden and Carlo Nasi. De Walden, who is one of the top producers in Europe and North and South America, came to the Philippines for the recording sessions at VIVA Entertainment's Amerasian Studios in Quezon City. Along with him came Luca Vittori, one of Italy's leading engineers to record and mix several songs for Go's album.
Aside from the first single, De Walden and Vittori also did the ballad "Baby It's Time" and the dance cuts, "Number One", "Palm Reader", "The Sweetest Vice" and "Good Love". De Walden also produced "Days to Come", but the song was mixed at the Studio di Ripetta in Rome by Vanni G. and David Bacon, two of the hottest DJ's in Italy's trendy club scene.
The title cut, "I Care", was composed and produced by Vehnee Saturno. Saturno gave Go "From the Start", one of the hits from her first album. This was the song that won her the silver prize at the 7th Shanghai Asia Music Festival in 2005, grabbing the Best Composition award in the competition. Last September, Saturno and Go won first prize in the Best Own Country Song category of the Astana Song Festival held in Kazakhstan for her interpretation of Saturno's "Isang Lahi".
Other songs in the album are "Angel", composed by Florian Lormes and Katharina Aliaga Leiva of Germany, and "Thank You", written by singer-composer Yman, both produced by Alwyn Cruz. "It Wasn't Enough" and "Windows of My Heart", a duet with Mark Bautista, were both written and produced by Charles Williams of California. "Bakit", is a composition by actor Chuckie Dreyfus. "Strange Are the Ways of Love" is by Ferdinand Dimadura. A cover of Beverly Craven's "Promise Me" was produced by Eugene Villaluz.
Critical reception.
"I Care" did not perform well enough commercially. Although, it received positive response from OPM critics. Resty Odon of "Titik Pilipino" gave the album four out of five stars, saying "With body proportions hewing close to Beyonce perfection, I am of the opinion that the tectonic shift to sultriness in this album is not ill-advised at all". He liked the dance numbers, calling them as "enlightened move". He praised the first single, saying "'If You Walk Away' pegs Rachelle Ann’s voice between Whitney Houston and Celine Dion". However, he felt that Go's voice did not fit on R&Bs and jazzes like her cover of Julia Fordham's "Promise Me". The review ended with Odon, stating "There’s not a number, though, that borders the category of 'unlikable' in this album [...] so long as she does not overshoot her high-notes limit".

Quartet is the eighth album by Bill Frisell to be released on the Elektra Nonesuch label. It was released in 1996 and features performances by Frisell, Ron Miles, Curtis Fowlkes and Eyvind Kang. Tracks 1, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 12 are from "Tales From the Far Side" (1994), an animated television special created by Gary Larson. Tracks 3 and 13 are from the Italian film "La Scuola" (1995) directed by Daniele Luchetti. Tracks 4 and 10 were written for the Buster Keaton film "Convict 13" (1920).
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars stating "This CD uses a rather unusual instrumentation, a quartet composed of Frisell, trumpeter Ron Miles, trombonist Curtis Fowlkes and Eyvind Kang, who doubles on violin and tuba. Ten of the 13 Frisell originals on the release were originally written for films (including one for Gary Larson, "Tales from the Far Side," and one for a Buster Keaton movie "Convict 13"), and the resulting music is tightly arranged yet spontaneous, episodic, and sometimes a bit nutty, but also strangely logical. Whether it be the old-timey theme to "Dead Ranch," the blues in "Convict 13," a few somber ballads, or hints at early Duke Ellington (particularly by Miles' wah-wah trumpet), this is a continually interesting, offbeat set.".

Released in 2008, the album's first single was a cover of the Harem Scarem song "Honestly", which dominated the charts in the same week it was released. VIVA later announced that her next single was an Aerosmith revival, "Cryin'", but because the single was exclusive to MTV Southeast Asia, VIVA Records instead used her own version of "The Search Is Over". Her third single was a cover of the Amy Grant song, "That's What Love Is For". According to Viva Records, as of November 2008, seven months from its release, the album has already achieved a Gold Record Status for its outstanding sale of more than 12,500.
There were originally 16 tracks in the album, but the three songs were cut, namely "After the Rain" (Nelson), "To Be with You" (Mr. Big), and "Set You Free". The three tracks were later included in the DVD release.

History.
The Rajdhani Express was introduced on 3 March 1969 to provide high-speed connections of up to 140 km/h (87 mi/h) (speed varied depending upon the particular track section) from New Delhi, the national capital, to different state capitals. In a few cases, the Rajdhani also ran to other important locations in the state.
Based the popularity of the Howrah Rajdhani, the Sealdah Rajdhani Express was made functional. Sealdah is another railway station in Kolkata.
Accommodations.
The trains have high priority on the Indian railway network and are fully air-conditioned. Passengers are provided with complimentary meals during the journey. Depending on the timing of the train, lunch, high tea, dinner, morning tea or breakfast are served. The trains offer three classes of accommodation: First Class AC with 2 or 4 berth lockable bedrooms, Second Class AC 2-tier with open system berths (bays of 4 berths + 2 berths on the side) but provided with curtains for privacy & reading lamps, Second Class AC 3-tier (bays of 6 berths + 2 berths on the side) with privacy curtains in some newer coaches. Interestingly, this Rajdhani boasts of the maximum number of AC 2-Tier coaches among any other train of Indian Railways, with 5 AC 2-tier coaches. Generally it has 2 First AC, 5 AC 2-Tiers, up to 10 AC 3-Tiers ( both of which may be increased according to demand), 2 AC Hot Buffet Cars (i.e. Pantry Cars) & 2 Luggage/Parcel cum Generator cum Brake van one of which is provided with the Guards' cabin.
Destinations.
The train is an important link between Kolkata and New Delhi. It runs near some of the most holy sites in India, including Allahabad, Gaya, and Parasnath. It also connects the financial capital of Uttar Pradesh, Kanpur, to Delhi and Kolkata.
The train follows two routes. The train runs the first route, Grand Chord via Gaya, from Monday through Saturday (from Howrah), and the second route, Howrah-Delhi main line via Patna, on Friday.
First route.
The major stops on the first route are:
On this route, the train covers a distance of 1,451 km in 17 hr.

Memorial to Homosexuals Persecuted Under Nazism

The Memorial to Homosexuals persecuted under Nazism in Berlin was opened on 27 May 2008.
Design of memorial.
The Memorial was designed by artists Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset.
The Cuboid is made of concrete. On the front side of the cuboid is a window, through which visitors can see a short film of two kissing men. The work is the third of its kind in Germany following "Frankfurter Engel" (1994) in Frankfurt and "Kölner Rosa Winkel" (1995) in Cologne.
The memorial was discussed by all parties in the Bundestag, which granted permission in 2003.
Near the memorial is a signboard, which is written in German and English. There visitors can read over persecutions during Nazism and under Paragraph 175, the law during the 1950s and 1960s that outlawed homosexuality. It was reformed in 1969, attenuated in 1973 and finally voided in 1994.
History of memorial.
The homosexual victims of Nazism were not officially recognized after 1945. During the 1950s and 1960s, Paragraph 175 was still part of the German penal code. 
In the 1980s, these "forgotten victims" were finally discussed. In 1985, for instance, president Richard von Weizsäcker remembered homosexuals as a "victim group". 
The group "Der homosexuellen NS-Opfer gedenken" and the organization "Lesben- und Schwulenverband" began promoting a memorial in Berlin in 1993.
On 12 December 2003, the Bundestag approved the erection of a memorial in Berlin at the boundary of Tiergarten (near the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe). Then the competition for artists started.
Politicians attending the 27 May 2008 dedication included Berlin's Mayor Klaus Wowereit, President of the Bundestag Wolfgang Thierse, German Culture Minister Bernd Neumann, Volker Beck and Renate Künast. Mayor Wowereit gave the opening speech for the memorial. Following its dedication, it was frequently vandalized that year.
Controversies.
After the competition for an artist, which Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset won, a discussion was held regarding the video, specifically whether to include lesbians kissing. Lesbians victimized under Nazism have not been documented, though there are instances recorded of lesbian pubs in cities like Berlin which were lost. The feminist magazine EMMA protested that the memorial should also be for persecuted lesbian women. As result of the discussion, the video will be changed every two years and will also show kissing lesbians.
In 2008, the Holocaust survivor and historian Israel Gutman questioned its location near the Jewish Holocaust Memorial in Berlin. "The location was particularly poorly chosen for this monument," Gutman told Polish newspaper "Rzeczpospolita". "If visitors have the impression that there was not a great difference between the suffering of Jews and those of homosexuals – exclusively German – it's a scandal." He explained that the German people "understood the immense scope of the crime of the Holocaust which they had committed, but this time, they made an error," because "a sense of proportion must be maintained."

Roger Craig (baseball)

Roger Lee Craig (born February 17, 1930) is a former pitcher, coach and manager in Major League Baseball.
Playing career.
During an 12-year playing career, Craig won 10 or more games in , , and . A master at the split-finger fastball, Craig started his career with the Brooklyn Dodgers, and closed out his career with the Philadelphia Phillies. Craig was the starting pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game One of the 1959 World Series, a series in which he also started Game Four. Craig was also the starting pitcher for one game apiece in the 1955 and 1956 World Series with the Brooklyn Dodgers, and he also pitched in relief in two World Series games for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1964, winning one game. Craig's overall World Series record was two wins and two losses, and his teams won three of the four series. 
Craig was perhaps best known after that as a player for being an original 1962 New York Met (actually, a 1962 – 63 Met), and for losing the first game in team history, 11–4 in St. Louis. (It has been erroneously believed that he gave up the first run in New York Mets history on a balk; although he did commit a balk in the first inning, he already trailed 1–0, and the balk was not a scoring play.) He was a stalwart of the legendarily bad team's pitching staff, finishing 10 - 24 and 5 - 22 games in those first two murderous seasons. (The Mets lost 120 games in 1962.) In 1963, Craig suffered through a personal 18-game losing streak as a pitcher. Remarkably, during those two seasons, he pitched 27 complete games, while winning a total of only 15, demonstrating that he was one of the best pitchers on the staff. 
During the 1962 and 1963 seasons, when Roger Craig lost 24 and 22 games respectively, the New York Mets played all of their home games at the antiquated Polo Grounds stadium, the former home of the New York Giants baseball team.
Managerial career.
From 1986 to 1992, Craig was the manager of the San Francisco Giants. In Craig's first five full seasons with the Giants 1986–1990, they never finished with a losing record. Prior to coming to San Francisco, Craig served as a pitching coach for the 1984 World Champion Detroit Tigers and as manager of the San Diego Padres (the Tigers' opponent in the 1984 World Series) from 1978–1979. From –, he had become one of the better-known pitching coaches in Major League Baseball, working for the Padres (1969–1972; 1976–1978), Houston Astros (1974–1975) and Tigers (1980–1984), with a knack for teaching the split-finger fastball to his charges.
Under Craig (who along the way, instituted the unique motto and rallying cry "Humm Baby") the Giants won the National League Western Division title in 1987. The original term of "Humm Baby" was given to the roster's third catcher for the 1986 season, Brad Gulden, who was on his way out of baseball but he managed to squeeze onto the roster for the 1986 season. Craig felt that Gulden didn't really have the talent but he had the heart so he called him the "Humm Baby". The Giants' divisional title in 1987 came just two years after they lost 100 games; Roger Craig replaced Jim Davenport as manager for the final 18 games of the 1985 season (posting a 6–12 record). The Giants came within one game of going to the World Series that year, losing to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. 
In 1989 the Giants won their first National League pennant since 1962 by defeating the Chicago Cubs in five games in the NLCS. Craig's Giants were swept in four games by the Oakland Athletics in the World Series, which was interrupted by an earthquake.
Roger Craig stepped down from the San Francisco Giants in 1992 after posting a 72–90 record. His successor, Dusty Baker, won 103 games the following year and won the National League Manager of the Year Award.

<doc id="19228342" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19228342" title="Amsterdam University College">
Amsterdam University College

Amsterdam University College (AUC) is a public liberal arts college in the Netherlands with an enrolment of about 750 students from more than 60 countries. All teaching is in English.
The college was founded in 2009 as a joint initiative of the VU University Amsterdam and the University of Amsterdam with a particular focus on the natural sciences. Although AUC has its own campus, students can also use facilities of both parent universities. The college is part of a recent wave of university colleges in the Netherlands which have introduced liberal arts education to the country.
AUC offers Bachelor of Arts degrees in the social sciences and humanities and a Bachelor of Science degree in science, which are pursued by about 50%, 15%, and 33% of the student body, respectively. The curriculum is strongly interdisciplinary; within each field, students have to pursue at least two disciplines. AUC further emphasizes its 'academic core', which makes up a large part of the curriculum.
History.
The foundation of AUC goes back to an initiative of the two large universities in Amsterdam, University of Amsterdam (UvA) and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU), as well as the municipality. It is part of an initiative to make Amsterdam a hub for research and development in the natural sciences.
AUC was officially founded in 2008, and took up operation with its founding class in 2009. The first dean of the college is Prof. Dr. Marijk van der Wende, Professor of Higher Education at the VU. The first class of graduates received their diplomas in 2012.
Academics.
Reputation.
In the 2013 Nationale Studentenenquête (NSE), AUC scored an average of 3.84 out of 5 points. While this made AUC one of the best bachelor programs at the University of Amsterdam, this meant the second-lowest rank among university colleges.
Students at Amsterdam University College receive a joint degree from the University of Amsterdam and the VU University, both of which consistently rank among the best universities in the Netherlands. The University of Amsterdam regularly places among the best 100 universities in the world (2013 QS World University Rankings: 58).
Academic programme.
AUC offers a three-year honours degree in three very broad majors in science, social sciences, and humanities. During the academic year 2013/14, students could choose between approximately 200 courses across eight fields in the sciences, nine in the social sciences, seven in the humanities, as well as the academic core. As part of AUC's interdisciplinary orientation, students have to pursue 'tracks' in at least two fields within their major. Interdisciplinarity is also emphasized by AUC's themes, which link fields across majors.
The college emphasizes a strong academic core, which includes academic writing and basic calculus or statistics, but also more unusual courses such as logic or 'identity and diversity', which are compulsory for students of all majors. Furthermore, students are required to take two to three language courses; in 2013/14, the languages offered were Arabic, Dutch, French, German, and Spanish.
AUC has branded itself as a 'science college', and places particular emphasis on the natural sciences. In 2013/14, courses were offered in eight 'tracks': information sciences, mathematics, physics, earth and environmental sciences, chemistry, biology, biomedical sciences, and health. Although during the first years less than 35% of students were majoring in the sciences, this number is expected to rise to 50% in the future.
While teachers for many core and introductory courses are employed by AUC directly, the college draws on its parent institutions for most of its lecturers.
Graduates receive a joint degree from VU University and University of Amsterdam; a Bachelor of Arts in the social sciences or humanities or a Bachelor of Science in science. Students graduation with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher receive an honours degree. Cum laude degrees are awarded for graduation with a GPA of 3.5 or higher, and summa cum laude degrees for a 3.9 or higher.
Study Abroad.
Around a third of all students spend a semester abroad during their studies at AUC. The college has a number of partners on its own, but students can also apply to the exchange partners of UvA and VU on all continents. AUC students generally fare well in university-wide applications, and popular destinations include the University of Toronto and McGill University in Canada, Boston College in the USA, the National University of Singapore, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the University of Melbourne in Australia. In return, AUC receives a somewhat smaller number of exchange students from it own and university-wide partners.
Admissions.
In 2010, AUC admitted 200 of about 900 applicants for its class of 2013. The average grade of admitted students in the Dutch system was 7.6, the highest of all Dutch university colleges that publish such information. About 15% of students obtained an International Baccalaureate, with an average GPA of 5.4. Enrollment is projected to gradually increase to 900 students, and in 2012, AUC for the first time admitted 300 students for the class of 2015.
Unusually for a European public university, AUC's application procedure includes an individual essay, motivation letter, and interview. In a country where access to most courses of study is unrestricted, this gives the college unusual freedoms to select its students. AUC in particular takes into account international experience.
Tuition and Scholarships.
As of the academic year of 2012/13, the tuition fee amounts to 3,901 Euro for Dutch and EU/EEA students and 11,491 Euro for all other international students.
The law "ruim baan voor talent", passed in 2011, allows some public universities to ask higher tuition fees from their students. For programs that offer services beyond regular standards, universities are allowed to charge more than the regular tuition fees (1771 Euro in 2012/13). AUC has been awarded the "Distinctive feature of small-scale and intensive education" by the Dutch-Flemish Accreditation Council (NVAO) required under the law.
Scholarship Fund.
About 15% of students are supported by the AUC scholarship fund. The fund awards full scholarships of 5,000 Euro for Dutch/EU/EEA and 15,000 Euro for international students, as well as partial scholarships up to half the amount. In addition, the Diversity Award Programme of the AUC scholarship fund provides scholarships specifically for Dutch minority students, with the aim to increase the diversity of the student body.
The AUC Scholarship Fund is supported by VU, UvA, and the Amsterdam University College Student Association; as well as a range of corporate sponsors. The latter include Rabobank, Royal Dutch Shell, Schiphol Group, Akzo Nobel, KLM, and PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Accreditation.
The AUC programme is a fully accredited joint bachelor programme of the VU University Amsterdam and the University of Amsterdam (UvA). The Dutch government allocates responsibility for accreditation to the NVAO (the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders). The AUC programme was accredited by the NVAO on 2 September 2008. Upon successful completion of the programme students receive a joint Bachelor honours degree from the VU University Amsterdam and University of Amsterdam (UvA) and the title Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc).
AUC has been awarded the "Distinctive feature of small-scale and intensive education" by the Dutch-Flemish Accreditation Council (NVAO), which is required from Dutch institutes of higher education for raising tuition fees beyond the national standard.
Campus and Location.
AUC is a residential college with a campus in the Science Park Amsterdam. It is located in the borough of Amsterdam-Oost, in what was formerly the borough of Watergraafsmeer. The campus houses an academic building, completed in 2012, and student residences managed by the student housing cooperation DUWO.
Academic Building.
AUC has a main academic building in the Science Park, where most classes are taught. In line with AUC's promise of small classes, the building does not have an auditorium; larger events take place in its common room area. Lecture rooms and study areas are spread over four levels, and teacher's rooms are notably located in areas accessible to students.
The AUC academic building, opened in 2012, was designed by Mecanoo architects. Its exterior appearance is dominated by a façade of rust-coloured steel plates. The interior design received praise in the media for its "open character". The building won the 2013 Amsterdam Architecture Prize, for "the simplicity of its shape its surprising interior. A variety of different types of space with a range of educational functions meet, connect and merge under one substantial roof, which is spectacular and yet unobtrusive."
The architecture of the academic building emphasises environmental sustainability. The roof is planted with grass, increasing isolation and acting as a water storeroom. In combination with a geothermal heat pump, this serves to minimise energy loss and consumption.
Before moving to its current location, for the first three years of its existence AUC had a temporary academic building in the Plantage quarter, associated with the Roeterseiland location of the University of Amsterdam and opposite of the city's zoo, Artis.
Student Residences.
Students are required to maintain residence on campus for the whole duration of their studies. The student dorms are located on the Science Park campus in close proximity to AUC's academic building. The dorm buildings are administered by Dutch student housing specialist DUWO.
Science Park.
The Science Park Amsterdam was initiated in 1996 as the location for a cluster of university buildings, research institutes and businesses. Next to AUC, the area also houses the University of Amsterdam Faculty of Sciences and several research institutes for physics, computer science, and mathematics. With two colocations of the Amsterdam Internet Exchange at the institutes SARA and NIKHEF, the Science Park Amsterdam is one of the major Internet hubs in Europe.
The Amsterdam Science Park railway station connects the area to Amsterdam Central Station and Schiphol Airport in one direction and Almere in the other. A bus line connects the Science Park to Muiderpoort and Amstel railway stations.
Student Life.
As a small residential college, AUC has a close-knit student community. Parts of campus life are organised by student committees, although many activities take place in an informal framework. In particular Dutch students of AUC also participate in student organisations off campus, including fraternities at the University of Amsterdam and the traditional student rowing clubs, Nereus and Skøll.
Student Body.
AUC annually admits 300 students, most of whom join for the fall semester; though spring admission is possible. At the beginning of the year of 2013/14, enrollment was at about 750 students.
About 40% of student at Amsterdam University College come from abroad, roughly as many as come from the Netherlands (minority and foreign-educated Dutch students excluded). International students hail from more than 60 countries, though most are citizens of the European Union. In addition, in 2012/13, 12% of AUC students had a Dutch minority background. AUC has stated its aim to raise the minority population to 20% by means of scholarships and increased outreach to high schools.
Clubs and Organisations.
Student activities at AUC are organised under the umbrella of the Amsterdam University College Student Association (AUCSA). The Student Association derives its budget from an annual membership fee collected via tuition payments. Funds are used to support independently run student committees.
In 2013-14, there were 22 recognised student committees. These included groups dedicated to Model United Nations (AIMUN), sports (AISA), arts, sustainability (ASUSA), debating, gardening, volunteerism (Hands On), music (MAPS), yoga and mediation, performing arts (On Stage), cinema (Screen), and parties and events (Solace); as well as the publications Scriptus and InPrint, and the yearbook.
Student Politics.
Until the academic year 2012/13, students were represented by the elected five-member Student Council responsible for administrative matters, as well as three non-elected student members (alongside three faculty members) on the Board of Studies, with an advisory function on academic matters. As of 2012/13, Student Council and Board of Studies have undergone an experimental merger, forming a College Council with five representatives of student body and faculty each. A further student representative on the Board of AUC fulfills a non-voting supervisory function.
Alumni.
Many alumni of Amsterdam University College go on to pursue graduate studies both in the Netherlands and abroad. Alumni of Amsterdam University College's first graduating class in 2012 have gone on to pursue postgraduate studies at universities including the University of Oxford, the London School of Economics, University College London, King's College London, the University of Edinburgh, Columbia University, Beijing University, Uppsala University, and TU Delft; while others have remained associated with the parent institutions University of Amsterdam and VU Amsterdam. Alumni of the class of 2013 are now attending, next to the international universities named above, the Sciences Po Paris, HEC Paris, University of Cambridge, University of Geneva, University of Freiburg, and University of Lund.
Based on their studies at Amsterdam University College, alumni have won scholarships including from the UK Research Councils, the VSB Fonds, and the Amsterdam Merit Scholarship.

Baby Boom Galaxy

The Baby Boom Galaxy is a starburst galaxy located 12.2 billion light years away. Discovered by NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology, the galaxy is notable for being the new record holder for the brightest starburst galaxy in the very distant universe, with brightness being a measure of its extreme star-formation rate. The Baby Boom Galaxy has been nicknamed "the extreme stellar machine" because it is seen producing stars at a surprising rate of up to 4,000 per year. The Milky Way galaxy in which Earth resides turns out an average of just 10 stars per year.
Discovery.
The Baby Boom Galaxy was discovered and characterized in 2008 using a suite of telescopes operating at different wavelengths. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and Japan's Subaru Telescope, atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii, first spotted the galaxy in visible-light images, where it appeared as an inconspicuous smudge due to its great distance. It wasn't until the Spitzer and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, also on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, observed the galaxy at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths, respectively, that the galaxy was formally discovered.
Strange behavior.
The Baby Boom Galaxy is so named because it generates over 4,000 stars per year (compared to an average of just 10 per year for the Milky Way). At that rate, the galaxy needs only 50 million years to grow into an equivalent of the most massive galaxy ever observed. The discovery also challenges the accepted model for galaxy formation, which has most galaxies slowly bulking up by absorbing pieces of other galaxies, rather than growing internally. Another unusual aspect is the fact that scientists are observing this galaxy at a time when the universe was only a little over 1.4 billion years old, meaning that this galaxy was exhibiting this strange behaviour while the universe was still in its infancy.
"This galaxy is undergoing a major baby boom, producing most of its stars all at once," said Peter Capak of NASA's Spitzer Science Center. "If our human population was produced in a similar boom, then almost all of the people alive today would be the same age."
To that, the principal investigator of the Cosmic Evolution Surveyor, Nick Scoville of Caltech responded:
"We may be witnessing, for the first time, the formation of one of the most massive elliptical galaxies in the universe."

Melbourne is a city in south-eastern Australia. Most major lakes are used for recreational purposes, mostly sailing, rowing, canoeing and kayaking, but some are used for activities like water skiing or swimming. Melbourne hosts a number of major water catchment reservoirs that supply the city's water as well as many smaller reservoirs or retarding basins used either for water supply or storm water drainage.
The Yarra River hosts many small lakes and billabongs, particularly through its middle reaches, many of which are not named and are not included here. This article does not include lakes and reservoirs outside of the Greater Melbourne area, for information on other lakes in Victoria see the List of reservoirs and dams in Australia.

Jost Metzler

Jost Metzler (26 February 1909—29 September 1975) was a "Korvettenkapitän" with the "Kriegsmarine" during World War II, commander of the U-boats and , and recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.
Career.
Metzler joined the "Kriegsmarine" in October 1933, after spending eight years in the merchant marine. He served on the torpedo boat "T-196" and on several minesweepers. After 13 patrols on the minesweeper "Grille", he transferred to the U-boat arm in April 1940, commissioning in November 1940.
On his first patrol, sailing from Kiel to St. Nazaire in early 1941, he sank three ships for a total of 18,576 tons. On his second patrol south-west of Iceland, he sank a single ship of 3,759 tons and damaged another. Metzler's third patrol on "U-69" was the most successful. He laid 16 mines in the harbour of Lagos, Nigeria, where they later sank a British steamer. He then sank another five ships for a total of 25,544 tons.
Metzler developed renal colic a few days after leaving St. Nazaire on his fourth patrol in August 1941, forcing the U-boat to return to port. After two months in hospital he served as the leading training officer in "25th" and "27th U-boat Flotilla" until February 1943.
Metzler commanded from February to June 1943 without sailing on any patrols, and was appointed temporary locum commander of "5th U-boat Flotilla" for two months before serving as commander of "19th U-boat Flotilla" from October 1943 until the end of war.
In 1954 Metzler published a memoir "The Laughing Cow: The Story of U-69". The title is derived from the time when "U-69" was first assigned to "7th U-boat Flotilla" and the crew were instructed to paint Günther Prien's snorting bull insignia on the U-boat's conning tower. No illustration was enclosed, so "U-69"s First Watch Officer, "Oberleutnant zur See" Hans-Jürgen Auffermann instructed a shipyard worker to copy the head of laughing cow which appeared on the packaging of a popular French dairy product instead. This naturally proved to be a source of great amusement.
Summary of career.
Ships attacked.
As a U-boat commander of Jost Metzler is credited with the sinking of ten ships for a total of , further damaging one ship of and damaging one ship of so severely that it had to be considered a total loss.

The Four Faces of Nuclear Terrorism is a 2004 book by Charles D. Ferguson and William C. Potter (with Amy Sands, Leonard S. Spector and Fred L.

The authors argue that these "four faces" of nuclear terrorism are real threats which U.S. policy has failed to take into account.

Similar to the previous Food for Friends event, the actual in-game items were used as a conversion rate to real-world goods which were donated to the Po Leung Kuk residential child care unit.

Global in-game events.
On January 16, 2010, Sanrio Digital announced Food For Friends 2, the charity-driven in-game event to raise donations for charitable causes. The mechanics were similar to the previous Food For Friends, with players from North America, Singapore, Malaysia and Europe invited to participate. During the 10-day event, players from the various regions donated in-game items which were converted to US$18,038.30, the donations being delivered to Doctors Without Borders in response to the earthquake in Haiti.
A new event, "Chocolate Harbor Rescue", was released on September 9, 2010. During the event, players accumulate points which be used to calculate a charitable contribution as follows:
Game play.
Combat is secondary in "HKO" with focus on resource collecting and crafting. Several different locales based on, and named after, cities such as Beijing, Paris, London, Tokyo, and New York are present as well wholly original and explorable areas.
All players are represented by customizable human avatars. Available options during character creation include gender, hairstyle, eyes, skin tone, face and even blood type.
Combat, though not the primary focus of the game, is still relevant. Weapons take the form of various blunt implements such as brooms, flyswatters and microphone stands. Players enter combat by right-clicking on a nearby monster, at which point the avatar and the monster will begin to exchange blows. Monsters don't die in "HKO", but when their health bar is fully depleted they become dizzy, pass out and are defeated, allowing players to loot them.
Resource Collection Skills.
In the majority of MMORPGs players receive experience points and level increments by defeating opponents and completing quests; this is not the case in "HKO", where players level-up primarily through resource collection and item crafting.
Collecting resources is an important aspect of "HKO" because many items found in the game are obtained by crafting or purchasing from NPC vendors. Crafted items are generally superior to items bought from NPC vendors. Players must have the appropriate ingredients and/or resources in their inventory if they wish to craft.
Resource collection has four subtypes of skill: woodcutting, gathering, planting and mining. Players must choose a primary and a secondary skill from these four subtypes. A character's chosen skills can reach much higher levels than skills not chosen. Since higher-level resources require a higher corresponding level, players are encouraged to trade amongst each other for resources. In order to gather resources players must equip a resource gathering tool such as a pick-axe and click on an available resource node. Resource tools have level requirements in respective skills (e.g., an advanced pick-axe would require a higher level in the mining skill).
Item Crafting.
Item crafting is a key feature of "Hello Kitty Online" and, like resource collection, is divided into four skill subtypes: Cooking (food items that replenish health, energy or both); Tools/Weapons, Clothes (like weapons, clothes need to be created by the players themselves but can be traded to other players) and Furniture.
Farming.
Each player receives a starter farm upon entering the game for the first time. The farm serves as the primary form of income in the game. Crops grown on the farm can be sold, traded to other players, or crafted into different items. Players can also purchase bigger and nicer (and pricier) farms. Successful farming requires players to take into consideration variables such as land fertility, pests and growth factors. If you don't water your farm frequently, the plants will dry out and die. But be aware that there are moles that sometimes come to farms to eat your plants.
Pet System.
Every defeated monster in "HKO" has a chance of dropping a rare pet card that can be used to gain that monster's service, effectively making that monster a player's pet. Players may own a maximum of 3 pets in total, and only one pet can be used at any time. Pets have a variety of roles: they can act as mules, providing extra inventory space; some pets provide a buff to player stats while they are in service; lastly, they are able to help when it comes to collecting resources. Pets gain levels from food: when pets are fed regularly, their stats and level will increase over time.
Player versus Player (PvP).
"Hello Kitty Online" contains no direct PvP, though players may choose to compete amongst themselves in a number of available minigames.
Minigames.
Minigames available in-game and in SanrioTown web site member's area provide players a chance to compete with each other.
Housing System.
Each player's farm has an allotted space on which the farm's owner can build a house. In order to build a house, players require a land certificate, which can be bought from an NPC or received as a quest reward. Construction can begin after sufficient amounts of the required resources have been accumulated. There is a variety of different houses; the more elaborate and extravagant, the more expensive.
Once a house is completed, players can furnish the interiors with different appliances, furniture and interior elements such as wallpapers and floorboards.
Socializing.
"HKO" advocates the concept of "social networking". Players can view other players' blogs, send email, and watch uploaded videos from in-game or on the SanrioTown web site.
Players can also band together to form a guild. Guildmates can help each other build to speed up the construction of houses. Group Quests will be available in the future updates to the game.
Community.
The design of "Hello Kitty Online" emphasizes the use of the game and SanrioTown web site as a social community platform. A number of social features found on SanrioTown were integrated directly into the game client, and HKO players are able to access SanrioTown's video sharing service, blogs and emails with a hellokitty.com address. Players can also participate in the discussions posted on the community forums.
The official HKO website includes a wiki, nicknamed Kittypedia by forum users, which players can edit to include updated information about the game. The wiki discusses pets, items, NPCs, guilds, and other aspects of the game. A fanmade wiki can also be found on Wikia, but it typically has more outdated information, as it isn't edited as often. 
Item Mall.
The "Item Mall" will be located both on the SanrioTown website and will also be accessible while playing the game. At the "Item Mall" players will purchase premium items including unique clothes, pets, weapons and house designs. Purchases will require "Sanrio Loyalty Points" (which are gained from using SanrioTown services such as blogs), and "Sanrio Cash Points" (which are purchased using real money). Another method is paying money in exchange for points using game cards.
Reception.
"Hello Kitty Online" Closed Beta garnered mixed, though mostly positive, reactions from the media and players. "Noctalis.com" called it "a cloyingly sweet pink-filled wonderland of talking animals set to a chirpy soundtrack". The game's sprite-based and isometric perspective 2.5D graphics were criticized as 10-year old technology, and the lack of customization options for each character (e.g. dye kits or ways to change the color of the home items) was noted.
IGN's hands-on review of the Closed Beta was largely favorable, concluding:
With the SanrioTown blog feature, gamers were able to share their experiences while playing the game. The players were also responsible for helping out the newbies with their blog and video tutorials. Generally, players found other players and the HKO staff to be pleasant and helpful, citing the "HKO" environment as a breather from the "griefing" and PvP-confrontations that affect most online games.
House building was found to be difficult and players complained that they had to ask their guild mates to help.
"Hello Kitty Online"'s Closed Beta was praised for being largely free of bugs; the help and support provided by the developers was praised by players as swift and earnest, and it was considered a remarkable achievement by one reviewer.
A post on the Outblaze Blog dated February 15, 2008 summarized several online reactions to the closed beta announcement, and included humorous comments from influential game blog Kotaku, ValleyWag, InventorSpot, Japanator, and others.
While the game was generally positively received, many players became frustrated with the lack of attention to the game by its developers and a large portion quit the game. An increasing number of the remaining players, however, are attempting to encourage new players to join the game and old ones to return as well as attempting to contact the developers.
HKO Insider.
On April 1, 2008, the "World of Warcraft" news and strategy web site WoW Insider announced that it would no longer cover "World of Warcraft", but would switch to "Hello Kitty Online". The banner that originally read "WoW Insider" was replaced with one that read "HKO Insider", with images of Hello Kitty on both ends. WoW Insider's April 1 content consisted exclusively of satirical articles (at least 26 of them) based on Hello Kitty Online. In the 28th article to be posted to the web site, an announcement was made that the site would revert to WoW Insider.
Island Adventure Pack.
On April 1, 2008, Sanrio Digital issued an April Fools' Day announcement revealing the first Hello Kitty Online expansion pack, entitled "Island Adventure", was scheduled for release in 2009. The news was posted on the main SanrioTown blog as well as the official "HKO" blog. The title of the fictional expansion pack is a reference to the "South Park" episode "Make Love Not Warcraft". in which the character Butters Stotch states that he prefers "Hello Kitty Island Adventure" to more violent and competitive games such as "World of Warcraft".
According to Sanrio Digital's April Fools' release: 
The fake news was used as material for a humorous article on WoW Insider.
Award.
Hello Kitty Online was awarded a "Best Digital Entertainment Award" for the 2008 Hong Kong ICT Awards.

Elmenteita Badlands

The Elementeita Badlands, also known as the Otutu Forest or Ututu Forest, is a lava flow in Kenya that covers approximately . The area was previously covered in thick dryland forest characterized by cedar trees, ("Juniperus" spp.), and Leleshwa bushes ("Tarchonanthus camphoratus"). In addition, Wild Jasmine and Boophone are also found.
The land belongs to Njenga Karume, who bought it from Arthur Cole in 1980. Cole had bought it from Digby Tatham-Warter (famous for his role in the Battle of Arnhem) in 1968, as grazing land of low potential. The land is unsuitable for either small scale cultivation or cattle ranching as it is covered in thick bush growing from the profusion of lava boulders.
Geography.
The land is punctuated by pyroclastic cones of Holocene age. The highest peak has an elevation of 2126 metres. It is located between Lake Elmenteita and Ol Doinyo Eburru volcano, on the southern boundary of the Soysambu Conservancy. Some of the prominent peaks include "Horseshoe Crater" and "Scout Hat Hill". There are some lava tube caves which show evidence of prehistoric occupation as grinding plates and stone bowls have been recovered by the local people in rudimentary excavation. These caves have been occupied by some of the refugees from the 2008 post-election violence in Kenya.
People in the Elmenteita Badlands.
The area was heavily degraded from the 1980s onwards, being a hideout for disaffected and dienfranchised people who have resorted to charcoal burning, poaching and changaa brewing. A trading centre has been built at the northeastern corner known as "Soko Mjinga" (Fool's Market) which is the place to trade in these items.
The living conditions in the Otutu forest have led to an outbreak of leishmaniasis or Aleppo boil which is spread by sandflies and rock hyrax, which are numerous there. The only sources of water are from some small steam vents beside the old railway line along the eastern boundary of the forest (currently a road), which ran between Elmenteita and Gilgil before it was realigned in 1945. The Eburru station (now defunct) is on the edge of the Otutu and is notable for the steam condensers made from oil drums and corrugated iron sheets which the residents construct for their water source.
A luxury tourist lodge, called Mawe Mbili Lodge, is currently under construction on the western boundary of the forest, on the slopes of "Scout Hat Hill", so called because the shape resembles Baden Powell's hat. It is projected to open in March 2009. The water supply is from rainwater caught from plastic sheeting and from a deep and alkaline borehole which provides water at over 50 degrees Celsius and a pH of nearly 8.

Nakkeerar

Nakkeerar is a medieval Tamil poet from Madurai. He is renowned for his most famous work Tirumurukarruppatai. He was also the author of another work called "Iraiyanar Akapporul". He must not to be confused with an earlier Nakkirar from 250 AD, who had also composed some very fine anthologies like Nedu-nal-vadai in Sangam literature.
He is one of the prominent characters in the epic "Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam". The Thiruvilaiyadal episodes of Sundareswarer's (Lord Shiva's) confrontation with Nakkeerar is enacted as a part of the Meenakshi Sundareswarer Temple festival traditions in Madurai.
Personal life.
Nakkeerar was born in a family of chank-cutters. It is not known when Nakkeerar had lived but it is widely assumed that he lived in the 9th century AD during the Sangam period. According to broad consensus among historians and scholars, the hero of the epic "PandiKovai" was the Pandyan king Nedumaran who lived between 675 and 750 AD. Since Nakkirar was a contemporary of Nedumaran, they have concluded that he must have lived around the 8th century AD.
Confrontation with Lord Shiva.
The "Tiruvilaiyadal Puranam" relates an incident involving Nakkeerar's confrontation with Lord Shiva. Once the Pandiyan king had a doubt as to whether the scent from a woman's hair was natural or artificial. He announced a prize of 1000 gold coins for anyone to resove his doubt. A poor poet named Tharumi prayed to Lord Shiva to make him get the award. The Lord gave a poem to the poet and asked him to take it to the King. When this poem was read in the court, Poet Nakkeerar found fault with it and stopped the Pandiyan king from giving the prize. Tharumi's grief grew and he again appealed to the Lord. He said he was not worried for not receiving the prize but he could not bear anyone finding fault with the Lord's poems. 
Thereupon, Lord Shiva himself came to the court and challenged Nakkeerar. But Nakkeerar was not moved. Though Lord Shiva asked him if the hair of Ganapoongodai, the consort of Lord Kalathinathar, whom Nakkeerar worshipped,did not have a natural scent,the undaunted Nakkeerar asserted that it was so. Shiva opened the eye in his forehead (Netrikkan) which emitted fire and looked at Nakkeerar to show the poet who he was. Even then, Nakkeerar persisted in his statement. As he could not bear the scorching heat emanating from the divine eye he jumped into the water of the Golden Lotus Tank. Then at the request of the other poets, the Lord took Nakkeerar out of the tank, forgave him and made him study under 'Agasthiar', the Tamil Sage. This story remains a popular myth.
Works.
Nakkeerar is the author of an epic titled "Sriharnipuram" which he composed at the behest of Kulachirai Nayanar, the Prime Minister of the Pandya king Gunapandiyan. He also composed a hymn "Tirumurukarruppatai" that praises Thiruparankundram, an important shrine to Lord Murugan.
Cultural references.
The episode involving Nakkeerar and the Hindu god Shiva was depicted in the Tamil film "Thiruvilaiyadal" which was based on the stories of the "Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam". The role of Nakkeerar was played by the director of the movie A. P. Nagarajan himself. The scenes featuring Nakkeerar and Lord Shiva (Sivaji Ganesan) are iconic and famous in the history of cinema.

Cash-for-votes scandal

The cash-for-votes scandal is a scandal in which the United Progressive Alliance, the majority-holding parliamentary-party alliance of India led by Sonia Gandhi, allegedly bribed Bhartiya Janta Party MPs in order to survive a confidence vote on 22 July 2008. The vote in the Lok Sabha arose after the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Front withdrew support from the government, who wanted to pursue an Indo-US nuclear deal.
Events and allegations.
The CPI(M) objected to a proposal that would see the United States supply nuclear technology to India in return for India agreeing to United Nations inspections of its nuclear programs and the splitting of the civil and military aspects of those programs. CPI(M) believed that this would cause India to be effectively subservient to the US. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also objected, on the grounds that the inspections could impede development of the country's nuclear arms program. The vote was won by the government in the face of the predominantly left-wing and Hindu nationalist objections. It had been arguing that the nuclear infrastructure needed to be developed more rapidly because the existing electric generation facilities were incapable of meeting growing demand.
The government's success in the 2008 confidence vote was marred when three BJP MPs, including Ashok Argal, waved bundles of cash which they produced from bags in parliament during the debate, accusing the government of giving it to them in order to buy their support or abstention in the vote. The BJP demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the allegations and claimed that they had video evidence of the deals being made, while the CPI(M) leader said that "Practically every member of parliament has been approached with offers of money and inducements." The government denied the allegations, pointing out that Argal would have self-incriminated himself by admitting to receiving a bribe. The Speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, asked New Delhi's police chief to investigate.
A fortnight later, on 2 August, the BJP offered "documentary evidence" to support its allegation that Argal, Faggan Singh Kulaste and Mahaveer Bhagora had been bribed. The evidence included transcripts of video recordings and explanatory letters from two of the MPs, all of which was passed to the investigatory committee that had been set up by parliament. The BJP also criticised CNN-IBN, who had recorded the BJP MP's attempt to sting the government but had not broadcast it.
The tapes were broadcast on 12 August 2008 after CNN-IBN had made its appearance before the investigating committee. The company had resisted the calls for an earlier broadcast on the grounds of legal opinion that it had not yet attended the committee and that the broadcast might prejudice the investigatory process.
The parliamentary investigation began on 30 July 2008 and has frequently been referred to as the Kishore Chandra Deo committee. The committee reported in December 2008 that it had found no evidence of bribery in the case of Rajya Sabha members Amar Singh and Ahmad Patel. They had been accused of offering the bribes, and Singh was a prominent member of the Samajwadi Party (SP) which had begun to support the government at the time when the Left Front moved to oppose it. The committee also recommended further investigation into the activities of Sanjeev Saxena, Sohail Hindustani and Sudheendra Kulkarni. Saxena was an aide to Amar Singh, Kulkarni had a similar role for the BJP leader, L. K. Advani and Hindustani was a Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha activist (although some early reports say that he was a driver). Some committee members distanced themselves from the report's full conclusions but agreed that the additional investigation was needed. The report concluded that the video evidence relating to a car at Singh's house was insufficient proof: it was not possible to determine who was in the car and "It does not prove what transpired inside the house. There is nothing to show that money was offered for voting in favour of the motion of confidence or for abstaining from voting."
A police investigation was instigated in January 2009 to look into the issues relating to Saxena, Hindustani and Kulkarni which had been recommended in the report of the parliamentary committee.
In his autobiography "Drohkaal ka Pathik", released in November 2013, former MP Pappu Yadav alleged that during the July 2008 trust vote, both the Congress and BJP had offered "Rs 40 crore each" to MPs of his Indian Federal Democratic Party, for their support.
Reports of evidence.
Revelations by WikiLeaks.
The Congress Party had worked to support the government in the vote and on 17 March 2011 WikiLeaks claimed that Nachiketa Kapur, a Congress Party political aide, had boasted to US Embassy officials in July 2008 that his party had funds to bribe MPs in order to obtain a favourable outcome. Kapur claimed that four MPs who were members of Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) had already been paid off. "The Hindu" reported that 
Former United States Ambassador to India David Campbell Mulford commented that US diplomatic cables were "generally accurate" but that all he could recall of the incident was that someone "turned out with a suitcase of money and dumped it on the table ... That was clear theatrics." In denying any wrongdoing, the RLD pointed out that they only had three MPs at the time, not four as stated in the leaked cable. Satish Sharma, who was the person for whom Kapur acted as an aide according to the cable, said that he had no aide at all.
The revelations led immediately to further calls for the resignation of Manmohan Singh and also for an investigation of the activities of Kapur and Sharma. There were also calls for the issue of a First Information Report (FIR), which is the formal means by which the police record their notification of an offence.
It was announced on the following day, 18 March, that the police investigation into the original allegations was near to completion.
Tehelka expose.
"Tehelka", a sometimes controversial publication that specialises in exposés, reported that the entire affair was a BJP set-up designed to entrap members of the government. The report was based on an account given by Siddharth Gautam, a CNN-IBN reporter who had been involved, and on some recordings of telephone conversations that had not previously been made available.
Supreme Court involvement.
An application was made to the Supreme Court on 2 April requesting that it ordered a Special Investigation Team to probe the affair. The applicants were a group calling themselves the India Rejuvenation Initiative and they argued that the investigatory process had stalled since the report of the parliamentary committee. The hearing was adjourned to due a procedural irregularity in the application, and when this was resolved on 2 May the Court issued notices to the Delhi police and government that required them to provide information regarding the current status of the investigation. The petitioners said that 
On 7 July the Court voiced its frustration with the continued absence of the requested status reports and set a filing deadline of 15 July. The police had requested a further two months to fulfil the request. Upon being presented with the status report, the Court criticised the lethargy of the police investigation, complaining that little had been done and that which had been done was poorly documented, inconsistent and in places factually incorrect.
The court was similarly disparaging of a second report which followed on from a burst of activity by the police. On 5 August 2011, Justice Loda said 
Arrests.
Saxena was arrested on 17 July, two days after the police had been criticised by the Court. The police claimed to have sufficient evidence to prove that he had delivered money to the three BJP MPs and alleged that he had misled both their enquiry and that of parliament. They also announced that they had interviewed Bhahora and Kulaste, who were no longer MPs, but that their ability to interview Argal was hampered because he was still in office. They had applied to the Home Ministry for permission to interview him and Amar Singh, still a member of the Rajya Sabha, and further announced that they intended to re-interview Hindustani. The developments caused Deo to clarify that his committee had not absolved Singh of any involvement but rather that it had found no evidence to confirm involvement. He also had to explain that the decision not to interview Singh had been because the committee had no "prima facie" evidence of Singh's involvement, the summonsing process for a Rajya Sabha member would have been complex, and the outcome may have still been a failure to attend as Singh was not obliged to do so. Furthermore, he stated, the dissenting members of the committee had agreed with its conclusions but had disagreed with his chairmanship. Deo had become a cabinet minister on 12 July.
Hindustani was arrested on 20 July and announced that he would be repeating his previous statements that he had been approached by Singh and some members of the Congress Party who had wanted him to "arrange" BJP votes. The police described him as the "orchestrator" and explained that he was working for the BJP in an attempt to entrap the government, but his defence counsel has claimed that he was just a "whistleblower" and that as such he should not have been the primary focus of police attention. The BJP took a similar line to defence counsel, claiming that the investigation was an "eyewash", querying how police lethargy had turned so quickly and suggesting that they were being put under pressure by the government.
Singh was interviewed on 22 July and on the same day the police announced that they wished to speak with SP MP Rewati Raman Singh, whom the BJP MPs alleged had approached them on behalf of Amar Singh. On the same day, the Court ordered that Hindustani and Saxena should be detained in custody for 14 days, despite defence arguments of police misconduct. The defence claimed that the police had not interviewed Hindustani and therefore had no new evidence upon which to base their recent claims of orchestration. When the police stated that interviews had taken place the defence counsel responded by noting that they had not been present for any such interviews and that their presence was a legal requirement. The detentions were subsequently extended to 18 August.
Despite Amar Singh having previously fallen out with his party's leadership and being expelled from the party, Mulayam Singh, the leader of the SP, voiced his support for the ex-member on 24 July and claimed that Amar Singh had been framed. Rewati Raman Singh and Argal were interviewed by police on the following day, with Singh claiming that he gave them the same details as he had previously given to the investigatory committee, and Argal claiming that in fact Singh had approached him in relation to facilitating the alleged bribe. Kulkarni was interviewed on 14 July.
Amar Singh was arrested on 6 September for his alleged involvement in the scam and was ordered to be remanded in custody until 19 September. He had appealed to the court to exempt him from appearing personally, stating that he was ill with an infection; however, his request was rejected.
On 22 November 2013, a Delhi court accepted the statements of Amar Singh and three BJP men - Faggan Singh Kulaste, Ashok Argal and Mahabir Singh Bhagora - that their actions had been as whistleblowers. Saxena will still stand trial under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

Lank Leonard

Frank E. Leonard (January 2, 1896 – August 1, 1970), better known as Lank Leonard, was an American cartoonist artist who created the long-running comic strip "Mickey Finn", which he drew for more than three decades.
Biography.
Early life and career.
Born in Port Chester, New York in 1896, Leonard decided early in his childhood that he wanted to be a cartoonist while he made copies of "Buster Brown", "Happy Hooligan", "Little Nemo" and "The Katzenjammer Kids", eventually creating his own characters. In high school, he was the art editor of his school newspaper.
After his high school graduation, Leonard took a job as a bookkeeper at a local factory, where he also drew cartoons for the plant's house organ. He studied at a business college from 1914 to 1915, then served in the U.S. Army during World War I.
Returning from the service, Leonard designed a new type of suction sole basketball shoe for a sporting goods firm, which eventually hired him as a salesman. He was in his early twenties, working as a traveling salesman, when he met cartoonist Clare A. Briggs on a train between Sioux City and Omaha and showed him the sketch pad he always carried. "Pretty crude, but there's no doubt you have talent," said Briggs.
Briggs referred him to "Chicago Tribune" editorial cartoonist Carey Orr, who suggested Leonard take the C. L. Evans correspondence course in cartooning. Leonard did so, mailing in assignments drawn in hotel rooms as he traveled about the country. Later, he took night courses at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and New York's Art Students League.
In the spring of 1925, Leonard left his salesman job and started working full time as a cartoonist. As an inker at the Bray Productions animation studio, he took home a salary of $11 a week. He then drew sports cartoons for a baseball magazine, then spent nine years doing a sports cartoon feature for the George Matthew Adams Syndicate and writing about sports, while also selling sports cartoons to "The New York Telegram" and "The New York Sun". Weighing in at 200 pounds and towering over six feet, the lanky Leonard also played semi-pro basketball.
"Mickey Finn".
In 1936, the McNaught Syndicate bought his comic strip "Mickey Finn" about the family life of an Irish-American policeman. From the start, the strip was calculated to show the good qualities of human nature rather than the sordid side of crime.
Appearing in more than 300 newspapers at the height of its success, the strip continued under Leonard for the next three decades, assisted by Mart Bailey and Morris Weiss with lettering by Tony DiPreta. Leonard also did a topper strip, "Nippie: He's Often Wrong!", which ran beneath the Sunday "Mickey Finn". Nippie was a child who ignored warnings in order to do things his way and suffered the consequences.
The character of Mickey Finn was inspired by Leonard's observations of Port Chester policeman Mickey Brennan. Other characters in "Mickey Finn" were drawn from Lank Leonard's own family, and the model for Mickey Finn was Leonard himself. Mickey's mother was based on numerous sketches of Leonard's mother, and his real-life Uncle Phil inspired the comic strip Uncle Phil. Kitty Kelly, Mickey's fiancée, was modeled on Florence McLaughlin, whom Leonard married in June 1939.
After World War II, Leonard began working in Miami, Florida, during the winter months, and in 1950, he bought a split-level home in Miami Shores, spending ten months of the year there, drawing and playing golf.
On Saturday, March 10, 1951, at his new Miami Shores home, he hosted a gathering of cartoonists. Attending the party were Colin Allen, Frank Beck, Wally Bishop ("Muggs and Skeeter"), Dick Briefer, Al Fagley, Quin Hall, Bill Holman, Fred Lasswell, Al Posen, Zack Mosley, Leonard Sansone, Chuck Thorndyke, Burt Whitman and Elmer Woggon.
In 1951, Leonard and Bishop left Florida for Washington's Carlton Hotel, where they joined other members of the National Cartoonists Society for breakfast on November 6 with Harry Truman. Gathered in Washington to help the Treasury Department sell Defense Stamps, the group presented Truman with a bound volume of their comic strip characters, some interacting with caricatures of Truman.
In the early 1960s, Leonard let Weiss take over the writing of the strip. Leonard died in 1970, two years after retiring. Lank and Florence Leonard had two children, Jim and Nancy. Jim was born in 1956. Daughter Nancy attended Salve Regina College in Newport, Rhode Island.

Calgary Co-op

Calgary Co-operative Association Limited (commonly referred to as Calgary Co-op) is a retail cooperative operating in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
History.
Opened in the 1940s as a food store operated by the United Farmers of Alberta in Calgary and eventually changing hands to the Alberta Co-operative Wholesale Association (ACWA) in 1951, the Calgary Co-operative Association was founded to operate the Calgary food store independently of the ACWA, partially due to member dissatisfaction with how the ACWA managed the venture. The Calgary Co-operative association purchased the Calgary store from ACWA in 1956 for $58,000.
Present Operations.
Calgary Co-op is member-owned, and is one of the largest retail co-operatives in North America. With over 900,000 members, 3,500 employees, assets of $457 million and annual sales over $1.1 billion, Calgary Co-op is committed to lead in food; petroleum; home health care; pharmacy; wine, spirits, beer and travel. Calgary Co-op supports numerous not-for-profit and charitable organizations in Calgary (through the Co-op Community Foundation) by investing over $4 million into the local community each year.

Ralph Hale Mottram

Ralph Hale Mottram (30 October 1883 – 16 April 1971) was an English writer, known as a novelist, particularly for the Spanish Farm books, and as a war poet of World War I.
His father was the chief clerk of Gurney's Bank in Norwich and Mottram had an idyllic childhood growing up in 'Bank House' - a magnificent George II mansion on Bank Plain - which was later Barclay's Bank and is now a youth centre. The Mottrams were non-conformist and worshipped at the Octagon Chapel, Norwich in Colegate.
Mottram went from being a bank clerk in Norwich before the war to becoming lord mayor there in 1953. "The Spanish Farm" won the 1924 Hawthornden Prize. He also wrote a biography of John Galsworthy.
He was a defender (i.e., a conservationist) of Mousehold Heath - a large open space in the heart of Norwich. On St. James' Hill, there is a sculpture, dedicated to him, which depicts the skyline of Norwich.
He is buried in the non-denominational Rosary Cemetery, Norwich. Being a non-member of the established Church of England, Mottram once said that 'I knew, when I was four years old, exactly where I could be buried.'

Tolaasin

Tolaasin secretion by 'Pseudomonas tolaasii' is the cause of bacterial brown blotch disease of edible
mushrooms. Tolaasin is a 1985 Da lipodepsipeptide non-host specific toxin. In addition to forming an amphipathic left handed alpha-helix in a hydrophobic environment, the toxin has been shown to form Zn2+-sensitive voltage-gated ion channels in planar lipid bilayers and to catalyse erythrocyte lysis by a colloid osmotic mechanism. At high concentrations, tolaasin acts as a detergent that is able to directly dissolve eukaryotic membranes.

HMS Doris (1808)

HMS "Doris" was a 36-gun fifth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy that served between 1808 and 1829. She was the second ship of the Royal Navy to be named after the mythical Greek sea nymphe Doris.
"Doris" was built for the Royal Navy in the East India Company Dockyard in Bombay in 1807. She was launched as "Salsette", and was renamed locally as "Pitt" later that year. However because the Royal Navy already had an HMS "Pitt" in service, the Admiralty renamed her again as HMS "Doris". 
HMS "Doris" initially saw service in the Malacca Straits and the South China Sea, and was involved in the Mauritius campaign of 1810, and the invasion of Java in 1811. Put in reserve in 1815, she was recommissioned in 1821 and served two tours of duty on the South America station during the Chilean and Brazilian wars of independence and the Brazil-Argentine war 1826-8. 
During her 21 years in the Royal Navy she had eight captains. One of them was Barrington Reynolds, who commanded her for a short period in 1812, between his commands of HMS "Sir Francis Drake" and HMS "Bucephalus". Another was Thomas Graham, who died en route to Chile in 1822, with his wife, the travel writer Maria Graham, on board.
By the late 1820s, decayed timbers in her bow made her unfit for further service, and she was sold at Valparaiso in April 1829.

<doc id="19228944" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19228944" title="Cardanol">
Cardanol

Cardanol is a phenolic lipid obtained from anacardic acid, the main component of cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL), a byproduct of cashew nut processing. Cardanol finds use in the chemical industry in resins, coatings, frictional materials, and surfactants used as pigment dispersants for water-based inks. It is used to make phenalkamines, which are used as curing agents for the durable epoxy coatings used on concrete floors. The name of the substance is derived by contraction from the genus "Anacardium", which includes the cashew tree, "Anacardium occidentale". The name of the genus itself is based on the Greek word for "heart".
Friction particles are made by polymerizing the unsaturated side chain of cardanol, followed by cross-polymerization with formaldehyde to yield a cardanol-formaldehyde resin by a process analogous to the formation of phenol-formaldehyde resins such as Bakelite. Cardanol-phenol resins were developed in the 1920s by Mortimer T. Harvey, then a student at Columbia University. These resins found use in vehicle brakes after it was found that they had a coefficient of friction that was less sensitive to temperature changes than phenol-formaldehyde resins.
Despite all these uses, only a fraction of the cardanol obtained from cashew nut processing is used in the industrial field. Therefore, there is still interest in developing new applications, such as new polymers.
The name "cardanol" is used for the decarboxylated derivatives obtained by thermal decomposition of any of the naturally occurring anacardic acids. This includes more than one compound because the composition of the side chain varies in its degree of unsaturation. Tri-unsaturated cardanol, the major component (41%) is shown below. The remaining cardanol is 34% mono-unsaturated, 22% bi-unsaturated, and 2% saturated.
In terms of physical properties, cardanol is comparable to nonylphenol. Cardanol is hydrophobic and remains flexible and liquid at very low temperatures; its freezing point is below −20 °C, it has a density of 0.930 g/mL, and boils at 225 °C under reduced pressure (10 mmHg). CAS registry number: 37330-39-5.

History.
The traditional story of the formation of the village is that Bais Rajput came from Raibareli and had fight with bhar, and after next generation there were Five Brothers, Khulua, Semara, Anurudhpur, Dhourahara and Machhalipatti, who become five villages, and these five villages known for the Brave Bais Rajput in Estern UP. Being situated on the bank of river Ganges, people are also of holy minded. There is no evidence as to how old is this village. It has given many freedom fighters to India.
Geography.
Khulua is located at . It has an average elevation of 80 metres (265 feet).
Commerce.
The main business of this villagers is Agriculture, but there are people working in both the Government and Private sectors. People work in MNC companies, whilst carpet manufacturing is the secend largest employer and villagers go to Khamaria to do carpet work. All the villagers have their fields (Khet) so they do not need to buy wheat, rice, potatos and other daily staples.
The UP Government plan for the Ganges expressway from Greater Noida to Balia will cover many of the fields in the village. The government claim that it will bring prosperity, but the villagers doubt this.
Residence.
Khulua is a traditional Indian village, rulled by Rajput from the beginning. Brahmin were given respect by the Rajputs but they misused this and started to consume alcohal and meat. The Caste System continues to persist in this village. It can be easily observed during conflict situation, election wave, festival springs. The caste hierarchy continues as Kshatriya, Brahmin, OBC (Yadav, Pasi, Kumhar, Muslim) and Schedule caste(Chamar, Mushahar).
Education.
Availability of primary and secondary education institution is major achievement of this tiny village. Government has set up primary school. It also has private school for primary education. There is a girls school for higher secondary education. An intermediate college for boys is also established with the help of villagers. Currently more than 2000 students are enrolled in this school from other neighbouring regions.
Vindhyachal.
A few miles away from this village is a site of pilgrimage to Hindus known as Vindhyachal where according to the mythology a part of Sati (an Avatar of Durga) fell. The river Ganges flows through this village. Other sites of pilgrimage include Kali Khoh (literally 'the cave of the Goddess Kali') where a statue of the Kali has a mouth formed in the shape of a cave, hence the name.

Turnford and Cheshunt Pits

The Turnford and Cheshunt Pits is a Site of Special Scientific Interest in the English counties of Hertfordshire and Essex and covers a total of 428.17 acres (173.28 ha). 
Location.
Most of the site is owned by Lee Valley Regional Park Authority and managed as the River Lee Country Park. The site is bounded to the west by Cheshunt and Turnford and Fishers Green and Holyfield to the east. 
Description.
The SSSI includes ten former gravel pits, part of the Small River Lea, a further waterbody, Hall Marsh Scrape, which was constructed specifically for use by waterfowl. Also included in the site are areas of marsh, grassland, ruderal herbs, scrubland and woodland. 
The pits which include North Metropolitan Pit known as Northmetpit was excavated in the 1940s to Hooks Marsh Lake which was dug in the 1970s and cover a span of over 40 years. 
The site are of national importance for the wintering gadwall and the wintering Northern shoveler and of regional importance for wintering coot and locally important for wintering snipe and the bittern. Breeding bird species of local importance include the great crested grebe, tufted duck, coot, little ringed plover, sedge warbler and the reed warbler. 
Many species of aquatic invertebrates have been recorded from the site especially damselflies and dragonflies including the scarce hairy dragonfly which has bred on the site and the red eyed damselfly is found in abundance. 
The various pits support varied aquatic and marinal flora including the nationally scarce whorled water milfoil. Other species include the fan- leaved water crowfoot, flowering rush, lesser reedmace, frogbit, blunt-leaved pondweed, lesser pondweed and the brown sedge. 
Many of the spits and islands have developed into areas of scrubland and woodland mostly of willow species and alder. To the west of the North Metropoitan pit is the Nightingale wood. This large block of woodland provides roosting and feeding sites for wintering and migratory passerine birds. The nationally scarce musk beetle Aromia moschata is also present in these areas. 
Several pits have developed marsh and rank grassland, their principal value is for invertebrates, particularly an area close to Bowyer's Water where grasshoppers and bush-crickets are present. This orthopteran fauna is believed to be the richest in Hertfordshire and includes several species more associated with coastal sites, such as the lesser marsh grasshopper and the nationally scarce roesel's bush-cricket. 
Several areas of former gravel pit have been infilled with power station pulverised fuel ash, much of which was transported to the site by barge via the River Lee Navigation. Much of the reclaimed land is poorly drained and exerts a strong calcareous influence on the vegetation. The area supports some of the largest colonies of marsh orchid in Essex and Hertfordshire. Other orchids present in large numbers are the early marsh orchid and southern marsh orchid, also present in smaller numbers are the common spotted orchid and various hybrids between these species. 
To the north of the site at Turnford Pit North, are a number of small areas of grassland believed to represent relics of the habitat which preceded gravel extraction. These fragments of agriculturally unimproved grassland are of a dry, rather calcareous, type which is rarely found in a river valley. Plant species which are present here include the cowslip, wild carrot and the common centaury. 
The site also supports a wide range of mammals, reptiles and amphibians: including otter, harvest mice and a large population of grass snake. 
Public access.
The nearest station Cheshunt railway station. Car parking is available adjacent to the site. Cycling and pedestrian access via the Lea Valley Walk. Much of the site can be visited by the network of public footpaths and cycle tracks.

Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People

Signature (previously the The Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People or CACDP) is a charity in the whose aim is to improve communication between deaf and hearing people in the United Kingdom. Signature offers a portfolio of qualifications in British Sign Language and other forms of communication with deaf and deafblind people.
Qualification portfolio.
All of Signature's qualifications are accredited by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) and appear on the National Vocational Qualification framework. Signature Qualifications are available at centres across the UK.
The full list of Signature qualifications is as follows:
BSL/ISL
Deaf Awareness/Issues
Vision.
The collective vision of Signature is one of an inclusive society where deaf people experience no communication barriers. In its 25 years the charity has raised awareness and promoted skills, and standards, in the languages and communication methods that deaf people use.
Signature have overcome many obstacles to become the recognised professional registration body for interpreters, lipspeakers, speech-to-text-reporters and others providing language access services, and one of the top awarding bodies in the UK.
Deaf people are still excluded, overlooked and discriminated against in our society. There are far too few professionals offering language access services. CACDP know too few schools teach BSL or even tactics for communicating with deaf people. We know far too few people are formally qualified to teach BSL. Signature's work remains as important now as it was on the day the charity was established.
Signature exists to provide knowledge and recognise skills in the languages and communication methods used by deaf people. Over twenty-five years Signature has been highly successful, more than 280,000 candidates have entered for assessments and the number of professionals registered to offer language access services has grown to over 600. Signature's work has also had an appreciable effect on public policy and service provision helping to shift the emphasis from a paternalistic welfare model to one based on rights and inclusion.
Signature has been privileged to contribute to several important developments in their sector. Every Sign Language Interpreter, Lipspeaker and Speech-to-text reporter now working in courts and police stations must be Signature registered. Projects to improve inclusion for deaf people in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales backed by the devolved administrations are in various states of development and delivery. The report on access to communication in English for deaf people has raised awareness of the access issues for the greatest number of deaf people.
Until 2009 Signature was known by the name CACDP.

Jost de Negker

Jost de Negker (c. 1485–1544) was a cutter of woodcuts and also a printer and publisher of prints during the early 16th century, mostly in Augsburg, Germany. He was a leading "formschneider" or blockcutter of his day, but always to the design of an artist. He is "closely tied to the evolution of the fine woodcut in Northern Europe". For Adam von Bartsch, although he did not usually design or draw, the quality of his work, along with that of Hans Lützelburger and Hieronymus Andreae, was such that he should be considered as an artist. Some prints where the designer is unknown are described as by de Negker, but it is assumed there was an artist who drew the design, although it has been suggested that de Negker might fill in a landscape background to a drawing of a figure.
Born in Antwerp c.1485, he worked as a cutter in the Netherlands to 1508, when a print he cut by Lucas van Leyden was published. He probably moved in that year to Augsburg (certainly before 1512) and worked for Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor on his print projects, as well as cutting blocks from designs by Hans Burgkmair the Elder and others. He was probably not used by Burgkmair in 1508 on his first chiaroscuro woodcut, for which precise cutting was essential to align the multiple blocks, but was working with him by 1510 on later works. Later states (in effect editions) of Burgkmair's two earliest chiaroscuro woodcuts, the equestrian portraits of "Saint George" and the "Emperor Maximilian on horseback", and other Burgkmair prints, carry Negker's name and sometimes address, suggesting he owned the blocks, and was acting as publisher, though it is now thought that he may not have cut the earliest ones himself. 
In 1512 de Negker wrote a long letter to the Emperor, in itself an indication of his status, which among other things makes it clear that he had been working on Maximilian's projects for some time, and had two assistants, paid via himself. As Maximilian's programme expanded, the signatures of eight different cutters are found on the reverse of blocks (surviving in the Albertina, Vienna) from 1516–18, including that of the other great cutter of the period, Hans Lützelburger. Negker still seems to have been the co-ordinator of the cutting side of the projects, though Albrecht Dürer brought in his own man, the difficult Hieronymus Andreae, for the Triumphal Arch. Giulia Bartrum says that the "Imperial commissions enabled the block-cutter and printer Jost de Negker to raise the status of his profession to an unprecedentedly high level."
On Maximilian's death in 1519, the large teams assembled for his projects dispersed, and de Negker became as much a publisher as a cutter, retaining many blocks by Burgkmair, Hans Weiditz and others, and pirating many works such as the "Dance of Death" by Holbein, Lützelburger's masterpiece as a cutter. Negker's edition of this was published in 1544, and is his last known work. 
The cutters of most "single-leaf" woodcuts (prints) produced at the period are unknown, as they were usually only credited on the printed piece if they also acted as publisher, or at least printer. If the original block has survived these may be marked or signed, as they normally were in the case of Maximilian's projects, to ensure the right cutter was paid from the large teams. In the absence of other evidence, it is not usually worthwhile to speculate on the identity of a cutter based on style or quality, so many single prints cut by Negker during these years probably remain untraceable in the large production of the period. With books there is more evidence, from title-pages. He is attributed with the cutting of the German chiaroscuro woodcut with the largest number of different colour blocks, a seven-block coat of arms by Hans Weiditz (1520) used as a book frontispiece. 
Jost de Negker's business was continued until at least the mid 1560s by his son David de Negker, who inherited his blocks and after leaving Augsburg also worked in Leipzig and Vienna. Another (presumed) son, Samson, also cut blocks.

The Sail and Steam Navy List

The Sail and Steam Navy List: All the Ships of the Royal Navy 1815–1889 by Rif Winfield and David Lyon is a historical reference work providing details of all recorded ships in commission or intended to serve in the Royal Navy from 1815 to 1889. Where available in Admiralty records (from which all the data is sourced), it gives the location of construction, dates of construction (ordering, keel laying, launch and commissioning), principal dimensions and tonnage, armament, machinery (for steam vessels) and fate of every ship of the Royal Navy over the period.
David Lyon's "The Sailing Navy List: All the Ships of the Royal Navy, Built, Purchased and Captured, 1688-1860" had been published in 1993, a ground-breaking study of the sailing vessels of the Royal Navy from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until the close of the Age of Sail. He had planned a follow-up on the ships of the Royal Navy in the era of transition from sail to steam power, and began work in preparation for that volume. Sadly, this was cut short by his death in a diving accident during 2000 in the Bahamas (he was an enthusiastic underwater archaeologist).
Shortly after his death, his colleague Rif Winfield, author of the best-selling "Fifty Gun Ship", and subsequently the author of a series of volumes under the heading "British Warships in the Age of Sail", took over David's accumulated notes, added them to his own extensive research on Royal Naval warships, and carried on this work to produce what the "Journal for Maritime Research" described as 
The book is a valuable reference work and the only complete single-volume published record for ships of the late Georgian era (1714-1837) and of the early (1837-1860) and middle (1860-1889) Victorian Royal Navy. Rif Winfield's subsequent three-volume "British Warships in the Age of Sail" series has expanded this material to incorporate all vessels of the British (before 1704, English) Navy between 1603 and 1817, and incorporated the results of extra research since the publication of their "Sail and Steam Navy List".

St Mary's Church, St Mary's is a parish church in the Church of England located in Hugh Town, St Mary's, Isles of Scilly, UK. The Church was consecrated on 7 September 1838 and replaced the church at Old Town which was inconvenient for the Hugh Town population and in need of repair.
History.
Augustus Smith although not an architect designed the church and according to a letter, penned by himself to the secretary of the Duchy of Cornwall was very pleased with his architectural skill. Smith laid the foundation stone on 31 October 1836, on a site at the eastern end of Hugh Town on high ground between Carn Thomas and Buzza Hill. Vyvyan (1960) describes the building as ° "... bold rather than pleasing, plain rather than ornate, characteristics which mark the interior also"″. King William IV granted £1,500 towards its erection, it was completed in August 1838 and was consecrated on 7 September 1838. The proposed inscription for the church, according to a memorandum in Smith's handwriting was to be ″"This Church was erected by the munificence of His Majesty, King William the Fourth, a lasting memorial of his zeal and of his paternal regard for the inhabitants of these Islands".° It actually reads ″"In the year of our Lord, 1837, this Church was erected by the munificence of His Majesty King William IV. The same was completed at the expense of Augustus Smith, Esq"″.
The interior contains the coloured and gilded wooden lion from the flagship of Sir Cloudesley Shovell, wrecked in 1707. Outside the church are two lead water cisterns dating from 1727. The church was repaired by Corfield (C. Russell and Son), Architects of Falmouth between 1979 and 1980.
Bells.
The peal of eight bells were cast together at Whitechapel Bell Foundry to a Gillett & Johnston 1922 profile in 2008. The bell frame was constructed and bells hung by Nicholson Engineering of Bridport 2009. The dedication of the eight new bells, clock and chimes was by the Bishop of Truro Timothy Martin Thornton, on his first visit to the Islands. This was on 21 May 2009.

St Mary's Old Church, St Mary's

St Mary's Old Church, St Mary's is a parish church in the Church of England located in Old Town on St Mary's, Isles of Scilly, Cornwall, United Kingdom.
History.
The Anglican church of St Mary was built at Old Town, Isles of Scilly during the 12th century, with re-building carried out in 1666 and 1743. By the nineteenth century, it was derelict and under the orders of Augustus Smith, Lord Proprietor of the Islands, it was restored.
Churchyard.
The churchyard of Old Town church serves as the principal cemetery for the island of St Mary's. Over the centuries countless members of the old Scilly families have been buried here, as have been the crews of numerous ships lost near the Isles. Among them are Sir John Narborough and his brother James, the sons of Rear Admiral Sir John Narborough, who both died in the sinking of "HMS Association" in 1707. Also buried here is Ann Cargill (1760–1784), an 18th-century opera diva and celebrated beauty of her time. She died when her ship sank off the Western Rocks and was first buried on Rosevear, before eventually being interred at Old Town Church.
The churchyard has been enlarged and redesigned several times. Today it is divided into several sections with the oldest surrounding the church itself. This part of the cemetery features a monument to Augustus Smith (1804–1872) as well as mass graves of passengers drowned in the sinking of SS Schiller (1875). During the 19th century, terraces were cut into the hillside to make room for more burials. The grave of Lieutenant Roy Graham (1924–2007), who led the 1967 naval diving expedition that discovered the wreck of Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell's flagship "HMS Association", can be found in one of the newer sections of the cemetery.
Harold Wilson, Lord Wilson of Rievaulx KG OBE FRS PC, who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1964 to 1970 and again from 1974 to 1976, was buried in the churchyard after his death in May 1995.

UltraCommuter

UltraCommuter was a hybrid electric concept car first designed by the University of Queensland Sustainable Energy Group and unveiled in 2005. In 2007 the project was transferred to the Waikato University School of Engineering and further developed in conjunction with HybridAuto Pty.
Design and development.
The UltaCommuter project commenced in 2000 out of the University of Queensland's award winning solar car project, the SunShark. Dr Geoff Walker said the aim was to make a car that people could register and drive from the knowledge gained making the SunShark. The car body toured Queensland in 2005 and 2006 as part of RACQ's roadshow on the history of Queensland motoring called "Bulldust to Bitumen and Beyond". In 2007 Matthew Greaves, Ben Guymer, and Bernie Walsh who started the UltraCommuter project formed HybridAuto and passed development on to Waikato University School of Engineering team lead, Dr. Mike Duke.
The UltraCommuter was described as a long range two seater electric vehicle. It ran on either a single 150 kg lithium battery pack which gave it a range of about 200 km. With two battery packs installed the range is doubled to 400 km. The car could attain speeds of between 120kmh and 170kmh. The cars aluminium honeycomb chassis was about one third the weight of a similar sized production car, and two engines are situated in the rear wheels.
HybridAuto (now Ultramotive Technologies) and Page MacRae, a Mount Maunganui engineering firm, funded the initial development cost of about NZ$150,000, with the intention of making it road legal as a research tool for investigating introducing battery electric cars into New Zealand. Ultramotive provided the electric motors. In 2007 Dr Duke of Waikato University stated that it would take at least 18 months and cost at least $10 million to market and produce between 100 and 2000 electric cars a year.
BEV.
Development work continued at Waikato University with another solar powered car, the single seat battery electric vehicle (BEV), being certified as roadworthy in 2011. This second car was driven from Auckland to Bluff between 24 November and 6 December 2011. They were joined on the journey by Bochum University's solar round the world car.
Refurbished UltraCommuter.
In 2012 Waikato University engineering lecturer, Dr Mike Duke, announced that the University was planning to refurbish the UltraCommuter for entry into the Evolution Class of the 2013 World Solar Challenge.
Production.
Discussions were held in 2008 between the Waikato University electric vehicle project and British car makers with the view to establishing a Britain, Australia and New Zealand consortium that may manufacture electric vehicles in New Zealand but these did not proceed.
World Solar Challenge.
2007.
The UltraCommuter was raced in the Greenfleet Technology Class of the Darwin to Adelaide 2007 World Solar Challenge by a Hybrid Auto and Waikato University Team. The Greenfleet Class of cars in the Challenge aimed to promote more consumer oriented low emission vehicles. 
2013.
Waikato University entered a refurbished version of the UltraCommuter in the 2013 Challenge. A day or so prior to the commencement of the race, during testing, a magnet broke out of the cars right hand motor forcing the team to run the car on one motor. Part way through the first raceday the left hand motor broke with six magnets breaking out making the car unrepairable within the allowed timeframe and prompting its withdrawel. Prior to this the car had performing better than expected and had a longer range than expected.

Barney Fagan

Barney Fagan (January 12, 1850 – January 12, 1937) was a 19th-century American performer, director, choreographer, and composer. He is recognized as being a progenitor of both music and dance genres, and is often referred to as the "Father of Tap Dance." 
Career.
Barney Fagan was born as Bernard J. Fagan in Boston, Massachusetts. He made his first professional appearance in his native city of Boston at the famous Howard Athenaeum in 1860, as the Cabin Boy in "The Pilot of Brest". He remained at this theatre several seasons until 1865 when he played his first minstrel engagement with the Morris Brothers in Boston.
In 1870, Fagan went to Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, and appeared with Pete Lee's Minstrels. In 1873 he joined Buckley's Serenaders in Boston, and took a fellow dancer, Joe Parks, as a partner. During the period 1873-1876, Fagan and Parks, known as the American Lads, played variety engagements. In 1876 he did the famous Heifer dance with Richard Golden in "Evangeline". Mr. Fagan next joined John Fenton in a dancing duet, and continued with him until 1878, when he formed a partnership with Lizzie Mulvey, which lasted one season. Fagan's specialty at that time was "clog dancing"—which was a dance performed while wearing wooden-soled shoes, a very popular form of stage entertainment in the late 19th century.
Beginning in 1879, Mr. Fagan allied himself with Barlow, Wilson, Primrose and West's Minstrels, and continued with them until the company's dissolution in June, 1882. During the three years with Barlow and Wilson, he was general producer and performed as a soloist. Possibly Mr. Fagan's greatest achievement was in organizing and producing Willis Sweatnam, Billy Rice and Fagan's Minstrels, which gave their first performance at Albany, New York, July 25, 1887. This troupe was allegedly the largest minstrel company to travel America's entertainment circuit in the 19th century, featuring 105 performers on parade with 88 in the regular company.
In the following years, Fagan performed with various companies, including Thatcher, Primrose and West; Barlow, Wilson and Rankin's; and Cleveland's Minstrels, where Fagan performed opposite to Luke Schoolcraft.
Outside of minstrelsy, Fagan appeared in whiteface in such plays as "Paradise Alley", and, in 1890, appeared in "High Roller", a production of his own company. At this time, Fagan's work drew praise for notable marches, including "West Point Cadets", the "Phantom Guards" and "The Dance of the Popinjays". During this same period, he was general producer for Corinne for several seasons.
As a song writer he was no less prominent, penning: "Everybody Takes Their Hat Off to Me", and, as mentioned earlier, "My Gal is A High Born Lady". His plays were popular, too: "The Land of Fancy" and "The Game of Love". Starting in 1895, Fagan performed regularly with Herietta Byron, of the Byron Sisters.
In the opinion of Sigmund Spaeth, Fagan's compositions were important in the development of ragtime. In his book "A History of Popular Music in America" (1948), Spaeth said:
He was highly revered by the end of his career. On August 31, 1919, a testimonial dinner was given in his honor in Manhattan, attracting the theatrical luminaries of that era, including Irving Berlin.
Barney Fagan died on his 87th birthday, January 12, 1937, in Bay Shore, Long Island, New York.

Giuseppe Betori

Giuseppe Betori (born 25 February 1947 in Foligno, Italy) is an Italian Cardinal of the Catholic Church. He is the current archbishop of Florence and the former Secretary General of the Italian Episcopal Conference.
Early life.
Ordained priest in 1970. He received a licentiate in theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University and a doctorate in Sacred Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute. He was Professor of anthropology biblical exegesis; Dean of the Theological Institute of Assisi. He also served as undersecretary of Italian Episcopal Conference.
Bishop.
He was nominated by Pope John Paul II as Secretary General of the Italian Episcopal Conference and was simultaneously appointed Titular Bishop of "Falerone". He received episcopal consecration on 6 May 2001. He was confirmed as Secretary General of the Italian Episcopal Conference, for a further five-year term, on 6 April 2006.
Archbishop of Florence.
Betori was appointed to replace Ennio Antonelli, who had been appointed as president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, as archbishop of Florence by Pope Benedict XVI on 8 September 2008. He received the pallium from Pope Benedict on 29 June 2009, the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul in Rome. [http://212.77.1.245/news_services/press/vis/dinamiche/b0_en.htm]
On 5 November 2011 Archbishop Betori survived an apparent assassination attempt. An unidentified man confronted the archbishop outside his office, shot and wounded the prelate's secretary, and waved a gun at the archbishop before escaping. Fr Paolo Brogi, the archbishop's secretary, was reportedly in satisfactory condition after surgery to repair an abdominal wound. Archbishop Betori and witnesses stated that the gunman said something as he gestured toward the prelate with his firearm, but they could not understand his intent.
On 10 December 2011 he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture for a five-year renewable term.
On 6 January 2012 it was announced that Betori would become a cardinal on 18 February. He was created Cardinal-Priest of "San Marcello" and will having voting rights in a possible conclave until his 80th birthday. In addition to his duties at Culture, Cardinal Betori was appointed a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education.
Views.
Life and family issues.
In a 2007 speech, he identified as the new enemies of Christianity: abortion, euthanasia, the negation of sexual duality and of a family based on marriage.
Ordination of homosexuals.
Betori has favoured a ban on the ordination of homosexuals, saying the word discrimination can be used where there is a right, but that a vocation is not a right but a gift.
Relationship with Benedict XVI.
According to Abbé Claude Barthe, Betori is a member of the paleoliberal wing of the Roman Curia, who along with Giovanni Battista Re, has constituted a kind of internal curial opposition to the decisions and policies of Pope Benedict XVI.

Martin Cassini

Martin Cassini is a TV programme-maker and campaigner for traffic system reform. He advocates replacing priority (an engineering model) with equality (a social model) to provide a level playing-field on which all road-users can act sociably. This, he says, would remove the "need" for most traffic controls, and solve many of our road safety and congestion problems, which stem from those very controls.
He has contributed to "Economic Affairs" (journal of the Institute of Economic Affairs), "The Times", "Guardian", "Daily Telegraph", BBC Newsnight and Traffic Technology International.
His reforms overlap with the shared space movement of Hans Monderman and Ben Hamilton-Baillie, which is demonstrating in Bohmte and Drachten that peaceful coexistence can flourish when road-users are free to use their own judgement on roads designed to stimulate rather than enforce appropriate conduct. His ideas also echo the theory of spontaneous order, which states that the more complex the dance of human movement (e.g. a skateboard park), the less useful are attempts to control it.
He helped instigate a lights-off trial in Portishead, Somerset, which began on 14 September 2009. Conducted in association with North Somerset Council and Colin Buchanan, it went permanent after journey times fell by over 50% with no loss of pedestrian safety, despite greater numbers now using the route (over 2000 vehicles and 300 pedestrians an hour).
The idea is spreading, e.g. to Westminster, Oxford and Bristol, where minor trials have taken place. But deregulation is not enough on its own, says Cassini. It needs to be accompanied by changes in road design, culture and the law.
He is a graduate from Wadham College, Oxford, (1971), and a member of the International Advisory Council of the Kyoto World Cities New Mobility Program.

List of gunboat and gunvessel classes of the Royal Navy

This is a list of gunboat and gunvessel classes of the Royal Navy.
Steam gunboats.
Composite screw gunboats.
The gunboats designed from 1870 onwards were of composite construction, i.e. they had an iron keel, stem and stern posts, and iron framing, with wooden planking retained over the iron frames.
Armoured gunboats.
The only ironclads of gunboat size were three largely experimental (and unsuccessful) vessels ordered in 1864. The first two were towed to Bermuda (being considered unsatisfactory to sail under their own power) where they served as harbour vessels. "Vixen" was the first twin-screw vessel built for the Royal Navy, and "Waterwitch" employed a form of water pump propulsion.
Steam gunvessels.
Iron paddle gunvessels.
NB. A third vessel of the class was retained by Prussia.
Wooden screw gunvessels.
This section includes two early iron-hulled screw gunvessels ordered in May 1845, which in other respects were half-sisters to two wooden-hulled gunvessels ordered at the same time. The four vessels comprised the first-class gunvessels "Rifleman" (wooden hulled) and "Sharpshooter" (iron hulled), and the second-class gunvessels "Teazer" (wooden hulled) and "Minx" (iron hulled). Further vessels ordered later to the same design were either cancelled or built to very different concepts. "Rifleman" and "Sharpshooter" were re-classed as sloops in 1854.
Composite screw gunvessels.
The gunvessels designed from 1867 onwards were of composite construction, i.e. they had an iron keel, stem and stern posts, and iron framing, with wooden planking retained over the iron frames.

François Duval (dancer)

François Duval (born 21 May 1743, Paris), known as Malter, was a French dancer.
The son of Antoine Duval, a dance master in Paris, and of Henriette Brigitte Malter, two of his elder brothers were also involved in the theatre world - Antoine Jean François Duval (1732-?) left Paris in 1755 and worked as a dance master in Rochefort/Mer, whilst Jean Charles Duval (1741-?) was first violin at the Comédie de Lyon. François Duval was thus part of the Malter family, an 18th century dynasty of dancers and dance-teachers, and married Marie-Anne Hamoir, also from a family of dancers.
François became ballet master at the Académie royale de Danse. From 1778 he worked with Louis Hamoir and Jean Nicolas Le Mercier, then François Bigottini, as head of the Théâtre des Variétés-Amusantes, on rue de Bondy à Paris, at the théâtre de la foire Saint-Laurent.

It was created in 1992, following an initiative from Eastern Arts and a number of key figures including Nicholas Cleobury, who recognised the need for an orchestra in the East of England. It is a flexible ensemble composed of chamber musicians in Europe. The players are freelance musicians who are employed on a project-by-project basis and the ensemble performs around 70 concerts per year and works with hundreds of people in the communities where the orchestra is resident.
It is a not-for-profit organisation, and a registered charity.
Mission statement.
"To inspire people with fresh and exciting performances of great music both through the work we present and the way in which we present it, with an approach recognized for its integrity, intelligence and, above all, excellence." 
The orchestra is acclaimed for its virtuoso musicianship, an inspired approach to concert programming which makes bold, intelligent connections across 400 years of repertoire, and a versatility that is second to none. Britten Sinfonia breaks the mould by not having a principal conductor or director, instead choosing to collaborate with a range of the finest international guest artists from across the musical spectrum, resulting in performances of rare insight and energy.
Recent seasons have included projects with Brad Mehldau, Thomas Adès, Pierre-Laurent Aimard, James MacMillan, Ian Bostridge, Joanna MacGregor, Masaaki Suzuki, Polyphony, director Katie Mitchell, Imogen Cooper, Dhafer Youssef, These New Puritans, Jaga Jazzist and Rufus Wainwright. In 2013-14 Britten Sinfonia collaborates with artists including Paul Lewis, Ian Bostridge, Netia Jones, Mark Padmore, Pekka Kuusisto, Iestyn Davies, Patricia Kopatchinskaja and the Richard Alston Dance Company with premières from composers including Sally Beamish, Roderick Williams, Mark Simpson, Brett Dean and Philip Cashian. 
Britten Sinfonia performs in concert halls around Europe and Festivals and is a regular at the BBC Proms and has residencies in Cambridge, Norwich, and Brighton with a concert series at London’s Barbican Centre and Wigmore Hall. The ensemble enjoys an international profile, a recent highlight being a tour of South America, and is frequently heard on disc, BBC Radio 3 and commercial radio. The orchestra has received awards including a Gramophone Award and in 2007 won the prestigious Royal Philharmonic Society Ensemble Award in recognition for its work.
Creative learning.
The Creative Learning department of the Sinfonia provides educational support to the mainstream concert season. These activities involve:
- Pre-concert talks
- The "SinfoniaCast", a podcast featuring interviews with guest artists and composers
- Projects specifically for young people and schools
- Family Music Days, and
- Music-based training for businesses and corporations.
All of these activities are led by Britten Sinfonia’s musicians and associated composers and workshop leaders. For audiences of all ages and levels of experience, the Creative Learning programme offers opportunities to meet, talk to and work with performers and composers; discover more about the ensemble's wide-ranging repertoire; and develop new musical knowledge and skills.

Francesco Bigottini

Francesco or François Bigottini (c.1717, Rome - after 1794, probably in Paris) was an Italian actor, playwright, set designer and grip active in Italy, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland and Spain.
Life.
In his "Mémoires", Carlo Goldoni says he first met Bigottini in Rimini in 1741, where the latter was playing harlequin rôles. From the 1750s Bigottini appeared in the Netherlands, Austrian Netherlands and France, playing in Rotterdam in 1754, Brussels in 1756, and in Paris at the Théâtre-Italien in 1757. Gueullette wrote "On Wednesday 26 April , an Italian harlequin called Bigottini made his début in "Arlequin Scanderberg" and "Arlequin Hulla"; in the former, he played a rôle as a master of music very well, and played very badly in "Arlequin Hulla"; he was sent packing shortly afterwards". Bigottini left for the French provinces and acted in Marseille in 1760, where he put on his own play "Coraline Protée" (1761). He was in Geneva from 1766 to 1768, where he printed his play "L'Origine d'Arlequin, avec sa naissance" (1766). The "Mercure de France" wrote that he was the "first inventor of the machines used in the metamorphosis in the "Fée Urgelle" in Geneva" (that is, the transformation of a cottage into a splendid castle).
After playing in Lyon, Bigottini travelled towards Spain and spent three years playing at the Italian opera-house in Cádiz, from which he negotiated to be taken on at Brussels Théâtre de la Monnaie. In one of his letters, he wrote to that theatre's heads, Vitzthumb and Compain "I have nearly all my sets and machines for my plays, and I would thus also furnish you with all that I have, sets, machines, ropes, pulleys, scrap and all the other "diableries", if you would be furnish me with the wood". They finally took him on as a harlequin for the 1774-1775 season, with his contract stipulating that he would "lend theatre all his machines and sets".
On 18 February 1777, he made a second début at the Théâtre-Italien, in "Arlequin esprit follet", a play he had written himself. The "Mercure de France" wrote: "His metamorphoses are very numerous and very surprising. Mr Bigottini is admired for the variety of his changes, by their speed and attack with which he executes them, by the contrast he makes between his different rôles, and by the varied talents he develops. This actor sings, in a strong and pleasing manner, airs of his own composition.". However, after the suppression of the Italian theatrical genre in Paris at the start of 1780, Bigottini was dismissed with a compensation corresponding to his previous salary.
In January 1780, he collaborated with François Duval-Malter, Louis Hamoir and Jean-Nicolas Le Mercier to head the Théâtre des Variétés-Amusantes, but had to give up this post 11 months later due to his own financial difficulties. He left for the provinces and set himself up in Toulouse, where he devoted himself to painting and had a child, the future dancer Émilie Bigottini.

Victorian Railways E class (electric)

The Victorian Railways E class was a class of electric locomotive that ran on the Victorian Railways from 1923 until 1984. Introduced shortly after the electrification of the suburban rail system in Melbourne, Australia, and based on the same electrical and traction equipment as Melbourne's early suburban electric multiple unit fleet, they provided power for suburban goods services and shunting for six decades.
History.
With the rapid expansion of Melbourne's suburban electrification scheme, becoming by 1924 the largest in the world at 346 miles (557 km), the Victorian Railways decided to utilise the advantages of electric traction for suburban goods services, which until then had been hauled by steam locomotives such as the Y class 0-6-0, E class 2-4-2T and later Dde class 4-6-2T. 
In 1923 it introduced two electric locomotives of 620 hp (460 kW), built at VR's Newport and Jolimont Workshops with the same General Electric traction motors and related electrical equipment that had been installed in Melbourne's Tait and Swing Door electric suburban train sets.
Production.
The first two locomotives were built with a steeplecab-style appearance. Despite their appearance and unlike other steeplecab locomotives, they also included a large amount of the electrical equipment including the dynamotor in the driver's cab. The exposure of the driver to this electrical equipment led to them being nicknamed "electric chairs" among drivers. 
A further ten locomotives were built in 1928-29 with similar electrical equipment, but on a longer frame with enclosed cabs at each end. 
Until the later introduction of the L class Co-Co electric locomotives in 1953, these locomotives were simply known as "Electric Locomotives Nos 1100 to 1111", there being no others in the VR fleet. With the E class steam locomotives withdrawn by the 1950s, the ten box-cab locomotives 1102 to 1111 took the E class designation to differentiate them from the L class fleet. Steeple cabs 1100 and 1101 only ever wore a number, not a letter classification.
Regular service.
Upon introduction, the two steeple-cab locomotives proved the superiority of electric traction. They were able to operate together with multiple-unit train control, allowing a single crew to control both as an articulated locomotive with greater tractive effort than the Victorian Railways C class heavy goods locomotive, the most powerful locomotive on the VR at the time. Based on their success, suburban goods sidings were rapidly electrified and most suburban goods traffic utilised electric traction. With the electrification of the Gippsland line as far as Traralgon in the 1950s, the range of the E class locomotives was similarly extended and they could be found shunting or hauling services along the line.
Locomotives 1100 to 1111 were originally painted in a plain black livery, matching that of the VR steam locomotive fleet. During the 1960s the ten box-cabs were painted in a variation of the blue and gold livery applied to the VR diesel fleet. The locomotives were initially based at the Jolimont Workshops along with the suburban electric multiple unit fleet, as steam locomotives were housed at the North Melbourne Locomotive Depot. However with the opening of the new South Dynon Locomotive Depot in 1964, the entire E class fleet was relocated there in June 1968.
Demise.
The first two steeple-cab locomotives were scrapped in July 1955, deemed uneconomic to upgrade with new electrical and coupling equipment. By this time, the electric locomotive fleet had been substantially expanded with L class locomotives of a far more modern design. 
The box-cab E class locomotives continued in service. However, during the 1970s, Victorian Railways conducted detailed studies of goods traffic and found that handling costs made the transport of high rated, small freight items unprofitable. As a result of these studies, rail freight operations were rationalised around block trains carrying bulk freight such as gravel, rice or grain, and suburban goods sidings were closed in favour of road freight service. Furthermore, the use of block trains greatly reduced the need for shunting locomotives. These operational changes rendered the ageing E class suburban electric locomotives surplus, and by 1981 scrappings had commenced. The last was withdrawn from service in 1984.
Preservation.
Four E class locomotives have survived into preservation. As of May 2007, their disposition is as follows:

George Watson RSA (1767 – 24 August 1837) was a Scottish portrait painter and first president of the Royal Scottish Academy.
Life and work.
Watson was born at his father's estate, Overmains, Berwickshire, in 1767, the son of John Watson and Frances Veitch of Elliott. He received his early education in Edinburgh, and got some instruction in painting from Alexander Nasmyth but when 18 years of age he went to London with an introduction to Sir Joshua Reynolds, who received him as a pupil. After two years spent in Sir Joshua's studio, he returned to Edinburgh, and established himself as a portrait-painter.
In 1808 he was associated with other painters in starting a society of artists, which, however, only lasted a few years. He exhibited frequently at the Royal Academy and the British Institution, and about 1815 was invited to London to paint a number of portraits, including those of the dean of Canterbury and Benjamin West. In 1820, in spite of much opposition from the Royal Institution, the Scottish Academy was founded, and Watson, who had been president of the previous society, was elected to the same office in the new one, the ultimate success of which was largely due to his tact and ability. He continued as president until his death, the academy receiving its royal charter a few months afterwards.
It is said that he long maintained an honourable rivalry with Henry Raeburn but, although his grasp of character was firm, his executive power considerable, and his work belonged to a fine convention, his portraiture lacks the qualities which give that of his fellow artist enduring interest. He is represented in the National Gallery of Scotland by portraits of two brother artists, Benjamin West and Alexander Skirving; and in the Scottish Portrait Gallery by a number of portraits, including one of himself, and one of William Smellie, which some consider his best piece of work.
Shortly after his return from his first visit to London he married Rebecca, daughter of William Smellie, printer and naturalist, who, with five children, survived him.
Watson died in Edinburgh on 24 August 1837.
Family.
His son, William Smellie Watson (1796–1874), was born in Edinburgh, and, like his father and his cousin, Sir John Watson Gordon became a portrait-painter. He was a pupil of his father's, studied at the Trustees' Academy, and from 1815, for five years, in the schools of the London Royal Academy, and worked for a year with Sir David Wilkie while that artist was painting "The Penny Wedding" and other pictures. Returning to Edinburgh, he made a good connection as a portrait-painter, became one of the founders of the Scottish Academy, and for nearly fifty years exhibited with unfailing regularity. He solely confined himself to portraiture.
He died in Edinburgh on 6 November 1874. He was a devoted student of natural history, particularly ornithology, and formed an extensive collection of specimens, which he bequeathed to Edinburgh University.

Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAFE

Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAFE, also known as GOTAFE, is a Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute located in the north east region of Victoria, Australia based on the Goulburn and Ovens rivers, and is the largest regional TAFE in Victoria, and a specialist centre for food processing, equine and dairy education. 
A wide selection of study options are offered from short courses, apprenticeships, traineeships, certificates, diplomas and advanced diplomas under the Australian Qualifications Framework.
National Centre for Dairy Education Australia.
In 2005, Dairy Australia and the Institute formed a partnership to create the National Centre for Dairy Education Australia (NCDEA) to enable a single national framework for dairy education and training. 
With University of Melbourne announcing the divestment of agricultural vocational education and training in its rural facilities in September 2005, the "Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAFE" through the "National Centre for Dairy Education Australia" was able to purchase the campus and facilities at Dookie, Warragul and Werribee. The Institute saw the Werribee campus as particularly important for continuing the linkage between dairy education, dairy research and specialised dairy equipment and expertise located within Dairy Innovation Australia Limited and Food Science Australia.
The "National Centre for Dairy Education Australia" is based on campuses at Shepparton, Terang, Warragul, and Werribee.
National Centre for Equine Education.
The Institute established in 2006 the National Centre for Equine Education to deliver Vocational Education and Training (VET) for the equine industry based at its Tone Rd Campus in Wangaratta focusing on courses in equine breeding, racing and health. 
The "National Centre for Equine Education" has two campuses: Tone Rd, Wangaratta and Warragul]].
Innoven.
The Innoven division of GOTAFE focuses on innovative education programs in Hospitality, Baking, Food processing, Leadership, Logistics, Lean manufacturing, Meat Processing and OHS.
Innoven campuses are at Werribee and Shepparton.
Campuses.
The Institute has four main campuses based in Benalla, Seymour, Shepparton and Wangaratta. Other campuses are located at Terang, Warragul and Werribee.
Benalla.
The Benalla campus is the newest of the Institute's main campuses. In 2004 Lynne Kosky, the Minister for Education, opened the "Benalla Performing Arts and Convention Centre" at the Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAFE. Kosky said "This campus facilitates the delivery of approximately 226,000 student contact hours to more than 1100 students each year," The $4.2 million campus was funded jointly by the State Government, Benalla Rural City Council and the Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAFE.
Benalla is also the home of GRADA, a regional academy of dramatic art offering courses in Acting, Dance and Production. GRADA: GOTAFE Regional Academy of Dramatic Arts
Shepparton.
There are two campuses in Shepparton. The Fryers Street Campus houses the Institute's Administration and a large number of teaching Departments. On the outskirts of Shepparton is the William Orr campus: a 120 hectare property which is the site of the Shepparton Horticulture, Agriculture and Dairy Farming (NCDEA), Agricultural Automotive, Plumbing, and Building and Construction departments.
Seymour.
The Seymour campus was opened in 1998 and offers a variety of courses. 
Wangaratta.
The Docker street campus in Wangaratta offers a broad range of courses from business studies to music with a central area containing a cafeteria, library and student services. The Tone Rd campus on the outskirts of Wangaratta is the home for the National Centre for Equine Education, Animal Sciences, Agriculture and the Horticulture & Viticulture Department.
History.
In October 1996 the "Goulburn Valley Institute of TAFE" and the "Wangaratta Institute of TAFE" were combined to form the "Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAFE".
The origins of the Institute are based on the "Wangaratta Technical School", which existed from 1928 to 1972 and the "Shepparton Technical College" which existed from 1953 to 1981. These educational institutions offered a trades and technical focussed secondary education. In 1972 the "Wangaratta Technical School" became the "Wangaratta Technical College", followed by "Wangarrata College of TAFE" in 1981, and "Wangarrata Institute of TAFE" in 1995. 
The "Shepparton Technical College" became the "Shepparton College of TAFE" in 1981, then the "Goulburn Valley College of TAFE" in 1986, "Goulburn Valley Community College" in 1992, and "Goulburn Valley Institute of TAFE" in 1995.

Sectional Appendix

In Great Britain, the Sectional Appendix is a railway document compiled by Network Rail and is the official definition of railway infrastructure, giving a detailed description of all railway lines owned by Network Rail. It has traditionally been published in printed format, originally as a bound book and subsequently in loose-leaf format, for ease of updating.
History.
In earlier years, instructions to traincrews relating to the operation of the railway were included within the working timetables. As the volume of instructions increased, they later came to be published in a separate document, known in full as the ""Sectional Appendix to the Working Timetable"" or similar.
Content.
There are modules for different areas, e.g. KSW2 covers Kent and Sussex. Each module may be divided in a similar way to the following sections:
Section 1: Route Module.
Outline maps providing a general overview of the route showing lines, station names, and reference numbers. The numbers relate to pages in the detailed Table A diagrams.
This is a list of known areas for exceptionally poor railhead conditions. It states the route, location, lines affected, and the mileage references between which it occurs. 
This section comprises the main bulk of the module, and contains detailed maps. Information available includes;
All distances are given in miles and chains.
Special arrangement is a condition where a speciific location requires there to be an operational variance to the Rulebook, or an addition to it. This section details a route, locations where the arrangement begins and ends, the type of train this applies to, the line affected, and details of the operation.
Section 2: Route Availability.
This is a list of which train types are permitted to travel over each route referenced to Table A. It specifies every class of train allowed, sectionalised by type;
Section 3: General Instructions.
Provides general information pertaining to operations over the whole area/route.
Section 4: Local Instructions.
Provides detailed information relating to specific practices at given locations.
National Electronic Sectional Appendix.
The "National Electronic Sectional Appendix" (NESA) is an online alternative to hard copy Sectional Appendices, although the latter are still being published and can be bought on-line, direct from Willsons Printers of Newark. Willsons also supply the various parts of the Rule Book in printed form and other items such as the AC Electrified Lines Instructions.
Periodically updated electronic versions of the Sectional Appendix are available in PDF format from the Network Rail website.

Oddmund Vik

Oddmund Jakobsen Vik (19 April 1858 – 12 February 1930) was a Norwegian politician for the Liberal Party.
He was born in Vik i Øystese as the son of farmer Jakob Larsen Vik (1828-1925) and his wife Magnhild Nilsdotter Laupsa (1828-1914). He graduated from the teacher's college at Stord in 1877, and worked as a teacher in Sund in 1878, at Sagatun folk high school the next year, in Telemark from 1879, in Askov from 1882 and Andebu from 1884 to 1888. In 1885 he wrote a piece in "Dagbladet", "Fra Ekserserpladsen Tvildemoen", which was seen as anti-military agitation. He was sentenced to 40 days in prison by a military court; the sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court. He was also ordered to pay NOK 100 in costs. However, the government of Norway changed the sentencing to ten days in prison and no costs.
In 1888 he was hired as chief editor of "Rogalands Folkeblad". The next year the name was changed to "Stavanger Avis", and Vik was hired as subeditor under new editor Alexander Kielland. He then worked as chief editor again from 1890 to 1908. He was the chairman of the board of "Venstres Presseforening" from 1899 to 1900. He was active in local politics, serving as deputy mayor of Stavanger from 1898 to 1901 and 1904 to 1912, and mayor from 1913 to 1914. In 1900 he was elected to the Norwegian Parliament, representing the constituency "Stavanger og Haugesund". He sat through one term, but was later re-elected in 1910.
In 1914 Vik was appointed County Governor of "Romsdals Amt". The county was shortly thereafter renamed Møre, and is now known as Møre og Romsdal. During the First World War he briefly left this office, to lead the newly created Ministry of Provisioning in the second cabinet Knudsen from July 1916 to November 1917. When he left this position, he returned as County Governor of Møre, leaving in 1928 to become a pensioner.

The Carpenter's Pencil

"The Carpenter's Pencil (O lapis do carpinteiro" in Galician) is a book written by the Galician author Manuel Rivas. The story revolves around a young couple, Daniel Da Barca and Marisa Mallo. Their happiness is destroyed when Galicia falls under a Falanxist dictatorship.
The plot.
Dr Daniel Da Barca is a left-wing political activist who believes that women should have the right to vote in Galicia. He attends many rallies and gives speeches, always accompanied by his devoted girlfriend Marisa Mallo. Unbeknown to Da Barca, he has been watched by Herbal, an agent for the Civil Guard. When the Falanxists take control of the country, Da Barca is arrested for his left wing ideals in Santiago de Compostela.
Meanwhile Marisa's father Don Benito is trying to marry her off to Alejandro, a lieutenant in the Falanxist army. Marisa confides in her cousin, Laura that she cannot forget about Da Barca and is determined to get the condemned doctor out of prison. Beforehand Marisa had visited Daniel in the prison and he ordered her to forget about him and move on with her life.
The prison is run by the cruel and sadistic Zalo Puga, a high ranking Falanxist. Zalo is married to Herbal's sister, Beatriz. Zalo holds an intense and burning hatred for all left wingers, and especially Da Barca.
When the prisoner, Gonzalo Rincon is tortured and murdered by Zalo and two other Falanxists he drops his pencil, which is picked up by Herbal. The Civil Guard keeps the pencil for his own.
Meanwhile Da Barca has been allowed to help out in the prison ward, due to his medical practices. He works alongside a nun Mother Izarne, with whom Da Barca develops a genuine friendship and Dr Solans. Solans has been stealing morphine from the ward to feed his own addiction to the drug.
It soon becomes clear to Da Barca, that most of the prisoners could be cured of their illness by a healthy diet such as fruit. When he tries to acquire this, he is beaten by Herbal and the other guards.
Marisa is desperate to secure Da Barca's release, and pleads with her father to write to his influential friends to negotiate the doctor's release. Don Benito refuses, and Marisa attempts suicide. She fails in her attempt and it is this act, that finally convinces Don Benito to write letters. He hands them to Marisa, and tells her to deliver them to his friends like the Archbishop of Santiago and The Mayor of Vigo. Marisa delivers them happily, unbeknown that her father has actually betrayed her. In the letter, Benito has written that Da Barca must be executed for the good of the Falanxist cause.
The movie continues with Da Barca trying to survive the harsh and brutal conditions in the prison, whilst at the same time trying to help his fellow inmates through illness and despair.
Other.
The book was adapted into a feature length film starring Luis Tosar and Tristan Ulloa.

<doc id="19229516" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19229516" title="Montello (hill)">
Montello (hill)

The Montello is a hill in the province of Treviso, Veneto, northern Italy, and the site of a World War I battle. 
The bean-shaped hill measures about 5 km north-south by 13 km east-west. It rises to a maximum of 371 m elevation from the alluvial plain of the Piave River, which runs along the north and west edges of the hill, at about 140 m elevation.
The Montello is crossed in the east-west direction by a local road that begins as Via 18 Giugno in the town of Pederiva di Biadene, continues as Strada La Dorsale and Via Frati, and ends as Via Ossario in the town of Nervesa della Battaglia. Several local roads in the general north-south direction connect this "dorsal spine" of the Montello to the two main alternative routes around the hill, either along on its southern margin (comprised by Stradone del Bosco, Via Fra Giocondo, Via Pedemontana, Via Francesco Baracca, Via Arditi, Via Armando Diaz) or along the northern margin (the Panoramic Road, comprised by Via Gabriele d'Annunzio, Via Nord Montello, Via Riviera Piave, Via Decima Armata).
The hill gave its name to several towns nested against its base Crocetta del Montello, Montebelluna, Volpago del Montello, Giavera del Montello, and Nervesa della Battaglia.
The hill is presently covered with a mix of wooded areas, residential homes, and small farms. The church and monument of Santa Maria della Vittoria, built after the battle of 1918, is located on top of the montello, about 3.5 km north of Volpago (to which it belongs) and 5 km east from Pederiva.
History.
The Montello has been inhabited since pre-historical times; chipped stone points from the Mesolithic have been found along the northern edge. The early inhabitants probably occupied the many natural caves that bore into the hill.
In Classical Antiquity the region surrounding the Montello was settled by reformed soldiers of the Roman army.
During the Middle Ages, the "Certosa" (Carthusian monastery) of San Gerolamo and the abbey of Sant'Eustachio were built. It was in the latter that, between 1550 and 1555, Giovanni Della Casa wrote "Il Galateo'.
The oaks and chestnut trees that covered the Montello since antiquity used to be a major source of timber for the region, especially for the shipyards and building foundations of Venice. Due to its strategic importance, the Republic of Venice assumed the ownership of the hill, and declared it off-limits to the local population. Deprived of their homes and their main source of income, the hunters and woodsmen of the Montello became a class of landless, homeless and jobless miserables, the "bisnenti" (the 'twice have-nots'), who survived on odd jobs and occasionally crimes. Eventually, many locals took to the roads of emigration, in the Americas, France, Germany and Australia.
In 1892, moved by the plight of the "bisnenti", Senator Pietro Bertolini pushed through legislation which parcelled the Montello land among them. The initiative was not very successful, since the poor soil was not very suitable for agriculture. In any case, the re-settlement and the ravages of World War I led to the demise of the native woods, and their partial replacement by robinias, a bush native to the Americas that was brought to the region in the late 18th century.
On July 24th, 1930, the Montello area was affected by an extremely violent tornado, probably the strongest in Europe in historical times, with gusts estimated at 500 km/h and an estimated ranking of F5 on the Fujita scale. It was strong enough to level masonry buildings, and it caused the death of at least 23 people.

Tobacco Road (play)

Tobacco Road is a play by Jack Kirkland first performed in 1933, based on the novel of the same name by Erskine Caldwell. The play ran on Broadway for a total of 3,182 performances, becoming the longest-running play in history at the time. As of 2013, it is still the 18th longest-running Broadway show in history, as well as being the second longest-running non-musical ever on Broadway.
Productions.
"Tobacco Road" opened on Broadway at the Theatre Masque (now the John Golden Theatre) on December 4, 1933, transferred to the 48th Street Theatre (demolished in 1955), where it ran from July 16, 1934 through September 1934, and then moved to the Forrest Theatre (now the Eugene O'Neill Theatre) where it ran until May 31, 1941, for a total of 3,182 performances.
It was revived three times on Broadway:
It was banned in the UK for many years, finally being licensed for public performance in 1949.
The La Jolla Playhouse (California) production ran from September 30 through October 26, 2008.
The American Blues Theater (Chicago) production ran from May 21 through June 20, 2010.
Plot synopsis.
In desolate farm country in Georgia the profitable tobacco crop has given way to cotton plantations, but poor planting practices have depleted the soil. The Lester family were once sharecroppers but are now poverty-stricken and unable to cope with the bleak life they face. Jeeter Lester, the patriarch, lives in squalor with his wife Ada, their two children, 16-year-old Dude and 18-year-old Ellie May, and his mother. Ada is suffering from pellagra and Ellie May has a harelip, Jeeter and Dude are thin and emaciated, and the family wears tattered clothing.
Sister Bessie Rice, a stout preacher of about forty, decides to marry Dude, who agrees when she promises to buy him a car. When Capt. Tim Harmon tells the family that the house and property are owned by the bank, Jeeter is given a chance to earn money so that they may keep living there, but he refuses.
The youngest daughter Pearl tries to escape from her much older husband Lov Bensey, but Ada is run over by Dude's car as she attempts to help Pearl. As Ada lies dying Pearl escapes and runs away; Jeeter sends Ellie May to Lov instead.
Response.
The play received unfavorable reviews, but gained audiences after ticket prices were cut (from $3.30 to $1.10, 1930s dollars). The show also toured, becoming "phenomenal" on the road, playing repeat engagements.
Brooks Atkinson wrote: "The theatre has never sheltered a fouler or more degenerate parcel of folks than the hardscrabble family of Lester...It is the blunt truth of the characters he is describing, and it leaves a malevolent glow of poetry... As Jeeter Lester, Henry Hull gives the performance of his career. Plays as clumsy and rudderless as 'Tobacco Road' seldom include so many scattered items that leave such a vivid impression."
The play was banned in major cities such as Chicago and Detroit for being sensational and immoral.

Ruth Ashton Taylor (born 1921) is a retired American television and radio newscaster, with a career in broadcasting that spanned over 50 years. She was the first female newscaster on television in Los Angeles and the West Coast. She has received many awards and honors, including a Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Biography.
A native of Los Angeles, Ruth Ashton graduated in 1939 from Long Beach Polytechnic High School. She relocated to New York City thereafter, receiving a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in 1944.
Following her graduation, she took a job as a news writer at CBS radio, taking a place among the original members of the documentary unit of Edward R. Murrow. When she first began as a writer and producer there, she had no thoughts of going on air as, to her knowledge, it simply wasn't done in major news markets. According to Ashton, CBS management didn't want to broadcast women because they "just didn't like those squeaky voices". However, by 1949, she was on the air, interviewing such notable individuals as Albert Einstein. Eventually, she was transferred to a religious program, and, disappointed by her exclusion from news broadcasting, she left CBS radio in New York and returned to Los Angeles.
In 1951, she became the first woman in Los Angeles or on the West Coast on television news when she took a job with LA's KNXT-TV (now KCBS). Although originally hired to cover the "Women's Angle", she has indicated in interviews that the lack of conventional roles for women in broadcasting gave her considerable freedom in the stories she selected to cover. In 1958, she left briefly to work as a public information officer at a college before returning in 1962. She officially retired in 1989, but continued occasionally contributing into her 70s. As a news reporter and program host, she became an influential figure on subsequent female journalists, with numerous industry awards and a career that included notable interviews with such diverse people as Jimmy Carter and Jimmy Durante.
During her time in broadcasting, Ashton Taylor became a widely known and celebrated figure. In 1983, "The Los Angeles Times" indicated that she had a reputation as "one of the best newspeople in television". A 2007 article in the "Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media" described her as "one of the most recognizable people on radio and television in Los Angeles"
She received a Star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1990. Other notable honors include a Governors Award for Lifetime Achievement bestowed by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and a Diamond Achievement Award from Women in Communications (1984).
The Good News Foundation, an organization of women journalists in Los Angeles, offers in her name to female students intending a career in journalism a scholarship which not only provides financial assistance but also the mentorship of a working professional.

Théâtre Royal du Parc

The Théâtre Royal du Parc (French), Parktheater (Dutch) is a theatre at 3, Rue de la Loi in Brussels, on the edge of the Brussels Park facing the Federal Parliament. Its nearest Metro stations are the Arts-Loi/Kunst-Wet metro station and the Park metro station.
History.
Built in 1782 to plans by the architect Louis Montoyer, the Théâtre du Parc was at first an annexe to the Théâtre de la Monnaie : the brothers Alexandre and Herman Bultos exploited the two theatres at the same time, with the "Parc" used for plays featuring young actors, as a sort of drama school for La Monnaie. It was closed in 1807 by Napoleon's decree on the theatres, but re-opened in 1814 and was occupied by a British company for a year then a Dutch company for a few months.
From 1819, the City of Brussels, owner of these two "Royal Theatres", granted a concession to one director after another. The company and repertoire were identical yet distinct, with the Théâtre du Parc specialising in vaudeville and théâtre de boulevard.
From 1850 to 1854, the "Parc" hosted Dutch productions, then specialised in operetta and opéra-comique, and finally (from 1869) in comedies. During the First World War both theatres were requisitioned and the Parc became a playhouse for the German garrison. Returning to Francophone theatre in 1919, it put on classic pieces featuring Belgian actors. Its present director is Yves Larec.

Elizabeth Cromwell

Elizabeth Cromwell ["née" Bourchier] (1598–1665) was the wife of Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland. She is sometimes referred to as the "Lady Protectress" or "Protectress Joan".
Family and marriage.
The Protectress was the daughter of Sir James Bourchier, Knt. of Felsted in Essex, who was a wealthy London leather merchant and his wife Frances Crane, daughter of Thomas Crane of Newton Tony, Wiltshire. She was born on an unknown date in 1598. Elizabeth was the eldest of twelve children.
Harris speaks of the Bourchiers as "an ancient family;" but Noble, who was better informed, is of a different opinion. It was only in 1610, he tells us, that Sir James obtained a grant of arms (Sable, three ounces in passant in pale or spotted) and he adds that the only occasion when the arms of the Bourchiers were quartered with those of the Protector was at his funeral, when they appeared on the escutcheons.
On 22 August 1620 at St.Giles, Cripplegate, London she married Oliver Cromwell. The marriage produced nine children, eight of whom reached adulthood. The marriage to Elizabeth was very advantageous for Cromwell, as her father brought him into contact with the wealthy merchant community of London, and due to the extensive lands Sir James owned in Essex, this family association would later guarantee him much support from the influential families of the local puritan gentry. At the time of his marriage, however, Cromwell had not yet become an ardent puritan. Their marriage was happy, and they were devoted to one another. This can be attested by the solicitous love letters Cromwell wrote to Elizabeth while away on his military campaigns. Some of these were published in an anthology of love letters written by Antonia Fraser in 1976.
The abuse that was heaped on her husband has naturally been shared by Elizabeth. The Cavaliers styled her contemptuously Joan, and accused her of every manner of vice, among which drunkenness and adultery were the most prominent. As the charges, however, appear to have been without foundation, the libels fell probably harmless.
She is known to have been introduced to Charles I, at the time that the unfortunate monarch was a prisoner at Hampton Court, and on good terms with her husband: Ashburnham took her by the hand and presented her to the King, by whom, together with the ladies of Ireton and Whalley, she was afterwards entertained.
Protectress Joan.
A miniature of Elizabeth Cromwell was painted by miniature painter Samuel Cooper who describes her as "neither uncomely or undignified in person.". However John Heneage Jesse writing in 1846 concludes that "in person, the Protectress was exceedingly plain", in allusion to which Abraham Cowley, in his play "Cutter of Colman Street", puts the following passage into the mouth of Cutter :—" He would have been my lady Protectress's poet: he writ once a copy in praise of her beauty ; but her Highness gave for it but an old half-crown piece in gold, which she had hoarded up before these troubles, and that discouraged him from any further applications to court." She is said to have had a defect in one of her eyes; and as even Waller neglected to celebrate her beauty, there can be little question as to her want of comeliness.
The passage which has been just quoted from Cowley, contains a double satire. The hoarding of the half-crown piece has evidently reference to her supposed thriftiness. "She very frugally housewifed it," says James Heath," and would nicely and finically tax the expensive unthriftiness (as she said) of the other woman Maria who lived there before her."
A very curious pamphlet, entitled the "Court and Kitchen of Mrs. Joan Cromwell", would appear to have been the production of some disappointed denizen of the royal kitchen, who mingles the decline of cookery with the decline of the empire, and sighs over the economy of the protectoral entertainments, compared with former banquets and former magnificence. Altogether, the work comprises little more than an insignificant and scurrilous attack on the private character and household dispensation of the Protectress, against whom the author apparently bears a strong personal pique.
The abuse is shortly afterwards repeated. "Much ado had she at first to raise her mind and deportment to this sovereign grandeur; and very difficult it was for her to lay aside those impertinent meannesses of her private fortune: like the bride-cat, by Venus's favour metamorphosed into a comely virgin, that could not forbear catching at mice, she could not comport with her present condition, nor forget the common converse and affairs of life. But like some kitchen-maid, preferred by the lust of some rich and noble dotard, was ashamed of her sudden and gaudy bravery, and for a while skulked up and down the house, till the fawning observance and reverences of her slaves had raised her to a confidence, not long after sublimed into an impudence." Her behaviour, however, on her elevation is somewhat differently represented by Edmund Ludlow. The republican, who knew her personally and well, informs us that when her husband changed his residence from the cockpit at Whitehall to the royal palace, she was at first anything but gratified with the splendid change in her domestic arrangements. Heath, on the contrary asserts, that "she was trained up and made the waiting woman of Cromwell's providence, and lady rampant of his successful greatness, which she personated afterwards as imperiously as himself."
In a curious pasquinade of the period, entitled "The Cuckoo's Nest at Westminster," there is introduced the following ludicrous dialogue between the Protectress and Lady Fairfax. This broadside was printed in 1648, some years previous to Cromwell's inauguration in the Protectorship. Its value consists in exhibiting how early and how generally the Lord Protectors views of personal aggrandizement were seen through by his contemporaries.
The two charges, of intemperance and a love of intrigue, which have been brought against the Protectress, rest almost entirely on the authority of an indecent and scurrilous pamphlet, entitled "News from the New Exchange." John Heneage Jesse opinion "its venomous absurdities are unworthy of notice".
Setting aside mere assertion and party invective, it is not difficult to ascertain the real character of the Protectress. She may have had petty meannesses as well as private virtues, but there seem to have been no marked features in her character, nothing in fact which raised her above any ordinary woman. Lilburne evidently implies that she possessed a certain influence over her husband, since he accuses her of having disposed of military appointments during the generalship of Cromwell. Granger also appears to be of the same opinion. — " It has been asserted," he says, " that she was as deeply interested herself in steering the helm, as she had often done in turning the spit; and that she was as constant a spur to her husband in the career of his ambition, as she had been to her servants in their culinary employments." All that we know, however, of the life and character of the Protectress would tend to liberate her from these charges. She seems to have laudably confined herself to the details of domestic life, nor is there any authenticated instance of her having exercised the slightest political influence over her husband. Cromwell was himself too stern in his nature to be much influenced by women, and too cautious to entrust them with his intrigues. He appears, therefore, to have been by no means forward in making her a sharer in that power, a portion of which a strong-minded woman might nevertheless have contrived to obtain. Besides, not one of her relations were partakers of her greatness, and Cromwell's behaviour to her appears throughout to have been rather that of a man who respects his wife as the mother of his children, than for any mental or personal qualifications of her own.
The great argument against her having been a participator in his ambitious views, is the singular and undoubted fact that she endeavoured to persuade her husband to recall the young King. As most of her offspring were royalists, and as children are more frequently biassed by the example and opinions of the mother, probably she was little gratified with the usurpation of her husband. Thus, what we really know of the Protectress inclines us to take part with her panegyrists. She has, at least, the negative praise of not having outstepped the modesty of her sex, by obtruding her name unnecessarily on the public.
Only one of her letters is said to be extant. It was found among Milton's State Papers, and is addressed to the Protector. It is merely the affectionate epistle of a homely wife to her absent husband, and is scarcely worth transcribing. The orthography is wretched, even for the period in which it was written. We must not omit to mention, as a favourable trait in her character, that the Protectress maintained six daughters of clergymen, whom she constantly employed at needlework in her own apartments.
After the death of her husband, and the abdication of her son Richard, at a time when the Cromwells had ceased to retain the least influence in affairs of state, the army paid her the compliment of considering her wants, and compelled the Parliament to settle on her a suitable maintenance. The Restoration, however, following shortly afterwards, she thought it necessary to seek safety in flight, and, with this view, had collected together a large quantity of valuables, with the intention of getting them conveyed out of the kingdom. But her design becoming known to the council of state, a survey was ordered to be held on them, and several articles belonging to the royal family being discovered, she was obliged to depart without even such insignificant remains of her former greatness.
The seizure of these articles is announced in the journals of the period. " Whitehall, May 12, 1660. Information being given that there were several of his Majesty's goods at a fruiterer's warehouse near the Three Cranes, in Thames Street, London, which were there kept as the goods of Mrs. Eliz. Cromwell, wife to Oliver Cromwell, deceased, sometimes called Protector, and it being not very improbable that the said Mrs. Cromwell might convey away some such goods, the Council ordered persons to view the same."
"May 16, 1660. Amongst the goods that were pretended to be Mrs. Cromwell's, at the fruiterer's warehouse, are discovered some pictures, and other things belonging to his Majesty: the remainder lay attached in the custody of Lieut. Col. Cox."
Granger was assured that, after the downfall of her family, the Protectress resided for some time in Switzerland, but the fact is unsupported by other evidence. She certainly retired for a short period into Wales, where she remained till the excitement incident on the Restoration had in some degree subsided. She then moved to the house of her son-in-law, John Claypole, at Norborough in Northhamptonshire, where she remained until she died in November 1665 and was buried in Northborough church on 19 November.
List of children.
Elizabeth Cromwell died in 1665 and five of her nine children survived her as well as numerous grandchildren.
Depictions in film.
In the 1970 film "Cromwell", the part of Elizabeth, Oliver Cromwell's wife, was played by Zena Walker. The part of Oliver Cromwell was played by Irish actor Richard Harris.

Théâtre du Vaudeville

The Théâtre du Vaudeville (today the Gaumont Opéra cinema) was a theatre in Paris. It opened on 12 January 1792 on rue de Chartres. Its directors, Piis and Barré, mainly put on "petites pièces mêlées de couplets sur des airs connus", including vaudevilles.
After it was burned down in 1838, the Vaudeville temporarily based itself on boulevard de Bonne-Nouvelle before in 1841 setting up in the Salle de la Bourse on the Place de la Bourse in the 2e arrondissement. This building was demolished in 1869. Eugène Labiche and Henri Meilhac put on several of their works there, and it also hosted Jules Verne's play "Onze jours de siège" (1861). Other writers whose works were put on there were Edmond Gondinet, Alexandre Bisson, Théophile Marion Dumersan, Jean-François Bayard, Narcisse Fournier and Gaston Arman de Caillavet.
In 1852, "La Dame aux camélias" by Alexandre Dumas fils was put on here. For the first time in the era, there were over 100 consecutive performances. Verdi was in the audience at this theatre and wrote "La Traviata" (1853) based on the play.
From 1866 to 1868, a new Théâtre du Vaudeville was built on boulevard des Capucines, at the corner of Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, in the 9e arrondissement. In 1927, this building was acquired by Paramount and transformed into the cinema it is today, under the name the Paramount Opéra then (from 31 October 2007) the Gaumont Opéra. It has seven auditoria and is served by Opéra on the Paris Metro.

Centre for the Study of African Economies

The Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE) has been undertaking research on Africa since 1986, and is thought to be one of the largest concentrations of academic economists and social scientists working on Africa outside the continent itself. It is part of the Department of Economics under the Social Sciences Division at Oxford University. The centre is located jointly at the Department (Manor Rd Building) and St.Antony's College. Its research has been funded by the ESRC, DfID, UNIDO and the World Bank, among others.
The Centre applies modern research methods to Africa's economic problems. Research is both microeconomic, with a focus on the problems facing individual producers (farms and firms) in Africa, and macroeconomic. It ranges from studies on how to make health care more cost-effective in rural Ethiopia (by spending money on drugs and equipment rather than building more clinics), to the determinants of inflation in Kenya, to the constraints on investment in manufacturing. The Centre undertakes its own surveys in Africa and elsewhere.
The Centre also trains doctoral students. Former students are now employed in African universities and research institutions, as well as in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
The Centre produces the "Journal of African Economies", published by Oxford University Press (OUP), as well as its own members' Working Paper Series.

Battle of Kumegawa

The was part of the decisive Kōzuke-Musashi Campaign during the Genkō War in Japan that ultimately ended the Kamakura Shogunate. Fought in present day Higashimurayama at the foot of the Hachikokuyama ridge on May 12, 1333, it pitted the anti-shogunate imperial forces led by Nitta Yoshisada against the forces of the Hōjō Shogun. The battle was an immediate follow on from the previous day's nearby Battle of Kotesashi.
The battle.
At dawn on May 12, the Imperial forces advanced upon the Shogunate forces' position at the via the Kamakura Kaido highway. Since the previous day's battle at Kotesashi was indecisive, both sides had expected the battle to continue. The chosen battlefield was a plain crisscrossed by small rivers and bordered by low-lying ridges. The geography gave the mounted warriors room to maneuver with their commanders overlooking the battle from the surrounding ridges such as where Nitta raised his banner at Hachikokuyama.
The Taiheiki chronicles what happened. The Shogunate forces formed a large mass with intention of encompassing the Imperial forces. The Imperial forces formed a wedge to protect its center. With neither side gaining immediate advantage, the battle continued until losses forced the Shogun's forces to retreat. Losses were reported as relatively light for the Imperial forces but heavy for the Shogun's.
Result.
The result was a victory for the Imperial forces; having grown weary from two days of heavy fighting, they rested at the battlefield. The Shogunate forces retreated south to Bubaigawara to await reinforcements.
Aftermath.
The two armies fought again three days later at Bubaigawara and Sekido. In less than one week, Nitta led the Imperial forces 50 kilometers south and finally eliminated the Shogun's forces during the Siege of Kamakura.

Platinum nanoparticles

Platinum nanoparticles are usually in the form of a suspension or colloid of submicrometre-size particles of platinum in a fluid, usually water. A colloid is technically defined as a stable dispersion of particles in a fluid medium (liquid or gas). 
Platinum nanoparticles can be made with sizes between about 2 and 20 nanometres (nm), depending on reaction conditions. Trillions of platinum nanoparticles are suspended in the colloidal solution of brownish-red or black color. Nanoparticles come in wide variety of shapes including spheres, rods, cubes, and tetrahedra.
Due to the antioxidant properties of the platinum nanoparticles, they are the subject of substantial research, with potential applications in a wide variety of areas, including nanotechnology, catalysis, medicine, and the synthesis of novel materials with unique properties.
Synthesis.
Platinum nanoparticles are made by reduction of hexachloroplatinate. A solution is rapidly stirred while a reducing agent such as hydrogen gas is added, causing platinum ions to be reduced to neutral platinum atoms. As more and more of these platinum atoms form, the solution quickly becomes supersaturated and platinum starts to precipitate in the form of sub-nanometre particles. As the reaction proceeds, platinum atoms are added to these nuclei, which grow in size. If the solution is stirred vigorously enough, the particles will be fairly uniform in size and shape. To prevent the particles from aggregating, some sort of stabilizing agent or stabilizer that sticks to the nanoparticle surface is usually added, such as sodium polyacrylate. They can be functionalized with various organic ligands to create organic-inorganic hybrid materials with advanced functionality.
Biological effects.
Research by Yusei Miyamoto at University of Tokyo, Japan, resulted in the use of platinum nanoparticles of the size 2-3 nm to increase the lifespan of the roundworm "Caenorhabditis elegans".
Nanoparticles may present possible safety issues both medically and environmentally. Most of these issues usually arise due to the high surface-to-volume ratio, which can make the particles of some metals very reactive or catalytic. In particular, inhaled nanoparticles can pose health risks, and may cause inflammation and disease in the lung. They are able to pass through cell membranes in organisms and their interactions with biological systems are relatively unknown.

Stavanger Socialdemokrat

Stavanger Socialdemokrat was a Norwegian newspaper, published in Stavanger in Rogaland county. It was affiliated with the Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway.
"Stavanger Socialdemokrat" was started in 1921, the same year the Social Democratic Labour Party broke away from the Norwegian Labour Party. In 1927 the Social Democratic Labour Party reconciled with the Labour Party, and the two parties again became one. At the same time, "Stavanger Socialdemokrat" ceased to exist.

Fred Fitzgibbon

Fred Fitzgibbon (22 October 1917 - 24 January 1999) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Carlton in the VFL during the 1940s.
Fitzgibbon spent his early career at Victorian Football Association (VFA) club Brunswick but when the VFA suspended the competition in 1942 due to the war, he decided to switch leagues and joined Carlton. 
Used mainly as a wingman, Fitzgibbon became one of Carlton's most physically aggressive players which at times saw him front the tribunal. The most notable suspensions came in the 1945 finals series and began with a four-match suspension for king-hitting Collingwood forward Len Hustler in the Preliminary Final, which meant he had to watch that year's premiership from the stands.
The Grand Final was marred by many instances of violence, and when teammate Jim Mooring was flattened, Fitzgibbon jumped the fence in his street clothes to take part in a bench-clearing brawl, and exchanged punches with South's Ted Whitfield before police ejected him from the ground. Fitzgibbon was suspended for an additional four matches.
He played every game in the 1947 season, including Carlton's one point win over Essendon in the 1947 Grand Final, to ensure the 1945 suspension wouldn't cost him the chance of playing in a premiership.

United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific

The United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific (USASTAF) was a World War II command and control authority of the strategic United States Army Air Forces in the Pacific Theater.
History.
USASTAF was the Pacific counterpart of the United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF). Its mission was to coordinate strategic bombing of the Japanese Home Islands during the expected Invasion of Japan. The atomic bombings of Japan made this unnecessary.
Establishment.
The Joint Chiefs agreed to the established of the USASTAF on 2 July 1945, it would have a headquarters in Guam and be commanded by General Carl Andrew "Tooey" Spaatz, and consisted of the combat commands (VII Fighter Command, XXI Bomber Command) of the Twentieth Air Force and the Eighth Air Force when redeployed from the European Theater of Operations (ETO) to Okinawa. General Curtis E. Lemay was appointed Spaatz's Chief of Staff.
Guam was the headquarters of the XXI Bomber Command and until the arrival of the Eighth Air Force would provide the bulk of men and equipment of the new command. On 16 July the headquarters of the Twentieth Air Force was officially moved from Washington, DC to Harmon Field, Guam; the headquarters of the XX Bomber Command was inactivated, effective 18 July, and the "Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron, XXI Bomber Command" was redesignated "Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron, Twentieth Air Force"; thus the Bomber Commands were brought to an end as actual establishments and their wings passed to direct control of Headquarters Twentieth Air Force of which Major General Curtis E. LeMay took command on that date. On the same day the Eighth was reassigned to Okinawa, as a paper transfer as it arrived without men or equipment. Spaatz arrived in theater on 29 July and began organizing his forces—a task he had not completed by the war's end.
The primary combat missions carried out by USASTAF forces were the firebombing of Japanese cities and industrial targets during June and July 1945 by Twentieth Air Force. No Eighth Air Force combat missions were flown. The atomic bombing raids on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were carried out by direct order of USAAF Chief of Staff General Henry "Hap" Arnold" though the 509th Composite Group.
Inactivation.
On 6 December 1945 USASTAF was abolished by the inactivation of its headquarters and headquarters squadron. Its personnel, equipment and aircraft were assigned to Pacific Air Command, United States Army (PACUSA) which was assigned to United States Army Forces, Pacific (AFPAC).
PACUSA was reassigned to Tokyo, Japan on 17 May 1946. The USAAF Air Forces in the Pacific region were reassigned as follows:
There was also the Pacific Air Service Command, later Far East Air Service Command which was attached to HQ PACUSA.
The USAAF Air Forces in the Pacific region had a total of six very-heavy-bombardment groups, nine fighter groups, two light-bombardment groups, and two troop-carrier groups, along with three tactical reconnaissance, five air-sea rescue, five night-fighter, two liaison, two tow-target, and two very-long-range photographic-reconnaissance squadrons. Although by December 1945 most of these units were in the process of being reassigned to the United States or demobilzing in-theater and the personnel returning to processing centers for discharge.

The CILANE has no "president" but rather a Coordinator elected for three years. His role is to prepare and conduct the spring and autumn sessions of the CILANE and to carry out its decisions. It enables each national association to carry out projects together. It holds an international congress every three years.
The spring session takes place traditionally in Paris, the seat of the CILANE. In autumn the sessions are held in one of the other member countries. Significantly, most of the organisations represented in CILANE are private initiatives, particularly in nations where titles of nobility are no longer recognised and therefore unregulated by law.
The delegates represent their Nobility Associations at the CILANE for the following countries: Belgium, France, Italy, Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Netherlands, Papal Nobility, United Kingdom, Denmark and Hungary

North West Company Post

The North West Company Fur Post is a reconstructed fur trade post on the Snake River west of Pine City, Minnesota. The post was established by John Sayer, a partner in the North West Company, in the fall of 1804, and built by his crew of voyageurs. The site operated for several years, although its exact period of operation is unknown. It was later destroyed by fire.
The North West Company was formed in Montreal in the mid-1780s from a partnership of merchants. The company established a large post at Grand Portage and built several other forts to house wintering voyageurs. Besides the Snake River forts, they also established forts at Fond du Lac (now part of modern Duluth), Big Sandy Lake, and Leech Lake. A typical fort would include a dwelling for the clerk, a storehouse, and a bunkhouse for the ten to twenty voyageurs who spent the winter. During the winters, the voyageurs would collect the pelts of beaver, otter, muskrat, deer, bear, marten, and other animals whose hides were useful. Dakota and Ojibwe men would kill and skin the animals, while the women would prepare the hides by stretching and drying them. The hides were typically regarded as the women's property, so they would arrange the sales with the clerk of the trading post. In return, the clerks would supply the Indians with trade goods, such as firearms, blankets, and cooking utensils. The fur trade turned out to be mutually beneficial, since the Indians received the products of early industrialization. The furs were sold to Europeans who made felt hats and fur coats.
The site was rediscovered in 1931 by a local Pine City resident, who found artifacts such as musket flints in the soil. He returned to the site over the next three decades to explore it. In 1958, he found a book, "Five Fur traders in the North West", that contained the journal of John Sayer. The Pine City resident contacted the Minnesota Historical Society and explained what he had found. The Minnesota Historical Society performed some field testing in 1963 to determine the character of the site. In 1965 through 1967, a group of Hamline University students excavated the site and recovered hundreds of artifacts. The Minnesota Historical Society reconstructed the rowhouse in 1968 and 1969 and opened the site as a historic site in 1970. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.
Today the post has been reconstructed for the period from the winter of 1804-05. The museum is open in the summer, and costumed guides help interpret the site. The visitor center features exhibits about the post's history, a great room, fireplace and retail store.

SVNKit

SVNKit is an Open Source, pure Java software library for working with the Subversion version control system. It is free to use on opensource projects but requires that you buy a commercial license to use to develop with proprietary software. It implements virtually all Subversion features and provides API to work with Subversion working copies, access and manipulate Subversion repositories.
Features.
Major SVNKit features are:
Features available in the native Subversion client, but missing in SVNKit:
Command line client.
Part of SVNKit library is a command line Subversion client implemented on top of SVNKit. It is compatible with the native Subversion command line client and may be used in environments where it is not possible to install native Subversion or from within applications (e.g. Apache Ant scripts) that could not rely on the native Subversion presence.
Competition.
JavaHL is a JNI wrapper of the native Subversion C code. JavaHL could be used instead of SVNKit in most of the use cases.
However, SVNKit implements JavaHL API and thus both SVNKit and Subversion JNI wrapper could be used simultaneously to let user choose what suits his environment better. A fair comparison of SVNKit and JavaHL can be found in Subversion Book. Both SVNKit and JavaHL have their own advantages and disadvantages.
Licensing.
SVNKit implements a dual licensing scheme. By default SVNKit is licensed under a licensing terms similar to those of GPL, that means, in general, that there are no restrictions or limitations on SVNKit usage as long as it is being used in an Open Source project.
For closed-source projects, a commercial license has to be purchased.
History.
In 2005, a software company called TMate Software Ltd. announced the 1.0.0 release of JavaSVN — a pure Java Subversion client library. Since then, the project has been renamed to SVNKit.
Versions of SVNKit prior to 0.9.3 were licensed under BSD license terms, later licensing scheme has been changed to dual licensing.
Adoption.
SVNKit is known to be used in:

Dana (given name)

Dana is a given name used for both females and males. It was among the 100 most popular names given to girls born in the United States between 1960 and 1990. It has since fallen in popularity and was ranked the 446th most popular name given to girls born in the United States in 2007. As a male forename it is well known in the United States, being in the 314th rank out of 1,219 in the 1990 U.S. Census. 
The name has multiple derivations. It may come from "Dane" (from Denmark), the meaning of the common surname. It is also occasionally regarded as a feminine version of Daniel or a short version of feminine names such as Bogdana or Yordana. Dana is also an alternate spelling of the name for Danu, a Celtic fertility goddess. In Persian, the word literally means "knowledgeable", and some speculate that the name is first used as a first name in "Shahnameh". The name is used in Persian for both female and male sexes. "Dana" or "Danah", in Arabic, means "the most perfectly sized, valuable and beautiful pearl". This name is used mainly by Arabs of the Persian Gulf, due to their traditional pearl diving professions wherein they gave different type of pearls names. It is used in the Arab world as a female name. In Hebrew, the name Dana means "arbiter" or "God is my judge".

Nicolas de Neufville de Villeroy

Nicolas V de Neufville de Villeroy (14 October 1598 – 28 November 1685) was a French nobleman and marshal of France. He was marquis then (from 1651) 1st duke of Villeroy and (from 1663) peer of France, marquis d'Alincourt and lord of Magny, and acted as governor of the young Louis XIV. His son François succeeded him as duke. He was the lover of Catherine-Charlotte de Gramont.
Life.
He was the son of Charles de Neufville (1566–1642), marquis de Villeroy et d'Alincourt, and his second wife, Jacqueline de Harlay de Sancy.
Nicolas de Neufville studied at the court of Louis XIII as an enfant d’honneur. In 1615, he was made governor of the Lyonnais under his father's supervision – an effective governor, he served in that post until his father's death in 1642. He served in Italy with Lesdiguières and was promoted to marshal of France on 20 October 1646 thanks to being the protégé of cardinal Jules Mazarin.
In March 1646, the queen-mother made marshal de Villeroy governor of Louis XIV, under Mazarin's authoritym chosen as "surintendent for the government and conduct of the king". It is difficult to attribute him any good or bad influence in the young king's education. He was made duke of Villeroy in September 1651 and admitted to the peerage of France in 1663. He served as Grand Master of France at Louis XIV's coronation and was made a knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit on 31 December 1661. Louis XIV also made him head of the Conseil royal des finances in 1661, a role (of particular importance at the time of the suppression of the surintendance des finances, but becoming largely honorific) he held until his death.
Hotel de Villeroy.
In 1640 Nicolas de Villeroy built a "hôtel particulier" on 34 rue des Bourdonnais in the center of Paris in the district of les Halles. The House was built on the grounds of a former mansion already belonging to the Villeroy family since 1370. It has a second entrance from 9 rue des Dechargeurs
The beautiful courtyard of the building was frequently visited by the young King Louis XIV who lived in the nearby Palais Royal and played there as a child with his brother Prince Philippe d'Orleans.
The Hotel de Villeroy still exists today, and in 1984 it was protected as a historic monument. Part of it is today used by the International Exposition center Cremerie de Paris which hosted in June 2012 the Nike Barber Shop. The Barber Shop was the center of the advertisement campaign of the US company Nike, Inc. Information tours are organized every month giving the public the possibility to discover the staircase and the courtyard of the Hotel de Villeroy.
Family.
Nicolas married on 11 July 1617 to Madeleine de Blanchefort de Créquy.
They had four children:

<doc id="19230295" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19230295" title="Retrospective diagnosis">
Retrospective diagnosis

A retrospective diagnosis (also retrodiagnosis or posthumous diagnosis) is the practice of identifying an illness in a historical figure using modern knowledge, methods and disease classifications. Alternatively, it can be the more general attempt to give a modern name to an ancient and ill-defined scourge or plague.
Retrospective diagnosis is practised by medical historians, general historians and the media with varying degrees of scholarship. At its worst it may become "little more than a game, with ill-defined rules and little academic credibility." The process often requires "translating between linguistic and conceptual worlds separated by several centuries", and assumes our modern disease concepts and categories are privileged. Crude attempts at retrospective diagnosis fail to be sensitive to historical context, may treat historical and religious records as scientific evidence, or ascribe pathology to behaviours that require none. The understanding of the history of illness can benefit from modern science. For example, knowledge of the insect vectors of malaria and yellow fever can be used to explain the changes in extent of those diseases caused by drainage or urbanisation in historical times.
The practice of retrospective diagnosis has been mocked in parody, where characters from fiction are "diagnosed". Squirrel Nutkin may have had Tourette syndrome and Tiny Tim could have suffered from distal renal tubular acidosis (type I).
The term "retrospective diagnosis" is also sometimes used by a clinical pathologist to describe a medical diagnosis in a person made some time after the original illness has resolved or after death. In such cases, analysis of a physical specimen may yield a confident medical diagnosis. The search for the origin of AIDS has involved posthumous diagnosis of AIDS in people who died decades before the disease was first identified. Another example is where analysis of preserved umbilical cord tissue enables the diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus infection in a patient who had later developed a central nervous system disorder.

Geography of Port Phillip

Port Phillip, sometimes referred to as Port Phillip Bay, is a large bay in southern Victoria, Australia, 1,930 km² (476,900 acres) in area, with a coastline length of . The bay is extremely shallow for its size, but mostly navigable. The deepest portion is only 24 m (80 ft), and half the region is shallower than 8 m. Its volume is around 25 km³. The city of Melbourne is located at its northern end, near the mouth of the Yarra River.
Port Phillip is home to a vast array of geographic features typically found in bays, such as beaches, points, islands and smaller bays, as well as being the drainage point of many major rivers and creeks in Central Victoria. All features here are listed clockwise from the mouth of the Yarra River.
Beaches.
Port Phillip hosts many beaches, most of which are flat, shallow and long, with very small breaks making swimming quite safe. This attracts many tourists, mostly families, to the beaches of Port Phillip during the summer months and school holidays. Water sports such as body boarding and surfing are difficult or impossible, except in extreme weather conditions. Most sandy beaches are located on the bay's northern, eastern and southern shorelines, while the western shorelines host a few sandy beaches, there mostly exists a greater variety of beaches, swampy wetlands and mangroves. The occasional pebble beach and rocky cliffs can also be found, mostly in the southern reaches. Major beaches include:

The Hof Aza Regional Council was a regional council of Israel until 2005 when its residents were evicted from their homes and the area was liquidated as part of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan. The seat was in Neve Dekalim. The public buildings of the regional council and adjacent strip mall in Neve Dekalim were not destroyed and the Palestinian Al-Aqsa University opened a campus on the site shortly after the Israeli evacuation.
Settlements.
The Hof Aza Regional Council included twenty-one civilian Israeli settlements:

Aquarium

An aquarium (plural aquariums or aquaria) is a vivarium consisting of at least one transparent side in which water-dwelling plants or animals are kept. Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians, marine mammals, turtles, and aquatic plants. The term combines the Latin root "aqua", meaning water, with the suffix "-arium", meaning "a place for relating to".
An aquarist owns fish or maintains an aquarium, typically constructed of glass or high-strength acrylic plastic. Cuboid aquaria are also known as fish tanks or simply tanks, while bowl-shaped aquaria are also known as fish bowls. Size can range from a small glass bowl to immense public aquaria. Specialized equipment maintains appropriate water quality and other characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents.
History and popularization.
Antiquity.
In the Roman Empire, the first fish to be brought indoors was the sea barbel, which was kept under guest beds in small tanks made of marble. Introduction of glass panes around the year 50 AD allowed Romans to replace one wall of marble tanks, improving their view of the fish. In 1369, the Chinese Emperor, Hóngwǔ, established a porcelain company that produced large porcelain tubs for maintaining goldfish; over time, people produced tubs that approached the shape of modern fish bowls. Leonhard Baldner, who wrote "Vogel-, Fisch- und Tierbuch" (Bird, Fish, and Animal Book) in 1666, maintained weather loaches and newts.
Nineteenth century.
In 1836, soon after his invention of the Wardian case, Dr. Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward proposed to use his tanks for tropical animals. In 1841 he did so, though only with aquatic plants and toy fish. However, he soon housed real animals. In 1838, Félix Dujardin noted owning a saltwater aquarium, though he did not use the term. In 1846, Anne Thynne maintained stony corals and seaweed for almost three years, and was credited as the creator of the first balanced marine aquarium in London. At about the same time, Robert Warington experimented with a 13-gallon container, which contained goldfish, eelgrass, and snails, creating one of the first stable aquaria. He published his findings in 1850 in the Chemical Society's journal.
The keeping of fish in an aquarium became a popular hobby and spread quickly. In the United Kingdom, it became popular after ornate aquaria in cast-iron frames were featured at the Great Exhibition of 1851. In 1853, the first large public aquarium opened in the London Zoo and came to be known as the Fish House. Philip Henry Gosse was the first person to actually use the word "aquarium", opting for this term (instead of "aquatic vivarium" or "aqua-vivarium") in 1854 in his book "The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of the Deep Sea". In this book, Gosse primarily discussed saltwater aquaria. In the 1850s, the aquarium became a fad in the United Kingdom.
Tank designs and techniques for maintaining water quality were developed by Warington, later cooperating with Gosse until his critical review of the tank water composition. Edward Edwards developed these glass-fronted aquaria in his 1858 patent for a "dark-water-chamber slope-back tank", with water slowly circulating to a reservoir beneath. 
Germans soon rivaled the British in their interest. In 1854, an anonymous author had two articles published about the saltwater aquaria of the United Kingdom: "Die Gartenlaube" (The Garden House) entitled "Der Ocean auf dem Tische" (The Ocean on the Table). However, in 1856, "Der See im Glase" (The Lake in a Glass) was published, discussing freshwater aquaria, which were much easier to maintain in landlocked areas. In 1862 William Alford Lloyd, then bankrupt because of the craze in England being over, moved to Grindel Dammthor, Hamburg, to supervise the installation of the circulating system and tanks at the Hamburg Aquarium. During the 1870s, some of the first aquarist societies were appearing in Germany. The United States soon followed. Published in 1858, Henry D. Butler's "The Family Aquarium" was one of the first books written in the United States solely about the aquarium. According to the July issue of "The North American Review" of the same year, William Stimson may have owned some of the first functional aquaria, and had as many as seven or eight. The first aquarist society in the United States was founded in New York City in 1893, followed by others. The "New York Aquarium Journal", first published in October 1876, is considered to be the world's first aquarium magazine.
In the Victorian era in the United Kingdom, a common design for the home aquarium was a glass front with the other sides made of wood (made watertight with a pitch coating). The bottom would be made of slate and heated from below. More advanced systems soon began to be introduced, along with tanks of glass in metal frames. During the latter half of the 19th century, a variety of aquarium designs were explored, such as hanging the aquarium on a wall, mounting it as part of a window, or even combining it with a birdcage. 
Twentieth century.
Around 1908, the first mechanical aquarium air pump was invented, powered by running water, instead of electricity. The introduction of the air pump into the hobby is considered by several historians of the hobby to be a pivotal moment in its development.
Aquaria became more widely popular as houses had an electricity supply after World War I. Electricity allowed artificial lighting, as well as aeration, filtration, and heating of the water. Initially, amateur aquarists kept native fish (with the exception of goldfish); the availability of exotic species from overseas further increased the popularity of the aquarium. Jugs made from a variety of materials were used to import fish from overseas, with a bicycle foot pump for aeration. Plastic shipping bags were introduced in the 1950s, making it easier to ship fish. The eventual availability of air freight allowed fish to be successfully imported from distant regions. In the 1960s, metal frames made marine aquaria almost impossible due to corrosion, but the development of tar and silicone sealant allowed the first all-glass aquaria made by Martin Horowitz in Los Angeles, CA. The frames remained, however, though purely for aesthetic reasons.
In the United States, as of 1996, aquarium keeping is the second-most popular hobby after stamp collecting. In 1999, an estimated 9.6 million US households owned an aquarium. Figures from the 2005/2006 APPMA National Pet Owners Survey report that Americans own approximately 139 million freshwater fish and 9.6 million saltwater fish. Estimates of the numbers of fish kept in aquaria in Germany suggest at least 36 million. The hobby has the strongest following in Europe, Asia, and North America. In the United States, 40% of aquarists maintain two or more tanks.
Design.
Materials.
Most aquaria consist of glass panes bonded together by 100% silicone sealant, with plastic frames attached to the upper and lower edges for decoration. The glass aquarium is standard for sizes up to about . However, glass as a material is brittle and has very little give before fracturing, though generally the sealant fails first. Aquaria are made in a variety of shapes, such as cuboid, hexagonal, angled to fit in a corner (L-shaped), and bow-front (the front side curves outwards). Fish bowls are generally either made of plastic or glass, and are either spherical or some other round configuration in shape.
The very first modern aquarium made of glass was developed in the 19th century by Robert Warrington. During the Victorian age, glass aquaria commonly had slate or steel bottoms, which allowed the aquaria to be heated underneath with an open-flame heat source. The aquaria in those days had the glass panels attached with metal frames and sealed with putty. These metal-framed aquaria were still available on the market until the mid-1960s, when the modern, silicone-sealed style replaced them. Acrylic tanks were not generally available to the public until the 1970s.
Although glass aquaria are usually preferred by aquarists over the acrylic ones because of their resistance to scratching and much more accessible price, they come with several disadvantages. Not only are they not as crack-resistant as acrylic tanks, but they are also nearly twice as heavy as the latter. They also provide less insulation than acrylic aquaria and are not made in as many interesting shapes. Many aquarists or beginners who want to get fish as pets find it particularly onerous that many online suppliers will not ship glass aquaria because of the high potential for cracking and the high weight, which increases the cost of shipping. However, glass tanks are more convenient for other aquarists because unlike acrylic, glass does not yellow over time, and also because glass tanks do not need as much support as acrylic aquaria.
Though the price is one of the main considerations for aquarists when deciding which of these two types of aquaria to purchase, for very large tanks, the price difference tends to disappear.
Acrylic aquaria are the primary competitor with glass. Acrylic aquaria are stronger than glass, and much lighter. Acrylic-soluble cements are used to directly fuse acrylic together (as opposed to simply sealing the seam). Acrylic allows for the formation of unusual shapes, such as the hexagonal tank. Compared to glass, acrylics are easy to scratch; but unlike glass, it is possible to polish out scratches in acrylic.
Laminated glass is sometimes used, which combines the advantages of both glass and acrylic.
Large aquaria might instead use stronger materials such as fiberglass-reinforced plastics. However, this material is not transparent. Reinforced concrete is used for aquaria where weight and space are not factors. Concrete must be coated with a waterproof layer to prevent the water from breaking down the concrete, as well as preventing contamination of the water by the concrete.
Styles.
Aquariums have been fashioned into coffee tables, sinks, and even toilets. Another such example is the MacQuarium, an aquarium made from the shell of an Apple Macintosh computer. In recent years, elaborate custom-designed home aquariums costing hundreds of thousands of dollars have become status symbols—according to "The New York Times", "among people of means, a dazzling aquarium is one of the last surefire ways to impress their peers."
A kreisel tank is a circular aquarium designed to hold delicate animals such as jellyfish. These aquariums provide slow, circular water flow with a bare minimum of interior hardware, to prevent delicate animals from becoming injured by pumps or the tank itself. Originally a German design ("kreisel" means spinning top), the tank has no sharp corners, and keeps the housed animals away from the plumbing. Water moving into the tank gives a gentle flow that keeps the inhabitants suspended, and water leaves the tank through a screen which prevents jellyfish from being sucked up into the pump intake or overflow line. There are several types of kreisel tanks. In a true kreisel, a circular tank has a circular, submerged lid. Pseudokreisels are "U" or semicircle shaped, usually without a lid. Stretch kreisels are a "double gyre" kreisel design, where the tank length is at least twice the height. Using two downwelling inlets on both sides of the tank lets gravity create two gyres in the tank. A single downwelling inlet may be used in the middle as well. The top of a stretch kreisel may be open or closed with a lid. There may also be screens about midway down the sides of the tank, or at the top on the sides. It is possible to combine these designs; a circular shaped tank is used without a lid or cover, and the surface of the water acts as the continuation of circular flow. It is now possible to start a jellyfish aquarium at home as easily as a regular fish tank.
Another popular setup is the biotope aquarium. A biotope aquarium is a recreation of a specific natural environment. Some of the most popular biotopes are the Amazon river, Rio Negro River, Lake Malawi, Lake Tanganyika, and Lake Victoria. The fish, plants, substrate, rocks, wood, and any other component of the display should match that of the natural environment. It can be a challenge to recreate such environments and most "true" biotopes will only have a few species of fish (if not only one) and invertebrates.
Aquarium size and volume.
An aquarium can range from a small glass bowl containing less than of water to immense public aquaria that house entire ecosystems such as kelp forests. Relatively large home aquaria resist rapid fluctuations of temperature and pH, allowing for greater system stability.
Unfiltered bowl-shaped aquaria are now widely regarded as unsuitable for most fish. Advanced alternatives are now available. In order to keep water conditions at suitable levels, aquariums should contain at least two forms of filtration: biological and mechanical. Chemical filtration should also be considered under some circumstances for optimum water quality. Chemical filtration is frequently achieved via activated carbon, to filter medications, tannins, and/or other known impurities from the water.
Reef aquaria under have a special place in the aquarium hobby; these aquaria, termed nano reefs (when used in reefkeeping), have a small water volume, under 40 liters.
Practical limitations, most notably the weight of water () and internal water pressure (requiring thick glass siding) of a large aquarium, restrict most home aquaria to a maximum of around 1 cubic metre in volume (1000 L, weighing or ). Some aquarists, however, have constructed aquaria of many thousands of litres.
Public aquariums designed for exhibition of large species or environments can be dramatically larger than any home aquarium. The Georgia Aquarium, for example, features an individual aquarium of .
Components.
The typical hobbyist aquarium includes a filtration system, an artificial lighting system, and a heater or chiller depending on the aquarium's inhabitants. Many aquaria incorporate a hood, containing the lights, to decrease evaporation and prevent fish from leaving the aquarium (and anything else from entering the aquarium).
Combined biological and mechanical aquarium filtration systems are common. These either convert ammonia to nitrate (removing nitrogen at the expense of aquatic plants), or to sometimes remove phosphate. Filter media can house microbes that mediate nitrification. Filtration systems are sometimes the most complex component of home aquaria.
Aquarium heaters combine a heating element with a thermostat, allowing the aquarist to regulate water temperature at a level above that of the surrounding air, whereas coolers and chillers (refrigeration devices) are for use anywhere, such as cold water aquaria, where the ambient room temperature is above the desired tank temperature. Thermometers used include glass alcohol thermometers, adhesive external plastic strip thermometers, and battery-powered LCD thermometers. In addition, some aquarists use air pumps attached to airstones or water pumps to increase water circulation and supply adequate gas exchange at the water surface. Wave-making devices have also been constructed to provide wave action.
An aquarium's physical characteristics form another aspect of aquarium design. Size, lighting conditions, density of floating and rooted plants, placement of bog-wood, creation of caves or overhangs, type of substrate, and other factors (including an aquarium's positioning within a room) can all affect the behavior and survival of tank inhabitants.
An aquarium can be placed on an aquarium stand. Because of the weight of the aquarium, a stand must be strong as well as level. A tank that is not level may distort, leak, or crack. These are often built with cabinets to allow storage, available in many styles to match room decor. Simple metal tank stands are also available. Most aquaria should be placed on polystyrene to cushion any irregularities on the underlying surface or the bottom of the tank itself. However, some tanks have an underframe making this unnecessary.
Aquarium maintenance.
Large volumes of water enable more stability in a tank by diluting effects from death or contamination events that push an aquarium away from equilibrium. The bigger the tank, the easier such a systemic shock is to absorb, because the effects of that event are diluted. For example, the death of the only fish in a three U.S. gallon tank (11 L) causes dramatic changes in the system, while the death of that same fish in a 100 U.S. gallon (400 L) tank with many other fish in it represents only a minor change. For this reason, hobbyists often favor larger tanks, as they require less attention.
Several nutrient cycles are important in the aquarium. Dissolved oxygen enters the system at the surface water-air interface. Similarly, carbon dioxide escapes the system into the air. The phosphate cycle is an important, although often overlooked, nutrient cycle. Sulfur, iron, and micronutrients also cycle through the system, entering as food and exiting as waste. Appropriate handling of the nitrogen cycle, along with supplying an adequately balanced food supply and considered biological loading, is enough to keep these other nutrient cycles in approximate equilibrium.
An aquarium must be maintained regularly to ensure that the fish are kept healthy. Daily maintenance consists of checking the fish for signs of stress and disease. Also, aquarists must make sure that the water has a good quality and it is not cloudy or foamy and the temperature of the water is appropriate for the particular species of fish that live in the aquarium.
Typical weekly maintenance includes changing around 10-20% of the water while cleaning the gravel, or other substrate if the aquarium has one. A good habit is to remove the water being replaced by "vacuuming" the gravel with suitable implements, as this will eliminate uneaten foods and other residues that settle on the substrate. Tap water is not considered to be safe for fish to live in because it contains chemicals that harm the fish, so any tap water used must be treated with a suitable water conditioner, such as a product which removes chlorine and chloramine and neutralises any heavy metals present. The water conditions must be checked both in the tank and in the replacement water, to make sure they are suitable for the species of fish kept.
Water conditions.
The solute content of water is perhaps the most important aspect of water conditions, as total dissolved solids and other constituents dramatically impact basic water chemistry, and therefore how organisms interact with their environment. Salt content, or salinity, is the most basic measure of water conditions. An aquarium may have freshwater (salinity below 500 parts per million), simulating a lake or river environment; brackish water (a salt level of 500 to 30,000 PPM), simulating environments lying between fresh and salt, such as estuaries; and salt water or seawater (a salt level of 30,000 to 40,000 PPM), simulating an ocean environment. Rarely, higher salt concentrations are maintained in specialized tanks for raising brine organisms.
Saltwater is typically alkaline, while the pH (alkalinity or acidicity) of fresh water varies more. Hardness measures overall dissolved mineral content; hard or soft water may be preferred. Hard water is usually alkaline, while soft water is usually neutral to acidic. Dissolved organic content and dissolved gases content are also important factors.
Home aquarists typically use tap water supplied through their local water supply network to fill their tanks. Straight tap water cannot be used in localities that pipe chlorinated water. In the past, it was possible to "condition" the water by simply letting the water stand for a day or two, which allows the chlorine time to dissipate. However, chloramine is now used more often and does not leave the water as readily. Additives formulated to remove chlorine or chloramine are often all that is needed to make the water ready for aquarium use. Brackish or saltwater aquaria require the addition of a commercially available mixture of salts and other minerals.
Some aquarists modify water's alkalinity, hardness, or dissolved content of organics and gases, before adding it to their aquaria. This can be accomplished by additives, such as sodium bicarbonate, to raise pH. Some aquarists filter or purify their water through deionization or reverse osmosis prior to using it. In contrast, public aquaria with large water needs often locate themselves near a natural water source (such as a river, lake, or ocean) to reduce the level of treatment. Some hobbyists use an algae scrubber to filter the water naturally.
Water temperature determines the two most basic aquarium classifications: tropical versus cold water. Most fish and plant species tolerate only a limited temperature range; tropical aquaria, with an average temperature of about , are much more common. Cold water aquaria are for fish that are better suited to a cooler environment. More important than the range is consistency; most organisms are not accustomed to sudden changes in temperatures, which can cause shock and lead to disease. Water temperature can be regulated with a thermostat and heater (or cooler).
Water movement can also be important in simulating a natural ecosystem. Aquarists may prefer anything from still water up to swift currents, depending on the aquarium's inhabitants. Water movement can be controlled via aeration from air pumps, powerheads, and careful design of internal water flow (such as location of filtration system points of inflow and outflow).
Nitrogen cycle.
Of primary concern to the aquarist is management of the waste produced by an aquarium's inhabitants. Fish, invertebrates, fungi, and some bacteria excrete nitrogen waste in the form of ammonia (which converts to ammonium, in acidic water) and must then either pass through the nitrogen cycle or be removed by passing through zeolite. Ammonia is also produced through the decomposition of plant and animal matter, including fecal matter and other detritus. Nitrogen waste products become toxic to fish and other aquarium inhabitants at high concentrations.
The process.
A well-balanced tank contains organisms that are able to metabolize the waste products of other aquarium residents. This process is known in the aquarium hobby as the nitrogen cycle. Bacteria known as nitrifiers (genus "Nitrosomonas") metabolize nitrogen waste. Nitrifying bacteria capture ammonia from the water and metabolize it to produce nitrite. Nitrite is toxic to fish in high concentrations. Another type of bacteria (genus "Nitrospira") converts nitrite into nitrate, a less toxic substance. ("Nitrobacter" bacteria were previously believed to fill this role. While biologically they could theoretically fill the same niche as "Nitrospira", it has recently been found that "Nitrobacter" are not present in detectable levels in established aquaria, while "Nitrospira" are plentiful.) However, commercial products sold as kits to "jump start" the nitrogen cycle often still contain "Nitrobacter".
In addition to bacteria, aquatic plants also eliminate nitrogen waste by metabolizing ammonia and nitrate. When plants metabolize nitrogen compounds, they remove nitrogen from the water by using it to build biomass that decays more slowly than ammonia-driven plankton already dissolved in the water.
Maintaining the nitrogen cycle.
What hobbyists call the nitrogen cycle is only a portion of the complete cycle: nitrogen must be added to the system (usually through food provided to the tank inhabitants), and nitrates accumulate in the water at the end of the process, or become bound in the biomass of plants. The aquarium keeper must remove water once nitrate concentrations grow, or remove plants which have grown from the nitrates.
Hobbyist aquaria often do not have sufficient bacteria populations to adequately denitrify waste. This problem is most often addressed through two filtration solutions: Activated carbon filters absorb nitrogen compounds and other toxins, while biological filters provide a medium designed to enhance bacterial colonization. Activated carbon and other substances, such as ammonia absorbing resins, stop working when their pores fill, so these components have to be replaced regularly.
New aquaria often have problems associated with the nitrogen cycle due to insufficient beneficial bacteria. Therefore fresh water has to be matured before stocking them with fish. There are three basic approaches to this: the "fishless cycle", the "silent cycle" and "slow growth".
In a fishless cycle, small amounts of ammonia are added to an unpopulated tank to feed the bacteria. During this process, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels are tested to monitor progress. The "silent" cycle is basically nothing more than densely stocking the aquarium with fast-growing aquatic plants and relying on them to consume the nitrogen, allowing the necessary bacterial populations time to develop. According to anecdotal reports, the plants can consume nitrogenous waste so efficiently that ammonia and nitrite level spikes seen in more traditional cycling methods are greatly reduced or disappear. "Slow growth" entails slowly increasing the population of fish over a period of 6 to 8 weeks, giving bacteria colonies time to grow and stabilize with the increase in fish waste. This method is usually done with a small starter population of hardier fish which can survive the ammonia and nitrite spikes, whether they are intended to be permanent residents or to be traded out later for the desired occupants.
The largest bacterial populations are found in the filter, where is high water flow and plentiful surface available for their growth, so effective and efficient filtration is vital. Sometimes, a vigorous cleaning of the filter is enough to seriously disturb the biological balance of an aquarium. Therefore, it is recommended to rinse mechanical filters in an outside bucket of aquarium water to dislodge organic materials that contribute to nitrate problems, while preserving bacteria populations. Another safe practice consists of cleaning only half of the filter media during each service, or using two filters, only one of which is cleaned at a time.
Biological load.
The biological load, or bioload, is a measure of the burden placed on the aquarium ecosystem by its inhabitants. High biological loading presents a more complicated tank ecology, which in turn means that equilibrium is easier to upset. Several fundamental constraints on biological loading depend on aquarium size. The water's surface area limits oxygen intake. The bacteria population depends on the physical space they have available to colonize. Physically, only a limited size and number of plants and animals can fit into an aquarium while still providing room for movement. Biologically, biological loading refers to the rate of biological decay in proportion to tank volume. Adding plants to an aquarium will sometimes help greatly with taking up fish waste as plant nutrients. Although an aquarium can be overloaded with fish, an excess of plants is unlikely to cause harm. Decaying plant material, such as decaying plant leaves, can add these nutrients back into the aqaurium if not promptly removed. The bioload is processed by the aquarium's biofilter filtration system.
Calculating capacity.
Limiting factors include the oxygen availability and filtration processing. Aquarists have rules of thumb to estimate the number of fish that can be kept in an aquarium. The examples below are for small freshwater fish; larger freshwater fishes and most marine fishes need much more generous allowances.
Experienced aquarists warn against applying these rules too strictly because they do not consider other important issues such as growth rate, activity level, social behaviour, filtration capacity, total biomass of plant life, and so on. It is better to apply the overall mass and size of a fish per gallon of water, than simply the length. This is because fish of different sizes produce quite differing amounts of waste. Establishing maximum capacity is often a matter of slowly adding fish and monitoring water quality over time, following a trial and error approach.
Other factors affecting capacity.
One variable is differences between fish. Smaller fish consume more oxygen per gram of body weight than larger fish. Labyrinth fish can breathe atmospheric oxygen and do not need as much surface area (however, some of these fish are territorial, and do not appreciate crowding). Barbs also require more surface area than tetras of comparable size.
Oxygen exchange at the surface is an important constraint, and thus the surface area of the aquarium matters. Some aquarists claim that a deeper aquarium holds no more fish than a shallower aquarium with the same surface area. The capacity can be improved by surface movement and water circulation such as through aeration, which not only improves oxygen exchange, but also waste decomposition rates.
Waste density is another variable. Decomposition in solution consumes oxygen. Oxygen dissolves less readily in warmer water; this is a double-edged sword since warmer temperatures make fish more active, so they consume more oxygen.
In addition to bioload/chemical considerations, aquarists also consider the mutual compatibility of the fish. For instance, predatory fish are usually not kept with small, passive species, and territorial fish are often unsuitable tankmates for shoaling species. Furthermore, fish tend to fare better if given tanks conducive to their size. That is, large fish need large tanks and small fish can do well in smaller tanks. Lastly, the tank can become overcrowded without being overstocked. In other words, the aquarium can be suitable with regard to filtration capacity, oxygen load, and water, yet still be so crowded that the inhabitants are uncomfortable.
Aquarium classifications.
From the outdoor ponds and glass jars of antiquity, modern aquaria have evolved into a wide range of specialized systems. Individual aquaria can vary in size from a small bowl large enough for only a single small fish, to the huge public aquaria that can simulate entire marine ecosystems.
One way to classify aquaria is by salinity. Freshwater aquaria are the most popular due to their lower cost. More expensive and complex equipment is required to set up and maintain marine aquaria. Marine aquaria frequently feature a diverse range of invertebrates in addition to species of fish. Brackish water aquaria combine elements of both marine and freshwater fishkeeping. Fish kept in brackish water aquaria generally come from habitats with varying salinity, such as mangrove swamps and estuaries. Subtypes exist within these types, such as the reef aquarium, a typically smaller marine aquarium that houses coral.
Another classification is by temperature range. Many aquarists choose a tropical aquarium because tropical fish tend to be more colorful. However, the coldwater aquarium is also popular, which is mainly restricted to goldfish, but can include fish from temperate areas worldwide and native fish keeping.
Aquaria may be grouped by their species selection. The community tank is the most common today, where several non-aggressive species live peacefully. In these aquaria, the fish, invertebrates, and plants probably do not originate from the same geographic region, but tolerate similar water conditions. Aggressive tanks, in contrast, house a limited number of species that can be aggressive toward other fish, or are able to withstand aggression well. Most marine tanks and tanks housing cichlids have to take the aggressiveness of the desired species into account when stocking. Specimen tanks usually only house one fish species, along with plants, perhaps ones found in the fishes' natural environment and decorations simulating a natural ecosystem. This type is useful for fish that cannot coexist with other fish, such as the electric eel, as an extreme example. Some tanks of this sort are used simply to house adults for breeding.
Ecotype, ecotope, or biotope aquaria is another type based on species selection. In it, an aquarist attempts to simulate a specific natural ecosystem, assembling fish, invertebrate species, plants, decorations and water conditions all found in that ecosystem. These biotope aquaria are the most sophisticated hobby aquaria; public aquaria use this approach whenever possible. This approach best simulates the experience of observing in the wild. It typically serves as the healthiest possible artificial environment for the tank's occupants.
Public aquaria.
Most public aquarium facilities feature a number of smaller aquaria, as well those too large for home aquarists. The largest tanks hold millions of gallons of water and can house large species, including sharks or beluga whales. Dolphinaria are specifically for dolphins. Aquatic and semiaquatic animals, including otters and penguins, may also be kept by public aquaria. Public aquaria may also be included in larger establishments such as a marine mammal park or a marine park.
Virtual aquariums.
A virtual aquarium is a computer program which uses 3D graphics to reproduce an aquarium on a personal computer. The swimming fish are rendered in real time, while the background of the tank is usually static. Objects on the floor of the tank may be mapped in simple planes so that the fish may appear to swim both in front and behind them, but a relatively simple 3D map of the general shape of such objects may be used to allow the light and ripples on the surface of the water to cast realistic shadows. Bubbles and water noises are common for virtual aquariums, which are often used as screensavers.
The number of each type of fish can usually be selected, often including other animals like starfish, jellyfish, seahorses, and even sea turtles. Most companies that produce virtual aquarium software also offer other types of fish for sale via Internet download. Other objects found in an aquarium can also be added and rearranged on some software, like treasure chests and giant clams that open and close with air bubbles, or a bobbing diver. There are also usually features that allow the user to tap on the glass or put food in the top, both of which the fish will react to. Some also have the ability to allow the user to edit fish and other objects to create new varieties.

Pretenders discography

The discography of The Pretenders, a Hereford, England-based rock band, consists of nine studio albums, four compilation albums, one extended plays (EP), two live album, and 33 singles, though this does not include any solo material recorded by the individual members of The Pretenders.
Vocalist Chrissie Hynde, guitarist James Honeyman-Scott, and bassist Pete Farndon formed The Pretenders in 1978, soon signing to the independent label Sire Records and releasing their debut album "Pretenders". The Pretenders' second album, "Pretenders II", came out in 1981. The following year bassist Pete Farndon was fired because of his drug abuse and guitarist James Honeyman Scott died of a drug related heart attack two days later. Farndon died in 1983 of drug abuse. In 1984 the band released "Learning to Crawl". The band would later release two more albums before releasing the hit album "Last of the Independents".
In 1993, the Pretenders contributed a song "Bold as Love" to the album "".
"Viva el Amor", released in 1999, would be their first album to not chart in mainland Europe with the exception of Germany and Sweden, the album peaked at 158 on the "Billboard" 200. In 2002 they released "Loose Screw" peaking at 179 on the "Billboard" 200 and 55 on the UK Albums Chart. Break Up the Concrete was released in October 2008 and returned the Pretenders to the Top 40 on Billboard 200 when it peaked at 32. The album was not released in UK and Europe until June 2009 when it was released as a double album with a compilation album of hit songs, titled "The Best of / Break Up the Concrete". The double-album package peaked at 35 in the UK, returning them to the UK Top 40 for the first time since 2000's "Greatest Hits".

Permanence (novel)

Permanence is a 2002 science fiction novel by Karl Schroeder.
Plot.
The novel tells the story of two characters, Rue Cassels and Michael Bequith, and their encounter with an alien spacecraft Rue has named "Jentry's Envy." Schroeder uses the story as a venue for discussing the information economy and philosophy.
Rue, on the run from her brother Jentry and out of money, files claim on an undiscovered comet. She expects to profit from the mineral rights, but it turns out that the "comet" is actually an interstellar cycler, a ship that travels in a light-years length orbit, at relativistic speeds (85% c) carrying cargo and passengers between the Halo Worlds, planets that orbit Brown dwarf stars. The discovery causes a sensation, since the ship is the first to approach the planet Erythrion in ten years. Eventually her claim is upheld, since the cycler is silent, and her mineral rights become salvage rights, making her potentially very wealthy. A rich cousin of hers, Max Cassels, sponsors an expedition to the ship so she can claim it. Intrigue happens on the trip as several factions also want to claim it, such as the planetary government. The cyclers were the centerpiece of the Cycler Compact, but have slowly fallen out of use since the discovery of FTL travel, only possible between "lit" worlds. When they reach the ship, they are surprised to discover that it is an alien cycler, an unknown because all known aliens use FTL ships. They explore the ship some and jump off as it passes a lit world, Chandaka.
Michael Bequith, a NeoShinto monk and aide to Dr. Laurent Herat, an exobiologist are commandeered by Rear Admiral Crisler of the Rights Economy to join a joint expedition back to the "Envy". The RE is interested, because the "Envy" appears to be a multi-species vessel, something previously unheard of. They are also interested because writing on the craft is the script of an alien species, the Lasa, who have supposedly been extinct for the last two billion years. Rue and her crew are also returning, since under Compact law she can only complete her claim if she can control the "Envy".
Before they can leave, the city suffers a rebel attack and one of their party, Dr Linda Ophir, is murdered. They travel in a ramscoop ship, the "Banshee".
When they arrive, they explore various areas of the ship before an explosion damages life support on the "Banshee". Michael discovers that Dr. Ophir was murdered because she had discovered pictures of the writing on the "Envy" had been tampered with. Eventually they discover that part of the "Envy" is designed as a test to ascertain living conditions for visitors. Rue completes the process and the cycler builds them a new module and a set of controls. 
The expedition leaves the "Envy" for Oculus, a Halo world. Rue, now a Cycler Captain by law, is caught up in Compact politics over the course of the "Envy". Michael and Dr. Herat arrange with representative of the alien Autotrophs to translate the writing on the "Envy". The translation has grave consequences since it implies that the weapon of the Chicxulub, an ancient race that sent out waves of self-replicating machines to wipe out potential competitors, has survived. They realize that Crisler wants to use the weapon to wipe out the rebels. 
Rue learns from Max that Mallory, a Halo Worlder, wants to dissolve the Compact and join the RE. Rue goes to meet her crew gather to prepare to leave, but they are ambushed by Crisler and Max is killed. Rue, Michael, Dr Herat and Barents (a Rebel) escape in a submarine, but the attackers destroy the control computer just as they dive. They continue to do so for some hours, eventually getting caught by a cold current. They wind up at a secret undersea research base, where they are rescued by military police. 
They learn that Rue was believed dead along with her cousin and Crisler and Mallory have already departed for the "Envy", having learned its point of origin, Apophis and Osiris, planetless binary brown dwarfs. They expect that he will arrive in sixteen months. The government has a secret way that will get them there, but only for citizens of the Compact. 
Dr. Herat elects to become a citizen of the compact, but Michael abstains. Michael passes preparation time for the trip by exploring abandoned ice tunnels on the planet with Barents. They discover that the Autotroph plans to leave the planet and warn its race about the weapon. Michel convinces them to let humans handle it. A message from a loyal member of the "Envy'"s crew arrives, stating that Crisler is planning a dangerous maneuver that will cut three months off his travel time. Rue takes drastic measures and shanghais Michael on the voyage, a new technology that allows a fleet of 15 small interceptor ships to enter FTL from inside the atmosphere of a brown dwarf.
They arrive safely at the Twins (except for one ship) and discover that the Twins are ringed with power tethers that allow resources and power to be extracted. In the orbital center of the system is the construction shack that created the "Envy". Her fleet is briefly attacked by the systems defenses, but she learns how to camouflage her ships. The Banshee was less successful and suffered a major hull breach.
Rue and the soldiers sneak into the "Banshee" and free some of her original crew. The rest are in the construction shack, being used as explorers by Crisler. They leave for the construction shack, stealing an antimatter generator to use as cover. They enter the shack by way of burning a hole in the hull. Inside, Michael's team and Crisler's men are engaged in a firefight (literally, as the inside atmosphere is a hydrogen/oxygen mix). Michael shoots out a magnet block controlling the airlock and Crisler's marines are sucked out into space.
However, Chrisler soon recaptures them. He reveals that the shack is not the true treasure, but the cycler mother seeds, one of which can regrow a complete cycler construction system. He plans to reverse engineer the technology and use it to wipe out the rebels and their worlds. Since the ships would be unable to distinguish between Rebel and alien worlds, this would amount to genocide on a universal scale. They also discover that the shack was not built by Lasa, but renegade Chicxulub, who embraced the Lasa philosophy.
The Crysler's new cycler finishes and the shack launches it. Rue and company escape from Crisler by cutting loose a habitat. Barendts leaves with the seed and Michael pursues him. Rue leaves the habitat to get one of the interceptors and meets Michael, returning with the seed. 
Later, Rue and her crew watch as Crysler's cycler is launched from the system. The power tethers have redirected power back into one of the dwarfs to create a massive flare to use as an energy beam. 
On Erythrion, Rue announces her plan to revitalize the Cycler Compact, since the Lasa/Chicxulub technology means that the Halo worlds will at last be able to launch their own cyclers. 
Rue, however, is already planning her voyage to New Armstrong to reclaim the "Envy" and capture Crysler and Mallory.
Information economy.
In the "rights economy", all physical objects are nano-tagged so that payment may be enforced for all uses of proprietary information. The result is a libertarian dystopia. Schroeder assumes solutions to the problems of conducting trade in space conducted almost entirely through intangible goods—some form of interstellar money (Pp. 86, 321)—without explaining the underlying problem of creating such a currency or how the solution was devised.
Supreme Meme.
Schroeder recycles Friedrich Nietzsche's myth of the eternal return to critique all organized religion with a plot device he describes as the Supreme Meme. The philosophic question asked is whether or not the subject would choose to relive the same life over again "exactly as it was, no detail spared?" (pp. 232–233).
Interstellar Cycler.
In "Permanence," Schroeder envisions a vehicle that would never slow down, instead using Lorentz force turning to curve its trajectory in a circle, an idea considered by P.C. Norem in a 1969 paper. The idea is that the life support for an interstellar vehicle wouldn't have to be accelerated, only the payload, allowing more to be carried for a given energy budget.
Literary significance and reception.
Roberta Johnson in her review for "Booklist" said "by turns exciting and thoughtful, pitiless and romantic, Schroeder's excellent novel is the best kind of coming-of-age novel, one that seizes the imagination and the emotions." "Booklist" praised the novel saying "once again, the plot—of which the foregoing is barely a hint—arises organically from the backdrop and characters: thoughtful, well-informed, insightful work, with a sharp yet subtle political subcontext, catapulting Schroeder into SF's front rank." The "Library Journal" said "the author of Ventus showcases his gift for panoramic storytelling in this story of a young woman's struggle to find her place in a world where trust and friendship are rare treasures." Christine C. Menefee in her review for" School Library Journal" said "this suspenseful, complex tale asks many intriguing questions and illustrates more scientific principles than a semester of science labs. Some readers might not quite follow all of the rapid twists and turns, but they will want to hang on to reach the story's satisfying conclusion, where a thoughtful solution emerges amid plenty of fireworks."

<doc id="19230414" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19230414" title="Taraxacum">
Taraxacum

Taraxacum is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. They are native to Eurasia and North and South America, and two species, "T. officinale" and "T. erythrospermum", are found as weeds worldwide. Both species are edible in their entirety. The common name dandelion ( , from French "dent-de-lion", meaning "lion's tooth") is given to members of the genus, and like other members of the Asteraceae family, they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a head is called a floret. Many "Taraxacum" species produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant.
Description.
The species of "Taraxacum" are tap-rooted biennial or perennial herbaceous plants, native to temperate areas of the Old and New Worlds.
The leaves are 5–25 cm long or longer, simple and basal, entire or lobed, forming a rosette above the central taproot. The flower heads are yellow to orange coloured, and are open in the daytime but closed at night. The heads are borne singly on a hollow stem (scape) that rises 1–10 cm or more above the leaves and exudes a milky latex when broken. A rosette may produce several flowering stems at a time. The flower heads are 2–5 cm in diameter and consist entirely of ray florets. The flower heads mature into spherical seed heads called "blowballs" or "clocks" (in both British and American English) containing many single-seeded fruits called achenes. Each achene is attached to a pappus of fine hairs, which enable wind-aided dispersal over long distances.
The flower head is surrounded by bracts (sometimes mistakenly called sepals) in two series. The inner bracts are erect until the seeds mature, then flex downward to allow the seeds to disperse; the outer bracts are always reflexed downward. Some species drop the "parachute" from the achenes; the hair-like parachutes are called "pappus", and they are modified sepals. Between the pappus and the achene, there is a stalk called a beak, which elongates as the fruit matures. The beak breaks off from the achene quite easily, separating the seed from the parachute.
False dandelions.
Many similar plants in the Asteraceae family with yellow flowers are sometimes known as "false dandelions". Dandelions are very similar to catsears ("Hypochaeris"). Both plants carry similar flowers, which form into windborne seeds. However, dandelion flowers are borne singly on unbranched, hairless and leafless, hollow stems, while catsear flowering stems are branched, solid and carry bracts. Both plants have a basal rosette of leaves and a central taproot. However, the leaves of dandelions are smooth or glabrous, whereas those of catsears are coarsely hairy.
Other plants with superficially similar flowers include hawkweeds ("Hieracium") and hawksbeards ("Crepis"). These are readily distinguished by branched flowering stems, which are usually hairy and bear leaves.
Classification.
The genus is taxonomically complex, with some botanists dividing the group into about 34 macrospecies, and about 2000 microspecies; approximately 235 apomictic and polyploid microspecies have been recorded in Great Britain and Ireland. Some botanists take a much narrower view and only accept a total of about 60 species.
History.
Dandelions are thought to have evolved about thirty million years ago in Eurasia. They have been used by humans for food and as a herb for much of recorded history.
Names.
The Latin name "Taraxacum" originates in medieval Persian writings on pharmacy. The Persian scientist Al-Razi around 900 (A.D.) wrote "the tarashaquq is like chicory". The Persian scientist and philosopher Ibn Sīnā around 1000 (A.D.) wrote a book chapter on "Taraxacum". Gerard of Cremona, in translating Arabic to Latin around 1170, spelled it "tarasacon".
The English name, "dandelion", is a corruption of the French "dent de lion" meaning "lion's tooth", referring to the coarsely toothed leaves. The plant is also known as "blowball", "cankerwort", "doon-head-clock", "witch's gowan", "milk witch", "lion's-tooth", "yellow-gowan", "Irish daisy", "monks-head", "priest's-crown" and puff-ball; other common names include "faceclock", "pee-a-bed", "wet-a-bed",
"swine's snout", white endive, and wild endive.
The name "dandelion" is a cognate of the names in many other European languages, such as the Welsh "dant y llew", Italian "dente di leone", Catalan "dent de lleó", Spanish "diente de león", Portuguese "dente-de-leão", Norwegian "Løvetann", Danish "Løvetand" and German "Löwenzahn". The colloquial German word "Pusteblume" (blow-flower) refers to the children's game of blowing away the seeds of the ripe taraxacum flower.
In modern French, the plant is named "pissenlit" (or vernacular "pisse au lit"). Likewise, "piss-a-bed" is an English folk-name for this plant, as are "piscialletto" in Italian, "pixallits" in Catalan and "meacamas" in Spanish. These names refer to the strong diuretic effect of the plant's roots, either roasted or raw. In various north-eastern Italian dialects, the plant is known as "pisacan" ("dog pisses"), because they are found at the side of pavements.
In France, it is also known as "laitue de chien" (dog's lettuce), "salade de taupe" (mole's salad), "florin d'or" (golden florin); "cochet" (cockerel); "fausse chicorée" (false chicory); "couronne de moine" (monk's crown); "baraban".
In several European languages, the plant, or at least its parachute ball stage, is named after the popular children's pastime of blowing the parachutes off the stalk: "Pusteblume" German for "blowing flower"), "soffione" (Italian for "blowing", in some northern Italian dialects), "dmuchawiec" (Polish, derived from the verb "blow"), "одуванчик" (Russian, derived from the verb "blow").
In other languages, the plant is named after the white latex found in its stem, e.g., "mlecz" (derived from the Polish word for "milk"), "mælkebøtte" (Danish for "milk pot"), "kutyatej" (Hungarian for "dog milk"), "маслачак" (Serbian, from "маслац" meaning "butter"). The Lithuanian name "kiaulpienė" can be translated as "sow milk". Similarly, in Latvian it is called "pienene", derived from "piens" ('milk'), as in Catalan is used "lletsó" (derived from the word "llet" that means "milk").
The alternative Hungarian name "gyermekláncfű" ("child's chain grass") refers to the habit of children to pick dandelions, remove the flowers, and make links out of the stems by "plugging" the narrow top end of the stem into the wider bottom end.
In Bulgarian and Macedonian, its name (respectively "глухарче" and "глуварче") is derived from the word for 'deaf' ("глух", "глув"), because of a traditional belief that dandelion parachutes can cause deafness.
In Turkish, the dandelion is called "karahindiba" meaning "black endive or chicory". While the root flesh is white, the outer skin of the root is dark brown or black.
In Swedish, it is called "maskros" ('worm rose') after the small insects (thrips) usually present in the flowers.
In Finnish and Estonian, it is called "voikukka" and "võilill", respectively, meaning "butter flower", referring to its buttery colour. Similarly, in Croatian, the name of this plant ("maslačak") is derived from the noun "maslac", meaning "butter".
In Dutch, it is called "paardenbloem", meaning "horse-flower".
In Chinese, it is called "pú gōng yīng" (蒲公英), meaning "flower that grows in public spaces by the riverside".
In Persian, it is called "qasedak" (قاصدک), meaning the "small postman", because of a belief that it brings good news.
In Portuguese, it is called "dente-de-leão", also meaning "lion's tooth". Portuguese children also call them "o teu pai é careca" (your dad is bald) due to a game which consisted on blowing on a dandelion. If it was left with no seeds, that would mean the other kid's dad was bald.
In Greek, its seed (and most often the plant itself) is called a "kleftis" (κλέφτης) meaning "thief" because it is very difficult to catch once airborne.
In Cyprus, the plant is called a "pappous" (παππούς) meaning "grandfather" due to the white-coloured seed head resembling the white hair of an older man.
In Romanian it is generally called "păpădie".
In Albanian it is called "përkalidhe", "prakalidhe", as well as "luleshurdha" (meaning "deaf plant"), "radhiqe / luleradhiqe" ( from a misconception due to its resemblance to chicory leaf, see radicchio), as well as "lakra" or "lakra të egra" (translated as "wild "lakra""), a name which generalizes a family of similar green leaf vegetables including as well sorrel, chicory, catsear, scarole, and other local indigenous plants.
Properties.
Edibility.
Dandelions are found on all continents and have been gathered for food since prehistory, but the varieties cultivated for consumption are mainly native to Eurasia. A perennial plant, its leaves will grow back if the taproot is left intact. To make leaves more palatable, they are often blanched to remove bitterness. Dandelion leaves and buds have been a part of traditional Sephardic, Chinese, and Korean cuisine. In Crete, Greece, the leaves of a variety called Mari (Μαρί), Mariaki (Μαριάκι) or Koproradiko (Κοπροράδικο) are eaten by locals, either raw or boiled, in salads. "Taraxacum megalorhizon", a species endemic to Crete, is eaten in the same way; it is found only at high altitudes (1000 to 1600 m.) and in fallow sites, and is called pentaramia (πενταράμια) or agrioradiko (αγριοράδικο).
The flower petals, along with other ingredients, usually including citrus, are used to make dandelion wine. The ground, roasted roots can be used as a caffeine-free dandelion coffee. Dandelion was also traditionally used to make the traditional British soft drink dandelion and burdock, and is one of the ingredients of root beer. Also, dandelions were once delicacies eaten by the Victorian gentry, mostly in salads and sandwiches.
Dandelion leaves contain abundant vitamins and minerals, especially vitamins A, C and K, and are good sources of calcium, potassium, iron and manganese.
Medicinal uses.
Historically, dandelion was prized for a variety of medicinal properties, and it contains a wide number of pharmacologically active compounds. Dandelion is used as a herbal remedy in Europe, North America and China. It has been used in herbal medicine to treat infections, bile and liver problems, and as a diuretic.
Food for wildlife.
"Taraxacum" seeds are an important food source for certain birds.
Dandelions are also important plants for northern hemisphere bees, providing an important source of nectar and pollen early in the season. Dandelions are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). See List of Lepidoptera that feed on dandelions. They are also used as a source of nectar by the pearl-bordered fritillary ("Boloria euphrosyne"), one of the earliest emerging butterflies in the spring.
Benefits to gardeners.
The dandelion plant is a beneficial weed, with a wide range of uses, and is even a good companion plant for gardening. Its taproot will bring up nutrients for shallower-rooting plants, and add minerals and nitrogen to soil. It is also known to attract pollinating insects and release ethylene gas which helps fruit to ripen.
Cultural importance.
Four dandelion flowers are the emblem of White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. The citizens celebrate spring with an annual Dandelion Festival.
The dandelion is the official flower of the University of Rochester and "Dandelion Yellow" is one of the school's official colors. The Dandelion Yellow is an official University of Rochester song.
Dangers.
Dandelion pollen may cause allergic reactions when eaten, or adverse skin reactions in sensitive individuals. Contact dermatitis after handling has also been reported, probably from the latex in the stems and leaves. Due to its high potassium level, dandelion can also increase the risk of hyperkalemia when taken with potassium-sparing diuretics. The consumption of dandelion leaves has also been implicated in occurrences of fasciolosis.
As a noxious weed.
The species "Taraxacum officinale" is listed as a noxious weed in some jurisdictions, and is considered to be a nuisance in residential and recreational lawns in North America. It is also an important weed in agriculture and causes significant economic damage because of its infestation in many crops worldwide.
As source of natural rubber.
Dandelion milk had been known to contain latex for a long time. The latex exhibited the same quality as the natural rubber from rubber trees. Yet in the wild types of dandelion, the latex content is low and varies greatly. By inhibiting one key enzyme and using modern cultivation methods and optimization techniques, scientists in the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) in Germany developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber. In collaboration with Continental Tires, IME is building a pilot facility. The first prototype test tires made with blends from dandelion-rubber are scheduled to be tested on public roads over the next few years.

Organizações Globo () is the largest mass media group of Latin America, founded in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1925 by Irineu Marinho. It also owns companies on the food industry and the real estate and financial markets.
The first enterprise of the company was the newspaper "A Noite", founded by Irineu Marinho. With the success of the newspaper, published on the late afternoon, he decided to launch the morning daily O Globo in 1925. After the sudden death of his father, just weeks after the launch of "O Globo", Roberto Marinho became the director of the company. Working actively on the media business, Roberto decided to invest in other areas and launched Radio Globo on 1944. However, the company only became recognizable nationwide after the launching of Rede Globo, the second-largest commercial TV network in the world, in 1965.
Today the company is run by Roberto Irineu Marinho, João Roberto Marinho, and José Roberto Marinho. In May 2013, a study released by media agency ZenithOptimedia showed Globo occupied the 17th place in a list with the top global media owners. It was the first time the company appeared on this ranking.

XXIX Tactical Air Command

The XXIX Tactical Air Command (XXIX TAC) is an inactive United States Air Force unit. Its last assignment was with the Ninth Air Force, based at Weimar, Germany. It was inactivated on 25 October 1945.
During World War II, the mission of the command was to support the United States Ninth Army with tactical air support throughout its easterly advance from its formation on 5 September 1944, until VE-Day.
History.
The unit was formed in England during 1943 as XXIX Air Support Command (IX ASC). The primary mission of the command was to provide tactical close air support of the United States Ninth Army ground forces to interdict concentration of enemy forces, attack communications and ammunition dumps, and harass the enemy's retreat as well as providing reconnaissance to bombing support. 
It was re-designated as XXIX Tactical Air Command (XXIX TAC) in April 1944 in England, and its mission initially was attacking enemy forces in occupied France and the Low Countries in preparation for the Normandy invasion in June. Targets included bridges, roads, railroads and enemy interceptor aircraft both on the ground as well as in air-to-air combat. 
The unit was deployed to France in July 1944, and initially supported First and Third Army units while Ninth Army built up forces in England. When Ninth Army was moved into France in early September, the command provided tactical air support in the final reduction of the German forces holding out in the French port of Brest. After the surrender of the town fifteen days later, Ninth Army was sent east to take its place in the line. It came into the line in between Third and First Army.
In November, Ninth Army was shifted to the very left flank of 12th Army Group. It undertook operations to close the front up to the Roer River. December 16 saw the opening of the last great German offensive of the war, the Battle of the Bulge. During the fierce combat, it attacked enemy targets in the Northern Rheinland during the Rhineland Campaign and Operation Grenade, which was the southern prong of a pincer attack coordinated with Canadian First Army's Operation Veritable, with the purpose of closing the front up to the Rhine River. By 10 March, the Rhine had been reached in all sectors of Ninth Army's front. It was not until after 20 March that Ninth Army units first crossed the Rhine itself.
XXIX Tactical Air Command attacked ground targets in the Ruhr, providing air support as Allied ground forces encircled enemy forces in the Ruhr pocket, essentially ending organized enemy resistance in Western Germany. Ninth Army halted its advance at the Elbe River in late April 1945, the wing engaging targets of opportunity in enemy-controlled areas until combat was ended on 5 May 1945.
The unit remained in Europe after the war as part of United States Air Forces in Europe, performing occupation duty and the destruction or shipment to the United States of captured enemy combat equipment. It was demobilized in Germany and the organization was inactivated on 20 November 1945.

This reaction is a considerable subject area of research with implications for fuel cell design.
It main utility lies in the removal of carbon monoxide (CO) from the fuel cell's feed gas. CO poisons the catalyst of most low-temperature fuel cells.
Carbon monoxide is often produced as a by-product from steam reforming of hydrocarbons, which produces hydrogen and CO.
It is possible to consume most of the CO by reacting it with steam in the water-gas shift reaction:
The water-gas shift reaction can reduce CO to 1% of the feed, with the added benefit of producing more hydrogen, but not eliminate it completely.
To be used in a fuel cell, feed gas must have CO below 10 ppm.
Description.
The PROX process allows for the reaction of CO with oxygen, reducing CO concentration from approximately 0.5–1.5% in the feed gas to less than 10 ppm.
Due to the prevalent presence of hydrogen in the feed gas, the competing, undesired combustion of hydrogen will also occur to some degree:
The selectivity of the process is a measure of the quality of the reactor, and is defined as the ratio of consumed carbon monoxide to the total of consumed hydrogen and carbon monoxide.
The disadvantage of this technology is its very strong exothermic nature, coupled with a very narrow optimal operation temperature window, and is best operated between 353 and 450 kelvin, yielding a hydrogen loss of around one percent. Effective cooling is therefore required. In order to minimise steam generation, excessive dilution with nitrogen is used. Additionally the reaction is interrupted with an intermediary cooler before proceeding to a second stage.
In the first reaction an excess of oxygen is provided, at around a factor of two, and about 90% of the CO is transformed. In the second step a substantially higher oxygen excess is used, at approximately a factor of 4, which is then processed with the remaining CO, in order to reduce the CO concentration to less than 10 ppm. To also avoid excess CO-fraction loading, the transient operation of a CO adsorber may be important.
The instrumentation and process control complexity requirements are relatively high. The advantage of this technique over selective methanation is the higher space velocity, which reduces the required reactors size. For the case of strong temperature rises, the feed of air can simply be broken.
The technical origins for CO-PrOx lies in the synthesis of ammonia (Haber process). Ammonia synthesis also has a strict requirement of CO-free syngas, as CO is a strong catalyst poison for the usual catalysts used in this process.

Quetzalcoatl

Quetzalcoatl () is a Mesoamerican deity whose name comes from the Nahuatl language and means "feathered serpent". The worship of a feathered serpent deity is first documented in Teotihuacan in the first century BCE or first century CE. That period lies within the Late Preclassic to Early Classic period (400 BCE – 600 CE) of Mesoamerican chronology, and veneration of the figure appears to have spread throughout Mesoamerica by the Late Classic (600–900 AD).
In the Postclassic period (900–1519 AD), the worship of the feathered serpent deity was based in the primary Mexican religious center of Cholula. It is in this period that the deity is known to have been named "Quetzalcoatl" by his Nahua followers. In the Maya area he was approximately equivalent to Kukulcan and Gukumatz, names that also roughly translate as "feathered serpent" in different Mayan languages.
In the era following the 16th-century Spanish Conquest, a number of sources were written that conflate Quetzalcoatl with Ce Acatl Topiltzin, a ruler of the mythico-historic city of Tollan. It is a matter of much debate among historians to which degree, or whether at all, these narratives about this legendary Toltec ruler describe historical events. Furthermore, early Spanish sources written by clerics tend to identify the god-ruler Quetzalcoatl of these narratives with either Hernán Cortés or St. Thomas—an identification which is also a source of diversity of opinions about the nature of Quetzalcoatl.
Among the Aztecs, whose beliefs are the best-documented in the historical sources, Quetzalcoatl was related to gods of the wind, of Venus, of the dawn, of merchants and of arts, crafts and knowledge. He was also the patron god of the Aztec priesthood, of learning and knowledge. Quetzalcoatl was one of several important gods in the Aztec pantheon, along with the gods Tlaloc, Tezcatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli.
Feathered Serpent deity in Mesoamerica.
A feathered serpent deity has been worshiped by many different ethno-political groups in Mesoamerican history. The existence of such worship can be seen through studies of iconography of different Mesoamerican cultures, in which serpent motifs are frequent. On the basis of the different symbolic systems used in portrayals of the feathered serpent deity in different cultures and periods, scholars have interpreted the religious and symbolic meaning of the feathered serpent deity in Mesoamerican cultures.
Iconographic depictions.
The earliest iconographic depiction of the deity is believed to be found on Stela 19 at the Olmec site of La Venta, depicting a serpent rising up behind a person probably engaged in a shamanic ritual. This depiction is believed to have been made around 900 BC. Although probably not exactly a depiction of the same feathered serpent deity worshipped in classic and post-classic periods, it shows the continuity of symbolism of feathered snakes in Mesoamerica from the formative period and on, for example in comparison to the Mayan Vision Serpent shown below.
The first culture to use the symbol of a feathered serpent as an important religious and political symbol was Teotihuacan. At temples such as the aptly named "Quetzalcoatl temple" in the Ciudadela complex, feathered serpents figure prominently and alternate with a different kind of serpent head. The earliest depictions of the feathered serpent deity were fully zoomorphic, depicting the serpent as an actual snake, but already among the Classic Maya the deity began acquiring human features.
In the iconography of the classic period Maya serpent imagery is also prevalent: a snake is often seen as the embodiment of the sky itself, and a vision serpent is a shamanic helper presenting Maya kings with visions of the underworld.
The archaeological record shows that after the fall of Teotihuacan that marked the beginning of the epi-classic period in Mesoamerican chronology around 600 AD, the cult of the feathered serpent spread to the new religious and political centers in central Mexico, centers such as Xochicalco, Cacaxtla and Cholula. Feathered serpent iconography is prominent at all of these sites. Cholula is known to have remained the most important center of worship to Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec/Nahua version of the feathered serpent deity, in the post-classic period.
During the epi-classic period, a dramatic spread of feathered serpent iconography is evidenced throughout Mesoamerica, and during this period begins to figure prominently at cites such as Chichén Itzá, El Tajín, and throughout the Maya area. Colonial documentary sources from the Maya area frequently speak of the arrival of foreigners from the central Mexican plateau, often led by a man whose name translates as "Feathered Serpent"; it has been suggested that these stories recall the spread of the feathered serpent cult in the epi-classic and early post-classic periods.
In the post-classic Nahua civilization of central Mexico (Aztec), the worship of Quetzalcoatl was ubiquitous. The most important center was Cholula where the world's largest pyramid was dedicated to his worship. In Aztec culture, depictions of Quetzalcoatl were fully anthropomorphic. Quetzalcoatl was associated with the windgod Ehecatl and is often depicted with his insignia: a beak-like mask.
Interpretations.
On the basis of the Teotihuacan iconographical depictions of the feathered serpent, archaeologist Karl Taube has argued that the feathered serpent was a symbol of fertility and internal political structures contrasting with the War Serpent symbolizing the outwards military expansion of the Teotihuacan empire. Historian Enrique Florescano also analysing Teotihuacan iconography shows that the Feathered Serpent was part of a triad of agricultural deities: the Goddess of the Cave symbolizing motherhood, reproduction and life, Tlaloc, god of rain, lightning and thunder and the feathered serpent, god of vegetational renewal. The feathered serpent was furthermore connected to the planet Venus because of this planet's importance as a sign of the beginning of the rainy season. To both Teotihuacan and Mayan cultures, Venus was in turn also symbolically connected with warfare.
While not usually feathered, classic Maya serpent iconography seems related to the belief in a sky-, Venus-, creator-, war- and fertility-related serpent deity. In the example from Yaxchilan, the Vision Serpent has the human face of the young maize god, further suggesting a connection to fertility and vegetational renewal; the Mayan Young Maize god was also connected to Venus.
In Xochicalco, depictions of the feathered serpent are accompanied by the image of a seated, armed ruler and the hieroglyph for the day sign 9 Wind. The date 9 Wind is known to be associated with fertility, Venus and war among the Maya and frequently occurs in relation to Quetzalcoatl in other Mesoamerican cultures.
On the basis of the iconography of the feathered serpent deity at sites such as Teotihuacan, Xochicalco, Chichén Itzá, Tula and Tenochtitlan combined with certain ethnohistorical sources, historian David Carrasco has argued that the preeminent function of the feathered serpent deity throughout Mesoamerican history was as the patron deity of the Urban center, a god of culture and civilization.
In Aztec culture.
To the Aztecs, Quetzalcoatl was, as his name indicates, a feathered serpent, a flying reptile (much like a dragon), who was a boundary-maker (and transgressor) between earth and sky. He was a creator deity having contributed essentially to the creation of Mankind. He also had anthropomorphic forms, for example in his aspects as Ehecatl the wind god. Among the Aztecs, the name Quetzalcoatl was also a priestly title, as the two most important priests of the Aztec Templo Mayor were called "Quetzalcoatl Tlamacazqui". In the Aztec ritual calendar, different deities were associated with the cycle-of-year names: Quetzalcoatl was tied to the year Ce Acatl (One Reed), which correlates to the year 1519.
Myths.
Attributes.
The exact significance and attributes of Quetzalcoatl varied somewhat between civilizations and through history. There are several stories about the birth of Quetzalcoatl. In a version of the myth, Quetzalcoatl was born by a virgin named Chimalman, to whom the god Onteol appeared in a dream. In another story, the virgin Chimalman conceived Quetzalcoatl swallowing an emerald. A third story narrates that Chimalman was hit in the womb by an arrow bolted by Mixcoatl and nine months later she gave birth to a child which was called Quetzalcoatl. A fourth story narrates that Quetzalcoatl was born from Coatlicue, who already had four hundred children who formed the stars of the Milky Way.
According to another version of the myth, Quetzalcoatl is one of the four sons of Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl, the four Tezcatlipocas, each of whom presides over one of the four cardinal directions. Over the West presides the White Tezcatlipoca, Quetzalcoatl, the god of light, justice, mercy and wind. Over the South presides the Blue Tezcatlipoca, Huitzilopochtli, the god of war. Over the East presides the Red Tezcatlipoca, Xipe Totec, the god of gold, farming and Spring time. And over the North presides the Black Tezcatlipoca, known by no other name than Tezcatlipoca, the god of judgment, night, deceit, sorcery and the Earth. Quetzalcoatl was often considered the god of the morning star, and his twin brother Xolotl was the evening star (Venus). As the morning star, he was known by the title "Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli", meaning "lord of the star of the dawn." He was known as the inventor of books and the calendar, the giver of maize (corn) to mankind, and sometimes as a symbol of death and resurrection. Quetzalcoatl was also the patron of the priests and the title of the twin Aztec high priests. Some legends describe him as opposed to human sacrifice while others describe him practicing it.
Most Mesoamerican beliefs included cycles of suns. Usually our current time was considered the fifth sun, the previous four having been destroyed by flood, fire and the like. Quetzalcoatl went to Mictlan, the underworld, and created fifth-world mankind from the bones of the previous races (with the help of Cihuacoatl), using his own blood, from a wound he inflicted on his earlobes, calves, tongue, and penis, to imbue the bones with new life.
It is also suggested that he was a son of Xochiquetzal and Mixcoatl.
One Aztec story claims that Quetzalcoatl was tricked by Tezcatlipoca into becoming drunk and sleeping with a celibate priestess (in some accounts, his sister Quetzalpetlatl) and then burned himself to death out of remorse. His heart became the morning star (see Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli).
Belief in Cortés as Quetzalcoatl.
Since the sixteenth century, it has been widely held that the Aztec Emperor Montezuma II initially believed the landing of Hernán Cortés in 1519 to be Quetzalcoatl's return. This view has been questioned by ethno-historians who argue that the Quetzalcoatl-Cortés connection is not found in any document that was created independently of post-Conquest Spanish influence, and that there is little proof of a pre-Hispanic belief in Quetzalcoatl's return. Most documents expounding this theory are of entirely Spanish origin, such as Cortés's letters to Charles V of Spain, in which Cortés goes to great pains to present the naïve gullibility of the Aztecs in general as a great aid in his conquest of Mexico.
Much of the idea of Cortés' being seen as a deity can be traced back to the Florentine Codex written down some 50 years after the conquest. In the Codex's description of the first meeting between Moctezuma and Cortés, the Aztec ruler is described as giving a prepared speech in classical oratorial Nahuatl, a speech which, as described in the codex written by the Franciscan Bernardino de Sahagún and his Tlatelolcan informants, included such prostrate declarations of divine or near-divine admiration as,
"You have graciously come on earth, you have graciously approached your water, your high place of Mexico, you have come down to your mat, your throne, which I have briefly kept for you, I who used to keep it for you,"
"You have graciously arrived, you have known pain, you have known weariness, now come on earth, take your rest, enter into your palace, rest your limbs; may our lords come on earth."
Subtleties in, and an imperfect scholarly understanding of, high Nahuatl rhetorical style make the exact intent of these comments tricky to ascertain, but Restall argues that Moctezuma's politely offering his throne to Cortés (if indeed he did ever give the speech as reported) may well have been meant as the exact opposite of what it was taken to mean: politeness in Aztec culture was a way to assert dominance and show superiority. This speech, which has been widely referred to, has been a factor in the widespread belief that Moctezuma was addressing Cortés as the returning god Quetzalcoatl.
Other parties have also promulgated the idea that the Mesoamericans believed the conquistadors, and in particular Cortés, to be awaited gods: most notably the historians of the Franciscan order such as Fray Gerónimo de Mendieta. Some Franciscans at this time held millennarian beliefs and some of them believed that Cortés' coming to the New World ushered in the final era of evangelization before the coming of the millennium. Franciscans such as Toribio de Benavente "Motolinia" saw elements of Christianity in the precolumbian religions and therefore believed that Mesoamerica had been evangelized before, possibly by St. Thomas whom legend had it had "gone to preach beyond the Ganges". Franciscans then equated the original Quetzalcoatl with St. Thomas and imagined that the Indians had long awaited his return to take part once again in God's kingdom. Historian Matthew Restall concludes that:
"The legend of the returning lords, originated during the Spanish-Mexica war in Cortés' reworking of Moctezuma's welcome speech, had by the 1550's merged with the Cortés-as-Quetzalcoatl legend that the Franciscans had started spreading in the 1530's." (Restall 2001:114 )
Some scholarship still maintains the view that the Aztec Empire's fall may be attributed in part to the belief in Cortés as the returning Quetzalcoatl, notably in works by David Carrasco (1982) and H. B. Nicholson (2001 (1957)). However, a majority of modern Mesoamericanist scholars such as Matthew Restall (2003), James Lockhart (1994), Susan D. Gillespie (1989), Camilla Townsend (2003a, 2003b), Louise Burkhart, Michel Graulich and Michael E. Smith (2001) among others, consider the "Quetzalcoatl/Cortés myth" as one of many myths about the Spanish conquest which have risen in the early post-conquest period.
Modern-day interpretations.
Mormonism.
Some Mormons believe that Quetzalcoatl was actually Jesus Christ. According to the Book of Mormon, Jesus visited the American continent after his resurrection. Quetzalcoatl is not a religious symbol in the Mormon faith, and is not taught as such, nor is it in their doctrine. LDS Church President John Taylor wrote:
"The story of the life of the Mexican divinity, Quetzalcoatl, closely resembles that of the Savior; so closely, indeed, that we can come to no other conclusion than that Quetzalcoatl and Christ are the same being. But the history of the former has been handed down to us through an impure Lamanitish source, which has sadly disfigured and perverted the original incidents and teachings of the Savior's life and ministry." (Mediation and Atonement, p. 194.)"
Latter-day Saint scholar Brant Gardner, after investigating the link between Quetzalcoatl and Jesus, concluded that the association amounts to nothing more than folklore. In a 1986 paper for "Sunstone", he noted that during the Spanish Conquest, the Native Americans and the Catholic priests who sympathized with them felt pressure to link Native American beliefs with Christianity, thus making the Native Americans seem more human and less savage. Over time, Quetzalcoatl's appearance, clothing, malevolent nature, and status among the gods were reshaped to fit a more Christian framework.
New Age.
Various theories about Quetzalcoatl are popular in the New Age movement, especially since the publication of Tony Shearer's 1971 book "Lord of the dawn: Quetzalcoatl and the Tree of Life" republished also under the title "Lord of the dawn: Quetzalcoatl, the plumed serpent of Mexico."

Brown Mountain (Klamath County, Oregon)

Brown Mountain is a small cinder cone on top of a shield volcano located in Cascade Volcanic Arc in Klamath and Jackson counties, Oregon. Most of the mountain, including its peak, is in western Klamath County, but its western flanks trail off into eastern Jackson County. It is above sea level, but is overshadowed by nearby Mount McLoughlin.
Geology.
Brown Mountain appears to be relatively young at first as its summit is unweathered and devoid of trees, however glacial valleys and a cirque near the summit prove that the mountain is actually twelve thousand to sixty thousand years old. Around two thousand years ago,
a large lava flow consisting primarily of basaltic andesite covered of the north and western slopes with Aa-type lava over thick.
Over its lifetime, the mountain has erupted over of lava.
Access and trails.
Brown Mountain can be accessed via Oregon Route 140, which passes just north of the peak. It can also be accessed through the Pacific Crest Trail, and the Brown Mountain Trail.
Flora and fauna.
The area at the base of the mountain is covered with old growth forests. The mountain is also home to animals such as Douglas squirrels and pikas. Toward the summit, the land is nearly devoid of vegetation.

Xanthogaleruca luteola

Xanthogaleruca luteola, commonly known as the elm-leaf beetle, is a beetle belonging to the family Chrysomelidae.
Description.
The imago is 6–8 mm in length, ranges from yellow to green in colour, with a spot on its head, an hourglass mark and two spots on the pronotum, and a broad, dark stripe along the edge of each elytron. The larvae are usually black, occasionally black and yellow, with multiple rows of dots on the back and on the sides and < 13 mm long. The pupae are orange-yellow with black chaetae. The ova are yellow, and laid in spindle-like clusters of < 25 on the undersides of the elm leaves.
Distribution.
These beetles are common in the Western Palaearctic ecozone from Portugal to Central Asia. 
Indigenous to Europe, it was accidentally introduced to North America and Australia.
Ecology.
"Xanthogaleruca luteola" is a serious pest of the elm. Both the imagines and larvae feed on the emergent leaves of the elm. Repeated heavy infestation rarely kills the tree outright, rather it usually weakens it, rendering it vulnerable to disease. However, the beetle does not transmit Dutch elm disease.
The imagines depart their hibernation sites (often houses) in early spring, the females laying their ova on the underside of the elm leaves. The ova hatch after one week, the larvae immediately feeding on the undersides of the leaves. This larval stage lasts for a period of between two and three weeks, at the end of which it will migrate to the lower part of the tree in search of bark crevices in which to pupate. The next generation emerges in mid-summer after two to three weeks' pupation, and begins feeding on the leaves. The female can lay < 800 ova, but this ovipositing may be interrupted by shortening of the photoperiod to < 14 hours, inducing a brief feeding bout before the search for a hibernation site.
Hosts include English Elm ("Ulmus procera"), Scotch Elm ("Ulmus glabra"), American Elm ("Ulmus americana"), Siberian Elm ("Ulmus pumila"), Chinese Elm ("Ulmus parvifolia") as well as complex hybrids such as 'Homestead'. The beetle has also been reported on "Zelkova serrata".
Symptoms.
The larval feeding pattern leaves the upper surface and veins of the leaf intact, but causes it to wither and fall. The feeding imagines create small irregular but discrete holes in the leaves, and are generally less destructive than their offspring.
Controls.
In North America, there are few natural enemies, but in Europe, the ova of the beetle are often heavily predated by the chalcidoid wasp "Oomyzus gallerucae".
Insecticide sprays are of little use since by the time the infestation is apparent, the application will be too late to be effective. However, tree trunks banded with insecticides can limit repetition the following year by killing the larvae as they descend before hibernation. "Soil injection" presents an non-invasive alternative to trunk injections with a 2 year effect on the "X. luteola" population.
Nearly all chemicals currently used commercially in Australia to treat Elm Leaf Beetle, regardless of brand name or delivery method, are neonicotinoid insecticides. This is the chemical type that has just had a two year ban placed on it by the European Commission. The ban is due to the association between the widespread use of these chemicals and its impact on bee populations.

Cronus

In the most classic and well known version of Greek mythology, Cronus or Kronos ( ) was the leader and the youngest of the first generation of Titans, divine descendants of Gaia, the earth, and Uranus, the sky. He overthrew his father and ruled during the mythological Golden Age, until he was overthrown by his own son Zeus and imprisoned in Tartarus.
Cronus was usually depicted with the harpe, a sickle which was the instrument he used to castrate and depose Uranus, his father. In Athens, on the twelfth day of the Attic month of Hekatombaion, a festival called Kronia was held in honour of Cronus to celebrate the harvest, suggesting that, as a result of his association with the virtuous Golden Age, Cronus continued to preside as a patron of harvest. Cronus was also identified in classical antiquity with the Roman deity Saturn.
Greek mythology and early myths.
In ancient myth recorded by Hesiod's "Theogony", Cronus envied the power of his father, the ruler of the universe, Uranus. Uranus drew the enmity of Cronus' mother, Gaia, when he hid the gigantic youngest children of Gaia, the hundred-handed Hecatonchires and one-eyed Cyclopes, in the Tartarus, so that they would not see the light. Gaia created a great stone sickle and gathered together Cronus and his brothers to persuade them to castrate Uranus.
Only Cronus was willing to do the deed, so Gaia gave him the sickle and placed him in ambush. When Uranus met with Gaia, Cronus attacked him with the sickle, castrating him and casting his testicles into the sea. From the blood that spilled out from Uranus and fell upon the earth, the Gigantes, Erinyes, and Meliae were produced. The testicles produced a white foam from which the goddess Aphrodite emerged. For this, Uranus threatened vengeance and called his sons "Titenes" (Τιτῆνες; according to Hesiod meaning "straining ones," the source of the word "titan", but this etymology is disputed) for overstepping their boundaries and daring to commit such an act. 
In an alternate version of this myth, a more benevolent Cronus overthrew the wicked serpentine Titan Ophion. In doing so, he released the world from bondage and for a time ruled it justly.
After dispatching Uranus, Cronus re-imprisoned the Hecatonchires, the Gigantes, and the Cyclopes and set the dragon Campe to guard them. He and his sister Rhea took the throne of the world as king and queen. The period in which Cronus ruled was called the Golden Age, as the people of the time had no need for laws or rules; everyone did the right thing, and immorality was absent.
Cronus learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be overcome by his own sons, just as he had overthrown his father. As a result, although he sired the gods Demeter, Hestia, Hera, Hades and Poseidon by Rhea, he devoured them all as soon as they were born, to prevent the prophecy. When the sixth child, Zeus, was born Rhea sought Gaia to devise a plan to save them and to eventually get retribution on Cronus for his acts against his father and children. Another child Cronus is reputed to have fathered is Chiron, by Philyra.
Rhea secretly gave birth to Zeus in Crete, and handed Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, also known as the Omphalos Stone, which he promptly swallowed, thinking that it was his son.
Rhea kept Zeus hidden in a cave on Mount Ida, Crete. According to some versions of the story, he was then raised by a goat named Amalthea, while a company of Kouretes, armored male dancers, shouted and clapped their hands to make enough noise to mask the baby's cries from Cronus. Other versions of the myth have Zeus raised by the nymph Adamanthea, who hid Zeus by dangling him by a rope from a tree so that he was suspended between the earth, the sea, and the sky, all of which were ruled by his father, Cronus. Still other versions of the tale say that Zeus was raised by his grandmother, Gaia.
Once he had grown up, Zeus used an emetic given to him by Gaia to force Cronus to disgorge the contents of his stomach in reverse order: first the stone, which was set down at Pytho under the glens of Mount Parnassus to be a sign to mortal men, and then his two brothers and three sisters. In other versions of the tale, Metis gave Cronus an emetic to force him to disgorge the children, or Zeus cut Cronus' stomach open. After freeing his siblings, Zeus released the Gigantes, the Hecatonchires, and the Cyclopes who forged for him his thunderbolts, Poseidon's trident and Hades' helmet of darkness. 
In a vast war called the Titanomachy, Zeus and his brothers and sisters, with the help of the Gigantes, Hecatonchires, and Cyclopes, overthrew Cronus and the other Titans. Afterwards, many of the Titans were confined in Tartarus, however, Atlas, Epimetheus, Menoetius, Oceanus and Prometheus were not imprisoned following the Titanomachy. Gaia bore the monster Typhon to claim revenge for the imprisoned Titans.
Accounts of the fate of Cronus after the Titanomachy differ. In Homeric and other texts he is imprisoned with the other Titans in Tartarus. In Orphic poems, he is imprisoned for eternity in the cave of Nyx. Pindar describes his release from Tartarus, where he is made King of Elysium by Zeus. In another version, the Titans released the Cyclopes from Tartarus, and Cronus was awarded the kingship among them, beginning a Golden Age. In Virgil's "Aeneid", it is Latium to which Saturn (Cronus) escapes and ascends as king and lawgiver, following his defeat by his son Jupiter (Zeus).
One other account referred by Robert Graves (who claims to be following the account of the Byzantine mythographer Tzetzes) it is said that Cronus was castrated by his son Zeus just like he had done with his father Uranus before. However the subject of a son castrating his own father, or simply castration in general, was so repudiated by the Greek mythographers of that time that they suppressed it from their accounts until the Christian era (when Tzetzes wrote).
Libyan account by Diodorus Siculus.
In a Libyan account related by Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), Cronus or Saturn, son of Uranus and Titea, is said to have reigned over Italy, Sicily, and Northern Africa. He cites as evidence the heights in Sicily that were in his time known as "Cronia". Cronus, joined by the Titans, makes war against and eventually defeats his brother Jupiter, who reigns in Crete, and his brother-in-law Hammon, who reigns at Nysa, an island on the river Triton, somewhere in Africa. 
Cronus takes his sister Rhea from Hammon, to be his own wife. Cronus in turn is defeated by Hammon's son Bacchus or Dionysus, who appoints Cronus' and Rhea's son, Jupiter Olympus, as governor over Egypt. Bacchus and Jupiter Olympus then join their forces to defeat the remaining Titans in Crete, and on the death of Bacchus, Jupiter Olympus inherits all the kingdoms, becoming lord of the world. (Diodorus, "Book III")
Sibylline Oracles.
Cronus is again mentioned in the "Sibylline Oracles", particularly book three, which makes Cronus, 'Titan' and Iapetus, the three sons of Uranus and Gaia, each to receive a third division of the Earth, and Cronus is made king over all. After the death of Uranus, Titan's sons attempt to destroy Cronus' and Rhea's male offspring as soon as they are born, but at Dodona, Rhea secretly bears her sons Zeus, Poseidon and Hades and sends them to Phrygia to be raised in the care of three Cretans. Upon learning this, sixty of Titan's men then imprison Cronus and Rhea, causing the sons of Cronus to declare and fight the first of all wars against them. This account mentions nothing about Cronus either killing his father or attempting to kill any of his children.
Name and comparative mythology.
H. J. Rose in 1928 observed that attempts to give "Kronos" a Greek etymology had failed.
Recently, Janda (2010) offers a genuinely Indo-European etymology of "the cutter", from the root "*(s)ker-" "to cut" (Greek κείρω (keirō), c.f. English "shear"), motivated by Cronus' characteristic act of "cutting the sky" (or the genitals of anthropomorphic Uranus).
The Indo-Iranian reflex of the root is "kar", generally meaning "to make, create" (whence "karma"), but Janda argues that the original meaning "to cut" in a cosmogonic sense is still preserved in some verses of the Rigveda pertaining to Indra's heroic "cutting", like that of Cronus resulting in creation:
RV 10.104.10 "" "he hit Vrtra fatally, cutting [> creating] a free path"
RV 6.47.4 "" "he cut [> created] the loftiness of the sky."
This may point to an older Indo-European mytheme reconstructed as "" "by means of a cut he created the loftiness of the sky".
The myth of Cronus castrating Uranus parallels the "Song of Kumarbi", where Anu (the heavens) is castrated by Kumarbi. In the "Song of Ullikummi", Teshub uses the "sickle with which heaven and earth had once been separated" to defeat the monster Ullikummi, establishing that the "castration" of the heavens by means of a sickle was part of a creation myth, in origin a cut creating an opening or gap between heaven (imagined as a dome of stone) and earth enabling the beginning of time ("Chronos") and human history.
During antiquity, Cronus was occasionally interpreted as "Chronos", the personification of time;
according to Plutarch the Greeks believed that Cronus was an allegorical name for Chronos. In addition to the name, the story of Cronus eating his children was also interpreted as an allegory to a specific aspect of time held within Cronus' sphere of influence. As the theory went, Cronus represented the destructive ravages of time which consumed all things, a concept that was definitely illustrated when the Titan king devoured the Olympian gods - the past consuming the future, the older generation suppressing the next generation. During the Renaissance, the identification of Cronus and Chronos gave rise to "Father Time" wielding the harvesting scythe.
A theory debated in the 19th century, and sometimes still offered somewhat apologetically, holds that "Kronos" is related to "horned", assuming a Semitic derivation from "qrn".
Andrew Lang's objection, that Cronus was never represented horned in Hellenic art, was addressed by Robert Brown, arguing that in Semitic usage, as in the Hebrew Bible "qeren" was a signifier of "power". When Greek writers encountered the Levantine deity El, they rendered his name as "Kronos".
Robert Graves proposed that "cronos" meant "crow", related to the Ancient Greek word "corōnē" (κορώνη) "crow", noting that Cronus was depicted with a crow, as were the deities Apollo, Asclepius, Saturn and Bran.
El, the Phoenician Cronus.
When Hellenes encountered Phoenicians and, later, Hebrews, they identified the Semitic El, by "interpretatio graeca", with Cronus. The association was recorded c. AD 100 by Philo of Byblos' Phoenician history, as reported in Eusebius' "Præparatio Evangelica" I.10.16. Philo's account, ascribed by Eusebius to the semi-legendary pre-Trojan War Phoenician historian Sanchuniathon, indicates that Cronus was originally a Canaanite ruler who founded Byblos and was subsequently deified. This version gives his alternate name as "Elus" or "Ilus", and states that in the 32nd year of his reign, he emasculated, slew and deified his father Epigeius or Autochthon "whom they afterwards called Uranus". It further states that after ships were invented, Cronus, visiting the 'inhabitable world', bequeathed Attica to his own daughter Athena, and Egypt to Taautus the son of Misor and inventor of writing.
Roman mythology and later culture.
While the Greeks considered Cronus a cruel and tempestuous force of chaos and disorder, believing the Olympian gods had brought an era of peace and order by seizing power from the crude and malicious Titans, the Romans took a more positive and innocuous view of the deity, by conflating their indigenous deity Saturn with Cronus. Consequently, while the Greeks considered Cronus merely an intermediary stage between Uranus and Zeus, he was a larger aspect of Roman religion. The Saturnalia was a festival dedicated in his honour, and at least one temple to Saturn already existed in the archaic Roman Kingdom.
His association with the "Saturnian" Golden Age eventually caused him to become the god of "time", i.e., calendars, seasons, and harvests—not now confused with Chronos, the unrelated embodiment of time in general; nevertheless, among Hellenistic scholars in Alexandria and during the Renaissance, Cronus was conflated with the name of "Chronos", the personification of "Father Time", wielding the harvesting scythe.
As a result of Cronus' importance to the Romans, his Roman variant, Saturn, has had a large influence on Western culture. The seventh day of the Judaeo-Christian week is called in Latin "Dies Saturni" ("Day of Saturn"), which in turn was adapted and became the source of the English word "Saturday". In astronomy, the planet Saturn is named after the Roman deity. It is the outermost of the Classical planets (those that are visible with the naked eye).
