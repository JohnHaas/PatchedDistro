USS Nero (AC-17)

USS "Nero" (AC–17), a steel steam collier, was built in 1895 as steamer "Whitgift" by J.L. Thompson and Sons, Sunderland, England; purchased on 30 June 1898 from McCondray and Co. at San Francisco; and commissioned on 8 June 1898, Commander Charles Belknap in command.
Service.
Spanish-American War.
Acquired by the United States Navy for service as a collier and supply ship, "Nero" was part of the first mobile Fleet Train, organized to meet logistic demands created by far-flung U.S. Naval Operations in the Spanish–American War. Following conversion at Mare Island Navy Yard, the ship departed San Francisco on 23 June 1898 for the Philippines, in company with the monitor . Sailing by way of Honolulu and Guam, the collier arrived Manila on 14 August and remained there supporting U.S. forces occupying the Philippines until departing on 4 October on a coaling voyage, steaming to Taku, China and Nagasaki, Japan, before returning to Cavite on 20 November.
"Nero" sailed for home on 1 December and arrived Mare Island on 7 January 1899, where she was placed out of commission.
"Nero" recommissioned on 10 April and sailed five days later for the Hawaiian Islands for deep sea soundings, then steamed via Guam to the Philippines arriving Cavite on 4 August. There she coaled various naval vessels until sailing on 9 September for Yokohama to continue deep sea sounding. The collier got under way for the west coast on 24 September, stopping at Guam and Honolulu and arriving Mare Island on 15 February 1900. During this voyage she took a sounding in the area of the Challenger Deep, recording a depth of 5269 fathoms (9,636 m, 31,614 ft), the greatest depth recorded at that time. She decommissioned on 20 May.
Placed in service on 4 October, "Nero" departed on 23 October from Mare Island on her third voyage to the Far East. Steaming to Yokohama by way of Honolulu from 23 October-27 November, she then proceeded to Cavite on 12 December to supply American forces putting down the Philippine insurrection. On 9 February 1901, the collier sailed for the United States, taking the long way home by way of Ceylon, Suez, Algiers, Malta, and Gibraltar, and docking at Norfolk on 16 April. The ship departed Norfolk on 11 June on a long coaling voyage down the east coast of South America, returning on 12 December. Two months later, she sailed again for Latin America, this time going around Cape Horn to supply the Pacific outpost of Tutuila, Samoa. Returning to the States on 29 July, "Nero" underwent overhaul at New York and then sailed on 12 October for a return voyage to the Philippines. Once again steaming through the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal and the Indian Ocean, the well-traveled collier arrived at Cavite on 21 December where she remained for one month, giving needed logistic support, and then returned the way she had come, putting into Boston on 28 April 1903.
"Nero" sailed on 25 July for the Pacific. Rounding Cape Horn once again, the collier made intermittent stops along the coast of South America and arrived San Francisco on 22 February 1904. She remained in the Pacific making one voyage to Honolulu and then Kiska in the Aleutians from 14 April-22 August, then departed Mare Island to return around Cape Horn to Norfolk, arriving on 2 March 1905.
World War I.
Serving as an Atlantic Fleet auxiliary for the next six years, the collier cruised the east coast from Boston to Rio de Janeiro, decommissioning twice for brief periods of upkeep — first from 23 June 1906-1 February 1907 and then again from 3 January 1910-16 September 1911 — and coaling many ships of the Atlantic Fleet and South American Patrol Force in her valuable service to the Fleet. On 21 October, the collier departed Norfolk to return to the Pacific. Steaming once more around Cape Horn, she arrived San Diego on 29 January 1912 and the next month began supply operations off Mexico. Following a voyage to the North Pacific from 20 May-23 November, visiting various ports in Alaska and the Aleutians, "Nero" continued cruising the eastern Pacific, making two brief trips to Pearl Harbor from 5 February-6 March 1913 and 31 March-8 May, until decommissioning on 31 July 1913 at Puget Sound Navy Yard.
"Nero" was once again placed in full service on 29 April 1914 and 3 days later resumed her logistic operations, cruising from Bremerton to La Paz. Assigned to the Pacific Fleet on 5 June 1915, the collier continued her operations on into 1917. On 19 July, she departed San Francisco for New York, to meet the demand for auxiliaries in the Atlantic due to the increasing scope of U.S. naval operations in World War I. Passing through the Panama Canal on 2 August, "Nero" arrived Norfolk on the 18th. She sailed for Europe via the Azores on 11 September and shortly after her arrival at Queenstown, Ireland on 13 October, was assigned to duty with the newly formed Naval Overseas Transportation Service.
Based at Cardiff, Wales, "Nero" began operations with the Army's Cross Channel Service, transporting coal from English ports to France until 25 February 1919, subject to German submarine attacks and the hazardous English Channel weather. She then sailed for Norfolk, arriving on 17 March. After unloading, the collier proceeded to New York on 22 April, and then cruised the east coast for the next month, carrying cargo to New England and Middle Atlantic ports until arriving Charlestown on 22 May for extensive overhaul. There she remained for over a year, undergoing complete repair and alteration. On 14 August 1920, she sailed to Hampton Roads to load cargo and then steamed to the Caribbean to coal U.S. naval vessels at Guantanamo Bay and Santo Domingo, returning to Norfolk on 28 September.
"Nero" departed Norfolk for the last time on 5 December 1920 to return to the Pacific and her homeport of San Francisco. Proceeding by way of the Panama Canal, the veteran collier arrived Mare Island on 7 February 1921. She departed on her last voyage the next day, steaming first to Pearl Harbor and then to Tutuila and returning by way of Pearl Harbor to San Francisco on 6 June. "Nero" decommissioned on 12 September and was sold to A. Bercovich and Co. of Oakland, California on 29 July 1922.

Auchenoglanis

Auchenoglanis is a genus of claroteid catfishes native to Africa.
"Auchenoglanis" is a primitive member of the subfamily Auchenoglanidinae and represents a stem group. 
Species of this genus occur predominantly in the Nilo-Sudan region, but also in the Congo River, Lakes Mobutu and Tanganyika.
"Auchenoglanis" species mainly feed on insect aquatic larvae and eventually on small mollusks, alevin, and swimming insects. These feeding habits should also enable them to stand a relatively wide range of ecological conditions.
Species.
There are currently three recognized species in this family:
Fossil record.
"Auchenoglanis" is rare in the fossil record compared to other African catfishes. "Auchenoglanis" includes an extinct species, "Auchenoglanis soye" from Western Chad. A few other fossils are also attributed to "Auchenoglanis" with no specific species described.

<doc id="19401931" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19401931" title="Chippewa Marching Band">
Chippewa Marching Band

The Chippewa Marching Band (also called the Marching Chips) is Central Michigan University's marching band.
Motto.
The motto of the Marching Chippewas is ""Semper Superne Nitens - Concordia Ad Astra"", which means "Always striving upward - Together to the stars".
History.
The band was one of the nation's first college marching bands to embrace the drum corps style that has since become the common practice of high school and university bands. And emphasis on musicianship, quality music arrangements, and visually coordinated field designs were all part of this initiative. In the 1960s, the band received some nationwide television coverage with their performances at Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions football games. Then, in 1974, the band traveled with the football team for the Division II national championship game (The Camiellia Bowl) and received significant airtime for their halftime performance. That same year, the band was featured in the nationwide release of recordings of new marching band music from Charter Publications (which was sent to all high school and college band directors in the nation).
Jack Saunders served as assistant director from 1963–78, and as director of the Marching Chips from 1979-99. He was the master of drill design and field maneuvers, which he handled with great skill and accuracy. Saunders also was responsible for directing one of the concert bands, the jazz lab band, and teaching French horn.
Instrumentation.
Unlike many college marching bands, the Chippewa Marching Band does not have a set number of members. Membership fluctuates from year to year, but generally stays between 200 and 300 members. The 2013 Chippewa Marching Band has 285 members.[http://www.mus.cmich.edu/about_the_school/ensembles/chippewa_marching_band/] The instrumentation also is typical of other university marching bands.
Organization.
Director.
The director of the Chippewa Marching Band since 2000 is Dr. James Batcheller, Associate Director of Bands and CMU Alumnus. Batcheller was drum major of the Chippewa Marching Band as an undergraduate. After receiving a Master of Music degree from Florida State University and a Doctor of Musical Arts degree from the University of Oklahoma, Batcheller taught in Great Falls, Montana, and the University of Oklahoma before returning to Central in 2000. As well as directing the Marching Chips, Batcheller also conducts the CMU Wind Symphony, teaches the Introduction to Conducting and Instrumental Organization courses, and is the faculty advisor for the Lambda Tau chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi and for the Nu Pi chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia.
Instructors, faculty, and staff.
The Marching Chips also enjoy the musical assistance of Prof. John Williamson, director of university bands at CMU since 1979. Williamson is only the second person to hold is position in the last 63 years (the other having been Prof. Norman Dietz, who served in that role from 1949–79)
Facilities.
Jack Saunders Marching Band Field.
The marching rehearsal field is named in honor of the band's director/assistant director/former drum major who retired in 2000 after a 38 year career at Central Michigan.
Norman C. Dietz Band Rehearsal Hall.
The rehearsal hall is named in honor of the band's leader, "The Chief" from 1946-79.
Kelly/Shorts Stadium.
Kelly/Shorts Stadium seats 30,199 fans, and was built in 1973. It was renovated and expanded in 1999.

Robert Joseph Champoux (born December 2, 1942), is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender. He made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut with the Detroit Red Wings on March 29, 1964 when he replaced an injured Terry Sawchuk in a 5–4 victory at Chicago Stadium that evened the semifinal series against the Blackhawks at one game apiece. After Sawchuk returned to play all the remaining matches in the Red Wings' Stanley Cup playoff run, Champoux did not play in another NHL contest until nine years later when he registered a 2–11–3 record with the California Golden Seals, the worst team in the league during the 1973–74 season. He spent the remainder of his professional hockey career in the minor leagues.

Château de Syam

The Château de Syam, located in the village of Syam in the French department of Jura was built in 1818 by Emmanuel Jobez regional industrialist and owner of the Forges de Syam, a forge and sheet metal works. 
The castle is listed as a "Monument historique" since 1991 by the French Ministry of Culture.
Inspiration.
Emmanuel Jobez lived in Paris for ten years where he met Pierre-Adrien Pâris, court architect to Louis XVI and also a native of Jura. Both men embraced Neoclassical architecture and together toured Italy where they visited works designed by Andrea Palladio. They returned impressed by classical architecture and its association with Enlightenment philosophy.
Design.
Emmanuel Jobez returned to Syam where he engaged the architect Champennois L'Aîne to build a château largely inspired by Palladio's Villa La Rotonda. Completed c. 1828, the square building is situated on a north-south, east-west axis and organized around a central three-story rotunda. The ground floor of the rotunda is used as a theater and concert hall. Decoration of the house includes polychrome painting, trompe-l'oeil murals in the eye of the dome, original wallpapers produced by Xavier Mader for the manufacturer Joseph Dufour et Cie, candelabra and chandeliers by Pierre-Philippe Thomire, and original Empire and Restauration period furniture. The château remained in ownership of Jobez descendants until 2001 when the property was acquired by Brigitte Cannard and Claude Darbon who occupy a portion of the house and offer tours and concerts there.

Michael Chapman (lawyer)

Michael Chapman is an American lawyer, and former senior officer in the United States Army's Judge Advocate General corps, who was appointed the legal adviser to the Office of Military Commissions, in Guantanamo on September 19, 2008.
According to the official press release that announced his appointment his previous appointments included being:
William J. Kreutzer Jr..
Chapman sat on the appeal of William J. Kreutzer Jr.'s murder conviction while serving on the Army Court of Criminal Appeals.
Sergeant Kreutzer had been convicted of opening fire on his comrades at Fort Bragg, killing one, and injuring seventeen.
Two of the officers who have presided over Omar Khadr's Guantanamo Military Commissions, Peter Brownback and Patrick Parrish, presided over Sergeant Kreutzer's Court Martial.
Service for the Office of Military Commissions, in Guantanamo.
The Office of Military Commissions manages the Guantanamo military commissions, appointing the officers who judge, prosecute and defend the captives who are charged, as well as authorizing the final approval of those charges. The Office is headed by a civilian official called the "Appointing Authority", currently Susan J. Crawford.
The Appointing Authority's deputy is called the Advisor to the appointing authority.
In April 2005 Chapman was appointed deputy legal advisor, number three in the hierarchy.
Temporary suspension.
In July 2007 a new legal advisor was appointed, Brigadier General Thomas W. Hartmann.
Hartmann and former Chief Prosecutor Colonel Morris Davis had an acrimonious relationship.
Davis had publicly aired his concerns that Hartmann had become too involved in managing the prosecution, including picking which captives should be prosecuted.
Davis felt picking the captives to be charged was his job, and pointed out that Hartmann's role required him to be impartial, because he was also supposed to advise the Appointing Authority about the functioning of the Defense team.
While DoD authorities were conducting their inquiry into Morris's concerns Crawford directed that both Hartmann, and Chapman, his deputy, were temporarily removed from their responsibilities. A more junior official Ron White, was to take on the responsibilities of both men.
Appointment as Legal Advisor.
When Chapman's was appointed to replace his superior, Thomas W. Hartmann, Hartmann was transferred to the position of director of operations, planning and development for the military commissions.
According to the "Washington Post" Morris Davis was critical of Hartmann and Chapman's new appointments, and noted:

Letov Š-19

__NOTOC__
The Letov Š-19 was an airliner produced in small numbers in Czechoslovakia during the 1920s. Following tests with a Š-6 bomber over domestic passenger routes, ČSA requested that a passenger-carrying version be developed. While retaining the basic layout of the Š-6, the Š-19 added a fully enclosed passenger cabin within the fuselage, with seating for four. The pilot had an open cockpit to the rear of this.
Three machines were built with the same Maybach engine that had powered the bomber version, but these were found to have poor flying characteristics, and for the other four examples produced, a Walter powerplant was used instead, along with making some refinements to the ailerons and wing bracing.
Put into service on the Prague-Košice route, the type was not a success. The passenger cabin was very noisy, since it was placed immediately behind the engine. Furthermore, this placement made boarding and disembarking very awkward, and visibility for the passengers was poor. Besides all this, the Š-19 could not match the performance offered by foreign aircraft, and no further production was undertaken.

Chinese Labour Corps

The Chinese Labour Corps (CLC) was a force of workers recruited by the British government in World War I to free troops for front line duty by performing support work and manual labour. In all, some 140,000 men served in the CLC before it was disbanded and most of the men repatriated to China between 1918 and 1920.
Origins.
In 1916, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig requested that 21,000 labourers be recruited to fill the manpower shortage caused by casualties during World War I. As China was initially not a belligerent nation, her nationals were not allowed by their government to participate in the fighting - although the Chinese later declared war against Germany and Austria–Hungary, on 14 August 1917.
The scheme to recruit Chinese to serve as non-military personnel was pioneered by the French government. A contract to supply 50,000 labourers was agreed upon on 14 May 1916 and the first contingent left Tianjin for Dagu and Marseille in July 1916. The British government also signed an agreement with the Chinese authorities to supply labourers. The recruiting was launched by the War Committee in London in 1916 to form a Labour Corps of labourers from China to serve in France and to be known as the Chinese Labour Corps. A former railway engineer, Thomas J. Bourne, who had worked in China for 28 years, arrived at Weihaiwei (then a British colony) on 31 October 1916 with instructions to establish and run a recruiting base.
The Chinese Labour Corps comprised Chinese men who mostly came from Shandong Province, and to a lesser extent from Liaoning, Jilin, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui and Gansu Provinces. The first transport ship carrying 1,088 labourers sailed from the main depot at Weihaiwei on 18 January 1917. The journey to France took 3 months. Most travelled to Europe (and later returned to China) via the Pacific and by Canada.
Service.
[[File:IWM-Q 9011.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese performers entertain Labour Corps members and British troops at an open-air theatre
at Étaples, June 1918]]
A total of about 140,000 Chinese workers served on the Western Front during and after the War. Among them, 100,000 served in the British Chinese Labour Corps. About 40,000 served with the French forces, and hundreds of Chinese students served as translators.
By the end of 1917 there were 54,000 Chinese labourers with the Commonwealth forces in France and Belgium. In March the Admiralty declared itself no longer able to supply the ships for transport and the British government were obliged to bring recruitment to an end. The men already serving in France completed their contracts. By the time of the Armistice, the Chinese Labour Corps numbered
nearly 96,000, while 30,000 were working for the French. In May 1919, 80,000 Chinese Labour Corps were still at work.
The workers mainly aged between 20 and 35 served as labour in the rear echelons or helped build munitions depots. They were tasked with carrying out essential work to support the frontline troops, such as unloading ships, building dugouts, repairing roads and railways, digging trenches and filling sandbags. Some worked in armaments factories, others in naval shipyards, for a pittance of one to three francs a day. At the time they were seen just as cheap labour, not even allowed out of camp to fraternise locally, dismissed as mere coolies. When the war ended some were used for mine clearance, or to recover the bodies of soldiers and fill in miles of trenches. Their contribution went forgotten for decades until military ceremonies resumed in 2002 at the Chinese cemetery of Noyelles-sur-Mer.
After the Armistice, the Chinese, each identified only by an impersonal reference number, were shipped home. Only about 5,000 to 7,000 stayed in France, forming the nucleus of the later Chinese community in Paris. Most who survived returned to China in 1918. 
Throughout the war, trade union pressure prevented the introduction of Chinese labourers to the British Isles. Sidney and Beatrice Webb suggested that the Chinese Labour Corps were restricted to carrying out menial unskilled labour due to pressure from British trade unions. However, some members of the Corps carried out skilled and semi–skilled work for the Tank Corps, including riveting and engine repair.
One member of the Corps, First Class Ganger Liu Dien Chen, was recommended for the Military Medal for rallying his men while under shellfire in March 1918. However he was eventually awarded Meritorious Service Medal as it was decided Labour Corps members were not eligible for the Military Medal. By the end of the war, the Meritorious Service Medal had been awarded to five Chinese workers.
After the war, the British government sent a War Medal to every member of the CLC. The medal was like British War Medal issued to every member of the British armed forces, except that it was of bronze, not silver.
Other workers.
As well as Chinese workers, there were Labour Corps serving in France from Egypt, Fiji, India, Malta, Mauritius, Seychelles, the British West Indies as well as a Native Labour Corps from South Africa. It was estimated that at the end of the war over 300,000 workers from the Colonies had aided in labour. There were 100,000 Egyptians, 21,000 Indians and 20,000 South Africans working throughout France and the Middle East by the end of the war in 1918.
Aftermath.
After the end of the war Chinese labourers were given transport back to China between December 1918 and September 1920.
Casualties.
The Corps did not take part in combat. According to the records kept by the British and French recruiters, around 2,000 men of the Chinese Labour Corps died during World War I, most from the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu pandemic, and some as a direct result of enemy action or of wounds received in the course of their duties. In all, an estimated ten thousand died in the war effort, victims of shelling, landmines, poor treatment or the worldwide Spanish flu epidemic of 1918. Some Chinese scholars, who contest these figures, say the number of deaths was as high as 20,000.
Fifteen members of the corps were sentenced to death for murder during the course of the war. In addition, four died and nine were wounded when British troops fired on them in December 1917.
The members of the CLC who died were classified as war casualties and were buried in about 40 French and Belgian graveyards in the North of France, with a total of about 2000 tombs and a few tombs in one cemetery in Belgium. The largest number of graves are at Noyelles-sur-Mer on the Somme, next to the workers' camp of the British army where a cholera outbreak and some of the fiercest battles occurred as well. The cemetery contains 842 gravestones each engraved with Chinese characters, guarded by two stone lions, gifts from China. 
One of the four following proverbs were inscribed on the standard Commonwealth War Grave Portland stone gravestones: "Faithful unto death", "A good reputation endures forever", "A noble duty bravely done" and "Though dead he still liveth". 
Cemeteries include:
Impact.
The workers saw first-hand that life in Europe was far from ideal, and reported this on their return to China after the war. Chinese intellectuals of the New Culture Movement looked on the CLC as a point of pride - Chen Duxiu, for instance, bragged that "while the sun does not set on the British Empire, neither does it set on Chinese workers abroad." But the ill treatment of these workers was added to the list of grievances against Britain. A more positive impact was on the educated youth who came to France to work with them, such as James Yen, whose literacy programmes under the auspices of the YMCA showed him the worth and dignity of the Chinese common man. He worked out a 1,000 Character Primer which introduced basic literacy and became the basis of his work in China.

Theresa Elmendorf

Theresa West Elmendorf was a prominent American librarian of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century.
Early life.
Elmendorf was born in 1855 in Pardeeville, Wisconsin, and raised in Milwaukee after the family moved there in 1861. She had three siblings. After attending Milwaukee public schools, she went to a higher education school for girls (Miss Wheelock's Seminary), graduating in 1874.
Career.
Elmendorf began her library career in 1877 working for the Young Men's Association of Milwaukee. To develop a basic knowledge of library theory and practice, she read the 1876 report of the U.S. Bureau of Education, "Public Libraries in the United States of America." About 1878 she started working at the Milwaukee Public Library, working her way up to deputy librarian in 1880 and finally head librarian in 1892.
In 1896, at age 41, Elmendorf resigned her position to marry Henry Livingston Elmendorf. He was librarian of the public library in St. Joseph, Missouri, and vice-president of the American Library Association. Henry Elmendorf soon took a position in Buffalo, New York, as the librarian of the Buffalo Public Library, where he worked until his death nine years later.
During these nine years Theresa Elmendorf acted as his silent partner and was an administrative advisor. She worked on many library programs, including the Buffalo Plan, a program to help the city schools with library services, and the "Descriptive Catalogue of the Gluck Collection of Manuscripts and Autographs in the Buffalo Public Library." Most notable in this collection was Mark Twain's "Huckleberry Finn" manuscript. She was also editor in 1904 for the American Library Association's "Catalogue of Books for Small Libraries" and an author of "Classroom Libraries for Public Schools".
Elmendorf became president of the New York Library Association in 1903 and 1904. When her husband died in 1906, the board of trustees of the Buffalo Public Library made Elmendorf vice-librarian, a position she held for the next 20 years. In 1911 she was elected president of the American Library Association, the first woman ever to be nominated for this position. She was in this position from May 24, 1911, to July 2, 1912.
Later life and death.
Elmendorf retired in 1926. After this she wrote, edited and published many bibliographies and reading lists, including some specifically on poets and poetry. She worked on these until her death in 1932. In 1951 "Library Journal" selected Elmendorf for its Library Hall of Fame.
Mary E. Hazeltine of the University of Wisconsin Library System wrote of Elmendorf, "Many librarians in important positions today have carried on because she awakened their appreciation of books and opened up for them insight into new realms. She was a stimulating guide and a vitalizing teacher, as well as a great librarian."

Joshua Tetley

Joshua Tetley (20 July 1778 – 26 August 1859) was the founder of the Tetley's Brewery in Leeds, England. The brewery was founded in 1822 and Joshua Tetley bought the brewery for £400. In 1839, Tetley made his son a partner of the business. It is a common misconception that the former Tetley's huntsman logo was a depiction of Tetley.
Early life and dynasty.
Tetley was born into a middle-class family of maltsters from the West Yorkshire village of Birkenshaw. His grandfather, William Tetley had formed a successful maltster's business in Armley, (a village close to Leeds). The business became a success and William, became wine and beer merchants in Leeds city centre. Joshua Tetley was the third of four brothers, Isaac, William and James. His elder brother William died aged two.
The family business under Tetley's father.
The Tetley business expanded under Tetley's father until 1801 when Tetley's business became bankrupt. When the bankruptcy was filed Tetley's had customers in Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cheshire and Surrey. By 1803, Tetley's father was back in business, as a Leeds based agent for the Imperial Fire Insurance Office of London, an agency which kept running until 1857.
Joshua enters the business.
Aged 29, Tetley married Hannah Carbutt on 12 March 1808 at Sheffield Parish Church. Carbutt was from an affluent family which included former Mayors of York and Leeds. They settled in a house on Park Square in Leeds. In 1822, aged 44, Tetley leased William Sykes' Brewery in Salem Place, Hunslet. Unusually for the time, Tetley head hunted staff, looking only for the most skilled brewers and maltsters from as far away as Manchester. Once the brewery was established it became the second largest in Leeds and had an estimated value of £22, while Robert Arthington's brewery held an estimated value of £100. Following the passing of the Beer House Act of 1830, Tetley's business grew and his recently acquired ale houses opened between 4 am and 10 pm. The temperance movement approved beer as a temperate alternative to spirits, which lead to the growth of many small breweries. When Tetley's father William Tetley died in 1834, Joshua received (according to William's 1820 will) £450 worth of his assets, much of which was invested in the Tetley business.
Death.
Tetley's wife Hannah died on 13 May 1857 (aged 72) and was buried in Hampsthwaite. Two years later on 26 August 1859, Tetley died and was buried with his wife.

The Ballad of East and West

The Ballad of East and West is a poem by Rudyard Kipling. It was first published in 1889, and has been much collected and anthologised since. Its first line is often quoted, sometimes as an example of Kipling's attitudes to race and to the Empire; but those who quote it thus often completely miss the third and fourth lines. It is worth quoting the refrain which opens, and closes, the poem in full:
This may be read as saying that 'it is indisputable that geographic points of the compass will never meet in this life, but that when two strong men ["or" equals] meet, the accidents of birth, whether of nationality, race, or family, do not matter at all - the Asian and the European are equals'.
Critical analysis.
The poem, which demonstrates Kipling's mastery of verse, is written in the style of a border ballad. It is printed as rhyming heptameters, two of which are equivalent to a ballad stanza; some texts print these in quatrains (groups of four lines). The vocabulary, stock phrases and rhythms are reminiscent of the old ballads, and the culture described is not unlike that of the Border Reivers: the first line of the actual story, for example, is "Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Border-side" to mean that a raid is in progress to cause trouble in the Border (here the North West Frontier, and originally the English/Scottish Border); the second line contains 'lifted', a Scots term for 'stolen', and the fourth 'calkin' (a technical term of horseshoes, here used to describe a trick of horse-mounted brigands, reversing the horseshoes to leave misleading tracks); and the second quatrain (line 9) has the stock phrase, also found in "Sir Patrick Spens" (), "Then up and spoke the son that led a of the Guides", with a most traditional driving rhythm. Such echoes are to be heard throughout the poem: there is a couplet that is repeated with slight variations several times:
Plot summary.
The story of the ballad is simple, to do with theft, honour and strength - like many of the border ballads. Kamal, a chieftain of the lawless North west Frontier, raids into British territory, and in the course of his raid, steals 'the Colonel's mare'. The Colonel's son, an officer in the Guides, follows him on "a raw rough dun" (poor quality horse) until he sees the white of the mare's eye. He fires, twice - and misses.
So the chase continues, until the dun stumbles and falls, whereupon Kamal turns back, and, after knocking the pistol out of the Colonel's son's hand, reveals that they have all along been covered by his men, hiding behind the rocks and thorn. The Colonel's son speaks defiantly of the vengeance that will be exacted should he be killed:
This earns Kamal's respect, whereon the Briton tells Kamal to
The ballad ends with the mare, who has nuzzled the British chest, returning to the Colonel; Kamal accepting the son's pistols, and sending his only son to be a trooper in the Guides. This is enough for the British officer to order an end to all the blood-feuds within the native troops:

Reliable multicast

A reliable multicast protocol is a computer networking protocol that provides a reliable sequence of packets to multiple recipients simultaneously, making it suitable for applications like multi-receiver file transfer or streaming media.
Overview.
Multicast is a network addressing method for the delivery of information to a group of destinations simultaneously using the most efficient strategy to deliver the messages over each link of the network only once, creating copies only when the links to the multiple destinations split (typically network switches and routers). However, like the User Datagram Protocol, multicast does not guarantee the delivery of a message stream. Messages may be dropped, delivered multiple times, or delivered out of order. A reliable multicast protocol adds the ability for receivers to detect lost and/or out-of-order messages and take corrective action (similar in principle to TCP), resulting in a gap-free, in-order message stream.
Reliability.
The exact meaning of "reliability" depends on the specific protocol instance. A minimal definition of reliable multicast is "eventual delivery of all the data to all the group members, without enforcing any particular delivery order".
However, not all reliable multicast protocols ensure this level of reliability; many of them trade efficiency for reliability, in different ways. For example, while TCP makes the sender responsible for transmission reliability, multicast NAK-based protocols shift the responsibility to receivers: the sender never knows for sure that all the receivers have in fact received all the data.
RFC 2887 explores the design space for bulk data transfer, with a brief discussion on the various issues and some hints at the possible different meanings of "reliable".

Grigorovich TB-5

Grigorovich TB-5 () was an experimental heavy bomber designed and tested in the Soviet Union in the early 1930s. Designed as a competitor for TB-3, TB-5 was intended to be powered by two FED 24-cylinder X engines of 746 kW (1,000 hp) each. When these were canceled, the underwing pods were revised to each house a pair of Bristol Jupiter engines in a push-pull configuration. Despite projected performance inferior to TB-3, it was hoped that TB-5 would gain an advantage by using less metal (in short supply at the time) thanks to its mixed construction of fabric-covered metal frame.
Test flights began on 1 May 1931 with disappointing results, in part due to poor thrust of the rear-facing engines. The prototype TB-5 was wrecked in a crash landing following the in-flight detachment of an engine in Spring 1932, and with the entry into service of the superior TB-3 that year, the TB-5 project was abandoned.

Internal discourse

An inner discourse, or internal discourse, is a constructive act of the human mind and a tool for discovering new knowledge and making decisions. Along with feelings such as joy, anger, fear, etc., and sensory awareness, it is one of the few aspects of the processing of information and other mental activities of which humans can be directly aware. Inner discourse is so prominent in the human awareness of mental functioning that it may often seem to be synonymous with "mind." The view is then that "mind" means "what one experiences when thinking things out," and that "thinking things out" is believed to consist only of the words heard in internal discourse. This common sense idea of the mind must either block out the fact that the mind is constantly processing all kinds of information below the level of awareness, or else rename that activity to some putatively "non-mental" status such as "reflex reaction" or even, sometimes, "demon possession." 
An inner discourse takes place much as would a discussion with a second person. One might think, "I need $27 for the paper boy. I have some paper currency in my wallet. Ten plus ten plus five... I have $25. Damn. Maybe I dropped coins in the sofa. Ah, here they are..." The ideal form of inner discourse would seem to be one that starts with statements about matters of fact and proceeds with logical rigor until a solution is achieved.
On this view of thinking, progress toward better thinking is made when one learns how to evaluate how well "statements of fact" are actually grounded, and when one learns how to avoid logical errors. But one must also take account of questions like why one is seeking a solution (Why do I want to contribute money to this charity?), and why one may keep getting results that turn out to be biased in fairly consistent patterns (Why do I never give to charities that benefit a certain group?).

Axel Graatkjær

Axel Graatkjær (1885–1969) was a Danish cinematographer noted for his work on silent films during the Golden Age of Danish cinema. Graatkjær was the favorite cinematographer of film director August Blom as well as silent film star Asta Nielsen and her husband, director Urban Gad. He filmed more than 100 films during his career from 1906 to 1930.
Career.
Axel Graatkjær was born Axel Sørensen on January 19, 1885 in Århus, Denmark. During his late teens, Graatkjær moved to Copenhagen for an education in music. In order to pay for his music studies, he worked as a ticket and program seller at the Biograf movie theater where he developed an interest in film making. In 1906, Graatkjær shot his first film—a short piece of news footage. That same year, Ole Olsen established the Nordisk Film studio and hired Graatkjaer as his cameraman. His first film was Viggo Larsen's the short "The Anarchist's Mother-in Law" ("Anarkistens Svigermoder"). In 1908 they made the "The Lion Hunt" ("Løvejagten", 1908). The short film created a scandal in Denmark because it showed the actual shooting of two lions that Olsen had purchased for the film. Graatkjær, who also acted the part of a hunter, was jailed for one day for participating in the film because it had been forbidden by the Ministry of State. The film was smuggled out of Denmark and became an international sensation. 
In 1910, he formally changed his name from Sørensen to Graatkjær. During the seven years working at the Nordisk Film company, Graatkjaer filmed more than 100 movies. He became the favorite cinematographer for the director August Blom, with whom he made popular melodramas such as "The White Slavery Trade" ("Den hvide slavehandel", 1910), "At the Prison Gates" ("Ved Fængslets Port", 1911) and "A Victim of the Mormons" ("Mormonens offer", 1911). In 1913, after a disagreement, Graatkjær left Nordisk Film to work for Asta Nielsen's German film company and her husband, director Urban Gad. They made 11 films together.
Graatkjær died on November 16, 1969.

<doc id="19402331" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19402331" title="Fuel hedging">
Fuel hedging

Fuel Hedging is a contractual tool some large fuel consuming companies, such as airlines, use to reduce their exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs. A fuel hedge contract allows a large fuel consuming company to establish a fixed or capped cost, via a commodity swap or option. Large fuel consuming companies enter into hedging contracts to mitigate their exposure to future fuel prices that may be higher than current prices and/or to establish a known fuel cost for budgeting purposes. If a large fuel consuming company buys a fuel swap and the price of fuel declines, the company will effectively be forced to pay an above-market rate for fuel. If a large fuel consuming company buys a fuel call option and the price of fuel increases, the company will receive a return on the option that offsets their actual cost of fuel. If a large fuel consuming company buys a fuel call option, which requires an upfront premium cost, much like insurance, and the price of fuel decreases, the company will not receive a return on the option but they will benefit from buying fuel at the then lower cost.
Background.
The cost of fuel hedging depends on the predicted future price of fuel. Airlines may place hedges either based on future prices of jet fuel or on future prices of crude oil. Because crude oil is the source of jet fuel, the prices of crude oil and jet fuel are normally correlated. However, other factors, such as difficulties regarding refinery capacity, may cause unusual divergence in the trends of crude oil and jet fuel.
A company that does not hedge its fuel costs generally believes one, if not both, of the following:
1. The company has the ability to pass on any and all increases in fuel prices to their customers, without a negative impact on their profit margins.
2. The company is confident that fuel prices are going to fall and is comfortable paying a higher price for fuel if, in fact, their analysis proves to be incorrect.
Typically, airlines will hedge only a certain portion of their fuel requirements for a certain period. Often, contracts for portions of an airline's jet fuel needs will overlap, with different levels of hedging expiring over time. 
During the 2009-2010 period, the studies for the airline industry have shown the average hedging ratio to be 64%. Especially during the peak stress periods, the ratio tends to increase.
Southwest Airlines has tended to hedge a greater portion of its fuel needs than other major U.S. domestic carriers. Southwest's aggressive fuel hedging has helped the airline avoid some of the pain of the recent airline industry downturn resulting from high fuel costs. Between 1999 and 2008, Southwest saved approximately $3.5 billion through fuel hedging.

Foster E. Mohrhardt

Foster Edward Mohrhardt (March 7, 1907-1992) was a United States librarian. He had a long and illustrious career in library and information science as a scholar, organizer and diplomat, and was listed by "American Libraries" among "100 Leaders we had in the 20th Century".
Birth and education.
Mohrhardt was born in Lansing, Michigan, on March 7, 1907, to Albert Mohrhardt and Alice (Bennet) Mohrhardt. He earned his A.B. degree from Michigan State University in 1929 while working as an assistant to the University Librarian. He then earned a B.S. Degree in 1930 from Columbia University and subsequently received a diploma from the University of Munich in 1932. He completed his M.A. in 1933 at the University of Michigan and was enrolled in the Ph.d program at Columbia University in 1934–35.
Early career.
After completing his formal education, Mohrhardt worked with William Bishop on an advisory group on junior college libraries for the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 1935 to 1937. During this time he traveled the country extensively meeting various school representatives of junior college libraries with the purpose of compiling a list of books for junior colleges. His compilation was published as "List of Books for Junior College Libraries" by the American Library Association (ALA) in 1937.
From 1938 to 1946, he was Librarian of Washington and Lee University. During his tenure there he was responsible for completing renovations to the Library building as well as developing special collections.
Military career.
During World War II, the Library of Congress was interested in protecting some of its more valuable collections and Mohrhardt offered surplus space available at Washington and Lee University for this purpose. Mohrhardt also performed military service during the war, serving in both the U.S. Army Air Corps and the U.S. Navy.
In 1946, he served as chief of the Library and Reports Division, Office of Technical Services. This agency was responsible for collecting, disseminating and indexing various civilian and military documents and evaluating their use in the public and private sector.
Teaching librarianship.
Mohrhardt then simultaneously served as a consultant at Brookhaven National Laboratory and visiting professor at Columbia University from 1947 to 1948. His activities at Brookhaven National Laboratory are unknown due to a lack of records. While at Columbia University, Mohrhardt taught courses in library management and collection development until autumn 1948 when he returned to federal service.
Library directorships.
Arriving at the Library Services for the Veteran's Administration, Mohrhardt worked as assistant director briefly until taking over as director. From 1948 to 1954 his responsibilities included 450 collections located domestically and overseas. He established a reputation for skillfully organizing and streamlining the procurement and cataloguing systems that endeared him for assignment to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Library.
Mohrhardt served as director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Library until his retirement from federal service in 1968. During his time there he helped accomplish the redesignation of the USDA Library to the National Agricultural Library, remarking that it had been a truly national library since its inception. Ever the organizer, Mohrhardt also set about reorganizing and streamlining the administration. He placed the functions of the library into four categories: Public Services, Technical Services, Field and Special Services, and Management Services. He then used these changes to facilitate coordination with various national and international agricultural libraries.
Associations.
During Mohrhart's time at the National Agricultural Library he was also active in numerous associations and commissions. Some positions he held included President of Association of Research Libraries, 1966, President of ALA, 1967-68, Vice President of the International Federation of Library Associations, 1965-71, President of the National Federation of Science Abstracting and Indexing Services, 1964-65, and chairman of the U.S. National Commission for FID in 1965. His work with these associations, particularly the International Federation of Library Associations, demonstrated his reputation as an international diplomat. This can be characterized by one incident that occurred during a board meeting when an Eastern-bloc representative became distraught at the course of dialogue. Mohrhardt reportedly left the room and returned with a flower for the woman and was able to defuse the tense situation with his charm.
Legacy.
Morhardt died on June 7, 1992, in Arlington, Virginia, leaving his wife Katherine, son David and daughter Katri Nowak. He experienced a long and productive career that left an indelible mark on his field. His greatest achievement was the transformation of the National Agricultural Library, establishing it alongside the Library of Congress and the National Library of Medicine as the defining institutions of their fields. In addition to this he built a reputation as a professional dedicated to the organization and use of knowledge for the public. He was able to see beyond the borders of his own nation and worked with people from around the world productively in order to ensure that knowledge was shared so all humankind could benefit.

<doc id="19402351" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19402351" title="The Dragon's Call">
The Dragon's Call

"The Dragon's Call" is the first episode of the first series of the British fantasy-adventure family television series "Merlin". Written by Julian Jones and directed by James Hawes, the episode was first broadcast on BBC One on 20 September 2008.
The episode tells the arrival of Merlin (Colin Morgan) as a young man in Camelot, where magic is banned by King Uther Pendragon (Anthony Head). Taken under the wing of Camelot's physician, Gaius (Richard Wilson), he is warned that he must keep his innate magical ability a secret. In Camelot, he meets Uther's heir, the arrogant Prince Arthur (Bradley James), as well as Lady Morgana (Katie McGrath) and her handmaid, Guinevere (Angel Coulby). As a witch (Eve Myles) plans revenge on the King's heir for the execution of her son, Merlin is informed by a cryptic dragon (John Hurt) that his destiny is to protect Arthur.
"Merlin" was conceived by Julian Murphy and Johnny Capps to be an origin story for the characters of the Arthurian legends, with family-centered entertainment. Young actors with little experience were cast as the four lead characters, while better-known actors were cast in supporting roles. Many of the scenes in Camelot were filmed in France, at the Château de Pierrefonds, while the rest was filmed in England and Wales. Special effects were done by The Mill, who had the task of creating the talking dragon. "The Dragon's Call" was watched by 7.15 million viewers in the UK and 6.3 million in the US on NBC. Critical reception was mixed, with some feeling the show had promise but lacked imagination, and the actual plot of "The Dragon's Call" was deemed slight.
Plot.
Merlin (Colin Morgan), a young sorcerer, arrives in Camelot just in time to witnesse the execution of Thomas Collins, a man accused of sorcery, by the order of King Uther Pendragon (Anthony Head), who has banned the practice of magic in his kingdom on pain of death. As soon as the man is beheaded, Uther declares to the watching crowd that he shall throw a festival to celebrate twenty years since he wiped out magic and magicians from the kingdom. When he finishes his announcements, a hideous old hag, Thomas' mother Mary (Eve Myles), swears revenge for the murder of her son, "a son for a son!", before vanishing to avoid arrest. The King's ward, Morgana (Katie McGrath), warns that Uther may be making enemies through his hatred and radical methods of wiping out magic.
Merlin reports to Camelot's physician Gaius (Richard Wilson) and saves the old man's life when he falls from a balcony by magically moving a mattress to cushion his fall. Though initially denying his abilities, Merlin later admits that he has had magical powers since birth, which Gaius warns him to keep secret. Reading a letter from Merlin's mother, Gaius realises that the boy was sent to Camelot for protection. Meanwhile, in the forest outside Camelot, Mary kills Lady Helen (Myles), a singer who is to perform at Uther's court, with a poppet. Mary assumes Helen's appearance using an enchantment, though her true hideous appearance can still be seen in mirrors and water.
Outside, Merlin stands up for a servant who is being bullied by his master, but as the master turns out to be the King's spoiled son, Arthur (Bradley James), Merlin is imprisoned. For the second night in a row, he hears a voice calling his name. Gaius frees him the next morning, though Merlin has to spend time in the stocks. There he meets Morgana's handmaiden Guinevere or "Gwen" (Angel Coulby), who commends him for being brave. Merlin confronts Arthur after being released, who tricks him into a fight with maces. Merlin keeps Arthur away using magic, which is met with ridicule by Gaius. Hearing the same voice calling his name that night, Merlin follows it to a cave where a dragon (John Hurt) informs him that he is destined to protect Arthur with his powers.
Gaius instructs Merlin to deliver elixirs to Morgana and Lady Helen; in the latter's room he finds the poppet, but bluffs his way out of discovery. Later, Helen kills a handmaiden who glimpses her true form in a mirror. At the feast, Mary sings an enchantment as Lady Helen, causing all the guests to fall asleep. Merlin, realising what is going on, covers his ears. Mary attempts to kill Arthur, but Merlin drops a chandelier on her with magic before she releases the dagger. As she has stopped singing, the enchantment is lifted and her true appearance is revealed. In a last effort she throws the dagger at Arthur, but Merlin slows time to pull him out of the way. Mary dies from her injuries, having failed in her attempt to avenge her son. Uther rewards Merlin by making him Arthur's servant, though neither boy is thrilled with the idea. The next day, Gaius gives Merlin a book on magic, under condition that he keep it hidden.
Production.
Conception and development.
"Merlin" was conceived by Shine Television producers Julian Murphy and Johnny Capps, who had worked together on "Hex", a fantasy series produced by Shine for Sky One. The two had enjoyed presenting a "high-concept" show, and wished to do more. The BBC had been interested in broadcasting a drama based on the character of Merlin for some time; a little over a year before the Shine series was initiated, writer and producer Chris Chibnall had been developing a project aimed at a BBC One Sunday night slot, which was ultimately not commissioned. The programme was intended for family entertainment and designed to appeal to a wide audience.
As the Arthurian legends do not reflect genuine historical events, not being set in any one singular period in time, the show's creators were more interested in conveying a world that felt "real". Not constrained by historical accuracy, they had many opportunities to build the world in which they set their series; for example, tomatoes were included despite being absent from Europe in the Medieval era, and there was never a dragon in the earliest texts involving Merlin. The series was intended to have an "epic scale" that would have a wide "cross-generational" appeal; films such as "Raiders of the Lost Arc" were cited as inspiration. Despite this, the creators strived to have smaller moments that the audience could relate to and comedy to lighten the darker tone. A fairy-tale aspect was also incorporated - highlighted in "The Dragon's Call" with the singing and cobwebs - to set the programme apart from others. "Beauty and the Beast" was an inspiration in this respect. "Merlin" was also influenced by the US show "Smallville", about the early years of Superman; Murphy and Capps said that "Smallville" helped provide the idea of a "Camelot that existed before its golden age". The creators wanted to show Merlin, Arthur, Gwen and Morgana in their youth, "before they were famous". Murphy and Capps intended for the four young characters and situations to be relatable to young viewers. They also put the characters in unusual positions with respect to their later, well-known roles to make the audience wonder how they would reach those roles; for example, Guinevere, the future Queen of Camelot and wife of Arthur, is a servant with a romantic interest in Merlin. Looking back at "The Dragon's Call", Murphy and Capps felt that it had so much to introduce in terms of world and characters that there was not enough of the main plot of the episode.
Casting.
The producers were aware that they would be casting young actors with little experience in film and television. Hundreds were seen for the part of Merlin, with the part going to 22-year-old Colin Morgan, whom Murphy and Capps felt possessed a broad acting range with good comedic timing and wonder, and who they felt would most importantly be likable to the audience. Bradley James was cast as Prince Arthur, whom the producers saw as a "medieval Prince Harry". They felt that James' sense of comedy balanced the fact that the character was intended to first appear acting like an "idiot". Murphy and Capps had previously worked with James on a pilot, and kept him in the "back of minds" when casting Arthur. Katie McGrath and Angel Coulby, who play Morgana and Gwen respectively, also had little previous professional acting experience. Despite this, it was noted that all four young actors took to their jobs maturely and with energy.
The series also incorporates more experienced and well-known actors. Richard Wilson was cast as Gaius, who was conceived to have a dysfunctional father/son relationship with Merlin. Murphy and Capps had worked with Wilson before and considered him a broad actor with a "warmth" and "humanity" that would fit the character. The voice of the Great Dragon was given to John Hurt; he was offered the part, though the producers did not expect him to accept. The role of King Uther went to veteran actor Anthony Head, who was best known for his role as Rupert Giles in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer". Head had been one of the first choices for the part; Murphy and Capps felt that he was good with "high-concept" worlds. Murphy and Capps had also previously worked with Caroline Faber, who briefly appears as Merlin's mother. The two liked her sense of humanity, though her scene — where Gaius reads her letter — was almost cut from "The Dragon's Call". Eve Myles guest stars in "The Dragon's Call" as the villain Mary Collins and her host body Lady Helen. Murphy and Capps remarked that Myles gave a "big" but "truthful" performance, and really "embraced" being a villain. Myles sang during the filming of the climax, though her voice was replaced with a real operatic soprano in post-production. Composer Rob Lane was given little time to complete the song and, though he was given Old English texts, the lyrics do not make actual sense.
Filming.
"Merlin" began production in March 2008; as many as three episodes were filmed at a time, and not necessarily in the correct order. Many scenes in Camelot were filmed in France at the Château de Pierrefonds, which was hand-picked by the production team. Castles in England had been looked at, but they were often in ruins and would require more computer-generated imagery (CGI) effects in post-production. A medieval-era road was built around Pierrefonds for some scenes to give the sense of a town, as the castle was in isolation. The execution scene was one of the first major scenes shot. As the production team had to be able to work with French extras, a bilingual crew was required. The cell Merlin is imprisoned in and the banquet hall at the end were both filmed in English stately homes, with real medieval architecture. Other studio filming took place in Wales. The scene at the camp where Lady Helen stays had to be reshot because the tent was seen as "too Monty Python" and distracting.
Myles' Mary Collins prosthetic took six hours to accomplish, and the shot where she morphs into the younger Lady Helen took seven hours to complete because it required three stages of make-up. Her first performance at the beheading scene was met with applause by the extras; Head requested that he redo his part of the scene because he felt that it was not good enough. Gaius' fall from the balcony was done by a stuntman and filmed with a high-speed camera. The mattress that Merlin magically moves across the floor was achieved with rigging it up to hidden wires and pulleys under the set. The knives Arthur throws were actually shot out of a nitrogen gun; James did throw them in a separate shot, but against a cloth that he still missed. Fake fruit was made for the stocks scene, but it was deemed too fake-looking and was replaced with real tomatoes. The mace fight was originally filmed with plastic maces, but they were not believable as they did not have enough weight. The scene was then shot with real steel maces; it was one of the most complex and hardest scenes to execute. The climax, where the guests all fall asleep and are covered by cobwebs, took many days to complete. The chandelier falling was also considered difficult.
CGI special effects for the series were provided by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but they were worried about the lip sync and did not think it would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.
Broadcast and reception.
"The Dragon's Call" was first broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 20 September 2008. Overnight ratings showed that the episode had been wached by 6.65 million viewers live, a 30% audience share, placing "Merlin" second for the night behind ITV's "The X-Factor". The episode received a final rating of 7.15 million viewers, the sixth most-watched programme of the week on BBC One.
In the United States, "The Dragon's Call" was aired back-to-back with the following episode "Valiant" on 21 June 2009 on network station NBC, the first time since 1978's "The New Avengers" that a British programme was picked up by one of the U.S.'s four major terrestrial networks, rather than cable. The premiere was watched by an average 5.2 million viewers, with an average of 6.3 million during the slot for "The Dragon's Call".
Critical reception.
The premiere of "Merlin" received generally mixed reviews. Sam Wollaston of "The Guardian" was optimistic towards the programme, despite the violent content. He wrote that "Morgan is a very likable young Merlin" and the show "looks splendid — colourful, exciting, and yes, magic". Daniel Martin of the same paper felt that the series had potential, though "The Dragon's Call" had "awful dialogue" and was "a flimsy caper memorable only for centring around the wonderful big-eyed Eve Myles". "The Hollywood Reporter" reviewer Randee Dawn felt that it would "hurt eyes" of those who were familiar with the Arthurian legends, but "for those new to the legend, this is a fresh, and delightfully color-blind, approach to the tale". Alessandra Stanley, reviewing for "The New York Times", was pleased with the diversity of the cast and the chemistry between Morgan and James, though she felt it "would be better if its creators had taken more liberties and shown more imagination in coloring in the background of their young hero's world".
"Metro" gave the episode three out of five stars, writing that "Colin Morgan makes a likeable boy wizard but there’s a bit too much formula – and not in the magical sense". The review described the episode as a "test of patience" due to Merlin's inability to use magic and the "hideously jaunty, distinctly non-medieval soundtrack". Tom Shales of "The Washington Post" criticised the "sluggish pace" of the premiere, noting that the episode was only "brightened" by the dragon, though similar creatures were common in the genre and it "lacks personality as well as panache". Shales felt that the series took "the stuff of legend and imagination and makes it dry and commonplace". Den of Geek reviewer Mark Pickavance felt that the episode was "uneven and often very stilted", and failed at introducing both the characters and telling the story of the first meeting of Arthur and Merlin. He was displeased with the deviation from established mythology and the lapses in logic. "The Times" AA Gill described "Merlin" as "bland", writing that it was for "a large untapped audience that yearns for Abercrombie & Fitch drama". Hermione Eyre of "The Independent" called it "horrible", disliking the "modern" feeling, the "awful" make-up, and commented that "Guinevere looks like a supply teacher".

Theophany Convent, Kostroma

Bogoyavlensky Convent () is one of the most populous Russian Orthodox convents. It is situated in Kostroma and is known as the location of the ancient Feodorovskaya Icon of God's Mother.
It was founded as Bogoyavlensky Monastery in the 15th century by Nikita, a disciple and a relative of St Sergius of Radonezh.
The five-domed katholikon of traditional Byzantine design was constructed under Ivan the Terrible, starting in 1559. The Tsar accused the father superior and some of the brethren of supporting his rival Vladimir of Staritsa and had them executed in 1570.
The monastery was besieged and taken by Aleksander Józef Lisowski during the Time of Troubles. The attack claimed the lives of 11 monks. A monastic house dates from the 17th century. The other buildings arose from the monastery's reconstruction in the Russian Revival style in the late 19th century. In 1863 the monastery was transformed into the convent.
After the Revolution the convent was abolished and was not revived until the 1990s. The remains of the wall paintings in the katholikon were destroyed in a recent fire.

Title (command)

In computing, codice_1 is a command in various command line interpreters (shells) such as the Microsoft Windows Command Prompt, the Command Processor Shell of Windows Embedded CE and Take Command that changes the title for the graphical terminal emulator window.
The command is also used within DFS and ADFS to change the title of the disc in the current drive.
In case of the Windows Command Prompt it is a shell builtin of the command line interpreter codice_2.
The default window title is defined in the %COMSPEC% environment variable. However, since the Win32 console title can also be defined in the program shortcut, the title is usually set to "Command Prompt".
The command is available in Windows 2000 and later.
Although the OS/2 command shell is closely related to the Windows Command Prompt, the codice_1 command is not available in the OS/2 version of codice_2. The default title of the OS/2 shell window is "OS/2 Window". It can be changed using the codice_5 command.
The command also is not available in the Mac OS X Terminal. Instead, the codice_6 command can be used in combination with special escape sequences.
Within the GNU GRUB command processor codice_1 is one of several menu-specific commands. It is used to start a new boot entry.

__NOTOC__
The Letov Š-20 was a fighter aircraft produced in Czechoslovakia during the 1920s. 
Design and development.
The Letov Š-20 was a conventional, single-bay biplane with unstaggered wings braced by N-struts. In overall appearance, it greatly resembled contemporary SPAD fighters. The fuselage and empennage were of welded steel tube construction and covered in fabric. The wings had a tubular metal spar but were otherwise wooden, and also fabric-skinned.
The Czechoslovakian Air Force bought 105 machines, and 10 examples were produced for Lithuania under the designation Š-20L. These remained in service until 1936 and 1935 respectively.
Operational history.
An Š-20 placed second in the single-engine category of the national President of the Republic air race in 1925, but fared better the following year. In the 1926 race, an Š-20 not only won this category but also set a new national airspeed record of 234 km/h (146 mph). This record was short-lived, however, since the prize for the fastest circuit was also won in an Š-20, and this raised the record to 245 km/h (153 mph).
A single prototype of an unarmed advanced trainer version was built as the Š-21, but this did not sell.

Microsynodontis

Microsynodontis is a genus of upside-down catfishes native to Africa.
"Microsynodontis" species are occasionally imported for the aquarium trade. Very little is known about their biology.
Description.
It can be difficult to identify species of "Microsynodontis" as their coloration can be highly variable within each species, and color patterns may even change as a fish grows; to identify based on coloration, an understanding of the limits of variation is necessary.
"Microsynodontis" species express sexual dimorphism. Males can be distinguished by the presence of a conical genital papilla immediately posterior to the anus; in females, this papilla is smaller and has a flattened tip. Males also have a much denser aggregation of tubercles on the head. In "M. hirsutus" these tubercles are longer than in the other species.
Species.
There are currently 12 recognized species in this genus:

Władysław Mackiewicz

Wladyslaw Mackiewicz (21 December 1903 – 19 May 1963) was a Polish Cavalry Captain (rotmistrz) in the 15th Uhlan Regiment and a recipient of the Virtuti Militari, Poland's highest decoration.
He was 17 when the Polish - Russian war broke out (it seems that he did not take part).
From 15 August 1927 till June – August 1928 he graduated 5th class of Cavalry Officer Cadet School in Grudziadz.
In 1930 he was a cavalry sub-lieutenant with a rank adulthood starting with 15 August 1927. In that time he served in 7th Uhlan Regiment in Minsk Mazowiecki.
Wladyslaw Mackiewicz was a sub-lieutenant in the 7th Regiment
According to pictures (a round, English-style cap) he served also in a prestigious 1st Lancers Regiment in Warsaw somewhere in the 30'ties.
On 1 March 1939, Wladyslaw Mackiewicz as a lieutenant was an administration officer in the 15th Uhlan Regiment in Poznan.
On 19 March he was promoted to cavalry captain. Starting with 3 April 1939 he became a commander of the 2nd Cavalry Squadron in the Regiment but he didn't take over his duties until the 12th of May 1939. Seven days later, that is on 19 May he arrived back to Central Cavalry School in Grudziadz to take part in the XXI Cavalry Squadron Commanders course.
Also in 1939 he received a of the 15th Uhlan Regiment which was considered as becoming a part of the unit.
On the day of German attack he was a commander of the 2nd Squadron in the 15th Uhlan Regiment, which was a part of Wielkopolska Cavalry Brigade. The Regiment including Wladyslaw Mackiewicz Squadron, started a big counter offensive, which is known as a Bzura Battle (9–18 September) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bzura). This is considered to be the 15th Uhlan Regiment during the battle
For his courageous achievements he was granted, by col. Strzelecki (who was a substitute commander for a wounded gen. Abraham), at the last gathering of the unit in Warsaw (27 September) he received a highest Polish Army medal – Virtuti Militari. He became a Prisoner of War and was taken to Murnau prison of war camp for Officers.
Commander of the 15th Regiment makes his last goodbyes to his soldiers on 27 September 1939 after the ceremony during which Wladyslaw Mackiewicz received a medal.
Wladyslaw Mackiewicz reached the re-established 15th Uhlans Regiment in Italy in the II Polish Corps, and was probably a staff officer. Then the regiment was transported to Egypt and after that again to Italy. In June 1946 the unit was redeployed to Browning Camp (Horsham near London). In 1947 the unit was disbanded.
Some of the soldiers went back home. All of them were arrested and kept (tortured) in prisons until 1956. Western Allies never allowed Poles to take part in a Victory Parade in London as the only nation that didn't take part.

Ernest Hayes (British Army soldier)

Ernest Hayes Military Medal and Two Bars was a Corporal in the British Army. He was awarded the Military Medal three times for his conduct in World War I. He was one of only 180 men out of 115,600 to be awarded the Medal three times for his actions in that conflict.
Early life.
Ernest Hayes was born on 16 April 1898, in Cotgrave, Nottinghamshire. 
Military career.
Hayes enlisted with the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, also known as the KOYLI, in 1916. After initial training in England, he was then transferred to the Western front in France. During his time there, he took part in several major battles.
He was awarded his first MM on 13 March 1918. In the London Gazette it reads: "203928 Pte. E. Hayes, Yorks. L.I. (Cotgrave)". His second MM was awarded for his part in securing the Sambre canal on 4 November 1918. The citation from the Army for his actions that day reads as:
"No. 203928 Cpl. E. Hayes:- For gallantry & devotion to duty during the successful attack on the Sambre canal, S.W. of Landrecies on the 4th of November 1918. In the face of an intense enemy artillery & machine gun barrage he led his Lewis gun section forward through very close country with great skill, onto his objective. On arrival there he consolidated his post & for some hours kept his gun team in action under heavy enemy fire. He was utterly regardless of personal danger & his calm method of picking up target after target had a most inspiring effect on the men in his post & other posts in his vicinity".

The Forged Coupon

The Forged Coupon (, Fal'shivyi kupon) is a novella in two parts by Leo Tolstoy. Though he first conceived of the story in the late 1890s, he did not begin writing it until 1902. After struggling for several years, he finally completed the story in 1904; however, it was not published until some of Tolstoy's shorter works were collected and anthologized after his death in 1910.
Synopsis.
The story is divided into two parts. In Part I, schoolboy Mitya is in desperate need of money to repay a debt, but his father angrily denies him assistance. Dejected, under the instigation of a friend Makhin, Mitya simply changes a $2.50 note to read $12.50, but this one evil deed sets off a chain of events that affects the lives of dozens of others, when his one falsehood indirectly causes a man to murder a woman at the end of Part I, and then seek redemption through religion in Part II.
Having written the novella in his dying years, after his excommunication, Tolstoy relishes the chance to unveil the "pseudo-piety and hypocrisy of organized religion." Yet, he maintains an unwavering belief in man's capacity to find truth, so the story remains hopeful, especially in Part II, which shows that good works can affect another as in a domino effect, just as evil does in Part I. The novella has also been translated with the title "The Counterfeit Note" and "The Forged Banknote."
Adaptations.
Robert Bresson used Part I as the basis for his last film, "L'Argent" (1983), transposing the action from early nineteenth century tsarist Russia to capitalistic, present-day France. Bresson merges the characters of Ivan Mirinov and Stepán into "Yvon Targe", thus providing the ensemble cast with a concise protagonist and focusing more specifically in his story. Because Part II is completely omitted, there is no redeeming the many characters and their crimes that lead up to murder in Part I.
The film "Frozen Land" () is a 2005 critically acclaimed dark Finnish film drama directed and written by Aku Louhimies that is based on Part I and set in contemporary Finland.

James Bray (cricketer, born 1790)

James Bray (born 11 October 1790 at Waldron, Essex; died 31 January 1869 at Waldron) was an English professional cricketer who played first-class cricket from 1816 to 1828. He was mainly associated with Sussex and made 8 known appearances in first-class matches, including 2 matches for The Bs between 1817 and 1828.
Bray made his first-class debut in 1816, playing for Sussex against Epsom. He made a steady start to his career, batting in the upper-middle order. The following year, he made two first-class appearances, before taking nine years out of the game.
He returned to the cricketing scene in 1826, when he moved from Sussex to Kent. The first game he played for Kent saw his former team, and opponents, finish on 23 all out, which remains one of the team's lowest first-class scores.
Bray made three further first-class appearances following the end of 1826, including two for Kent. His final first-class appearance saw him play for The Bs against an England team which included William Lillywhite.
It is unclear whether Bray is a relation of James Bray (1853–98), who played for Kent between 1879 and 1882.

Macchi M.52

__NOTOC__
The Macchi M.52 was an Italian racing seaplane designed and built by Macchi for the 1927 Schneider Trophy race. The M.52 and a later variant, the M.52bis or M.52R, both set world speed records for seaplanes.
Design and development.
M.52.
Mario Castoldi (1888–1968) designed the M.52, following the formula he used in designing the successful Macchi M.39, which Major Mario de Bernardi (1893–1959) piloted to victory and a world seaplane speed record in the 1926 Schneider Trophy race and to another world seaplane speed record four days later. Like the M.39, the M.52 was a single-engined, low-wing monoplane on twin floats. Slightly smaller than the M.39, it was powered by a much more powerful engine, the Fiat AS.3. Despite the significant increase in engine power, the M.52 had a maximum takeoff weight less than that of the M.39. Macchi built three M.52s.
M.52bis or M.52R.
A restyled version, known both as the M.52bis and M.52R, also was built. Its wingspan ( and maximum takeoff weight were reduced further from that of the M.52, and it had streamlining improvements including floats with a smaller frontal area. Macchi built a single M.52bis.
Operational history.
M.52.
Italy entered all three M.52s in the 1927 Schneider Trophy race, which was held at Venice, Italy, on 26 September 1927. All three suffered engine trouble, and none of them finished the race; the 1926 winner de Bernardi officially finished 10th after dropping out, and the best result among the M.52s was that achieved by the one piloted by Captain Federico Guazetti, which did not drop out of the race until the final lap. Major de Bernardi, however, used one of the M.52s to establish a new world speed record of over a course at Venice on 4 November 1927.
M.52bis or M.52R.
At Venice on 30 March 1928, de Bernardi, flying the lone M.52bis (or M.52R), set a new world speed record of . De Bernardi thus became both the first person to exceed 300 miles per hour (483 km/h) and the first person to exceed 500 kilometres per hour (310 mph).
Although Italy had planned to enter all three of the later Macchi M.67 racing seaplanes in the 1929 Schneider Trophy race, one of them crashed during training. As a substitute, the M.52R was entered alongside the two surviving M.67s to represent Italy in the race, which took place on 7 September 1929. Flown by Warrant Officer Tommasso Dal Molin, it was the only one of the three Italian aircraft to finish, gaining second place with a speed of 457.380 km/h (284.203 mph).

VCloud

vCloud is a cloud computing initiative from VMware which will allow customers to migrate work on demand
from their "internal cloud" of cooperating VMware hypervisors to a remote cloud of VMware hypervisors. The goal of the initiative is to provide the power of cloud computing with the flexibility allowed by virtualization.
The initiative was announced at the 2008 VMworld conference in Las Vegas and garnered significant press attention.
At the 2009 VMworld conference in San Francisco vCloud was featured in the vCloud Pavilion. vCloud was also a subject at the 2010 conference. The vCloud initiative has grown with many public service providers and multiple supporting applications.
vCloud architecture relies on vShield edge for its operation, routed networks in vCloud needs a VM running vShield-edge software, acting as the default gateway of that network. This virtual gateway is implemented on a free host on the system and provides its services to VMs on that host and on other hosts.
Hybrid vCloud solutions.
vCloud supports so called "hybrid" cloud solutions where a customer runs (part of) his cloud on his own dedicated hardware with the ability to move VM's running on the private infrastructure to the public cloud. This will give the user even extra flexibility: when external events (or seasonal effects) lead to a large extra increase in required computing (and/or storage) demand, the cloud manager can start using cloud services from his external provider.
If business rules require that some business critical or sensitive systems remain on self-owned infrastructure he can simply move less sensitive systems to the public cloud and free up resources on his own infrastructure. And when the need for the additional power is gone he can migrate back to their own systems. Although this functionality is part of the VMware vCloud suite of products: VMware doesn't offer (public) cloud services themselves: this is done via 3rd parties. One of such providers is Dell: that company offers complete vCloud solutions, including the hardware and software for the private cloud (based on Dell PowerEdge servers, Force10 network-infrastructure, consultancy, pro-support support and pro-active maintenance etc. But they also offer the required public cloud services to where customers can "push" some or all of their cloud systems
For (potential) users of these services it is important to consider where their (sensitive) data will be stored is/when using public cloud services and under which jurisdiction the provider of the services fall. In the example of Dell: that is an American company and the American government assumes a lot of freedom of data they can demand from cloud providers (or any company handling data), regardless of the actual location of the data or nationality of the customer.

__NOTOC__
The Letov Š-32 was an airliner produced in small numbers in Czechoslovakia during the 1930s. It was a trimotor monoplane with a high, cantilever wing, and was designed to meet a requirement by ČSA for a machine to service a night route between Prague, Bratislava, Uzhorod, and Bucharest. It could carry up to six passengers in a fully enclosed cabin which was praised at the time as being "particularly roomy and lofty". The wings were of all-metal construction, and the fuselage was built up from steel tube and was mostly skinned in metal, other than its very rear part, which, like the empennage, was skinned in fabric. 
ČSA bought and operated four of these machines. On 26 June 1934, one of these (registered OK-ADB) crashed during final approach to Karlovy Vary, killing all three on board, most notably the famous Austrian actor Max Pallenberg.

In the passenger version, seats were arranged inside the 2.3-meter thick (7 ft 7 in) wings. The airframe was welded from "KhMA" chrome-molybdenum steel. The original design called for six engines in the wing leading edge but when the projected loaded weight was exceeded, two more engines were added to the trailing edges of each wing, one right and one left of the central passenger pod. However, Nemecek states in his book that there was only one further pusher engine added;
Design and development.
Designed by World War I and Civil war pilot Konstantin Kalinin at the aviation design bureau he headed in Kharkov, with a wingspan close to that of a B-52 and a much greater wing area, the K-7 was one of the biggest aircraft built before the jet age. It had an unusual arrangement of six tractor engines on the wing leading edge and a single in pusher configuration at the rear.
In civil transport configuration, it would have had a capacity for 120 passengers and of mail. As a troop transport it would have had capacity for 112 fully equipped paratroopers. In bomber configuration it would have been armed with 8 x 20mm autocannons, 8 x 7.62mm machine guns and up to of bombs.
The K-7 was built in two years at Kharkiv starting in 1931.
The K-7 first flew on 11 August 1933. The very brief first flight showed instability and serious vibration caused by the airframe resonating with the engine frequency. The solution to this was thought to be to shorten and strengthen the tail booms, little being known then about the natural frequencies of structures and their response to vibration. The aircraft completed seven test flights before a crash due to structural failure of one of the tail booms on 21 November 1933. 
The existence of the aircraft had only recently been announced by Pravda which declared it was " victory of the utmost political importance" since it had been built with steel produced in the USSR rather than imported.
The accident killed 14 people aboard and one on the ground. "Flight" speculated that sabotage was suspected as the investigating committee had representation by the state security organization, the Joint State Political Directorate (OGPU).
However, there appeared recently some speculations in the Russian aviation press about the role of politics and competing design office of Andrei Tupolev, suggesting possible sabotage. Although two more prototypes were ordered in 1933, the project was cancelled in 1935 before they could be completed.

Andrew Rebori

Andrew Nicholas Rebori (February 21, 1886 – May 31, 1966) was an American architect who was a member of the Chicago school of architecture.
Life and work.
Early life.
Born in New York City, Rebori was the son of an engineer who had immigrated to the U.S. from Italy. Rebori was friends during his childhood with future presidential nominee Al Smith. At age 15, Rebori began working in the office of New York architect Charles Alling Gifford making blueprints, and he also worked for architect Herbert D. Hale. Rebori finished evening high school at age 18. Later in Rebori's teen years, he studied under New York architect Henry Hornbostel.
From 1905 until 1907, Rebori attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he met his future wife, Nannie Prendergast of Wheaton, Illinois, whose farm adjoined that of the parents of Chicago Tribune publisher Robert R. McCormick. Rebori and Prendergast married in 1913. From 1908 until 1909, Rebori studied in the Ecole des Beaux Arts, subsequently working for the neo-classical architect Cass Gilbert in New York. Rebori earned a bachelor's degree from the Armour Institute of Technology in 1911.
Career and family.
In 1909, Rebori moved to Chicago as a professor of architecture at the Armour Institute. The following year, he met famed architect Louis Sullivan, who became a mentor to Rebori. Rebori worked in the office of architect Jarvis Hunt from 1914 until 1922, after which point he founded his own firm, Rebori, Wentworth, Dewey and McCormick. Rebori's firm eventually dissolved in 1932, and he worked in private practice by himself until 1940. He performed various wartime projects from 1941 until 1944, and then worked as a consulting architect for DeLeuw, Cather & Co. from 1944 until 1955. Rebori also worked in private practice from 1952 until 1961, when he retired.
Rebori had little use for most modern style buildings, which he once referred to as "steel and glass upside-down cakes." However, Rebori at the same time was known for his own pre-World War II modernist style, which was best seen in his Fisher Studio Houses development. And, he was well known for being willing to tailor his work to a client's request, making him more of an eclectic architect than anything else. "The architect is no longer an individualist, he is a follower," Rebori told the "Chicago Tribune" . "Today's architects just want to please their patrons." (December 22, 1963)
Rebori had two children. His son, Andrew P. Rebori (1916-1952), an army aviator during World War II, died of polio on September 15, 1952. Rebori's daughter, Naneen (sometimes shown as being spelled Nanneen) Rebori Donaldson (1914-1996), died on June 15, 1996. Rebori's wife, Nannie, died on May 16, 1917 in Chicago and after her funeral in Winfield, Illinois. near their summer home, she was buried in Calvary Cemetery, Illinois. 
Rebori died at his home at 6 E. Scott Street in Chicago on May 31, 1966. He is buried in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago.

<doc id="19402930" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19402930" title="Guildford Shuttle">
Guildford Shuttle

The Guildford Shuttle was a bus service linking together Guildford town centre. Starting in 2000, and running free, it was withdrawn in August 2008 following the withdrawal of its funding. It was re-introduced commercially by its previous operator in January 2009, branded as the "Town Centre Shuttle", however was withdrawn for a final time in May 2010.
History.
Introduction.
The service was originally introduced following a feasibility report by Guildford Borough Council to the policy and resources committee in October 1999. The initial aim of the service was to provide an extension of the recently introduced Artington park and ride service, by linking up the railway station, the bus station and Guildford town centre and High Street. As ideas developed the service was also thought to help businesses around Milkhouse Gate and Bakers Yard, who were at the time claiming loss of trade due to the Castle car park scheme. The service began operation in September 2000.
Lifespan.
Originally running as a six-month trial scheme, the contract was tendered annually until 2004, when a three-year agreement was reached, starting in 2005. Throughout the service's life, the route has been run by local bus company Safeguard Coaches. The route ran all day at a 20-minute frequency.
At first, a Dennis Dart SLF/Plaxton Pointer Mini Pointer Dart was acquired for Safeguard to use, but the council wanted to use an Optare Alero, one of which arrived slightly delayed later. However, this proved too small and so another Mini Pointer Dart was acquired. The length of vehicles able to run on the route has always been restricted due to a sharp left hand turn from Quary Street into Castle Street.
Withdrawal.
In July 2008, the council announced that it intended to withdraw the zero-fare service, claiming that it was costing too much to operate and not enough people were using the service. This was met with fierce opposition by users, the local Liberal Democrats challenging the decision. Campaigners tried to keep the service running, one 91-year old man, Bill Bellerby, staying on the bus for a whole day non-stop while it travelled the route and surveying users of the service.
A decision to replace the service with an advance booking "dial-a-ride" service was met with resistance, users claiming it was "inflexible" and that "people don’t know days in advance when they will want to go somewhere and when they want to be picked up." Campaigners also reject the idea that there are commercial bus services that provide a replacement. General acceptance is that the commercial bus network in the town is good, but around half of the route is on roads unserved by other buses. One councillor said that operating the service may be illegal if commercial services are available.
Some success for the campaigners was for the council’s environment and housing scrutiny committee to ask the executive to rethink the decision to end the service. However, in a further step Safeguard said that they were now "unwilling" to operate the service.
The service ended on 30 August 2008 as planned. Following this, there were further campaigns to reintroduce the service. One report appeared in the local paper comparing the shuttle and the route of commercial bus services, further criticising the council's view that existing replacements operate. Examples given were the fact that users have to go to the back of the railway station, a long way out and not wheelchair accessible. Also, the most similar commercial bus route, Arriva Guildford & West Surrey's number 36, serves the bus station on its way up the hill in Guildford, as a result continuing around a one-way street and emerging halfway up North Street. This contrasts with the shuttle, which ran to the Lower High street. When the shuttle was withdrawn, no bus services stopped there.
The town's local newspaper, the Surrey Advertiser, led a campaign entitled "Bring back our bus" through the protests. In one edition a whole page was dedicated to letter on the subject.
At the end of September 2008 Guildford's most senior politician, MP Anne Milton, backed the newspaper's campaign, saying that she had asked the council to "consider its decision" and that the bus "is more important with the post office having moved further up the street". Joining her calls, Liberal Democrat MP Sue Doughty said the replacements proposed are "quite inappropriate", "poorly thought through", and that the bus was "essential".
The beginning of October 2008 brought a new development. A group of residents applied to get a petition launched on Gordon Brown’s personal website, bringing the debate to Downing Street.
In mid-October Guildford Borough Council announced the replacement for the shuttle, the "Town Centre Rider". Journeys would have to be pre-booked and the service would pick up and drop off at pre-designated spots, rather than traveling frequently over a predetermined route. This triggered criticism, people saying it was much less flexible and was inconvenient to people who were visiting several places. Only people with mobility problems and those aged over 60, as well as their carers, could use the service. It started on 20 October.
At the beginning of November, it emerged that the Town Centre Rider replacement had experienced a very poor initial take-up, only being used five times during its first two weeks.
By mid-November, a large petition had been created. The 2,380-name petition was handed to Councillor Jennifer Jordan at the borough council's offices by the 91-year old campaigner Bill Bellerby. The signatures were gained during two four-hour sessions in Guildford's High Street. The petition also brought about further criticism of the council's spending plans. The council withdrew the service on the grounds that it would cost £100,000 to run in the next year, which was too much, yet it was noted that a month earlier they had agreed to spend £54,000 developing a pop-up toilet.
Reinstatement.
Just after the petition was handed in (in mid-November) the original operators of the route, Safeguard Coaches, announced that they were to operate the route as a commercial service. It would operate at reduced hours, from 10am to 2pm, but would be expanded to cover the Mount Alvernia Hospital. Operating hours would be expanded if the service was popular. It was planned that a £1.20 flat fare would be charged, although over 60s and people with disabilities could still travel free under the Government's free bus travel scheme, which Safeguard would be reimbursed for from Surrey County Council. The borough council offered its million pound-plus marketing budget to help with publicity for the new service.
At the end of November the bus used on the service was repainted into Safeguard's own bus livery.
By the beginning of January 2009 the service was ready to be launched. An article appeared in the Surrey Advertiser, Safeguard's managing director Andrew Halliday saying he expects the service to be a success. By this time the planned operation hours had varied slightly to be a more specific 10.15am to 2.15pm; the fares also had changed, a single flat fare for people that have to pay would now be £1 with a £1.50 all day ticket available. Safeguard was reported to be in talks with businesses in the town about sponsorship deals.
The service started on Monday 12 January 2009 after a launch on the previous Friday 9 January, where the bus was named after campaigner Bill Bellerby. The full name is "Honorary Freeman Bill Bellerby MBE". Some were angered at the presence of Councillor Andrew Hodges, leader of the council who withdrew the original service.
It was reported that the council's Town Rider replacement may be withdrawn if the new shuttle was a success.
Final withdrawal.
The new commercial service ran for just over a year. However, as part of an agreement between Safeguard and Arriva Guildford & West Surrey, the two companies agreed to stop sharing routes 3, 4 and 5 from 23 May 2010. Safeguard took over full operation of routes 4 and 5 and Arriva the 3. At the same time of, and a partial result of, the agreement the Guildford Shuttle was withdrawn. The last day of operation was 22 May 2010.
According to Safeguard, the number of passengers on the service stood at 1,800 a month, which "was not enough to sustain the service in the long-term." The dedicated bus was reallocated to Safeguard's increased operations of routes 4 and 5.
Route.
The shuttle ran a mainly anti-clockwise circular service around Guildford town centre, although ran in a figure of eight to get to the railway station due to the town's one-way system. The service started at 1015 and ran every 20 minutes throughout the day until 1415.

Herman van Speult

Herman van Speult (?? – Mocha, Yemen, August 1626) was a merchant in service of the Dutch East India Company. Van Speult left the island Texel in 1613, heading for Bantam and arrived after a journey of ten months. He was formerly employed in Spain, "whence he came, if report be true, full of the pox." He was active as governor of Ambon from 1618 until 1625.
In 1618 he was appointed as governor of the Governorate of Ambon as the succeeder of Adriaen Maertensz. Block and Steven van der Hagen. 
On 21 January 1623 had he prepared two ships for an expedition to islands near New Guinea, to map more of New Guinea, and to explore for "the South Land". The crew discovered possibly the present Jardine River and most likely Speult Land and Speult Point were named after him. 
Only a few weeks later Van Speult believed that English merchants, helped by Japanese mercenaries, planned to kill him and overwhelm the Dutch garrison as soon as an English ship arrived to support them. This led to the Amboyna massacre. It remained a source of tension between the two nations until late in the 17th century. Harman Van Speult died in the Red Sea.

Nepal Youth Foundation

The Nepal Youth Foundation (NYF) is a U.S.-based nonprofit organization. The mission of NYF is to provide children in Nepal with education, housing, medical care, and support. 
The Nepal Youth Foundation's partners are private foundations and individuals around the world and non-governmental organizations in Nepal. NYF was founded in 1990 by Olga Murray under the name Nepalese Youth Opportunity Foundation (NYOF), which was later changed to the current name. Olga Murray is still the organization's president. NYF rescues and supports children in Nepal through a range of programs.
About Nepal.
The vast majority of the people of Nepal are subsistence farmers, living far from roads, electricity, or social services. The average national income is $200. Most people are illiterate. Cultural and legal traditions make it difficult for women to assert their basic human rights and receive health care and a decent education. According to UNICEF, half of all Nepali children under age five are malnourished, one of the leading causes of death in this age group.
Liberating Girls from Indentured Servitude.
In parts of Western Nepal, many indigenous families subsist as farm laborers. Unable to make ends meet, thousands of them have been forced to sell their daughters to work in faraway cities as bonded servants. An ABC News report states that many of the girls, who are as young as six, never return home, while others are abused or forced into prostitution. Very few of the girls ever attend school. The fathers receive an average of US$50 a year for their daughters’ services, and the girls get nothing. 
The Nepal Youth Foundation's Indentured Daughters Program provides an alternative. The organization works with local communities to encourage parents to bring their daughters home from the city and provides a piglet or goat which the families can raise and sell. NYOF then ensures the girls attend local schools. Thousands of rescued girls now attend school under the Nepal Youth Foundation’s auspices. There are many thousands who have not yet been rescued.
Nutritional Rehabilitation Homes.
At the Nepal Youth Foundation's Nutritional Rehabilitation Homes, children who are severely malnourished are restored to health while their parents are educated in child nutrition, hygiene and care. NYF funds and manages ten residential rehabilitation centers for extremely malnourished children, in Kathmandu and in rural areas of Nepal. The children and their mothers live at these centers for an average of five weeks. By the time they leave, the child is in good health and normal weight, and the parent is educated in child care, including preparation of nutritious meals using foods readily available in rural Nepal. NYF's field workers later follow up in the villages. The NRHs have rescued over 3,000 children. NYF intends to build a Nutritional Rehabilitation home in each of Nepal's 14 zones.
Scholarships.
The Nepal Youth Foundation provides scholarships for children who have no other way to attend school. The organization supports thousands of youngsters from kindergarten through medical school. These students attend private and government schools in the city of Kathmandu and in rural villages that are often more than a day’s walk from any road. NYF also trains teachers and builds and improves schools.
Children's Homes.
The Nepal Youth Foundation operates two homes for approximately 40 children: J House (for boys) and K house (for girls). These children are orphans, were abandoned by their parents, or are disabled. NYF provides them with personal attention, as well as education and medical expenses. NYOF commits to provide for these children through college. Most of the children are sponsored by donors in Western countries.

Merzbow

, better known by his stage name , is a Japanese noise musician. Since 1979, he has released over 350 recordings.
The name "Merzbow" comes from German artist Kurt Schwitters' artwork, "Merzbau". This was chosen to reflect Akita's dada influence and junk art aesthetic. In addition to this, Akita has cited a wide range of influences from progressive rock, free jazz, modern classical and "musique concrète" to BDSM and Japanese bondage. More recently, he has been inspired by animals, animal rights, and environmentalism.
As well as being a prolific musician, he has been a writer and editor for several books and magazines in Japan, and has written 17 books of his own. He has written about a variety of subjects, mostly about art, avant-garde, and post-modern culture. His more renowned works have been on the topics of BDSM and fetish culture. Other art forms Akita has been interested in include painting, photography, filmmaking, and Butoh dance. 
In 2000, Extreme Records released the 50-CD box set known as the "Merzbox". Akita's work has been the subject of several remix albums and at least one tribute album. This, among other achievements, has helped Merzbow to be regarded by some as the "most important artist in noise".
Life and career.
Early life.
Masami Akita was born in Tokyo in 1956. He listened to psychedelic music, progressive rock, and later free jazz in his youth, all of which have influenced his noise. In high school he became the drummer of various high school bands, which he left due to the other members being "grass-smoking Zappa freaks". By this time, he and high school friend Kiyoshi Mizutani had started playing improvised rock at studio sessions which Akita describes as "long jam sessions along the lines of Ash Ra Tempel or Can but we didn't have any psychedelic taste".
He later attended Tamagawa University to study fine art, at which he majored in painting and art theory. While at university, he became interested in the ideas of Dada and surrealism and also studied Butoh dance. At Tamagawa, he learned of Kurt Schwitters' "Merz", or art made from rubbish, including Schwitters' "Merzbau" ("Merz building"), which is the source of the name "Merzbow".
Lowest Music & Arts (1979–1984).
Merzbow began as the duo of Masami Akita and Kiyoshi Mizutani, who met Akita in high school. Akita started releasing noise recordings on cassettes through his own record label, Lowest Music & Arts, which was founded in order to trade cassette tapes with other underground artists. The earliest recording he made was "Metal Acoustic Music". Various other early releases included "Remblandt Assemblage" and "Solonoise 1". The "Collection" series consisted of ten cassettes, the first five were recorded in a studio for an independent label called Ylem, which went defunct before they could be released. So, Akita released them himself, and recorded five more at home.
Akita's earliest music was made with tape loops and creatively recorded percussion and metal. 
Early methods included what he referred to as "material action", in which he would closely amplify small sounds so as to distort them through the microphone. This method was used on "Material Action for 2 Microphones" and "Material Action 2 N.A.M.". Among early releases like the box set "Pornoise/1kg", Merzbow created artwork using photocopies of collages made out of manga and porn magazines he found in trash cans in the Tokyo subway. Akita explained this as trying to "create the same feeling as the secret porn customer for the people buying my cassettes in the early 80s". In 1984, he founded a second record label called ZSF Produkt.
ZSF Produkt (1984–1989).
ZSF Produkt (pronounced Zusufu, from an ancient Japanese word meaning "magnetic") was founded in 1984 to release music by similar artists within the industrial movement but eventually became the successor to Lowest Music & Arts. Numerous Merzbow releases were recorded at ZSF Produkt Studio, Masami Akita's home studio.
During this era, Merzbow found much wider recognition and began making recordings for various international labels. He also started touring abroad with the help of various collaborators. Merzbow performed in the USSR in 1988, toured the USA in 1990, Korea in 1991, and Europe in 1989 and 1992. Kiyoshi Mizutani left Merzbow after the 1989 European tour and continues to pursue a solo career.
Digital era (1989–1999).
During the European tour in September–October 1989, Merzbow could only bring simple and portable gear; this led to the harsh noise style Merzbow became known for in the 90s. "Cloud Cock OO Grand" (1990) was the first example of this new style, Merzbow's first digital recording (on DAT), and the first recording made for the CD format. It also includes live material recorded during the tour.
Recordings from the mid-1990s onwards are mostly of extreme volume, some mastered at levels far beyond standard ("Noisembryo", "Pulse Demon"). In 1994, Akita acquired a vintage EMS synthesizer. From 1996, plans were made to release a "10 (or maybe 12)" CD box set on Extreme Records. In 2000, Extreme Records released the "Merzbox", a fifty CD set of Merzbow records, twenty of them not previously released.
Throughout most of the 90s, Merzbow live was a trio including Reiko A. on electronics and Bara on voice and dance.
Laptop era (1999–2009).
Since 1999, Akita has used computers in his recordings, having first acquired a Macintosh to work on art for the "Merzbox". Also at this time he began referring to his home studio as "Bedroom, Tokyo". At live performances, Akita has produced noise music from either two laptop computers or combination of a laptop and analog synthesizers. Reiko A. and Bara left Merzbow during this time, Reiko Azuma now has a solo career. Since 2001, Jenny Akita (née Kawabata) started being credited for artwork on various releases.
Since 2001, Akita started utilising samples of animal sounds in various releases starting with "Frog". Around 2002, Akita became a vegan, he stated how it began:
During this period, Akita also became a supporter of PETA which is reflected in his animal-themed releases. An example of this is "Minazo Vol. 1" and "Vol. 2", dedicated to an elephant seal he visited often at the zoo and "Bloody Sea", a protest against Japanese whaling. He has also produced several works centered around recordings of his pet chickens (notably "Animal Magnetism" and "Turmeric").
Also in 2002, Akita released "Merzbeat", which was seen as a significant departure from his trademark abstract style in that it contains beat-oriented pieces. This has sparked some controversy among fans, though some reviewers pointed out that it sounded very similar to "Aqua Necromancer" (1998) which features samples of progressive rock drumming. "Merzbird" (2004) and "Merzbuddha" (2005) followed in a similar vein with sampled beats combined with Merzbow's signature harsh noise.
Current era (2009–present).
In 2009, Akita reintroduced the drum kit, his first instrument. This could be heard on "13 Japanese Birds", a thirteen disc series recorded and released one-a-month throughout 2009. At this time he changed the name of his home studio to Munemihouse.
Beginning in November 2009, Masami Akita started releasing archival material from the 1980s and 1990s, both reissues and previously unreleased material, several of which were released on cassette. The Blossoming Noise label has reissued five cassettes, and released "Microkosmos Volume 1", which is a new recording on LP with collage artwork created by Akita in 1982–83. The "Kibbutz" cassette was reissued on vinyl. Other cassettes of unreleased material include "Untitled Nov 1989", "9888A", "April 1992", and "Variations for Electric Fan". Merzbow has also released several archival boxes; "Merzbient", "Merzphysics", "Merzmorphosis", "Lowest Music & Arts 1980–1983", and "Duo".
Musical style.
Merzbow's sounds employ the use of distortion, feedback, and noises from synthesizers, machinery, and home-made noisemakers. While much of Merzbow's output is intensely harsh in character, Akita does occasionally make forays into ambient music. Vocals are employed sometimes, but never in a lyrical sense. Contrary to most harsh noise music, Akita also occasionally uses elements of melody and rhythm.
Akita's early work consisted of industrial noise music made from tape loops and conventional instruments. Similar to his present albums, he produced lengthy, disorienting pieces. He also became famous for the sheer volume of his releases. 
The avant-garde nature of Akita's work made acceptance by mainstream audiences difficult. When he performed with Kiyoshi Mizutani at the 1988 Jazz-on-Amur festival in the USSR, his improvised, experimental electroacoustic set was praised by fellow musicians as well as the festival's producer. The majority of the crowd, however, had been expecting a more traditional (and quieter) performance, and walked out. Prior to his second performance at the festival—which was to be made to an even more conservative audience— Akita was asked to play "more musically." On that first stage, Merzbow used the finest example of "classical analogue live noisemaiking technologies" to display: untuned guitar, a drumset, various micro-objects, small springs centered in its shell baffles, large aluminium boxes with strings inside to be attacked with a fiddlestick, etc. along with multi- piezo-pickuping and close-miking techniques, live processing through vintage US fuzz, ring modulator etc. boxes, and quite vivid and spontaneous approach, backed by slide and light shows. This live recording was re-processed and released as "Live in Khabarovsk, CCCP (I'm Proud by Rank of the Workers)" LP – and as the (once more re-mixed comparing to the LP) CD 26 of the Merzbox later on.
During the 90s Akita's work became much harsher and were generally mastered at a louder volume than usual. These were heavily influenced by death metal and grindcore bands of the time (a prime example is the "Venereology" album). The mid-90s saw Akita being heavily influenced by psychedelic bands and this was reflected in various albums.
Side projects.
In addition to Merzbow, Masami Akita has been involved in a number of side projects and groups.
Aliases.
Abtechtonics (or variations of this) was used by Akita for his artwork on Merzbow releases and his books.
House Hunt Hussies is credited for a track on the "Sexorama 1" compilation. ZSF Produkt listed as the contact address.
Pornoise was a mail art project Akita had in the 80s where he made collages using discarded magazines – in particular pornographic magazines – taken from the trash. These were then sent along with his cassettes, the idea being that his art was like cheap mail order pornography. "Pornoise/1kg" was released as part of these activities. Pornoise was credit as the artist for a track on the "Sexorama 2" compilation and co-credited for artwork on "Scissors for Cutting Merzbow".
Right Brain Audile is co-credited on the two "Music for Bondage Performance" albums, as they're soundtracks he did for several S&M and faux-Sepukku films produced by Kinbiken/Right Brain. RBA reappears on "Merzbient", which features recordings from this era.
SCUM was a project where Akita made new releases out of previous Merzbow sessions using cut-ups, effects, and mixing. SCUM is an acronym, standing for something different on each release, including "Society for Cutting Up Merzbow" (a reference to the "SCUM Manifesto"), "Scissors for CUtting Merzbow", "Steel CUM", etc.
Zecken was used for two solo synthesizer performances in 1996.
Groups.
Bustmonster was a "conceptual death metal" group (because they couldn't play death metal) with Tetsuo Sakaibara, Fumio Kosakai, Masahiko Ohno, Shohei Iwasaki, Maso Yamazaki and Zev Asher.
Flying Testicle was a trio with Yamazaki and Asher.
Merzbow Null was a collaboration between the groups of Merzbow and Null. In addition to Masami Akita and Kazuyuki Kishino, it featured several other members of both groups such as Reiko Azuma, Asami Hayashi, Kiyoshi Mizutani, Yushi Okano, Ikuo Taketani, etc. They did many improv performances during 1983–84 and released over a dozen cassettes.
Tibeta Ubik was a duo of Akita and Kishino active at the same time as Merzbow Null.
True Romance was a performance art project in the early 90s with Tetsuo Sakaibara (who became a live member of Merzbow) and Toshiyuki Seido. The performances included fetish equipment, simulated gore (including autopsy), mechanical devices, nude models, etc. It was inspired by Viennese Actionism. Masami Akita was a performer in addition to composing the backing music.
Other groups include: Boris with Merzbow; Commando Bruno Sanmartino with Incapacitants and Violent Onsen Geisha; Kikuri with Keiji Haino; Maldoror with Mike Patton; MAZK with Zbigniew Karkowski; Melting Lips with Hanayo; Muscats with Hanayo and Masaya Nakahara; Merz-Banana with Melt-Banana; Satanstornade with Russell Haswell (they later released an album entitled "Satanstornade" under their real names); Secrets with Tetsuya Mugishima (aka Seven); Shalon Kelly King with Fumio Kosakai.
Masami Akita played drums for Hijokaidan during the early–mid 90s.
Balázs Pándi has played drums for Merzbow at several concerts since 2009, and they released several albums.
Bibliography.
After completing his degree, Akita became a freelance writer and editor for various magazines in Japan. He frequently writes on a variety of topics such as sexuality (including pornography, S&M, and Japanese bondage. Excerpts appear in the "Music for Bondage Performance" album notes), underground and extreme culture (including music and art), architecture, and animal rights. None have been published in English.
Note: English title refers to English writing on the cover, sometimes it's a translation of the Japanese title, or a completely different phrase.

La Possibilité d'une île (film)

"La Possibilité d'une île" is a 2008 film directed by Michel Houellebecq, loosely based on his 2005 novel "The Possibility of an Island".
Plot.
Without much response and only accompanied by his not very supportive son Daniel and a technical assistant, a man calling himself 'The Prophet' travels around Belgium and lectures on eternal life and how it is possible to surpass the limitations of death. Only three years later he has achieved a remarkable status with numerous followers. Believing in the so-called Elohim, extraterrestrials who bring eternal life, the sect he founded is doing research on an optimised technique of cloning that allows one to reproduce an adult person within a few minutes including a copy of his complete memory storage. Daniel leaves his father's cult but returns years later in order to become The Prophet's successor. The story continues thousands of years from this moment. Daniel reappears as a clone of himself, heir to a long line of clones called neo-humans. Living in a cave, he reads about the past of humankind and his own ancestors. When an undefined longing urges him to leave his cave, he wanders a lonely world. After a dog has become his companion, Daniel feels like he approaches the concept of love which neo-humans have lost over the centuries. At the same time another loner is getting lost in the wastelands, a woman whose original human version once had an encounter, maybe a love affair with Daniel.

Stampede (video game)

Stampede is a video game cartridge which was released in 1981 for the Atari 2600 video game console, and the Intellivision video game console in 1982. The game is a left-to-right side-scroller with an overhead, third-person view. It was published by Activision.
Gameplay.
An Activision catalog from 1982 advertised "Stampede" in the following way:
The objective of "Stampede" is to round up all of the cattle you encounter. To do so, the player must lasso each one in order to capture it. The player is initially only allowed to let two cattle pass; if a third one slips by, the game is over. 
An important caveat to this is that the player gets one extra free pass for every 1,000 points scored. So, if a player were at 2,000 points and had not yet let any cattle pass, then he or she would be allowed to let four cattle pass before the fifth one ended the game (assuming he or she did not reach 3,000).
This makes it possible for an expert player to repeatedly beat the game—as after about 5,000 points or so the game essentially "resets," and the same pattern is repeated. According to David Yancey, there is a bug which makes it so that the game will typically only allow you to play in a loop for 8 play throughs; apparently, however, there is a version of the game with a different binary which allows one to continue to accrue points until the score 99,999 is reached.
Ports.
The Atari 2600 version of "Stampede" was made available on Microsoft's "Game Room" service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows-based PCs in May 2010.

ABC iview

ABC iview is a video on demand and Catch up TV service run by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The service became available on 24 July 2008. This was the next step after the podcasting of programmes since July 2006. Currently, this site is only viewable to users in Australia. The site streams video in 650kbit/s H.264 format. The iview website uses the RTMP protocol, and is thus officially accessible mainly on platforms supported by Adobe Flash, however the iPad, iPhone and internet connected TVs such as Sony and Samsung provide access through the use of native applications.
In November and December 2008 the iview player was updated to allow for unmetering by several Australian ISPs through a peering arrangement with Hostworks. The ISPs included Internode, iPrimus, Westnet, Apex Internet and Adam Internet. iiNet was able to offer iview unmetered without the peering upgrade. In addition, AARNet, Cinenet, and Comcen/SPIN since offer unmetered access to iview. The ABC News 24 live stream and content not streamed using Adobe Flash (i.e. through the iPad and Internet connected TVs) is currently not unmetered, however this may change in the future. 
Some shows may premiere on iview before they feature on broadcast television, such as "Rake".
Third-party access.
Offline viewing.
Unlike the ABC's podcasts, programs on the iview service are not officially downloadable and are only available to watch for a short time after the program has aired on the ABC. However, some individuals have been able to reverse-engineer the method that the Flash application uses to request videos from the media streaming servers to allow programs such as rtmpdump or flvstreamer to download the videos for offline playing or watch them in another RTMP-supporting client (such as XBMC).
In 2012 the ABC sent a legal notice to the author of an open source program called Python-iView which enabled users to download videos from the ABC.

The Path of the Mani is an ancient high-road from Kathmandu, Nepal, to the mountain pass of Langtan between the valleys of Nepal and the dry highlands of the Tibetan plateau. The pass is characterised by cairns and aligned stones and slabs at the sides often with a form of mandala or inscription on them. The path played an important role in trade between India, Nepal and Tibet where beasts of burden such as mules, yaks and donkeys would carry furs, hides, yak tails, borax, salt, musk and medicinal herbs for trading.

Miyamoto (crater)

Miyamoto is a crater lying situated within the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle (MC-19) region of the planet Mars, west of the Plains of Meridiani. The crater is wide. The crater's northeastern half is filled with rocks formed in the presence of water and include minerals of iron and sulfur, which likely settled on lake bottoms or in groundwater systems. In the southwestern half of the crater floor, erosion has stripped these materials away, instead revealing clays and other materials like those found in the most ancient Martian rocks. More than 3.5 billion years old, they date to the Noachian era at which time, liquid water was likely present at the surface and could have created an environment favorable to life.
Miyamoto was considered as a possible landing site for the Mars Science Laboratory.
Mars Science Laboratory.
Several sites in the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle have been proposed as areas to send NASA's next major Mars rover, the Mars Science Laboratory. Miyamoto Crater was in the top 7 sites chosen. Among the top 33 landing sites was Iani Chaos. Holden Crater is believed to have once been a lake. Eberswalde Crater contains a delta. There is a great deal of evidence that Miyamoto Crater once contained rivers and lakes. Many minerals, such as clays, chlorides, sulfates, and iron oxides, have been discovered there. Miyamoto Crater displays Inverted relief in the form of inverted channels. The picture below shows an inverted channel in Miyamoto. Inverted channels formed from accumulated sediments that were cemented by minerals. These channels eroded into the surface, then the whole area was covered over with sediments. When the sediments were later eroded away, the place where the river channel existed remained because the hardened material were resistant to erosion. 
In an article published in January 2010, a large group of scientists endorsed the idea of searching for life in Miyamoto Crater because of inverted stream channels and minerals that indicated the past presence of water.
The aim of the Mars Science Laboratory is to search for signs of ancient life. It is hoped that a later mission could then return samples from sites identified as probably containing remains of life. To safely bring the craft down, a 12 mile wide, smooth, flat circle is needed. Geologists hope to examine places where water once ponded. They would like to examine sediment layers.

<doc id="19403323" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19403323" title="Snowball (cockatoo)">
Snowball (cockatoo)

Snowball (hatched c. 1996) is a male Eleonora Cockatoo, noted as being the first non-human animal conclusively demonstrated to be capable of beat induction — perceiving music and synchronizing his body movements to the beat (i.e., dancing).
Background.
Snowball's abilities first became apparent after being acquired from a bird show at the age of six by his previous owner. He was observed bobbing his head in time to the Backstreet Boys song, Everybody (Backstreet's Back). The owner and his children encouraged this behavior and observed Snowball developing rhythmic foot-lifting gestures, perhaps in imitation of his human companions' arm-lifting gestures.
In August 2007, Snowball was relinquished by his previous owner (at least his third) to the Bird Lovers Only bird shelter of Schererville, Indiana after the cockatoo became "difficult to manage", following his daughter's departure to college. Shelter owner Irena Schulz was informed of the Cockatoo's unusual ability and, after confirming this behavior at first hand, uploaded a video of Snowball's dancing, swaying, and head bobbing to her website. Some time later the video was uploaded to YouTube. The video became something of an internet phenomenon, with over 200,000 views in one week and was featured on the television programs "Inside Edition" and "The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet".
Snowball has also appeared in TV commercials, advertising Loka brand bottled water in Sweden in 2008 and in a Taco Bell advert in 2009, dancing to Rupert Holmes' Escape (The Piña Colada Song).
Accomplishments.
In 2008, the YouTube clip featuring Snowball was brought to the attention of Drs. Aniruddh D. Patel and John R. Iversen of the Neurosciences Institute, La Jolla. In an interview with the New York Times, Dr. Patel stated that his 'jaw hit the floor' upon seeing the video, comparing the unlikely and contrary-to-accepted-wisdom nature of a cockatoo dancing to human music to that of a 'dog reading a newspaper out loud'.
Between January and May 2008, Patel led research to determine whether or not Snowball was, in fact truly synchronizing his body movements to the music (as opposed to simply mimicking or responding to visual clues from humans present in the room at the same time). Snowball's favorite piece of music was played to him at several different tempos and his reactions recorded on video for later analysis. The results, published in the paper ""Investigating the human-specificity of synchronization to music"" showed that Snowball was capable of spontaneously dancing to human music and also that he could adjust his movements to match the tempo of the music (albeit to a limited extent), a behavior previously thought only to occur in humans. This ability is believed to be unrelated to the male Eleonora Cockatoo's natural courtship display, which is described as "simple and brief" and involves strutting towards the female with crest raised, whilst bobbing and swishing his head in a figure-eight movement and "uttering soft, chattering notes all the while".
Adena Schachner and other scientists at Harvard University have also studied Snowball and reached conclusions which, broadly, endorse those of Dr. Patel. Schachner also identified that Alex, an African Grey Parrot famed for his intelligent use of language may have also shared the ability to 'dance', in addition to 33 other clips on YouTube showing animals moving in time to music. Patel has suggested that the capability of both humans and cockatoos to move synchronously to a rhythmic beat may be a "byproduct of a link between the auditory and motor parts of the brain" as a result of both species' ability to learn and mimic sounds.
In May 2009, Patel and Schulz announced the beginning of a new study, using the Billy Idol song, Dancing with Myself, which is intended to explore what role human interaction plays in Snowball's ability to dance.

<doc id="19403328" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19403328" title="Media prank">
Media prank

A media prank is a type of media event, perpetrated by staged speeches, activities, or press releases, designed to trick legitimate journalists into publishing erroneous or misleading articles. The term may also refer to such stories if planted by fake journalists, as well as the false story thereby published. A media prank is a form of culture jamming generally done as performance art or a practical joke for purposes of a humorous critique of mass media.
Notable instances.
In May 1927, Jean-Paul Sartre, who was known as one of the fiercest pranksters at the "École Normale Superieure" organized with his comrades Nizan, Larroutis, Baillou and Herland, a media prank following Charles Lindbergh's successful New York-Paris flight. Sartre & Co. called newspapers telling them that Lindbergh would be awarded an honorary degree by the "École". Many newspapers including "Le Petit Parisien" announced the event on May 25 and thousands showed up, unaware that they were witnessing a stunt with a look-alike. A scandal followed resulting in the resignation of the "École" director Gustave Lanson.
One well-known 1967 prank, orchestrated by Abbie Hoffman and Allen Ginsberg and chronicled in Norman Mailer's "Armies of the Night", involved a mock gathering protesting the Vietnam War (that many media took as a serious but misguided effort) intended to levitate the Pentagon.
Joey Skaggs is one of the most prolific creators of media pranks in the United States, often using actors to stage outlandish public events that are then covered by news media as real stories. Among his many pranks, he convinced United Press International to report that cockroach hormones had been identified as a cure for arthritis, and tricked WABC-TV in New York city to create a news segment (which was nominated for an Emmy Award despite being untrue) about a supposed "cathouse for dogs".
The band Negativland is (according to Time Magazine) "better known for media pranks than records". The band, as an excuse for cancelling an upcoming tour, issued a press release claiming that a teenager who had committed a multiple ax murder did so after arguing with his parents over the meaning of its song, Christianity Is Stupid. The story was picked up and reprinted as true by mass media, and the band wrote later songs about having perpetrated the hoax. In 2003 the band issued a series of press releases accusing Seattle, Washington radio station KJR-FM of playing 1980s music despite claiming it only played "the best of the 60s and 70s" then, after the radio station changed its format, issued more press releases announcing that it had all been a prank.
Beginning in 1999 with the fake campaign-oriented website gwbush.com, the Yes Men have impersonated famous celebrities, politicians, and business officials at appearances, interviews, websites, and other media to make political points.
In December, 2009 an Argentina news station fell victim to a media prank. Acting on a Facebook link, an investigative reporter believed that the latest trend in underage drinking was tied to a new cocktail mix called Grog XD. Unbeknown to the reporter, the 
recipe was from the video game The Secret of Monkey Island. 
Critique.
Although media pranks may serve as legitimate criticism of the press, and artistic creations in their own right, they are often criticized not only for the disruption they cause but as simple publicity stunts that take advantage of the very failures of mass media that they ostensibly oppose. Skaggs has criticized the Flash mob movement, as being frivolous and lacking the countercultural element of more serious protest art.

Jardin botanique de l'Université de Strasbourg

The Jardin Botanique de l'Université de Strasbourg (3.5 hectares), also known as the Jardin botanique de Strasbourg and the Jardin botanique de l'Université Louis Pasteur, is a botanical garden and arboretum located at 28 rue Goethe, Strasbourg, Bas-Rhin, Alsace, France. It is open daily without charge.
The garden was established in 1619 for the city's Académie (which in 1621 became the University) and is thus the second oldest botanical garden in France after that of Montpellier. It was created on the cemetery grounds of the convent Saint-Nicolas-aux-Ondes. This first site was then known as the Krutenau (plain of cabbage), and is now the Place de l'Ecole des Arts Decoratifs. This early garden was kept by the faculty of medicine. Its first inventory, published in 1670 by Marcus Mappus, listed some 1600 species. The entire university was suppressed in 1792 after the French Revolution, but the garden's director, Jean Hermann, managed to preserve not just the garden itself but also the statues of the Strasbourg Cathedral, which he buried within the garden.
In 1870 with the German army besieging Strasbourg, the garden again became an informal cemetery, and in 1871 the territory became a part of Germany. In 1880 Wilhelm II, German Emperor, began reconstruction of the Université Impériale as a scientific and cultural showcase, creating eight new institutes, the observatory and zoological museum, and today's botanical garden located on a new site, formerly the old city walls, under the leadership of botanist Heinrich Anton de Bary. The garden and its magnificent greenhouses were inaugurated in 1884.
In 1919 the garden reverted to French territory after World War I. Most of its greenhouses were destroyed by hail in 1958, and only the Bary Greenhouse, a work by Hermann Eggert, the architect of the Palais du Rhin, was saved from demolition in 1963. Newer greenhouses were built in 1967.
Today the garden contains about 15,000 specimens representing more than 6,000 species of plants, and is operated by the University of Strasbourg (formerly the Université Louis Pasteur). It consists of 9 plots surrounding the Institute of Botany: an arboretum, tropical greenhouse, cold greenhouse, the Bary Greenhouse, a greenhouse of grasses, a pond, the systematic garden, ecological plantings, and useful plants.

Ed Mahfouz

Ed Mahfouz (born February 5, 1950), is a politician in Ontario, Canada. A member of the Liberal Party of Canada, he ran for a seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the riding of Nepean—Carleton in the federal election of 2008. He lost the election, with 16,743 votes, 23.4% of the votes cast. The winner was the Conservative incumbent, Pierre Poilievre, with 55.8% of the vote.
A retired secondary school teacher who taught science and mathematics, he was also a professor who lectured at the Faculty of Education at the University of Ottawa. He also coached successful athletic teams at the secondary school level including soccer, badminton and basketball. He also co-owned the Steak & Caesar restaurant in western Ottawa. He is a published author and university graduate, earning a masters in Education from the University of Ottawa.
An October 8, 2008 editorial published in the Ottawa Citizen during he 2008 Canadian general election campaign was critical of Ed Mahfouz, describing him as "not qualified to be a member of Parliament. Nearly every question put to him receives the same stock answer, as though someone had pulled a cord in his back: 'That issue is very important to us ... I will raise your concern to the highest level in my party.'" The same editorial was also critical of his principal opponent, Poilievre, describing him as a politician who "consistently underestimates the intelligence of the people in his riding" and "tells them what he thinks they need to know." The editorial was notably complimentary towards Green Party candidate Gadzala and NDP candidate Phil Brown.
Mahfouz was a supporter of former Liberal leader Stéphane Dion’s “Green Shift”, a plan intended to cut income taxes, price carbon emissions, and fight poverty.

Wetherby services

Wetherby Services is a major service station north of Wetherby on the A1(M) in northern England. The service station fully opened in September 2008. The service station lies just inside North Yorkshire in the parish of Kirk Deighton (the actual town of Wetherby lying on the West Yorkshire side of the border line). The service station is situated on junction 46, the interchange between the A1(M) and the B1224. The service station is operated by Moto Hospitality.
The service station arrangement is single sided. Unlike older service stations which are situated on both sides of the motorway, each having their own amenities, or the amenities being concentrated on one side and a footbridge linking them, Wetherby is all on one site, access can be gained from both sides of the motorway via the flyovers of Junction 46 (A1(M)/ B1224 Sandbeck Approach/ Racecourse Approach Interchange).
The new service station uses the latest 'green technologies' in its construction and running, making it the UK's first carbon neutral service station. The service station will include a 126-bed Days Inn hotel, which will be the first major hotel in the north of the town. The service station will actually fall into North Yorkshire and so technically be under separate jurisdiction to Wetherby. The services opened (except for the hotel) in August 2008, with the hotel opening the following summer.
Facilities include a Marks and Spencer Simply Food (the second branch in Wetherby after the main one in the town centre), a Costa Coffee (also the second in Wetherby after the main one in the town centre), a WH Smiths, a Burger King and a BP filling station.
The roof of the BP filling station is the largest single span roof for a filling station in Europe.
This new service area has been built due to the re-alignment and upgrading of this section of the A1 to motorway standard, now bypassing several older service areas and petrol stations, the best known being the Selby Fork services.

<doc id="19403407" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19403407" title="Daniel 11">
Daniel 11

Daniel 11 is the eleventh chapter in the Book of Daniel. It describes a series of conflicts between the unnamed "King of the North" and "King of the South". The dream narrative begins in Chapter 10 and concludes in Chapter 12.
Composition.
The date of composition was first drawn by the philosopher Porphyry of Tyros, a 3rd-century pagan and Neoplatonist, whose fifteen-volume work "Against the Christians" is only known to us through Jerome's reply. The "identification" of Antiochus Epiphanes in Daniel, however, is a much older interpretation which seems to be reflected, for example, in 1 Maccabees 1:54 (c100 BC), where an idol of Zeus set up upon the altar of burnt offering under Antiochus is referred to as an "abomination of desolation" (cf. Dan. 9:27, 11:31). This identification is made explicit in Josephus' exposition of Daniel chapter eight ("Antiquities" 10:11, c94 AD) where he almost certainly cites a common Jewish interpretative tradition by identifying the "little horn" as Antiochus. According to British historian Bryan Rennie, the conclusion that the Book of Daniel was written at the time of the profanation of the Temple by Antiochus IV would explain why the author is not very precise about 6th century events, why he is so precise about the time of Antiochus, and why he was never counted among the prophets. Scholars are virtually unanimous in regarding the Book of Daniel as a message of encouragement to those people suffering for their faith (hasidim) under the oppression of Antiochus IV Epiphanes.
Narrative.
The narrative setting takes place during the third year of Cyrus king of Persia on the twenty-fourth day of the first month. The prophet Daniel was on the banks of the Tigris River. When he looked up, he saw the figure of a man standing before him dressed in white linen. Although his companions fled in terror, they saw nothing. Daniel faints and has a dream where the angel Gabriel speaks of conflicts between the King of North and King of the South.
"King of the North" and "King of the South".
Critical scholars have asserted that the prophecies in the Book of Daniel reflect the persecutions of the Jews by the Greek Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes who ruled the Jews from 175–164 BC, and his desecration of the altar in the temple at Jerusalem, and consequently they date its composition to that period. In particular, the vision in Chapter 11, which focuses on a series of wars between the "King of the North" and the "King of the South", is generally interpreted as a record of Levantine history from the time of Alexander the Great down to the era of Antiochus IV, with the "Kings of the North" being the Seleucid kings of Syria and the "Kings of the South" being the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt.
In Hebrew numerology, the name Nebuchadnezzar contains a veiled reference to Antiochus Epiphanes sharing a numerical value in Gematria. Nebuchadnezzar's name in cuneiform is "Nabû-kudurri-uṣur" which is transliterated into Hebrew as "נבוכדנאצר" or "Nebuwkadne'tstsar"(as in Jeremiah 46:2; 39:11). When the numbers represented by ""Nebuwkadne'tstsar"" are added up, the result is (423) the same exact value for the numbers in the name "Antiochus Epiphanes".
Historicity.
The Hellenistic period of Jewish history began in 332 BCE when Alexander the Great defeated the last Persian king Darius III and conquered Persia. Upon his death in 323 BCE, his empire was divided among his generals("Diadochi"). The entire region of Judea was heavily contested between the successor states of Alexander's empire, the satrapies of the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Egypt, during the six Syrian Wars of the 3rd-1st centuries BCE: "After two centuries of peace under the Persians, the Hebrew state found itself once more caught in the middle of power struggles between two great empires: the Seleucid state with its capital in Syria to the north and the Ptolemaic state, with its capital in Egypt to the south...Between 319 and 302 BCE, Jerusalem changed hands seven times."
Interpretations.
In Christian historicism, "Daniel's vision" has been linked to events that occurred in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC concerning the struggle between the Ptolemies ("the king of the south", cf ) and the Seleucids ("the king of the north") for the control of Judea, in which the Seleucids were eventually victorious. is devoted to the Seleucid king Antiochus Epiphanes(the ruler of the Jews from 175-164 BCE), his rise to power, wars against Egypt, and his subsequent actions against Jerusalem, the Temple and the Jewish people. is considered very accurate. All major conflicts are mentioned, and the Sixth Syrian War is described in great detail.
In Evangelicalism, the interpretation of the "king" mentioned in Daniel 11:36-45 is not the "King of the North", but a fourth king who is identified as the Antichrist. This one engages in the military conquests of verses 40-45 where he targets the land of Israel[v.41] The time of this attack is stated to be in the "end time". Some Evangelicals place this event during the first half of the Great Tribulation. They also link the identity of the kings to Isaiah 19:24, 25, which mentions Egypt and Syria (Assyria). Daniel 11:45 explains that after doing battle with Syria, the King of the North will return to Israel to establish his royal palace at "the beautiful Holy Mountain". This is interpreted to mean that the Antichrist will establish his headquarters on the Temple Mount.

New to this version are 60 new levels, 60 additional challenges, the introduction of the new Peggle Master Marina the Electric Squid, and the addition of an "Aced" score for each level. As of January 2010, three expansions have been released: a holiday theme, a spring theme and a pack with fan-art-based levels. Both come with extra adventure levels and challenges.
The Xbox Live Arcade version of "Peggle" received "Nights" content in the form of a downloadable expansion for the game on November 18, 2009, at a cost of $4.99.
The iPhone version of "Peggle" received "Nights" content as an In-App Purchase on October 4, 2010, for the cost of $.99.

South Vietnamese decorations for United States Service Members

South Vietnamese decorations, also known as awards of the Republic of Vietnam, were first issued to United States service members beginning around 1964. Over the next three years, the awards were mainly confined to the senior leadership of the United States Military Assistance Command, but by 1967, the large presence of U.S. troops in Vietnam led to a common practice of awarding Vietnamese decorations to U.S. soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen.
Throughout the Vietnam War, the Military Merit Medal was awarded solely to enlisted U.S. service members who had been killed in action, while the National Order and Distinguished Service Order were awarded only to senior U.S. military personnel. By far the most common Vietnamese decorations awarded to U.S. troops were the Vietnam Campaign Medal and the Gallantry Cross Unit Citation; the Campaign Medal was awarded for six months of service in Vietnam while the Gallantry Cross unit citation was almost automatic for U.S. Army personnel and quite common in other service branches as well. In 1974, a General Order of the U.S. Army made the Gallantry Cross Unit Citation automatic for any soldier who had spent any amount of time in Vietnam; this has led to this decoration being arguably the most commonly awarded foreign decoration of all time.
The Civil Actions Medal and unit citation were also commonly awarded to members of the United States Marine Corps making this a very common decoration seen on U.S. Marine Corps uniforms. The remainder of Vietnamese medals, such as the Air and Navy Gallantry Cross and the Staff and Special Service Medals, were awarded with different frequency between the U.S. service branches and amongst officer/enlisted personnel.
In the 21st century United States military, the Vietnam Campaign Medal, the Gallantry Cross, and the Gallantry Cross/Civil Action/Presidential unit citations are still authorized for wear on U.S. uniforms and many senior officers today, who began their careers in Vietnam, can be seen wearing such medals. However, since the nation of South Vietnam no longer exists, these medals and ribbons must be privately purchased and there are no channels for the retroactive award of said medals, except in the case of the Vietnam Campaign Medal and the Gallantry Cross Unit Citation which are considered automatic decorations and can be added to a DD Form 214 by request through the military service branch or through NPRC in St. Louis, Missouri.

German decorations awarded to members of the United States military

German decorations awarded to members of the United States military have held an interesting "love–hate relationship" with the United States military beginning as far back as the American Revolution when various mercenary soldiers from Europe, who had served in the military forces of the German kingdoms, joined the Colonial forces and displayed, with various degrees of standardization, German medals on American uniforms.
During the American Civil War a similar situation developed with some soldiers, on both sides of the conflict, holding prior service in European conflicts and thus having been decorated with various German military decorations. Both during the Civil War and the American Revolution, there was no effort to formulate any sort of regulations regarding the wear of foreign medals on USA (and CSA) uniforms with those soldiers who felt they were entitled to such medals simply displaying them as a matter of course.
By the time of the First World War, German decorations had faded from the military memory of the United States and, during the actual conflict where Germany and America were on opposing sides, any award of a German decoration to an American soldier would have been unheard of.
By 1938, the only authorization of a Nazi decoration occurred in the U.S. military when the Order of the German Eagle was authorized for presentation (but not general wear) to some American service members who had been stationed in Germany at various diplomatic posts. Charles Lindbergh was one of the most notable recipients of this decoration.
During World War II, Nazi decorations became awards of the enemy and therefore there was no thought of their display on American uniforms. Even so, cases were reported in POW camps of some American military members, who had been sentenced to forced labor receiving the War Merit Medal for "high production" or performing above the standards expected of an enemy prisoner. There are no records, however, of an American willingly accepting a Nazi decoration nor did the United States military ever authorize a Nazi award to be displayed on a U.S. uniform.
By the 1960s, the government of West Germany had begun presenting medals to senior U.S. military leaders stationed in Germany as part of the NATO defense plan against the Warsaw Pact. By the 1980s and the 1990s, firmer regulations had allowed by the awarding of German awards to enlisted personnel, with marksmanship and sports badges topping the list. This practice continued after German reunification and into the present day.

was last awarded to a US officer in 2003 and is today rarely awarded to only very senior US officers. Most of those were to the SACEUR usually as "end-of-tour" decorations. The German Proficiency and Marksmanship Badges are far more commonly awarded, mainly to U.S. Army and Air Force personnel.

Mill Creek Wind Farm is a proposed wind farm in the Ohariu Valley near Wellington, New Zealand. 
The wind farm is being developed by Meridian Energy. The application for resource consents described the project as having a total capacity of up to 71.3MW. The wind farm would cover an area of approximately 18 km² and use 31 Siemens 2.3MW wind turbines. 
The resource consents were granted in February 2009 with conditions, including a limit of 29 turbines and a maximum height of 111m. Local Ohariu Valley residents who opposed the development lodged an appeal to the Environment Court.
In August 2011, the Environment Court approved the resource consents for the project, subject to a limit of 26 turbines.
In June 2012, Meridian Energy confirmed that construction would start in the next few months with completion expected in mid-2014.
By early January 2013, Meridian had about 75 full-time workers on the site and work had started on a new access road from Porirua and on upgrading the existing roads near the wind farm.

Guyanese people

Guyanese people are people originating in the South American nation of Guyana. Geographically Guyana is not an island in the Caribbean but a nearby mainland land mass full with the English Caribbean through history and culture first as a Dutch, then British colony, and as a founding member of CARICOM. The culture of Guyana is described as Caribbean or "West Indian", as it is much more similar to the culture of the "West Indian" Caribbean islands such as Trinidad, Barbados, St. Vincent, Grenada, rather than the other South American countries. Like other Caribbean countries Guyanese culture shares some customs and traits with other Latin American countries.
Demographics.
Guyana is a diverse nation, 43.5% of the population is of East Indian origin (Biharis, Tamils, Telugus, Punjabis) 31.2% Black African (see Afro-Guyanese), 16.7% multiracial (almost all part African), 9.2% Amerindian and 0.46% other, mostly Chinese and whites (most notably Portuguese and English). Some Guyanese have heritage from Afghanistan, Persia, Mesopotamia, Spain, and Syria. English (in the form of Guyanese Creole) is the most common language amongst Guyanese people in Guyana and its diaspora. The religious breakdown of Guyanese people is: Hindu 28.4%, Pentecostal 16.9%, Roman Catholic 8.1%, Muslim 7.2%, Anglican 6.9%,
Seventh-day Adventist 5%, other Christian denominations 20.5%, no religion 4.3%, Rastafarian 0.5%, Bahá'í 0.1%, other faiths 2.2%.
Diaspora.
Overseas Guyanese communities mainly exist in the United States (86,120 Guyanese born), United Kingdom (20,872 Guyanese born), Canada (14,560 Guyanese born), and the Netherlands (328 Guyanese born), although the total populations (i.e. including people of Guyanese descent born in that country) are much higher. 
The reason for this mass exodus were the highly oppressive policies of Forbes Burnham, former president and dictator* who was widely regarded as a rigger of elections.
The migration of Guyanese to other countries began in the late 1950s when some Guyanese (mainly young men, and some women) took up offers from the British Government to migrate to England to supplement the British labour force, like other Caribbean countries. This was a short lived policy as the British government quickly closed the doors on open immigration from its Caribbean Territories. The migration of many Guyanese Portuguese to the U.K and Canada happened in the late 1960s and early 1970s due to political struggles or "perceptions" of political problems at the time. 
The Migration of Guyanese to other Western countries mostly Canada and the United States continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s, much of it due to political and economic problems. The Forbes Burnham government continuously doctored elections through the 1970s in his favour, and was feared by many for his Stalinist behavior. The 1980s saw mass migration due to continuing misguided economic policies and problems, continuous shortages of basic items on a daily basis, and a country run much the way Cuba is perceived today. While many left due to political, economic, and social problems, those who could afford left looking for better opportunities and some for educational purposes. The 1990s saw migration to other Caribbean countries. Migration continued by the need to reconnect split families. The migration of Guyanese to other lands continues even today.

Cher Doll Records

Cher Doll Records is a small independent record label founded in Seattle, Washington by Nancy Ostrander in 1993. The label released records for several indie-pop bands including Neutral Milk Hotel's first single on a two sided seven-inch record.
History.
Founder Nancy Ostrander was inspired to start Cher Doll by the fanzine and record label Four Letter Words, one of the earliest of the American indiepop labels started up in response to the C86 and twee movements in the UK. Cher Doll started out as a seven-inch singles-only label associated with Ostrander's "Hip Clown Rag" fanzine. 
In 1992 Cher Doll released Crayon's "The Dream is Gone" and Veronica Lake's "Sleepyhouse" on a split 7-inch record, as well as Crayon's 1994 Phantom Third Channel split 7-inch EP. The label also recorded for Blanket, a Seattle band inspired by Spacemen 3 and the Velvet Underground whose members went on to play in Sno*Boy and Tullycraft.
In 1994, at that time living in Seattle, Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel sent a tape of material recorded on a four-track to Ostrander, who found the music and Mangum intriguing: "It was fuzzy and happy and catchier than heck. I like music that is actual songs—the shorter the better—and he got bonus points for "Snow Song" sounding like the Jesus and Mary Chain." She selected two songs and released the group's first single "Everything Is"/"Snow Song Pt. 1". Mangum said, "The single was a Godsend because I was pretty much at the end of my rope with just about everything in my life at that point. I'd moved away from my home and all my friends for the first time and I was very much alone and sad ... she saved me merely by saying she wanted to do a single." 
In 1994, Cher Doll also released Neutral Milk Hotel's "Up and Over" on the compilation 7" EP "The Amazing Phantom Third Channel"; Mangum wrote it to resolve his fear and confusion. The band's "Invent Yourself a Shortcake", released by Cher Doll on the compilation EP, "Champagne Dancing Party", in 1995, included Will Cullen and Bill Doss. The band released several more seven-inch singles with Cher Doll while Mangum lived in Seattle. Mangum said he was not pleased with a 7" record, "Bucket", on Cher Doll, because the recording made in a studio "doesn't sound like me."
Cher Doll Records cooperated on projects with "like-minded" Darla Records, founded in 1994 and producing "bright, sugary pop albums". Cher Doll issued two full-length albums, distributed by Darla Records.
Alistair Fitchett, reviewed the "Something Cool" compilation released by Cher Doll in 1997 as "a winner for sure", having heard from "indeipopsters that matter in the USA, it's a hit hit HIT". He said:
In 1998, Cher Doll Records released Tullycraft's second full length album, "City of Subarus", recorded by Chris Munford, who had joined the group from Incredible Force of Junior.

Poole Park

Poole Park is an urban park adjacent to Poole Harbour in Poole, Dorset, England. The park was opened during the Victorian era and has remained popular with visitors ever since. It is open all year round and hosts a number of events.
History.
The park was constructed on land donated by Lord Wimborne and was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1890. The park was built on former meadows and marshes by the town centre adjacent to Poole Harbour and covers an area of , of which include the park's large man-made lake and ponds. Poole Park Zoo was operated from June 1963 until it fell out of favour in February 1994. Although small, at one time it boasted a Himalayan Black Bear. The park was designated a Conservation Area in 1995, and in 2007 a £2 million project was undertaken to dredge the lake and create five small islands and two raised reed beds. The project also involved the construction of a new restaurant and an indoor ice rink for children.
Attractions.
Facilities include two children's play areas, tennis courts, a bowling green, miniature golf and a ridable miniature railway. A cricket field and pavilion inside the park are home to Poole Town Cricket Club and water sport activities such as sailing, windsurfing, kayaking and rowing take place on the lake.The boating lake is around 21 hectares in size and between 1 and 1.5 meters deep. The lake can only be emptyed or filled during spring tides via sluices to the harbour, it is also filled via the local surface water drainage system meaning that the water is brackish (mixture of salt and freshwater)
Every Saturday morning a free 5 km parkrun is held at 9:00 am starting near the cricket pavilion. The run is open to everyone but runners are required to register online before taking part. Poole parkrun started on 2 April 2011 with 65 runners. On the 11th January 2014 Poole parkrun set a new attendance record of 601 runners.
Poole parkrun regularly hosts over 475 runners each week.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Malaysia)

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Malaysia () is the Malaysian government ministry which oversees the foreign relations of Malaysia. The current ministry is based in Putrajaya with Datuk Seri Anifah Aman as Minister, Datuk Hamzah Zainuddin as the Deputy Minister. The ministry has its own building called Wisma Putra.
Functions.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for managing bilateral, regional and multilateral relations with foreign countries and international organisations. It is responsible for the formulation, planning, and implementation of the foreign policy of Malaysia. It is also responsible for managing external relations with regard to bilateral political and economic affairs, multilateral relations, ASEAN regional cooperation, human resources management, finance, administration and consular, protocol affairs and Malaysian mission abroad.
History.
The origin of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs began before Malaysia's independence in 1957. The groundwork for the establishment of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), as it was initially called, was initiated a year prior to Independence particularly with through the training of a batch of eleven diplomats to man the country's diplomatic missions overseas. This pioneering group was trained in the United Kingdom and Australia.
The Ministry of External Affairs was modeled after the British Foreign Office. 
Initially, Malaysia had diplomatic missions in London, Washington, Canberra, New York, New Delhi, Jakarta and Bangkok. In 1963, there were fourteen Malaysian missions and twenty-five countries were represented in Malaysia (four by way of concurrent accreditation).
In 1965, the diplomatic machinery of Malaysia faced its first major reorganization. In 1966, there was an accelerated growth pattern of the Foreign Ministry particularly with regard to the personnel and the financial allocation for its activities. That year also witnessed a change in the designation of MEA to the preferred terminology of "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" and also saw the physical relocation and consolidation of the Ministry. From its original premises at the Sultan Abdul Samad Building, the Ministry moved to Wisma Putra. The Wisma Putra Complex is based on a combination of both traditional and modern architecture.

EasyPeasy (formerly named Ubuntu Eee) is a Linux-based operating system for netbooks. EasyPeasy is built upon Debian and Ubuntu, but is customized for low-powered computers and access to web applications. EasyPeasy is maintained as an open source project, though it does use popular web applications or proprietary software over free and open source software alternatives (e.g. Skype over Ekiga) when the functionality offered is deemed better by its users.
History.
Ubuntu Eee was started by Jon Ramvi in December 2007. At that time it was only some scripts which modified a regular Ubuntu installation to support the Asus Eee PCs. In June 2008 the project was disbanded as a script and Ubuntu Eee 8.04 was released as a stand-alone distribution, based on Ubuntu 8.04 with EeePC support installed out of the box. On September 5 followed the 8.04.1 version. It used a new Linux kernel, came with a new user interface and Flash 10.

United States Air Force In South Korea

The United States Air Force In South Korea is composed of units assigned to Pacific Air Forces Seventh Air Force. The mission of the personnel, equipment and aircraft is to deter, protect and defend the Republic of Korea from attack from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) or more commonly known as North Korea.
Overview.
The mission of Seventh Air Force is to plan, direct, and conduct combined air operations in the Republic of Korea and in the Northwest Pacific in support of PACAF, the United States Pacific Command, United Nations Command, US-ROK Combined Forces Command, and US Forces Korea.
Currently, Seventh Air Force provides command and control to two Wings based permanently in South Korea:
History.
The first American Air Force unit assigned to Korea was the World War II 308th Bombardment Wing, assigned to Far East Air Forces. The wing and its assigned 475th Fighter Group was ordered to Seoul on 22 September 1945 as part of the United States Army Military Government in Korea to de-militarize the Japanese forces in the Korean peninsula. In addition, the wing was to evacuate Allied prisoners of war and civilian internees; to maintain air supremacy in the occupation area; to provide air protection for Allied naval forces, provide Air/Sea rescue for waters off the Korean peninsula; obtain photographic reconnaissance for the United States Army XXIV Corps in Korea, and perform special operations for ground and naval forces. Also the 308th Bomb Wing established and operated RADAR facilities. The wing was reassigned to Kimpo on 7 January 1946, and remained in Korea until March 1947 when it was reassigned to Nagoya, Japan.
On 27 June 1950 the United Nations Security Council voted to assist the government of South Korea in resisting the invasion of their country by the armed forces of North Korea that began on 25 June. United States President Harry Truman authorized General Douglas MacArthur (commander of the US occupying forces in Japan) to commit units to the battle. MacArthur ordered General George E. Stratemeyer, Commander in Chief of Far East Air Force (FEAF) based in Japan to attack invading North Korean forces between the front lines and the 38th parallel.
That day, two Japan-based USAF F-82 Twin Mustangs destroyed three North Korean Air Force planes over Seoul as a C-54 Skymaster was attempting to evacuate U.S. civilians, including many women and children, from the advancing North Korean Army in the opening days of the Korean War.
The United States Air Force has maintained a presence in South Korea ever since.
Korean War.
  for information concerning aircraft flown by FEAF in the Korean War; bases, and units engaged in combat operations.
South Korea fell within the USAF Far East Air Forces (FEAF) Area of Responsibility (AOR), and Far East Air Force units responded quickly and effectively in the first critical week of the war, proving in many ways the utility of air power in modern war.
FEAF's Fifth Air Force was the main United Nations combat air command. Logistics and transport units were assigned to Far East Air Forces Combat Cargo Command, and on 8 July a special FEAF Bomber Command was set up under the command of Major General Emmett O'Donnell.
Initial USAF Response.
Initial FEAF missions were the transportation of Army and Marine units and equipment from Japan to South Korea, the evacuation of American civilian nationals, and obtaining significant intelligence through aerial reconnaissance of North Korean troop movements south. Fighter-bomber ground attack missions by Japan based F-80Cs significantly slowed the North Korean Army's advance during July 1950. On 13 July, the FEAF Bomber Command took over command of the 19th Bombardment Group and of the 22nd and 92nd Bombardment Groups which had been transferred from Strategic Air Command (SAC) bases in the United States to Japan. These B-29 Superfortress units were used in tactical attacks which were not very successful.
Despite repeated air attacks by UN aircraft on the advancing North Korean troops, by early September the UN armies had been squeezed down into a small area south of the Naktong River, called the "Pusan Perimeter", and there was a very real fear that the hard-pressed UN troops might be forced to evacuate the entire Korean peninsula. In late July, MacArthur agreed to divert the B-29s to interdiction raids against North Korean targets nearer the 38th parallel in an attempt to interrupt supplies being delivered to North Korean troops in the south.
Later in July, the SAC 98th and 307th Bombardment Groups were also sent to Japan to join the FEAF. The 31st Strategic Reconnaissance Group completed the team. The 92nd and 98th BGs and the 31st SRG operated from bases in Japan, whereas the 19th, 22nd, and 307th BGs were based in Okinawa. Five major industrial centers in North Korea were earmarked for attack. This sort of mission is what the B-29 had been designed for, and by early September, all known industrial facilities in North Korea had been destroyed except for some oil storage facilities at Rashin, which was considered too close to the Soviet border to risk an attack. By late September, all 18 strategic targets in North Korea had been destroyed, and the B-29 Force now turned to secondary targets.
Along with the SAC B-29 units, Tactical Air Command (TAC) deployed numerous fighter, fighter-bomber, tactical bomber, transport and support units to FEAF. TAC Lockheed F-80C Shooting Star and Republic F-84E Thunderjets units deployed to FEAF to rapidly gain control of the air from the Korean People's Armed Forces Air Corps (KPAFAC). For a time in August and September 1950, all FEAF flying units had to fly from bases in Japan. The only continuously usable tactical base in Korea was Taegu (K-2), which the FEAF used as a staging field to refuel and arm tactical aircraft.
North Korea was equipped with an assortment of Russian-built equipment such as the Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-11 fighters, the Ilyushin Il-10 ground attack aircraft and a smattering of Yak-18 and Polikarpov Po-2 trainers. Having largely eliminated the KPAFAC, the FEAF now turned to the task of ground attack in trying to halt the rapid North Korean advance. By September, the North Korean aircraft had largely been swept from the sky.
By August 1950, in order to build up close support forces, 145 North American F-51D Mustangs were shipped from the United States aboard the aircraft carrier USS Boxer (CV-21). These planes were quickly assembled and flown out to combat units. The 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing gave up its F-80 Shooting Star jets for Mustangs, perhaps one of the few occasions in history in which a combat outfit traded in its jets for piston-engined aircraft. The Mustangs were instrumental in halting the North Korean advance, giving United Nations forces enough time to build up sufficient strength to be able to go over onto the offensive.
With both American strategic and tactical air power arriving in force, F-80 Shooting Stars and F-51 Mustangs closed most rail and road traffic by day, and destroyed 32 critical bridges necessary for the conduct of warfare. Trains used by military and civilians alike waited out the daylight hours in tunnels.
Throughout all parts of Korea, B-29 Superfortresses knocked out the main supply dumps and eliminated oil refineries and seaports that handled imports. The bombing was designed to starve North Korean forces of ammunition and other martial supplies. On 16 September as part of a strategic bombing campaign, the FEAF bombed Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, and Wonsan, an east coast port 80 miles north of the 38th parallel. Naval air power also attacked transportation choke points. The North Korean forces were already strung out over the peninsula, and the destruction caused by American bombers prevented needed supplies from reaching North Korean forces in the south.
With control of the air obtained, General MacArthur's invasion of Inchon on 15 September 1950 suddenly reversed the fortunes of the UN forces in Korea. In the south, the Eighth U.S. Army, made up of U.S., ROK, and British forces, counterattacked the next day and United Nations forces in the Pusan Perimeter began to push north rapidly.
U.S. Marines attached to X Corps captured Kimpo Air Base near Seoul on 17 September. Two days later the first FEAF cargo carrier landed there, inaugurating an around-the-clock airlift of supplies, fuel, and troops. C-54 Skymasters returned wounded personnel to hospitals in Japan, and C-119s airdropped supplies to front-line forces. Bad weather hindered close air support of the Eighth Army, but on the 26th the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division forged out of the Pusan Perimeter north of Taegu and within a day thrust northward to link up with 7th Infantry Division forces near Osan, 25 miles south of Seoul. Air controllers, using tactics similar to those developed in France during World War II, accompanied the advancing tank columns, supported tank commanders with aerial reconnaissance, and called in close air support missions as needed. On 26 September, General Douglas MacArthur announced the recapture of Seoul, but street fighting continued for several more days.
As US forces swept North Korean troops from South Korea, aviation engineers rebuilt the airfields, beginning with Pohang, on the east coast 50 miles northeast of Taegu. USAF flying units returned on 7 October to Pohang and to other rebuilt airfields at Kimpo, near Seoul, and at Suwon, 20 miles south of Seoul. By the end of the month North Korean forces had been driven entirely out of South Korea.
United Nations Offensive 1950.
For the United Nations forces, victory was in the air by early October 1950. The Inchon landing and the breakout from the Pusan Perimeter had destroyed the North Korean units operating south of the 38th Parallel. With the return of Seoul to the South Korean government, the Republic of Korea regained the status it had enjoyed before the 25 June invasion. To stop at this juncture would have been consistent with America’s policy of containment.
With the North Korean forces largely removed from the South, the United Nations decided to enforce its prewar intention of reuniting all of Korea under one government, and UN forces advanced across the 38th parallel and into North Korea in early October 1950. However, the decision to cross the 38th Parallel appears, in retrospect, to have been the turning point in the Korean War.
On 1 October Chinese Premier Chou En-lai warned that China would not tolerate or stand aside if UN forces invaded North Korea. This was a clear threat that China would intervene if that should happen. On the second the Soviet delegate to the United Nations proposed that a ceasefire in Korea be called and that all foreign troops be withdrawn. On 2 October, India warned the United Nations that China told them it would enter the war if U.N. forces cross the 38th Parallel. However, despite these warnings from China, The U.S. Army X Corps made amphibious landings at Wonsan and Iwon, which had already been captured by South Korean forces advancing by land.
Many in the West, including General MacArthur, thought that taking the war into Northern China would be necessary since North Korean troops were being supplied by bases in Manchuria. MacArthur believed that Chinese supply depots near Mukden (now Shenyang) in southern Manchuria and railroad lines leading across the Yalu River into North Korea should be bombed by USAF B-29s. However, President Truman and his senior advisers disagreed, ordering MacArthur to be very cautious when his ground forces approached the Manchurian border along the Yalu.
The UN offensive greatly concerned the Chinese, who worried that the UN forces would not stop at the Yalu River, the border between North Korea and the People's Republic of China, and might extend their rollback policy into China. By the end of October, UN forces were up near the Chinese frontier and some forward units were actually on the southern banks of the Yalu River. On 1 November 1950, a group of F-51s and B-26s were attacking Sinuiju airfield (just across the Yalu from China) when they encountered six swept-wing jets coming across the Yalu at them, firing as they approached. The Mustangs were able to escape the attack and return to base to report that the Soviet MiG-15 had appeared in Korea.
Chinese Intervention 1950.
When the Soviet-built Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 (MiG-15) first appeared over the skies of Korea, its performance was vastly superior to every United Nations aircraft then in use in the theater. The MiG-15 was equal to the F-86A. It was a better dogfighter, with an edge in maneuverability and excellent acceleration. Its top speed, however, was slightly less than that of the F-86.
In order to counter the MiG threat, on 8 November the 4th Fighter Interceptor Wing (which consisted of the 334th 335th, and 336th Squadrons) based at Wilmington, Delaware and equipped with the F-86A Sabre was ordered to Korea. However, before any of these Sabres could reach the front, on 26 November 1950, Chinese armies intervened with devastating force in Korea, breaking through the United Nations lines and throwing them back in utter confusion.
The Chinese struck in the west, along the Chongchon River, and completely overran several South Korean divisions and successfully landed a heavy blow to the flank of the remaining UN forces. The ensuing defeat of the U.S. Eighth Army resulted in the longest retreat of any American military unit in history. In the east, at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, a 30,000-man unit from the U.S. 7th Infantry Division and U.S. Marine Corps was also unprepared for the Chinese tactics and was soon surrounded, though they eventually managed to escape the encirclement, after inflicting heavy casualties on six Chinese divisions.
However, the MiG-15s did not provide any effective air support for this invasion, being unable to establish any effective intervention below a narrow strip up near the Yalu. The MiG pilots were relatively inexperienced and were poor marksmen. They would seldom risk more than one pass at their targets before they would dart back north across the Yalu. Had the MiGs been able to establish and hold air superiority over the battle area, the UN forces may well have been thrown entirely out of Korea.
The first advanced detachment of 336th FIS F-86As arrived at Kimpo airfield (K-14) west of Seoul on 15 December. The first Sabre mission took place on 17 December. It was an armed reconnaissance of the region just south of the Yalu. Lt. Col. Bruce H. Hinton, commander of the 336th Squadron, succeeding in shooting down one MiG-15 out of a flight of four, to score first blood for the Sabre.
By the end of 1950, Chinese armies had driven UN forces out of North Korea and had begun to invade the South. The Sabres were forced to evacuate Kimpo and return to Japan which put them out of range of the action up at the Yalu. Even though the Yalu was now out of range, on 14 January, an F-86A detachment appeared at Taegu (K-37) to participate as fighter bombers to try to halt the Chinese advance. The F-86A was not very successful in the fighter-bomber role, being judged much less effective than slower types such as the F-80 and the F-84.
Eventually, the Chinese advance ground to a halt due to extended supply lines and the relentless UN air attacks. The Chinese advance was halted by the end of January, and the UN ground forces began pushing them back. Kimpo airfield was recovered on 10 February. The halting of the Chinese advance can be blamed largely on the inability of the MiGs to provide any effective support for the Chinese attack. Not only had no Chinese bombers appeared to attack UN troops, but no MiGs had flown south of the Yalu region to provide any air support.
MiG-15s versus B-29s.
In February 1951, a series of B-29 interdiction raids began against Chinese supply lines in northwest Korea. Up to early 1951, in the absence of organized defenses, B-29s had been able to make bombing runs at altitudes as low as 10,000 feet without any danger. On 25 February, four B-29s on a raid against Sunchon were attacked by eight MiG-15s. The MiG-15 was originally intended to intercept American bombers like the B-29. It was even evaluated in mock air-to-air combat trials with an interned ex-U.S. B-29, as well as the later Soviet B-29 copy, the Tupolev Tu-4. To ensure the destruction of such large bombers, the MiG-15 carried cannon armament: two 23 mm with 80 rounds per gun and a single 37 mm with 40.
With the appearance of the MiG-15 in the skies over North Korea, unescorted raids at low altitudes now became extremely dangerous. Consequently, the missions were now flown at 20,000 feet, defensive formations were used, and fighter escort was provided by F-80C and F-84E aircraft. These fighters were ineffective against the MiG-15, and coordination between the bombers and fighters was often poor.
On 1 March, a Superfortress formation was jumped by nine MiGs and on 12 April, a force of 48 B-29s attacking the railroad bridge linking Korea with Antung, Manchuria were attacked by dozens of MiGs, and three B-29s were shot down and seven were damaged. Because of these losses, General Stratemeyer called off these raids on 12 April and diverted the B-29s to close-support raids against Chinese targets further south around the 38th parallel.
In October 1951, USAF planners decided to concentrate on the destruction of Chinese air power in northern Korea before trying a more vigorous bombing policy. The B-29s were to launch attacks on Chinese air bases in north Korea. They were acting as bait, hoping to lure MiG-15s into battle, where they could be destroyed by F-86 fighters. However, the MiG squadrons had been widely dispersed, making it difficult for USAF intelligence to find them, and B-29 losses were heavy. By 27 October, five B-29s had been lost and 20 more heavily damaged.
MiG-15s could come in much higher than the B-29 escorts could fly, and dive directly into the bomber formation ripping them apart with blistering cannon fire. B-29 gunners had only a split second to fire on a diving Mig, and many times only put a few holes in it.
These raids were suspended and replaced by night attacks using B-29s equipped with navigation radar. This radar was able to pinpoint small targets with great accuracy. The 98th Wing was the first to be equipped, followed by the 19th and 307th. The first nighttime raids began in November 1952, and continued throughout the remainder of the Korean War. However, night fighters and radar-controlled defenses did cause significant losses. On 10 June 1952, four B-29s of the 19th Bomb Group were lit up by 24 searchlights. They were instantly attacked by 12 Migs which shot down two and severely damaged a third causing it to crash. The B-29 for all practical purposes had become a sitting duck. Between 18 Nov 1952, and 30 Jan 1953, communist night-fighters shot down five B-29s and severely damaged three more using a combination of Radar directed searchlights.
When the Korean War ended, the B-29s had flown over 21,000 sorties, nearly 167,000 tons of bombs had been dropped, and 34 B-29s had been lost in combat (16 to fighters, four to flak, and fourteen to other causes). B-29 gunners had accounted for 34 Communist fighters (16 of these being MiG-15s) probably destroyed another 17 (all MiG-15s) and damaged 11 (all MiG-15s).
With the appearance of the MiG-15 over the skies of Korea, the B-29, as well as all of the propeller-driven bombers in the USAF inventory, were simply rendered obsolete as strategic offensive weapons. It would take a new generation of swept-wing jet bombers, being able to fly higher and faster to effectively defeat the defense of the MiG-15 or subsequent Soviet-designed interceptors.
F-86s clear the skies.
The Chinese apparently did have plans for a major spring 1951 offensive to complete the task of driving the UN out of Korea. This plan was to be based on the construction of a series of North Korean air bases and for Chinese MiGs to use these bases as forward landing strips to provide air superiority over the North, preventing UN aircraft from interfering with the advance.
In early March, the MiGs began to become more active in support of this offensive, On 1 March 1951, MiGs attacked a formation of nine B-29s and severely damaged three of them. Fortunately, by this time the UN base at Suwon (K-13) was now ready, and the Sabres were now able to return to Korea and reenter the fray over the Yalu. The Sabres of the 334th Squadron began their first Yalu patrols on 6 March, and the rest of the squadron moved in four days later. At the same time, the 336th Squadron moved to Taegu (K-2) from Japan, so that they could stage Sabres through Suwon. The 4th Fighter Wing's other squadron, the 335th, stayed in Japan until 1 May.
The biggest air battle of that spring took place on 12 April when a formation of 39 B-29s escorted by F-84Es and F-86As were attacked by over 70 MiGs. Three B-29s were lost, whereas 14 MiGs were claimed destroyed, four by the escorting Sabres and ten by B-29 gunners.
The strip of airspace in western Korea just south of the Yalu RIver soon became known as "MiG Alley" to the Sabre pilots. The Sabres would arrive for their 25-minute patrols in five-minute intervals. The MiGs would usually cruise back and forth at high altitude on the other side of the Yalu, looking for an opportune time to intervene. Very often they would remain on the north side of the river, tantalizingly out of reach. When the MiGs did choose to enter battle, the Sabres would usually have only a fleeting chance to fire at the enemy before the MiGs broke off and escaped back across the Yalu. No F-86As were lost in action during the first five months of 1951, and they flew 3550 sorties and scored 22 victories. Most of the attrition was caused by accidents rather than by losses in actual combat.
In June 1951, the MiGs began to show more aggressive behavior, and their pilots began to get somewhat better. In air battles on 17, 18 and 19 June, six MiGs were destroyed but two Sabres were lost. Another Sabre was lost on 11 June when the 4th Wing covering an F-80 attack on the Sinuiju airfield shot down two more MiGs. As the first year of the Korean War came to an end, it was apparent that the F-86A Sabre had been instrumental in frustrating the MiG-15's bid for air superiority. Without control of the air, the Communist Chinese were unable to establish their series of air bases and they were not able to carry out effective air support of their spring offensive, and the Korean War settled down to a stalemate on the ground. The ground battle line was roughly the 38th Parallel where United Nations forces controlled most South Korean territory, and the Chinese and North Koreans controlled most North Korean territory, with some exceptions. It would remain that way for the rest of the war.
Throughout the summer and early fall of 1951, the Sabres of the 4th FIW continued to seek battle with the MiGs near the Yalu. For the next year and a half, the dual continued. New, improved models of the F-86 appeared with the F-86E entering action in Korea with the 4th Wing in July 1951, replacing that unit's F-86As on a one-by-one basis.
At any one time, only about 60 Sabres could be put into the air, assuming that everything was "right", with the rest of the force remaining at Kimpo or Suwon on alert or down for maintenance. Even when at maximum levels, the Sabre force was far outnumbered by the MiGs. By late 1951, there were enough MiGs available so that the Chinese forces attempted to move a couple of MiG squadrons into the base at Uiju Airfield, North Korea. UN air attacks soon made this base untenable, forcing the MiGs back across the Yalu.
It is now known that there were Soviet Air Force (VVS) fighter squadrons which participated in the air combat along the Yalu. They were rotated through the MiG bases on the northern side of the Yalu. Soviet Air Force MiGs operated from bases at Antung, Fengcheng, Tak Tung Kao, Takushan, Juantien, and others. At Mukden in Manchuria there were large numbers of MiGs waiting to replace those lost in battle or rotating home. Some Eastern Bloc units also participated. In addition, Soviet Units carried out extensive training of Chinese and North Korean pilots. Soviet archives that have only recently come to light officially list 345 Soviet-piloted MiG-15s having been lost to UN aircraft of all types during the Korean War. There are no comparable figures available for Chinese or North Korean losses. By the early spring of 1953, most of the Soviet units had been withdrawn from combat, and most of the MiGs were now being flown by Chinese or North Korean pilots.
On 22 October 1951 seventy-five new F-86Es were ordered shipped to Japan to replace the F-80Cs of the 51st Wing based at Suwon. The 51st Wing (consisting of the 16th and 25 FIS) began operations with its new F-86Es from Suwon on 1 December, with the famous World War II ace Col. Francis S. Gabreski as wing commander. The first kill for the 51st FIS was scored by Lt. Paul Roach of the 25th FIS on 2 December. Col. Gabreski had scored 31 kills over Europe in World War II, and he added 6.5 victories to his score in Korea.
In late 1951, the rules of engagement were modified, making it possible for UN pilots to cross the Yalu when in "hot pursuit" of an enemy. However, there were lots of unofficial violations of this rule, and there were some occasions in which bombing and strafing attacks were carried out by UN aircraft on Communist facilities north of the Yalu, and F-86s did on occasions went north of the Yalu looking for MiGs. There were even some MiG kills scored on the "wrong" side of the Yalu. The Manchurian sanctuary was lifted in the second week of April 1952.
The first F-86Fs reached Korea in June and July 1952, and they were issued to the 51st Wing's new 39th Squadron. F-86Fs were provided to the 335th Squadron of the 4th Wing in September 1952. The arrival of the F-86F quickly boosted Sabre victories in Korea. The 4th Wing's 335th Squadron scored a total of 81 victories during the remainder of 1952, while the other two 4th Wing squadrons (which were still operating F-86Es) got 41.
A wing modification to the Sabre, called the "6–3" gave the F-86F increased maximum speed .In addition, there was a slight improvement in range. The most significant improvement was, however, in the maneuverability at high altitudes and at high Mach numbers. Sabre wing modification conversion kits were shipped to Korea in high secrecy in September 1952 to convert F-86F aircraft already there to the new configuration. Enough kits were eventually supplied to convert all Korean-based F-86Fs and some F-86Es to this new configuration. The "6–3" wing was an immediate success, quickly boosting Sabre victories in Korea. With the "6-3-wing" F-86F, the USAF now had a fighter which could match the maximum speed of the MiG at altitudes all the way up to the Sabre's service ceiling of 47,000 feet, could turn inside the MiG, and which had almost as great a rate of climb. It was with F-86F with the "6–3" wing that the Sabre was to rack up its biggest score during the Korean War. Between 8 May 1953 and 31 May 1953, F-86Fs with 6–3 wings accounted for 56 MiG kills vs only one lost, one of the most one-sided air battles ever fought
The arrival of the "6–3" winged Sabre in Korea was soon to be followed by the fighter-bomber Sabre. The first F-86F-30-NA fighter-bombers arrived in Korea on 28 January 1953, and they equipped the 18th Fighter Bomber Wing based at Osan. This Wing flew its first Yalu patrol on 25 February, and scored its first MiG kill on the same day.
By the end of hostilities, F-86 pilots were credited with shooting down 792 MiGs for a loss of only 78 Sabres, a victory ratio of 10 to 1. Postwar totals officially credited by the USAF are 379 kills for 103 Sabres lost, amounting to a ratio of nearly 4 to 1. Modern research by Dorr, Lake and Thompson has claimed the actual ratio is closer to 2 to 1.
1953 Armistice.
Negotiations for an armistice had been going on for nearly eighteen months. It was thought that if a series of military targets could be located and then destroyed, the Communist side could be persuaded to agree to an armistice. The first of these raids took place on 11 July 1952 against 30 different targets in Pyongyang. Similar strikes took place against Sungho-Ri, Chosin, Sindok, and Sinuiju. The nighttime bombing techniques of the B-29 crews improved, and on 30 September 1952 45 B-29s wiped out the chemical plant at Namsan-Ri.
By late spring of 1953, the emphasis was again on Chinese airfields and bridges in the north. The objective was to keep these fields unserviceable since tentative truce terms had allowed for a 12-hour free period between the signing of the truce agreement and the time it became effective, which could have given the Communist side enough time to move in massive numbers of aircraft to the ten major North Korean airfields.
The Korean War ended on 27 July 1953, with the in which the country remained divided into two. The last Sabre/MiG fight of the Korean War took place on 22 July 1953, when Lt. Sam P. Young of the 31st Wing scored his first and only victory. The last kill of the Korean War took place on 27 July, when Capt. Ralph S. Parr flying an F-86F-30 shot down an Il-12 twin-engined transport aircraft. At the end of the Korean War, the seven American fighter Wings in Korea had 297 Sabres on hand, with 132 of them being with fighter-bomber Wings.
Korean War Campaigns.
There were ten designated campaigns for Korean War Service.
Post Korean War.
On 21 September 1953, LT No Kum-Sok flew his MiG-15 to the Kimpo Air Base in South Korea, claiming that he wanted to get away from the "red deceit." He received a $100,000 reward offered by Operation Moolah for defecting with his aircraft, which he claimed to have not heard about prior to his defection.
According to U.S. estimates, about one million South Koreans were killed or went missing during the war, 85% of them civilians. According to figures published in the Soviet Union, around 1.13 million people, or 11.1% of the total population, were killed in North Korea (with the total casualties of some 2.5 million). More than 80% of the industrial and public facilities and transportation infrastructure, three-quarters of all government buildings, and half of all housing was destroyed.
Both North and South Korea were devastated by the war, and the armistice has generally been adhered to by the North Koreans. As the Armistice took hold, the U.S. Air Force redeployed all but one tactical fighter wing from the peninsula, and in November 1954 Fifth Air Force was relieved from assignment for combat forces in South Korea. Fifth Air Force returned to Japan, where it was responsible for maintaining a strong tactical posture for the defense of Japan. The defense of South Korea became the responsibility of the 314th Air Division, which exercised that responsibility until 8 September 1986.
Until the late 1960s The USAF in South Korea remained relatively dormant, hosting temporary deployments of flying units and serving as a safe haven base for aircraft evacuated from Okinawa and Guam during typhoons.
The 58th Fighter-Bomber Wing moved from Taegu AB to Osan-Ni AB in March 1955, and became the only permanently assigned tactical fighter wing on the peninsula. On 18 September 1956, the base was redesignated Osan AB—its current name. In July 1958, the U.S. Air Force inactivated the 58th FBW. At this time, the Eisenhower Administration promulgated a nuclear deterrence strategy. Osan AB thus became the main base of operations for air-to-ground Matador tactical missiles. Concurrently, Fifth Air Force complemented this strategy by instituting rotational deployments of fighter aircraft units to Osan and Kunsan ABs from its Far East bases and the U.S. to bolster the defense of the Republic of Korea as it steadily trained and equipped the ROK Air Force.
In Asia, tensions in the Taiwan Straits in 1954 and 1958 threatened to erupt into open warfare between the United States and the People's Republic of China, and the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union shifted from to Berlin in the early 1960s.
Also what began as a small US military assistance program to South Vietnam in the 1950s, grew into a wider regional conflict by 1965. An all-out war between South Vietnam and North Vietnam in which the United States was deeply involved erupted. American efforts focused on four major areas of combat: South Vietnam, North Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. South Korea was largely ignored.
1968 Pueblo Seizure.
On 23 January 1968 the United States Navy ship USS Pueblo (AGER-2) was boarded and captured by the North Koreans. The ship and its crew were taken to the port at Wonsan and the crew was taken hostage.
North Korea stated that the Pueblo strayed into their territorial waters, but the United States maintains that the vessel was in international waters at the time of the incident. More recently, facts have come to light that indicate that ship was captured by North Korea at the instigation of the Soviet Union, which was seeking a cryptographic machine on board to match with a "key" provided to the Soviets by the spy John Walker.
In response to the Pueblo seizure, the USAF deployed three augmented squadrons of the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing in January 1968 through July 1968 and then from the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing, flying the F-100 Super Sabre to Kunsan Air Base in July 1968, as part of the buildup of forces in Korea in the wake of the seizure. The 354th was equipped with two activated Air National Guard squadrons, and the wing consisted primarily of ANG and Air Force Reservists from other units, the bulk of USAF active duty airpower in the Pacific being committed to South Vietnam or Thailand at the time. On 10 June 1968, the ANG squadrons returned to the United States after the men of the Pueblo were released.
1969 Navy EC-121 Shootdown.
On 15 April 1969, a Navy EC-121 reconnaissance plane was shot down by North Koreans about 90 miles southeast of the North Korean port of Chongjin. U.S. radar tracked two NKAF MiGs before the aircraft was shot down. They attempted to warn the aircraft, but the MiGs caught up with the slow-flying aircraft. All of its 31 crew members were killed. The bodies of only two crew members were recovered. Error was blamed on a North Korean ground-to-air controller's command and control error to the pilot.
As a result of these incidents with the North Koreans, and the resulting heightened tensions in the Korean peninsula, on 23 April the 421st Tactical Fighter Squadron was activated at Kunsan Air Base and attached to the 354th TFW. F-4Es from Eglin AFB were deployed to Kunsan and assigned to the 421st, with support personnel from the 4th TFS – deployed from Eglin to Da Nang Air Base South Vietnam were sent TDY to Kunsan to support the 421st.
At the end of tensions on 26 June 1969, the 421 TFS was inactivated at Kunsan, with the aircraft being sent to Da Nang as replacements along with the TDY personnel.
On 14 June 1970, the 354 TFW at Kunsan was inactivated with the new 54th Tactical Fighter Wing being activated in place. The 16th and 478th TFSs were transferred and attached to the 54th.
Post Vietnam era.
On 15 March 1971, the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing was activated at Kunsan AB. At Osan Air Base, PACAF activated the 51st Air Base Wing to assume host-unit responsibilities at Osan AB on 1 November 1971. Two weeks later, on 13 November, the 3rd TFW's 36th Tactical Fighter Squadron moved to Osan AB.
Total withdrawal of U.S. forces from Southeast Asia by 1976 resulted in another important change for Osan AB. On 30 September 1974, the 51st ABW was redesignated as the 51st Composite Wing (Tactical), and assigned the 36th TFS with its F-4D/E Phantoms and 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron with its OV-10A Broncos.
In September 1974 the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing moved from Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand to replace the 3rd at Kunsan. The move took place in name only, as the 8th moved without personnel or equipment, absorbing all assets of the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing. This included the two flying squadrons, which continued to operate as the 35th and 80th Tactical Fighter Squadrons, reuniting the wing with two of its original squadrons.
Seventh Air Force.
On 8 September 1986, Seventh Air Force activated at Osan AB, and assumed the mission of maintaining the armistice on the Korean peninsula previously performed by the 314th Air Division.
Activities by Seventh Air Force has been dictated largely by mission changes and enhancements, and the threat from North Korea. Introduction of the F-16 Falcon in 1988 led to construction of hardened aircraft shelters at Osan AB
As the ROK's military grew and matured into a formidable force by the late 1990s, political and military leaders from both countries reexamined the role of U.S. forces based on the peninsula. A major change in U.S. strategic policy coinciding with the "9–11" terrorist attack on the Twin Towers in New York required a "transformation" of global U.S. military commitments and basing. The military had to adapt from a fixed, in-garrison-type force to a mobile, responsive force.
For its part, U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) studied how technological advances in weaponry could mitigate a reduction in personnel while the ROK military forces carried out an increasing role to protect its sovereignty. The result of this effort led to the landmark agreement known as the Land Partnership Plan in 2002 and the Security Policy Initiative in 2003 between the U.S. and the ROK governments. These decisions reflected a realignment in the roles and missions of USFK that forecast a significant reshaping and growth through 2011.
Since reaching this agreement, both as U.S. Air Forces Korea, under the joint USFK, and the USAF component to the United States and Republic of Korea Combined Forces Command's Air Component Command, Seventh AF has been an integral part of deterring aggression from North Korea.
Due to the ongoing threat of aggression from North Korea, USAF personnel assigned to South Korea are exempt from Expeditionary duty as part of the Global War on Terrorism.
USAF Units assigned to South Korea since July 1953.

Queen's Bridge (New Jersey)

The Queen's Bridge is a bridge spanning the Raritan River that connects South Bound Brook and Bound Brook, both of which are in Somerset County, New Jersey. The bridge carries South Main Street across the river.
History.
One of the earliest bridges at this site was a wooden one built in 1767. Later, in 1771, an act was passed that provided for the maintenance of the bridge as the Queen's Bridge. Over a hundred years later, a class steel pipe truss bridge was built at the site in 1875 to replace the previous one. The current bridge's span was built in 1984.

Pilot Knob (Austin, Texas)

Pilot Knob is the eroded core of an extinct volcano located south of central Austin, Texas, near Austin-Bergstrom International Airport and McKinney Falls State Park.
Introduction.
Pilot Knob is one of around 75 late-Cretaceous Period volcanic complexes scattered around Central Texas from Waco to Austin, San Antonio, and Del Rio. All of these volcanoes have been extinct for millions of years.
The Pilot Knob volcanic complex consists of four small, rounded hills (including Pilot Knob proper) forming the volcano's core area in an area two miles in diameter. The hills are composed of trap rock which is an erosion-resistant, fine-grained mafic volcanic rock. The complex rises above a circular lowland drained by Cottonmouth Creek and is underlain chiefly by volcanic ash and other pyroclastic debris. Several smaller bodies of trap rock occur in the volcanic ash. A topographic rim surrounding the Cottonmouth Creek lowland to the north is formed by sedimentary rock, mainly lithified beach sediments composed of shell fragments and reworked volcanic ash that accumulated in the shallow waters around the volcano.
History of the volcano.
In late-Cretaceous time, Central Texas was part of a vast marine shelf on which carbonate rocks were deposited with the entire area gradually subsiding as sediments were laid down. The volcano formed when magma worked its way to the surface and encountered water-laden, unconsolidated sediments with the existing water rapidly vaporizing into steam resulting in an enormous explosion that formed an explosion crater. Explosive eruptions continued at Pilot Knob as new magma encountered more water in the volcanic ash. Gradually, an ash cone was built up over the explosion crater. Eruptions of ash continued until the mound grew above the level of the shallow sea. Ash beds, now altered to clay, occur interbedded with limestone and marl of the Austin Group around Pilot Knob; these ash beds provide evidence for subaerial eruptions at Pilot Knob. The Pilot Knob ash cone eventually built an unstable slope on the sea bottom, resulting in mud flows of ash and carbonate mud which tore up the underlying carbonate mud in places and injected itself into the carbonate mud at other places. The subaerial Pilot Knob ash cone allowed the intrusion of magma into the mound without contact with sea water, resulting in quieter lava eruptions. Such magma cooled and solidified to form the core and satellite areas of the trap rock. Some of the trap rock bodies are the erosional remnants of lava flows, due to their apparent dip away from the central core area. Cooling joints exposed on a hill about west of Pilot Knob suggest a dip of that trap rock body towards the center of the core area, possibly indicating that it is the erosional remnant of a cone sheet injected outwards from a central, discordant intrusive body of magma. Exposures at other bodies of trap rock are not generally good enough to determine their exact emplacement, but some, at least, are probably plugs of solidified intrusive magma. Magnetic anomalies on the northeast flank of the core area suggest a buried trap rock body within the ash mound, possibly a cone sheet or lava flow.
As volcanic activity diminished, beaches developed around the volcano. One such beach deposit, now lithified and resistant to erosion, extends several miles to the north of the volcano. It appears along Onion Creek, where it is responsible for both Upper and Lower McKinney Falls. The entire shelf continued to subside after volcanic activity ceased, and muds of the Taylor Group gradually covered the entire volcano. During the Tertiary era, the central Texas area was uplifted, exposing the volcano as younger sedimentary rocks were eroded from the Cretaceous volcanic rocks. Today the terrain at Pilot Knob reflects the relative resistance to erosion of the different rock types that appear around the volcanic complex.
Dating the volcanic activity.
Two different approaches have been used by geologists to date the volcanism at Pilot Knob. The first approach was through the stratigraphy of the rocks at and around Pilot Knob and the fossils they contain. The second approach was by isotopic age dating of the igneous rocks. The two means are very different, but supplement each other nicely.
Stratigraphy.
The volcano at Pilot Knob exerted a profound influence on the stratigraphy of the Upper Cretaceous sedimentary rocks of the Austin area. The volcanism occurred during the deposition of the upper part of the Dessau and the Burditt formations of the Austin Chalk. These strata are only about one-third as thick near Pilot Knob as they are in other localities around Austin. The faunal zones of the two formations, that is zones within the formations where certain fossils are particularly abundant, are also telescoped in the vicinity of Pilot Knob. Two beds of altered ash occur within the Dessau Formation on Rinard Creek near Pilot Knob. The exact relationship of the beach rock of the northern flank of Pilot Knob with the normal Austin Chalk has been demonstrated to be part of the Exponderosa erraticosta zone, although it may extend down to an age equivalent to the upper part of the Dessau in some areas along Onion Creek. The beach rock is now known as the McKown Formation of the Austin Chalk. Because the volcanism at Pilot Knob occurred during the deposition of the Dessau and Burditt Formations, an age of Lower Campanian (83 to 79 million years BP) can be interpreted for the volcanism according to the ages of the formations in the Austin Chalk, correlated to radiometric dated sections in the Rocky Mountain Region.
Isotopic age.
The potassium-argon method was utilized to determine the age of volcanism at Pilot Knob. This method is based upon the decay of the radioactive isotope of potassium (potassium 40) to argon 40, an isotope of argon, an inert gas. By knowing the concentration of potassium in a rock mineral and the amount of argon gas produced by radioactive decay trapped within the minerals, an age can be assigned to the rock because the decay rate of potassium 40 to argon 40 is known from experimental work. The age of Pilot Knob volcanism dated through the potassium-argon method is 79.5 +/- 3 million years, and agrees with the age derived by correlation with fossils to other radiometrically dated deposits.
Source of the magma.
The igneous rocks of the Pilot Knob volcano have not, as yet, undergone rigorous petrological study, although such studies are in progress. Similar rocks near Uvalde, Texas, of about the same age, have been studied. The Uvalde rocks are of the same igneous province as the Pilot Knob rocks; both are centers in a chain of volcanic and intrusive complexes that parallel the buried Ouachita structural belt in central and south Texas. The Ouachita belt may have provided a zone of crustal weakness where magma could rise from great depths through the crust to the surface. 
Two types of magma have been determined to have generated in the Earth's upper mantle by partial melting of mantle rocks. One of these magma types is basaltic in composition, composed of plagioclase, titanium-rich pyroxene, and olivine. The other magma type crystallized to nepheline, melilite, pyroxene, and, in some of the rocks, plagioclase. Some nepheline-bearing igneous rocks contain rounded inclusions of spinel peridotite, an ultramafic rock that may represent fragments of the upper mantle incorporated into the magma during its ascent to the surface. Most of the igneous rocks on the surface probably are not representative of the original magmas formed in the mantle; certain processes, such as separation of phenocrysts from the liquid from which they crystallized have altered their original chemical compositions at depths shallower than the mantle. 
By inference, the rocks at Pilot Knob crystallized from partial melts of the upper mantle. Only rocks of the second series have been discovered at Pilot Knob; no basaltic rocks have been located. No mantle fragments have been located in Pilot Knob igneous rocks, but their presence is suspected, and some of the olivine phenocrysts in the rocks may be fragments derived from the upper mantle.
Location.
Pilot Knob can be reached by driving out Highway 183 past Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. The hill is visible on the right after crossing Onion Creek. A circuit of the volcanic complex can be made by turning right off Highway 183 onto Dee Gabriel Collins Road and heading west to the intersection with McKinney Falls Parkway. Turn left and follow the Parkway to the intersection with Colton Bluff Springs Road, where a left turn leads back to Highway 183. Dee Gabriel Collins closely follows the northern topographic rim of the volcano formed by the escarpment of the Cretaceous beach rock. The lowland is drained by Cottonmouth Creek and underlain by soft, easily eroded volcanic ash and other pyroclastic deposits, and the central core area formed by the resistant trap rock are easily visible to the south of Dee Gabriel Collins. About 2/3 of a mile east of the intersection of Bluff Springs Road with McKinney Falls Parkway, the trap rock of south Pilot Knob crops out along the road. This rock is very similar to that which forms the center of the volcano, and may represent the eroded remnant of a lava flow erupted along the flanks of the volcano or having flowed down the south side from the apex. 
Except for the road margins, Pilot Knob volcano lies entirely on private land.

Primarily Obsessional OCD

Primarily Obsessional Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (also commonly called Purely Obsessional OCD, Pure-O, OCD without overt compulsions or with covert compulsions) is a lesser-known form or manifestation of OCD. For people with primarily obsessional OCD, there are less observable compulsions, compared to those commonly seen with the typical form of OCD (checking, counting, hand-washing etc.). While ritualizing and neutralizing behaviors do take place, they are mostly cognitive in nature, involving mental avoidance and excessive rumination. Primarily obsessional OCD often takes the form of horrific intrusive thoughts of a distressing or violent nature.
Common themes.
Primarily obsessional OCD has been called "one of the most distressing and challenging forms of OCD." People with this form of OCD have "distressing and unwanted thoughts pop into head frequently", and the thoughts "typically center on a fear that you may do something totally uncharacteristic of yourself, something ...potentially fatal...to yourself or others." The thoughts "quite likely, are of an aggressive or sexual nature."
The nature and type of primarily obsessional OCD varies greatly, but the central theme for all sufferers is the emergence of a disturbing intrusive thought or question, an unwanted/inappropriate mental image, or a frightening impulse that causes the person extreme anxiety because it is antithetical to closely held religious beliefs, morals, or societal mores. The fears associated with primarily obsessional OCD tend to be far more personal and terrifying for the sufferer than what the fears of someone with traditional OCD may be. Pure-O fears usually focus on self-devastating scenarios that the sufferer feels would ruin their life or the lives of those around them. An example of this difference could be that someone with traditional OCD is overly concerned or worried about security or cleanliness. While this is still distressing, it is not to the same level as someone with Pure-O, who may be terrified that they have undergone a radical change in their sexuality (i.e.: might be or might have changed into a pedophile or become homosexual), that they might be a murderer or that they might cause any form of harm to a loved one or an innocent person, or to themselves, or that they will go insane. 
They will understand that these fears are unlikely or even impossible but the anxiety felt will make the obsession seem real and meaningful. While those without primarily obsessional OCD might instinctively respond to bizarre intrusive thoughts or impulses as insignificant and part of a normal variance in the human mind, someone with Pure-O will respond with profound alarm followed by an intense attempt to neutralize the thought or avoid having the thought again. The person begins to ask themselves constantly "Am I really capable of something like that?" or "Could that really happen?" or "Is that really me?" (even though they usually realize that their fear is irrational, which causes them further distress) and puts tremendous effort into escaping or resolving the unwanted thought. They then end up in a vicious cycle of mentally searching for reassurance and trying to get a definitive answer.
Common intrusive thoughts/obsessions include themes of:
Diagnosis and treatment.
Those suffering from primarily obsessional OCD might appear normal and high-functioning, yet spend a great deal of time ruminating, trying to solve or answer any of the questions that cause them distress.
For example, an intrusive thought "I could just kill Bill with this steak knife" is followed by a catastrophic misinterpretation of the thought, i.e. "How could I have such a thought? Deep down, I must be a psychopath." This might lead a person to continually surf the web, reading numerous articles on defining psychopathy. This reassurance-seeking ritual will, ironically, provide no further clarification and could exacerbate the intensity of the search for the answer. There are numerous corresponding cognitive biases present, including thought-action fusion, over-importance of thoughts, and need for control over thoughts.
Despite how real and imposing the intrusive thoughts may be to an individual, the sufferer will probably never carry out actions related to these thoughts, even if one believes themselves capable of doing so. One of the reasons for this is because the person in question will go to extreme lengths to avoid circumstances which could trigger their intrusive thoughts.
The disorder is particularly easy to miss by many well-trained clinicians, as it closely resembles markers of generalized anxiety disorder and does not include observable, compulsive behaviors. Clinical "success" is reached when the Pure-O sufferer becomes indifferent to the need to answer the question. While many clinicians will mistakenly offer reassurance and try to help their patient achieve a definitive answer (an unfortunate consequence of therapists treating primarily obsessional OCD as generalized anxiety disorder), this method only contributes to the intensity or length of the patient's rumination, as the neuropathways of the OCD brain will predictably come up with creative ways to "trick" the person out of reassurance, negating any temporary relief and perpetuating the cycle of obsessing.
The most effective treatment for primarily obsessional OCD appears to be Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. More specifically exposure and response prevention (ERP) as well as Cognitive Therapy (CT) which may or may not be combined with the use of medication, such as SSRIs. People suffering from OCD without overt compulsions are considered by some researchers more refractory towards ERP compared to other OCD sufferers and therefore ERP can prove less successful than CT.
Exposure and response prevention (ERP) of Pure-O is theoretically based on the principles of classical conditioning and extinction. The spike often presents itself as a paramount question or disastrous scenario. A response that answers the spike in a way that leaves ambiguity is sometimes warranted. "If I don't remember what I had for breakfast yesterday my mother will die of cancer!" Using the antidote procedure, a cognitive response would be one in which the subject accepts this possibility and is willing to take the risk of his mother dying of cancer or the question recurring for eternity. No effort is expended in directly answering the question in an effort to find resolution. In another example, the spike would be, "Maybe I said something offensive to my boss yesterday." A recommended response would be, "Maybe I did. I'll live with the possibility and take the risk he'll fire me tomorrow." Using this procedure, it is imperative that the distinction be made between the therapeutic response and rumination. The therapeutic response does not seek to answer the question but to accept the uncertainty of the unsolved dilemma.
Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a newer approach that also is used to treat POCD as well as other mental disorders (anxiety, depression etc.)

2008 Yingjiang earthquakes

The 2008 Yingjiang Earthquakes were a series of major earthquakes ranging from surface wave magnitude (Ms) 4.1 to 5.9 that struck Yingjiang County, Yunnan province, China between August 19 (in UTC; August 20 local time) and September 3, 2008. It caused 5 deaths, 21 serious injuries, and RMB 2.7 billion in direct economic damage. USGS put the magnitude of the strongest one to Mw 6.0.
Earthquake Details.
According to the China Earthquake Administration (CEA) and its subordinate China Earthquake Network Center (CENC), a Ms 5.0 earthquake struck Yingjiang County, Yunnan province, China on August 20, 2008 at 05:35:09 China Standard Time (CST - 2135 UTC, August 19, 2008). A CEA report published on September 17 described two additional strong quakes of Ms 4.9 and Ms 5.9 in the same area the following day; CENC's data base, on the other hand, did not include the earthquake of Ms 4.9 at 20:20 CST on August 21 as the CEA report described, but reveals additional ones after the date.
Sequence of earthquakes.
Note: Earthquakes #4 and after are not included in CEA summary; earthquake #2 is unaccounted for in CENC data base.
Response, casualties, and intensities.
According to CEA, these earthquakes caused 5 deaths and 21 serious injuries. Through Yunnan Earthquake Administration (YNEA), the provincial government invoked Level IV emergence response protocol in the relief. Affected people amounted to 209,605, roughly 2/3 of the total population in affected areas. Direct financial damages amounted to RMB 1.3 billion. In addition to building damages, the heaviest infrastructure damages occurred to water resources facilities.
On the seismic intensity map published by CEA, maximum intensity of these earthquakes reached liedu VIII on China Seismic Intensity Scale (CSIS), which is somewhat equivalent to VIII (Heavily damaging) on EMS-94 from which CSIS drew reference. Liedu-VIII zone spans 26 km2 near the epicenter. Total area of liedu VI (Slightly damaging) and above is a north-south oval of 4,511 km2.

Tell Ishchali

Tell Ishchali is an archaeological site in Diyala Province (Iraq). It is thought to be ancient Nerebtum or Kiti and was part of the city-state of Eshnunna. It was occupied during the Old Babylonian period.
Ancient name.
At first, the site of Ishchali was thought to be Khafajah. Upon discovery there of a date formula that read "year that king Ishme-Bali built the great wall of Nerebtum", that designation became popular. Currently, scholarly opinion is split between Nerebtum and Kiti as the result of many tablets from the temple of Inanna of Kiti being analyzed. The name of Sadlas has also been proposed.
History of archaeological research.
Items from illegal excavations at Ishchali began appearing on the open market in the 1920s, including many clay tablets. To pre-empt this activity, the Iraq expedition of the Oriental Institute of Chicago conducted two seasons of excavations there in 1934 and 1935. The expedition was led by Henri Frankfort and the work at Ishchali was handled by Thorkild Jacobsen and Harold Hill, all of the Oriental Institute.
Tell Ishchali and its environment.
The site lies about south and east of the modern city of Baghdad and southeast of Eshnunnaon the Diyala River, a tributary of the Tigris. The main tell at Ishchali measures roughly . There are also small mounds to the north and south of it. The entire site covers around .
History of occupation.
Surface finds indicate that Ishchali may have been occupied as far back as the Akkadian period, but all excavated epigraphic evidence dates to the Old Babylonian period. While some tablets mention early local rulers, for most of the known history of Ishchali kings from Eshnunna held sway there, including Ipiq-Adad and Ibal-pi-El.
The most notable feature of Ishchali is the main temple. It was that of Inanna-Kitium, or Inanna of Kiti. It is one of the largest temples ever found in the ancient Near East. Rebuilt several times, always following the original plan, the monumental building consisted of one large upper temple and two smaller areas which are thought to be shrines. The many tablets found there give an excellent picture of temple life. A number of cylinder seals dating from the Early Dynastic to the Larsa period were also found there, assumed to be relic donations to the temple.
Material culture.
Of the 280 tablets excavated, 138 went to the Oriental Institute with the remaining 142 assigned to the Iraq Museum. The tablets illegally excavated from Ishchali are in many locations including the Lowie Museum of Anthropology at Berkeley, the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire in Geneva, Iraq Museum, Oriental Institute, and the Free Library of Philadelphia.

Synthestration

Synthestration is the art of arranging music in midi for playback by computers triggering either synthesizers, or samplers, in order to emulate an orchestral recording.
The process involves inputting notes into a computer sequencing program as midi, which then produces those tones on electronic instruments. These instruments can either be software synthesizers, orchestral sample libraries, or external hardware. The midi values (e.g. velocity), controllers, automation and the sounds themselves often need to be manipulated in great detail in order to mimic the articulation and ensemble playing of an orchestra or group of players.
The term is a combination of the words 'synth(esizer)' and 'orchestration' (where a musical work is arranged for instruments, traditionally from one or two solo instruments to orchestra).

Pin Malakul

Mom Luang Pin Malakul (, 24 October 1903 – 5 October 1995) was a Thai educator and writer. His contributions to education in Thailand include the establishment of various institutions of higher education, the introduction of fixed class schedules, and the implementation of teacher-training programmes. In his career he served as Director-General of the Department of General Education, later becoming Permanent Secretary, and Minister, of Education. He was also a member of the Executive Board of UNESCO. His writings earned him the title of National Artist in 1987, and the 100th anniversary of his birth was celebrated by the UNESCO in 2003 as recognition of his contribution to the advancement of education in Thailand and Southeast Asia.
Personal life.
Early life and education.
Mom Luang Pin Malakul (hereafter referred to as ML Pin) was born on 24 October 1903 to Mom Rajawongse Pia (MR Pia) and Thanpuying Sa-ngiam Malakul. He was the sixth of thirteen children (although the fourth, and the only son, to survive past birth). His father, a nobleman and great-grandson of King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai, had served as King Vajiravudh's guardian during the King's overseas studies and held posts including Ambassador to the United Kingdom. MR Pia's work was instrumental in the establishment of higher education in Thailand (then known as Siam) and he later became the third Minister of Public Instruction under King Vajiravudh.
ML Pin recalled in his autobiography that although his mother was a kind and loving figure, his father was rather strict and acted more like a teacher than a father, and that he was often fearful of him. A loyal servant of the crown, MR Pia introduced ML Pin to King Vajiravudh when he was seven years old. Another often-recounted story from his childhood is that of how, before having learned to count, when his mother asked him to gather half a bunch of betel leaves for her, ML Pin set down to picking up one leaf with each hand at a time, separating them equally into two piles.
At the age of four, ML Pin began receiving preliminary education from teachers who came to teach at the family home on Damrongrak Road, next to Varadis Palace. He enrolled at Suankularb Wittayalai School (then known as Wat Ratchaburana School) shortly before turning seven in 1910, and after half a year his examination results placed him at "Mathayom" 1 level. In 1914 he was accepted into the Royal Pages School (now Vajiravudh College). Half a year later, King Vajiravudh named him one of eight Royal Page Students () in the King's personal service. Although he did not attend regular classes at the school afterwards, he passed exams at "Mathayom" 5 level (grade 11) at the end of the school year.
As a Royal Page Student, ML Pin's duties included various tasks in the royal household as well as accompanying the King in his various activities. The Royal Page Students were involved in plays and sports games held in court and also in activities of the King's scouting-related paramilitary movement, the Wild Tiger Corps. ML Pin also became an editor of the "Dusit Samit" Magazine, part of the King's Dusit Thani miniature city/micronation project. One memorable task appointed to him by the King was to determine the day of week King Naresuan left Ayutthaya for his famous elephant duel, a problem ML Pin was unable to solve at the time, but became the inspiration for his later development of the "Everlasting Calendar". He lived in the royal court most of the time and received a salary of twenty to thirty baht.
Life in Europe.
In 1922, when ML Pin was eighteen years old, the Ministry of Public Instruction, in accordance with the King's wishes, granted him a government scholarship for a tertiary education in ancient Eastern languages in the United Kingdom. He departed abroad the MS Jutlandia on 23 January 1922 and arrived in London on 7 March.
During his first two years, ML Pin studied Pali and Sanskrit at the University of London School of Oriental and African Studies and lived with Mr and Mrs L J Marshall of 23 Portland Place in Brighton, from whom he also received additional instruction in mathematics, English and French. Such was his talent in mathematics that Mr Marshall, who was head of Mathematics and Surveying at Brighton Technical College, wrote to the Superintendent of Siamese Government Students recommending that ML Pin major in mathematics instead and saying that his skills would undoubtedly warrant a university scholarship for mathematical studies. This, however, did not suit the requirements of the Ministry of Public Instruction, and so ML Pin did not continue his mathematics education. Nevertheless, his interest in the field did not waver, and he continued to produce works on the subject. Among these are his publication in 1927 in "Samaggi Sara", the journal of Samaggi Samagom (the Thai Association in the UK), of a formula which he called the "Everlasting Calendar", upon which he later based the development of a set of slide rules which could be used to calculate the day of week for any given date, and his publication of "Miscellaneous Problems", a collection of various mathematical problems he had worked on, later in 1960.
In England ML Pin formed close friendships with fellow Thai students Prince Dulbhakara Worawan, Visuddhi Krairiksh and Phanom Thephasdin, the first of which with whom he had been friends since their time as Royal Page Students. He also developed a taste for opera and classical music, on which he recalled spending quite a disproportionate amount of his scholarship's allowance, eventually building a collection of 317 records.
ML Pin was accepted into Brasenose College of the University of Oxford in 1924, where he studied in the Honour School of Oriental Studies for four years. He graduated with a BA degree on 28 June 1928. He then enrolled in a one-year course in education also at Oxford, according to the wishes of the Ministry of Public Instruction. He practice-taught at The Latymer School during the school year, but fell ill during the winter and again near the end of the school year late in the spring of 1929, which adversely affected his studies. He was later awarded the Oxbridge MA degree on 15 October 1931.
After finishing his studies, ML Pin accompanied Princess Kalyanga Sombati Kitiyakara on a one-month trip in Europe. Upon return to London, he attended the First World Conference on Adult Education on behalf of Siam, but during the same time his health deteriorated further, and he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Accordingly, his return trip to Siam had to be postponed in order for him to recover in Switzerland. There he spent almost two years in Davos and later Klosters, until September 1931 when he attended the League of Nations annual conference before returning to Siam via a Nippon Yusen ship departing from Naples, Italy. He finally arrived in Siam on 23 October 1931, after spending over nine years abroad.
Marriage.
ML Pin married Miss Dussadeemala Krairiksh, daughter of Chao Phraya Mahithon and Thanpuying Klip, on 7 March 1932. They lived at the Krairiksh family home before building a house on the Damrongrak Road property, and finally settled at Soi Chaiyot on Sukhumvit Road in 1938. They had no children.
Work.
Early years.
Upon ML Pin's return from Europe in 1931, Public Instruction Minister Prince Dhani Nivat appointed him as a government official under Krom Vichakan, a department of the ministry. He also served the Prince in a somewhat unofficial capacity, assisting the Prince's work and observing the ministry's various goings-on. Under the Prince's directions, ML Pin became an instructor in Mathematics, Thai and English at Chulalongkorn University, in addition to the various duties he performed for the ministry. In 1934, he became head of the university's teacher-preparation programme and Headmaster of the Horwang Secondary School of Chulalongkorn University, which served as the country's first demonstration (teacher training) school. He began developing projects for the school, although few of them were realised at the time. One such project was the creation of the country's first school workshop.
In 1938, Plaek Pibulsonggram, as President of Chulalongkorn University, assigned ML Pin the duty of overseeing the establishment of Chulalongkorn's University Preparatory School according to the National Education Plan of BE 2479 (1936 CE). Although given a tight timeframe of only three months, the new school was created on the location of Horwang School, and gradually absorbed the older school, the entire staff merging within a few years. ML Pin became the first director of the school, which was the country's first coeducational, and is now known as Triam Udom Suksa School and widely regarded as one of the best schools in the country. During his term as director, which lasted until 1944, he developed and implemented a fixed class schedule system, along with a mechanical timetable used to assign teaching periods, which is still in use today.
As World War II reached Thailand in December 1941, Japanese troops raided and occupied the school, forcing teachers and students to evacuate and relocate to temporary locations around Bangkok, and later to various other provinces. At one point, ML Pin disguised himself as a janitor to smuggle important documents and cash out of the school.
In 1942, not long after the invasion, Prime Minister Pibulsonggram assumed the post of Education Minister himself, and appointed ML Pin as Director-General of the Department of General Education. Although resources were limited due to the war, ML Pin was able to manage the budget and personnel to allow a countrywide 12 baht salary for rural local schoolteachers. During his term, every province was provided with at least one upper-secondary school. He also became involved in frequent school migrations due to both the war and changing policy.
One issue with which ML Pin was deeply concerned was that of the country's teacher-training system, an issue he stressed during an audience with King Ananda Mahidol after the war in 1946, and would later address during his term as Permanent Secretary of Education.
As Permanent Secretary of Education.
ML Pin became Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education in 1946. In this capacity, he oversaw the founding in 1949 of the Higher Teacher Training School at Prasanmit, now Srinakharinwirot University, and the drafting of the first national education plan.
Administration-wise, Krom Vichakan (or the Department of Curriculum and Instruction Development) was re-created in 1952 and the Department of Teacher Education was created in 1954, along with the expansion of the Higher Teacher Training School to become the College of Education, of which ML Pin served as president until 1956. He later oversaw the creation of the College's Prasanmit Primary Demonstration School.
ML Pin also pioneered the field of distance education via the "Educational Radio" broadcasting station, which was set up at Thung Maha Mek Technical College in 1954. Despite obstacles and limited support, the programme proved successful and continually developed, and is now under the authority of the Centre for Educational Technology.
As permanent secretary, ML Pin acted as the head delegate for Thailand to the third UNESCO General Conference in Beirut in 1948, where Thailand was an observer, and represented Thailand as the country filed for membership in 1949 and was accepted as the fifty-fifth member state. He served as director and coordinator for the Seminar on Rural Adult Education in Mysore, India, that year, and regularly represented Thailand in subsequent UNESCO meetings.
He was elected to two terms on the UNESCO Executive Board from 1952 to 1956, during which he supported and helped advance UNESCO's programmes for promotion of universal compulsory education in Asian countries. His representation also lead to cooperative projects between the UNESCO and Thailand, including the Thailand UNESCO Rulral Teacher Education Project and the Thailand UNESCO Fundamental Education Center at Ubon Ratchathani Province, among others. Even after his term ended as permanent secretary, ML Pin was still involved in UNESCO activities in Thailand. He facilitated the establishment of UNESCO's regional office in Bangkok, which opened in 1961, and was among the founders of the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization.
As Minister of Education.
In 1957 Army Commander Sarit Dhanarajata executed a coup and installed Pote Sarasin as prime minister. ML Pin subsequently received "an offer he could not refuse" to join his cabinet as Minister of Education and of Culture. ML Pin was also included in the following cabinets of Thanom Kittikachorn and Sarit himself, with Sarit holding power as Thailand's strongman leader until his death, after which he was succeeded by Thanom. Sarit pushed for a revival of the monarchy's importance, which was aided by ML Pin's royalist ideals, and school textbooks were revised to feature the monarchy prominently. ML Pin served as Minister of Education until 1969, when general elections were held and the Prime Minister reshuffled cabinet, replacing the six most senior members. (The post of Minister of Culture was terminated in 1958.)
As Minister of Education, ML Pin established the Regional Education Development Project including Higher Education, which aimed to study the needs and limitations of education systems in the provinces. Spanning over two years, results of the project included the improvement of cooperation between government officials and Muslim locals in the four southernmost provinces, recognition of the need for children living near the Malay and Cambodian borders to be able to learn the Thai language before starting school, and the experimental development of a curriculum based on learners' needs and interests at Suranaree School.
As part of the project, ML Pin made preparations for the founding of Chiang Mai University, planning the campus and beginning construction, but the authority over the project was ultimately transferred to the Office of the Educational Council. He served three terms as President of Silpakorn University from 1965 to 1971, during which he founded the university's Sanam Chandra Palace Campus. There he intended to established a collegiate university system following that used at Oxford, as advised when he was Permanent Secretary of Education by Prime Minister Pibulsonggram, and Thap Kaew College was opened in 1968. However, the college system turned out to be unsuccessful, lacking support from both the student body and the government, and was dissolved.
At Thap Kaew, ML Pin also arranged for the construction of the Sound Library, a remotely-accessible on-demand audio collection. King Bhumibol Adulyadej donated recordings of his speeches to the library, and later remote access via radio from Bangkok was developed, but the library was not maintained after ML Pin's presidency ended and thus fell into disuse.
As minister, ML Pin also oversaw the construction of the Bangkok Planetarium, which opened in 1964, and of the new National Library building at Tha Vasukri, and the revival of the King's Scholarship, among other things. After his ministerial term ended in 1969, he served two terms as member of the Senate and another as a member of the National Legislation Assembly.
Later life.
ML Pin spent much of his retirement working on various tributes to King Vajiravudh, who had died while ML Pin was studying in England. In 1970 he began working with a few others with the intent to secure and catalogue the King's various literary works, some of which by then were at risk of disappearing from knowledge. He and the group made records of Dusit Thani, obtaining old photographs and other documentation, and organised a "guided tour" of Dusit Thani of old in November that year, which was presented to Princess Bejaratana, among others.
The group's work continued, and the Fine Arts Department established it into an official committee, with ML Pin as chairman, to make preparations for the 100th anniversary of the King's birth, which would be recognised by UNESCO. ML Pin lobbied for the construction of Vajiravudhanusorn Hall, a museum displaying the King's works and duties, at the National Library. The hall was opened in 1981, despite budget problems during construction, which ML Pin had to sell part of the property on Damrongrak Road to help fund.
The committee also conducted research on the Wild Tiger Corps, and determined the location in Photharam District, Ratchaburi Province, of Ban Rai, where King Vajiravudh often set up camp with them. ML Pin initiated the construction there of a statue of the King in Wild Tiger Corps uniform, which was unveiled in 1988, and the surrounding area was developed into Khai Luang Ban Rai scout camp, which also contains a medical station and kindergarten.
He was also a member of the Committee for the Renovation of Sanam Chandra Palace, but did not live to see the restoration completed.
ML Pin Malakul died on 5 October 1995, at the age of ninety-one.
Literary works.
During his years as Royal Page Student, ML Pin closely served King Vajiravudh and became learned in Thai literature. He was a prolific writer and produced a great number of literary works, including 25 compilations of poetic works, 57 works on education, 58 plays, 8 travel writings, and 56 other works. Among these are the following works in English:
Awards and recognition.
ML Pin was awarded the title of National Artist in Literature by the National Culture Commission in 1987 for his diverse contributions to the domain of Thai literature. He received the ASEAN Award in 1992 "for his outstanding achievements and contributions to literature". UNESCO celebrated the centenary of his birth in 2003, recognizing the value and impact of his contributions to the development of education in Thailand and Southeast Asia, and to the literary arts and the safeguarding and conservation of historical monuments and sites. On the occasion, Darakarn Building, the headquarters of UNESCO in Bangkok, was rededicated as the Mom Luang Pin Malakul Centenary 
Building, and Room 57, Building 1 at Triam Udom Suksa School, ML Pin's former office, was set up as an archive of his original works.
ML Pin received various decorations and medals, including the Orders of Chula Chom Klao, the White Elephant, the Crown of Thailand and Ramkeerati, and the Dushdi Mala, Border Service, Chakrabarti Mala, Royal Cypher, Red Cross Commendation and Red Cross Awards Medals. Foreign decorations he received include the West German Federal Cross of Merit, Belgian Order of Leopold, Japanese Order of the Sacred Treasure, South Korean Order of Diplomatic Service Merit and Republic of China Order of the Brilliant Star.
He received honorary degrees from Chulalongkorn, Indiana, Silpakorn, Srinakharinwirot, Chiang Mai and Ramkhamhaeng Universities. He also served as Fellow and Honorary Fellow in Literature of the Royal Institute of Thailand and Honorary Member of the Education Society of Thailand. He was awarded the Elder Teacher's Pin and named Exceptional Contributor to National Education by the Teacher's Council of Thailand, and received the Golden Phra Kiao for outstanding contributions to the Thai language from Chulalongkorn University.

Allied Capital

Allied Capital was a private equity investment firm and mezzanine capital lender providing debt and equity capital for leveraged buyouts, acquisitions and restructurings of established businesses. Allied operates as a Business Development Company, a form of publicly traded private equity company and is among the largest BDCs.
Allied invests primarily in middle-market companies in the business services, financial services, consumer products industrial, health care, retail and energy sectors.
The firm is headquartered in Washington, DC with offices in New York City.
History.
Allied Capital Corporation was founded in 1958 and completed its first public offering of stock in 1960 on the OTC. In 2001, Allied was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Allied's stock was repeatedly noted for a high dividend yield.
Allied and Short Sellers.
Between 2002 and 2008, David Einhorn, the manager of Greenlight Capital, a hedge fund engaged in heavy short selling of Allied's stock as he tried to demonstrate that the company's valuation of its illiquid securities was inflated. This activity led to a highly publicized feud between Einhorn and the company. 
As early as 2003, Allied complained publicly about Einhorn's activities. Einhorn's activities in relation to Allied were also examined by the SEC to determine whether his statements about the company were intended to manipulate its stock price.
In 2004, Allied came under scrutiny.
In June 2007, the S.E.C. found that Allied broke securities laws relating to the accounting and valuation of illiquid securities it held. However, it did not issue any fines or penalties, and Allied settled without admitting or denying the allegations.
In 2008, Einhorn authored "Fooling Some of the people All of the Time," describing his concerns about the company's accounting practices and his encounters with the company over those years. In 2008, Allied came under wider criticism for aggressive accounting policies.
The 2007-2009 Credit Crunch.
As the credit markets began to slow in 2007, Allied appeared to be unaffected. In January 2008, Allied completed a structured secondary transaction with Goldman Sachs. Goldman and Allied created AGILE Fund I, LLC, a new special purpose vehicle to acquire $170 million of private equity and mezzanine capital interests from Allied Capital, representing 13.7% of Allied’s equity portfolio. Goldman also agreed to invest $125 million in future investment vehicles managed by Allied. Allied also sold a portfolio of venture capital and private equity fund interests.
On September 30, 2008, Allied Capital shares fell by more than half their value as Ciena Capital, one of its portfolio companies, filed for bankruptcy.
Sale to Ares Capital.
In late 2009, Allied agreed to be purchased by Ares Capital. Prospect Capital submitted a competing bid in early 2010, but was rejected by Allied management. The sale to Ares was approved by shareholders on March 26, 2010, and was finalized on April 1 with Allied closing for the last time at $5 a share.

Papal election, 1159

The Papal election of 4–7 September 1159 followed the death of Pope Adrian IV. It resulted in a double election. A majority of the cardinals elected Cardinal Rolando of Siena as Pope Alexander III, but a minority refused to recognize him and elected their own candidate Ottaviano de Monticelli, who took the name Victor IV, creating a schism which lasted until 1178.
The schism was a result of the growing tensions inside the Sacred College of Cardinals concerning the foreign policy of the Holy See. The Papal states in 12th century were some kind of buffer between two European powers – the Holy Roman Empire and the Norman Kingdom of Sicily. In the period after Concordat of Worms in 1122 the Papacy was allied with Empire rather than with Normans, but during the pontificate of Adrian IV (1154–59) this alliance had broken up because Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa did not fulfil the terms of the treaty of Constance (1153) that obliged him to help the Papacy to restore its authority in Rome, ruled by the commune, and some other territories of the Papal Patrimony, which fell under the control of the king of Sicily. In these circumstances Adrian IV decided to break the alliance with Emperor and to make peace with William I of Sicily by signing the Treaty of Benevento (1156). In the following years there were growing tensions between the papacy and Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa (e.g. a dispute at the diet of Besançon in 1157). Frederick tried – with significant success – to strengthen his influence on the Church in Germany. The change of the direction of the papal foreign policy resulted with the division of the Sacred College into supporters and opponents of the new policy, who were unable to achieve a compromise after the death of Adrian IV.
The election of 1159 had also significant legal consequences. Up to that time, the election of the new Pope required unanimity among the electors, which led to the schism when the existence of factions in the Sacred College made the unanimity impossible. To avoid the schism in the future, Third Lateran Council in 1179 promulgated the decree "Licet de evitanda discordia", which established the rule that the Pope is elected with the majority of two thirds of the cardinals participating in the election.
Death of Adrian IV.
Pope Adrian IV died on 1 September 1159. Fearing a possible schism, shortly before his death he recommended to the cardinals the election of Cardinal Bernard of Porto as his successor.
List of participants.
There were thirty one cardinals in September 1159. One of them seem not to have participated in the election, leaving the number of thirty electors.:
Five electors were created by Pope Innocent II, two by Pope Celestine II, four by Pope Lucius II, eight by Pope Eugenius III and eleven by Pope Adrian IV.
Divisions in the Sacred College.
The College of Cardinals was divided into two factions: the so-called "Sicilian" party, led by chancellor Rolando of Siena and Camerlengo Boso; they supported pro-Sicilian policy of Adrian IV. The opposite Imperial faction was led by Ottaviano of S. Cecilia.
It is known that Sicilian party counted thirteen cardinals. They were chancellor Roland of S. Marco, camerlengo Boso of SS. Cosma e Damiano, cardinal-bishops Bernard of Porto, Ubaldo of Ostia, Walter of Albano and Gregorio of Sabina, as well as cardinals Odone of S. Giorgio, Ubaldo of S. Croce, Ottone of S. Nicola, Ardicio of S. Teodoro, Giovanni of S. Anastasia, Ildebrando of SS. Apostoli and Pietro of S. Eustachio.
The Imperial party may have counted as many as nine cardinals. but only six can be actually identified as its members: Ottaviano of S. Cecilia, Giovanni of SS. Silvestro e Martino, Guido of S. Maria in Trastevere, Imar of Tusculum, Raymond of S. Maria in Via Lata and Simeone of S. Maria in Domnica Guglielmo of S. Pietro in Vincoli was probably the seventh one. Perhaps Cardinal Cinzio of S. Adriano also belonged to this faction. The remaining ten cardinals were neutral.
It is believed that both factions made some preparations to the election in the last months of the pontificate of Adrian IV, although these attempts are known only from the hostile accounts produced for the polemical purposes during the subsequent schism and it is impossible to verify their factual accuracy. Both sides accused each other of illegal conspiracies. The adherents of Victor IV accused "Sicilians" of receiving the bribes from the king William I of Sicily and the anti-Imperial cities of Brescia, Milan and Piacenza. They ostensibly made an oath not to vote for any candidate outside their circle. On the other hand, "Sicilians" accused imperialists of hatching a plot with the imperial envoy Otto von Wittelsbach, who was present at Rome at the time of the election and gave the significant support to Victor IV in taking control over the Patrimony of St. Peter. It is known that the secular adherents of Cardinal Ottaviano de Monticelli, who was related to the powerful family of the counts of Tusculum, were prepared for the armed confrontation in Rome. Evidently, neither party was prepared for compromise.
Proceedings.
Election of Alexander III.
The cardinals assembled in the Vatican Basilica on 4 September, three days after the death of Adrian IV. They had decided that, according to the custom, the election should be unanimous to be valid. It’s seems that candidature of Bernard of Porto, recommended by Adrian as acceptable for both factions, had never been even advanced. Both parties put forward candidates mutually unacceptable: imperial party proposed Ottaviano de Monticelli, while "Sicilians" proposed chancellor Rolando. The cardinals discussed for three days without achieving a compromise. However, Sicilian party was able to join all the neutral cardinals and probably detached also some members of the imperial faction. On the fourth day (7 September), Cardinal Rolando of Siena was proclaimed pope by them and took the name Alexander III, although the unanimity had not been achieved and some cardinals still opposed his candidature. According to the manifest of Alexandrine party of October 1159 and an account of Cardinal Boso, on that day Rolando received the votes of all cardinals assembled except three – those of Ottaviano of S. Cecilia, Giovanni of SS. Silvestro e Martino and Guido of S. Maria in Trastevere. Then supporters of Rolando recognized that “It seemed inappropriate that ... the apostolic see ... should remain any longer without a ruler because of the contentiousness of the aforesaid men”. On the other hand, the opposite party claimed that Ottaviano had still nine votes, and that Sicilian party, having majority, simply broke the rule that required unanimity for the valid election. However, version of the imperial cardinals is believed to be less reliable than the version of the Alexandrine party, even if the latter may be also not fully accurate; basing on the subscriptions of the manifests of both parties issued shortly after the election it is possible to assume that at least twenty three electors voted for Rolando, and no more than six opposed him.
Election of Victor IV.
The electors of Cardinal Rolando, immediately after proclaiming him Pope, attempted to place upon him the purple mantle which symbolized the assumption of the papal office, but then the election entered the tumultuous stage. Cardinal Ottaviano Monticelli snatched the mantle from Alexander’s back and his armed bands burst into the basilica. Alexander III and his supporters fled to the citadel of St. Peter, which was in the hands of Cardinal Boso. In their absence, the few cardinals who remained in basilica elected Ottaviano of S. Cecilia to the papacy and enthroned him as Victor IV. The exact number of his electors is not known, but there are good reasons to believe that it amounted six, including Ottaviano himself, since only five cardinals signed the manifest in his favour in the following month. However, it is possible that some additional cardinals participated in the election of Victor IV but very quickly joined the obedience Alexander III.
Consecration of Alexander III.
Pope Alexander III remained in the citadel for a week until he was rescued and escorted from Rome by Odo Frangipane, and on September 18 he was eventually bestowed with the purple mantle. On 20 September at the small village of Ninfa, south-east of Velletri, he was consecrated bishop of Rome by Cardinal Ubaldo Allucingoli, bishop of Ostia e Velletri, and crowned by Cardinal Odone Bonecase, protodeacon of S. Giorgio in Velabro. On 27 September he excommunicated Victor IV and his adherents.
Consecration of Victor IV.
Victor IV was consecrated on 4 October in the abbey of Farfa by Cardinal-Bishop Imar of Tusculum, dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, assisted by the bishops Ubaldo of Ferentino and Riccardo of Melfi. With the armed assistance of Otto von Wittelsbach and his own armed groups in relatively short time he took control over the City of Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter, while Alexander III took refuge in the territory of the Kingdom of Sicily, and later in France.
Manifests of both factions in October 1159.
Both rivals together with their adherents defended the legality of their elections. In October 1159 cardinals of both obediences produced the manifests to the Emperor Frederick in favour of their elects. The “Alexandrine” manifest was subscribed by twenty three cardinals, while that of Victorine faction only by five. Supporters of Victor IV, admitting that they were in minority, justified their action by the fact that the opposite faction broke the rule of unanimity and – in consequence – the election of Rolando was invalid. The opposite party claimed that the principle of unanimity had been breached by the obstructive conduct of merely three cardinals of the Imperial faction, who stubbornly refused to recognize the candidate desired by the rest of the Sacred College.
Final division of the Sacred College of Cardinals in October 1159.
Simeone Borelli joined the obedience of Alexander III already at the end of 1159. Raymond of S. Maria in Vi Lata did the same between February and April 1160. Besides, at the end of 1159 Victor IV created at least three new cardinal-deacons: Bernard of SS. Sergio e Bacco, Giovanni of S Maria in Aquiro and Lando of S. Angelo, while Alexander III appointed on February 18, 1160 cardinal-deacon Milo of S. Maria in Aquiro.
Schism.
Both popes sent their legates to the catholic kingdoms in order to secure their recognition. At the council of Pavia in February 1160 Emperor Frederick I declared himself in favour of Victor IV, and the episcopate of the Empire followed him, with the significant exception of archbishop of Salzburg Eberhard I von Hilpolstein-Biburg and his suffragans. King Valdemar I of Denmark also gave his support to Victor IV, but the primate of Denmark archbishop Eskil of Lund became partisan of Alexander III. It seems that Poland also supported Victor IV. The rest of Europe, namely France, England, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Scotland, Hungary, Sicily and the Latin territories in Outremer, recognized Alexander III as true Pope, even if in some of these countries there were a significant Victorine minorities in episcopates or among feudal rulers. The papal schism in Europe was now a fact.
The unity of the Church had been restored only after eighteen years, when Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and Pope Alexander III signed a Treaty of Venice (1 August 1177); shortly thereafter the pro-imperial pope Callistus III (successor of Victor IV) abandoned his claims to the papacy and submitted to Alexander III (29 August 1178). Victor IV and his successors Paschal III (1164–68) and Callistus III (1168–78) are now regarded as antipopes by the Catholic Church, while Alexander III is recognized as legitimate successor of St. Peter the Apostle.
Aftermath.
The election of 1159 and the subsequent schism shows the necessity of amending the rules concerning papal elections. The decree "Licet de evitanda discordia" issued by the Third Lateran Council in 1179 abolished the rule of unanimity in favour of the rule of the majority of two thirds. The decree confirmed also that all three orders of the College of Cardinals (bishops, priests and deacons) are equal in the papal elections. Although the practice allowing the participation of cardinal-priests and cardinal-deacons on equal rights with cardinal-bishops had been introduced no later than in the papal election, 1118, the decree In Nomine Domini (1059) conferring the special electoral rights on the cardinal-bishops had never been formally revoked up to that time.

Letov Š-39

__NOTOC__
The Letov Š-39 was a sport aircraft produced in Czechoslovakia during the 1930s. It was a conventional, parasol-wing monoplane with fixed tailskid undercarriage, and seating for the pilot and passenger in tandem, open cockpits. Because the cabane struts were very short, and the wing therefore placed very close to the top of the fuselage, the cockpits had the unusual arrangement of the passenger's being in front of the wing while the pilot's was behind it. The outer half of each wing was fitted with fixed slats along the leading edge. An initial batch of 23 machines was built for use by Czech aeroclubs. These were followed by batches of aircraft with alternative powerplants.

Angel

An angel (from the Greek ἄγγελος - "ángelos") is a supernatural being or spirit, often depicted in humanoid form with feathered wings on their backs and halos around their heads, found in various religions and mythologies.
The theological study of angels is known as "angelology". In Zoroastrianism and Abrahamic religions they are often depicted as benevolent celestial beings who act as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits or a guiding influence.
The term "angel" has also been expanded to various notions of spirits found in many other religious traditions. Other roles of angels include protecting and guiding human beings, and carrying out God's tasks.
In art, angels are often depicted with bird-like wings on their back, a halo, robes and various forms of glowing light.
Etymology.
The word "angel" in English is a fusion of the Old English/Germanic word "engel" (with a hard g) and the Old French "angele". Both derive from the Latin "angelus" which in turn is the romanization of the ancient Greek ' ("ángelos"), "messenger", "envoy", which is related to the Greek verb ' ("angéllō"), meaning "bear a message, announce, bring news of" etc. The earliest form of the word is the Mycenaean "a-ke-ro" attested in Linear B syllabic script.<br>The "ángelos" is the default Septuagint’s rendition of the Biblical Hebrew term "mal’akh" denoting simply “messenger” without specifying its nature. In the Latin Vulgate however the meaning becomes bifurcated: when "mal’akh" or "ángelos" is supposed to denote a human messenger, words like "nuntius" or "legatus" are applied. If the word refers to some supernatural being – the word "angelus" appears. Such differentiation has been taken over by later vernacular translations of the Bible, early Christian and Jewish exegetes and eventually modern scholars.
Judaism.
The Bible uses the terms מלאך אלהים ("mal'āk̠ 'ĕlōhîm"; messenger of God), מלאך יהוה ("mal'āk̠ YHWH"; messenger of the Lord), בני אלהים ("bənē 'ĕlōhîm"; sons of God) and הקודשים ("haqqôd̠əšîm"; the holy ones) to refer to beings traditionally interpreted as angels. Later texts use other terms, such as העליונים ("hā'elyônîm"; the upper ones).
The term ("mal'āk̠") is also used in the Tanakh; a similar term, ("malā'ikah"), is used in the Qur'an. The Greek and Hebrew words, depending on the context may refer either to a human messenger or a supernatural messenger. The human messenger could possibly be a prophet or priest, such as Malachi, "my messenger", and the Greek superscription that the Book of Malachi was written "by the hand of his messenger" ἀγγέλου "angélou". Examples of a supernatural messenger are the "Malak YHWH," who is either a messenger from God, an aspect of God (such as the Logos), or God himself as the messenger (the "theophanic angel.")
Scholar Michael D. Coogan notes that it is only in the late books that the terms "come to mean the benevolent semidivine beings familiar from later mythology and art." Daniel is the first biblical figure to refer to individual angels by name, mentioning Gabriel (God's primary messenger) in Daniel 9:21 and Michael (the holy fighter) in Daniel 10:13. These angels are part of Daniel's apocalyptic visions and are an important part of all apocalyptic literature. Coogan explains the development of this concept of angels: "In the postexilic period, with the development of explicit monotheism, these divine beings—the 'sons of God' who were members of the Divine Council— were in effect demoted to what are now known as 'angels', understood as beings created by God, but immortal and thus superior to humans." This conception of angels is best understood in contrast to demons and is often thought to be "influenced by the ancient Persian religious tradition of Zoroastrianism, which viewed the world as a battleground between forces of good and forces of evil, between light and darkness." One of these is "hāšāṭān", a figure depicted in (among other places) the Book of Job.
Philo of Alexandria identifies the angel with the Logos as far as the angel is the immaterial voice of God. The angel is something different than God Himself, but is conceived as God's instrument.
In post-Biblical Judaism, certain angels took on particular significance and developed unique personalities and roles. Though these archangels were believed to rank among the heavenly host, no systematic hierarchy ever developed. Metatron is considered one of the highest of the angels in Merkabah and Kabbalist mysticism and often serves as a scribe; he is briefly mentioned in the Talmud and figures prominently in Merkabah mystical texts. Michael, who serves as a warrior and advocate for Israel (), is looked upon particularly fondly. Gabriel is mentioned in the Book of Daniel (), the Book of Tobit, and briefly in the Talmud, as well as in many Merkabah mystical texts. There is no evidence in Judaism for the worship of angels, but there is evidence for the invocation and sometimes even conjuration of angels.
Medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides explained his view of angels in his "Guide for the Perplexed" II:4 and II:6:
According to Kabalah, there are four worlds and our world is the last world: the world of action (Assiyah). Angels exist in the worlds above as a 'task' of God. They are an extension of God to produce effects in this world. After an angel has completed its task, it ceases to exist. The angel is in effect the task. This is derived from the book of Genesis when Abraham meets with three angels and Lot meets with two. The task of one of the angels was to inform Abraham of his coming child. The other two were to save Lot and to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.
Jewish angelic hierarchy.
Maimonides, in his "Yad ha-Chazakah: Yesodei ha-Torah", counts ten ranks of angels in the Jewish angelic hierarchy, beginning from the highest:
Individual angels.
From the Jewish Encyclopedia, entry "angelology".
"*Please note that these are the only two angels to be mentioned by name in the Hebrew Bible; the rest are from extra-biblical tradition."
Christianity.
Later Christians inherited Jewish understandings of angels, which in turn may have been partly inherited from the Egyptians.
By the late 4th century, the Church Fathers agreed that there were different categories of angels, with appropriate missions and activities assigned to them. There was, however, some disagreement regarding the nature of angels. Some argued that Angels had physical bodies, while some maintained that they were entirely spiritual. Some theologians had proposed that angels were not divine but on the level of immaterial beings subordinate to the Trinity. The resolution of this Trinitarian dispute included the development of doctrine about angels.
The angels are represented throughout the Christian Bible as spiritual beings intermediate between God and men: "You have made him (man) a little less than the angels ..." (). The Bible describes the function of angels as "messengers" but does not indicate when the creation of angels occurred. Some Christians believe that angels are created beings, based on (; ): "praise ye Him, all His angels: praise ye Him, all His hosts ... for He spoke and they were made. He commanded and they were created ...". The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) declared that the angels were created beings. The Council's decree "Firmiter credimus" (issued against the Albigenses) declared both that angels were created and that men were created after them. The First Vatican Council (1869) repeated this declaration in "Dei Filius", the "Dogmatic constitution on the Catholic faith". 
Thomas Aquinas (13th century) relates angels to Aristotle's metaphysics in his "Summa contra Gentiles", "Summa Theologica", and in "De substantiis separatis", a treatise on angelology. Although angels have greater knowledge than men, they are not omniscient, as Matthew 24:36 points out. 
Interaction with angels.
The New Testament includes many interactions and conversations between angels and humans. For instance, three separate cases of angelic interaction deal with the births of John the Baptist and Jesus Christ. In Luke 1:11, an angel appears to Zechariah to inform him that he will have a child despite his old age, thus proclaiming the birth of John the Baptist. And in Luke 1:26 the archangel Gabriel visits the Virgin Mary in the Annunciation to foretell the birth of Jesus Christ. Angels then proclaim the birth of Jesus in the Adoration of the shepherds in Luke 2:10. 
Angels appear later in the New Testament. According to Matthew 4:11, after Jesus spent forty days in the desert, "...the devil left him and, behold, angels came and ministered to him." In Luke 22:43 an angel comforts Jesus Christ during the Agony in the Garden. In Matthew 28:5 an angel speaks at the empty tomb, following the Resurrection of Jesus and the rolling back of the stone by angels. Hebrews 13:2 reminds the reader that they may "entertain angels unaware".
Since the completion of the New Testament, the Christian tradition has continued to include reported interactions with angels. For instance, in 1851 Pope Pius IX approved the Chaplet of Saint Michael based on the 1751 reported private revelation from archangel Michael to the Carmelite nun Antonia d'Astonac. And Pope John Paul II emphasized the role of angels in Catholic teachings in his 1986 address titled ""Angels Participate In History Of Salvation"", in which he suggested that modern mentality should come to see the importance of angels.
As recently as the 20th century, visionaries and mystics have reported interactions with angels. In a biography of Saint Gemma Galgani written by Venerable Germanus Ruoppolo, Galgani stated that she had spoken with her guardian angel. 
Latter Day Saints.
Adherents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (generally referred to as "Mormons") view angels as the messengers of God. They are sent to mankind to deliver messages, minister to humanity, teach doctrines of salvation, call mankind to repentance, give priesthood keys, save individuals in perilous times, and guide humankind.
Latter Day Saints believe that angels either are the spirits of humans who are deceased or who have yet to be born, or are humans who have been resurrected or translated and have physical bodies of flesh and bones, and accordingly Joseph Smith taught that "there are no angels who minister to this earth but those that do belong or have belonged to it." As such, Latter Day Saints also believe that Adam (the first man) is now the archangel Michael, and that Gabriel lived on the earth as Noah. Likewise the Angel Moroni first lived in a pre-Columbian American civilization as the 5th-century prophet-warrior named Moroni.
Joseph Smith, Jr. described his first angelic encounter thus:
Most angelic visitations in the early Latter Day Saint movement were witnessed by Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, who both claimed (prior to the establishment of the Church in 1830) to have been visited by the prophet Moroni, John the Baptist, and the Apostles Peter, James, and John. Later, at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, Smith and Oliver Cowdery claimed to have been visited by Jesus, and subsequently by Moses, Elias, and Elijah. 
People who claimed to have received a visit by an angel include the other two of the Three Witnesses: David Whitmer and Martin Harris. Many other Latter Day Saints, both in the early and modern church, have claimed to have seen angels, though Smith posited that, except in extenuating circumstances such as the restoration, mortals teach mortals, spirits teach spirits, and resurrected beings teach other resurrected beings.
Islam.
Angels (Arabic: ملائكة , "Malāʾikah") are mentioned many times in the Qur'an and Hadith. Islam is clear on the nature of angels in that they are messengers of God. They have no free will, and can do only what God orders them to do. An example of a task they carry out is that of testing individuals by granting them abundant wealth and curing their illness. Believing in angels is one of the six Articles of Faith in Islam.
Some examples of angels in Islam:
Bahá'í Faith.
In his "Book of Certitude" Bahá'u'lláh, founder of the Bahá'í Faith, describes angels as people who "have consumed, with the fire of the love of God, all human traits and limitations", and have "clothed themselves" with angelic attributes and have become "endowed with the attributes of the spiritual". 'Abdu'l-Bahá describes angels as the "confirmations of God and His celestial powers" and as "blessed beings who have severed all ties with this nether world" and "been released from the chains of self", and "revealers of God's abounding grace". The Bahá'í writings also refer to the Concourse on High, an angelic host, and the Maid of Heaven of Bahá'u'lláh's vision.
Neoplatonism.
In the commentaries of Proclus (4th century, under Christian rule) on the Timaeus of Plato, Proclus uses the terminology of "angelic" ("aggelikos") and "angel" ("aggelos") in relation to metaphysical beings. According to Aristotle, just as there is a First Mover, so, too, must there be spiritual secondary movers.
Zoroastrianism.
In Zoroastrianism there are different angel-like figures. For example, each person has one guardian angel, called Fravashi. They patronize human beings and other creatures, and also manifest God's energy. The Amesha Spentas have often been regarded as angels, although there is no direct reference to them conveying messages, but are rather emanations of Ahura Mazda ("Wise Lord", God); they initially appear in an abstract fashion and then later became personalized, associated with diverse aspects of the divine creation.
Sikhism.
Azrael (as Azraa-eel) is named as the angel of death in the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture and the final Guru of the Sikhs.
In So Dar and Raag Asa Sat Guru Nanak mentions Chitragupta as the angel who record the deeds of men.
Brahma Kumaris.
The Brahma Kumaris uses the term "angel" to refer to a perfect, or complete state of the human being, which they believe can be attained through a connection with God.
Theosophy.
In the teachings of Theosophy, "Devas" are regarded as living either in the atmospheres of the planets of the solar system ("Planetary Angels") or inside the Sun ("Solar Angels") and they help to guide the operation of the processes of nature such as the process of evolution and the growth of plants; their appearance is reputedly like colored flames about the size of a human. It is believed by Theosophists that devas can be observed when the third eye is activated. Some (but not most) devas originally incarnated as human beings.
It is believed by Theosophists that nature spirits, elementals (gnomes, undines, sylphs, and salamanders), and fairies can be also be observed when the third eye is activated. It is maintained by Theosophists that these less evolutionarily developed beings have never been previously incarnated as humans; they are regarded as being on a separate line of spiritual evolution called the "deva evolution"; eventually, as their souls advance as they reincarnate, it is believed they will incarnate as devas.
It is asserted by Theosophists that all of the above mentioned beings possess etheric bodies that are composed of "etheric matter", a type of matter finer and more pure that is composed of smaller particles than ordinary physical plane matter.
Hermetic Qabalah.
According to the Kabbalah as described by the Golden Dawn there are ten archangels, each commanding one of the choir of angels and corresponding to one of the Sephirot. It is similar to the Jewish angelic hierarchy.
Contemporary belief in angels.
A 2002 study based on interviews with 350 people, mainly in the UK, who said they have had an experience of an angel, describes several types of such experiences: visions, sometimes with multiple witnesses present; auditions, e.g. to convey a warning; a sense of being touched, pushed, or lifted, typically to avert a dangerous situation; and pleasant fragrance, generally in the context of somebody's death. In the visual experiences, the angels described appear in various forms, either the "classical" one (human countenance with wings), in the form of extraordinarily beautiful or radiant human beings, or as beings of light.
In the US, a 2008 survey by Baylor University's Institute for Studies of Religion, published by "TIME" magazine, which polled 1,700 respondents, found that 55 percent of Americans, including one in five of those who say they are not religious, believe that they have been protected by a guardian angel during their life. An August 2007 Pew poll found that 68 percent of Americans believe that "angels and demons are active in the world", and according to four different polls conducted in 2009, a greater percentage of Americans believe in angels (55%) than those who believe in global warming (36%).
According to the Gallup Youth Survey, in a "Teen Belief in the Supernatural" poll in 1994, 76% of 508 teenagers (aged 13–17) believe in angels, a greater percentage than those who believe in astrology, ESP, ghosts, witchcraft, clairvoyance, Bigfoot, and vampires. In 1978, 64% of American young people believed in angels; in 1984, 69% of teenagers believed in angels; and by 1994, that number grew to 76%, while belief in other supernatural concepts, such as the Loch Ness monster and ESP, has declined. In 1992, 80% of 502 surveyed teenage girls believe in angels, and 81% of Catholic teens and 82% of regular church attendees harbored beliefs in angels. According to another set of Gallup polls, designated towards all Americans, in 1994, 72% of Americans said they believed in angels, while in 2004, 78% of the surveyed Americans indicated belief in angels, with the percentage of Americans that did not believe in angels dropping from 15% to 10%, and the percentage of Americans that were "not sure" dropping from 13% to 11%.
A 2008 survey of over 1000 Canadians found 67 percent believe in angels.
Angels in art.
In an address during a General Audience of August 6, 1986, entitled "Angels participate in the history of salvation", Pope John Paul II explained that "he angels have no "body" (even if, in particular circumstances, they reveal themselves under visible forms because of their mission for the good of people)." Angels are however often depicted in painting and sculpture as male humans. Christian art perhaps reflects the descriptions in Revelation 4:6–8 of the Four Living Creatures () and the descriptions in the Hebrew Bible of cherubim and seraphim (the chayot in Ezekiel's Merkabah vision and the Seraphim of Isaiah). However, while cherubim and seraphim have wings in the Bible, no angel is mentioned as having wings.
The earliest known Christian image of an angel—in the "Cubicolo dell'Annunziazione" in the Catacomb of Priscilla (mid-3rd century)—is without wings. In that same period, representations of angels on sarcophagi, lamps and reliquaries also show them without wings, as for example the angel in the "Sacrifice of Isaac" scene in the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus (although the side view of the Sarcophagus shows winged angelic figures).
The earliest known representation of angels with wings is on the "Prince's Sarcophagus", discovered in the 1930s at Sarigüzel, near Istanbul, and attributed to the time of Theodosius I (379–395). From that period on, Christian art has represented angels mostly with wings, as in the cycle of mosaics in the Basilica of Saint Mary Major (432–440). Four- and six-winged angels, drawn from the higher grades of angels (especially cherubim and seraphim) and often showing only their faces and wings, are derived from Persian art and are usually shown only in heavenly contexts, as opposed to performing tasks on earth. They often appear in the pendentives of church domes or semi-domes. Prior to the Judeo-Christian tradition, in the Greek world the goddess Nike and the god Eros were also depicted in human-like form with wings.
Saint John Chrysostom explained the significance of angels' wings:
Angels are typically depicted in Mormon art as having no wings based on a quote from Joseph Smith ("An angel of God never has wings").
In terms of their clothing, angels, especially the Archangel Michael, were depicted as military-style agents of God and came to be shown wearing Late Antique military uniform. This uniform could be the normal military dress, with a tunic to about the knees, an armour breastplate and "pteruges", but was often the specific dress of the bodyguard of the Byzantine Emperor, with a long tunic and the "loros", the long gold and jewelled "pallium" restricted to the Imperial family and their closest guards. The basic military dress was shown in Western art into the Baroque period and beyond (see Reni picture above), and up to the present day in Eastern Orthodox icons. Other angels came to be conventionally depicted in long robes, and in the later Middle Ages they often wear the vestments of a deacon, a cope over a dalmatic; this costume was used especially for Gabriel in Annunciation scenes—for example the Annunciation in Washington by Jan van Eyck.

Aymeri de Narbonne

Aymeri de Narbonne is a legendary hero of Old French "chansons de geste" and the Matter of France. In the legendary material, as elaborated and expanded in various medieval texts, Aymeri is a knight in the time of Charlemagne's wars with the Saracens after the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. He is son of Hernaut and the grandson of Garin de Monglane. He conquers the city of Narbonne, marries a princess named Hermengarde or Hermenjart, and fathers seven sons (Guibert, Bernart, Guillaume, Garin, Hernaut, Beuve and Aymer), the most famous being Guillaume d'Orange, the hero of several popular "chansons de geste".
The "Aymeri" of the poems may be conflated with a later historic figure, Aimery II of Narbonne, who was the Viscount of Narbonne from around 1106 to 1134.
"Aymeri de Narbonne".
Aymeri de Narbonne is the hero of an eponymic early 13th century (c.1205-1225) "chanson de geste" (based on earlier poems) attributed to Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube (author, as well, of "Girart de Vienne" which "Aymeri de Narbonne" follows in four of the five extant manuscripts of this poem). The poem comprises 4,708 verses grouped into 122 rhymed laisses; the verses are all decasyllables except for a short six syllable line at the end of each laisse (a similar use of shorter lines appears in the "chansons de geste" "Aliscans" and the "Chanson de Guillaume"). In "Aymeri de Narbonne", Charlemagne, returning home from Spain after the tragic events of "The Song of Roland", comes upon the city of Narbonne and offers the city as a fief to whichever of his knights will conquer it, but all the knights refuse because of their despair, except for the young Aymeri. Once he becomes lord of the city, Aymeri seeks the hand of Hermengarde, sister of the king of the Lombards in Pavia. After various adventures, including difficulties with a German lord named Savari (to whom Hermengarde had been promised previously) and attacks from the Saracens, the marriage occurs. The poem ends with a prediction about their future children, seven boys and five girls. The poem was reworked into two prose versions in the 15th century. 
The Venise manuscript of "The Song of Roland" contains, after the end of that poem, a version of the tale of Aymeri taking Narbonne.
The character also appears in the "chanson de geste" "Girart de Vienne", also by Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube. In that poem, he incites his four uncles to war against the Emperor.
"Narbonnais".
The hero also appears in the "chanson de geste" entitled Narbonnais (c.1210) by an anonymous author from the Brie region. The poem comprises 8,063 decasyllable verses grouped into assonanced laisses. The manuscripts which contain the work all place it alongside other texts ("Aymeri de Narbonne", "Siège de Barbastre") and the title has lent itself to the entire cycle, called "the Narbonnais Cycle", which is itself often grouped with the "Cycle of Guilluame d'Orange" (itself part of the greater "Geste of Garin de Monglane"). "Narbonnais" was once considered to contain two distinct parts (before the critical edition of H. Suchier in 1898), and they have received their own titles: "Le Département des Enfanz Aymeri" ("The Departure of the Children of Aymeri") and "Le Siège de Narbonne" ("The Siege of Narbonne"). Linked to this text, there also exists a Latin prose fragment preserved at The Hague. A prose version of "Narbonnais" was made in the 15th century. The work was also adapted by the Italian Andrea da Barberino around 1410 for his prose version "Storie Nerbonesi". In the part on the departure of Aymeri's children: Aymeri sends six of his sons out to seek their own fiefs, while keeping the youngest son Guibert. The sons are successful and eventually come to the court of Charlemagne in Paris. In the part on the Siege of Narbonne: taking advantage of the departure of the sons, the Saracens attack Narbonne and nail Guibert to a cross. The youngest son is saved however, and races to the court to seek help, but he learns that Charlemagne has died, leaving his son Louis emperor. The seven sons and Louis' army eventually defeat the Saracens.
"Mort Aymeri".
Aymeri de Narbonne is also the hero of a (probable 13th century) "chanson de geste" entitled Mort Aymeri (de Narbonne) ("The Death of Aymeri"), also called "Les Sagittaires". The poem comprises 4,176 decasyllable verses grouped into assonanced and rhymed laisses. In this poem: at the end of his life, Aymeri battles to retake his city (he and his knights resort to dressing as women) and then must battle the Sagittaires, pagan centaurs, to save fourteen thousand maidens. In the end, Aymeri and two of his sons are mortally wounded and buried in Narbonne.

Girlguiding North West England

Girlguiding North West England is one of the nine Countries and Regions of Girlguiding UK. It is further subdivided into 17 Girlguiding Counties. These are not the same as the counties defined by the British government. The region was introduced in 1960 covering the Counties of Cumberland, Westmorland, Cheshire, Lancashire, plus the Isle of Man, with the headquarters in Preston. It is also known, for example to the Charity Commissioners, as the Guide Association North West England.
In 2010, Girlguiding Isle of Man was the largest voluntary youth organisation on the Island, with 1300 members.
Counties.
Girlguiding North West England is subdivided into 17 counties. These are:
History.
The "Lancaster Guardian" reported a meeting in Lancaster in September 1917 to co-ordinate "various troops and companies of Girl Guides". Lady Baden-Powell attended the meeting and gave an address. In this she explained the objects of the Guiding movement, with particular reference to the World War I, at that time in progress.
Centenary.
An exhibition was held at Gawthorpe Hall to coincide with the Girl Guides' centenary to celebrate the contribution of Rachel Kay-Shuttleworth. Rachel Kay-Shuttleworth was the first County Commissioner for the Girl Guides in Lancashire and contributed to the movement on a national level. The exhibition displayed many items not usually seen such as Kay-Shuttleworth's hand-drawn designs for banners, guide badges and samplers. Original guide uniforms, badges and standards were also displayed to tell the story of the association of Rachel Kay-Shuttleworth, Gawthorpe Hall and Guiding in Lancashire.
Ultimate Isle of Man Challenge.
One hundred Guides from around the UK walked one hundred miles around the Isle of Man's coast. The walk started on 21 August 2010. Manx Telecom donated SIM packs to the walkers enabling some of the participants to call home on their mobile phones to receive their GCSE exam results without incurring roaming charges.
Camp sites.
Waddow Hall Activity Centre is situated in this region in the Ribble Valley near Clitheroe. It has campsites, indoor accommodation, conference facilities, and equipment for a range of activities. It has been owned by Girlguiding UK since 1927 and is also used for training courses. The first training week at Waddow began on 28 September 1927, under the auspices of Alice Behrens, two days before the opening ceremony took place. Waddow is sometimes called the "Foxlease of the North".

John Deans Hope

John Deans Hope (8 May 1860 – 13 December 1949) was a Scottish Liberal politician.
Family and education.
Hope was born in Duddington, Midlothian, the son of the late James Hope of Eastbarns, Dunbar, a famous agriculturalist. In 1899 he married Elizabeth Holmes-Kerr whose father had homes in Glasgow and Underbank in Ayrshire. They had one daughter. His brother, Sir Harry Hope, 1st Baronet, was the Unionist MP for Buteshire. Hope was educated at Fettes College and Edinburgh University.
Career.
By profession Hope was a chartered accountant and later became a stockbroker. Hope was also a Justice of the Peace in Haddingtonshire.
Politics.
Hope first stood for Parliament at West Perthshire at the 1895 general election but could not remove the sitting Liberal Unionist MP Sir Donald Currie. 
However he was successful in being returned as Liberal MP for West Fife in succession to Augustine Birrell in the Khaki election of 1900
and he held the seat until the general election of December 1910 when he lost to the Labour candidate William Adamson the Secretary of the Fife Miners’ Association.
Return to Parliament.
Hope did not have long to wait before getting the chance to return to Parliament as in 1911 the MP for Haddingtonshire, Richard Haldane, was made a Viscount and went to the House of Lords and Hope was chosen by the local Liberals to succeed him. In the by-election that followed Hope emerged the winner with 3,652 votes to the 3,184 of the Unionist candidate B Hall Blyth – a respectable majority of 468 (albeit a decrease on the last election of over 200). 
In his victory speech at Haddington Assembly Rooms, Hope said that East Lothian had been true to the cause of freedom, liberty and justice and had given a decisive verdict against the veto of the House of Lords (a reference to the ongoing struggle originating with the People's Budget of 1909 and the Parliament Act 1911. The result, claimed Hope, would strengthen the government against the forces of privilege and obstruction. It was a victory for self-government for Ireland, Home Rule for Scotland and reform of land law.
Haddingtonshire constituency was abolished in 1918 and Hope was adopted for one of its successor constituencies Berwick and Haddington. Hope was a supporter of the coalition government of Lloyd George Liberals and the Conservatives and he received the infamous government ‘Coupon’ at the 1918 general election, standing as a Coalition Liberal against Labour and Independent Liberal opposition.
Out of Parliament.
At the 1922 general election both the local Conservative and Lloyd George Liberal Associations repudiated Hope as their candidate on the grounds that he had not made a single speech during his 24 years in Parliament. He had not been completely anonymous however having served on ten Parliamentary Commissions and having seconded a number of resolutions, apparently without ever being called upon to speak. Arthur Balfour wrote Hope a letter of support under the impression he was still Lloyd George’s nominee but he later retracted it. In the election Hope supported Bonar Law as an Independent Lloyd Georgian but there was also an official Lloyd George candidate, Major Walter Waring and an Asquithian, Mr H Pringle as well as R Spence for Labour. 
It was the end of Hope’s Parliamentary career as Waring won the contest.

After leaving high school, he began life as a reporter and then worked for a while as a theater press agent. This led to his writing a play, "The Fatted Calf" (1912) and to producing a show, "Poor Little Rich Girl", in 1913; it was a hit and launched his Broadway career. During the following 34 years he produced or directed 80 plays. He was one of Broadway's most admired producers with credits for "What Price Glory", "Anna Christie," and others. He directed plays by playwrights in American Expressionist theater, including Elmer Rice, Sophie Treadwell, and Eugene O'Neill.

He directed Philip Barry's 1928 play "Holiday" at the Plymouth Theatre, where it ran for 229 performances. His last production – "The Magnificent Yankee", based on the life of the Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr, in 1946 – was another hit. He is less known for starring Humphrey Bogart in his first main role in The Petrified Forest, which also was made into a movie with Humphrey Bogart.
He married the Australian actress Eva MacDonald in August 1915. At the time she declared that she had retired from the stage, but in 1919 she appeared as Natasha in "Night Lodging", produced by Hopkins. She died in 1938.

George H. Coes

George H. Coes (1828 – March 16, 1897) was an American minstrel music performer. He appeared in numerous minstrel shows in California and throughout the Northeastern United States.
Early life.
Coes was born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1828.
Career in minstrelsy.
Minstrelsy was America's first original contribution to the theater arts. It was popular from just before the American Civil War to the end of the 19th Century. Today, minstrelsy and its attendant blackface is viewed as racist and anachronistic; however, it was the preeminent entertainment in the United States during the life of George H. Coes, and he was one of the most well-known and successful performers.
Early career.
Coes went to California in 1852 and was associated with a number of minstrel acts, principally in San Francisco before returning East and opening with Woods and Christy's Minstrels in New York City in 1857. In 1858, Coes returned to California and joined with Sam Wells to form Coes and Wells' Minstrels. That partnership did not last and Coes returned to performing in other companies. In 1867, after years of performing in the minstrel companies of others, Coes joined with S.S. Purdy and Frank Converse to form Coes, Purdy and Converse's Party which opened in Harlem on March 19, 1867.
Partnership with Schoolcraft.
Coes joined with his old friend Luke Schoolcraft in 1874 and they formed "one of the most famous minstrel tandems in history." Schoolcraft & Coes appeared with a number of leading companies including Emerson's Megatherian Minstrels and Barlow, Wilson, Primrose & West. By 1880, the two settled with their families in Cambridge, Massachusetts and continued to tour throughout the country performing their minstrel act in a variety of shows and venues.
When Coes was unable to continue his career due to poor health in 1889, the partnership dissolved. Coes was stricken with paralysis in 1891 and died at his home at 205 Hampshire Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts on March 16, 1897.
Compositions.
George H. Coes produced a book of music in 1877, entitled George Coes' Album of Music which included a number of hits, including:

Anton Lehár

Anton Freiherr von Lehár (21 February 1876 – 12 November 1962; known sometimes as "Baron Antal Lehár") was an Austrian officer of Hungarian descent, who reached the pinnacle of his service after World War I when he supported the former Emperor Charles I of Austria's attempts to retake the throne of Hungary. His brother was composer Franz Lehár.
Early life.
Lehár was born in Ödenburg, (now Sopron), Austria-Hungary, as the younger son of a bandmaster in the Infantry Regiment No. 50 of the Austro-Hungarian Army. He attended schools in Preßburg, Prague and Vienna. He entered cadet school in Vienna to become a professional officer, finishing in 1893 top of his class. Following a posting to his father's regiment, he was promoted Leutnant in 1894 and Oberleutnant in 1898. Between 1897 and 1899 Lehár attended the "Kriegsschule" (war college) in Vienna, after which he was attached to the general staff and served in a number of training positions until World War I.
World War I.
Following the outbreak of World War I, Lehár, now with the rank of Major, was put in command of the 2nd battalion of the Honvéd-Landsturm Infantry Regiment No. 13, which he led in September 1914 during battles at Chodel south of Lublin. His battalion was part of the Army group "Kummer" and served next to the unit of General Viktor Dankl. For his conduct there, Lehár would later be decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa (see below). While still fighting near Lublin, Lehár was severely wounded.
After leaving hospital he was reassigned to the War ministry in Vienna and in September 1915 he served in the Tyrolean Defence Command. Following promotion to Oberstleutnant in September 1915, Lehár returned to fighting, this time on the Italian front. There he commanded the" Heeresgruppe "Lehar"" in the Etschtal-Rovereto sector of the Italian front, which consisted of Tyrolese "Standschützen" and Bosniaks. In June 1916 he was transferred back to the technical Military committee and became head of the department for infantry and cavalry weapons. Assignments to the Eastern front and to the office of Hermann Kövess von Kövessháza followed. Later he was transferred to the newly raised Infantry Regiment 106 and commanded this unit in the battles on the Piave. He served in the Infantry Regiment 106 until the end of the war. In May 1918 he was promoted to Oberst and received the Golden Bravery Medal for Officers.
In August 1918 Lehár was decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa in recognition of his services during the battles at Chodel south of Lublin in September 1914. In accordance with the statutes of this order, Lehár became a baron in his country's nobility and was since styled "Freiherr von Lehár", while his brother Franz remained a commoner.
At the conclusion of hostilities of World War I, Lehár was able to move his regiment, without any casualties or desertion, back to Steinamanger (now Szombathely in Hungary).
Hungary.
After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Oberst Anton Freiherr von Lehár decided to remain in Hungary and to fight for the monarchy, again in numerous roles and at various theatres of war. He played an important role in the counterrevolution in Hungary. In August 1919 he became the military commander of Western Hungary and was promoted to Major General by Regent Miklós Horthy.
When the former King King Charles IV tried to return to the Hungarian throne, Lehár joined his troops, but the mission failed. While the former monarch was transported into exile, Lehár escaped from Hungary and fled through Czechoslovakia to Germany where he hid with friends of his brother's.
Life as a businessman.
When the political turmoil had calmed down, Anton's brother Franz Lehár organized for the former general a job as director of the "Society of Authors, Composers and Music Publishers" in Berlin in 1926. With the rise of the National Socialist Party, Freiherr von Lehár was, as a dedicated Austrian-Hungarian monarchist, soon considered suspect. When the National Socialists assumed power in 1933 ("Machtergreifung"), he had to leave Berlin.
Back in Vienna, Lehár founded the "Chodel Music Publishing Company", but after it did not prosper, he decided to hand over the business to his brother in 1935. He then moved to the countryside, becoming a farmer in Theresienfeld near Wiener Neustadt in Lower Austria. When Germany occupied Austria in March 1938 ("Anschluss"), Lehár was ordered to move to Vienna where the Gestapo could keep a closer eye on him and his wife for much of World War II.
After Franz Lehár's death in October 1948, the former general became the administrator of his estate and spent the rest of his life guarding the rights and promoting the popularity of his brother's music.
Anton Freiherr von Lehár died in Vienna in 1962, aged 86.

West Tyrone (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)

West Tyrone was a constituency of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.
Boundaries.
West Tyrone was a county constituency comprising the western part of County Tyrone. It was created when the House of Commons (Method of Voting and Redistribution of Seats) Act (Northern Ireland) 1929 introduced first-past-the-post elections throughout Northern Ireland. North Tyrone was created by the division of Fermanagh and Tyrone into eight new constituencies, of which five were in County Tyrone. The constituency survived unchanged, returning one member of Parliament until the Parliament of Northern Ireland was temporarily suspended in 1972, and then formally abolished in 1973.
The seat was dominated by the town of Omagh, and also included parts of the rural districts of Castlederg and Omagh.
Politics.
The constituency was consistently won by members of the Nationalist Party. Members of the Ulster Unionist Party contested the seat on three occasions, twice winning more than 40% of the vote each time. The remaining elections were uncontested.
Election results.
At the 1929, 1933, 1938 and 1945 Northern Ireland general elections, Alex Donnelly was elected unopposed.
At the Northern Ireland general election, 1953, Roderick O'Connor was elected unopposed.
At the 1962, 1965 and 1969 Northern Ireland general elections, Roderick O'Connor was elected unopposed.

Hann, Senegal

Hann is a neighbourhood of Dakar, the capital of Senegal. It is located on the eastern side of the small south facing peninsula on which the old city of Dakar built. Hann neighborhood sits along a crescent shaped beach called Hann Bay. Hann is part of the Hann Bel-Air commune d'arrondissement: a part of the municipal Dakar Department which covers the city of Dakar.
Neighbourhood.
Hann sits just north of the Bel-Air peninsula, a rocky outcropping which juts east from the Dakar Plateau. To the south is the Port of Dakar. To the west is the HLM and Grand Yoff neighbourhoods. To the north is Patte d'Oie and to the northeast, Niayes. Gently sloping from the higher plateau of the city centre, Hann forms a long crescent sand beach, also known as "Yarakh".
Among the landmarks of Hann is the large park Parc Forestier de Hann, laying just northeast of the Dakar city center, the Parc Zoologique de Hann, and Cours Sainte Marie de Hann private school. The area, once a fishing village still is a launching point for the pirogues of local fishermen, is today dominated by large industrial development.
Environmental damage.
Hann Bay sits just north of the industrial area of the Port of Dakar. Once a small fishing village, Hann beach became a local beauty spot near the centre of Dakar. By the beginning of the 21st century, 71 factories discharging industrial effluent along the Hann shore had given the area the nickname "Trash Bay." In January 2009, the Senegalese government announced a €50m loan from France and the European Investment Bank to fund a Senegalese National Office for Decontamination (ONAS) project to clean up Hann Bay. It would be Senegal's first large scale industrial cleanup project. The plan will clean the area and create an industrial canal to divert effluent to a new waste treatment plant.
Transport.
Since 2006, the terminus of the Dakar–Niger Railway has been cut back to Hann.

Wei Te-Sheng

Wei Te-Sheng (; b. August 16, 1969 in Yongkang City, Tainan County (now part of Tainan City), Taiwan) is the director of "Cape No. 7", the second highest grossing film in Taiwanese history.
Early life.
Wei was born and raised in Tainan. His family ran a clockmaker's shop and attended a Presbyterian church.
He spent his childhood in the Yongkang District. According to an interview, Wei watched Taiwanese films "in old, small cinema halls and at an outdoor theater near where he lived." Wei said "It was a bit like "Cinema Paradiso"". The first Hollywood film Wei watched was Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in America" while Wei was doing his military service.
Career.
Wei studied electrical engineering in Far Eastern Vocational School (Today's Far East University) in Tainan. In 1993 or 1994 when Wei was 26, he entered the studio of director Edward Yang as a grip assistant. Later he became an assistant director on Yang's movie "Mahjong" (1996). Later Wei worked odd jobs to fund the his own short films, including "Three Dialogues" (1996) and "Before Dawn" (1997), which both won a Golden Harvest Award. In an interview Wei said that Yang "taught me to be a perfectionist and not sacrifice one's vision, even on a tight budget . . . . He also told me to use my own life experience and not copy anybody." Wei also said "Having mundane jobs that didn't require me to think allowed me to concentrate on my films in the evening".
In 1999, Wei's drama "About July", won "a special mention at the Alcan Dragons and Tigers Award for Young Cinema at the Vancouver International Film Festival." 
He later worked on Chen Kuo-fu's movie, "Double Vision" in 2002. "Double Vision" is one of Columbia Pictures' attempts to make Asian films at the time. On this film Wei worked as an assistant director and worked with producer Jimmy Huang. Their collaboration was important to Wei's career, as Huang would later produce Wei's "Cape No. 7" and "Seediq Bale". In addition, the big international investment, technology and effects employed by the film impressed Wei to pursue big-budget filmmaking.
"Cape No. 7".
Since 1996, Wei had been trying to make the war epic "Seediq Bale," but he could not raise the funds. "Double Vision's" director, Chen Kuo-fu, suggested that he make a film that could win the people's trust. In July 2004, Wei read about a Yunlin postman who successfully delivered a piece of mail addressed in the old Japanese style. Wei decided to make the film, "Cape No. 7," based on this story, in the hopes of financing "Seediq Bale." Wei finished the script by the end of 2006, and filmed it in the fall of 2007 in Hengchun Peninsula of Pingtung County.
As the production went over budget, Wei had problems securing additional capital; he subsequently refinanced his home and put his family NTD 30 million (nearly USD 900,000) in debt before the release. During filming Wei could barely afford the film rolls and lodging for the crew. Wei later said this film's zealous reception should help him manage his debts.
Wei believed "that the films that hit the screens before the end of summer vacation in 2007 were all 'safe bets'", because they avoided competition from Hollywood blockbusters. Wei followed this theory when he released "Cape No. 7" in 2008. Besides, Wei focused on the promotion of the film. The film was released in August, 2008. It eventually became the 2nd top-selling film in Taiwan history.
Teng Sue-feng points out that Wei got 30% of the profit of "Cape No. 7" ("about NT$140 million"). Also, "Cape No. 7" earned Wei a subsidy of about NTD 100 million from Government Information Office.
"Seediq Bale".
"Seediq Bale" was released in 2011, but Wei began to work on the film much earlier. According to an interview, Wei got the idea to make the film "Seediq Bale" in 1996 when he saw a protest demanding land to be returned to Taiwanese aborigines. Wei began to study history relevant to the aborigines and decided to make a film about chief Mona Rudao.
In late 2003, Wei raised NTD 2.5 million and shot a five-minute demonstration film in order to further raise NTD 300 million (USD 10 million) to shoot the complete film. The fundraising failed, and director Chen Kuo-fu advised Wei to make another film to win the trust of investors, so Wei turned his attention to make "Cape No. 7".
After the success of "Cape No. 7" in 2008 Wei returned to work on "Seediq Bale." However in 2009 Typhoon Morakot destroyed the set, and the cost grew from NTD 200 million to NTD 600 million. Aside from technical problems, Wei said that he had to direct the film and raise the money at the same time, and the company often ran out of money. Wei said this made him nervous and grouchy, and he had to rely on the patience of the family and employees.
The film was released in September 2011, both locally and internationally.
Personal life.
Wei is married and has one son.

Keane Wonder Mine

The Keane Wonder Mine and mill is an abandoned mining facility located within Death Valley National Park in Inyo County, California. It is located in the Funeral Mountains east of Death Valley and Furnace Creek, California
History.
The mine was dug during the early 1900s Death valley mining boom. Neighboring mines with names like Skidoo, California and Rhyolite, Nevada competed to pull as much gold out of the ground as possible. This boom slowed as a result of the Panic of 1907 and paused when the area was designated a National Monument by President Herbert Hoover. But mining in the valley did not stop completely until an increasing series of government interventions eventually resulted in Death Valley's 1994 designation as a National Park.
The location was discovered by a miner named Jack Keane. Keane and a partner named Domingo Etcharren had scouted the area, called Chloride Cliffs, and had located a potential silver mine. Etcharren eventually left while Keane stayed behind to scout the area more thoroughly. As Etcharren was leaving he noticed an outcropping of quartz, which can often be found near gold deposits. When Keane investigated further, he discovered gold. Keane named the find 'Keane's Wonder' and the two miners quickly sold an option on the claim to a New Yorker named Joseph DeLamar. 
The discovery caused a brief gold rush which was soon eclipsed by a larger find further north. DeLamar was disappointed with the gold his employees found and forfeited the option. This happened with a second investor as well. It was not until 1906 when investors John Campbell and then Homer Wilson turned the find into a major mine. The mine turned out to be a profitable operation. Etcharren used his share to purchase a store, while Keane was later involved in two shootings and was imprisoned in Ireland for murder.
Homer Wilson moved to the mine site with his family, and created two towns in the area called Keane Springs and Chloride City, California. Both towns failed within months of their founding in April, 1906. Despite the failure of the towns, the mine continued to be profitable throughout the Panic of 1907 and the subsequent depression. It was limited only by a lack of water and the extremely high heat in the valley, which forced Wilson to have the miners work at night. The mine's aerial tram became an attraction, and a railroad was briefly built in the area to connect with the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad. However, the mine was embroiled in a long legal controversy after a financial maneuver involving the failed State Bank and Trust Company of Nevada. The mine had largely been tapped out by 1912, and it was closed that year after being sold.
Visiting.
The Keane Wonder Mine was among the most successful gold mines in the valley, and followed the course of a rich vein of ore. The miners attempted to remove as much of the ore as possible, and as a result dug out large areas with only a few pillars to keep the mine from collapsing. This has led to the instability of both the mine and the land above it, and has led the National Park Service to close the area to visitors.. 
The presence of toxic chemicals such as lead and mercury which are by-products of processing., and the detection of cyanide, which was used to process gold ore, added to the park closing the mine area.
In addition to the mine itself, a gravity powered aerial tramway and a Stamp mill were built on the site. Both of these structures were popular with tourists but have suffered from neglect and the National Park Service has closed them pending restoration.

"Freedom" is the two-part fourth-season season finale of the serial drama television series "Grey's Anatomy", consisting of the sixteenth and seventeenth episode of the season, the 77th and 78th episodes in the overall series. The installment aired on May 22, 2008 on the American Broadcasting Company, in a two-hour special, which attracted 18.09 million American viewers. Both episodes were written by series creator and executive producer Shonda Rhimes, and directed by filmmaker and executive producer Rob Corn. Writing for "IGN Entertainment", Laura Burrows expressed a positive outlook on the episode, elaborating "As a whole the season finale was satisfying. It wrapped up the loose ends and gave us some food for thought while the show is on its summer hiatus. Shepherd and Meredith are finally going to drink that champagne, Callie has finally come to grips with her sexuality, Sloan is still a man-whore, but at least is willing to share the love and Izzie and Karev are finally going to overcome the Eva/Rebecca hurdle. Debbie Chang of BuddyTV noting the show "seemed to have lost its luster" since the third season, called it the "best episode of the entire season" which was "pitch perfect in almost every conceivable way"; yet she disliked Derek's immaturity.

The Book of Time (novel series)

"The Book of Time", originally released as "Le Livre du Temps", is a French children's fantasy novel trilogy written by Guillaume Prévost and first published in France by Gallimard Jeunesse. The first book of the series, "La Pierre Sculptée", was released in February 2006; the final book was released in November 2008. The trilogy follows fourteen-year-old Sam Faulkner as he travels through time and around the world via a strange statue and some unusual coins with holes in them to find his missing father.
Prévost created the series to help children see how history could be fascinating, basing the central characters on his own children. Scholastic Corporation licensed the series for an English language release in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Translated by William Rodarmor, the first novel was released simultaneously in all three countries under the name "The Book of Time" in 2007; the final English volume released in 2009
The series received mixed reviews from critics, with the first book in particular being heavily criticized for lacking depth and for its undeveloped characters. The second novel was better received with reviewers finding it action-packed and praising its conclusion, but noting that it lacked originality.
Plot.
After 14-year-old Sam Faulkner's mother Elisa died in a car accident, his father Allan opens the "Faulkner Antiquarian Bookstore" and moves himself into it while Sam lives with his grandmother, grandfather, his aunt and his aunt's boyfriend and cousin Lily. Then his father vanishes. Sam waits for him to come home, but more than a week passes without a trace. He goes to the bookstore to search for clues. In a room he'd never seen before, he finds a strange red book called "Crimes and Punishment During the Reign of Vlad Tepes", a stone statue with an odd circular indentation in it and a dusty coin with unreadable symbols. Curious, he fits the coin into the statue, and finds himself transported back to a strange island called Iona. He travels to a village there, where he finds another coin. Fitting it into the statue, he is transported again, this time to 800 AD to a Viking village in Scotland. As he finds other coins, he goes to other places, including France during World War I and ancient Egypt where he finds a large cache of the coins. Eventually, with help from his cousin Lily, he is able to transport back home. Together, they learn more about the time-traveling statue and a man named Vlad Tepes, the inspiration behind the Dracula legends, who they believe is holding Allan in fifteenth century Wallachia.
Sam and Lily begin searching for a way to reach him, but they are unable to control where the coins take Sam when he uses them. As the series progresses, Sam learns that he will need seven special coins to go to rescue his father. The effort to collect them takes him through a variety of historical locations and events. With the coins collected, he is finally able to rescue his father, only to find him dying and raving. Eventually he realizes his father wants to use the statue to prevent Elisa's death three years ago. Sam uses the coins to try to reach her, being taken through more historical events, as well as to the future where he sees his own grave.
Creation and conception.
When interviewed by "Children's Literature", author Guillaume Prévost shared that he created the series to help children understand that history could be fascinating and that he strove to be as accurate as possible with the historical backdrop. In discussing the series and his motivations, Prévost explained that he had begun by writing historical novels for adults but felt constrained by the "rules of the genre". Wishing to give greater freedom to his own imagination, he decided to create a juvenile series that would be both entertaining and educational. Being himself a teacher, he bemoaned the fact that (at the time of the interview) the French national education system did not allow use of the book in classrooms, as he felt that there can be a theatrical side to instruction and that the "spoken word can be as evocative as the written one". He explained that when speaking with his own students, he emphasizes the "human side of history" in that even when studying ancient events, one can make comparisons between historical figures and ourselves to find similarities, an approach he uses in the book series. 
He then shared that he has a son and daughter who have many of the same qualities of the series protagonists Sam and his cousin Lily, and also shared that he and Sam have many similar traits, such as judo, video games, computers and rock & roll. So he is able in the series to address that 14-year-old he still finds inside himself in order to connect with his readership. As a youth, he was strongly influenced by what he had read, and gives fond credit to works by authors such as Jules Verne, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, Maurice Leblanc, and Gaston Leroux as being instrumental in how he now builds his plots. He also credits his love of science fiction as being another strong influence, and credits such authors as Isaac Asimov, A. E. van Vogt, and Jack Vance as guiding his imagination and allowing him to take stories beyond the purely rational. Summing up his influences, he granted that it was these authors, as well as his intense interest in history, that inspired the stories to appeal to the child he once was. 
Speaking toward the difficulties that might have been encountered in creating translations of his works from French to English, he explained that his prior relationships with translators had always been very limited, and that this changed with his introduction to William Rodarmor. He admits that Rodarmor showed as much enthusiasm for his works as he did himself, with Rodarmor wanting to know even small details of plot and story so as to create a more accurate translation of the ideas of the stories beyond a simple translation of word by word.
Reception.
"Publishers Weekly'"s reviewer felt that "The Book of Time" was a "book-long prelude to a much longer story", praising Prévost's ability to efficiently and rapidly set up the story locations. Timothy Capehart of Voya agreed that it was obvious the first book was the start of a longer story, feeling it had no character development with a "tacked on" subplot. He also notes that the teenage characters "often speak with a stilted formality" and awkward phrasing, but was unsure if the translation or the original was to blame. Margaret K. McElderry of the "School Library Journal" felt readers would "feel cheated" by the ending of the first book as it answers no questions. Kirkus Reviews notes that the story is written "in short, almost jerky vignettes" and lacks depth in plot and character development due to its being the first book of the series. Andrea Sisco of "Armchair Interviews" praised the first volume, feeling the time-travel elements were fun, though noting there were too many in the first volume.
In reviewing the second book of the series, "The Gate of Days", Keri Collins Lewis of "Children's Literature Comprehensive Database" praised the book for building on the first and building up to the third while having "its own unique story line" and being "action-packed". Cara Chancellor of "KLIATT" found it to be "lively and captivating" with a "stunning conclusion" that makes up for its lack of originality. Kirkus Reviews felt the series concept as a whole was solid, but feels its "execution is sparse, rough, erratic and uneasily similar to the sensation of skating on thin ice". It panned the second volume as well, hoping the final book would have writing to better "live up to the premise."

Girlguiding South West England

Girlguiding South West England is one of the nine Countries and Regions of Girlguiding UK. It is further subdivided into 16 Girlguiding Counties and Islands. These are generally not the same as the counties defined by the British government, and in this Region, two of the Islands, Guernsey and Jersey, are not even part of the United Kingdom.
The regional Headquarters is St Ann's Manor in Salisbury, Wiltshire.
Counties.
Girlguiding South West England is subdivided into 16 Counties and Islands. These are:
History.
A letter survives from 1908, addressed to Lord Baden-Powell from May Jones in Brislington, asking him whether she can start a Girl Scout patrol. The encouraging reply is also extant. A year later the Brislington Girl Scout Owl Patrol was formed.
Guiding started on the Island of Jersey in 1919 with the formation of three Companies and its history is extensively documented.
Guiding in Plymouth was started by Lady Nancy Astor in 1917. She was "perturbed at the fact that several flourishing Guide units existed in Exeter and other parts of the County while Plymouth had none." She called a meeting of prominent people, especially those already involved in girls' organisations. Astor was appointed Divisional Commissioner and Mrs Palliser Hickman (the garrison commander's wife) was elected chairwoman of the local association. By July 1917 over 4000 girls had signed up.
Channel Islands in World War II.
The Channel Islands were occupied by Germany between 1941 and 1945. Official meetings were banned, but Guiding continued under cover. On Jersey, three Companies, the 5th St. Marks, 10th St. Aubin and 12th Gorey continued to meet at the homes of their Guiders. Miss Grace Le Roux, Captain of the 5th St Mark's Girl Guides received the Gilt Cross for her work for Guiding during the occupation.
Camp sites.
Foxlease, the national Girlguiding UK training and activity centre near Lyndhurst, Hampshire, is in this region.
Centenary.
Both Jersey and Guernsey issued postage stamps honouring the Guides' centenary in 2010. 
Bath and District Gang Show.
Bath Gang Show website
The Bath and District Gang Show was started in 1997, and generally has a cast of about 60 Scouts and Guides. Cast only have to audition for solos, duets and sketches and any member of the Scouts or Guides prepared to give the required commitment to the show can take part. The show takes place each year at the Kingswood School Theatre, in Lansdown, Bath. In 2004, the Gang Show were awarded the Gang Show Emblem. In 2008 the show was awarded the NODA's Stage Electric's award for technical achievement. In November 2009 they performed at the Bath Male Choir concert at the Bath Forum. In December 2008 and 2009, they staged 'A Christmas Carol' and 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' at the Rondo Theatre, Bath. Members of the team also production manage events at various international jamborees.
2012 marks their 15th Anniversary and plans are in place to stage a celebration production from the 6th - 10th June to make these celebrations as well as a Christmas show at the Rondo in December 2012.

"Losing My Mind" is the fifteenth episode of the fourth season of the American television medical drama "Grey's Anatomy", and the 76th episode of the overall series. It premiered on May 15, 2008. Written by series co-producer Debora Cahn, and directed by filmmaker James Frawley, the episode was viewed by 15.55 million Americans. Writing for "IGN Entertainment", Laura Burrows was critical of Meredith Grey's (Ellen Pompeo) episodic character development, opining "Week after week of lovers that are mere allusions to the Grey-Shepherd-Rose triangle are getting tedious. Grey is no longer some one we want to 'win' love because she has become mundane. If we wanted to watch love that goes no where and struggles to be compelling then we would watch reruns of "Newlyweds"".

Li Sheng (general)

Li Sheng (李晟) (727 – September 13, 793), courtesy name Liangqi (良器), formally Prince Zhongwu of Xiping (西平忠武王), was a general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, mostly known for his service under Emperor Dezong in destroying the rebel Zhu Ci and restoring Emperor Dezong.
Background.
Li Sheng was born in 727, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Tao Prefecture (洮州, in modern Dingxi, Gansu). His ancestors, including his grandfather Li Sigong (李思恭) and father Li Qin (李欽), served as low-level military officers on the borders. Li Qin died when Li Sheng was only a few years old, and it was said that Li Sheng was filially pious to his mother. He was brave and strong-willed, and capable in riding and archery.
Li Sheng started his military service when he was 17. At that time, he was tall and brave, impressing the army. He served under Wang Zhongsi, the military governor ("Jiedushi") of Hexi Circuit (河西, headquartered in modern Wuwei, Gansu), on a campaign against Tufan. At one fort, there was a Tufan officer who was fierce in defending on top of the fort walls and who killed many Tang soldiers. Wang requested for a volunteer to strike down the Tufan officer, and Li volunteered; he then fired a single arrow that killed the Tufan officer. Wang was impressed, patted his back, and stated, "This is one who can rival 10,000." Later, Gao Shengya (高昇雅) the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), who had known Li by reputation, invited Li to serve under him. While serving under Gao, Li was victorious in two campaigns against rebellious Qiang tribes, and was promoted to the rank of general.
During Emperor Daizong's reign.
Early in the "Guangde" era (763-764) of Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong, the then-military governor of Fengxiang Circuit, Sun Zhizhi (孫志直), made Li Sheng the commander of high mobility troops, and after Li defeated the Dangxiang tribal chieftain Gao Yu (高玉), he was given the honorary title of "Tejin" (特進) as well as honorary position as a minister.
Early in Emperor Daizong's "Dali" era (766-779), the subsequent military governor of Fengxiang, Li Baoyu, made Li Sheng the commander of his right wing troops. In 768, Tufan forces put Ling Prefecture (靈州, in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia) under siege. Li Baoyu gave Li Sheng 5,000 men to attack Tufan troops to try to alleviate the siege. Li Sheng declined — stating, "If I were going to use overwhelming power, 5,000 are not enough; if I were going to use strategies, 5,000 are too many." Instead, he took only 1,000 men and advanced out of Dazhen Pass (大震關, in modern Baoji) and attacked a Tufan garrison in Tao Prefecture, which had then been seized by Tufan; he slaughtered the Tufan garrison and burned the Tufan supplies stored there. When Tufan forces sieging Ling Prefecture heard the news, they lifted the siege and withdrew. For his contributions, he was given the honorary title of "Kaifu Yitong Sansi" (開府儀同三司). He was soon made the military commander under Ma Lin (馬璘) the military governor of Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), and on an occasion, after Ma was defeated by Tufan troops at Yancang (鹽倉, in modern Pingliang) and could not regroup to return to Jingyuan's capital Jing Prefecture, it was by Li Sheng's efforts that Ma's troops were able to fight past the Tufan troops back to Jing Prefecture. On account of this battle, Li was created the Prince of Hechuan. However, Ma was jealous of his battle prowess and displeased that he was not giving Ma proper respect, and therefore subsequently sent him to the capital Chang'an. Emperor Daizong kept Li at Chang'an to serve as a general of the Shence Army (神策軍), which was under direct imperial control.
During Emperor Dezong's reign.
Before Zhu Ci's rebellion.
In 779, during the reign of Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong, there was a joint Tufan and Nanzhao attack on Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). Emperor Dezong sent Li Sheng and Qu Huan (曲環), commanding imperial guards and troops from several circuits, against Tufan and Nanzhao troops, defeating them and relieving Xichuan Circuit from attack.
In 781, after several circuits that had been "de facto" independent — Chengde (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), Weibo (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), Pinglu (平盧, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), and Shannan East (山南東道, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) — took a defiant stand against the imperial government over Emperor Dezong's refusal to allow Chengde's military governor Li Baochen to be succeeded by his son Li Weiyue and Pinglu's military governor Li Zhengji to be succeeded by his son Li Na, Emperor Dezong sent Li Sheng, Ma Sui, and Li Baozhen (Li Baoyu's cousin) against Weibo's military governor Tian Yue, who was then sieging Linming (臨洺, in modern Handan), which was in Li Baozhen's Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi). Their joint forces defeated Tian's, forcing Tian to withdraw back to Weibo's capital Wei Prefecture (魏州). However, the imperial troops' attacks stalemated and was additionally hampered by discord between Ma and Li Baozhen. Meanwhile, Li Weiyue's general Wang Wujun had killed Li Weiyue and submitted to imperial authority, but rebelled again, along with Zhu Tao, who had previously been loyal to the imperial government, over Emperor Dezong's failure to reward them as they believed they deserved. When Wang subsequently pressured Zhaoyi's Xing Prefecture (邢州, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), Li Baozhen sent some of his troops to defend Xing Prefecture — drawing Ma's ire in that Ma believed Li Baozhen was merely trying to preserve his own territory, to the point that Ma considered withdrawing entirely. Only with Li Sheng's intercession was the relationship between Ma and Li Baozhen restored. Subsequently, though, after imperial forces suffered a defeat at the hands of Zhu and Wang and were forced to lift the siege on Wei Prefecture in 782, Li Sheng took his troops and rendezvoused with the troops of Zhang Xiaozhong the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (義武, in modern Baoding, Hebei) to lift the siege that Wang Wujun's son Wang Shizhen had been laying against Zhao Prefecture (趙州, in modern Shijiazhuang), then held by a general loyal to the imperial government, Kang Rizhi (康日知). He and Zhang thereafter planned to attack Wang's headquarters at Heng Prefecture (恆州, in modern Shijiazhuang). In spring 783, he, along with Zhang's son Zhang Shengyun (張昇雲) attacked Zhu's officer Zheng Jingji (鄭景濟) at Qingyuan (清苑, in modern Baoding). This, however, drew a response from Zhu, who left Wei Prefecture and arrived at Qingyuan to battle Li Sheng. He defeated Li Sheng, forcing Li Sheng, who grew ill after the defeat, back to Yiwu's capital Ding Prefecture (定州).
During Zhu Ci's rebellion.
In fall 783, Jingyuan troops, then at Chang'an to wait for deployment to the eastern battlefield, mutinied when Emperor Dezong did not give them sufficient rewards, forcing Emperor Dezong to flee to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). They supported Zhu Tao's brother Zhu Ci as their leader, and Zhu Ci soon declared himself the emperor of a new state of Qin and put Fengtian under siege. Li Sheng, upon his recovery later in the year, wanted to head immediately toward Fengtian to aid Emperor Dezong, but Zhang Xiaozhong, whose Yiwu Circuit was wedged between Zhu Tao's and Wang Wujun's territory and feared that he would be attacked, tried to keep Li Sheng at Yiwu. Only after Li Sheng bribed Zhang's subordinates with jade and also kept his son Li Ping (李憑) at Yiwu (to be married to Zhang's daughter) did Zhang agree to let Li Sheng depart, and he further had his subordinate Yang Rongguo (楊榮國) accompany Li Sheng to aid Emperor Dezong. Emperor Dezong gave Li Sheng the title of military governor of Shence Army. As he arrived in Chang'an's vicinity, however, with only 4,000 soldiers, he was not able to challenge Zhu's sieging army directly, and so stopped at the East Wei River Bridge (東渭橋) near Chang'an. It was said that because he was capable in leadership and in sharing the soldiers' difficulties, people were happy to follow him, and soon, with soldiers in Chang'an's vicinity joining him, his troops grew to 10,000. 
The major general Li Huaiguang soon arrived and forced Zhu Ci to lift his siege on Fengtian. However, Emperor Dezong then alienated Li Huaiguang by refusing to meet him and instead ordering him to rendezvous with Li Sheng and two other military governors, Li Jianhui (李建徽) and Yang Huiyuan (楊惠元) in attacking Chang'an. When Li Huaiguang did rendezvous with Li Sheng, Li Jianhui, and Yang, he not only did not attack Chang'an, but simply halted at Xianyang (咸陽, in modern Xianyang). By spring 784, Li Sheng had begun to suspect Li Huaiguang's intentions and (correctly) believed that Li Huaiguang was in communications with Zhu Ci. He, fearing that Li Huaiguang would seize his troops, received permission from Emperor Dezong to return to East Wei River Bridge. He subsequently submitted a secret petition to Emperor Dezong urging Emperor Dezong to anticipate a rebellion by Li Huaiguang and keeping the path to the Hanzhong and Shu (蜀, i.e., Xichuan) region clear. Emperor Dezong hesitated and tried to calm Li Huaiguang to let Li Huaiguang remain in the imperial camp. Instead, Li Huaiguang publicly announced that he was rebelling, and Emperor Dezong fled to Liang Prefecture (梁州, in modern Hanzhong). Prior to fleeing, Emperor Dezong gave Li Sheng the honorary chancellor designation "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事), effectively making Li Sheng the supreme commander of the troops in the Chang'an region still loyal to the imperial cause.
At that time, Li Sheng was effectively stuck with a small army between Zhu Ci and Li Huaiguang. He sent humble letters to Li Huaiguang urging Li Huaiguang to reconsider and again join the imperial cause, and while Li Huaiguang did not do so, he was sufficiently embarrassed that he did not attack Li Sheng. Soon, with a number of Li Huaiguang's subordinates defecting and accepting Li Sheng's orders, Li Huaiguang feared an attack from Li Sheng, and therefore withdrew from the region entirely, back to Hezhong (河中, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), leaving Li Sheng and his allies to face Zhu's state (which by that point had been renamed Han). Zhu Ci tried to persuade Li Sheng to join his cause by treating Li Sheng's relatives remaining in Chang'an with kindness, but Li Sheng was not swayed.
Soon, with Emperor Dezong sending the general Hun Zhen toward Chang'an as well, Li Sheng prepared his assault against Chang'an. On June 12, 784, Li Sheng announced to his troops that the battle for Chang'an was to begin, and then began moving toward Chang'an, in coordination with Hun, Luo Yuanguang (駱元光), and Shang Kegu (尚可孤). Han troops made several attacks against his advancing troops but were defeated each time, and on June 19, Li Sheng entered Chang'an, forcing Zhu Ci to flee. (Zhu Ci was subsequently killed in flight by his own subordinates.)
After Zhu Ci's rebellion.
When Li Sheng's report of victory reached Emperor Dezong at Liang Prefecture, Emperor Dezong was touched and stated, "Heaven granted Li Sheng for the sake of the empire, not me." Li Sheng executed a number of Zhu Ci's officials and welcomed Emperor Dezong back to Chang'an. Emperor Dezong gave Li Sheng the honorary title of "Situ" (司徒, one of the Three Excellencies) and made him "Zhongshu Ling" (中書令), the head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, "Zhongshu Sheng"), a post considered one for a chancellor.
After Emperor Dezong's return to Chang'an, he made Li Sheng the military governor of Fengxiang and Longyou (隴右, headquartered in modern Tianshui, Gansu) Circuits, stationed at Fengxiang to defend against Tufan attacks. He also created Li Sheng the Prince of Xiping. In the celebrations of the victory over Zhu, when Emperor Dezong was honoring the generals, Li Sheng was honored first, and Hun Zhen was honored second. Subsequently, Li Sheng, after arriving at Fengxiang, executed a number of officers who had previously killed the former military governor Zhang Yi, to restore military discipline. Subsequently, in 785, when many officials suggested, in light of the imperial government's weakened state, that Emperor Dezong pardon Li Huaiguang, Li Sheng strenuously opposed, pointing out that there were five main reasons why Li Huaiguang could not be pardoned:
Li Sheng further offered to attack Li Huaiguang himself without further supplies from the imperial treasury. Emperor Dezong thus ruled against pardoning Li Huaiguang, but did not accept Li Sheng's offer to attack Li Huaiguang himself, instead sending Hun and Ma Sui against Li Huaiguang. Li Huaiguang soon committed suicide under threat of impending attack from Ma and Hun, and his territory was reintegrated into imperial control.
Meanwhile, a past grudge that Li Sheng had with Zhang Yanshang, the military governor of Xichuan, began to affect Li Sheng's position at court. Previously, Li Sheng had, after his campaign against Tufan and Nanzhao at Xichuan, brought the military prostitute Gao Hong (高洪) with him. Zhang, angry with this, sent messengers to chase after Li Sheng's army to demand Gao back, thus causing a grudge between Li Sheng and Zhang. Late in 785, with the chancellor Liu Congyi ill, Emperor Dezong, who was happy with how Zhang had kept his court in exile well-supplied during the time he was at Liang Prefecture, considered making Zhang a chancellor. Li Sheng vehemently opposed and submitted a petition listing a number of Zhang's crimes. Emperor Dezong, not willing to go against Li Sheng at this point, still summoned Zhang back to Chang'an but only made him "Zuo Pushe" (左僕射), one of the heads of the executive bureau (尚書省, "Shangshu Sheng"), but not chancellor.
In 786, the Tufan chancellor Shang Jiezan (尚結贊), who believed that Li Sheng, Hun, and Ma were the only three people standing between him and a conquest of Tang, developed a strategy to create suspicions in Emperor Dezong's minds against the three. Thus, during a major incursion, he claimed to have been summoned by Li Sheng. Meanwhile, Li Sheng's son-in-law Zhang Yu (張彧), angry that Li Sheng held a grander ceremony for another daughter's marriage to Cui Shu (崔樞) than when Zhang and his wife married, joined Zhang Yanshang's party, as did another disgruntled former staffer of Li Sheng's, Zheng Yunkui (鄭雲逵). Zhang Yanshang used the opportunity of the Tufan invasion to alleged to Emperor Dezong that Li Sheng would commit treason, and Emperor Dezong, already suspicious of Li Sheng after his great accomplishments, began to believe the allegations, but when Li Sheng offered to resign, he refused. The chancellor Han Huang, who was friendly with Li Sheng, tried to mediate, and Han and the general Liu Xuanzuo (劉玄佐) held a feast for Li Sheng and Zhang Yanshang, hoping to dissolve their enmity. Both agreed, and Li Sheng further tried to dissolve Zhang Yanshang's resentment by endorsing him as chancellor. In spring 787, Emperor Dezong, accordingly, made Zhang Yanshang a chancellor. However, while Zhang Yanshang agreed to dissolve his resentment, the resentment persisted, and when Li Sheng requested that Zhang give a daughter to one of his sons in marriage, Zhang refused, causing Li Sheng to comment:
Meanwhile, Shang continued his incursion, but by spring 787 was running into difficulties with the livestock of his army dying due to illnesses. He sought peace through Ma, but the peace proposal was opposed by Li Sheng and Han. Han soon died, however, and with Ma and Zhang both endorsing peace, Emperor Dezong agreed. He further used Li Sheng's opposition as excuse — stating that the peace with Tufan was beneficial to the empire despite Li Sheng's reservations — to remove Li Sheng from his command at Fengxiang, although he allowed Li Sheng to recommend his successor; Li Sheng recommended his officer Xing Junya (邢君牙). Emperor Dezong recalled Li Sheng to Chang'an to serve as "Zhongshu Ling" and "Taiwei" (太尉, also one of the Three Excellencies) and relieved him of all of his military duties. It was said that once Li Sheng returned to Chang'an, despite the suspicions that he was under, he nevertheless spoke honestly whenever he had opinions about the matters of state. In light of Zhang's involvement in Li Sheng's command being lifted, subsequently, when Zhang wanted Li Baozhen, and then Liu, to serve as the new commander of defense forces on the borders with Tufan, both Li Baozhen and Liu declined.
By summer 787, Emperor Dezong and Shang had negotiated a peace treaty, and Hun, as Emperor Dezong's emissary, was set to meet with Shang at Pingliangchuan (平涼川, in modern Pingliang). Li Sheng, fearing Tufan treachery, instructed Hun to be careful, but Zhang, hearing this, accused Li Sheng of interfering with the peace with Tufan. Emperor Dezong thus instructed Hun to be relaxes, not to aggravate Tufan in any way. On July 8, 787, at the meeting site, Shang laid a trap for Hun and launched a sudden attack, killing and capturing many of Hun's attendants, but Hun escaped. When the news reached Chang'an, Emperor Dezong was so panicked that he considered fleeing Chang'an, but remained due to Li Sheng's advice. As a result of this debacle, Zhang claimed an illness and retired, while Emperor Dezong recalled Ma to the capital and stripped him of his command.
Later in the year, Emperor Dezong made a respected senior advisor, Li Mi — who had previously served his grandfather Emperor Suzong and father Emperor Daizong but declined major offices — chancellor. At a meeting that Emperor Dezong hosted for Li Mi, with Liu Hun, Ma, and Li Sheng also present, Li Mi openly asked Emperor Dezong to guarantee Li Sheng's and Ma's personal safety, due to their great achievements. Emperor Dezong agreed. Later, when Li Mi advocated an alliance with Huige against Tufan, despite Emperor Dezong's longstanding hatred toward Huige — as, during an incident in 762 while he was still the Prince of Yong under Emperor Dezong, a number of his staff members had been arrested and killed by Huige's then-khan Dengli Khan Yaoluoge Yidijian (藥羅葛移地建) over a dispute in the meeting protocol between the young prince and the khan — Li Sheng and Ma spoke in favor of the alliance, finally persuading Emperor Dezong in conjunction with Li Mi's advice.
Li Sheng died in 793. Emperor Dezong publicly mourned him greatly, and, when new salt was presented later in the year from Yan Prefecture (鹽州, in modern Yulin, Shaanxi), which had just been newly recaptured from Tufan, Emperor Dezong, who awarded some of that new salt to the chancellors, also had the salt presented to Li Sheng's grave. Li Sheng's sons Li Yuan (李愿), Li Su (李愬), Li Ting (李聽), Li Xian (李憲), and nephew Wang Bi (王佖) all served as generals later.

Cheick Diabaté (footballer)

Cheick Tidiane Diabaté (born 25 April 1988) is a Malian international football player who currently plays for French club Bordeaux in Ligue 1.
Club career.
Bordeaux.
Diabaté was promoted to the senior squad of Bordeaux for the 2008–09 season following a successful season in the CFA, where he made 35 appearances and scored 18 goals. Due to a surplus of more experienced strikers, manager Laurent Blanc loaned him out to the Corsica-based and Ligue 2 club AC Ajaccio to get more playing time.
Loan moves.
Diabaté made his debut for Ajaccio in their opening match loss to Châteauroux playing the full 90 minutes. In the second match, he proved beneficial to the club scoring a brace in their 3–1 win over Stade Reims. Three weeks later, he scored another brace, this time in a 4–0 thrashing of Vannes. The following three weeks, he scored one goal in each match with Ajaccio earning wins over Brest and Clermont and drawing with Nîmes. 
Diabaté's positive play continued throughout the season scoring important game-winning goals against Guingamp, Lens, Angers, and Boulogne. He also scored a goal in the annual "Derby Corse" against Bastia with the match finishing in a 1–1 draw. Diabaté finished the season with 14 goals, a team high and 4th among Ligue 2 topscorers, helping the club stave off relegation on the final day of the season.
Diabaté's play with Ajaccio earned him a contract extension with his parent club agreeing to remain in Bordeaux until June 2013. Despite returning to Bordeaux on 1 July, on 20 July, he was sent on loan again, this time to fellow Ligue 1 club AS Nancy. The striker has spent most of the stint playing in the reserves only featuring twice with the senior team.
International career.
Diabaté started out with Mali's national under-17 team where they participated in the 2005 African U-17 Championship. He scored a goal in each of their group stage matches but Mali failed to advance to the knockout round. Less than a month after the tournament, he would get his senior debut against Liberia in a 2006 World Cup qualifier where they won 4–1. He came on as an 85th minute substitute for Dramane Coulibaly. Diabaté was a member of the Mali side that earned third place at the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. He finished the tournament as one of the top scorers, having netted 3 goals in total, including two in the third place play-off against Ghana on 11 February 2012.

Benjamin Cook (journalist)

Benjamin Cook (born 17 October 1982 in Isleworth, London) is an English journalist, writer and regular contributor to "Radio Times" and "Doctor Who Magazine". He has also been published in "The Telegraph", "TV Times", "Filmstar", "Cult Times", "TV Zone" and "The Stage", and is the author of "Doctor Who: The New Audio Adventures – The Inside Story". In 2008, BBC Books published "Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale", based on a year-long email correspondence between Cook and "Doctor Who" executive producer Russell T Davies. A revised and updated paperback edition, "The Writer's Tale: The Final Chapter" (featuring 350 pages of new material, extending the correspondence by another year), was published in January 2010.
Early life.
Cook went to Orleans Park School in Twickenham from 1994 to 1999. At the age of 13, in 1996, he won a competition run by BBC children's news programme "Newsround". In a 2008 interview, he explained:
The first thing I ever wrote was for "Newsround"’s Press Packers... to enter a competition, and I won that, so I got to go to the BBC for the day – and work at "Radio Times" for a day, which now of course, a decade later, I’m doing regularly, and getting paid for it! – so that sort of sparked my interest.
He went to Richmond upon Thames College from 1999 to 2001, and then, from 2002 to 2006, attended Collingwood College at the University of Durham, where he studied English Literature.
"Radio Times".
For "Radio Times" magazine, Cook has written on E4 teen drama "Skins" ("The assertion that it's our job simply to reflect life is always a cop-out," co-creator Bryan Elsley told him. "But people who think it's our duty to educate young people on the correct way to live are just as bonkers"), ITV talent show "The X Factor" ("We weren't always fighting," Dannii Minogue confessed about ex-judge Sharon Osbourne, "but Sharon made it clear that she didn't like me, so she won't be missed. Not by me"), short-lived ITV fantasy drama "Demons" ("I didn't entirely understand "Demons"," actor Richard Wilson told Cook. "I just had to say I did and hope no-one caught on"), the BBC's "The Omid Djalili Show" ("The first series was OK, but we all agreed it was there to be bettered," said Omid Djalili. "It was a bit slapdash, to be honest"), "Dan Cruickshank's Adventures in Architecture" and "Wild China", Comedy Central's "Kröd Mändoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire", as well as BBC dramas "Doctor Who", "The Sarah Jane Adventures", "Merlin", "Little Dorrit" and "Spooks". In 2009, Cook interviewed US boy band the Jonas Brothers for "Radio Times", in which they spoke out about the controversy surrounding comedian Russell Brand's ridicule of their chastity rings at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards: "You know what? We were happy to see he recognised their value," reasoned Joe. "You have to learn to laugh," Kevin added. The next year, Cook conducted the "first Twitter interview" with Stephen Fry, asking him how he accounted for (fellow 2010 National Television Award nominee) Piers Morgan's career: "It's pretty hard to imagine, isn't it?" replied Fry. "Biodiversity is the answer... Just as nature needs a few snakes and bugs, TV needs Piers Morgan and me!"
"Doctor Who Magazine".
Cook first wrote for "Doctor Who Magazine" ("DWM") in March 1999. Since then, his catalogue of interviews for the publication ranges from David Tennant, Billie Piper, Kylie Minogue and Richard E Grant to Peter Kay, Charlotte Church and McFly, and the first ever major print interview with Matt Smith. Cook's regular back-page interview column, "Who on Earth is...", has featured such diverse names as Bernard Cribbins, Timothy Dalton, Duncan James from Blue and Professor Richard Dawkins.
Cook has compiled six "DWM" Special Editions – published between 2005 and 2010, under the umbrella title "In Their Own Words" – providing a chronological commentary on the making of the TV series, from 1963 to 2009, by those involved in its production, collated from extracts of interviews previously published in "DWM".
In 2002, Cook tracked down elusive "Doctor Who" scriptwriter Christopher Bailey and interviewed him for "DWM". This inspired Robert Shearman to write "Deadline", an acclaimed audio play starring Derek Jacobi as retired writer Martin Bannister (loosely based on Bailey) and Ian Brooker as journalist Sydney (loosely based on Cook), reporter for the fictional "Juliet Bravo Magazine". In a 2004 interview, Shearman explained:
I think "Deadline" is in some ways inspired by the idea that he Bannister gets tracked down by, essentially, Ben Cook. Not called Ben Cook in the play, of course – but it was actually based on "DWM"s Christopher Bailey interview. Here was a writer who hadn't been interviewed for many years, and was obviously not bitter about it, but had [...] his own perspective of what he wanted to say and do.
In February 2008, Cook had a contentious interview with actor Clive Swift. "I'm quite aggrieved," Swift told him. "Why should I do this? I'm not getting paid, am I?" Swift refused to answer some of Cook's questions and replied brusquely to others. When Cook asked Swift – best known for his portrayal of Richard Bucket in BBC sitcom "Keeping Up Appearances" – whether people shout "Richard" at him in the street, the actor replied: "Sometimes. I tell them to fuck off." The encounter ended with Swift insisting, "I know that you all think that this is a big world, this "Who" business. But it isn't. There are much bigger things than this." When Cook replied, "Maybe, but it means a lot to a great many of us," Swift terminated the interview.
In another controversial interview, in January 2010, outgoing "Doctor Who" star David Tennant told Cook:
Clearly the Labour Party is not without some issues right now [...] but they're still a better bet than the Tories. I would still rather have Gordon Brown than David Cameron. I would rather have a Prime Minister who is the cleverest person in the room than a Prime Minister who looks good in a suit. I think David Cameron is a terrifying prospect. I think he's a regional newscaster who will jump on whatever bandwagon flies past. I get quite panicked at the notion that people are buying into his rhetoric, because it seems very manipulative to me... It's very weird that you can work in the arts – which tends to be about empathy, and understanding the human condition, and hopefully feeling some kind of sympathy for your fellow man – and vote for the Tories. I do find that inconceivable.
Tennant's comments were widely reported, with Cameron offering a rebuttal on Richard Bacon's BBC Radio 5 Live show on 11 January:
Well, that's a pity, but there we are. You're never going to win over everybody. I definitely believe there's no point trying to win over everyone. Say what you think, say what you believe in, say what you believe needs to be done – and if people will come with you, they will come with you. I never give up, so maybe I'll have another go at convincing him.
"The Writer's Tale".
In 2008, BBC Books published "Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale", based on an in-depth email correspondence between Cook and "Doctor Who" executive producer Russell T Davies, spanning February 2007 to March 2008, during production of the show's fourth series. Extracts were published in "The Times" on 16 and 17 September 2008, and the book itself met with positive reviews. Esther Walker of "The Independent" predicted that "the fans will adore it. Davies has engaged with the book totally and there is full disclosure from him about everything." The Daily Telegraph's Robert Colvile called the book "Remarkably open", adding: "Despite the self-deprecating bonhomie, there's a ruthless confidence to Davies." In a five-star review for "Heat" magazine, Boyd Hilton called it "a funny, revealing insight into the workings of the genius who puts the show together." In another five-star review, "SFX Magazine" said, "You can douse all the other books about new "Who" in lighter fuel and spark up your Zippo – this is all you need. It's the only one that opens a door into the brain of the series' showrunner." Darren Scott of "The Pink Paper" – which also awarded the book five stars – agreed: "If you’re an uber fan of the show... or an aspiring (or even established) writer, this book will very, very quickly fall into the 'can’t put down' category." Scott Matthewman of "The Stage" said, "I can't recommend "The Writer's Tale" highly enough… It's a genuine insight into the entire television production process." ""The Writer's Tale" is an enormous book, but consumed compulsively it doesn't last very long at all," said Thom Hutchinson of "Death Ray" magazine. "We learn, brilliantly, the difference between bellowing media personage Big Russell and the apprehensive, chain-smoking obsessive who exists alone and silent in the early hours." "The Scotsman"'s team of arts writers said: ""The Writer's Tale" offers a fascinating insight into the writing of one of TV's biggest hits." Veronica Horwell of "The Guardian" called it "the "Doctor Who Annual" for adults", suggesting that 500-odd pages "is not nearly enough, should have been 1001 pages, because Davies doesn't need to be writing fiction, shaping stuff retrieved from the flux of his Great Maybe, to be a storyteller. He's the Scheherazade of Cardiff Bay." Horwell described Davies as "a total romantic about writing. It's his love, his drug, his force for change: over the year even invisible, unopinionated Cook emerges as a proper companion who challenges Davies over the last image in the series. And wins. Brilliant."
In the blogosphere, "Sci-Fi Online"s Daniel Salter claimed that "The Writer's Tale" "could be one of the most important "Doctor Who" books you're ever likely to read, even if it's not always about "Doctor Who"." "Page after page of banter that's just as exciting and suspenseful as the show itself," enthused Sebastian J. Brook of "Doctor Who Online". "Cook's fearless and intelligent approach to asking questions pave the way for some fantastic responses as he manages to temper Davies' fun, energetic and sometimes insecure narrative with good, solid and sometimes cheeky responses." "Off The Telly"s Graham Kibble-White concluded: "Candid, lucid and an all-too painful evocation of the challenges inherit in writing and running perhaps the most important show on the BBC".
In November 2008, it was announced that Richard and Judy, the couple credited with revolutionising the reading habits of Britons, had selected "The Writer's Tale" for their Christmas Presents book strand – in the Serious Non-Fiction category – as part of the prestigious "Richard & Judy Book Club". The couple described the book as "an absolute snapshot into the mind of a creative writer... It's a free flow of thought – a stream of consciousness. It's a great book."
On 2 December 2008, inspired by "The Writer's Tale", Charlie Brooker devoted an extended edition of his BBC Four TV show "Screenwipe" entirely to interviews with prestigious writers, including Russell T Davies.
In June 2009, "The Writer's Tale" was shortlisted in the "Best Non-Fiction" category at the 2009 British Fantasy Awards, but ultimately lost out to Stephen Jones' "Basil Copper: A Life in Books".
Published in January 2010, the paperback edition, "The Writer's Tale: The Final Chapter", updates Davies and Cook's correspondence to September 2009, to cover Davies' final year as Head Writer and Executive Producer of "Doctor Who", taking in David Tennant's final few episodes as the Doctor. Critical reception was generally positive. "SFX" magazine's Ian Berriman described the book as "satisfyingly voyeuristic" and said, "It’s well worth buying, even if you’ve already got the original edition." "The Guardian"s Vera Rule called it "Far more than a ritual 'making of'" and the "Best masterclass in telly I've ever attended," adding: "Made me cry." "Heat" magazine included the book on its "Hot List" of "The Top Ten Things We At "Heat" Are Completely Obsessed With This Week." However, "Private Eye" criticised the tome for being "breathlessly self-congratulatory" – "a bring-your-own-extolment party in which readers are invited to bask in the outrageous genius of this bear-like TV demagogue."
Asked, in a February 2010 interview, whether there were any plans to conduct a similar correspondence with Davies' successor as showunner, Steven Moffat, Cook replied: Not at the moment. Well, not by me. Maybe Steven's e-mailing someone else! But look, e-mailing me isn't a prerequisite for taking the job of showrunner. I'm not handed down from head writer to head writer, like a soup recipe. Or a genetic disorder. "The Writer's Tale" sort of came about by accident, really, and it was quite an organic process, at a time when Russell already had three series under his belt...
YouTube.
On 16 August 2012, Cook released a trailer on his YouTube account "ninebrassmonkeys" for his new project, Becoming Youtube, a 12-part video series about the YouTube community. Presented in a documentary style and incorporating sketch comedy and fantasy sequences, Becoming YouTube also documents Cook's first attempts to enter the medium of online video. The first episode was launched on 9 December 2012.
Press.
On 7 April 2013, Cook was featured in The Guardian in an article about Britain's 20 most popular video bloggers and about his success with Becoming Youtube.

The Becoming (Grey's Anatomy)

"The Becoming" is the fourteenth episode of the fourth season of the American television medical drama "Grey's Anatomy", and the 75th episode of the overall series. It premiered on May 8, 2008. Written by series co-producers Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, the episode was directed by filmmaker Julie Anne Robinson, being viewed by 16.03 million Americans. Writing for "IGN Entertainment", Laura Burrows expressed confusion regarding Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Erica Hahn's (Brooke Smith) character development, noting that "the whole Callie-Hahn relationship is still up in the air, but I am sure I was not the only one to notice the bulls eye placed directly in the middle of Callie and Erica as they talked about their alleged relationship. So maybe introducing the gay soldiers was just a clever ruse to introduce successful gay relationships."

Early work.
Cannon's early work concerned topological aspects of embedded surfaces in R3 and understanding the difference between "tame" and "wild" surfaces. 
His first famous result came in late 70s when Cannon gave a complete solution to a long-standing "double suspension" problem posed by John Milnor. Cannon proved that the double suspension of a homology sphere is a topological sphere. R. D. Edwards had previously proven this in many cases.
The results of Cannon's paper were used by Cannon, Bryant and Lacher to prove (1979) an important case of the so-called "characterization conjecture" for topological manifolds. The conjecture says that a generalized "n"-manifold "M", where "n" ≥ 5, which satisfies the "disjoint disk property" is a topological manifold. Cannon, Bryant and Lacher established that the conjecture holds under the assumption that "M" be a manifold except possibly at a set of dimension ("n"−2)/2. Later Quinn completed the proof that the characterization conjecture holds in full generality.
1980s: Hyperbolic geometry, 3-manifolds and geometric group theory.
In 1980s the focus of Cannon's work shifted to the study of 3-manifolds, hyperbolic geometry and Kleinian groups and he is considered one of the key figures in the birth of geometric group theory as a distinct subject in late 1980s and early 1990s. Cannon's 1984 paper "The combinatorial structure of cocompact discrete hyperbolic groups" was one of the forerunners in the development of the theory of word-hyperbolic groups, a notion that was introduced and developed three years later in a seminal 1987 monograph of Gromov. Cannon's paper explored combinatorial and algorithmic aspects of the Cayley graphs of Kleinian groups and related them to the geometric features of the actions of these groups on the hyperbolic space. In particular, Cannon proved that convex-cocompact Kleinian groups admit finite presentations where the Dehn algorithm solves the word problem. The latter condition later turned out to give one of equivalent characterization of being word-hyperbolic and, moreover, Cannon's original proof essentially went through without change to show that the word problem in word-hyperbolic groups is solvable by Dehn's algorithm. Cannon's 1984 paper also introduced an important notion a "cone type" of an element of a finitely generated group (roughly, the set of all geodesic extensions of an element). Cannon proved that a convex-cocompact Kleinian group has only finitely many cone types (with respect to a fixed finite generating set of that group) and showed how to use this fact to conclude that the growth series of the group is a rational function. These arguments also turned out to generalize to the word-hyperbolic group context. Now standard proofs of the fact that the set of geodesic words in a word-hyperbolic group is a regular language also use finiteness of the number of cone types. 
Cannon's work also introduced an important notion of "almost convexity" for Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups, a notion that led to substantial further study and generalizations.
An influential paper of Cannon and Thurston "Group invariant Peano curves", that first circulated in a preprint form in mid-1980s, introduced the notion of what is now called the Cannon–Thurston map. They considered the case of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold "M" that fibers over the circle with the fiber being a closed hyperbolic surface "S". In this case the universal cover of "S", which is identified with the hyperbolic plane, admits an embedding into the universal cover of "M", which is the hyperbolic 3-space. Cannon and Thurston proved that this embedding extends to a continuous π1("S")-equivariant surjective map (now called the "Cannon–Thurston map") from the ideal boundary of the hyperbolic plane (the circle) to the ideal boundary of the hyperbolic 3-space (the 2-sphere). 
Although the paper of Cannon and Thurston was finally published only in 2007, in the meantime it has generated considerable further research and a number of significant generalizations (both in the contexts of Kleinian groups and of word-hyperbolic groups), including the work of Mahan Mitra, Klarreich, Bowditch and others.
1990s and 2000s: Automatic groups, discrete conformal geometry and Cannon's conjecture.
Cannon was one of the co-authors of the 1992 book "Word Processing in Groups" which introduced, formalized and developed the theory of automatic groups. The theory of automatic groups brought new computational ideas from computer science to geometric group theory and played an important role in the development of the subject in 1990s.
A 1994 paper of Cannon gave a proof of the "combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem" that was motivated by the classic Riemann mapping theorem in complex analysis. The goal was to understand when an action of a group by homeomorphisms on a 2-sphere is (up to a topological conjugation) an action on the standard Riemann sphere by Möbius transformations. The "combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem" of Cannon gave a set of sufficient conditions when a sequence of finer and finer combinatorial subdivisions of a topological surface determine, in the appropriate sense and after passing to the limit, an actual conformal structure on that surface. This paper of Cannon led to an important conjecture, first explicitly formulated by Cannon and Swenson in 1998 (but also suggested in implicit form in Section 8 of Cannon's 1994 paper) and now known as Cannon's conjecture, regarding characterizing word-hyperbolic groups with the 2-sphere as the boundary. The conjecture (Conjecture 5.1 in ) states that if the ideal boundary of a word-hyperbolic group "G" is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, then "G" admits a properly discontinuous cocompact isometric action on the hyperbolic 3-space (so that "G" is essentially a 3-dimensional Kleinian group). In analytic terms Cannon's conjecture is equivalent to saying that if the ideal boundary of a word-hyperbolic group "G" is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere then this boundary, with the visual metric coming from the Cayley graph of "G", is quasisymmetric to the standard 2-sphere. 
The 1998 paper of Cannon and Swenson gave an initial approach to this conjecture by proving that the conjecture holds under an extra assumption that the family of standard "disks" in the boundary of the group satisfies a combinatorial "conformal" property. The main result of Cannon's 1994 paper played a key role in the proof. This approach to Cannon's conjecture and related problems was pushed further later in the joint work of Cannon, Floyd and Parry.
Cannon's conjecture motivated much of subsequent work by other mathematicians and to a substantial degree informed subsequent interaction between geometric group theory and the theory of analysis on metric spaces. Cannon's conjecture was motivated (see ) by Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture and by trying to understand why in dimension three variable negative curvature can be promoted to constant negative curvature. Although the Geometrization conjecture was recently settled by Perelman, Cannon's conjecture remains wide open and is considered one of the key outstanding open problems in geometric group theory and geometric topology.
Applications to biology.
The ideas of combinatorial conformal geometry that underlie Cannon's proof of the "combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem", were applied by Cannon, Floyd and Parry (2000) to the study of large-scale growth patterns of biological organisms. Cannon, Floyd and Parry produced a mathematical growth model which demonstrated that some systems determined by simple finite subdivision rules can results in objects (in their example, a tree trunk) whose large-scale form oscillates wildly over time even though the local subdivision laws remain the same. Cannon, Floyd and Parry also applied their model to the analysis of the growth patterns of rat tissue. They suggested that the "negatively curved" (or non-euclidean) nature of microscopic growth patterns of biological organisms is one of the key reasons why large-scale organisms do not look like crystals or polyhedral shapes but in fact in many cases resemble self-similar fractals. In particular they suggested (see section 3.4 of ) that such "negatively curved" local structure is manifested in highly folded and highly connected nature of the brain and the lung tissue.
