She was criticized in the media and Parliament for the newsletter. Block defended the message but said the content was a draft, and expressed regret about some of the language used.
Following the 2013 redrawing of Saskatchewan's federal electoral boundaries, Block stated she would run in the new riding of Humboldt-Warman-Martensville-Rosetown.
In September 2013, Ms.Block was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Natural Resources.

Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt

The Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt also known as the First Egyptian Satrapy was effectively a province of the Achaemenid Persian Empire between 525 BC to 402 BC. 
History.
The last pharaoh of the Twenty-Sixth dynasty, Psamtik III, was defeated by Cambyses II of Persia in the battle of Pelusium in the eastern Nile delta in 525 BC. Egypt was then joined with Cyprus and Phoenicia in the sixth satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire. Thus began the first period of Persian rule over Egypt (also known as the 27th Dynasty), which ended around 402 BC. 
After an interval of independence, during which three indigenous dynasties reigned (the 28th, 29th, and 30th dynasty), Artaxerxes III (358 BC) reconquered the Nile valley for a brief second period (343 BC), which is called the thirty-first dynasty of Egypt.

Trivett Wingo left the band just after the Warp Riders Tour had begun and was replaced with Kevin Fender, who played the rest of the dates until he was replaced in 2011 with Santiago "Jimmy" Vela III. The Sword signed a new record deal with Razor & Tie in March 2012, and their fourth album "Apocryphon" was released in October 2012.

Candice Bergen (politician)

Candice Marie Bergen, PC, MP (born September 28, 1964) is a Canadian federal politician, Minister of State for Social Development, and Member of the Canadian Parliament. She has represented the Manitoba riding of Portage—Lisgar in the House of Commons since her election in 2008 and is a member of the Conservative Party of Canada.
Elected under the name Candice Hoeppner, Ms. Bergen announced on September 17, 2012 that she would resume her birth name of Bergen.
Background.
Bergen was born in Morden, Manitoba. She previously worked in the financial planning industry. In 2004, she was the Manitoba campaign manager for Stephen Harper's leadership bid for the Conservative Party of Canada. She has acted as an advisor to several Members of Parliament, and served as chief organizer for the Conservative Party in Manitoba.
Political career.
On November 19, 2008, Bergen introduced the motion in the House of Commons to accept the Speech from the throne (the traditional speech in which the Governor General outlines the government's agenda at the start of a new Parliament). In fall 2011, Bergen was given the opportunity to chair a panel of MP’s (one from each recognized party) for the selection of Supreme Court judges. Bergen was also a member of the legislative committee studying Bill C-18 which would give marketing freedom to western grain farmers.
Previously, Bergen served as Chair of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities. She was the Vice-Chair of the Standing Committee for the Status of Women and sat on the House of Commons Standing Committee for Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. Additionally, she has been a member of the Liaison Committee as well as the Panel of Legislative Committee Chairs.
Bergen has been involved in several special Parliamentary groups. She was on the Executive on the Canada-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Group. She is also the former Chair of the Canada-Australia-New Zealand Parliamentary Friendship Group, in addition to sitting on a number of other parliamentary groups.
On May 15, 2009, Bergen introduced Bill C-391, An Act to Amend the Criminal Code and the Firearms Act, which would repeal the long-gun registry. On November 4, 2009, Bill C-391 passed second reading in the House of Commons by a vote of 164 to 137. When the bill was studied by the standing Committee of Public Safety and National Security, many different groups including police officers both serving and retired spoke out in support of Bill C-391.
On September 22, 2010, a Liberal motion to kill debate on Bill C-391 was passed 153-151, after six NDP MPs who backed Bergen's bill changed their votes, along with several Liberal MPs, enough to ensure the passage of the motion, keeping the registry alive.
On May 2, 2011, at the 41st Canadian General Election, Bergen was returned as Member of Parliament for Portage and Lisgar with 76.0 per cent of the vote, her closest rival winning only 9.8 per cent.
On May 25, 2011, Bergen was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Safety. In her role as Parliamentary Secretary, Bergen had the opportunity to work alongside the Minister of Public Safety on the Government Bill C-19, Ending the Long Gun Registry Act which became law on April 5, 2012.
On July 15, 2013, Bergen was appointed Minister of State (Social Development).

Moa Anbessa

Moa Anbessa is an album by Ethiopian saxophonist Getatchew Mekuria with Dutch post-punk band The Ex and guests, released in 2006 on The Ex's subsidiary label Terp. The project came together on the heels of The Ex's previous studio album "Turn", which incorporated elements of Eritrean and Congolese music alongside a tribute to the Ethiojazz anthems of Getatchew Mekuria. The Ex had toured Ethiopia twice and then invited Mekuria to perform at their 25th anniversary show in Amsterdam where he proposed that The Ex be the backup band for his next album. In addition to "Moa Anbessa", the collaboration yielded tours of Europe and North America as well as an official live DVD released by Buda Music, producers of the influential "Ethiopiques" series of ethiojazz compilations.
In addition to Mekuria and The Ex's core two-guitar/drums/vocals line up, "Moa Anbessa" and the tours surrounding it featured additional brass and reed work from Canadian alto sax player Brodie West, French clarinetist Xavier Charles, and Dutch trombonist Joost Buis who had previously played with the band in their Ex Orkest project. The Ex also reunited with Scottish bass player Colin McLean with whom they had toured and co-released records in the late 1980s when both McLean and Andy Moor were members of the Dog Faced Hermans.
Album title.
The name "Moa Anbessa", Amharic for "The Conquering Lion", refers to a political party made up of Ethiopians who support a constitutional monarchy. The party was created by exiled titular emperor Amha Selassie I to operate as the political wing of the crown. As an album title, it makes note both of Mekuria's support of the royal family, as well as his own "return to the throne" of Ethiopian jazz.

Typhoon Mitag (2007)

Typhoon Mitag (International designation: 0723; Joint Typhoon Warning Center designation: 24W; PAGASA designation: Mina) was a strong typhoon that caused deadly flooding in the Philippines.
Meteorological history.
Typhoon Mitag was first identified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on November 19, 2007 as an area of scattered convective activity situated roughly 410 km (255 mi) south-southwest of Guam. Located within a region of low wind shear and favoring good outflow, development of the system was anticipated over the following few days. Later that day, a low-level circulation was discovered as the disturbance became increasingly organized. Shortly thereafter, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Early on November 20, convective banding features developed along the periphery of the depression as it moved into an area of good divergence. Around 1200 UTC, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Mitag. This name was contributed by Micronesia and translates to "my eyes" and is also a name for a Yap woman. Several hours later, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Mitag, designating it as Tropical Storm 24W. Around the same time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issued their first advisory on the system as it entered their area of responsibility. They dubbed Mitag with the local Philippine name of Mina at this time.
The storm strengthened significantly early on November 21 and became a severe tropical storm. Later that day, the JTWC upgraded Mitag to a typhoon, and the JMA also upgraded it late that evening. As Mitag remained stationary in the Philippine Sea for a day as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon, it changed its course and instead of hitting Catanduanes and the Bicol Region, it will make a landfall at the Aurora-Isabela area. Nonetheless, PAGASA announced that there is still a possibility of the typhoon to once again change its course. The storm turned northwest towards northern Luzon and made landfall late on November 25. It tracked across the island and was downgraded to a severe tropical storm before emerging back over water on November 26. It turned back to the east before reaching Taiwan, and became extratropical on November 27.
Preparations.
On November 22, the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) of the Philippines took full precautions in advance of Typhoon Mitag. Only a tropical storm at the time, the NDCC ordered the evacuation of nearly 3,000 people and opened at least ten evacuation centers. Immediate standby funds of PHP3.2 million (US$67,000) and relief goods worth PHP41.1 million (US$860,700) were placed in the National Resource Operations Center. Trucks supplied with a combined 4,000 packs of clothing and 100 tents were prepped for immediate distribution after the storm. The Armed Forces of the Philippines placed five battalions, consisting of trucks, saws, boats, helicopters and naval ships to respond to reports of missing people and clear debris after the storm.
An estimated 300,000 people evacuated ahead of the storm from six provinces in Luzon. Roughly 15,000 people were also evacuated from Palanan. Hospital staff were placed on 24-hour standby to readily assist people injured by the storm. Typhoon Mitag became the most significant storm to threaten the country since Typhoon Durian one year prior. Thousands of residents were evacuated throughout 40 regions. The Government of the United States was on standby in Okinawa to immediately deploy assistance in fear of another major disaster. Roughly 30,000 people evacuated the Bicol Peninsula ahead of the storm. In Isabela province, 54,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas prone to flooding. Trucks with relief items, such as food and medicine, were stocked and prepped for immediate deployment.
Over 2,000 residents were evacuated from Albay Province by November 22. Officials reported that nearly 654,000 people had to be evacuated from the province, especially those near the Mayon Volcano. In Legazpi City, Camalig, Daraga, and Guinobatan towns over 9,000 people were evacuated due to the threat of lahars. Over 6,000 families were evacuated from Polangui town. Officials stated that there were at least 180,000 people in Albay that were at risk of being impacted by storm surge from Typhoon Mitag. More than 200,000 families were evacuated from Camarines Sur Province. Already impacted by Typhoon Hagibis, disaster officials requested PHP67 million (US$1.4 million) in funds for both storms. By November 23, officials urged over one million people to evacuate threatened areas as Typhoon Mitag was anticipated to become a very powerful typhoon.
Impact.
Philippines.
Typhoon Mitag produced torrential rainfall over the Philippines, triggering numerous landslides. At least 19 people were killed in landslides and eight others were reported as missing. These people were later confirmed to have died in landslides, seven of which occurred in Pinukpuk. Two people died of hypothermia and two others died from electrocution. Sixteen other fatalities resulted from drowning and one more from a flash flood. One landslide cut a portion of a major highway connecting Cagayan and Ilocos Norte.
A ship carrying 80 people capsized near the Nansha Islands on November 22. Fifty-five of the passengers were rescued; however, 25 remained missing. Hundreds of other fishermen were also presumed to be stranded on the islands during the storm. Rough seas produced by the storm also capsized two ferries, resulting in the drownings of three people. Thirty of the passengers were rescued while six others were listed as missing. A Philippine air force jet also went missing during their rescue mission near the capsized ships. The Coast Guard reported that there was no sign of either the ship or the plane during their search. Rescue attempts for the pilots were called off and they have been presumed dead.
Officials reported that 2,969 homes were destroyed and 17,950 others were damaged by the storm; a total of 779,930 people were affected. Throughout the country, damages to highways amounted to PHP162 million (US$3.79 million). Over 6,000 hectares of agricultural land was damaged or destroyed, leaving PHP109.6 million (US$2.56 million) in losses and damages to schools amounted to PHP210 million (US$4.93 million). Total damages from the storm amounted to PHP945 million (US$19.79 million).
Elsewhere.
On November 24, the outer bands of Mitag brought winds up to 50 km/h (30 mph) to parts of eastern Malaysia. The town of Tawau, was particularly hard-hit, with 85 homes sustaining damage, mainly to roofs. Trees and power lines were also downed by the high winds, but there were no reports of any injuries. Off the coast of Taiwan, an Indonesian cargo ship with 27 crew members sank due to waves produced by Mitag. One of the men were rescued; however, the remaining 26 were not found. Rescue attempts were later called off and the remaining crew were presumed dead. The remnants of Mitag contributed to heavy rains in Okinawa which damaged 3 km (1.8 mi) of roads and triggered one landslide. Winds on the island gusted up to 74 km/h (46 mph).
Aftermath.
Search and rescue teams were deployed immediately by the government to the hardest hit areas. A military contingent was deployed to three towns in northern Cagayan isolated by flood waters. The National Food Authority stocked roughly 600,000 bags of rice to assist victims of the storm. The
National Disaster Coordinating Council also provided 4,950 sacks of rice, worth PHP5 million (US$104,700) to the affected regions. By November 23, the provinces of Albay and Catanduanes declared a state of calamity due to the severity of damage. A week later, the Philippine Navy had already begun distributing food packs to the six regions affected by the typhoon. Military personnel were deployed throughout the country to reports of flash flooding, missing persons, evacuations and distribution of relief goods. Roughly PHP23.5 million (US$490,000) was provided by various agencies to assist victims of the storm.
On December 26, the Government of the Philippines announced that the Habitat for Humanity foundation was beginning construction of 495 shelters throughout the country. The total cost of the project was PHP42 million (US$879,500).

Gerson was Acting Attorney General from January 20, 1993, to March 12, 1993. He was in the position for two reasons: first, President Clinton's problems in finding an Attorney General during that period, and second, being fourth in the line of succession at the Justice Department (other senior DOJ officials had already resigned). During his time as Acting AG, Gerson supported the Brady bill and was in office during the beginnings of the Waco siege. Janet Reno, President Clinton's nominee for Attorney General, was confirmed on March 12, and he resigned the same day.

Saturnina

Saint Saturnina () is venerated as a Christian virgin martyr, “now believed to most likely be purely legendary.”
Legend.
Her legend states that she came from a noble German family (her father was a king), and that she took a vow of celibacy at the age of twelve. When her parents forced her into marriage when she turned twenty, she fled from Germany into France. The man to whom she had been promised, a Saxon lord, pursued her into France after receiving approval to do so from Saturnina's parents. He found her hiding with some shepherds at Arras; she had been working as a maidservant. He attempted to rape her, and when she resisted him, he decapitated her. 
The lord miraculously drowned in a fountain, and Saturnina then carried her own head in her hands, and as witnessed by the townspeople, carried her head to the church of St. Remi, which was in the next village: Sains-Les-Marquion. She was then buried there. Another tradition states that Saturnina placed her head on a stone at Sains-lès-Marquion, proclaiming herself to be the last human sacrifice the town would ever suffer.
Veneration.
At Sains-lès-Marquion, the local townspeople planted a tree next to the stone that represented the shepherd’s crook that she had carried, and a local tradition concerning Saturnina and her tree still exists. 
Some of her relics were translated to Saxony from Sains-lès-Marquion. They were translated to Neuenheerse in Bad Driburg, Saxony. The nuns there gathered many relics, including those of Saint Saturnina. 
The Stiftskirche St. Saturnina ("Convent church of St. Saturnina") in Neuenheerse (Eggedom), Bad Driburg, was built from 1100 to 1130, but was heavily damaged in a fire due to lightning in 1965.
Writers compiling the lives of Saints Romana and Benedicta copied Saturnina’s legend, according to Adrien Baillet.

Red Bridge (border)

Red Bridge (; , "Tsiteli Khidi") is the crossing point between Georgia and Azerbaijan on the Tbilisi to Ganja road. The term translates into English as Red Bridge, and is so named because there is a red-brick bridge arch bridge across the Khrami River in the no-man's land area between the border posts. The bridge's current structure is mostly 17th century, but there has been a bridge on the site since the 12th century crossing. The 'red' bridge was in day to day use up until 1998, when a new and considerably larger bridge was completed as part of the TRACECA (Europe-Caucasus-Asia) project.
Red Bridge Market.
Throughout the 1990s there was a large no-man's land market here largely operated by ethnic Azerbaijanis from Georgia's Marneuli area. The market was controversially closed in spring 2006 as part of Georgia's anti-smuggling campaign, a move that was seen by some of Georgia's ethnic Azerbaijanis as designed to encourage them to leave (and relocate to Azerbaijan).

Thirty-first Dynasty of Egypt

The Thirty-first Dynasty of Egypt also known as the Second Egyptian Satrapy was effectively a short-living province of the Achaemenid Persian Empire between 343 BC to 332 BC. 
After an interval of independence, during which three indigenous dynasties reigned (the 28th, 29th, and 30th dynasty), Artaxerxes III (358–338 BC) reconquered the Nile valley for a brief second period (343–332 BC), which is called the Thirty-first Dynasty of Egypt.
History.
It is not known who served as satrap after Artaxerxes III, but under Darius III (336–330 BC) there was Sabaces, who fought and died at Issus and was succeeded by Mazaces. Egyptians also fought at Issus, for example, the nobleman Somtutefnekhet of Heracleopolis, who described on the "Naples stele" how he escaped during the battle against the Greeks and how Arsaphes, the god of his city, protected him and allowed him to return home. 
In 332 BC Mazaces handed over the country to Alexander the Great without a fight. The Achaemenid empire had ended, and for a while Egypt was a satrapy in Alexander's empire. Later the Ptolemies and the Romans successively ruled the Nile valley.

Guanoalca

Guanoalca (or Huenualca) (died 1590) was the Mapuche Toqui elected in 1586 following the death in battle of the previous toqui Cadeguala, killed in a duel with the garrison commander of the Spanish fort at Puren in 1586. He returned to continue the siege and forced the Spanish to evactuate the fort which he then destroyed.
He then directed his army against the Spanish fort newly built on the heights of Marihueñu but finding it too strongly held to attack he diverted his attacks against the newly established fort of Espíritu Santo, in the valley of Catirai where the Tavolevo River meets the Bio Bio River and the fort of Santísima Trinidad on the opposite shore. The governor Alonso de Sotomayor, evacuated Trinidad in 1591.
While he was Toqui in the south near Villa Rica, the female leader Janequeo lead Mapuche and Pehuenche warriors against the Spanish.
The old Toqui Guanoalca died at the end of 1590, and in 1591, Quintuguenu, was his successor.

River City Casino (New Orleans)

River City Casino was a twin riverboat casino complex (Grand Palais and Crescent City Queen) in New Orleans, Louisiana, located one block upriver from New Orleans Morial Convention Center.
It was the brainchild of Christopher Hemmeter (operating the Grand Palais riverboat) with a 50/50 joint venture with Capital Gaming International (operating the Crescent City Queen riverboat). The two riverboat complex partially circumvented Louisiana state law (repealed in 2001) requiring riverboat gaming vessels to make the required 90 minute cruise once every three hour period weather permitting. There would always be at least one vessel docked while the other would sail so patrons would never have to wait in line to board a gaming vessel. The riverboats opened for only nine weeks from March 29 - June 13, 1995. The terminal building complex was still in the ongoing interior construction phase when casino revenue was far below projections, additional funding was not secured and work was abruptly halted with construction tools, blueprints and materials left in place.
Bankruptcy.
The riverboats and its licenses were eventually sold off and transferred to other companies. Isle of Capri in Lake Charles acquired the Grand Palais (with license) in 1996. Isle's parent company, Casino America paid $55 million for the Grand Palais Riverboat in January 1996, with a package of cash, notes, stock, warrants, and by assuming $10 million of Grand Palais' existing liabilities. Boomtown Casino New Orleans acquired the Crescent City Queen riverboat without license in 1998 (renamed as Boomtown Belle II) to replace the smaller Boomtown Belle riverboat. Crescent City Queen's gaming license was transferred in 1996 to Casino Magic, which then operated a docked riverboat casino in Bossier City, later renamed Boomtown Bossier City. Boomtown's parent company, Pinnacle Entertainment revived the River City Casino name for its newest property in the St. Louis, Missouri area when it opened in March 2010.
Current status of riverboat terminal complex.
After being shuttered since its closure in June 1995, the terminal building complex was acquired by Mardi Gras World owner Blaine Kern in early 2008 and converted to the Eastbank location of Mardi Gras World. The acquisition has more than quadrupled Mardi Gras World's floor space. After more than 13 years of dormancy, the terminal finally saw new life during the Krewe of Boo inaugural parade on Halloween night 2008. The terminal was also the site of the Gulf Aid benefit concert with Lenny Kravitz as the headlining act during the BP oil spill crisis on May 16, 2010. Mardi Gras World's original location continues to operate in Algiers directly across the Mississippi River from the French Quarter.
In popular culture.
The Crescent City Queen riverboat was featured in an episode of the USA Network TV series The Big Easy in 1996 while it was still docked at the shuttered River City Casino terminal complex. The interior of the CCQ was also used in the pilot episode of the short lived CBS TV series Orleans starring Larry Hagman in 1997. In the movie Déjà Vu, the white terminal complex could be briefly seen in the background with a cruise ship docked next to it in the scene where Denzel Washington and Val Kilmer investigate the Canal Street Ferry explosion underneath the Crescent City Connection bridge.

<doc id="19362554" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19362554" title="Mossyrock Dam">
Mossyrock Dam

Mossyrock Dam is a concrete arch-gravity dam on the Cowlitz River near Mossyrock in Lewis County, Washington. The reservoir created by the dam is called Riffe Lake and the primary purpose of the dam is hydroelectric production while flood control is secondary. The dam is the tallest in Washington State and its hydroelectric power station supplies 40% of Tacoma Power's electricity.
History.
The Mossy Rock Dam was originally planned in the 1940s but opposition from local fishers and Washington State's Game Department delayed construction. During World War II, the city of Tacoma purchased its electricity from the Bonneville Power Administration and Seattle which would cost as much as $1 million a year. To generate its own electricity, Tacoma City Light, now known as Tacoma Power would build several dams including the Mossyrock Dam. Plans for the Mossyrock Dam were announced in 1948 but met stiff opposition. The Washington State Legislature enacted a fish sanctuary on the Cowlitz River that initially blocked the project. The City of Tacoma then went to court and after the case was before the U.S. Supreme Court three times, the dam was approved. Construction began in 1965 and ended in 1968. On October 13, 1968, the dam's power plant generated its first electricity.
Power plant.
The Mossyrock Dam's power plant contains 2 x 150 MW Francis turbine hydroelectric generators totaling a 300 MW capacity. The generators are fed by three penstocks ranging from 248 – 285 ft. feet long. One of the three penstocks is unused as the plant has an additional space for one more generator.
Power plant upgrade.
In 2006, GE Energy was selected to upgrade both of the power plant's generators. The $50 million project included replacing the turbines, stators, wicket gates and transformers among other improvements. Installation of the first generator began in 2008 and was completed and commissioned in 2009. The second generator was completed in late 2010. The power plant upgrade increased the total capacity by 70 MW and it should operate around 95% efficiency.

Catherine (1986 TV series)

Catherine - a French TV series produced for Antenne 2 channel in 1986. It was based on the series of "Catherine" novels written by Juliette Benzoni. The series was directed by Marion Sarraut, who had already successfully brought on TV another of Madame Benzoni's work - "Marianne". The director had the author's assistance going so far as working together, like mother and daughter, to work on the best-seller "Catherine". Two years of preparation, fifteen months of shooting, two hundred actors - over fifteen hundred costumes. The episodes were not to be seen in prime time - but from 13:30 - 14:00 each afternoon. The production was nevertheless a huge success. The readers of the books were more than satisfied with what Marion Sarraut had done to "Catherine". To their great joy, the producers had adapted the seven books more or less truthfully. Some minor changes had to be made, probably also because of the small bugdet they had at their disposal. Claudine Ancelot was a perfect Catherine. At her side, Pierre-Marie Escourrou as her great love Arnaud de Montsalvy. Pascale Petit (2) was Sara, Benoît Brione was the evil Gilles de Rais, and Geneviève Casile Queen Yolande. 
For over two decades, the story of "Catherine and Arnaud" had vanished. In December 2007 the French company France Loisirs started releasing the long awaited "Catherine Il suffit d'un amour" TV-Serie on DVD. At the moment the whole TV series has been released on 5 double DVDs.

Treaty of Versailles (1768)

The Treaty of Versailles was concluded on May 15, 1768 at Versailles between the Republic of Genoa and France. Genoa put Corsica in pledge to France.
Corsica had been ruled by Genoa since 1284. In the 18th century Corsicans started to seek their independence. A German adventurer, Theodore von Neuhof, briefly became King of Corsica in 1736, supported by the Dutch Republic and Great Britain, which already possessed Minorca and Gibraltar in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1755 a full-fledged Corsican Republic was founded under Pasquale Paoli, and in 1764 Genoa asked France to send troops. France occupied the Corsican harbours and fortresses in order to control the rebellious population, but also to prevent the island falling into British hands.
In the Treaty of Versailles Genoa had no option but to put Corsica in pledge to France, to repay her debts. There was no chance that Genoa, which was in decline, could ever repay her debts otherwise, nor was Genoa capable of suppressing the Corsican struggle for independence. 
In September 1768 France began the French Conquest of Corsica. France gained full military control of the island following the Battle of Ponte Novu in 1769, and until the French Revolution, the island was considered the personal possession of the King of France.

Sandro del Prete

Sandro Del-Prete (born 1937) is a Swiss artist who paints figures, situations and processes that cannot exist in the real world. Del-Prete ‘materializes the well-known psychological effect, of the difference between ‘looking’ (usually the first glace of an observer) and ‘seeing’ (when things are appreciated more thoroughly in the mind)’ – Abraham Tamir. Comparisons can be drawn between Del-Prete and Escher’s artwork, although they differ in subject matter, style, mood and technique. Del-Prete greatly admires Escher and believes that they are ‘kindred spirits’, however the viewer will find very little mathematical precision in Del-Prete’s work, something that is always present in Escher’s work.
Biography.
Del-Prete was born in Bern, Switzerland in 1937 and went to school in Fribourg, Switzerland. When he had completed his schooling at his father’s bidding, and had saved enough, Del-Prete finally decided to dedicate himself to his passion, painting. When he was twenty-three Del-Prete spent six months in Florence, Italy, where he attended the Florence Academy of Art. He studied the techniques of light and shadow, form design, colour and the structural elements of the old masters such as Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Rubens. When he returned to Switzerland, Del-Prete immersed himself in creating religious and symbolic art. Del-Prete never tried to sell his work but looked at it as a hobby, and started a career in the insurance industry to support his family. During this period, Del-Prete experimented with drawing, painting and sculpture.
Del-Prete’s interest in Illusionism sprang from his observation of a chameleon. He wondered ‘what the animal really saw, what picture it had of its own world’. He began to look upon different perspectives and in the early 1960s began creating illustrations that would lead to his later ‘illusiry’ images. Del-Prete began to experiment, drawing scenes and objects that could be looked at from two different viewpoints. From that experiment arose a new type of illusionism, whereby ‘normal terms like front, back, top, bottom, right, and left could no longer be used’. His earliest drawing from this period, which draws upon double-perspective, is ‘Window Gazing’ completed in 1961.
Del-Prete experimented with other illusions where objects broke free of their picture frames and into the surrounding environment, and ‘ambiguous images’, where the meaning altered between two different perceptions.
In 1981 Del-Prete published privately his first collection of black and white pencil drawings. It was successful enough for him to publish a second collection in 1987.
His passion and hard work started to pay off and in 1984 he had a groundbreaking exhibition of his illusionary art at the Phenomena Show in Zurich. He started to devote all his time to the creation of illusionary images and in the same year he opened up a gallery in Bern, which was highly successful. A few years later, he created his own illusion themed fun house and art gallery, Illusoria-Land, located in Ittigen, Switzerland.
Legacy.
Although a number of art critics have found fault with Del-Prete’s technical craftsmanship, his ‘impossible’ images are highly original. Unfortunately, several artists borrowed heavily from Del-Prete’s illusionary drawings and concepts without acknowledging their source.

Don Hayward (30 July 1925 - 16 February 1999) was a Welsh international prop who played club rugby for Newbridge. He won 15 caps for Wales and was selected to play in the British Lions on the 1950 tour of Australia and New Zealand. Hayward is considered to be one of the finest forwards to represent Wales in the early post-war period. He was an excellent lineout specialist and was an aggressive mauler in the loose. Hayward was also an extremely strong tackler and played with total conviction.
Rugby career.
Born in 1925 in Pontypool and played for 'second class' team Newbridge, who before 1939 would rarely be selected for Welsh trials, but this changed after World War II. With an improved list of opponents, and an impressive roster of players, Newbridge gained trials for several of its players including Hayward and Ray Cale who were both selected. Hayward was first selected for Wales in 1949 after Rees Stephens pulled out of the game against England. Although Stephens regained his place, Hayward was back in the 1950 season and held his place throughout the Five Nations Championships in 1950 through to 1953.
In 1951, Hayward faced the touring South Africans on two occasions, as part of the Welsh pack, and also as part of a joint Newbridge / Pontypool side. Although Newbridge were beaten by the Springboks, it was an historic game and Hayward proved a formidable opponent.
Hayward would later emigrate to New Zealand, but returned to Britain to play rugby league.
International matches played.
Wales
British Lions.
During the 1950 British Lions tour Hayward was over-selected in the early games, playing in the first three tests against New Zealand, but looked tired in the third test and was far below his normal form. In total he played 18 matches on the tour.

Khokana, a traditional and tiny Newari village about eight kilometers south of Kathmandu (on the outskirts of Patan), which has its own history and has retained its tradition and culture. It is a living museum and recalls medieval times. The farming community of Newars who live here are mostly dependent on agriculture and much of their daily activities take place outside of their dwellings. 
There are women sitting outside spinning, men crushing seeds, and other daily activities. The village is famous for its unusual mustard-oil harvesting process in which a heavy wooden beam is used to crush the mustard seeds in order to extract the oil. It is believed that a share system was used in the past here. This oil can be consumed if desired, but it can also be used for therapeutic massage. This was also the first village, indeed the first habitation, to be electrified, before Kathmandu.
In the center is a three-storey temple, Shree Rudrayani, with a particularly wide main street, especially for a village of such small size. Khokana has been nominated to be listed as a Unesco World Heritage, representing a vernacular village and its mustard-oil seed industrial heritage.
"Khokana is a unique village which can be taken as a model of a medieval settlement pattern with a system of drainage and chowks. It houses chaityas and a Mother Goddess temple. The mustard-oil seed industry has become the living heritage of the village." 
In January the Khokana festival is held to showcase the unique aspects of the village. Cultural Newari dances, such as the Thimi dance and Devi dance, Newar food, such as Newar pancake (woh), a sweet steamed dumpling filled with molasses and sesame (yomari) and strong Nepali wine (ayla), crafts, music and the towns mustard production were all on display.

Jan van Oort

Jan van Oort (Amsterdam, 13 April 1921 – Arnhem, 29 November 2006) was a Dutch children's book writer and comic strip cartoonist, working under the pseudonym of Jean Dulieu. He is known for his creation of "Paulus the woodgnome".
Personal biography.
Jan van Oort was born on 13 April 1921 in Amsterdam. He was the son of concert singer Hendrik C. van Oort, and grandson of the political cartoonist Johan Braakensiek. Van Oort was into music, and creative activities such as drawing and puppet making.
Jan van Oort studied the violin on the conservatorium where he graduated in 1940, and became violinist with the Amsterdam Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. During the Dutch famine of 1944, the orchestra was decommissioned, allowing Van Oort more time for drawing. While living at the time in Soest, he made twelve designs of gnomes, and let his wife Kitty Sijmons pick the best one. This one he elaborated to a full-blown children's book character and named him Paulus.
Shortly after the war, Van Oort and his family moved to Terschelling, and a year later ended his participation in the orchestra, aiming for a full job in comics strips, although having no education in this field.
In 1984 when he was 63, he finished his cartoonist career. Van Oort died in 2006 in Arnhem, at the age of 85. In September of that year, his daughter Dorinde van Oort published a novel about her family, where her father is named "Lepel Mansborg".

Paulus the woodgnome was published from 1946 onward in the daily newspaper Het Vrije Volk. Van Oort used the pseudonym of Jean Dulieu, the literal French translation of Jan van Oort, to protect a possible image loss to his violinist career in case of failure in his cartooning work. In total, Van Oort created approximately 3600 comic strips for this newspaper.
In 1948, the first illustrated Paulus children's books were published, including "Paulus the deputy Sint Nicolas" and "the Paulus winterbook", the latter having even coloured illustrations. During the years more publications followed, including "Paulus and Eucalypta", "Paulus and the dragon", and "Paulus and Skipper Mackarel". In 1964, he published his masterpiece "Paulus and the acorn men", with many colour illustrations and the death theme. Various books by Dulieu have been translated to English, German, South-African, Japanese and Swedish.
Paulus in other media.
In the period 1955 to 1964, "Paulus the woodgnome" was broadcast as radio drama. Van Oort did all the voices himself, with the exception of Princess Priegeltje, which was done by his daughter Dorinde van Oort. Starting 1967, Van Oort made 39 puppet movies of 10 minutes each for the Dutch television programme "Monitor". He created all puppets, scenery and accessories by himself. These movies were also broadcast in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada and Australia.
In the 1970s, Van oort started a new series of newspaper comic strips, totalling 23 full stories. In 1984 when he was 63, he finished his last Paulus. 
Even in 2008, new Paulus books are still being published, based on so far unpublished material, by De Meulder Publishers.
Other publications.
Besides Paulus, Van Oort created for Albert Heijn a book "Boffie and Buikie in a tie", an album for which 96 paper strips could be collected from Albert Heijn shop purchases.
Following travels to Italy, Van Oort published in 1953 the book "Francesco" about Francis of Assisi.
Awards.
Van Oorts book "Paulus the deputy Sint Nicolas" was Best Children's Book in 1962, and he received an Edison award for a grammophone record of one of his Paulus stories. 
His full career as comic strips cartoonist was awarded the Stripschapsprijs in 1981.
Since 1995, the Paulus Archives are collecting and publishing the life and works of Jean Dulieu and Paulus the woodgnome, notably via the magazine "Bouterbode".

Too Many Fish in the Sea

"Too Many Fish in the Sea" is a 1964 hit song recorded by Motown singing group The Marvelettes. It was the group's first top 40 pop hit in almost a year reaching number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was one of the first hit singles written by Norman Whitfield and was also written by Eddie Holland. "Too Many Fish..." was also Whitfield's first produced single.
This single is the only one where group members Georgeanna Tillman and Katherine Anderson had a lead on the A-side. Sadly, this is also the final A-side appearance for Tillman, who would leave the group in very early 1965 due to her illnesses, before they recorded their next single, "I'll Keep Holding On". This would also be the last single in which Gladys Horton would lead on the A-side, as Wanda Young Rogers (who also led on this and the two pervious singles) would be the group's sole lead on the A-side, relegating Horton to B-side leads. Norman Whitfield would later use similar vocal techniques with The Temptations on hit songs such as "I Can't Get Next To You" and "Cloud Nine"

Through constant work and participation in tournaments and the Bundesliga South, not only the Lacrosse skills augmented, but also the number of team members. Especially through the cooperation with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology many new players joined the team. With growing experience and through the help of their new coach, the team improved its position in the league and reached the 4th place in the Bundeslige South in 2012. 
The team wear colors are black and pink, which is the reason for the women's team name "Black Strom". Every game starts and ends with the team members performing their team slogan "1,2,3 - Black Strom - Woohoo".

Dodderhill

Dodderhill is a village and civil parish, near Droitwich, Worcestershire, England, located on the River Salwarpe. The parish is bisected by the M5 motorway, constructed in 1962. It is home to the Droitwich transmitting station in Wychbold. 
One of the earliest mentions of Dodderhill is of the Saxon Royal Palace recorded in the Saxon Charter of AD 692. 
There was once a Roman fort and later an Anglo-Saxon church. The parish church of St. Augustine's, is on the hill overlooking Droitwich Spa. It was completed in 1220 and rebuilt in the 18th century. A possible ley tunnel is said by archeologists to lead from St Augustine’s, to Friar Street Droitwich Spa, part of a system of tunnels linking St Augustine’s and St Andrew’s churches. (This 'tunnel' seems unlikely as it does not appear to have been located or mentioned when the railway and/or canal was built unless built after this time.
Notable people associated with Dodderhill include the MP Thomas Vernon, part of whose family estate was located in the parish; the royalist Sir Thomas Nott, who bought the manors of Sagebury and Obden in Dodderhill in 1637; and the 'Salt King' and philanthropist John Corbett who built the Chateau Impney in 1873
There is one school associated with the area which is known as Dodderhill School. This is a private (fee paying) school for girls only from age 3 to 16 years. The senior school is housed in the old vicarage of the church shown above. As of 2010 there are around 200 girls.

Sankhu

Sankhu (alternative name: Sakwa (Nepal Bhasa: सक्व)) is a place made of combination of different parts of three Village Development Committees, Bajrayogini, Pukhulachhi, and Suntol, in Kathmandu District in the Bagmati Zone of central Nepal. At the time of the 1991 Nepal census it had a population of 2097 living in 353 individual households.
This place is also known as the Eighty Siddhas as there are four of five caves where the siddhas of India are said to have stayed. One of the caves is also said to have been the practice cave of Nagarjuna, and an image of the great master which was originally in the cave has been taken outside and placed some distance away.
The present temple was built by Raja Prakas Malla in 1655. It enshrines the main sacred representations of this site, Ugra-tara manifesting as Ekazati, which are said to give very powerful blessings, particularly the image in the upper temple. The image in the lower temple is red in colour with one face and four arms, two of which hold a skull-cup (kapala) and knife at her heart, and the remaining two hold a sword and an utpala lotus. In the upper temple is an identical image of Ugra-tara in bell metal, in which her left leg is outstretched. In the upper temple is the loom of the Nepali Princess Brhikuti, spouse of the Tibetan king Songtsen Gampo. In both the upper and lower temples, Vajrayogini is flanked Baghini and Singhini, the Tiger and Lion-headed Yoginis. In the same upper room in the upper temple is a solid bronze standing Buddha and a standing Lokeshvara. Below this shrine room is a small room containing self-arisen (swayambhu) stupa in stone.
On the hill behind there is a courtyard in the centre of which is a basin containing the “Water of the Kalpa” which never dries up. In the building immediately to the left of the stairs, there is also an eternal fire or “Fire of the Kalpa”. Further up, on top of the hill, is the Mani-linga.
Nearby villages include Palubari.
Religion and pilgrimage.
In the Kathmandu Valley Padmasambhava made a pilgrimage to Sankhu where he met Shakyadevi and took her to Yangleshö. Vairotsana, leaving Tibet after his teachings were slandered, stopped in Nepal and offered a golden icon to the monastery of Sankhu. Guru Rinpoche left a number of termas in Sankhu and around.
Sankhu is also the site of the month long worship to the Goddess Swasthani. The Swasthani Purnima is a tribute to the Goddess through fasting, meditation and ritual bathing, mainly by women. It begins on the full moon of the Nepali month of Magh and ends on the full moon of the Nepali month of Phagun.
Women spend 31 days at the temple, sleeping, eating and meditating. It is believed women who perform this puja will have their wish granted. Outside the temple, the riverbank of the Sali Nadi is thought to be the site where Goddess Parvati bathed during her month of meditations dedicated to Swasthani.

David Mocatta (1806–1882) was a British architect and a member of the Anglo-Jewish Mocatta family.
Biography.
Mocatta studied in London from 1821 to 1827 under Sir John Soane and then travelled in Italy. 
Mocatta was the architect of the London and Brighton Railway, designing seven italianate railway stations. Mocatta also designed balustrades and a set of eight Italianate pavilions to ornament John Urpeth Rastrick's Ouse Valley Viaduct for the L&BR.
His synagogue in Ramsgate for Moses Montefiore (1833) was possibly the first in England to be designed by a Jewish architect. The West London Synagogue of British Jews commissioned Mocatta to design both their temporary premises in Burton Street (1841) and their building in Margaret Street (1851). The latter was a substantial structure, seating 400 and costing more than £4,000. 
He was elected a Fellow of the Institute of British Architects (later the RIBA) in 1836, and was an early member of its council. In later years he became Senior Trustee of the Soane Museum. He was a founder member of the West London Synagogue eventually becoming chairman of its council. He retired from architecture early, having inherited the family fortunes. 
Mocatta House, a modern office development in Trafalgar Place, Brighton is named after him.

Penterry

Penterry () is a small rural parish of in Monmouthshire, Wales. It is located between the villages of St. Arvans and Tintern, about north of Chepstow, within the Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and about from the border with England. It now contains an isolated parish church adjoining the site of a deserted village, and a few farms.
History.
The first evidence of human habitation in the parish is a hill fort at Gaer Hill. This provides a panoramic and strategically important view towards the Severn estuary, and is believed to have been an Iron Age base and lookout point for the Silures. Because of its similarities with another monument on Holyhead Mountain in Anglesey, it is thought possible that the inner earthwork is a Roman signal station lying within an earlier defensive enclosure. 
Although the area is now quite remote, Penterry was originally located beside the Roman road (locally called Piccadilly) between the Severn estuary in the south and the small fort at "Blestium", now Monmouth. The ancient road was superseded in later centuries, other than for local traffic, by that through Devauden to the west (now the B4293), and in the 19th century by the turnpike road through Tintern to the east (now the A466). 
The church at Penterry is dedicated to St. Mary, and is located in an isolated position within a field. It was first mentioned in a charter in 955 AD. By the 13th century part of the parish had become a grange of nearby Tintern Abbey. In some documents the grange is described as a Secular Firmary, suggesting that it either housed or maintained a hospital for local people. Its distance from the abbey - about - may have been to guard against the spread of infection. The present church was largely rebuilt in the mid-19th century, but retains two medieval windows and the base of a stone cross. 
The area is believed to have been severely affected by the Black Death, and a grove of trees near the church has been identified as a plague pit. The remains of house platforms and gardens can still be seen under the turf in the field south of the church. 
The local population again declined during the 19th century, because of a fall in demand for labour to work in the nearby woods. The parish had 60 residents in 1821, but only 20 in 1911.

His musical theaters have been performed over 2000 times.
He was taught music by the Croatian composer Rudolf Matz and later enrolled the Vatroslav Lisinski music school. Roger Samyn helped him brush up his composing skills. Although he received a degree on the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Zagreb, Alfi Kabiljo has never made use of it. He has spent most of his life in the Zagreb neighborhood of Šalata, although he stayed in Paris for a short while. Kabiljo is a former president of the Croatian Composers' Society () and a member of the FIDOF organization.
Alfi wrote his first song when he was eight years old. 
Since then, he has written soundtracks for various films, including the 1991 film "Scissors", starring Sharon Stone and Ronny Cox, and the 1986 film "The Girl". He has also written soundtracks for over 100 television episodes, including the Croatian TV mini-series "Ljubav ili smrt", based on a novel by Ivan Kušan, the TV series "Ne daj se Floki", and series about the famous inventor Nikola Tesla. 
His songs have been sung by award-winning singers such as Ivo Robić and Tereza Kesovija. Kabiljo is the author of one of the greatest Croatian patriotic songs, "Tvoja zemlja", which was performed by Vice Vukov.
Kabiljo's best-selling and best known work is the musical "Jalta, Jalta", for which he received the 2004 Porin award for the magnum opus. To date, the musical has been released in audio format three times and it had its first premiere in 1971. All three releases have been sold out decades ago.

Geometric calculus

In mathematics, geometric calculus extends the geometric algebra to include differentiation and integration. The formalism is powerful and can be shown to encompass other mathematical theories including differential geometry and differential forms.
Differentiation.
With a geometric algebra given, let "a" and "b" be vectors and let "F(a)" be a multivector-valued function. The directional derivative of "F(a)" along "b" is defined as
provided that the limit exists, where the limit is taken for scalar "ε". This is similar to the usual definition of a directional derivative but extends it to functions that are not necessarily scalar-valued.
Next, choose a set of basis vectors formula_2 and let formula_3, where we use the Einstein summation notation. This allows the geometric derivative to be treated as an operator
which is independent of the choice of frame. This is similar to the usual definition of the gradient, but it, too, extends to functions that are not necessarily scalar-valued.
The standard order of operations for the geometric derivative is that it acts only on the function closest to its immediate right. Given two functions "F" and "G", then for example we have
Product rule.
Although the partial derivative exhibits a product rule, the geometric derivative only partially inherits this property. Consider two functions "F" and "G":
Since the geometric product is not commutative with formula_7 in general, we cannot proceed further without new notation. A solution is to adopt the "overdot notation", in which the scope of a geometric derivative with an overdot is the multivector-valued function sharing the same overdot. In this case, if we define
then the product rule for the geometric derivative is
Interior and exterior derivative.
Let "F" be an "r"-grade multivector. Then we can define an additional pair of operators, the interior and exterior derivatives,
In particular, if "F" is grade 1 (vector-valued function), then we can write
and identify the divergence and curl as
Note, however, that these two operators are considerably weaker than the geometric derivative counterpart for several reasons. Neither the interior derivative operator nor the exterior derivative operator is invertible. Unlike the exterior product, the exterior derivative is not even associative.
Integration.
Let formula_15 be a set of basis vectors that span an "n"-dimensional vector space. From geometric algebra, we interpret the pseudoscalar formula_16 to be the signed volume of the "n"-parallelotope subtended by these basis vectors. If the basis vectors are orthonormal, then this is the unit pseudoscalar.
More generally, we may restrict ourselves to a subset of "k" of the basis vectors, where formula_17, to treat the length, area, or other general "k"-volume of a subspace in the overall "n"-dimensional vector space. We denote these selected basis vectors by formula_18. A general "k"-volume of the "k"-parallelotope subtended by these basis vectors is the grade "k" multivector formula_19.
Even more generally, we may consider a new set of vectors formula_20 proportional to the "k" basis vectors, where each of the formula_21 is a component that scales one of the basis vectors. We are free to choose components as infinitesimally small as we wish as long as they remain nonzero. Since the outer product of these terms can be interpreted as a "k"-volume, a natural way to define a measure is
The measure is therefore always proportional to the unit pseudoscalar of a "k"-dimensional subspace of the vector space. Compare the Riemannian volume form in the theory of differential forms. The integral is taken with respect to this measure:
More formally, consider some directed volume "V" of the subspace. We may divide this volume into a sum of simplices. Let formula_24 be the coordinates of the vertices. At each vertex we assign a measure formula_25 as the average measure of the simplices sharing the vertex. Then the integral of "F(x)" with respect to "U(x)" over this volume is obtained in the limit of finer partitioning of the volume into smaller simplices:
formula_26
Fundamental theorem of geometric calculus.
The reason for defining the geometric derivative and integral as above is that they allow a strong generalization of Stokes' theorem. Let formula_27 be a multivector-valued function of "r"-grade input "A" and general position "x", linear in its first argument. Then the fundamental theorem of geometric calculus relates the integral of a derivative over the volume "V" to the integral over its boundary:
As an example, let formula_28 for a vector-valued function "F(x)" and a ("n"-1)-grade multivector "A". We find that
and likewise
Thus we recover the divergence theorem,
Covariant derivative.
A sufficiently smooth "k"-surface in an "n"-dimensional space is deemed a manifold. To each point on the manifold, we may attach a "k"-blade "B" that is tangent to the manifold. Locally, "B" acts as a pseudoscalar of the "k"-dimensional space. This blade defines a projection of vectors onto the manifold:
Just as the geometric derivative formula_33 is defined over the entire "n"-dimensional space, we may wish to define an "intrinsic derivative" formula_34, locally defined on the manifold:
If "a" is a vector tangent to the manifold, then indeed both the geometric derivative and intrinsic derivative give the same directional derivative:
Although this operation is perfectly valid, it is not always useful because formula_38 itself is not necessarily on the manifold. Therefore we define the "covariant derivative" to be the forced projection of the intrinsic derivative back onto the manifold:
Since any general multivector can be expressed as a sum of a projection and a rejection, in this case
we introduce a new function, the shape tensor formula_41, which satisfies
where formula_43 is the commutator product. In a local coordinate basis formula_2 spanning the tangent surface, the shape tensor is given by
Importantly, on a general manifold, the covariant derivative does not commute. In particular, the commutator is related to the shape tensor by
Clearly the term formula_47 is of interest. However it, like the intrinsic derivative, is not necessarily on the manifold. Therefore we can define the Riemann tensor to be the projection back onto the manifold:
Lastly, if "F" is of grade "r", then we can define interior and exterior covariant derivatives as
and likewise for the intrinsic derivative.
Relation to differential geometry.
On a manifold, locally we may assign a tangent surface spanned by a set of basis vectors formula_2. We can associate the components of a metric tensor, the Christoffel symbols, and the Riemann tensor as follows:
These relations embed the theory of differential geometry within geometric calculus.
Relation to differential forms.
In a local coordinate system ("x"1, ..., "x""n"), the coordinate differentials d"x"1, ..., d"x""n" form a basic set of one-forms within the coordinate chart. Given a multi-index with for , we can define a "k"-form 
We can alternatively introduce a "k"-grade multivector "A" as
and a measure
Apart from a subtle difference in meaning for the exterior product with respect to differential forms versus the exterior product with respect to vectors (indeed one should note that in the former the "increments" are covectors, whereas in the latter they represent scalars), we see the correspondences of the differential form
its derivative
and its Hodge dual
embed the theory of differential forms within geometric calculus.

Multiplicative calculus

In mathematics, a multiplicative calculus is a system with two multiplicative operators, called a "multiplicative derivative" and a "multiplicative integral", which are inversely related in a manner analogous to the inverse relationship between the derivative and integral in the classical calculus of Newton and Leibniz. The multiplicative calculi provide alternatives to the classical calculus, which has an additive derivative and an additive integral.
There are infinitely many non-Newtonian multiplicative calculi, including the geometric calculus and the bigeometric calculus discussed below. These calculi all have a derivative and/or integral that is not a linear operator.
The geometric calculus is useful in biomedical image analysis.
Multiplicative derivatives.
Geometric calculus.
The "classical derivative" is
The "geometric derivative" is
This simplifies to
for functions where the statement is meaningful. Notice that the exponent in the preceding expression represents the well-known logarithmic derivative.
In the geometric calculus, the exponential functions are the functions having a constant derivative. Furthermore, just as the arithmetic average (of functions) is the 'natural' average in the classical calculus, the well-known geometric average is the 'natural' average in the geometric calculus.
Bigeometric calculus.
A similar definition to the geometric derivative is the "bigeometric derivative"
This simplifies to
for functions where the statement is meaningful. Notice that the exponent in the preceding expression represents the well-known elasticity concept, which is widely used in economics.
In the bigeometric calculus, the power functions are the functions having a constant derivative. Furthermore, the bigeometric derivative is scale invariant (or scale free), i.e., it is invariant under all changes of scale (or unit) in function arguments and values.
Multiplicative integrals.
Each multiplicative derivative has an associated multiplicative integral. For example, the geometric derivative and the bigeometric derivative are inversely-related to the geometric integral and the bigeometric integral, respectively.
Of course, each multiplicative integral is a multiplicative operator, but some product integrals are not multiplicative operators. (See Product integral#Basic definitions.)
Discrete calculus.
Just as differential equations have a discrete analog in difference equations with the forward difference operator replacing the derivative, so too there is the forward ratio operator "f"("x" + 1)/"f"("x") and recurrence relations can be formulated using this operator. See also Indefinite product.
History.
Between 1967 and 1988, Jane Grossman, Michael Grossman, and Robert Katz produced a number of publications on a subject created in 1967 by the latter two, called "non-Newtonian calculus." The geometric calculus and the bigeometric calculus are among the infinitely many non-Newtonian calculi that are multiplicative. (Infinitely many non-Newtonian calculi are not multiplicative.)
In 1972, Michael Grossman and Robert Katz completed their book "Non-Newtonian Calculus". It includes discussions of nine specific non-Newtonian calculi, the general theory of non-Newtonian calculus, and heuristic guides for application. Subsequently, with Jane Grossman, they wrote several other books/articles on non-Newtonian calculus, and on related matters such as "weighted calculus", "meta-calculus", and averages/means.
On page 82 of "Non-Newtonian Calculus", published in 1972, Michael Grossman and Robert Katz wrote:
General theory of non-Newtonian calculus.
Construction: an outline.
The construction of an arbitrary non-Newtonian calculus involves the real number system and an ordered pair * of arbitrary complete ordered fields.
Let R denote the set of all real numbers, and let "A" and "B" denote the respective realms of the two arbitrary complete ordered fields.
Assume that both "A" and "B" are subsets of R. (However, we are not assuming that the two arbitrary complete ordered fields are subfields of the real number system.) Consider an arbitrary function "f" with arguments in "A" and values in "B".
By using the natural operations, natural orderings, and natural topologies for "A" and "B", one can define the following (and other) concepts of the "*-calculus": the *-limit of "f" at an argument "a", "f" is *-continuous at "a", "f" is *-continuous on a closed interval, the *-derivative of "f" at "a", the *-average of a *-continuous function "f" on a closed interval, and the *-integral of a *-continuous function "f" on a closed interval.
Many, if not most, *-calculi are markedly different from the classical calculus, but the structure of each *-calculus is similar to that of the classical calculus. For example, each *-calculus has two Fundamental Theorems showing that the *-derivative and the *-integral are inversely related; and for each *-calculus, there is a special class of functions having a constant *-derivative. Furthermore, the classical calculus is one of the infinitely many *-calculi.
A "non-Newtonian calculus" is defined to be any *-calculus other than the classical calculus.
Relationships to classical calculus.
The *-derivative, *-average, and *-integral can be expressed in terms of their classical counterparts (and vice-versa). (However, as indicated in the Reception-section below, there are situations in which a specific non-Newtonian calculus may be more suitable than the classical calculus.)
Again, consider an arbitrary function f with arguments in A and values in B. Let α and β be the ordered-field isomorphisms from R onto A and B, respectively. Let α−1 and β−1 be their respective inverses.
Let D denote the classical derivative, and let D* denote the *-derivative. Finally, for each number t such that α(t) is in the domain of f, let F(t) = β−1(f(α(t))).
Theorem 1. For each number a in A, exists if and only if [DF(α−1(a)) exists, and if they do exist, then = β([DF(α−1(a))).
Theorem 2. Assume f is *-continuous on a closed interval (contained in A) from r to s, where r and s are in A. Then F is classically continuous on the closed interval (contained in R) from α−1(r) to α−1(s), and M* = β(M), where M* is the *-average of f from r to s, and M is the classical (i.e., arithmetic) average of F from α−1(r) to α−1(s).
Theorem 3. Assume f is *-continuous on a closed interval (contained in A) from r to s, where r and s are in A. Then S* = β(S), where S* is the *-integral of f from r to s, and S is the classical integral of F from α−1(r) to α−1(s).
Examples.
Let I be the identity function on R. Let j be the function on R such that j(x) = 1/x for each nonzero number x, and j(0) = 0. And let k be the function on R such that k(x) = √x for each nonnegative number x, and k(x) = -√(-x) for each negative number x.
Example 1. If α = I = β, then the *-calculus is the classical calculus.
Example 2. If α = I and β = exp, then the *-calculus is the geometric calculus.
Example 3. If α = exp = β, then the *-calculus is the bigeometric calculus.
Example 4. If α = exp and β = I, then the *-calculus is the so-called anageometric calculus.
Example 5. If α = I and β = j, then the *-calculus is the so-called harmonic calculus.
Example 6. If α = j = β, then the *-calculus is the so-called biharmonic calculus.
Example 7. If α = j and β = I, then the *-calculus is the so-called anaharmonic calculus.
Example 8. If α = I and β = k, then the *-calculus is the so-called quadratic calculus.
Example 9. If α = k = β, then the *-calculus is the so-called biquadratic calculus.
Example 10. If α = k and β = I, then the *-calculus is the so-called anaquadratic calculus.

Chris Pedersen (musician)

Chris Pedersen is an American-born musician, best known as the drummer of the groups Camper Van Beethoven and Monks of Doom. He currently resides in Australia.
Musical career.
Pedersen first played with Camper Van Beethoven members David Lowery and Chris Molla in the band Box O' Laffs in the early 1980s. When earlier Camper Van Beethoven drummer Anthony Guess (also a former drummer for Box O' Laffs) left Camper Van Beethoven following their debut album tour in fall of 1985, the group was temporarily without a drummer. Lowery and Molla filled in, also remixing Guess's prerecorded percussion work during much of the recording of their second album, 1986's "II & III". Pedersen joined as these recording sessions were finishing, and ended up playing on the track "We're A Bad Trip."
Pedersen also played on the albums "Camper Van Beethoven", "Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart" and "Key Lime Pie." In 1986, he also started the spin-off band Monks of Doom with Camper Van Beethoven members Molla, Greg Lisher, and Victor Krummenacher. In 1990, Camper Van Beethoven disbanded, and Pedersen continued playing in the Monks of Doom, now featuring David Immerglück as a replacement for Molla. The Monks of Doom disbanded in 1993 when Immerglück left the band to focus on full-time studio work. Pedersen moved to Australia in 1998, and the Monks of Doom reunited to play "final" shows before his move.
Although Pedersen still resides in Australia, he has spent time in the United States, playing with a reunited Camper Van Beethoven and Monks of Doom. Although Frank Funaro is now the full-time Camper drummer, Pedersen played most of the drum parts on their reunion album "New Roman Times" in 2004. He also played on the cover album "What's Left For Kicks?" made by the reunited Monks and occasionally flies to the United States for live performances and studio work with both bands.

Mitrovtsi

Mitrovtsi () is a village in northwestern Bulgaria, part of Chiprovtsi Municipality, Montana Province.
Mitrovtsi
Mitrovtsi is a village in North-Western Bulgaria. It is located in Chiprovtsi County, Montana Region. It is positioned beside the main road Sofia – Belogradchik – Vidin, between the villages of Beli Mel and Gorna Luka.
Administration 
Country: Bulgaria 
Region: Montana 
County: Chiprovtsi 
Mayor: Zahari Zamfirov
Geography
The village of Mitrovtsi is surrounded mainly with areas which are included in the “NATURA 2000” ecological network, consisting of relatively low mountains – below 1000 m high. Broadleaved woods cover the slopes of those mountains (oak, beech, hornbeam), with broad valleys in between them. The trees are covered with moss, many kinds of mushrooms can be found as well. Pinks, Orchids, Daisies, Peter’s Crosses and many other interesting plants grow here, some of them – endemits. The fauna is represented by Deer Stag, Rhino Beetle, other stag-beetles and rare insects. Many other amphibians, reptilians and rodents can be met as well. Game consists of wild boars, roes, foxes, rabbits and wolves are a trouble for the local farmers during some of the colder winters.
History
In the North-Western end of the village, right beside the “Krachtina” gulch, the “Gradishte” hill stands tall, where an ancient roman military camp has been established. No archeological research has been conducted on it.
The village becomes known from Turkish documents (it is mentioned for the first time in 1666 in the Rusi Staikov inventory – “National Library “Vasil Kolarov”. Notes for 1959”. T. 1 (7), Sofia, 1961, p. 324, Bervkovitsa’s Cadi) and notes belonging to European travelers like Mitrovuts and Mitrovitsa. After the liberation from Ottoman slavery it receives an administrative name - “Mitrovtsi”. 13 houses who are eligible for taxation by the Ottoman Empire are present in the 1666 registry books. 113 house and 679 population were registered in 1881, all Slavic.
The oldest hamlet in the village is called Kotromantsi (or Gmitrentsi). Those are probably the earliest settlers. Mitrovtsi is the first village after the Myzian and transit dialects which is present between Mitrovitsa and the neighboring Beli Mel. Benio Tzonev was the first one to notice this. The Ascension of Christ Church was built in 1871 replacing an older one. In the past the art specialist Asen Vasiliev saw 23 icons in this church, which was moved from the older temple, one of those icons dated in year 1843. The church was built by crafters from Slavinie, in Pirot region. An extremely valuable, interwoven with gold pall was preserved in the church. Today the pall is located in the Chiprovtsi museum. Some of the old icons were stolen or destroyed. Old frescos can be seen in the church as well.
During the communism in Bulgaria the church was turned into a cattle-shed and was repaired and renovated in 1995 – an initiative of Major Engineer Ognian Tasov (ret.), a grandson of Zahari Stefanov who was sentenced by the People’s Court, and was sanctified by his Right Reverend the Vidin Bishop Dometian. Today the church needs a new belfry.
The village participates actively in the fight for liberation against the Turks. In the middle of the 19th century (probably – in Vidin revolt) a band of freedom fighters was organized, led by the village’s “capetain” - the great grandfather of the famous Bulgarian chemist – professor Ivan Mladenov. Some of the villagers in the band died. The village is also an old center of Tannery craft, which was the family business of many citizens of Mitrovitsa. In 18th century leather crafted in Mitrovitsa has received Deeds on an exhibit held in Viena. The ethnographer Dimitar Marinov who visited the village in the end of the 19th century noted that mavhines were invented by the locals to process the animal hides into fine leather. Raw hides from the Mitrovitsa area used to be bought in bulk by different regions in Bulgaria.
After a long and difficult leather processing much of the production was exported in European countries with trains or steam boats along Denube river, through Oriahovo and Lom ports. During the first half of 20th century almost all the men in the village were abroad to work – South America or USA. There are documents describing workers returning from abroad to participate in the wars. Some of the citizens of Mitrovtsi have not return to Bulgaria but they earned good positions abroad. These circumstances contribute to the citizens of Mitrovtsi being one of the richest people in the region until the coming of communism. After 1944 many of the villagers emigrate in Western Europe and USA – in the cities of Denver, Detroit, Chicago, etc. In present days there are two companies in Mitrovtsi that provide work for three villages in the area: “Arsov-90” LTD – a carpentry company and “Integra” LTD – a furniture production plant.
Born in Mitrovtsi
Customs
Saint John’s Day is celebrated each year in the village of Mitrovtsi on January 20 (old) or – the closest Saturday to January 20. On these day all the people who carry the name Ivan (John) go out in front of their houses and treat everyone. Village’s annual fair is celebrated on Ascension of Christ Day, on the last Sunday of May. Moreover, Trifon Zarezan is celebrated in the village, as it is in the rest of the country, although the holiday was not typical and was introduced after the World War One. All the people and their guests gather and go to the vineyards. Each family has a vineyard and this is a tradition. Fires are lit and then the real celebration commences.
There is music and festivities all day long. The most important event is the “yellow vest” – it is given to the most drunkest person at the vineyards. A “King of the Vineyards” is also nominated – the person who has made the best wine. People from Mitrovitsi are famous with their sense of humor. Saint Ilia is a famous holiday as well. On this day everyone used to gather in Dren area where they were eating “prayer” – a soup from a sacrificed animal – a black ram. Now the place is destroyed by treasure-hunters. The ruins of “Mislovitsa” monastery are located close by. It is not researched and is only mentioned in “Spiritual Culture” (1973, number 2), but several years ago a group of archeologists has spoken with the locals and categorize the monastery as catholic.
Others
Illegal logging and the high-mobile logging trucks are the only enemies of the beautiful nature in the area. With a relatively good for a Bulgarian village infrastructure, Mitrovitsa is an excellent recreational place and a way to reach out a life of harmony from the past century.

Hermann, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg

Hermann Ernst Franz Bernhard, Fürst zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg (31 August 1832 – 9 March 1913) was the 6th Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and the second son of Ernst I, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and Princess Feodora of Leiningen (half-sister of Queen Victoria).
He succeeded to the title of 6th Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg ("Fürst zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg") on 21 April 1860, when his elder brother signed over his rights to the throne. He died 9 March 1913 in Langenburg, Kingdom of Württemberg, German Empire (present-day Baden-Württemberg, Germany).
Career.
He was a General in the Prussian Cavalry.
On 19 September 1899 he and his wife were in a saloon railway carriage at Perth Station. Lieutenant Colonel H A Yorke (RE retired), the Inspecting Officer of Railways who reported on the accident, said that they had had a miraculous escape from injury when another train collided with the stationery train in which they were standing.

The Family Guy 100th Episode Special

"The Family Guy 100th Episode Special" is a special episode from the sixth season of "Family Guy". The episode aired on November 4, 2007, and was followed by the actual 100th episode, "Stewie Kills Lois". It was hosted by Seth MacFarlane, who presented the funniest clips of all 99 previous episodes. This is also the only episode to credit Lacey Chabert, Meg's voice artist in the first production season, who was not credited in earlier episodes due to a contractual agreement.
Plot.
The show features MacFarlane interviewing people who did not approve of "Family Guy"'s content, with the running joke being they did not know they were talking to the creator of the show. MacFarlane also references the show's prior cancellation at the end of the special, when he toasts to the next 100 episodes and says, "Here's to the next 100... and hopefully we won't get cancelled for two and a half f--king years in the middle again!".

Flexity Berlin

The Flexity Berlin is a tram type constructed for the Berlin tramway network. It was developed by Bombardier Transportation during the late 2000s and is based on the "Incentro" family of 100% low-floor trams.
Overview.
The design is based upon earlier ADtranz Incentro models and like them, the Flexity Berlin is built from modules. The Berlin public transport operator Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) ordered four different prototypes for testing. The variants are one each of 30-metre and 40-metre lengths in double-ended, or single-ended design. The shorter versions use five modules and the longer versions are built with seven modules. Cab and door arrangement can be either bidirectional (two cab) or unidirectional (single cab) format depending upon the intended route. The first were rolled out during the InnoTrans 2008 railway trade fair. The appearance of the trams was especially designed for use in Berlin.
If the new Flexity tram tests are successful, then Bombardier's Hennigsdorf factory is scheduled to produce a further 206 units. The order would allow BVG to replace 452 high-floor ČKD Tatra KT4 trams. The Tatra trams being replaced are shorter and normally operated in pairs. 
In 2009 BVG placed an order for an initial 99 trams for delivery from May 2011. The actual roll-in will started on 5 September 2011. At the time of the initial order the BVG intented to order 33 more trams after 2017.
In June 2012 the BVG placed a second order for 39 trams - the last tram of the first contract arrived on 10. September 2012 and the first tram of the second contract arrived on 7. September 2012. The second contract included only long versions so that the amount of trams is enough to replace all of the old Tatra trams by 2017. The purchase is fully funded by the Bundesland Berlin at a size of 439.1 million Euro.
The nearby Strausberg Railway joined the delivery framework of the BVG Berlin Transport Company ordering 2 trams on 5. September 2011. The two short double-ended two-cab trams were delivered in February and March 2013 replacing its older trams (mostly Tatra KT8D5). The purchase is part of a 20-year contract with the county ensuring the financial basis. The contract for the two trams has a size of about 5½ million Euro.

Germanism (linguistics)

A Germanism is a loan word or other loan element borrowed from German for use in some other language.
Linguistic domains.
Technology and engineering have also provided Germanisms, as in the English "bremsstrahlung" (a form of electromagnetic radiation), or the French "schnorchel" (literally, "submarine snorkel," a type of air-intake device for submarine engines).
Examples in different languages.
Afrikaans.
In Afrikaans, a colloquial term for ethnic Germans is "aberjetze", from German "aber jetzt!" ("come on, now!"), possibly due to the frequent use of that phrase by German farmers or overseers in exhorting their workers.
Albanian.
Albanian has many loan words brought back from Germany by migrant workers. "Krikëll" for "beer mug," for example, is borrowed from the Austrian German term "Krügel". The German word "Schalter" has been borrowed in both its meanings ("(office) counter" and "(electric) switch") as Albanian "shalter". 
Arabic.
In the early 20th century, German film directors participated in the creation of the Egyptian cinema and usually concluded their work with the word "fertig" (done). Their local staff kept that word in the form "ferkish" and soon used it in other contexts.
In connection with the football World Cup, the German team is called "farik el Mannschaft", with the German "Mannschaft" meaning team – wherein "farik" is already the Arabic term for "team" and is supplemented by the article "el". When at the football World Cup of 2006 the German team lost to Italy, a saying went "el Mannschaft khessret!" ("The Mannschaft lost!")
In Sudan, the German word "Kollege" (colleague) acquired a very unusual importance. There it means straw, which was bound to a bundle for drying. The background to this important change is that colleagues are seen in the context of staying closely together.
Bassa.
In Bassa, a tribal language in Cameroon, the word for "train station" is "banop" from the German "Bahnhof", which recalls the Germans building the first railway in their former colony.
Belarusian.
In the heyday of the Hanseatic League (14th century), trade and administration in Belarus were strongly influenced by Germans. This show words such as "čynš" (чынш) from German "Zins" for "interest", "handal" (гандаль) from German "Handel" for "trade" and "štempel" (штэмпэль) from German "Stempel" for "rubber stamp". Other examples are "hiešeft" (гешэфт) from German "Geschäft" for "Business" and "falšavać" (фальшаваць) from German "fälschen" for counterfeiting.
Bosnian.
Bosnian has a number of loanwords from German: šlager (hit, from Schlager), šminka (make-up, from Schminke), šnajder (tailor, from Schneider), šunka (ham, from Schinken) etc. In the Bosnian language "rikverc" means the reverse gear of a vehicle that is best to be "rostfraj", stainless. The German equivalents are "rückwärts" and "rostfrei" respectively.
Bulgarian.
German words which were adopted into the Bulgarian language include бормашина, "drill", from German "Bohrmaschine", "ауспух", "exhaust pipe" from "Auspuff", "шибидах" from "Schiebedach" and in the skiing sport the term "Шус", which is the same as the English "schuss", was adopted from "Schussfahrt", a steep and fast ride downhill.
Even the German word "Anzug", "suit", is used in Bulgarian. However, it means "tracksuit" there.
Chinese.
One of the very few German loan words in Chinese is the word for storm drain covers, "Gullideckel" in German. The common Chinese term for "rain water hole", 雨水口, "yushuikou", is called "guli", 骨瀝, in the Qingdao form – contrary to the rest of China. The Chinese learned of storm drains for a city sewage in the German lease area of Jiaozhou. The approximately 40 German loan words that are in use in Qingdao still include the word 大嫚, "daman", for "Damen", "ladies" with 胶州大嫚 meaning "Jiaozhou-women".
Croatian.
In the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, typical Austrian German words such as paradajz (Paradeiser meaning "from paradise", for tomato, the verbatim translation "rajčica" is increasingly used), "špajza" (Speise, food), "knedli" (Knödel, dumplings), "Putar" ("butter", actually maslac), "ribizli" ("Ribisel", currants), "šnicla" (Schnitzel, pieces or chips, actually odrezak), "Fijaker" (Fiaker, Fiacre), "foranga" (Vorhänge, "curtains"), "herceg" (Herzog, "Duke"), "majstor" (Meister, "master") or "tišljar" (Tischler, "carpenter", actually postolar).
Similarly, names such as "pleh" (Blech, "tin"), "cajger" (Zeiger, "pointer"), "žaga" (Säge, "saw"), "šalter" (Schalter, "switch"), "šrafciger" (Schraubenzieher, "screwdriver", actually odvijač) or "curik" or "rikverc" (Zurück, "back" or rückwärts "backwards", for the reverse gear) are common in Croatia. Especially in the technical fields there are almost no phonetic differences with the German words, and most Croats understand these without good language skills in German.
Very rarely, the terms "špajscimer" (Speisezimmer, "dining room"), "badecimer" (Badezimmer, "bathroom"), "forcimer" (Vorzimmer, "hall"), "šlafcimer" (Schlafzimmer, "bedroom") and "cimer fraj" (Zimmer frei, "free room") are used in the colloquial language, as these newer loans mainly appear in advertising aimed for German tourists.
The washing machine is often referred to colloquially "vešmašina" (Waschmaschine, actually "perilica za rublje"). Somewhat odd is the use of the term "cušpajz" (Zuspeise, additional food) for a kind of vegetable stew.
Czech.
The Czech language borrowed some words from neighbouring dialects such as "hajzl" (from "Häusl" for a little house) for toilet. In "hřbitov" (cemetery), the German term "Friedhof" is hardly recognizable.
German import words were so frequently, that already Jan Hus 1412 vehemently opposed them. There were words like "hantuch" from German "Handtuch" for towel, "šorc" from "Schürze" for apron, "knedlík" from "Knödel", "hausknecht", German "Hausknecht", for servant and "forman" from "Fuhrmann" for waggoner. But Hus did not succeed. Knedlíky are still served, and in 1631, the school reformer Jan Amos Komenský didn't have a problem to translate the biblical term paradise with "lusthaus" (German "Lusthaus" "house of joy").
In the late 19th century, many Czech craftsmen worked in the German-speaking area of the Danube monarchy. The Czech language degrade into a servants language and took many loan words from this category: "ermloch" from German "Ärmelloch" for arm hole, "flikovat" from German "flicken" for darning and "piglovat" from "bügeln" for ironing.
In domestic disputes, German was a supplier of cuss words. Václav Havel used the word "glajchšaltace" (German "Gleichschaltung") to denounce the forced bringing-into-line, and called his counterpart Václav Klaus an "oberkašpar." (German vernacular "Oberkaspar" literally "master Kasperle", "master buffoon"). He, in turn, called a Havel a "lump" (German "Lump": approximately rascal, rapscallion). Sometimes opponents completely use German in order to ininhibit insult each other. Such an insult for example may be "Sie blöde Ente" "you stupid duck" (in German, this animal however is usually not used as a cuss...)
Other (sometimes used colloquially) Germanisms in Czech:
Danish.
In Danish, the German term "Hab und Gut", "Habseligkeiten", is used in the form of "habengut" to express one's possessions carried along. The word was introduced to Denmark by travelling journeymen who took all their possessions along with them.
"Bundesliga-hår" ("Bundesliga hair") is the Danish word for a mullet, because this type of haircut (as well as in Hungary) was regarded a characteristic of football Bundesliga players. Also the Italians saw this kind of connection and dubbed it "capelli alla tedesca" (German style haircut).
Dutch.
The Dutch language includes some well established words from German, for example "überhaupt" (at all, generally), "sowieso" (anyway), "Fingerspitzengefühl" (roughly "sensitivity", literally "finger tip feel").
The word "unheimisch" is used for something scary. (In Germany only an other form of this word is still used: "unheimlich") 
In sports, the words "Schwalbe" (in German the bird swallow, but also used for diving (football)), "Alleingang" (German for solo, also used in a figurative sense), "Ausputzer" (sweeper) and "die Mannschaft" (the team, for the German national soccer team) are used.
English.
One notable German word in the English language is "kindergarten". The first kindergarten outside the German area was founded in 1851 in London. Five years later, Margarethe Schurz opened the first kindergarten in America in Watertown, Wisconsin. The language in the first kindergarten was German, as they were thought to be for the children of German immigrants. In 1882, the number of kindergartens in the US was 348. Meanwhile, the majority of Americans are no longer aware of the German origin of the word. The kindergarten teacher was first called "kindergartner", and later "kindergarten teacher". "Kindergartner" is now the child who attends the kindergarten. The verb "to kindergarten" means using the kindergarten method. Often, however, only the first letter 'K' of the word "kindergarten" is used, so a "pre-K" is a child who is not old enough for kindergarten.
In English, the German "über" (hyper, over) is sometimes (often spelled "uber") used in compositions, as in ubergeek, to express extreme progression. In German on the other hand, the prefix "Über" is rarely used in the sense of superior, instead, "Super" is used, as in Superminister. The peculiar feature of the German language to build compound nouns contributes to proliferation of Germanisms and interesting neologisms.
Americans students often use the term "foosball" (German "Fußball") for the tabletop football, for which in Germany however the English term "kicker" is used.
For mobile phones, in German the pseudo-anglicism "Handy" is used, which is gradually establishing itself on the east coast of the United States as a designation for mobile phones, too. English slang dictionaries started to list "handy" in the meaning "mobile phone".
If somebody is sneezing, one may respond " bless you". Because many people don't want use a blessing phrase without religious context, instead the German term "gesundheit" is widely used. In German, "Gesundheit" means health, but is also used as response when someone sneezes.
The Concise Oxford English Dictionary lists the German word "verboten", defined as "forbidden by an authority". Weltschmerz, Schadenfreude, Brat, kaput, Weltanschauung.
Estonian.
There are long-lasting contacts between Estonian and German languages. Estonia was conquered in the Livonian crusade by German and Danish crusaders already in the 13th century. Since then, Estonia was settled by priests, merchants and craftsmen from Germany. As a result, the Estonian language has borrowed nearly a third of its vocabulary from Germanic languages, mainly from German. Examples include: "vein" (Wein, wine), "klaver" (Klavier, piano), "reis" (Reise, trip) and "kunst" (art). Modern loans from the Germans include "reisibüroo" (Reisebüro, travel agency) and "kleit" (Kleid, dress).
French.
In French, some Germanisms are due to the experiences in the Second World War, such as "witz" for a bad joke or threatening (in German, "Witz" is just joke) and "ersatz" for ersatz coffee (German "Ersatzkaffee", but more usually "Muckefuck", itself probably a Francesism from "mocca faux"). The word "lied", same meaning in English and French, is derived from the German "Lied" which translates as "song". (In German, the term "Lied" refers to any kind of song, however for contemporary music in German also often the anglicism "Song" is used.)
In French the word "vasistas" denotes a skylight window. The word probably originates from the Napoleonic Wars, when French soldiers looking at the German skylight ask "Was ist das?" (What is this?) It then became the name for this kind of windows.
"Schubladiser" is the French term for filing or procrastinating something. The noun is "schubladisation". "Schublade" is German for drawer, therefore these French terms can be literally translated as "drawering" and "drawerisation", resp.
In Swiss French, there are some terms derived from (Swiss) German such as "poutzer" instead of "nettoyer" (cleaning, in German "putzen") or "speck" instead of "lard" (bacon, in German "Speck").
Around the German-French border areas, inherently many words cross the language border, for example, in Lorraine: Instead of "ça éclabousse", "ça spritz" is used for "this sputters" – "spritzen" is "sputtering" in German. "Spritz" as a term for extruded biscuits ("Spritzgebäck" in German) is known everywhere in France.
Greek.
Modern Greek uses a few German loanwords for terms related to German or Austrian culture, such as "snitsel" ("σνίτσελ"; Schnitzel) and "froilain" ("φροϊλάιν", from Fräulein, "Miss", used only for young women from Germany or Austria). Some loan words were introduced by the "gastarbáiter" (" γκασταρμπάιτερ ", German Gastarbeiter), who have spent part of their life in Germany or Austria, such as lumben (λούμπεν ), meaning "riffraff", from German "Lump", "rogue".
Hebrew.
The modern Hebrew includes several Germanisms, some coming directly from German, and some via the Yiddish language. In the artisanal sector, some German phrases such as "stecker" (German "Stecker" for plug) and "dübel" (German "Dübel" for dowel), the latter pronounced due to the missing "ü" umlaut. 
The German word "Strudel" (שטרודל) in Hebrew is used for the character "@" in E-mail addresses, after the shape of the pastry.
The Hebrew word for siesta, is "schlafstunde" (German literally "hour to sleep"), although it is not clear whether the Yekkes started that habit in Israel or brought it from Germany.
The modern month names in Israel correspond to the German names: "Januar", "Februar", "März", etc. The only modification is "August" which is – different from the German – pronounced "Ogust", because the vocal connection "au" in Hebrew is unusual.
Hungarian.
The German vocabulary had already influenced the Hungarian language at the time of the marriage of the state's founder Stephen I of Hungary to princess Giselle of Bavaria in the year 996. An early example is the word "Herzog" ("Duke"). The Hungarian word "herceg" formed as a result of vowel harmony, the alignment of vowels in a word. This Hungarian word was later borrowed for the landscape name Hercegovina.
German clergy, farmers and craftsmen were linguistically influential, particularly in the 13th and 18th centuries, bringing their own terminology to Hungary. These include the job titles "bakter" ("Wächter", night watchman, train guard), "suszter" ("Schuster", cobbler) and "sintér" ("Schinder", a knacker) as well as the terms "kuncsaft" ("Kundschaft", customer) and "mester" ("Meister", master). In some professions, a large part of technical terms came via German, e.g. in the field of carpentry "lazur" ("Lasur", glaze), "firnisz" ("Firnis", lacquer), "lakk" ("Lack", varnish), "smirgli" ("Schmirgelpapier", sandpaper) and "colstok" ("Zollstock", foot rule).
Words were also loaned in the time of the monarchs from the House of Habsburg. This explains a number of German words that are mainly used in Austria. These include the words "krampusz" (Krampus, companion of Santa Claus), "partvis" ("Bartwisch", hand brooms), "nokedli" ("Nocken", dumpling), and "ribizli" ("Ribisel", gooseberry). "Eszcájg" derives from "Esszeug". Second-hand goods dealers were called "handlé" ("Händler", merchant). Further examples include "fasírt" (Austrian German "faschiert", minced meat) and "knődli" ("Knödel", hot dumplings).
Even a German sentence became a Hungarian word. "Vigéc", derived from the German greeting "Wie geht's?" (How are you?) is the Hungarian word for a door-to-door salesman. The word "spájz" ("Speis", Austrian German for "Speisekammer") is being used for the pantry.<br>
The Hungarian phrase "nem nagy vaszisztdasz" ("not a big what-is-it") is an informal way of belittling the complexity/importance of something (from German "was ist das?", "what is it?").
Italian.
Sometimes linguistic communities borrow the same term for a word from each other's language. This is the case for razzia – the Germans taken their word "Razzia" from the Italians (originally Arab غزوة ghazwa = "razzia"), the Italians use the term "blitz" for this, from the German word "Blitzkrieg". "Un lager" in Italian is not a beer like in English, but short for "Konzentrationslager".
German tourists's demand brought "il wurstel" to Italy ("Würstel" is a German dialect word for sausages), and even "il wurstel con krauti" (German "Kraut" short for "Sauerkraut").
Japanese.
In Japanese include some words with German origin, such as アルバイト ("arubaito") from the German "Arbeit" ("work", "job"); however, in Japan it is used to denote a minor job, e.g., a student's sideline.
Other words transferred into Japanese are related to climbing, like ヒュッテ ("hyutte") from German "Hütte" for mountain hut, ゲレンデ ("gerende") from German "Gelände" for terrain, アイゼン ("aizen") from German "Eisen" (short for "Steigeisen") for crampons, エーデルワイス ("ēderuwaisu") for Edelweiß, リュックサック ("ryukkusakku") from German "Rucksack" for backpack and probably also シュラフ ("shurafu") from German "Schlafsack" for sleeping bag. Also, the main Japanese mountain chain is called Japanese Alps.
During the Second World War, in Japanese weekly newsreels the military victories of the German Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel in Africa were frequently celebrated, thus establishing "rommel" as the Japanese term for victory or success. Even today, Japanese football mascots are called with this word.
Since the medical education initially was influenced by its German teachers, many German medical terms became part of the Japanese language. These include クランケ ("kuranke") from German "Kranke" as a term for the sick ones, カルテ ("karute") from German "Karte" (card) in the sense of a card to record the course of disease of a patient, ギプス ("gipusu") from German "Gips" for an orthopedic cast, アレルギー ("arerugī") from German "Allergie" for allergy, and ノイローゼ ("noirōze") from German "Neurose" for neurosis. Even the word オルガスムス ("orugasumusu") for orgasm originates from the German word "Orgasmus".
Of the typical German food items, the most commonly found in Japan are ザワークラウト ("sawākurauto", Sauerkraut) and the cake specialties シュトレン ("shutoren", Stollen) and バウムクーヘン ("baumukūhen", Baumkuchen).
See also gairaigo.
Kirundi.
In Kirundi, the language of the African Great Lakes country Burundi, the word for German people (the former colonial rulers) is "dagi". That is derived from the German salutation "Tag", short for "Guten Tag" (literally "wish you a good day").
Korean.
In order to remove the last relics of the occupation during the Second World War, in South Korea most Japanese loan words are removed from the vocabulary. This does not include the word 아르바이트 ("areubaiteu") with is still used both in the Korean and Japanese language. The Japanese アルバイト ("arubaito") is derived from the German word "Arbeit" (work, job), but here denotes a student's sideline.
Although a majority of internationalisms (largely Latin or Greek-based) are borrowed from English, a considerable minority of internationalisms are borrowed from German, usually via Japanese, in the field of chemistry, medicine, philosophy, etc., such as 요오드 ("yoodeu" < Iod), 망간 ("manggan" < Mangan), 부탄 ("butan" < Butan), 알레르기 ("allereugi" < Allergie), 히스테리 ("hiseuteri" < Hysterie), 이데올로기 ("ideollogi" < Ideologie), 테마 ("Tema" < Thema), etc. In addition, there are also loanwords of native German origin, such as 코펠 ("kopel" (portable cooker), a corrupted form of Kocher, via Japanese コッヘル "kohheru"), and hybrids like 메스실린더 ("meseusillindeo" <German "Mess-" (measuring) + English "cylinder"; "Messzylinder" in German).
Macedonian.
In Macedonian, the denotation of "witz" is виц, similar as in French.
Norwegian.
The German word "Vorspiel" translates to "prelude", also with sexual connotation, and "Nachspiel" translates to aftermath. In contrast, in Norwegian the words "vorspiel" and "nachspiel" stand for the consumption of alcoholic beverages before or after a visit of bars or discothèques (German "vorglühen", a quite recent neologism reflecting the use of Glühwein, and "Absacker").
Polish.
The German language also influenced Polish and other Slavic languages, for example "kajuta" from German "Kajüte" for (ship) cabin, "sztorm" from German "Sturm" for storm, "burmistrz" from German "Bürgermeister" for mayor, "szynka" from German "Schinken" for ham, or "handel" from German "Handel" for trade".
In Polish, "szlafmyca" from German "Schlafmütze" means night cap, but – as in German – also used in a figurative sense as sleepyhead. "Szlafrok" from German "Schlafrock" is a dressing-gown.
A Polish craftsman uses a "śruba" (screw, from German "Schraube") and "klajster" (paste/glue from German "Kleister"). If he does not know the name of his tool, he may ask for a "wihajster" (thingamabob, from German "Wie heißt er?", literally "how is it called?"). And will receive the requested thing:
There is also the word "fajrant" (leisure-time, from German "Feierabend"). In a carousal, he can drink to someone "bruderszaft" (from German "Bruderschaft", fraternity) and disband with a "rausz" (from German "Rausch", inebriation).
Portuguese.
The Portuguese incorporates German words such as "diesel" and "kitsch."
In Brazilian Portuguese, German immigrants brought some German words. The word "blitz" describes a traffic control (German "Blitz" is flash, also colloquial for traffic control due to the flash light.) Also known are "malzbier", "quark" and "chopp", the latter from "Schoppen" (German for a pint, in Brazilian Portuguese however denoting a draught beer). Also, in Brazil the German "Streuselkuchen" is a cuca, spread on a bread in the Riograndian Hunsrückian became, via the German "schmier" (grease), "chimia". In the areas of German immigraints, also "oktoberfest" and "kerb" (Hunsrückian for kermesse) are celebrated. The word "chipa" is derived from the German "Schippe" (shovel).
Romanian.
In Romanian, German loans are especially found in names for craft items: "bormaşină" (drill, in German "Bohrmaschine"), "ştecher" (plug, "Stecker"), "şurub" (screw, "Schrube"), "şubler" (vernier caliper, "Schublehre"), "şnur" (electric cord, German "Schnur" is cord in general), but there are also: 
Russian.
After Tsar Peter the Great returned from Western Europe in the year 1698, the loan words were no longer taken from Greek and Polish. With Peter, transfers from Polish were replaced by transfers from Western languages. For the drastic reforms in the military and administration, economic and administrative experts were recruited from Germany. 1716 Peter ordered that the administrative writers learn German:
In some sectors of handicraft, the Germans were the majority; towards the end of the 18th Century, thirty German but only three Russian watchmakers worked in St. Petersburg .
The Russian has taken many words from the military sector from German, for example "Schlagbaum" "шлагбаум" (turnpike) and "Marschroute" "маршрут" (line of approach), and also expressions like
"Rucksack" "рюкзак" (backpack), "Massstab" "масштаб" (scale), "Strafe" "штраф" (in German punishment, in Russian in the meaning fine), and "Zifferblatt" "циферблат" (clock face).
Mikhail Lomonosov, who studied in Marburg and Freiberg, is regarded as founder of the Russian mining science, mineralogy and geology. In his writings about mining and metallurgy, he uses German words, the names of metals and minerals "Wismut" "Висмут" (bismuth), "Wolfram" "Вольфрам" (tungsten), "Gneis" "Гнейс" (gneiss, "Kwarz" (in German spelled Quarz) "Кварц" (quartz), "Potasch" (in German Pottasche) "Поташ" (potash), "Zink" "Цинк" (zinc), "Schpaty" (German Spat) "шпаты" (feldspar), and the expression "schteiger" (German "Steiger") (foreman of miners). Also the terms "geolog" (German Geologe) (geologist), "gletscher" (glacier) "metallurgia" (German "Metallurgie") ("metallurgy"), "nikel" (in German Nickel), "schichta" (German "Schicht" (layer), used both for ore layer and layer in a blast furnace), and "schlif" (German Schliff) (the grinding or cutting of a stone) fall into this category.
Interestingly are terms from chess as "Zugzwang" "цугцванг", "Zeitnot" "цейтнот", "Endspiel" "эндшпиль" (endgame), Mittelspiel" "мительшпиль" (middlegame), "Grossmeister" "(гроссмейстер) (grandmaster).
Modern expressions are "Strichcode" "штрихкод" (barcode), "Butterbrot" "бутерброд", and even "Brandmauer", for which in German the English expression is used.
"Schram" "Шрам" is a scar and originates from the German word "Schramme" (scratch, scar). A "schtolnja" "штольня" (German "Stollen") is an adit. A "schpagat" "шпагат" (German spelling Spagat) is a Split (gymnastics), "schpinat" "шпинат" (German spelling Spinat) spinach and a "schpion" "шпион" (German spelling Spion) a spy.
Even the hockey term for puck, "schajba" "шайба", originates from German "Scheibe", denoting a Washer. Interestingly is also the word "schlang" "шланг" for garden hose, derived from the German word for a snake, "Schlange". The word "schtepsel" "штепсель" originates from the German word "Stöpsel" (plug). Buzhgalter (Busthalter), Schachmati (Schach), (K)artoffel.

An exhibition in Vienna about Gastarbeiter in Austria has the Serbian title "gastarbajteri". A particularly avid student is called "štreber" (German "Streber" is striver). "Schlag" for cream is derived from the Austrian short form for "Schlagobers".
The Serbian word for tomatoes, "Парадајз" "(paradajs)", is influenced from the Austrian "Paradeiser".
Slovak.
In the 19th century, Slovak artisans in Austria-Hungary borrowed words from handicraft: "plech" (German "Blech" for plate), "drôt" ("Draht", wire), "schuble" ("Schnublade", drawer), "schroubovák" ("Schraubenzieher", screwdriver), and "virhank" ("Vorhang", curtain).
Swedish.
Swedes use the German word "aber" (but) in the sense of "obstacle" or "objection". A nouveau riche is called "Gulaschbaron" (colloquialism in German language, literally "goulash baron").
For undercover investigative journalism in the style of Günter Wallraff the verb "wallraffa" is used, which is even part of the Swedish Academy's dictionary.
Slovene.
Slovene Germanisms are primarily evident in the syntax, lexicon, semantics, and phraseology of the language. There are few Germanisms in Slovene phonology and morphology. Many Slovene lexical Germanisms come from Austrian German.
Spanish.
The Spanish language of some South American countries incorporates Germanisms introduced by German immigrants, for example, in Chile "kuchen" (cake) and "Frankfurter" in Uruguay. The latter, however, sometimes is used for a hot dog – not as in German for the sausage only. In Argentine, the usage of the name "Pancho" is interesting: it's a popular nickname for "Francisco" or "Franco", and therefore also used for "Frank"furter sausages. The Chileans pronounce "kuchen" as in German with the ach-Laut, not "kutshen", as a Spanish pronunciation would be.
In Chile, the German word "suche" (searching) (pronounced in Chile "sutsche" instead with the German ach-Laut) is used for house staff (gardeners, errand boys). After the German immigrants came to a certain prosperity, they posted job advertisements for local forces, which often started with the German verb "suche" in a large-size font.
In Mexico, "kermes", from the German word "Kirmes" (funfair, kermesse), is used for a charitable street party.
Swahili.
The dominant lingua franca in the African Great Lakes region, Swahili, has borrowed many words from Arabic and English. Borrowed from the German "Schule", however, is the word "shule" for school.
Tok Pisin.
Even the Kreol Tok Pisin in the former German colony Papua-New Guinea has words borrowed from German language. These include "balaistift" from German "Bleistift" for "pencil", however today the English term is preferred. "Raus" (literally in German "get out!" means "Go!" or "From the way". Derived from "raus" is "rausim" meaning "empty", "dismissed away."
A reminder of the missionary by German Catholic lay brothers are the words "bruda" from German "Bruder" for brother and "prista" from German "Priester" for priests. A relic of German colonialists' behaviour are invectives such as "rinfi" from German "Rindvieh", literally cattle, but used also as invective for a silly person, and "saise" from German "Scheiße", shit.
Turkish.
The Turkish word "fertik" as signal for a railway to be ready to depart originates from the Baghdad Railway which was initially operated by German personnel. The Germans command "fertig" (ready) became the Turkish "fertik" and firstly also denoted the train conductor. Nevertheless, this word was only used in slang and has been abandoned after the 50s.
Another Germanism is "Otoban" from German "Autobahn" for highway.
Impact on Grammar.
The Modern Hebrew "iton" for newspaper is modeled after the German word "Zeitung", using "et" for "time" ("Zeit" in German).
Derivations of German words.
Germanisms in foreign languages may have gone through a change of meaning, appearing as false friend to the learner's eye. For instance, in Russian language, a галстук "galstuk" is not a scarf (German literally: ""Halstuch""), but a tie; nor would a парикмахер "parikmacher" (German literally: ""Perückenmacher"") be a "wig-maker", but actually denote a hairdresser.
Likewise, in Japanese, a "messer" is not a knife, but a scalpel. Two more examples would be Japanese アルバイト (transliterated to "arubaito", derived from German: "Arbeit" ["work"] and abbreviated to "baito") and リュックサック (transliterated to "ryukkusakku"; derived from German "Rucksack"; abbreviated to リュック ["ryukku"]).

St Vincent's Church, Sheffield

St Vincent’s Church is a disused (since 1998) Roman Catholic church situated on Solly Street at its junction with Hollis Croft in the centre of the City of Sheffield, South Yorkshire.
History.
Irish emigration to Sheffield.
As a result of the Irish Potato Famine between the years of 1845 and 1849 many emigrants left Ireland to try to find a better life in England. The developing cutlery and tool industries of Sheffield attracted many of these Irish emigrants and they settled in "The Crofts" area of the town. The Crofts was centred on Solly Street (then called Pea Croft) and at that time was the centre of the Sheffield steel, cutlery and filemaking industries. It was an area of working class tenements and back to back housing interspersed with iron and steel works and small workshops making cutlery and hand tools.
Founding of St Vincent’s.
The majority of the Irish emigrants in The Crofts were Roman Catholics and worshipped at the newly opened St Marie’s church in Norfolk Row, the only Catholic church in Sheffield in the early 1850s. Father Edmund Scully of St Marie’s pledged to build a school-chapel for The Crofts area and on Good Friday 1851 a plot of ground was purchased in the area for £700. Matthew Ellison Hadfield designed the chapel-school which was completed in July 1853 at a cost of £1,850. 
Chapel becomes a church.
The chapel was greatly expanded in 1856 by George Goldie, a partner of Hadfield’s, with the addition of a nave and a chancel at a cost of £3,100 and was officially recognised as a church although it had no tower or spire. Further building work costing £650 took place in 1870 when a church tower was built up to a height of 40 feet which incorporated the south porch and an entrance from White Croft. The tower was raised up to its present day height of 93 feet in 1911 when a donation of £1,400 by Mr. Philip Wake enabled it to be completed in a design in the Norman style based on a typical church in Normandy. The architect of the new tower was Charles Hadfield and it was formally blessed and opened by Michael Logue Primate of All Ireland on 28 October 1911.
Inter war years.
1920 saw the division of St Vincent’s parish with the creation of the Sacred Heart parish in the Hillsborough area of the city. The area around the church was still mostly slum housing with some crime, one of the gangs involved in the Sheffield Gang Wars of the mid 1920s was of Irish descent with most of its members from the St Vincent’s parish. The Great Depression in the United Kingdom caused great hardship in the parish, it eventually resulted in a programme of slum clearances which began in 1929. Many acres of old properties were demolished in the parish and the residents moved to more spacious housing in the suburbs. The slum clearances continued up to 1938 when they were suspended because of the imminence of war.
World War II.
The first Sheffield Blitz raid by German bombers on the night of 12/13 December 1940 resulted in the destruction of the original 1853 chapel when a parachute mine landed on the roof. The original girls school was also destroyed and every window in the church was blown out destroying some valuable stained glass windows. The newer part of the church from 1911 escaped serious damage.
Post war and present day.
Vigorous fund raising enabled much re-building to be done on the damaged church in the 1950s, this included a new chapel, replacement roofs and a new entrance porch, organ loft and choir gallery.
Due to the war damage and continuing slum clearances in the post war St Vincent’s area, the church lost much of its congregation as the district was rebuilt as a business area. In 1998 it closed as a place of worship and is in need of some renovation with much of the land round the church used for car parking. The interior of the church is currently used for storing furniture for the Vincent's charity which recycles old furniture and redistributes it to the city's poorer and more vulnerable people. The church is now within the St Vincent's Quarter of Sheffield which is undergoing slow rejuvenation. Sheffield City Council are looking at new ways that the St Vincent’s group of buildings can be used in conjunction with the owners and the local community, and at the end of 2004 announced the St Vincent’s Action Plan which includes:

Joshua Cobb

Joshua Cobb (born 17 August 1990 in Leicester) is an English cricket player. He currently plays for Leicestershire County Cricket Club. He is a top order batsmen and occasional off-spinner. He was man of the match in the 2011 Friends Life t20 Final.
Joshua is a very capable batsman, and this was shown when he scored a brilliant double century for the England Under 19s, and has a very very bright future ahead of him as he progresses in the game to become a good all round cricketer. He attended Oakham School as a child where he was a key member of there 1st team, averaging over 50 with the bat in his final season.
Joshua made his first team debut in 2007, aged just 17, but gained a regular place in 2008 with a series of impressive scores. This included 148 not out against Middlesex County Cricket Club at Lord's Cricket Ground, an innings which made him Leicestershire's youngest ever centurion. He is also a capable off spin bowler. Joshua had started his 2011 county campaign is average style, but he recently came back to his usual self, as he scored 61 runs off 62 balls in a Clydesdale Bank 40 match at Grace Road against Scotland. He came to prominence at the 2011 Friends Life t20 Final against Somerset, where he won the man of the match award after scoring a crucial quick fire 18 and then taking a career best 4–22 to help restrict Somerset to 127–9 giving the Foxes the Cup by a total of 18 runs.
In July 2012, Cobb was named captain of Leicestershire's limited overs side, succeeding Matthew Hoggard. In 2013 he was named vice-captain to Ramnaresh Sarwan for Leicester's County Championship campaign.
In 2013 Joshua signed for the Dhaka Gladiators in the Bangladesh Premier League Twenty 20 tournament.
Personal life.
Cobb follows in the footsteps of his father, Russell Cobb, who was also a Leicestershire batsmen (and currently works as Head Coach at Loughborough University).
On 1 September 2013, Cobb was arrested with Ned Eckersley for being drunk and disorderly in Leicester city centre.
2012 season.
Cobb has begun the 2012 season well – and he is beginning to show his true potential in the longer form of the game. While being an attacking batsman, he has been able to work on decision making and has played the correct shots a lot of the time. This improvement along with some more good performances may hold Cobb in good stead for a future selection for the England Lions, which the former Leicestershire player James Taylor leads.
Career Best Performances.

Eclipse-class sloop

The "Eclipse" class was a class of seven 6-gun wooden screw sloops built for the Royal Navy between 1867 and 1870. They were re-armed and re-classified as 12-gun corvettes in 1876. Two further vessels were proposed but never ordered.
Design.
A development of the "Amazon" class, they were designed by Edward Reed, the Royal Navy's Director of Naval Construction. The hull was of wooden construction, but with iron cross-beams, and a ram bow was fitted.
Propulsion.
Propulsion was provided by a two-cylinder horizontal steam engine driving a single screw. "Spartan", "Sirius" and "Tenedos" had compound steam engines, and the remainder of the class had single-expansion steam engines.
Sail plan.
All the ships of the class were built with a ship rig, but this was replaced with a barque rig.
Armament.
The "Eclipse" class was designed with two 7-inch (6½-ton) muzzle loading rifled guns mounted in traversing slides and four 64-pounder muzzle loading rifled guns. They were re-classified as corvettes in 1876, carrying a homogenous armament of twelve 64-pounder muzzle loading rifled guns.

Trivial Graph Format

Trivial Graph Format (TGF) is a simple text-based file format for describing graphs. It consists of a list of node definitions, which map node IDs to labels, followed by a list of edges, which specify node pairs and an optional edge label. Node IDs can be arbitrary identifiers, whereas labels for both nodes and edges are plain strings.
The graph may be interpreted as a directed or undirected graph. For directed graphs, to specify the concept of bidirectionality in an edge, one may either specify two edges (forward and back), or differentiate the edge by means of a label. For more powerful specification of graphs, see the other graph file formats below.
Example.
A simple graph with 2 nodes and 1 edge might look like this:
The # sign marks the end of the node list and the start of the edge list.
Ease of use.
TGF is useful for easily importing arbitrary data into a graph manipulation tool such as yEd. Because of the simplicity of the format, it is straightforward to use small programs or scripts to convert domain-specific data to this general format. For example, given a Makefile like this:
It is possible to use a simple script, such as the following Python program, to turn the Makefile dependencies into TGF output:
This will produce a TGF graph which can then be visualized and analyzed using a graph manipulation tool. The above content yields the following graph:

William McKeag

William McKeag (29 June 1897 – 4 October 1972) was a British politician, soldier and solicitor. His political affiliations changed over the years from Liberal to National Liberal, back to Liberal and finally to Conservative but he never wavered from a fierce loyalty to his native North East of England and was described in his obituary in "The Times" newspaper as one of the North East’s leading figures, a keen publicist for the area and for Tyneside in particular.
Family and education.
William McKeag was born in County Durham, the son of William McKeag of Carrville near Belmont. In 1922 he married Marie Elizabeth the daughter of William Corn Crow of Newcastle upon Tyne. They had two sons and a daughter. McKeag was educated at Belmont School, at Johnston’s School in Durham and privately.
War Service.
McKeag was 17 years old at the outbreak of the Great War. He joined the army and served six years in France, Italy, Turkey and Russia. He fought with the White Russian commanders Anton Ivanovich Denikin and Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel and during his time in Russia he became the youngest First-Class Warrant Officer in the British Army. During his service he was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal as well as two Russian decorations, the Order of Saint Stanislaus and the Order of Saint Anne. 
During the Second World War McKeag attained the rank of Major in the infantry and was Deputy Assistant Adjutant General.
Career.
McKeag qualified as a solicitor becoming a partner in firm of Molineux McKeag and Cooper, which had offices in Newcastle upon Tyne and Durham. He later became the director of various companies.
Politics, 1924–35.
At the 1924 general election, McKeag, who had reputation for being a witty and able debater was the Liberal candidate for Durham but lost to Labour candidate Joshua Ritson who had held the seat since 1922. He fought Durham again in 1929 but was again beaten by Ritson. By the time of the 1931 general election however, the national mood was swinging against Labour. The crisis in the economy over the summer of 1931 which brought about the National Government of prime minister Ramsay MacDonald meant that McKeag fought the general election in October as a Liberal in support of the National Government, enabling him to take advantage of the public support for the coalition and win the seat by the narrow majority of 270 votes. When the Liberal Party led by Sir Herbert Samuel withdrew from the coalition in November 1933, McKeag refused to cross the floor into opposition with Samuel. He then associated himself with the Liberal National group in Parliament led by Sir John Simon at least to allow him to be the nominated National candidate at the 1935 general election, which he fought under the description Liberal National in a straight fight with the former Labour MP Joshua Ritson. Labour were confident of a political revival in 1935, attacking the government on domestic policy and the armaments programme insisting that a vote for the National government meant a vote for war. Durham went solidly Labour with the party winning every seat in the County, including the Seaham constituency of Ramsay MacDonald.
Newcastle politics.
McKeag resumed political activity at a local level after losing his Parliamentary seat. He resumed his status as a Liberal without prefix or suffix and was elected to Newcastle City Council in 1936. He remained a member of the Council for 25 years, during which time he was raised to the Aldermanic Bench, Deputy Mayor and was Mayor of the City twice, in 1951–52 and in 1953–54. In 1966, he was declared an Honorary Freeman of Newcastle. 
McKeag still retained ambitions to return to Parliament as a Liberal but during the Second World War there was a truce between the main political parties which ensured that they did not oppose each other when by-elections occurred. In 1940 however the seat of Newcastle upon Tyne North became vacant on the retirement of Sir Nicholas Grattan-Doyle, the sitting Conservative MP. While the Liberals would not officially oppose the Conservative candidate, Sir Nicholas’ son Second Lieutenant Howard Grattan-Doyle, McKeag was talked of as a possible Independent candidate for the by-election. However, the seat was successfully contested by an Independent Unionist, Cuthbert Headlam. In the event, McKeag did not stand, perhaps because like a large number of electors he found it distasteful to fight an election when the British Expeditionary Force was struggling to get home from the beaches of Dunkirk, perhaps because he did not wish his political career to interfere with his own war service. 
McKeag retained his connection with the Liberal Party, holding the positions of President of Tynemouth Liberal Association and Vice –President of Newcastle Liberal Club and he tried again to get back to Parliament as a Liberal in Newcastle North at the 1945 general election and in 1950 at Newcastle upon Tyne East but after this he seems to have become disillusioned with the prospects of the party.
Changing political allegiances.
By the mid-1950s, McKeag’s political label on Newcastle City Council was described as Progressive rather than Liberal and he was some time president of the Progressive Party in Newcastle. It was clear he had moved towards the Conservatives however, perhaps retaining links from his days as a Liberal National because in 1957 McKeag was nominated by the old disaffiliated Newcastle North Conservative Association as a candidate in the by-election caused by the elevation to the peerage of Gwilym Lloyd-George in opposition to the official Conservative. The old association was disaffiliated in 1951 when the new one was formed to accommodate Lloyd-George’s becoming the local MP. Mc Keag agreed to accept the nomination. The official Conservatives adopted a young Morpeth farmer, R W Elliott and Labour chose T L MacDonald a Carlisle printer. In the event the unofficial Conservatives chose not to contest the election which Elliott won comfortably with a majority of more than 6,000 votes.
Other public service.
McKeag held a long list of public offices as a result of his professional and political associations with Newcastle, County Durham and the North East of England. He was President of the Newcastle upon Tyne Law Students Association, a member of Newcastle upon Tyne Law Society Council, Under Sheriff of Newcastle upon Tyne; a Governor of Royal Victoria Infirmary; a Governor of Newcastle Royal Grammar School; Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee of Newcastle Corporation; a Member of Tyneside Industrial Development Board; a member of the Committee of the Institute of Directors of Newcastle upon Tyne; a member of the Tyne Improvement Commission, an organisation which held property along the River Tyne. He also supported many local associations and charities in the North East. He also held the position of Consul for the Republic of Iceland and was a Commander of the Order of the Falcon an Icelandic award for Icelanders and foreigners for achievements in Iceland or internationally.
McKeag was also a Director of Newcastle United Football Club for 28 years and was for a time its Chairman. His son Gordon McKeag was also a Chairman of the Club from 1988–1990.
Death.
McKeag died aged 75 years on 4 October 1972 at Whitley Bay.

Saint Mary's Academy - Dominica (abbreviated as SMA) is an all-boy Catholic secondary school in Roseau, Dominica. SMA offers First Form through Fifth Form, which is generally followed by two years of non-compulsory further education – often at a Sixth Form College.
History.
The founder of the school is Blessed Edmund Rice. Blessed Edmund Rice was given the Grace to respond to the call of Jesus by identifying with Christ in the poor. His example evoked a deep awareness of God's loving presence in all with whom he came in contact. He awakened within them consciousness of their dignity as children of God. He invited his followers to share his Gospel insight, and empowered them to reach out to the needy, especially the materially poor. The life of blessed Edmund Rice - businessman, husband, father, widower, religious brother, teacher and founder - challenges all involved in Christian Brother Education to live and teach Gospel values in today's world. His charisma inspired the essential elements of a Christian Brother Education.
Mission statement.
(For the St. Mary's Academy and all other Catholic Schools in Dominica).
Uniform.
The Academy's uniform consists of a white shirt jack with the school's crest pinned to the breast pocket however the student desires. Brown khaki pants are worn, except for special occasions, like church masses, where black pants are worn.
Student Council.
At the beginning of every school year that commences in September, student councils are chosen by the pupils. The party normally consists of a President, a Vice-President, a public relations officer (chief communications officer), treasurer, and a secretary.
Buildings.
The S.M.A. compound consists of two main buildings, the Old Wing, and the New Wing (Brother Germain Wing). The Principal's office is located on the bottom floor of the Old Wing, and there are two staff rooms, one on the Old Wing, and another on the New Wing.

Manchester Oldham Road railway station

Manchester Oldham Road was a railway station built on the Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&LR) in Miles Platting, Greater Manchester. Built in 1839 and opened on 3 July, it was the Manchester terminus for the railway.
History.
The station was built in 1839 on the north side of Oldham Road, and the east side of Lees Street. The line reached the station by a viaduct, 30 feet above the surrounding streets. A 'flight of spacious stairs' was used by passengers to reach the 'very commodious' station building. M&LR passenger trains from and to Yorkshire served the station from its opening on 3 July.
In 1839, both the M&LR and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway realised that their respective stations were too far from the city centre. Despite the conflicting aspirations of the two companies, negotiations between the two resulted in agreement to build a new station at the central location of Hunt's Bank, with the M&LR to have control. The M&LRs extension of the line to the newly completed Manchester Victoria at Hunts Bank opened on 1 January 1844 and the original M&LR station closed for passenger use on the same date. An Act of Parliament, receiving royal assent had been obtained on 1 July 1839, enabling construction of this extension.
Once the M&LRs new extension had been opened, Oldham Road station was converted from passenger use to the receipt, unloading, storing and despatch of goods. From 1844, goods trains operated along what was now a short branch line (72-chains in length) from Oldham Road Junction near Miles Platting station. Waggons of or more were raised and lowered from the goods yard at street level below by a double hoist. The business offices (including the Superintendent's office) of the railway remained at the station. 
The goods depot continued to grow in size throughout the nineteenth century under the ownership of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and was completely rebuilt in 1916. In its final form it had a number of 'sheds', which were called the Fruit Shed, Provision Shed, Delivery Shed, Fish Shed, Cloth Shed, Grain Shed, Potato Shed and the Shipping Shed, indicating the diversity of traffic handled there. British Railways London Midland Region continued to handle sundries traffic at Oldham Road for some years after the nationalisation of 1948.
Current status.
The area is very different from what it once was. The station and line no longer exist, although part of the viaduct which led to it is still visible from the railway line from Victoria to Miles Platting and from the eastern end of New Allen Street. Most of the old station and sidings have since been replaced by a large Royal Mail sorting depot.

Moons of Haumea

The outer Solar System dwarf planet Haumea has two known moons, Hiiaka and Namaka, named after Hawaiian goddesses. These small moons were discovered in 2005, from observations of Haumea made at the large telescopes of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.
Haumea's moons are unusual in a number of ways. They are thought to be part of its extended collisional family, which formed billions of years ago from icy debris after a large impact disrupted Haumea's ice mantle. Hiiaka, the larger, outermost moon, has large amounts of pure water ice on its surface, a feature rare among Kuiper belt objects. Namaka, about one tenth the mass, has an orbit with surprising dynamics: it is unusually eccentric and appears to be greatly influenced by the larger satellite.
Discovery and naming.
Two small satellites were discovered around Haumea (which was at that time still designated 2003 EL61) through observations using the W.M. Keck Observatory by a Caltech team in 2005.
The outer and larger of the two satellites was discovered January 26, 2005, and formally designated S/2005 (2003 EL61) 1, though nicknamed "Rudolph" by the Caltech team. The smaller, inner satellite of Haumea was discovered on June 30, 2005, formally termed S/2005 (2003 EL61) 2, and nicknamed "Blitzen". On September 7, 2006, both satellites were numbered and admitted into the official minor planet catalogue as (136108) 2003 EL61 I and II, respectively.
The permanent names of these moons were announced, together with that of 2003 EL61, by the International Astronomical Union on September 17, 2008: (136108) Haumea I Hiʻiaka and (136108) Haumea II Namaka. Each moon was named after a daughter of Haumea, the Hawaiian goddess of fertility and childbirth. Hiiaka is the goddess of dance and patroness of the Big Island of Hawaii, where the Mauna Kea Observatory is located. Nāmaka is the goddess of water and the sea; she cooled her sister Pele's lava as it flowed into the sea, turning it into new land.
In her legend, Haumea's many children came from different parts of her body. The dwarf planet Haumea appears to be almost entirely made of rock, with only a superficial layer of ice; most of the original icy mantle is thought to have been blasted off by the impact that spun Haumea into its current high speed of rotation, where the material formed into the small Kuiper belt objects in Haumea's collisional family. There could therefore be additional outer moons, smaller than Namaka, that have not yet been detected. However, HST observations have confirmed that no other moons brighter than 0.25% of the brightness of Haumea exist within the closest tenth of the distance (0.1% of the volume) where they could be held by Haumea's gravitational influence (its Hill sphere). This makes it unlikely that any more exist.
Surface properties.
Hiʻiaka is the outer and, at roughly 350 km in diameter, the larger and brighter of the two moons. Strong absorption features observed at 1.5, 1.65 and 2 µm in its infrared spectrum are consistent with nearly pure crystalline water ice covering much of its surface.
The unusual spectrum, and its similarity to absorption lines in the spectrum of Haumea, led Brown and colleagues to conclude that it was unlikely that the system of moons was formed by the gravitational capture of passing Kuiper belt objects into orbit around the dwarf planet: instead, the Haumean moons must be fragments of Haumea itself.
The sizes of both moons are calculated with the assumption that they have the same infrared albedo as Haumea, which is reasonable as their spectra show them to have the same surface composition. Haumea's albedo has been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope: from ground-based telescopes, the moons are too small and close to Haumea to be seen independently. Based on this common albedo, the inner moon, Namaka, which is a tenth the mass of Hiiaka, would be about 170 km in diameter.
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has adequate angular resolution to separate the light from the moons from that of Haumea. Photometry of the Haumea triple system with HST's NICMOS camera has confirmed that the spectral line at 1.6 µm that indicates the presence of water ice is at least as strong in the moons' spectra as in Haumea's spectrum.
The moons of Haumea are too faint to detect with telescopes smaller than about 2 metres in aperture, though Haumea itself has a visual magnitude of 17.5, making it the third brightest object in the Kuiper belt after Pluto and Makemake, and easily observable with a large amateur telescope.
Orbital characteristics.
Hiiaka orbits Haumea in a nearly circular path every 49 days. Namaka orbits Haumea in 18 days in a highly elliptical, non-Keplerian orbit, and as of 2008 was inclined 13° from the larger moon, which perturbs its orbit. Since the impact that created the moons of Haumea is thought to have occurred in the early history of the Solar System, over the following billions of years it should have been tidally damped into a more circular orbit. Current research suggests that Namaka's orbit has been disturbed by orbital resonances with the more massive Hiiaka, due to converging orbits as the two moons move outward from Haumea due to tidal dissipation. The moons may have been caught in and then escaped from orbital resonance several times; they currently are in or at least close to an 8:3 resonance. This resonance strongly perturbs Namaka's orbit, which has a current precession of the argument of periapsis by about −6.5° per year, implying a precession period of 55 years.
At present, the orbits of the Haumean moons appear almost exactly edge-on from Earth, with Namaka having periodically occulted Haumea from 2009 to 2011. Observation of such transits would provide precise information on the size and shape of Haumea and its moons, as happened in the late 1980s with Pluto and Charon. The tiny change in brightness of the system during these occultations will require at least a medium-aperture professional telescope for detection. Hiiaka last occulted Haumea in 1999, a few years before discovery, and will not do so again for some 130 years. However, in a situation unique among regular satellites, the great torquing of Namaka's orbit by Hiiaka will preserve the viewing angle of Namaka–Haumea transits for several more years.

Xu Heng

Xu Heng () (1209–1281) was a Confucianist and educator of the Yuan Dynasty in China.
Xu Heng was born in present-day Xinyang of Henan Province, which was then governed by the Jin Dynasty. At the age of 16, he studied Confucian Classics and became enamoured of it. In early 1230s, when the Jin Dynasty was annihilated by the Mongols, he was captured, but soon freed. He then became a famous educator in Confucianism. After Kublai Khan's enthronement in 1260, Xu Heng, along with many other Confucianists such as Liu Bingzhong and Wang Xun, was invited by Kublai Khan to the court. He resigned next year, but was invited again later by Kublai Khan, and became an official of the Zhongshusheng (Chinese: 中書省, "Department of Central Governing"). In 1271, Kublai Khan founded the Yuan Dynasty, and established the National Academy () of the dynasty, with Xu Heng being its first leader (). Xu Heng was then devoted to education, and actively supported the spread of Neo-Confucianism. Later, he helped Guo Shoujing to formulate a new Chinese calendar known as Shoushili (). In 1280 he resigned and returned home, and died in the next year.

Cannabis consumption

Among the variety of ways cannabis is consumed, forms of smoking or oral consumption are most common. Cannabis is a unique drug due to its capacity to deliver psychoactive effects that can include or be any combination of hallucinogenic, stimulant and depressant qualities. Each method leads to subtly different psychoactive effects due to the THC and other chemicals being activated, and then consumed through different administration routes. It is generally considered that smoking, which includes combustion toxins, produces a somewhat more relaxing ("stoned") effect, while eating delays the onset of effect but the duration of effect is typically longer. A 2007 report from San Francisco, US researchers stated that the use of a vaporizer provides the user with the usual biological effect, but without the toxins.
Smoking.
Cannabis can be vaporized or smoked with implements such as bongs and pipes —if needed, a makeshift pipe can be created out of an apple (or any other suitable fruit or vegetable) or soda can— or by rolling a cigarette-like joint or cigar-like blunt.
Local methods have differed by the preparation of the cannabis plant before use, the parts of the cannabis plant which are used, and the treatment of the smoke before inhalation. In early times, as in some parts of Africa today, a pile of cannabis was simply laid on a fire and the smoke inhaled.
There have been many studies and reports conducted that suggest there are much more risks (such as cancer or respiratory diseases) that are associated with smoking more than other methods of consumption.
Vaporization.

36. Flame filter prevents flame from igniting herb which instead is heated to vaporization temperature.]]
A vaporizer heats herbal cannabis to , which causes the active ingredients to evaporate into a gas without burning any plant material (the boiling point of THC is . A lower proportion of carbon monoxide and other toxic chemicals is released than by smoking, although this may vary depending on the design of the vaporizer and the temperature at which it is set. A MAPS-NORML study using a Volcano vaporizer reported 95% THC and no toxins delivered in the vapor. An older study using less sophisticated vaporizers found some toxins.
A pocket-sized form of vaporizer is available as of September 2013—one particular model uses a rechargeable battery, is constructed from wood, and features a removable cover. Typically, portable vaporizers can only be used for liquids, feature pre-soaked wicks, and require the user to operate a cartridge. As of September 2013, a design is available that is electronic, does not require a cartridge, and can be used to smoke any form of cannabis. 
Oral consumption.
As an alternative to smoking, cannabis may be consumed orally. However, herbal cannabis must be sufficiently heated or dehydrated to cause decarboxylation of its most abundant cannabinoid, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, into psychoactive THC.
Food.
Although hashish is sometimes eaten raw or mixed with water, THC and other cannabinoids are more efficiently absorbed into the bloodstream when combined with butter and other lipids or, less so, dissolved in ethanol. The time to onset of effects depends strongly on stomach content, but is usually 1 to 2 hours, and may continue for a considerable length of time, whereas the effects of smoking or vaporizing cannabis are almost immediate, lasting a shorter length of time.
Smoking cannabis results in a significant loss of THC and other cannabinoids through exhaled or non-inhaled smoke. In contrast, all of the active constituents enter the body when cannabis is consumed orally. It has been shown that the primary active component of cannabis, Δ9-THC, is converted to the more psychoactive 11-hydroxy-THC by the liver. Titration to the desired effect by ingestion is more difficult than through inhalation, due to the long onset time for the effects.(citation needed)
Drink.
Cannabis material can be leached in high-proof spirits (often grain alcohol) to create a “Green Dragon”. This process is often employed to make use of low-potency stems and leaves.
Cannabis can also be consumed as a cannabis tea. Although THC is lipophilic and only slightly water soluble (with a solubility of 2.8 mg per liter), enough THC can be dissolved to make a mildly psychoactive tea. However, water-based infusions are generally considered to be an inefficient use of the herb. However, "bhang", a decoction of cannabis and spices in milk, averts the issue, as milk contains the fat in which the THC is soluble.
Fungi.
To kill potentially dangerous "aspergillus", and other microorganisms, researchers Levitz and Diamond (1991) suggested baking marijuana in home ovens at for five minutes before smoking. Oven treatment killed conidia of A. fumigatus, A. flavus, but did not degrade the THC." However, neither this, nor other suggested sterilization methods, degrade microbial antigens or decompose the microbial toxins. Note that many cannabinoids evaporate below ; in particular, the more volatile aromatic oils and terpenes, which give cannabis its distinctive flavors and odors.

Public/Private Ventures

Public/Private Ventures (P/PV) was a nonprofit, nonpartisan, social research and policy organization; it disbanded on July 31, 2012. Its mission was to improve the effectiveness of policies, programs and community initiatives, especially as they affect vulnerable communities. The organization developed new models and performed evaluations of existing initiatives; it also assisted programs seeking to replicate and expand.
History.
In 1978, P/PV was created by the Ford Foundation and the US Department of Labor to bring together the government, business and nonprofit sectors to address the needs of disadvantaged young people. The organization's initial work focused on evaluating and creating strategies to connect these youth to education and jobs. Its work now focuses on a wide range of social issues, including community health, youth development, faith-based initiatives, sectoral employment, mentoring, after-school programs, youth violence and prisoner reentry. 
Early findings from P/PV’s summer youth employment and education programs influenced the 1986 Congress to mandate that federally supported summer jobs programs have a remediation component. In 1995, P/PV’s widely publicized study, "Making a Difference: An Impact Study of Big Brothers Big Sisters", showed that BBBS' community-based mentoring program had positive impacts on a range of important outcomes for youth, including curtailing drug use, improving school attendance and reducing schoolyard fighting. With the support of the US Department of Labor, US Department of Justice, Annie E. Casey Foundation and Ford Foundation, P/PV engaged in the process of implementing and evaluating Ready4Work—a three-year demonstration project designed to more comprehensively address the needs of former prisoners. Both community- and faith-based organizations provided participants with employment services, case management and mentoring. More recently, P/PV published the findings from its Sectoral Employment Impact Study, which showed that participants in sector-focused training programs earned significantly more, were more likely to work, and were significantly more likely to have jobs that offered benefits than control group members. The White House Council of Economic Advisers cited P/PV’s work on this issue, noting that "sector-focused training programs...are one promising approach to fostering collaboration between training providers and employers."
Organization.
Headquartered in Philadelphia, P/PV also had offices located in New York City and Oakland, with staff numbering around 50. Its last president, Nadya K. Shmavonian, began her tenure in January 2010. Earlier presidents include Frederick A. Davie, Gary Walker, Mike Bailin, Rick deLone and Graham Finney. In 2008, P/PV reported an operating budget of over $20 million. Senior fellows included Michael A. Bailin, Wilson Goode, Loren Harris, Geri Summerville, Nick Torres, Tony Proscio and Patti Patrizi.
In 2012, the Board of Directors were: Cay Stratton (chair), Phil Buchanan, Cynthia F. Figueroa, Clayton S. Rose, Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh and William Julius Wilson.
P/PV was funded by a wide range of public and private sources, including:
Public Funders:
Private Funders:
Closure.
Like many other nonprofits, P/PV was hit hard by the economic downturn. Having been unable, even after difficult staff cuts, to find long-term funding to cover its core operational expenses, the board of P/PV concluded that the organization was no longer sustainable in the changed funding climate. Nearly 35 years after it as founded, P/PV ceased operations by July 31, 2012.

National Security Language Initiative

The National Security Language Initiative is a program introduced by United States President George W. Bush on January 5, 2006 at the U.S. University President's Summit to develop the foreign language skills of American students, especially in "critical-need" foreign languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Hindi, and Persian. The initiative was given $114 million in fiscal year 2007 and $26.6 million in 2008 to expand programs from kindergarten level to universities.
Scope of the program.
The initiative is coordinated by the State Department, Education Department, Defense Department and the Director of National Intelligence. 
The National Security Language Initiative has three broad goals: expand the number of Americans mastering critical need languages and start at a younger age, increase the number of advanced-level speakers of foreign languages, increase the number of foreign language teachers and the resources for them.
Criticisms.
Several college leaders have expressed concern about how large of a role the Pentagon is playing in the initiative and, after the program was announced, the lack of details.

Henry Klein

Henry Klein (October 4, 1841 – December 5, 1901) was a Union Army soldier during the American Civil War and a recipient of America's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions at the Battle of Sayler's Creek.
Born in Germany, Klein immigrated to the United States in 1853. He settled in Syracuse, New York, and worked in the clothing business.
At the outbreak of the Civil War, he enlisted as a private in the 101st Regiment and later served in Company E of the 40th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Klein's brother, Philip, also served in the war, with the 149th New York Infantry. At some point during his military service Henry Klein was captured and held as a prisoner of war by the Confederates, although the details of this event are unknown. In one battle, after General Gustavus Sniper was wounded, Klein caught the general's horse and helped him dismount. At the Battle of Sayler's Creek, Virginia, on April 6, 1865, his company was ordered to attack a Confederate position. Under heavy canister and musket fire, Klein rushed ahead of the attack, grabbed a Confederate banner from the flag bearer's hands, and returned safely back to Union lines. For this act, he was commended and granted a furlough.
On his way home to Syracuse, Klein stopped in Washington, D.C., for a few days. While he was in the city, President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. Klein stood guard outside the house next to Ford's Theatre where Lincoln lay dying, and after the President's death he viewed the body as it lay in state at the White House.
One month after Lincoln's assassination, on May 10, 1865, Klein was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Sayler's Creek. The official citation, which was mistakenly recorded under the name "Harry Kline", reads simply "Capture of battle flag." Klein was promoted to corporal before leaving the Army, and then returned to Syracuse where he resumed working in the clothing business. He was a Republican and was active in veterans' affairs. Klein died at age 60 and was buried in Syracuse's Woodlawn Cemetery, on the same lot as his Civil War commander, General Gustavus Sniper.

John Caspar Wister

John Caspar Wister (March 19, 1887 – December 27, 1982) was considered the preeminent horticulturist in the United States in the 1900s.
Family.
A member of the prominent Philadelphian family, the Wisters, John was born to William Rotch Wister and Mary Rebecca Eustis in the Germantown section of Philadelphia. John was the youngest of five children, being the brother of Mary Channing Wister, who would go on to marry her cousin Owen Wister, the author of The Virginian. His family tree also includes well-known individuals such as Sarah Logan Wister Starr, William Logan Fisher, and James Logan.
Early life.
Even at an early age, John Caspar Wister was interested in horticulture; as a small boy growing up in Germantown, Philadelphia, John would follow the gardener around the property trying to learn anything and everything he could about plants, and would spend his time admiring and contemplating the flowers, trees, fruits, vegetables, and greenhouses at the Belfield and Wister Estates owned by his family.
School.
In 1909, Wister graduated from Harvard University and went on to continue his studies at Harvard’s School of Landscape Architecture, and supplemented that program with courses taken at the New Jersey Agricultural College. His education took him to landscape architecture offices in both New York and Philadelphia until he enlisted on July 10, 1917, as a private in World War I.
World War I.
According to letters he wrote to his family during the war, Wister served most of his time in France in various ordnance departments, being promoted to Sergeant of Ordnance in November 1917. Wister never strayed too far from plants and flowers, taking advantage of his leave time by visiting the gardens of Europe. He would often send plants back to his friends, the Arthur Hoyt Scotts, noted garden enthusiasts whom he met in 1915. After being honorably discharged from the Army on May 10, 1919, John Caspar Wister began a horticultural legacy which would span the next 70 years as a landscape architect in both the United States and in England.
Horticultural Work.
John Caspar Wister’s research in cross-breeding produced hundreds of new hybrid species of common plants and flowers. In addition to the scientific research he performed on plants, he devoted a great deal of his time to sharing his knowledge of plants and the beauty he found in them with those around him. One of his many contributions to local Philadelphia horticulture was the campus of Swarthmore College, where he worked for more than 50 years. In order to recognize the work of Wister’s good friends, the Arthur Hoyt Scotts, Swarthmore established the Arthur Hoyt Scott Horticultural Foundation and named Wister the foundation’s first director in 1930. The Foundation’s public garden, with its 5,000 species of trees and shrubs adorns the Swarthmore campus, of which were landscaped by Wister himself. He grouped plant families together within the garden to establish a more practical plan. Swarthmore College awarded Wister an honorary doctor of science degree in 1942 for his work with the college. Wister also operated a landscape architecture business out of the now-demolished Wister Mansion just off of La Salle University’s campus in Philadelphia.
In 1946, Wister became the first director of the John J. Tyler Arboretum in Lima, PA, serving as president of both the arboretum and bird sanctuary until 1968. In addition to this organization, he was active in most major scientific and conservation groups and was a member of about 50 horticultural societies and 30 scientific organizations. He served as secretary of the American Rose Society, president and founder of the American Iris Society, and secretary for 24 years of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. He was also intimately connected with the John Bartram Association in Philadelphia.
Recognition.
Throughout his lifetime, Wister was the first recipient of four major horticulture awards: the Liberty Hyde Bailey Medal, the Scott Garden and Horticultural Award, the A.P. Saunders Memorial Award from the American Peony Society, and the Honor and Achievement Award from the International Lilac Society. He was honored for his outstanding work with flowers at the centennial celebration of the founding of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. The Brooklyn Botanic Garden awarded Wister its Garden Medal for outstanding service in 1966, and in that same year, the Royal Horticultural Society dedicated its Daffodil and Tulip Yearbook to him, making Wister the first American gardener to receive this honor.
Marriage.
Being constantly absorbed in flowers and plants, Wister did not marry until the age of 73, when he took as his wife Gertrude Smith, a woman who was herself a noted horticulturist at the time. Wister referred to marriage as "the fatal plunge" in one of his war-time letters, a description which could also explain why he waited so long before marrying.
Death.
John Caspar Wister, considered America’s “Dean of Horticulturists”, died on December 27, 1982, at his home in Swarthmore. At the time of his death, Wister was director emeritus of both the Arthur Hoyt Scott Horticultural Foundation and the John J. Tyler Arboretum.

The Family (2008 UK TV series)

The Family is a British fly-on-the-wall documentary series that began airing 17 September 2008 on Channel 4. Each season follows a chosen family, consisting of parents and their children. The project aim was to gain a picture of everyday family life in the United Kingdom, as film-maker and director Jonathan Smith attempted to "condense four months of ordinary family life into eight films". The series is a revival of the original series of the same name that first aired in 1974.
The Families.
Series 1: The Hughes.
Series 1 followed the lives of the Hughes family consisting of parents Simon and Jane, and their four children - Jessica (22), Emily (19), Charlotte (17), and Tom (14) who live in Harbledown, Canterbury, Kent. They had more than 20 cameras placed in their semi-detached home, capturing their every move over a period of four months and were controlled from the house next door. The Hughes family were not the original family planned to participate in the first series. They were brought in as reserves after the father of the intended family was found to be a steroid dealer and was consequently pulled from the programme.
The Hughes also have a black cat called Ziggy, who is frequently seen in the series. During filming he went missing for a few days, but later returned safe and well.
Series 2: The Grewals.
Series 2 followed the lives of the Grewals, a British Indian family consisting of parents Arvinderjeet and Sarbjit, and their three children - Mandeep (33), Gurdip (32), and Tejind (23) along with Mandeep and Gurdip's spouses - Gursharonjit (24) and Jitender (36), respectively, who live in west London. The format differed slightly from the first series in that micro-interviews with family members were interspersed periodically throughout the programme, commenting about the issue in the episode.
The Grewals also have two dogs named Rusty and Dusty.
Since the series aired, Sunny and Shay have gone on to present a radio show on BBC London 94.9. and in 2011 began presenting the BBC Asian Network's Weekend Breakfast show.
Series 3: The Adesinas.
Series 3 followed the lives of the Adesinas, a Nigerian British family consisting of parents Sunday and Vicky, and their four British children - Ayo (27), Julie (25), Olu (23), and Ola (15) who live in Hackney, east London.

The next year he got 1 more top ten but fell in the points to 9th. In 1992 he switched to the #19 Levin Racing Olds with 7 top tens.
After the third race of the 1993 season Peck was third in the point standings with S-K Hand Tools and Delco Remy sponsoring the #19 car.

Karaoke Fishtank

Karaoke Fishtank was a British late-night television show which based its format on music videos. The show was hosted by a computer animated fish called 'Vince Finn' (voiced by Logan Murray), who introduced each video in turn before it was played in a humorous manner, such as why Norman Cook is also known as 'Fatboy Slim' (although his real name is Quentin). In a separate introduction he defended Jennifer Lopez, saying her "arse" is not fat, and has muscle. He concludes this by asking the viewers, to "Just ask that fat bird from Emmerdale!". However, during the play of each video the lyrics would be shown at the bottom of the screen, while a bouncing-fish would move so the viewer if they chose to sing-along, would know what to sing and when. The graphics that produced the lyrics were made with the Windows application winOKE.
The show was broadcast on Channel 4 late-night every Friday on their "4Later" segments, and ran between 22 September 2000 – 4 February 2001. It was also created by Televirtual, a sister-company to Broadsword Productions, who were the team behind the CITV Anglia Television show "Knightmare". Claire Zolkwer of Endermol Entertainment was the main producer and director.

Darrell Pasloski

Darrell Thomas Pasloski is a territorial politician from the Yukon, Canada, currently serving as leader of the Yukon Party and as Premier of Yukon.
Early life.
The oldest of three children, Yukon Premier Darrell Pasloski was born in St. Boniface, Manitoba, with his family moving to Saskatchewan when he was a year old. Both of Pasloski’s parents were Eastern European immigrant farmers. Between grades 6 – 9, Pasloski and his family resided in High Level, Alberta, which was booming at the time with 1,000-1,500 people in the community.
Pasloski attended the College of Pharmacy School at University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, though he initially considered medical school. In 1982, Pasloski graduated with distinction from the College of Pharmacy.
Following graduation, he moved to Red Deer, Alberta for his first job, where he met his wife, Tammie, who worked as an X-ray technician in the hospital.
Pasloski took a new position with Shoppers Drug Mart in Red Deer in 1986. The following year, he took over as the store owner. In June, 1987, Pasloski opened the first Shoppers Drug Mart in Yorkton, Sask. 
In 1991, he moved to Whitehorse and took over the Shoppers Drug Mart at Qwanlin Mall and later purchased the second Shoppers Drug Mart on Main Street. 
By 2009, Pasloski relinquished ownership of both Shoppers Drug Mart locations and people began encouraging him to run territorially and for leadership of the Yukon Party. 
Court case.
Pasloski appeared in a Yukon territorial court and plead guilty to charges on September 7, 2005 after the Shoppers Drug Mart store number 299 operating under the corporation titled Darrell Pasloski Pharmacy Ltd. was caught selling tobacco to an undercover minor. The store was first warned in November 2002 and a second incident occurred which resulted in charges on October 23, 2004. His company was fined $400.00 under the Yukon Tobacco Act.
Political career.
Pasloski ran for a seat to the Canadian House of Commons in the 2008 Canadian federal election under the Conservative banner. He finished a close second place to incumbent Larry Bagnell in a four way race in the Yukon electoral district.
Pasloski ran for leadership of the territorial Yukon Party and won at a convention held on May 28, 2011, winning over MLA Jim Kenyon and businessman Rod Taylor. He was formally sworn in as leader and premier on June 11. He was not a sitting member of the Yukon Legislative Assembly at the time of his investiture as premier; however, he won a seat in the 2011 election, representing the new electoral district of Mountainview.

Johannes, 11th Prince of Thurn and Taxis

Johannes, Prince of Thurn and Taxis (5 June 1926 – 14 December 1990) was a German businessman and head of the immensely wealthy, princely Thurn und Taxis family from 1982 until his death.
Early life.
Johannes was born in Regensburg, Germany, to Karl August, 10th Prince of Thurn and Taxis, and Princess Maria Anna de Braganza. He had two older sisters and one younger brother.
Marriage and family.
The Thurn and Taxis family came to massive media attention during the late-1970s through mid-1980s when Johannes married the younger Countess Mariae Gloria of Schönburg-Glauchau, a member of a mediatised comital dynasty which still possessed large estates in Germany after World War I but became refugees in Africa under the Nazi regime and fell on hard times. The couple's "haut bohème" lifestyle located them among the jet set and Princess Gloria's over-the-top appearance (characterized by bright hair color and flashy clothes) prompted "Vanity Fair" to describe her as "Princess TNT, the dynamite socialite", a sobriquet that stayed with her a long time. In the 1970s Johannes threw avant-garde parties and, because he was bisexual, he was often seen in gay discos.
On 31 May 1980 Johannes, Prince of Thurn and Taxis, married Countess Gloria of Schönburg-Glauchau. They had three children:
Upon the death of his father in 1982, Johannes became the head of the Thurn and Taxis family. On 14 December 1990 he died, after two heart transplants within 2 days, in Munich-Großhadern. He left U.S. $500 million in debts and his widow sobered her lifestyle to master the fiscal responsibilities of probating his estate and securing what remained of her son's fortune.

"This article is about the music artist; for other uses, see Xela (disambiguation)."
Xela (born John Twells) is a British electronic music artist, from Walsall, who currently operates out of Malden, Massachusetts. When he is not busy running the Type record label, and writing for Boomkat, he produces electronic music encompassing a variety of styles and moods.
His earlier music combines constructed beats, smart melodies and brittle electronica, which is supplemented by guitar and other instrumentation in later recordings. An obsession with horror soundtracks, particularly from the films of Dario Argento, Umberto Lenzi and Lucio Fulci and the music of Goblin (band) and Fabio Frizzi, has influenced him to produce more atmospheric soundscapes encompassing folk, drone, and psychedelia. His album "In Bocca Al Lupo" fused this style with the doom and noise of Wolf Eyes and Sunn O))) to produce discomforting and loud funereal music. This album, composed of four long tracks, was originally conceived as a single piece, and is inspired by darker themes from Christian dogma and mythology. Since his transition away from IDM, beat driven electronics, beginning with "The Dead Sea", Xela's rate of release has increased significantly.

RY (test signal)

RYRYRYRY... is a character string that was widely used to test a five-level teleprinter or RTTY channel. The characters "R" and "Y" are "01010" and "10101" in 5-bit ITA2 code, also known as Baudot. Thus they are Boolean complements of each other.
Switching between the two characters is a stressful test for electromechanical teleprinters.
Repeated over and over, "RYRYRYRY..." outputs a carrier wave that regularly and rapidly shifts back and forth in frequency.
This signal pattern also provided a test for signal polarity; if polarity was reversed, the test signal would print as "SG".
The corresponding string of complementary characters in 7-bit ASCII is "U*U*U*U*..."

<doc id="19364010" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19364010" title="Reverse vaccinology">
Reverse vaccinology

Reverse vaccinology is an improvement on vaccinology that employs bioinformatics, pioneered by Rino Rappuoli and first used against Serogroup B meningococcus. Since then, it has been used on several other bacterial vaccines.
Computational Approach.
The basic idea behind reverse vaccinology is that an entire pathogenic genome can be screened using bioinformatics approaches to find genes. Some of the traits that the genes are monitored for that may indicate antigenecity include genes that code for proteins with extracellular localization, signal peptides, and B-cell epitopes. Next, those genes are filtered for desirable attributes that would make good vaccine targets such as outer membrane proteins. Those proteins then undergo normal wet lab testing for immune responses.
Though using bioinformatic technology to develop vaccines has become typical in the past ten years, general laboratories often do not have the advanced software that can do this. However, there are a growing number of programs making reverse vaccinology information more accessible. NERVE is one relatively new dataprocessing software. Though it must be downloaded and does not include all epitope predictions, it does help save some time by combining the computational steps of reverse vaccinology into one program. Vaxign, an even more comprehensive program, was created in 2008. Vaxign is web-based and completely public-access.
Though Vaxign has been found to be extremely accurate and efficient, some scientists still utilize the online software RANKPEP for the peptide bonding predictions. Both Vaxign and RANKPEP employ PSSMs (Position Specific Scoring Matrices) when analyzing protein sequences or sequence alignments.
Computer Aided bioinformatics projects are becoming extremely popular, as they help guide the laboratory experiments.
History.
After Craig Venter published the genome of the first free-living organism in 1995, the genomes of other microorganisms became more readily available throughout the end of the twentieth century. Reverse vaccinology, designing vaccines using the pathogen’s sequenced genome, came from this new wealth of genomic information, as well as technological advances. Reverse vaccinology is much more efficient than traditional vaccinology, which requires growing large amounts of specific microorganisms as well as extensive wet lab tests.
In 2000, Rino Rappuoli and the J. Craig Venter Institute developed the first vaccine using Reverse Vaccinology against Serogroup B meningococcus. The J. Craig Venter institute and others then continued work on vaccines for A Streptococcus, B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus auereus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Reverse Vaccinology with Meningococcus B.
Attempts at reverse vaccinology first began with Meningococcus B (MenB). Meningococcus B caused over 50% of meningococcal meningitis, and scientists had been unable to create a successful vaccine for the pathogen because of the bacterium’s unique structure. This bacterium’s polysaccharide shell is identical to that of a human self-antigen, but its surface proteins vary greatly; and the lack of information about the surface proteins caused developing a vaccine to be extremely difficult. As a result, Rino Rappuoli and other scientists turned towards bioinformatics to design a functional vaccine.
Rappuoli and others at the J. Craig Venter Institute first sequenced the MenB genome. Then, they scanned the sequenced genome for potential antigens. They found over 600 possible antigens, which were tested by expression in Escherichia coli. The most universally applicable antigens were used in the prototype vaccines. Several proved to function successfully in mice, and later they were proven to be safe and effective vaccines in adult humans.
Subsequent Reverse Vaccinology Research.
During the development of the MenB vaccine, scientists adopted the same Reverse Vaccinology methods for other bacterial pathogens. A Streptococcus and B Streptococcus vaccines were two of the first Reverse Vaccines created. Because those bacterial strains induce antibodies that react with human antigens, the vaccines for those bacteria needed to not contain homologies to proteins encoded in the human genome in order to not cause adverse reactions, thus establishing the need for genome-based Reverse Vaccinology.
Later, Reverse Vaccinology was used to develop vaccines for antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae 
Pros and cons.
The major advantage for reverse vaccinology is finding vaccine targets quickly and efficiently. The downside is that only proteins can be targeted using this process. Normal vaccinology approaches can find other biomolecular targets such as polysaccharides.

Variable interpolation

In computer programming, variable interpolation (also variable substitution or variable expansion) is the process of evaluating an expression or string literal containing one or more variables, yielding a result in which the variables are replaced with their corresponding values in memory. It is a specialized instance of concatenation.
Languages that support variable interpolation include Perl, PHP, Ruby, Tcl, Groovy, and most Unix shells. In these languages, variable interpolation only occurs when the string literal is double-quoted, but not when it is single-quoted. The variables are recognized because variables start with a sigil (typically "codice_1") in these languages.
For example, the following Perl code (which would work identically in PHP):
produces the output:
Ruby uses the "codice_2" symbol for interpolation, and allows one to interpolate any expression, not just variables. Other languages may support more advanced interpolation with a special formatting function, such as codice_3, in which the first argument, the "format", specifies the pattern in which the remaining arguments are substituted.

Dumont came from a large dynasty of sculptors that included his great-grandfather Pierre Dumont, grandfather François Dumont, father Edme Dumont and children Augustin-Alexandre Dumont and Jeanne Louise Dumont Farrenc. He was a pupil of Augustin Pajou, and in 1788 he won the Prix de Rome. From 1788 to 1793, he lived in Italy, after which he returned to his native France, in the hope a commission from the National Convention during the French Revolution. However he secured no such commission, and began producing small statuettes and medallions for sale. Later, he received commissions for statues of Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon, François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers, and Jean-Baptiste Colbert. During the Bourbon Restoration, Dumont made a monument to Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes (1819) and a statue of French general Charles Pichegru, which has since been destroyed.
Dumont was also a great sculptor of portraits, and notable examples of his work include a bust of his mother Marie-Françoise Berthault, and Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma and wife of Napoleon (1810).

Ross King (author)

Ross King (born July 16, 1962) is a Canadian novelist and non-fiction writer. He began his career by writing two works of historical fiction in the 1990s, later turning to non-fiction, and has since written several critically acclaimed and best-selling historical works.
Career and works.
King was born in Estevan, Saskatchewan, Canada and was raised in the nearby village of North Portal. He received his undergraduate university education at the University of Regina, where in 1984 he completed a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree in English Literature. Continuing his studies at the University of Regina, he received a Master of Arts degree in 1986 upon completing a thesis on the poet T.S. Eliot. Later he achieved a Ph.D. from York University in Toronto (1992), where he specialized eighteenth-century English literature.
King moved to England to take up a position as a post-doctoral research fellow at University College, London. It was at this time that he began writing his first novel.
King's first novel, "Domino", (1995), tells the story of a castrato singer seen through the experience of an aspiring painter in the London of the 1770s. 
In 1998, King published "Ex-Libris", his second work of historical fiction. Set in London and Prague, it chronicles how a London bookseller's search in the 1660s for a missing manuscript leads him unwittingly into a world of deception and murder. 
"Brunelleschi's Dome: The Story of the Great Cathedral in Florence" (2000) describes how the Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi designed what still stands as the largest masonry dome ever built: the dome of the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, completed in 1436. "Brunelleschi's Dome" marked King's transition from novelist to writer of art histories and biographies. "Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling," (2002), follows the four arduous years during which Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel amid the political and religious intrigues of early sixteenth-century Rome. 
King's next book, "The Judgment of Paris: The Revolutionary Decade That Gave the World Impressionism" (2006), was met by much critical acclaim and considerable commercial success. By contrasting the works and lives of the French painters Ernest Meissonier and Édouard Manet, the book chronicles the dramatic transition by which the Impressionist painters changed the artistic vision of the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century. King received Canada's 2006 Governor-General's Award for Non-Fiction for this book.
His next project, part of the Eminent Lives series, was "Machiavelli: Philosopher of Power" (2007), a biography of Niccolò Machiavelli in which King illustrates the personal, social and political development of one of history's most famous political theorists.
"Defiant Spirits: The Modernist Revolution of the Group of Seven" (2010) looked at the Group of Seven organization of Canadian landscape artists that launched Canada's first nationalist art movement in the decades after the First World War.
For "Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling," King was nominated in 2003 for a National Book Critics Circle Award. Brunelleschi’s Dome was on the bestseller lists of the New York Times, the Boston Globe and the San Francisco Chronicle, and was the recipient of several awards including the 2000 Book Sense Nonfiction Book of the Year.

British International School of Jeddah

The British International School of Jeddah (also known as BISJ, The Continental School, Conti) is an international co-educational school established in 1977 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
The Continental School (officially known as the British International School, Jeddah) offers a British-style international curriculum to boys and girls from Pre-school to IB (International Baccalaureate) (approximately pre-K to Grade 12) levels. Patronage is offered by some 20 embassies. The medium of instruction is English.
Curriculum.
The educational syllabus is British in style, however, it has been modified to meet students' requirements. The school offers a full-time day school program for boys and girls from pre-school age up till the secondary high school level. BISJ is also an accredited IB World School. It offers the IPC in the Primary School and the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme for year 12 and 13 (Grades 11 and 12). In years 10 and 11 (Grades 9 and 10) students follow a curriculum which prepares them for the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) examination which is externally marked by Cambridge International Examinations (CIE).
This school is considered to be the most prestigious private school in Saudi Arabia, having been accredited by the Council of International Schools, British Schools of the Middle East (BSME) and New England Association of Schools and Colleges. It is also one of the top 20 International Baccalaureate World Schools and a member of the Cambridge International Examinations: Excellence in Education.
On completing Year 9 at the Continental School, students prepare for the International General Certificate of Secondary Education through Cambridge International Examinations (IGCSE exams). After completing their IGCSE students may then apply to continue at the school in the IB programme for a further two years or move on to many destinations worldwide, including public and private universities and colleges in the UK, the USA, and the Middle East.
The British International School of Jeddah's terms are similar to the three terms of the UK system, with some flexibility to accommodate both Islamic and Western calendars. With slight variations, the school week is from Sunday to Thursday, and the day runs from 08:00 to 14:30, with many weekly afternoon clubs and activities to choose from.
Housed on a purpose-built campus, the school has three separate sections, the Lower Primary School, the Upper Primary School and the Upper School, in addition to the Administration block. Each school has its own individual buildings, play areas and administration. The Upper School has an additional International Baccalaureate Block and Language Block, making up to a total of 90 rooms, two music rooms (one equipped with a recording studio), eight science laboratories, and four computer rooms. The shared facilities include a large sports hall, the Russ Law Hall (which includes a stage and sound booth), a gymnasium, a multi-purpose hall, a cafeteria, three libraries, a clinic, two pools and an outside sports area with running circuit and 100m sprint track. Additional facilities have recently been constructed.
Whilst The British International School of Jeddah is of mixed-ability intake, new applicants must produce their most recent school reports, and undergo admission interviews to establish the appropriate placements, to identify any EFL or SEN problems, and to gauge the degree to which the school could accommodate them.
Recently The British International School of Jeddah has had lengthy waiting lists, and it is essential to make enquiries about the availability of places before any commitment to a move to Jeddah. Places for new external applicants to the IGCSE courses and the IB Diploma are few; students wishing to enter Grades 9/10/11/12 are therefore advised to seek entry to the Continental School at an early stage.

List of songs recorded by Selena

American singer Selena has recorded material for her six LP records (five studio albums and one live album) and has collaborated with other artists for duets and featured songs on their respective albums and charity singles. After signing a record contract with Freddie Records in 1982, Selena recorded 10 songs on her debut album, "Selena y Los Dinos" (1984). Her brother, who would later become her principal record producer, A.B. Quintanilla III, wrote two songs. Their father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., wrote an additional two tracks. After being dropped from the label for being a woman in the male-dominated Tejano music genre, Selena was later signed with Cara Records in 1985 and recorded 10 tracks, which remained unreleased. A year later, her brother wrote and co-wrote four songs on her 1986 record, "Alpha", and band members Ricky Vela and Roger García wrote and co-wrote an additional four tracks. "Con Esta Copa", a cover by Abraham's band Los Dinos, "Pero Cómo Te Ha Ido" and "Pa Que Me Sirve La Vida", were written by Johnny Herrera and Jesús Monge, respectively. The album also featured an instrumental track called "El Tejano", similar to "El Circo" found on Selena's third record "Muñequito de Trapo" (1987). A.B. wrote "Enamorada de Ti" with band member Pete Astudillo, while Vela wrote "Cuando Despierto". "A Million to One", a cover from American singer Jimmy Charles, was written by Phil Medley. Four out of the 10 tracks on "And the Winner Is..." (1987) were written by Selena y Los Dinos band members. Following this release, "Preciosa" (1988) and "Dulce Amor" (1988), were produced by A.B., who wrote most of the album's songs. Three covers, "Cien Años", "Siempre" and "Costumbres" were covers by Mexican singers Juan Gabriel and Pedro Infante, respectively.
In 1989, Selena signed a record contract with EMI Latin. A.B. remained Selena's principal record producer and wrote all the songs featured on the album, with the exception of "Contigo Quiero Estar", "My Love" and "Sukiyaki". The latter, which is a cover from Japanese crooner Kyu Sakamoto, was translated by Abraham and Astudillo. Selena wrote "My Love" and Mexican songwriter Alejandro Montealegre wrote "Contigo Quiero Estar". In 1990, A.B. wrote seven tracks on Selena's second studio album, "Ven Conmigo", while "Aunque No Salga El Sol" and "La Tracalera" were originally recorded in 1985 under Cara Records. In 1991, Salvadoran singer-songwriter Álvaro Torres wrote "Buenos Amigos" and asked Selena to be his love interest in the song. Following "Entre a Mi Mundo" (1992), all songs were written by Selena y Los Dinos band members, including A.B., who wrote "Como La Flor", which became Selena's signature song and one of her most popular recordings. In "Selena Live!", three out of the 11 tracks were studio recordings; "No Debes Jugar", "La Llamada" and "Tú Robaste Mi Corazón" (a duet with American singer Emilio Navaira) were all written by A.B. and co-written by Astudillo and Vela, respectively. On "Amor Prohibido" (1994), the three number one US singles, "No Me Queda Más", "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" and the title track became Selena's most popular songs and were all written and co-written by A.B., Astudillo, Vela and Selena, respectively. While the rest, excluding "Cobarde", were all written and co-written by Selena y Los Dinos band members. "Fotos y Recuerdos", which sampled American rock band The Pretenders 1982 song, "Back on the Chain Gang", was written by their lead vocalist Chrissie Hynde with translation in Spanish by Vela. Selena was featured on the Barrio Boyzz' 1994 single "Donde Quiera Que Estés", which was written by K. C. Porter, Miguel Flores and Desmond Child.
On March 31, 1995, Selena was murdered by her friend and former employee, Yolanda Saldívar. At the time of her death, Selena was working on releasing a cross over album that would propel her into mainstream English-language markets and expand her fan base, particularly among her English-language fans. "I Could Fall in Love", the lead single from her crossover attempt, was written and produced by Keith Thomas, while "Dreaming of You" was written by Franne Golde and Tom Snow. Grammy Award-winning songwriter Diane Warren wrote "I'm Getting Used to You", while Kit Hain wrote "Captive Heart". Two Spanish-language tracks, "Tú Sólo Tú" and "El Toro Relajo", were written by Felipe Valdés Leal and Felipe Bermejo, respectively. Selena was asked to record "God's Child (Baila Conmigo)", a duet with David Byrne, who also wrote the piece. "Only Love", written by Mark Spiro and Robbie Buchanan, was released on Selena's posthumous remix album, "Siempre Selena" (1996). Also released on the album, "Siempre Hace Frio", a mariachi-influence track, was written by Cuco Sánchez. The soundtrack album to the biographical movie "Selena", included the ballad "Where Did the Feeling Go?", "Is It the Beat?" and the "Disco Medley". The latter, a cover version, was written by Norman Saleet for Australian singer Russell Hitchcock. "Is It the Beat?", written by A.B. and Pamela Phillips Oland, and the "Disco Medley" were cover songs written by Frederick Perren, Dino Fekaris, Steve Greenberg, Paul Jabara, Van McCoy, Donna Summer, and Giorgio Moroder. Selena's charity effort, "A Boy Like That", which was a cover from the 1961 film adaptation of the "West Side Story", was recorded to help raise funds for AIDS patients. For the medley ballad, "Con Tanto Amor Medley", A.B. used "Como La Flor", "Amor Prohibido" and "Si Una Vez" to create the song. Selena's last known recording, "Puede Ser", a duet with Puerto Rican/Dominican singer Nando "Güero" Dominguez, was written by Selena's widower Chris Perez and A.B. In 2005, A.B.'s band, Kumbia Kings, sampled "Baila Esta Cumbia", a song originally written by A.B. that featured Selena. In "Through the Years/A Traves de los Años" (2007), Abraham included the track "Feelings", a 1978 song Selena recorded when she was six years old.

Julie Bindel

Julie Bindel (born 1962) is an English writer, feminist and co-founder of the group Justice for Women, which opposes violence against women from a feminist viewpoint.
A freelance journalist whose work regularly appears in "The Guardian", Bindel is described as a "Marmite writer", as readers are strongly divided on her work. Her primary areas of interest are lesbian rights, opposition to the sex industry, modern anti-trafficking campaigns and defending female victims of domestic violence. She has been involved in feminist law reform campaigns for victims of domestic violence and originally began writing as a way to get the message across to the wider public. As a lesbian, she has shared her views and been quoted regarding sexual identity and sexual orientation issues and refers to herself as a political lesbian feminist. Bindel though does not support same-sex marriage and believes that it would be preferable to outlaw marriage altogether and have civil partnerships for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples.
As of 2009 she resides in Crouch End and has written about the area. In August 2010 she entered "The Independent"'s "Pink List" as ninety-eighth of the top 101 most influential gay and lesbian people in the UK.
Early career, activism and research.
Julie Bindel was a teenager in Leeds when she became involved in feminism in 1979, through meeting feminists who were then campaigning about sexual violence and the complacency of the police at the time of the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe. "The Yorkshire Ripper case was my reason for becoming a campaigner against sexual violence". Sutcliffe was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1981 for murdering thirteen women between 1975 and 1980. She states, "I was angry, like many others, that the police only really seemed to step up the investigation when the first 'non-prostitute' was killed." Bindel was angry about the police's advice for women to stay indoors although many had jobs which required them to be out after dark; she was also not happy about the police's assertions in 1979–1980 that sex workers were the killer's target even though, from May 1978 onwards, all the victims were not sex workers by trade. Bindel took part in feminist protests against the killings including flyering mock-up police notices for men to stay off the streets for the safety of women. She continued campaigning against sexual violence, and worked as an unpaid feminist activist working for women's rights. In the 1990s she attended London Metropolitan University as an undergraduate.
In 1990, Bindel was a co-founder of Justice for Women (JFW), a group which opposes violence against women from a feminist viewpoint. "Justice For Women is a feminist organisation that campaigns and supports women who have fought back against or killed violent male partners". They are concerned with issues of mariticide arising from domestic abuse. JFW offer welfare advice, campaign on domestic violence, abused women who kill violent partners, immigration rights, and the dangers women face with the rise of religious fundamentalism. JFW "campaign for changes in the defences to murder so that they encompass and reflect women's experiences of domestic violence."
Bindel's writing on cyberstalking, where a victim is humiliated or threatened with unwelcome email messages at work or to professional associates, has been cited by academics. In 2006 Bindel wrote of a personal pact regarding rape and how rape victims are re-victimized by being "identified, vilified and even criminalised." She shared that if she were raped at the time she would likely not report it to the police because of these concerns.
Bindel's activism is reflected in her contribution to research and writing on feminist issues, violence against women, and prostitution; she was a researcher at both Leeds Metropolitan and London Metropolitan Universities, being the assistant director of the research unit on violence and abuse at Leeds Metropolitan. Her writing features in books and reports she has written, edited, contributed to, or been quoted in, and these are detailed in the bibliography.
Journalism.
Bindel's journalistic writing began while she was Assistant Director of the Research Centre on Violence, Abuse and Gender Relations at Leeds Metropolitan University. She was first published by "The Independent" newspaper in 1998 concerning prostitution in the UK. According to her writing, the life and death of her friend Emma Humphreys in 1998 led her into journalism. Bindel had campaigned for Emma to be acquitted and released from prison following Emma's conviction for the murder of a violent pimp.
In 2001 she began writing an occasional column for "The Guardian", from the start covering gay and lesbian issues, child protection, prostitution and violence against women. From October 2003, her contributions in "The Guardian" became more frequent, and she wrote about the main themes that concerned her: rape, child sexual abuse, domestic violence, men who murder women, men who murder partners, child protection, sex offenders, prostitution, gay and lesbian issues, broader LGBT issues including transsexualism and gender reassignment surgery, human trafficking, sex tourism, women who murder violent men, and lesbian issues. 
Her style is often controversial. 
During her time at "The Guardian", Bindel also broadened her range of topics to include vegetarianism, Barbie, Sylvia Pankhurst memorial, and wrote columns on Andrea Dworkin, Sheila Jeffreys and Louis Armstrong.
Bindel is also a regular contributor to the "Guardian"'s "Comment is Free" forum.
Domestic violence and murder.
Bindel's writing on the issue of violence against women in domestic and personal relationships with men has featured in her journalism from the start,
and continues to do so.
In 2008 her activism and writing coincided when the issue she had campaigned on for over a decade became the focus of government legislation. Since the death of Emma Humphreys, who she helped to get released from prison, Bindel had sought to get a law changed that had historically protected men and penalised women. If men murdered a partner in the heat of the moment, an appeal to 'provocation' had been admissible in mitigation. Such an appeal was not practical for women trapped in violent relationships, because murders carried out in the context of ongoing subjection to violence tended not to occur in the heat of the moment, but would be often be calculated as a solution which provided an escape from violence. Bindel's campaign against violence against women on the one hand sought to resist the mitigation men could appeal to when partners were murdered, and allow the sustained violence women could be subjected to act as a mitigating factor if they murdered their partner. Harriet Harman, Minister for Women and Equality, was of a similar mind on this issue, and legislation was proposed that would change the law to this effect. Bindel explained her support for this legislation in her column. Erin Pizzey, one of the early founders of women's refuges, was critical of the new law, and other newspapers leveled their criticisms at both Harman and Bindel.
Using titles like "Why I hate men" and "Why men hate me", Bindel has discussed her views on men, violence, and the way men relate to women, and what is revealed in their comments about her writing.
Sex work, trafficking and sex tourism.
Bindel has written and worked on issues concerning prostitution and sex work since 1998, and this is reflected in her Guardian writing.
In 2008 Bindel co-wrote a report commissioned by the POPPY Project on British brothels, named "Big Brothel" (a play on the title of the Channel 4 reality TV programme "Big Brother"). The report on 900 brothels found that unprotected anal sex was available in some cases for an extra £10 payment, and penetrative sex from as low as £15. The brothels operated as legitimate businesses across every borough in London; many of the premises involved offered "very young girls", but denied any were under age, and many of the women were from Eastern Europe and South East Asia. Bindel wrote about the findings in her Guardian column, describing experiences such as those of a young woman having sex with twenty men a day, and discussed Harriet Harman's (UK Minister for Women and Equality) plans to make paying for sex illegal.
The report was criticised by 27 leading academics involved in sex work research, claiming that the report was carried out without formal academic ethical approval, without acknowledgement of existing sources, and co-written by a journalist with anti-prostitution views. The POPPY project responded that the report was one they produced independently, that the POPPY project was not an academic institution, and because significant media attention was usually lacking in this area of research it was important to provide a counterbalance to the positive media focus on the sex industry.
Transsexualism and transgenderism.
Bindel's writings on gender reassignment surgery, transsexualism and transgender issues have upset people in transsexual and transgender communities, particularly the 2004 piece that cast transsexual people as ungenuinely transitioning while ridiculing their experiences.
Bindel's first published article on transsexualism was a December 2003 "Sunday Telegraph Magazine" report; it was the first example of coverage of a narrative of 'transsexual regret' in the UK media. Bindel interviewed 'Claudia', a post-operative transsexual, who regretted her decision to have surgery and felt that the psychiatrist involved did not take sufficient care in reaching a diagnosis. Bindel questioned the medical approach in the article.
A month later a piece, "Gender Benders, beware" was printed in "The Guardian" concerning her anger about a rape crisis centre's dispute with a transsexual rape counselor; the article also expressed her views about transsexuals and transsexualism. Many considered the language used to be offensive and demeaning. "The Guardian" received more than two hundred letters of complaint from transsexual people, doctors, therapists, academics and others. Transgender activist group Press for Change cite this article as an example of 'discriminatory writing' about transsexual people in the press. Complaints focussed on the title, "Gender benders, beware", the cartoon accompanying the piece, and the disparaging tone, such as "Think about a world inhabited just by transsexuals. It would look like the set of "Grease"" and "I don't have a problem with men disposing of their genitals, but it does not make them women, in the same way that shoving a bit of vacuum hose down your 501s does not make you a man."
Four responses were published. Julie Hesmondhalgh, an actress who played transsexual character 'Hayley' in the ITV soap "Coronation Street" commented: "Men in dresses with birds'-nest hair chopping off their meat and two veg in order to enjoy the privileges of using the women's bog or snogging their same sex partner without fear of ridicule?! Can someone please inform the intelligent and compassionate Julie Bindel, whose amazing work for Justice for Women I have long admired, that Les Battersby is using her name to masquerade as a "Sun" reporter? And that the "Guardian" is accidentally printing his column?"
In response to the complaints, the Guardian editor wrote that the newspaper received about 200 letters, and noted that international lobbying did not account for all of these, and that most condemned the views expressed in the column, the Guardian for publishing it, and the illustration accompanying it. Twelve of the letters were complaints. The editor said, "Dismay at the piece was registered not only by transsexual people but by doctors, therapists, academics and others involved in the field." Referring to her as "a lesbian activist for the rights of women and children [ ... ] a rare kind of writer who puts her money where her mouth is," he explained that Bindel understood that there were problems with the way the article was written. He echoed the sentiments of one therapist in concluding, "This column, which obscured any argument in discriminatory language, [...] abused an already abused minority that the Guardian might have been expected to protect."
Bindel expressed her views about transsexualism and gender reassignment surgery three years later in the context of psychiatrist Russell Reid's censure by the General Medical Council due to his treatment of some transsexual patients. Reid was the private psychiatrist who had treated Claudia, and her second Guardian article on this topic followed a series of more than 20 reports in the Guardian focusing on transsexualism, Russell Reid and approaches to treatment from the time of Bindel's first article in 2004, when Reid began to be investigated, and his censure and hearing in 2007. The second article appeared after the results of the hearing were announced, and contained interview material with Claudia, and Bindel's views on reassignment surgery.
In the summer of 2007, Bindel was invited to present her views on transsexual reassignment surgery on BBC Radio 4's "Hecklers", a series in which someone argues a provocative thesis, and a panel of speakers challenges them. She proposed that "sex change surgery is unnecessary mutilation". The panelists who opposed this were Professor Stephen Whittle (Law professor and trans activist), Peter Tatchell (gay activist), Dr. Kevan Wylie (psychiatrist) and Michelle Bridgman (therapist and trans activist). She wrote about her appearance on the show in her column the same day, and summarised her position on transsexualism. On his website, Tatchell endorsed Bindel's criticism of "traditional male and female roles and the social pressure to conform to cultural expectations of how men and women are supposed to behave," recognising these as "often profoundly oppressive." But he criticises her for "putting gender theory and ideology before the happiness of individual human beings who feel out of place and unhappy in their birth sex." A year later, in 2008, Bindel's apology for the 2004 piece was noted by Christine Burns of Press for Change when she interviewed her in 2008, and Bindel repeated her apology for the tone of the original piece.
In autumn 2008 Bindel was nominated for the UK LGB rights organisation Stonewall's 2008 "Journalist of the year" award. Stonewall's nomination was protested by independent trans and queer groups. Bindel put out a release via the London Feminist Network, There was a picket of the awards ceremony on 6 November 2008 with mixed support from attendees of the event. Bindel attended, although she did not receive an award. Bindel responded to the protest in a piece in the Guardian which covered the way the LGBT movement had developed since her early days as a radical lesbian feminist. She suggested that the protest was as much about "Stonewall for refusing to add the T (for transsexual) on to the LGB (for lesbian, gay and bisexual).". She detailed her frustration with the bullying tactics of those involved, how she was expected to be part of the LGBTQQI movement, yet was criticised for expressing opinions on trans issues while at the same time being told to be inclusive to trans people and issues, concluding that she wanted nothing to do with it. The protest did not receive mainstream press attention, but was covered in the UK gay press. A spokesperson for the protest confirmed that the protest was about Stonewall rather than Bindel herself: "'We're quite happy to leave her alone,' said Zoe O'Connell from the London TransFeminist Group. 'The protest was very much against Stonewall and not Bindel.'"
Bindel is reported as still maintaining that "people should question the basis of the diagnosis of male psychiatrists, 'at a time when gender polarisation and homophobia work hand-in-hand.'" She argues that "Iran carries out the highest number of sex change surgeries in the world", that "surgery is an attempt to keep gender stereotypes intact", and that "the idea that certain distinct behaviours are appropriate for males and females underlies feminist criticism of the phenomenon of 'transgenderism'." Following the Stonewall protest Whittle invited her to debate these issues again with Susan Stryker, a trans academic and activist from the USA, in front of an audience at Manchester Metropolitan University on 12 December 2008. The debate was broadcast live on the internet, but has not been made available as a podcast at the time of writing.
Lesbian feminism, gay and lesbian.
Bindel began writing about lesbian issues as a radical lesbian feminist before her entry into journalism; her time with "The Guardian" saw her interest on lesbian and feminist issues come to include gay issues, scientific theories about sexuality, the way gender roles are taught to children, the cosmetics industry, cosmetic surgery for women, the media portrayal of lesbian chic, and lesbian child-bearing.
In her November 2008 piece written after the Stonewall protest, Bindel talked about her frustration with being in a movement that insisted she accept trans people, yet resulted in her being criticised whenever she spoke on trans issues. She said that as a longtime active member of the lesbian community she felt uncomfortable with the increasing inclusion of sexuality and gender-variant communities into the expanding LGBT 'rainbow alliance': "the mantra now at 'gay' meetings is a tongue-twisting LGBTQQI." "It is all a bit of an unholy alliance. We have been put in a room together and told to play nicely." "I for one do not wish to be lumped in with an ever-increasing list of folk defined by 'odd' sexual habits or characteristics." "I just want to be left alone. I am not in your gang, I did not ask to be, so please don't tell me I am one of yours, and then tell me off for offending your orthodoxy." In January 2009 she wrote about the radical lesbian feminism of the 1970s and 1980s, and her desire to return to those values. She concluded with an invitation to heterosexual women to adopt lesbianism, saying "Come on sisters, you know it makes sense. Stop pretending you think lesbianism is an exclusive members' club, and join the ranks. I promise that you will not regret it."
Rape.
During her time as a "Guardian" contributor Bindel has begun to write more on issues about rape, such as drug rape and date rape. She is critical of how difficult life is made for women who report rape, how the investigative and legal process ends up with women being dealt with more like the offender than the victim in an environment where some appear to think it is more important to safeguard the rights of men who might be accused maliciously than women who are victims. Bindel responded to the difficulties of reporting and prosecuting rape by saying she would not report it herself, "we may as well forget about the criminal justice system and train groups of vigilantes to exact revenge and, hopefully, deter attacks. Because if I were raped, I would rather take my chances as a defendant in court, than as a complainant in a system that seems bent on proving that rape is a figment of malicious women's imagination." Her writing on rape has appeared in newspapers in the Middle East and India, and her views have been reported by the BBC.
Child protection and sex offenders.
Bindel has written about child protection issues, the way sex offenders are dealt with and biological theories about what drives sex offenders.
Other topics.
Bindel has written articles that depart from themes central to her lesbian feminist background, such as vegetarianism, Arsenal, and questioned the point of gender-neutral toilets at the Royal festival Hall, at the expense of one of the women's toilet facilities there.
Personal life.
Bindel's partner is Harriet Wistrich, a lawyer.
Bibliography.
Bindel has written for the "Telegraph", "Independent" and "Guardian" newspapers, including more than 160 columns for the "Guardian", featured in the online 'Comment is Free' section, she has written several published works:

In the mathematical field of differential geometry, a calibrated manifold is a Riemannian manifold ("M","g") of dimension "n" equipped with a differential "p"-form "φ" (for some 0 ≤ "p" ≤ "n") which is a calibration in the sense that
Set "G""x"("φ") = { "ξ" as above : "φ"|"ξ" = vol"ξ" }. (In order for the theory to be nontrivial, we need "G""x"("φ") to be nonempty.) Let "G"("φ") be the union of "G""x"("φ") for "x" in "M".
The theory of calibrations is due to R. Harvey and B. Lawson and others. Much earlier (in 1966) Edmond Bonan introduced G2-manifold and Spin(7)-manifold, constructed all the parallel forms and showed that those manifolds were Ricci-flat. Quaternion-Kähler manifold were simultaneously studied in 1965 by Edmond Bonan and Vivian Yoh Kraines and they constructed the parallel 4-form.
Calibrated submanifolds.
A "p"-dimensional submanifold "Σ" of "M" is said to be a calibrated submanifold with respect to "φ" (or simply "φ"-calibrated) if T"Σ" lies in "G"("φ").
A famous one line argument shows that calibrated "p"-submanifolds minimize volume within their homology class. Indeed, suppose that "Σ" is calibrated, and "Σ" ′ is a "p" submanifold in the same homology class. Then
where the first equality holds because "Σ" is calibrated, the second equality is Stokes' theorem (as "φ" is closed), and the third equality holds because "φ" is a calibration.

Chiva bus

A chiva (Spanish for goat) or escalera (Spanish for ladder and stairs) is an artisan rustic bus used in rural Colombia and Ecuador. Chivas are adapted to rural public transport, especially considering the mountainous geography of the Andean region of these countries.
The buses are varied and characterized by being painted colorfully (usually with the yellow, blue, and red colors of the flags of Ecuador and Colombia) with local arabesques and figures. Most have a ladder to the rack on the roof which is also used for carrying people, livestock and merchandise.
They are built upon a bus chassis with a modified body made out either metal or wood. Seats are bench alike, made out of wood and with doors instead of windows. The owner or driver usually gives the vehicle a unique nickname.
History.
Chivas were first introduced in the Antioquia Department in the early 20th century. Peasants of the region usually relied on horse-drawn vehicles for the transportation of goods and themselves. In 1908 Colombian engineer Luciano Restrepo and Colombian mechanic Roberto Tisnes imported a chassis from the United States. In Medellin they built the first body. This first bus was used in a route between downtown Medellin to the town of El Poblado. The first models were very basic, with a canvas-made roof and four benches. The body of newer models were modified with a roof rack so peasants could transport their goods.
There is no official account of when this kind of bus first arrived in western Antioquia. In the book 'Memories of my land' "(Memorias de mi tierra)", Colombian writer Alirio Diaz tells about the first vehicles ever to arrive in Antioquia through the Las Palmas Road. The most reliable account is found in the book 'Notes for the History of San Vicente' "(Apuntes para la Historia de San Vicente)" where Colombian author Ricardo Zuluaga Gil narrates the arrival of the first chiva:
The term "escalera" (ladder) was coined because the buses have a ladder, usually located on the rear of the bus. This ladder allows people to put their belongings and goods on top of the bus. The bus became a rural solution to the need of moving both cargo and passengers simultaneously. The most particular and substantial feature of this buses is the combination of wood and metal. However, the aesthetic interpretation given through the years to this buses became the most cultural trademark of rural Colombia in the early 20th century. This aesthetic approach to a tool that became of utmost importance to the peasants developed naturally and some of them have as of today evolved into actual pieces of art.
Symbol of Colombia and controversy.
Chivas are recognized nationally and internationally as a symbol of Colombian culture, in particular of rural Colombia. On the other hand, they have been controversial and a subject of criticism. The main reason being that chivas rather than being a symbol of Colombia's diverse urban and rural culture, they are instead a symbol of underdevelopment and of the rustic hacking of a machine intended to be used in urban areas.
Today.
As of today, chivas or escalera buses are still used as the main transportation system in very poor and isolated rural areas of Colombia, however, in most places they are slowly being replaced by newer, faster and more efficient minibuses. In the cities they have found a service as party buses especially in warmer cities. They are also combined with advertising for promotional campaigns and as tourist attractions.
Currently, these vehicles also are used in various parts of Colombia as walking clubs, provided a good sound equipment, disco lights, microphone, to dance tracks and other accessories that make them look more Rumba and special for example one company that has adapted this type of vehicle is "chivas & travel Colombia " since 1998, comes with this particular variation and also to adapt them for tourism, entertainment and culture, has designed programs education, for poor children also can be used not only for fun, if not, to learn like a classroom, there, children and know their city travel, learning, mathematics, social, Spanish, standards citizen behavior, driving laws, among others.
The "Jeepao" is a similar version of the chiva, but in a Willies Jeep.
Other locales.
Not only can these unique buses be found in South America, but also other locales including the United States. As the population of Colombian Americans and Ecuadorian Americans has risen in New York City; so has the use of this customized bus. Developed into party buses equipped with their own bar, these can often be found carrying partygoers around the city. Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz arrived in a Chiva for the New York premiere of "Charlie's Angels". The party buses are also used in Panama with the term "Chiva Parrandera".

Longmont Museum &amp; Cultural Center

The Longmont Museum & Cultural Center is a municipally-funded museum in Longmont, Colorado. It collects and interprets the history and culture of the St. Vrain valley in northern Colorado.
History.
The Longmont Museum was founded in 1936, and became a division of the City of Longmont in 1970. In 2002, the new $6 million Longmont Museum & Cultural Center opened in south Longmont, nearly doubling the Museum’s exhibition and program space.
The Museum was originally founded as part of the St. Vrain Historical Society. Then, in 1940, the Museum opened to the public with exhibits in the carriage house at the Callahan House. With new growths leading to 1970, the Museum changed from a private, nonprofit organization to a department of the City of Longmont. With the many changes in that the Museum has gone through, it now resides at 400 Quail Road, just east of Main Street in south Longmont with a voter approved $5 million in a bond issue and an anonymous $1 million.
Exhibits and programs.
The Longmont Museum has two permanent exhibits, the Longs Peak Room Interactive Gallery and Front Range Rising, both of which explore the history of Longmont and the northern Colorado Front Range region. Each year it hosts 6-8 special exhibits on a variety of topics. Major recent exhibitions have included "Return to Route 66: Photographs from the Mother Road", "Ansel Adams & Edwin Land: Art, Science and Invention – Photographs from the Polaroid Collection;" and "Edward Weston: Life Work". Special exhibits also feature the work of local artists, current issues in science, and in-depth explorations of local and regional history.
The Longmont Museum hosts a Día de los Muertos celebration each year, bringing in over 1,500 people to see altars from the community, hear traditional music, and try "pan de muertos" and other traditional foods eaten on Día de los Muertos. Another popular education program at the Museum is Discovery Days, an art and craft program for ages 2–5 and a parent.

Twin Groves Wind Farm

Twin Groves Wind Farm is a wind farm in the U.S. state of Illinois, near the villages Arrowsmith, Saybrook, and Ellsworth in McLean County. It consists of 240 operating wind turbines. Each wind turbine stands 270 ft (65.23 m) tall and has three 85-foot-long (35.91 m) blades. The wind farm was constructed from 2007 to February 2008. Twin Groves was the largest utility-scale wind farm east of the Mississippi River upon completion.
Description.
The Twin Groves Wind Farm lies in eastern McLean County just east of Bloomington on Illinois State Route 9. The wind farm consists of 240 Vestas 1.65 MW wind turbines and is owned and operated by Horizon Wind Energy. Total cost of Twin Groves was approximately $700 million. The towers are spread out over of McLean County, near the villages of Arrowsmith, Ellsworth, and Saybrook. The current total capacity at Twin Groves Wind Farm is 398 megawatts. The site produces enough power to power about 120,000 homes, or approximately 1.3 billion kilowatt hours annually.
Revenue.
Between , or 1%, of the total 22,000 acres will be taken up by the turbines. Royalties are paid to owners of the land at $5,000 per wind turbine. The wind farm pays property taxes, of which Ridgeview School District will start collecting $300,000 a year, while Tri-Valley School District will collect between $200,000-$250,000 a year.
Future.
With 240 wind turbines already generating power, Horizon Wind Energy is considering an additional 170 wind turbines, to bring the total number of turbines to 410. Test wind turbines are being placed in eastern McLean County to determine if additional wind turbines can be supported. If constructed, power capacity estimates for the wind farm increase from 398 megawatts to 680 megawatts.

Robert Shapiro (film producer)

Robert Shapiro is an American film producer who was the president of theatrical film production at Warner Bros.
Shapiro started working in the proverbial mailroom of the William Morris Agency. Advancing through the firm's ranks, he served as head of the television talent department and vice president of its motion picture department. He was named as managing director of the firm's London office at age 28. Back in the United States, William Morris named him as head of the international motion picture department in 1974, where he advised directors on writers on the steps they needed to take to get their ideas produced as films by the studios.
He left William Morris to start his own production company and was hired by Warner Bros. In December 1980, Shapiro was promoted from vice president of worldwide production to president of theatrical film production.
Shapiro resigned abruptly from Warner Bros. in July 1983, announcing that he become an independent producer at the studio, based on his understanding of his agreement with the studio that he could become an independent producer "whenever the timing seemed appropriate and beneficial to all concerned". The studio's operating income had dropped $6 million from the previous year, and only one of 1982's top ten box office hits — "Chariots of Fire" — was a Warner Bros. release, and the studio was tied for last with Columbia Pictures in domestic film rentals. He was very promptly replaced by Mark Rosenberg, a 35-year-old who had been with the studio for five years. Shapiro's departure was attributed in industry sources cited by "The New York Times" as due to poor financial results for the studio's films in the previous 18 months.
After leaving Warner Bros., Robert Shapiro Productions has produced films including "Empire of the Sun", "My Favorite Martian" and "Pee-wee's Big Adventure".

Ricardo Flores Peres

Ricardo Flores Peres (Sada, Galicia, Spain, May 1, 1903 - Buenos Aires, Argentina, July 2002), was a defender of the Galician independentist movement, in 1920s and '30s by a means of the Pondal Nationalist Society, and its periodical, "A Fouce" ('The sickle').
Ricardo was born in Sada, Galicia, in 1903. During his childhood, he worked the land, while he studied, with difficulty because his family was poor. In Ferrol, during the period of military service, she knows theater staging of the pieces from Brotherhood of the Language (Irmandades da Fala), and he comes into contact with Galician-Portuguese language restoring activities. His intellectual and literary background is mainly an autodidactic background. In this period, in Ferrol, he makes a political commitment with the Galician independence cause, and he never will give this idea up, throughout his long life.
Political dimension and cultural activism.
Like so many thousands of Galician people in those years, he was obliged to immigrate in 1929 to Argentina, for reasons of survival; but he did not lose contact with the reality of Galicia, keeping the commitment to defending the Galician national rights, while he worked professionally as a metalworker. He joined the Pondal Nationalist Society and wrote in its political magazine, "The Sickle" (published between 1926 and 1936), defending advanced ideas about issues like language rights (he defended the Galician-Portuguese unity (today so-called reintegrationism), and the Galician national sovereignty (he supports the Galician independence, regardless of the autonomy that Galicianist Party demanded).
He was also part of the Irmandade Galega (Galician brotherhood), and of other Galician cultural groups in Argentina. Later he hold the position of secretary of the Conselho da Galiza (Galician Council), Galician government in exile during the dictatorship. Since 1981, when was created the Galician Association of Language (AGAL in Galician), he integrates and supports, until his dead, in 2002, the reintegrationist movement. He never leave his patriotic and left-wing political option.
With Joám Vicente Biqueira, Ricardo Flores is considered an advanced man, due to his works and his articles in "A Fouce", as well as his support for the idea of Galician-Portuguese like an language unity.
Literary dimension.
As a playwright, he actively participated in the cultural life of the Galician community in Buenos Aires, forming theatre groups and writing literacy. He became a recognized author and he made several pieces which show his vision of the traditional Galicia, reflecting his independentist ideas and his defense of the Galician national identity.

A Post-Impressionist and Impressionist painter, Lebacq was alternately a watercolourist, pastellist and portrait, landscape and still life painter. He also painted church interiors (stained-glass windows and paintings). Certain works as "Lumière d'été à Vaux-le-Pénil" or "Le Repos en Terrasse" are impressionist. Initially self-taught, he first exhibited while a soldier during World War I. After the war he enrolled as a student at the Académie Julian at Paris in 1920, and thereafter worked mainly in France.
Work.
Most of the paintings of Lebacq are in private collections. Until recently, paintings of this artist were rather rare on the Art market. Emma Lebacq, wife of the painter, was a wealthy person. So she granted him for devoting body and soul to the painting but not to trade it.

Arceuthobium abietinum is a species of dwarf mistletoe known as fir dwarf mistletoe. It is native to western North America from Washington to New Mexico to northern Mexico, where it lives in coniferous forests as a parasite on various species of fir, particularly white fir, giant fir, and red fir. This is a small shrub which is visible as a network of scaly yellowish stems extending above the bark of its host tree. Most of the mistletoe is located inside the host tree, attached to it via haustoria, which tap the tree for water and nutrients. The leaves of the mistletoe are reduced to knobby scales on its surface. It is dioecious, with male and female mistletoe plants producing spikes of staminate and pistillate flowers, respectively. The fruit is a sticky berry a few millimeters long which explodes to disperse the seeds it contains several meters away from the parent plant and its host tree.

Bakyt Beshimov

Bakyt Beshimov (; born 1954) is a leader of parliamentary fraction and deputy chairman of Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan. Bakyt Beshimov is a prominent opposition leader, famous for his liberal views, and speaking out against Bakiev's and Akaev's regimes.
Early life.
Bakyt Beshimov grew up in the south of Kyrgyzstan, spending most of his childhood in Osh. He was born into a family of teachers. His father was a professor at Osh State University, a university whose president Bakyt Beshimov will later become. He graduated from Lomonosov School. Beshimov graduated with a PhD in history from Kyrgyz State National University in 1977.
Academic career.
Beshimov started his career on the faculty as professor at Kyrgyz State National University. In 1991 he was appointed as the president of Osh State University, becoming the youngest president of a university in Kyrgyzstan. From 2006 to 2008 Beshimov served as a vice-president of American University of Central Asia.
Beshimov also served as a national coordinator of UNDP "Life" Program, national manager of the UN Ferghana Valley Project, and regional expert at the Aga Khan Foundation.
Presently, Beshimov is a visiting scholar at MIT's Center for International Studies and Harvard University's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies. Beshimov is also a visiting professor at Suffolk University.
Political career.
While serving as a president of Osh State University, Beshimov become increasingly outspoken in his criticism towards then president Askar Akaev. Effective reforms of Osh State University gained him large popularity among the students. Thus students erupted in protests, when Beshimov's political activity caused him to be fired. That same year Beshimov ran for a newly opened parliamentary spot from district in Osh, and won a landslide victory. Beshimov became a prominent opposition leader. There were numerous attempts to assassinate and throw him in jail by the Akaev regime. Beshimov played a major role in negotiations with Askar Akaev on succeeding certain roles to the opposition. Under the agreement reached in the year 2000, Beshimov was appointed as Kyrgyzstan's ambassador to India with concurrent accreditation to Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Following the Tulip Revolution Beshimov returned to Kyrgyzstan to served as vice-president of American University of Central Asia. Beshimov was a big supporter of and believer in the Tulip Revolution. After the new government followed short of promises made during the Tulip Revolution, and started reverting the course back to dictatorial rule, Beshimov re-engaged in politics, going into opposition against Bakiev. In December 2007 he was elected to Kyrgyzstan's Parliament (Jogorku Kenesh) on the candidate list of the Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan. He is the leader of the opposition fraction in the Kyrgyz Parliament.
Beshimov pushed forward policies to prevent other Shanghai Cooperation Organisation members from interfering with Kyrgyzstan's domestic issues. This angered some of Bakiev's own advisers.
Beshimov was one of the first politicians in Kyrgyzstan to use the web for engaging in conversation with the youth.
Leading to Parliamentary election in 2010 Beshimov criticized the government for planning to close universities for the duration of the election, arguing that education is not a high priority for the government.
Manas air base.
Bakyt Beshimov came under the intense pressure for actively opposing the Kyrgyz government's initial decision to close a US air base, now the Transit Center at Manas. He was the only MP to vote for keeping the base open. Arguing for the importance of a US air base to the security in Central Asia created further divide between Beshimov and the "pro-Russian" government of Bakiev.
2009 Kyrgyzstan presidential election.
Beshimov was the campaign manager for the unified opposition candidate during the July 2009 presidential elections, which western observers deemed "fraudulent". Beshimov said that exit polls by opposition supporters showed Atambayev won around 60 percent of the vote. Eventually, he was placed under state surveillance during the Bakiev regime with intention to kill him.
Beshimov recently spoke against Bakiev's appointment of his own son as head the Central Agency for Development, Investment, and Innovation. For his views several assassination plots have been made on Beshimov, allegedly organized by Bakiev.
In 2009 Beshimov filed a suit with the Constitutional court of Kyrgyzstan against Bakiev. Bases for the suit was Bakiev broking the law by being an active member of Ak Jol political party The Court rejected the claim.
Several assassination attempts before the election, and escalation of threats after the election, forced Beshimov to leave Kyrgyzstan.
2010 revolution.
After April 7 revolution in Kyrgyzstan, Beshimov was offered the position of ambassador of Kyrgyzstan to the US, which he turned down.
Kyrgyz-Uzbek conflict 2010.
Beshimov actively advocated that the Ethnic Violence in Southern Kyrgyzstan (2010) was provoked from outside Kyrgyzstan. He testified before Helsinki Commission on 27 July 2010 with this view.

Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra

"For the work of the same title by Shantarakshita, see Tattvasamgraha"
Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra (Sanskrit), is an important seventh century Indian Buddhist tantric text that was very important for the development of the Vajrayana Yoga tantra traditions in India, Tibet, China, Japan and Sumatra, amongst others. The "Tattvasaṃgraha" is extant in Sanskrit, Tibetan and Chinese.
Weinberger (2003: p. 4) holds:
The "Compendium of Principles" marks the emergence of mature Indian Buddhist tantra at the end of the seventh century, and it immediately spawned a body of literary progeny that has played a central and enduring role in the development of tantric Buddhism in India, Tibet, China, and Japan. Consolidated over time into traditions known in some Indian circles as Yoga Tantra, they spread as widely as Śrı Lanka, Southeast Asia, Khotan, Mongolia, and Sumatra.
Meaning of the title.
Tattvasaṃgraha may be parsed into 'tattva'+'saṃgraha'. Tattva may be parsed into 'Tat'+'tva' and may also be orthographically rendered in English as Tattwa and means 'thatness', 'principle', 'reality' or 'truth'. 'Saṃgraha' may be parsed into 'saṃ'+'graha'. 'Saṃ' may be spelled as either 'sam' or 'san' as the anunasika ṃ indicates a nasalization of the preceding vowel before unpronounced "m" or "n". Graha (Devanagari: ग्रह) means 'seizing', 'laying hold of', 'holding'.
History and dissemination.
A Sanskrit version of this work was "discovered" in 1873 by Dr. G. Bühler in the Jain Dharma temple of Parshvanatha at Jaisalmer. This version contains also the commentary by Śāntarakṣita's pupil Kamalaśīla. This refers not to the tantra text but the work of Santaraksita which is a compendium of the different philosophies, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist of his day.
Japanese scholarship.
There is a venerable and protracted corpus of scholarship on the "Tattvasaṃgraha" in Japanese.
Western scholarship.
Tucci inaugurated scholarship in a western language on the "Tattvasaṃgraha" with his exploration on the Maheśvara subjugation myth it holds. Snellgrove continued to stake a foundation of western scholarship in both his publication of the facsimile reproduction of one of the extant Sanskrit manuscripts, a publication opened by a scholarly introduction and also his presentation of tantra in volume one of "Indo-Tibetan Buddhism". Todaro has provided a translation of the first section of the tantra, accompanied by a study of the role of the "Tattvasaṃgraha" and associated texts in the tradition of Kūkai, founder of
Japanese Shingon. Weinberger has provided a sound dedicated treatise with his doctoral dissertaion on the "Tattvasaṃgraha" which has established the springboard for further scholarship.

Rand, Lincolnshire

Rand is a small village and civil parish in the West Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated approximately north-east from the city of Lincoln and approximately west from Wragby, and near the A158 road from Lincoln to Skegness. The nearest large town is Market Rasen, about north-east. The village is above sea level.
Rand was the home of the father of the 17th-century English writer James Harrington.
History.
The name derives from the Old English "Rand", meaning "a place at the border or edge". It is listed in the 1086 "Domesday Book" as "Rande".
James Harrington (or Harington), the author of "Oceana", born 1611 in Upton, Northamptonshire, was the eldest son of Sir Sapcote(s) Harrington of Rand (died 1629), and great-nephew of the first Lord Harington of Exton (died 1615).
Community.
The village church is dedicated to St Oswald, which contains a memorial to Sir Vincent Fulnetby (died early 17th century) and his ancestors. The name "Fulnetby", or "Fulnery" in some old records, derives from Old Scandinavian "full+nautr+by" meaning "village of one who has a full share". It appeares in the 1086 "Domesday Book" as "Fulnedebi".
The existing church building dates from the 14th century. It also contains a monument to the Harrington family. A church probably existed here by 1241, and perhaps earlier. The existing building is thought to be at least the third church built at Rand.
The nearest school is in Wragby.
The regional-based civil engineering company UCS Civils, part of the Rand Group of Companies of companies, is based in Rand.

<doc id="19364837" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19364837" title="Operation Solare">
Operation Solare

Operation Solare (also named Project Reckoning in the US.) is the Italian name for an anti-drugs operation involving the US, Mexico, Guatemala and Italy, involving a major Mexican drug cartel, the Gulf Cartel, and the 'Ndrangheta mafia from the Calabria region of Italy. In the operation, some 200 people were arrested in Italy and in the US.
Background.
According to the US Drug Enforcement Administration, more than 16,000 kg (35,280 lb) of cocaine, 450 kg of methamphetamine, 9 kg of heroin, 23,300 kg of marijuana, 176 vehicles and 167 weapons were seized as well as approximately US$60.1m (£33m). Charges pending in the U.S.A. and Italy cover various crimes, including trafficking of cocaine and marijuana, kidnap charges, attempted murder, conspiracy to use a firearm in a violent crime and conspiracy to kill and kidnap in a foreign country.
Indicted.
Among those indicted are three alleged leaders of the Gulf Cartel: Ezequiel Cardenas Guillen, Jorge Eduardo Costilla and Heriberto Lazcano, the leader of Los Zetas. Among those detained from the 'Ndrangheta, are sixteen members of the Aquino-Coluccio clan – led by Giuseppe Coluccio – which dominates the Gioiosa Ionica area in the province of Reggio Calabria. They were identified and arrested in New York and Calabria.
Aftermath.
According to Nicola Gratteri, the Italian prosecutor, the Gulf Cartel is still present in Italy and Europe, despite the operation. "The traffic (between Mexicans and Italians) continues, because the Mexicans sold drugs for an even lower price (than the Colombians) and are content with lower profit margins, so it is considered convenient to buy from the Mexicans," he said.

<doc id="19364838" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19364838" title="Ponder (horse)">
Ponder (horse)

Ponder (foaled in 1946, died 1958), an American Thoroughbred racehorse, was the son of the 1944 Kentucky Derby winner, Pensive and sire of the winner of the 1956 Kentucky Derby, Needles. Ponder, himself, won the Derby in 1949. Pensive, Ponder, and Needles are the second family of grandfather, father, and son to win the Kentucky Derby (the first were Reigh Count in 1928, 1943 Triple Crown winner Count Fleet, and Count Turf in 1951).
A Calumet Farm foal, trained by the Hall of Fame conditioner Ben Jones, Ponder was a closer, meaning he liked to run his races from behind. Jones claimed if Ponder had more often given himself more time to catch up, he would have won a lot more of his races. But those he did win, mattered.
Running in the same years as his stable mates Coaltown and Citation, both one year older, as well as competing against the very good Greentree Stable's Capot who took the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes the year he won the Derby, Ponder lost all four of his two-year-old starts. On January 3, 1949 he broke his maiden at Tropical Park. Winning two more races, Jones still thought of him as a lesser contender for Calumet's chances in the '49 Derby. Actually Ben Jones wasn't sure he had a Derby contender in 1949 and was vocal about it. His other possibility was a colt called De Luxe. But then Ponder ran in the Derby Trial. Although he was beaten by Olympia, it was only by a length and at the end Ponder was rolling. He left Capot five lengths behind. Considering Olympia's record up to that point, a winner on both coasts and the fact that he was the odds-on favorite to win the Derby itself, Jones was impressed.
In the Derby, Olympia led for the entire first mile with Capot right on his heels. Ridden by Hall of Fame jockey, Steve Brooks, Ponder was dead last. He was twelfth after six furlongs and sixth as the field turned for home. And then Ponder began to turn it on. His gain was described as "relentless," sweeping past them all and winning the Derby by three lengths. Capot held on for second, but Olympia had faded to sixth. Ponder had run the last quarter in about :23 4/5ths.
Back then, the Preakness Stakes was more suited to a speed horse with its tight turns and short home stretch. Capot was a front runner and the Preakness suited him well. In the race, Ponder was gaining momentum but ran out of racing room. In their next encounter, the Peter Pan Stakes, the turns were wider and when Ponder got going from his usual slow start, he beat Capot by ten lengths. And then came the Belmont Stakes. Ponder began it as he began the Kentucky Derby, but by now Capot's jockey Ted Atkinson knew his rival. Instead of forcing the pace, he kept it slow allowing Capot to have just enough left to withstand Ponder's fast late charge.
Ponder lost his next two races, as did Capot. But on July 30, they met for the last time in the Arlington Classic. Capot finished 14 lengths behind Ponder whose late kick was perfect for the track. Next Ponder came in second to the older Coaltown, both running a world record mile, and then he won the American Derby over Kentucky Colonel and John's Joy and came in a good third by a head and a neck in the Narragansett Special, with wins as well in the Lawrence Realization Stakes and the Jockey Club Gold Cup (ridden by Eddie Arcaro).
Because of his Belmont and Preakness victories, Capot edged out Ponder as American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse for 1949.
In California on February 11, 1950, in his four-year-old season, Ponder took the San Antonio Handicap from the older Citation. Third was the Irish-bred Noor, another "come-from-behind" runner, imported from the United Kingdom after modest success. (In the United States, his star would rise.) In an overnight prep, he was beaten by Your Host, but beat Hill Prince who came in third and who would win 1950 American Horse of the Year honors.
When he went to stud at Calumet, he produced Needles in his very first crop. Ponder died in 1958.

<doc id="19364863" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19364863" title="Sarah Logan Wister Starr">
Sarah Logan Wister Starr

Sarah Logan Wister Starr (1873 - August 21, 1956) was a prominent member of Philadelphia society in the early 1900s and a dedicated humanitarian.
Family.
Named after her grandmother, Sarah Logan Fisher, Wister was born in Duncannon, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia. Her father, John Wister, was descended from the wealthy Wisters of Philadelphia, while her mother was descended from James Logan, secretary to William Penn. 
Sarah had three sisters. The first, Jane Boas, died in 1869 at age three before the others were born. Elizabeth was born next, followed by Sarah and the youngest, Margaret. Even as a young woman, Sarah was dignified and proper and "held high the banner of family morality." She was seen as the opposite of wild and unpredictable Elizabeth.
Married Life.
In 1901, 28-year-old Sarah married James Starr, a mining official also descended from James Logan. Starr, an 1891 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania who also earned a degree in Mining Engineering the following year from Towne Scientific School, was known for his collection of Chinese stamps. 
Mary Meigs, Sarah’s niece, describes Sarah’s and Elizabeth’s choices in husbands: 
“They selected for husbands, businessmen who were as much alike as Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Their names were Stewart and Jim, both had benevolent faces and handlebar moustaches, and, at parties, chewed on their cigars and listened to their wives… ‘Jim of course never speaks if he can help it…speaking is against his principles’… ‘Jim actually interrupts!’ But his little flare of rebellion was quickly extinguished and I remember only his good-natured silences while Aunt Sarah’s tongue reeled out like a string with a colourful kite dancing at the end.
Later, Meigs describes Sarah’s marriage as "dreary…like a man and wife yoked together like a couple of oxen, plodding along in gloomy silence or to the sound of a monologue."
Homestead.
After her mother died in 1922, Sarah received ownership of the Belfield Estate, a Philadelphia homestead that had been passed down through the Wister family for years, and which had once been owned by the artist Charles Willson Peale. Elizabeth's anger at not receiving Belfield led to a feud between the two sisters that lasted for 30 years, until the death of Sarah’s husband brought them partially back together. 
Sarah made several changes to the estate. Telephone and electricity were added via underground wires, so as not to disturb the garden. Upon the opening of nearby 20th Street, a restraining wall 900 feet long and in some places 14 feet high was built to provide security and protection from heavy traffic and passersby. James added water and rock gardens. Sarah herself added a garden of 100 hybrid tea roses. After a trip to China in 1933, they reworked a section of the garden in Chinese style. “A plastered stone wall, separated by a tiny hip roof and an entrance to it is made through a large vase-shaped gate, on one side of which appears, in red, the Chinese characters which denote the year, month, and day of its erection.” The garden also holds an orange and a lemon tree taken from the orangery of Butler Place when Owen Wister sold it. Belfield Estate is now part of La Salle University’s campus.
Community service.
From 1921-41, Wister served as president of the Women’s Medical College of Pennsylvania, where she set up a $300,000 Wister Fund in honor of her parents. The college used the money to add buildings on the site purchased in 1953 at Falls of Schuylkill. 
She was the president of the Colonial Dames for many years, as well as president of the Women’s Permanent Emergency Association of Germantown, which was founded more than 60 years earlier by her grandmother, and revived during World War II. 
She accepted honorary degrees from Ursinus College in 1933 and the University of Pennsylvania in 1941. 
She was an Associate Trustee of the Board of Libraries at Penn. She founded the Zoe Valley Library at Chester, Nova Scotia, where her family had summered since 1874. 
She also served as the State Vice-Chairman of the WWI-era National League for Woman's Services, as well as the chairman of the Germantown Branch. She raised more than $2 million for the relief of Belgian children. She was also chosen the chairman of the Women’s Committee of the Liberty Loan for the Federal Reserve District. 
With Frances Anne Wister and her cousin Anne Wister, she helped produce a magazine called "The Sparrow." In June 1917, she led the first loan parade for the Liberty Loan campaign, where several hundred women marched from the Woman’s Club of Germantown to the grounds of the Germantown Academy. For the first time, women had charge of booths on the streets where loan subscriptions were received. In 1937, she was an emissary of Pennsylvania Tercentenary Commission of Sweden and was later honored there by the King. 
Wister was also a former Chairman of the Germantown Branch of the Civic Club, and belonged to the Acron Club, the Print Club, Sedgely Club, Germantown Historical Society, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, The Philadelphia Assembly, Athenaeum Society, Fountain Society and the Society for the Preservation of Landmarks.
Historical preservation.
In 1938, she wrote an article, “History of Stenton”, recording the genealogy of those who lived on the Logan family estate and relates stories told by her grandmother and other relatives. She also wrote "History of Belfield", a brief pamphlet about the estate since Peale's time.

Francis Davies

Francis Davies (14 March 1605 – 14 March 1675) was a Welsh clergyman who was Bishop of Llandaff from 1667 until his death.
Life.
Davies was born in Glamorgan, Wales and educated at Jesus College, Oxford, matriculating in November 1621. He was awarded his BA in 1625, his MA in 1628 and a BD degree in 1640. He is also said to have became a Fellow of Jesus College before taking his BD degree, but he is not included in the list of fellows in Ernest Hardy's history of the college. He took the degree of DD in 1661. After being ordained, he was rector of Pentyrch and Radyr in Glamorgan (1630 onwards), and of Llangan with Llantrithyd (1638 onwards), surrendering Llantrithyd soon after becoming a prebendary of Llandaff Cathedral in 1639. His opposition to church reforms led to his losing his parishes at some point between 1646 and 1650, although he received some concessions such as payment of some tithes to him or his brothers. He supplemented his income by running a school and, later, moving to London to become chaplain to the wife of the royalist Henry Mordaunt, 2nd Earl of Peterborough.
After the Restoration of Charles II, Davies became Archdeacon of Llandaff in 1660, and Bishop of Llandaff in 1667. Whilst bishop, he restored the cathedral library and installed the largest bell in the bell-tower. Having never married, he left his small estate to his brother, other relations and his servants. He died on his seventieth birthday in 1675 and was buried in front of the cathedral altar. His gravestone was found after the cathedral was bombed in 1941 during the Second World War.

Professional career.
Early career.
Harris was drafted in the first round of the secondary phase of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft by the Oakland Athletics. In July 1972 he was traded to the Texas Rangers, and made his major league debut for them the following day. He spent the rest of the season as the Rangers' regular second baseman, replacing Lenny Randle. In 61 games, Harris batted an anemic .140.
The following season, , the Rangers moved Harris to center field, replacing Joe Lovitto. In his first, and what would prove to be only, season as a regular, Harris batted .249 with 8 home runs. That offseason, Harris and Bill Madlock were traded to the Chicago Cubs for future Hall-of-Fame pitcher Ferguson Jenkins.
Harris started the season back at second base, where he was the starter for most of the first half of the season. However, after hitting just .195 in 62 games, Harris was sent back to the minor leagues and replaced by Dave Rosello and Billy Grabarkewitz. Harris spent on the Cubs' bench, being used mostly as a pinch hitter and batting .179. That winter, he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for infielder Mick Kelleher.
Journeyman.
Harris spent the next three seasons with the Cardinals and then the San Francisco Giants, serving as a utilityman, playing all three outfield positions along with second base, third base, and shortstop. In , after hitting just .150, Harris was let go by the Giants. He was signed to a minor league contract by the Milwaukee Brewers. After a season back in the minors, Harris played in 34 games for the Brewers in 1980 to close out his major league career.
Japan.
Harris became a free agent after the 1980 season, and for 1981 he signed with the Buffaloes. That season, he batted .268 with 22 home runs and 74 RBI, all of which would have been MLB career highs. The following season, while he batted .272, his power declined, and Harris totaled just 9 home runs and 35 RBI. After another decline the following season, with just a .198 average, Harris' Japanese career was done. He played one final season with the Louisville Redbirds in the Cardinals' organization before retiring.
Overview.
Harris wound up playing 579 games in the majors, and was a true utilityman. He played at least 27 games at six different positions, with the largest number, 212, coming at second base.

David Charles (minister)

David Charles (23 July 1812 – 13 December 1878) was a Welsh Calvinistic Methodist cleric and educator, who was one of the men behind the foundation of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth.
Life.
Charles was the son of a linen draper and grandson of the prominent Methodist Thomas Charles. He was born in Bala, Merionethshire, Wales, and educated by a local Anglican rector (the Reverend J. Lloyd), which led to his continuing his education at Jesus College, Oxford, matriculating in 1831 and graduating in 1835. During his time at Oxford, he lived in the same rooms in Jesus College as his grandfather had when he studied there. Charles remained uninfluenced by the Tractarians, and instead rediscovered his family Methodist affiliations in preference to the Anglicanism he had acquired from Lloyd. He returned to Bala and opened a preparatory school for Calvinistic ministers with his brother-in-law, Lewis Edwards, in 1837. In 1842, he became principal of Trevecca College, Brecknock and remained in position for 20 years, encouraging his students to obtain degrees from the University of London before returning to Wales to preach. Students however disliked his overbearing attitude. He left in 1863 after a dispute, causing the college to close for three years, and was appointed as the pastor of the church in Abercarn, Monmouthshire through the influence of Lord Llanover and his wife Lady Llanover.
Hugh Owen appointed Charles as secretary of the University for Wales movement in 1868, in succession to Thomas Nicholas. He attracted support and donations from lower-class subscribers, in comparison to the approach taken by Nicholas, but this raised little and the efforts of others were needed to keep the scheme going. Charles was annoyed not to be appointed as the first principal of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth—the position going to his nephew, Thomas Charles Edwards, in 1872—and he resigned, settling in Aberdovey. He died there on 13 December 1878, and was buried at Llanidloes.

311th Air Division

The 311th Air Division (311th AD) is an inactive United States Air Force organization. Its last assignment was with Strategic Air Command, stationed at Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas. It was inactivated on 1 November 1949.
History.
The 311th came into existence in February 1944, at Bolling Field, DC, as the 311th Photographic Wing, and had its headquarters in the United States for its entire active period. Subordinate units, between February 1944 and August 1945, deployed to diverse areas of the world such as Africa, the Middle East, the China Burma India Theater, Mexico, Canada, Alaska, and the Caribbean. These units conducted mapping and charting operations, and in some instances flew reconnaissance missions.
After World War II, the 311th transferred to Continental Air Forces (later, Strategic Air Command) at Buckley Field, CO. In March 1946, it became the major reconnaissance organization of Strategic Air Command.
The 311th was SAC's first major reconnaissance organization. Its components were scattered around the world and moved several times. It was initially moved to MacDill Field on 17 April 1946, but a month later it was transferred to Andrews AFB. On 20 July 1948 it moved to Topeka AFB Kansas and a month later to Barksdale AFB, Louisiana. The 311th had five squadrons: 1st, 12th, 16th, 91st, and 46th/72nd recon squadrons.
The unit was redesignated as the 311th Air Division Reconnaissance two years later, on 16 April 1948, and inactivated on 1 November 1949.

Posey vest

A Posey vest is a type of medical restraint used to restrain a patient to a bed or chair. Its name comes from the J.T. Posey Company, its inventor, though the term "Posey" is used generically to describe all such devices. The vest is placed on the patient, and meshy straps extending from each corner are tied either individually to each side of the bed or together to the back of a chair. Poseys are most often used to prevent patients from injuring themselves by falling or climbing out of the bed or chair. They allow patients the freedom to move around their arms and legs if no limb restraints have been applied.
Laws in many places require Posey vests be applied with the opening at the patient's front. Misuse in which a Posey vest is applied backwards has resulted in patients being choked to death. Many lawsuits have been litigated in which a patient has died while restrained by a Posey.
Variations.
A cushion belt is a belt that does not include a vest, and simply fastens around the waist, and is tied to the sides of a bed or to a chair. 
An alternate version of the Posey is a vest that is placed on with an opening in the back and a back zipper, and straps that extend from the sides.

Jami Mosque, Toronto

Located just east of High Park in Toronto, Jami Mosque (مسجد جامع) is the oldest Canadian Islamic centre in the city and dubbed "the mother of all the mosques in Toronto".
Built in 1910 as a Presbyterian church, the building was purchased in 1969 by Toronto's small, predominantly Balkan, Muslim community and converted into the city's first worship centre. 
In November 1977, Ahmed Khadr and Maha el-Samnah were married at the mosque.
While Jami originally held a large number of Tablighi Jamaat followers, the numbers declined after a large influx of Gujarati Muslims immigration led to the leasing of a hall in eastern Toronto; and the eventual 1981 purchase of a building converted to Madina Mosque, which became the spiritual hub of Tablighi Jamaat. Jami then drifted towards finding leadership in the Muslim Students Association.

Blackout convention

Blackout is a convention for responding to a reverse bid, whereby the responder can show whether or not he has any better than a minimum response. The responder bids the lower of the fourth suit or 2NT to show a hand that has no game interest opposite a reverse. All other bids show reasonable hands, generally in the eight point range. The objective of Blackout is to allow the constructive game going hands to slow down the auction and give more room for the strong auctions that may lead to potential slams.
Responder then rebids as follows: 
Variation.
An alternate scheme:
Deficiencies.
The precise scenario wherein Blackout is invoked occur quite rarely. Playing one session of bridge a week it is likely that Blackout would be used no more than once or twice a year. The conventional meanings attached to various bids, above, are likely to be forgotten. 
The following is a critique of Blackout:
There are a number of conventional treatments and Blackout is the best known. In its simplest form, when responder’s second bid is the cheaper of 2NT or the fourth suit it is “Blackout” advising partner that the bidder is minimum, all other continuations are game forcing. There are several variations on this theme, reverse Blackout for example. These are my criticisms... So much more commonly will the partnership be at the limit of its resources, simple bids like a return to opener’s first suit or a repeat of responder’s are better played as natural and non-forcing. The opener has begun to describe his hand, in fact he has, generally, placed nine or more of his cards in two suits. A strong responder should be able, through 2NT, to allow opener to continue to describe, to find the perfect fit whenever it exists, search out the best game or make a slam investigation. Using 2NT as the prime means of continuing with strong hands is simple, and it frees up other bids, even in the fourth suit, as natural and limited. Mis-fit hands can be diagnosed quickly and the level kept low. To use a new suit bid for no other purpose than to announce a bad hand is self-evidently wasteful. Having at your disposal, means of getting out cheaply and accurately, permits opener to reverse, and thereby not conceal his actual shape, on any hand above the minimum re-bid range.

<doc id="19365219" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19365219" title="Mail chute">
Mail chute

A mail chute is a largely defunct letter collection device used in early multi-storey office buildings, hotels, apartment buildings and other high rise structures. Letters were dropped from the upper storeys and collected (usually at the ground level) at a central depository by the postal service. This innovation was before the time of the modern "mail room" normally associated nowadays with high rise buildings. It was for the convenience of the users of the building so they would not have to take their mail to an outside mail box or to the post office.
Original design and usage.
James Goold Cutler received a patent on September 11, 1883 for the mail chute. The first one was installed in 1884 in the Elwood Building in Rochester, New York. Cutler ultimately received thirty patents for variations of his invention. The original approved patent No. 284,951 design stated that it must "be of metal, distinctly marked U.S. Letter Box," and that the "door must open on hinges on one side, with the bottom of the door not less than 2'6" above the floor." If the building was more than two storeys then the collection box was to be outfitted with a cushion to prevent injury to the mail. The mail chutes had to be accessible along its entire length so lodged mail could be removed.
The first experimental "Cutler mail chute" device was successful at the Elwood Building so later it was installed in two New York City office buildings. Additional ones were then installed in railroad stations and some public buildings as a test. Eventually Cutler Mail Box produced over 1,600 such devices in buildings over the next twenty years. Then the postal service allowed "Cutler mail chutes" to be placed in hotels taller than five storeys. They were also installed in public apartment buildings of more than fifty apartments.
It was announced on Sunday, May 9, 1909, by the New York Times, "Cutler and Other Companies Join in a $2,000,000 Corporation".
It is possible for clogs form in a mail chute. For two weeks in 1986, more that 40,000 letters accumulated in the mail chute of the McGraw-Hill Building in New York City. In 1999, a spokesperson for the New York district of the Postal Service claimed that the service responded to two or three calls to clear stuck mail chutes every week.
Current use.
In more recent decades, buildings such as Chicago's John Hancock Center, the Chrysler Building, and the old RCA Building in New York City have shut down their chutes. The reason is the increase of modern mail rooms in the building lobby with associated mail boxes available for the building tenants. There remain, however, about 360 buildings in Chicago with mail chutes, and more than 900 active chutes exist in Manhattan and the Bronx of New York City alone, as well as elsewhere. Since 1997, however, the National Fire Protection Association has banned mail chutes in all new building construction. Buildings currently using mail chutes in New York include the Chanin Building, Trinity Building, Empire State Building, Port Authority Bus Terminal, and in Boston the historic Lenox Hotel in the Back Bay. 
Other installations.
The London Transport HQ at 55 Broadway had a system installed. The chute slot for 'London & Abroad' mail plate says 'Cutler Mailing-System Cutler-Mail-Chute-Co Rochester,NY,USA'.(As shown BBC 'Art Deco Icons: London Transport' TV programme aired Nov 09.)

Face the Music Tour

The Face the Music/Club Tour was a worldwide concert tour by the band NKOTB, also known as New Kids On The Block, undertaken in late 1993 to mid-1994 in support of their fourth album "Face the Music". It was their last tour for nearly fifteen years until they reunited in 2008 for . They performed songs like "Never Let You Go" and "Dirty Dawg".
Overview.
Although "Face the Music" was not a commercial hit, NKOTB went on tour to support the album and reconnect with their fanbase. While they retained massive popularity throughout Europe, Asia, and the United Kingdom, they struggled to find bookings at venues in North America. They ended up performing in nightclubs and theaters, which was a far cry from the sports stadiums and arenas they had become accustomed to playing in at the height of their fame.
During the group's touring of Italy in early 1994, group member Jonathan Knight dropped out and retired to his farm in Massachusetts, struggling with panic attacks and anxiety. According to Donnie Wahlberg on the "Behind the Music" special, Knight was reluctant to quit, so his leaving was agreed upon by a group vote. To explain his absence, the band stated on an appearance on "The Arsenio Hall Show" that he had been injured after falling off a horse. 
Despite selling out theaters, NKOTB felt that the fanbase had grown up and moved onto grunge music and gangsta rap. By June of that year, the rest of the group decided to disband after the final concert in Massachusetts.

William F. Howe (lawyer)

William F. Howe (1828 - September 2, 1902) was an American trial lawyer with the New York firm Howe and Hummel.
Life and career.
William Frederick Howe was born in Southwark, London, England on 20 August 1828, the eldest of three sons of working class parents: Samuel and Mary Ann Howe. City of London records show that his early career was as a legal clerk but that in 1854 he was convicted with others at the Old Bailey for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and served a short prison sentence. He then moved to the USA and resumed his legal career, claiming to have been born in Boston, Massachusetts. He became a naturalised American on 19 September 1863 in New York where he founded Howe and Hummel with Abraham Hummel (1849-January 21, 1926). Howe handled most of the firm's criminal work, participating in more than 600 murder trials in the course of his fifty-year career and winning a large but unstated proportion of them. He was noted for his extravagant dress, favouring bright waistcoats and large jewelled rings - although he steadily dressed down as a capital trial progressed, invariably ending it in a funereal suit and black tie. He had a markedly florid rhetorical style, on one occasion delivering an entire summing-up, two hours long, while on his knees before the jury box. One of his most remarked upon talents was an apparent ability to weep at will, although legal historian Sadakat Kadri notes that his frequent opponent Francis L. Wellman "suspected that he used an onion-scented handkerchief to get in the mood". The less extrovert but more intelligent Hummel specialised in civil law and ran the firm's thriving blackmail racket, representing chorus girls and thwarted lovers, threatening married men with exposure and well-off young bachelors with suits for breach of promise of marriage.
At its peak, operating from offices just across the road from NYPD headquarters on Centre Street, Howe and Hummel received fat retainers from a significant proportion of the criminals, brothel-keepers, and abortionists of New York. All 74 madams rounded up during a purity drive in 1884 named Howe and Hummel as their counsel, and at one time the firm represented 23 out of the 25 prisoners awaiting trial for murder in the city's Tombs prison and had an undeclared interest in the twenty-fourth.
Bill Howe's persuasive abilities were the stuff of legend. Perhaps his most notable achievement was to get a client, Ella Nelson, acquitted on a charge of wilful murder. Howe admitted that the girl had been armed with a revolver, but successfully persuaded a jury that her trigger finger had accidentally slipped not just once, but four times in the course of an argument with her married lover.
One of Howe's most notorious cases, however, may have been that of John Dolan (a.k.a. Johnny Dolan), convicted in the murder of merchant James H. Noe. Despite a desperate legal to save his life, Dolan went to the gallows on April 21, 1875. "New York Times" coverage of the case, which riveted New York for several months, identifies one William F. Howe as Dolan's attorney. In a noticeable omission, the "Times" does not mention Dolan in its obituary for Howe. 
Howe and Hummel kept no records, actively courted publicity, and were much discussed in their day among the members of the legal profession. As such, many of the stories told about them have the aura of tall tales. Nevertheless, their decades of effective practise suggest that the partners were among the most effective and innovative attorneys to practice in the United States during the nineteenth century.
The final collapse of the firm came in 1907, five years after Howe's death, when Hummel was convicted in New York of suborning perjury, disbarred, and sentenced to a year in jail. After his release, Hummel left the United States and lived chiefly in Paris.
Howe, who died of a heart attack in 1902, married at least three times, once in the United Kingdom and at least twice in the USA. He was survived by two of his wives, one adopted daughter and several grandchildren. There is an extended family still in the UK, descended from his brother Ferdinand who he was close to for his entire life.

Yzma (Eartha Kitt) comes up with a new way to stop Kuzco (J.P. Manoux) from graduating. She wastes school funds which causes the academy to go bankrupt, and she tries to tear it down. Malina (Jessica DiCicco) asks Yzma if she can give them two days to raise enough money to save the school. She decides to do a school musical. It seems to be a horrible plan when no one is good enough to be in it. Things are saved when Yatta gets a pop superstar, Dirk Brock (Joey Lawrence), to perform in the musical. Kuzco can't star in the musical anymore, so he tries to get rid of Dirk. Yzma also tries to get rid of Dirk. Kuzco getting rid of Dirk Brock could cause Malina to hate him. He goes through with it by giving Dirk a "laryngitis" potion and causing him to lose his voice. But, in the end, Kuzco does the right thing by fixing Dirk's voice, and even when Yzma comes and the things go wrong for a little time, they save the academy, and Malina becomes proud enough of Kuzco she is willing to kiss him and follows through. During the end credits, they have an argument about if it was real or just acting.

Fabula palliata

Fabula palliata or Palliata (plural Fabulae palliatae or palliatae) are names assigned by the Romans to a genre of comedy (Comoedia palliata) that reworked in Latin the themes of Greek New Comedy. The genre began with the comedies of Livius Andronicus, who also initiated Roman literature and Roman drama. 
The name comes from the "pallium", a small cape traditionally worn by the actors who performed in this type of play, in imitation of the himation worn by Greek actors.
Definition and history of the concept.
Knowledge of the genre comes from a 1st-century BC literary critic named Volcacius Sedigitus, of whom nothing is known except his report in Aulus Gellius. Of the writers whose works have survived at all Sedigitus identifies as well Naevius, Plautus, Ennius, Caecilius and Terence as contributors to the genre. In addition were Licinius, Atilius, Turpilius, Trabea and Luscius Lanuvius.

It was sponsored by Coca-Cola and tied into its "Magic Summer '90" campaign that included the infamous MagiCan flop. At the time, it was the second-highest-grossing tour ever in North America, behind only The Rolling Stones's 1989 Steel Wheels Tour. When the tour continued into 1991, it was retitled the No More Games Tour to capitalize on the release of the group's No More Games/The Remix Album.
During an encore performance of "Hangin' Tough" at the end of the second concert held at Saratoga Springs on June 25, Donnie Wahlberg fell through a trapdoor while jumping off a raised platform. He received scrapes and bruises to his chest, neck and arms. After being hospitalized for a night, he spent a week recuperating, and the rest of the band continued the next few concerts as a four-piece act.

After its inauguration in Bairro Alto, new spots have “opened its doors” in São Bento and Amoreiras, where new and classic talents unite to promote the best of national and international street art. It can be seen after January 29.
In July 2008, Leo Burnett transformed the streets of Bairro Alto – Lisbon’s bohemian quarter - into a true outdoor museum. The concept fit in perfectly with the Lisbon streets, known for being the stage for the graffiti cult and other forms of street art. In these very streets, the Ephemeral Museum is born.
The Museum’s success was immediate. Soon, and keeping up the same concept, São Bento and Amoreiras were elected as the new sites for the Museum’s expansion as a dynamic space in constant growth, with the endless ambition of becoming the world’s largest street gallery. 
The idea jump-started when Leo Burnett set up a marketing plan for Pampero’s rum, creating a place where everyday street artists could be acknowledged. For this vision to become reality, careful analysis of street art manifestations had to take place (graffiti, stencils, stickers) in order to separate true art from vandalism. We identify and catalogue the works (author and title). 
Most importantly, it makes sense to state that this project is in no means an incentive for graffiti creation and acts of vandalism (which are normally associated to street art), but as a project that aims to draw attention to the need of a space that voices out and exhibits this style of art as an independent form of manifestation from vandalism, similar to the example in the Tate Modern Museum, in London.
In the new sites located in São Bento and Amoreiras, it’s possible to contemplate the work of various generations of artists from all over the world. The galleries renown such artists like Exas, Creyz, Rote, Eko and Mito, Time, Pariz, Youth, From the Cave, Mace, as well as the international Kenor. Bairro Alto exhibits the works of international artists Dolk and Jef Aerosol, as well as national artists in the making such as Efeito Magenta and O Colectivo Bitmap.

Arceuthobium divaricatum

Arceuthobium divaricatum is a species of dwarf mistletoe known as pinyon dwarf mistletoe. It is native to the southwestern United States and Baja California, where it lives in woodlands as a parasite on various species of pine, particularly Colorado Pinyon and Single-leaf Pinyon. This is a small shrub which is visible as a network of scaly brown or greenish stems no more than 12 centimeters long extending above the bark of its host tree. Most of the mistletoe is located inside the host tree, attached to it via haustoria, which tap the tree for water and nutrients. The leaves of the mistletoe are reduced to thin scales on its surface. It is dioecious, with male and female mistletoe plants producing spikes of staminate and pistillate flowers, respectively. The fruit is a sticky berry a few millimeters long which explodes to disperse the seeds it contains several meters away from the parent plant and its host tree.

Northern American English

Northern American English (Northern AmE, also rendered as northern American English) is the variety of the English language used in the northern United States. Among the oldest and most pervasive of American English patterns, it is particularly used in New England, New York, New Jersey, and northeastern Pennsylvania, and the dialects extend beyond the Mississippi across northern Iowa, Minnesota, and the Dakotas.
Canadian English is believed by some scholars to have originated from northern American English, or to simply be a variety of it.

Smoking in New Zealand

The use of tobacco for smoking in New Zealand has been subjected to government regulation for a number of decades. On 10 December 2004, New Zealand became the third country in the world to make all indoor workplaces including bars and restaurants smoke-free.
Consumption.
The number of cigarettes available for consumption, a statistical measure that reflects sales, has generally been decreasing since they peaked at 6.3 billion in 1977 but consumption has remained constant from 2005 through to 2008 at 2.4 billion cigarettes. Over the last 30 years the number of cigarettes that have been available has dropped by 61.5%. The volume of tobacco available for consumption rose to a new high of 904 tonnes and was 83.3 percent higher than the lowest amount recorded in 1985.
Legislation.
The first building in the world to have a smoke-free policy was the Old Government Building in Wellington, New Zealand, in 1876. This policy was enacted over concerns about the threat of fire, as it is the second largest wooden building in the world.
The earliest attempt at tobacco control was in 1907, when the government moved to ban tobacco sales to persons under the age of 16, as it was feared that tobacco would "stunt" a minor's growth. However, this law was not enforced until 1988. In 1997, the age restriction was increased to 18 years. Although it is now illegal to sell tobacco products to a minor, a minor may still publicly consume, possess and distribute tobacco to friends without penalty (as opposed to alcohol).
The Smoke-free Environments Act 1990 was passed to prevent the effects of passive smoking on other people by restricting cigarette smoking in places such as workplaces and schools.
New Zealand passed an amendment to the Smoke-free Environments Act 1990 law on 3 December 2003 (effective in 2004) which covers all indoor public workplaces and hospitality venues (pubs, bars, nightclubs, charter club bars, restaurants and casinos). Studies have shown very high levels of compliance with the law. Also, the air quality at indoor hospitality venues is very good compared to similar settings in other countries where smoking is still permitted.
Outdoor smoke-free laws cover the grounds of all schools, some council-owned parks (e.g., in South Taranaki and Upper Hutt), the grounds of some hospitals, stadiums and several university campuses (e.g. Massey University, University of Auckland, AUT). However, these laws are not strictly enforced apart from a polite request from security guards and property owners. The government has not moved to restrict smoking in cars, but has run mass media campaigns that promote smoke-free cars and homes.
Smoking on domestic flights was banned in 1988 and on all international flights as of 1996.
Cigarette advertising was banned on TV and radio in 1963, on cinemas and billboards in 1971, and in print media in 1990. Tobacco sponsorship was phased out in 1995 and tobacco signage banned from outside shops the same year. Tobacco displays themselves were banned in 2012.
The sale of single cigarettes was banned in early 1998, and cigarettes are required to be sold in packs of no less than 20.
The New Zealand government's "National Drug Policy 2007-2012" seeks to reduce the effects of tobacco use by limiting availability, limiting the use of tobacco, and reducing harm from existing tobacco use.
Lobbying.
On 5 September 2007, Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) called for the removal of tobacco from sale by 2017. Tobacco displays in shops were banned in 2012.

<doc id="19365782" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19365782" title="Greg Hoglund">
Greg Hoglund

Michael Gregory "Greg" Hoglund is a recognized author, researcher, and serial entrepreneur in the cyber security industry. He is the founder of several companies, including Cenzic and HBGary. Hoglund contributed a great deal of early research to the field of rootkits, software exploitation, buffer overflows, and online game hacking. His later work focused on computer forensics, physical memory forensics, malware detection, and attribution of hackers. He holds a patent on fault injection methods for software testing, and fuzzy hashing for computer forensics. Due to an email leak in 2011, Hoglund is well known to have worked for the U.S. Government and Intelligence Community in the development of rootkits and exploit material. It was also shown that he and his team at HBGary had performed a great deal of research on Chinese Government hackers commonly known as APT (Advanced persistent threat). For a time, his company HBGary was the target of a great deal of media coverage and controversy following the 2011 email leak (see below, Controversy and Email Leak). Regardless, HBGary continued to grow and was successfully acquired by a large defense contractor.
Entrepreneurship.
Hoglund has founded several security startup companies which were are still in operation today:
Research and Authorship.
As an author, Hoglund wrote "Exploiting Software: How to Break Code", "Rootkits: Subverting the Windows Kernel" and "Exploiting Online Games: Cheating Massively Distributed Systems", and was a contributing author on "Hack Proofing Your Network: Internet Tradecraft". He was a reviewer for the "Handbook of SCADA/Control Systems Security". He has presented regularly at security conferences such as Black Hat Briefings, DEF CON, DFRWS, FS-ISAC, and RSA Conference, among others. Hoglund drew the attention of the media when he exposed the functionality of Blizzard Entertainment's Warden (software), used to prevent hacking in the popular game World of Warcraft.
Controversy and Email Leak.
HBGary found controversy in 2011 after corporate emails were leaked from the now defunct sister company HBGary Federal. Of particular note, the founder of HBGary Federal, Aaron Barr, had authored a draft powerpoint presentation on information warfare(IW) that was the subject of much interpretation by online reporters and bloggers. It outlined controversial information warfare strategies and techniques, including background checks to discredit online reporters/bloggers, OSINT monitoring of detractors, and disinformation to discredit Wikileaks. This presentation was never shown to be used, and the supposed customers of this work were never actually customers of HBGary Federal, and further stated they were not aware of the presentation.
After the incident in 2011, several hackers branded the attack on HBGary as the work of Anonymous. Later, this branding was abandoned and replaced with the hacking group LulzSec. At this time, the identities of the hackers behind LulzSec were not known. In an interview after the attack, Hoglund characterized the group as criminal hackers and revealed that he had recently refocused HBGary's attribution team, previously used to hunt down Chinese APT (Advanced persistent threats), to instead discover the identities of the Lulzsec hackers.
rootkit.com.
Hoglund also founded and operated rootkit.com, a popular site devoted to the subject of rootkits. Several well known rootkits and anti-rootkits were hosted from rootkit.com, including "Jamie Butler's FU rootkit", "Hacker Defender by HF", "Bluepill by Joanna Rutkowska and Alexander Tereshkin", "ShadowWalker by Sherri Sparks", "FUTo by Peter Silberman", "BootKit by Derek Soeder (eEye)", and "AFX Rootkit by Aphex". A complete list can be found on the wayback engine for rootkit.com Last snapshot of rootkit.com on Wayback. Rootkit.com's original site administrators were Greg Hoglund, Fuzen_Op (Jamie Butler), Barns (Barnaby Jack), Caezar of GhettoHackers (Riley Eller), Talis (JD Glaser of NTObjectives), and Vacuum of Technotronic. At its peak, rootkit.com had 81,000 users.
Rootkit.com was compromised in 2011 via Social engineering (security) as part of the LulzSec attack by Hector Xavier Monsegur (aka Sabu) and the user database was leaked. The leaked user database was then used for research against the Chinese Government-sponsored hacking group commonly known as 'APT1'. The rootkit.com site since remains offline.
Physical Memory Forensics.
Hoglund was an early pioneer in the research and development of physical memory forensics, now considered standard practice in computer forensics in law enforcement. He saw the physical memory as a complex snapshot of interrelated structures and data arrays, instead of just a flatfile full of strings. The original application was not forensics, but rootkit detection and process hiding - showing how physical memory forensics grew partly from rootkit development. With the release of HBGary's product "Responder" in 2008, Hoglund was one of the first to deliver OS reconstruction to the market, pivotal in the use of physical memory to reconstruct software and user behavior. "Responder PRO" continues to be a staple tool for law enforcement and incident response today.

Gene Fekete

Eugene H. "Gene" Fekete (August 31, 1922 – April 28, 2011) was an American football fullback and linebacker who played for the Cleveland Browns for one season in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) before launching a coaching and education career.
Fekete was from Findlay, Ohio, where he starred on several high school sports teams. He graduated and enrolled at Ohio State University in 1941. At Ohio State, he was part of a football team that won the school's first national championship in 1942. After serving in the U.S. Army for several years during World War II, Fekete returned to Ohio State to finish his education and played one year for the Browns, a new professional football team in the AAFC.
His career cut short by a bad knee, Fekete went on to serve as an assistant football coach at Ohio State for 10 years. He then got a degree in educational administration and was the principal of two high schools and two middle schools in Columbus, Ohio before he retired in 1975. He was inducted into Ohio State's Varsity "O" Hall of Fame in 1998. Fekete died in 2011.
Early life and high school career.
Fekete was born to Hungarian immigrants who settled in Findlay, Ohio in the early 1900s. Like his brothers John and Frank, he played on the Findlay High School basketball, track and football teams. A standout athlete, he was recruited by several big-name college football programs, including Michigan State University, Notre Dame University and Ohio State University. He accepted Ohio State's offer.
College and military career.
Fekete played on Ohio State's freshman team in 1941, and moved to the varsity team under coach Paul Brown the following year. As a sophomore in 1942, Fekete scored two touchdowns in the team's first regular-season game, a 59–0 win over a Fort Knox military team. He scored another pair of touchdowns in Ohio State's second game, a 32–21 win over Indiana University. In a game against the University of Pittsburgh, he set an Ohio State record for the longest run from scrimmage, an 89-yard dash to the end zone. The record still stands. While Fekete's run was not recorded as a touchdown in Ohio State's record-books, a YouTube video shows him running into the end zone.
Fekete led the Big Ten Conference in scoring and rushing in 1942 as Ohio State amassed a 9–1 record and won its first-ever national title. Fekete was selected as a third-team All-American and was on the second team of United Press's all-Big-Ten team. Fekete also was eighth in the Heisman Trophy voting, making him the first Ohio State player to finish in the top ten.
Fekete joined the U.S. Army in 1943 and was sent to Fort Bragg in North Carolina. After a stint at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York to train as an engineer, he was sent to a recruitment center in Manhattan as an assistant psychologist. Fekete competed in the annual College All-Star Game in 1944 despite not having played football or exercised regularly for a year. He was out of shape and reported late to practice because the army initially denied his request to participate. On a handoff from quarterback Otto Graham in the team's first practice, he snapped ligaments in his left knee. After his discharge from the military, Fekete returned to Ohio State to finish out a master's degree in physical education. His thesis was a manual for the U.S. Air Force's conditioning program.
Professional career.
After about a year of recuperation, Fekete's knee was strong enough for him to play football again. He was selected by the Detroit Lions in the sixth round of the 1945 NFL Draft. He signed instead with the Cleveland Browns, a team set to start play in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1946. The Browns were coached by Paul Brown, his old coach at Ohio State.
During the 1946 season, Fekete shared time at fullback with Marion Motley. His knee injury flared up again, however, and it became clear that it could not sustain the hard knocks of a professional football season. He ended his playing career and got married after the Browns won the AAFC championship in 1946, for which Fekete received an $833 bonus.
Coaching career.
After ending his playing career, Fekete accepted a job as the coach of Northern Illinois University's football team. After two years in that job, he returned to Ohio State as an assistant coach under Wes Fesler in 1949. Woody Hayes took over as Ohio State's head coach in 1951, and Fekete remained on the staff until 1958. He coached running backs including Heisman Trophy winners Vic Janowicz and Howard "Hopalong" Cassady. Ohio State won two national championships while Fekete was with the team, in 1954 and 1957.
Education career.
Frustrated at not getting a head coaching job in the college ranks and wanting to spend more time with his family and two sons, Fekete left his Ohio State coaching job. He tried the insurance business,then became the coach of the Columbus team in the new minor-league United Football League (1961-1964),in 1961, but resigned the following year. He spent four years as a World History teacher and football coach at West High School in Columbus, Ohio. The 1965 Occident Yearbook p.88 states that Fekete "left after the first semester to become a cadet principal". He then moved on to North High School in Columbus as an assistant principal, followed by Franklin and Starling middle schools before serving as principal of Briggs High School for 13 years.
Later life and death.
Fekete retired from Briggs in 1975 and was elected to the Ohio State Men's Varsity "O" Hall of Fame in 1998. He died in 2011 at Riverside Methodist Hospital in Columbus.

<doc id="19365913" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19365913" title="Scientific terminology">
Scientific terminology

While studying nature, scientists often encounter or create new material or immaterial objects and concepts and are compelled to name them. Most of those names are known only to professionals. However, due to popularization of science, they gradually become part of common languages. Several categories of scientific terminology can be distinguished.
New concepts.
Those are specific notions and terms, e.g.,
New materials.
The increasing focus of science on technological applications results in extensive search for new materials having unusual or superior properties. Their names can be categorized into new substances (nanotubes, etc.) and registered trademarks and brand names, such as Teflon. Trademarks and brand names are vast fields on their own and are not covered in this article.
New techniques and devices.
Unlike laser and SQUID, many names of the new devices and techniques are commonly used in full spelling, e.g., scanning tunneling microscope, etc. Some devices like transistor, magnetron, etc., have integrated into our life so much that their names are no longer considered terminology and are rather neologisms.
Alternative meaning of common words.
SIESTA, SQUID and SHRIMP are acronyms distinguished from siesta, squid and shrimp by capitalization. However, there are pairs of scientific terminology and common words, which can only be distinguished by context. Representative examples come from particle physics where certain properties of particles are called flavour, color, but have no relation to conventional flavor and color. Another famous example is frustration used to describe ground state properties in condensed matter physics, and especially in magnetic systems.
Composite words.
Recent scientific activity often creates interdisciplinary fields, for which new names, classified into portmanteau words or syllabic abbreviations, are often created by combining two or more words, sometimes with extra prefixes and suffixes. Examples of those – biotechnology, nanotechnology, etc. – are well known and understood, at least superficially, by most non-scientists.
Elementary particles, quasiparticles and chemical elements.
Progress of particle physics, nuclear physics and atomic physics has resulted in discoveries of new elementary particles and atoms. Their names – quark, gluon, lepton, graviton, neutrino, Higgs boson, Mendelevium, etc. – are traditionally given by those people who first discovered them and often include surnames of classical scientists.
Another group of physics terminology terms, exciton, magnon, phonon, plasmon, phason, polaron, roton etc., refers to quasiparticles – quanta of corresponding excitations (spin, heat, plasma, polarization waves), which do not exist separately and were imagined by theoretists to consistently describe properties of solids and liquids.
Most relevant terminology can be found in the following Wikipedia articles and their links
Classical and non-vernacular terms and expressions.
In modern science and its applied fields such as technology and medicine, a knowledge of Classical languages is not as rigid a prerequisite as it used to be. However, traces of their influence remain. Firstly, languages such as Greek, Latin and Arabic, either directly or via more recently derived languages such as French, have provided not only most of the technical terms used in Western science, but also a "de facto" vocabulary of roots, prefixes and suffixes for the construction of new terms as required. Echoes of the consequences sound in remarks such as "Television? The word is half Latin and half Greek. No good can come of it."
A special class of terminology that overwhelmingly is derived from classical sources, is biological classification, in which binomial nomenclature still is most often based on classical origins. The derivations are arbitrary however and can be mixed variously with modernisms, late Latin, and even fictional roots, errors and whims. However, in spite of the chaotic nature of the field, it still is helpful to the biologist to have a good vocabulary of classical roots.
Branches of science that are based, however tenuously, on fields of study known to the ancients, or that were established by more recent workers familiar with Greek and Latin, often use terminology that is fairly correct descriptive Latin, or occasionally Greek. Descriptive human anatomy or works on biological morphology often use such terms, for example, Musculus gluteus maximus simply means the "largest rump muscle". (Musculus was the Latin for "little mouse", which was the name they applied to muscles.) During the last two centuries there has been an increasing tendency to modernise the terminology, though how beneficial that might be is subject to discussion. In other descriptive anatomical terms, whether in vertebrates or invertebrates, a frenum, a structure for keeping something in place, is simply the Latin for a bridle, and a foramen, a passage or perforation also is the actual Latin word.
All such words are so much terminology. It does not much matter whether modern users know that they are classical or not. Some distinct term is necessary for any meaningful concept, and if it is not classical, a modern coinage would not generally be any more comprehensible (consider examples such as "byte" or "dongle"). Another modern use of classical language however, is the subject of often acrimonious debate. It is the use of foreign or classical (commonly Latin) expressions terms, or "tags", where it would be possible to use the vernacular instead. This is common in everyday speech in some circles, saying "Requiescat in pace" instead of "Rest in peace" might be pretension or pleasantry, but in law and science among other fields, there are many Latin expressions in use, where it might be equally practical to use the vernacular. Consider the following discussion of the Latin term ""sensu"".
Latin, its current relevance or convenience.
There is no definite limit to how sophisticated a level of Latin may be brought to bear in conventional scientific terminology; such convention dates back to the days when nearly all standard communications in such subjects were written in Latin as an international scientific lingua franca. That was not so long ago; from the latter days of the Roman empire Classical Latin had become the dominant language in learned, civil, diplomatic, legal, and religious communication in many states in Europe. Even after Latin had lost its status as a vernacular, Medieval or Late Latin increasingly became the "de facto lingua franca" in educated circles during the establishment of the Holy Roman Empire. The peak of the dominance of Latin in such contexts probably was during the Renaissance, but the language only began to lose favour for such purposes in the eighteenth century, and gradually at that. The presence of Latin terms in modern writing is largely the residue of the terminology of old documents.
The expression of fine distinctions in academically correct Latin technical terminology may well help in conveying intended meanings more flexibly and concisely, but the significance of the language need not always be taken seriously. An inspection of any collection of references will produce a range of very variable and dubious usages, and often a great deal of obsessive dispute. In contrast, the authoritative glossary attached to the textbook on "Biological Nomenclature" produced by the "Systematics Association" displays a very dismissive attitude to the question; for example, the only relevant entries it presents on the subject of the term "sensu" are:
Such entries suggest that the Systematics Association is not concerned with hair-splitting in the use of the Latin terms.
In informal or non-technical English,to say: "strictly speaking" for "Sensu stricto" and "broadly speaking" for "sensu lato" and so on is valid. Even in formal writing there is no formal requirement to use the Latin terms rather than the vernacular.
Valid reasons for using these Latin or partly Latin expressions are not points of pretentiousness; they include:
Acronyms.
A good example is word laser. Laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation, and therefore all its letters should be capitalized. However, because of frequent use, this acronym became a neologism, i.e., it has integrated into English and most other languages. Consequently, laser is commonly written in small letters. It has even produced secondary acronyms such as LASIK (Laser-ASsisted in Situ Keratomileusis). A related acronym and neologism maser (Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is much less known. Nevertheless, it is commonly written in small letters. On the contrary, acronym SPASER (Surface Plasmon Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is capitalized.
Many scientific acronyms or abbreviations reflect the artistic sense of their creators, e.g.,
etc. (see also List of astronomy acronyms).

Prostitution in North Korea

Prostitution in North Korea is illegal, and according to the North Korean government does not exist, but it is still practiced discreetly.
State prostitution.
The North Korean government engages in forced prostitution. Its prostitutes are known as "manjokcho" ( "satisfaction team(s)") and are organised as a part of the "kippŭmjo", who are drafted from among 14 to 20 year old virgins, trained for about 20 months, and often "ordered to marry guards of [Kim Jong-il] or national heroes" when they are 25 years old. For a girl selected to serve in the "kippŭmjo", it is impossible to refuse, even if she is the daughter of a party official. "Manjokcho" must have sex with male high-ranking party officials. Their services are not available to most North Korean men. Not all "kippŭmjo" work as prostitutes—the source used is unclear as to whether only adult women are assigned to prostitution, or whether there is prostitution of children; other "kippŭmjo" activities are massaging and half-naked singing and dancing.
Chinese prostitution in North Korea.
Many Chinese women, of Joseonjok descent are working as prostitutes in the Kumgangsan Tourist Region of North Korea. These repatriated women’s clients in North Korea are often South Korean men who are travelers.
Female defectors in Northern China.
North Korean women are increasingly falling victim to sex exploitation in China attempting to escape poverty and harsh conditions in their homeland. Nearly 10,000 women are reported to have escaped from North Korea to China; many of them are forced into sexual slavery according to human rights groups.
According to a source from 2005, "60 to 70 percent of North Korean defectors in the People’s Republic of China are women, 70 to 80 percent of whom are victims of human trafficking."
Violent abuse starts in apartments near the border, from where the women are then moved to cities further away to work as sex slaves. When Chinese authorities arrest these North Korean slaves, they repatriate them. North Korean authorities keep such repatriates in penal labour colonies (and/or execute them), execute any Chinese-fathered babies of theirs "to protect North Korean pure blood" and force abortions on all pregnant repatriates not executed.

Haflong Hindi

Haflong Hindi () is the lingua franca of Dima Hasao district of Assam state of India. It is a creole language that stemmed from Hindi and included vocabulary from several other languages, such as Bengali, Assamese, Dimasa and the Zeme Naga dialect. It is named after Haflong, which is the headquarters of Dima Hasao district.
Example Phrases.
The dialect is largely intelligible to Hindi speakers, and features simplified grammar with loanword infusions.
In contrast to printed forms of Hindi, the Haflong variety lacks person and number agreement in the verb and ergative marking of the subject when transitive clauses are in a preterite or perfect tense.
Creole language.
Many pidgin dialects remain confined to that status, being used largely for trade purposes. When a dialect broadens and becomes a native vernacular and achieves strong adoption and stability, it is technically a language. Tok Pisin (an official language of Papua New Guinea) and Seselwa (an official language of the Seychelles) have achieved that status. Haflong Hindi demonstrates these signs of standardization and wide adoption. For instance, All India Radio employs it for broadcasts in Dima Hasao, and Hindi speakers (including government officials) in the region are expected to learn Haflong Hindi. Therefore, Haflong Hindi is more correctly classified as a creole language rather than a pidgin.
