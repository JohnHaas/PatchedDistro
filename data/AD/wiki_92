Ta' Ħaġrat temple

The Ta' Ħaġrat temples in Mġarr, Malta is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with several other Megalithic temples. They are amongst the most ancient religious sites on Earth. The larger Ta' Ħaġrat temple dates from the Ġgantija phase (3600–3200 BCE); the smaller is dated to the Saflieni phase (3300–3000 BCE).
Location.
Ta' Ħaġrat is on the eastern outskirts of the village of Mġarr, roughly one kilometer from the Ta' Skorba temples. Characteristics of the Ta' Ħaġrat façade resemble those in the Ta' Skorba complex.
Temple Complex.
The excavation of plentiful pottery deposits show that a village stood on the site and predates the temples themselves. This early pottery is dated to the Mġarr phase (3800-3600 BCE).
Ta' Ħaġrat is built out of lower coralline limestone, the oldest exposed rock in the Maltese Islands. The complex contains two adjacent temples. The smaller temple abuts the major one on the northern side.
The two parts are less regularly planned and smaller in size than many of the other neolithic temples in Malta. Unlike other megalithic temples in Malta no decorated blocks were discovered; however a number of artifacts were found. Perhaps most intriguing is a scale model of a temple, sculpted in globigerina limestone.
The model is roofed and shows the typical structure of a Maltese temple including a trilithon façade, narrow-broad walling technique and upper layers of horizontal corbelling.
Major Temple.
The Ġgantija phase temple is typically trefoil, with a concave façade opening onto a spacious semicircular forecourt. The façade contains a monumental doorway in the center and a bench at its base. Two steps lead up to the main entrance and a corridor flanked by upright megaliths of coralline limestone.
The corridor leads into a central torba court, radiating three semi-circular chambers. These were partially walled off at some time in the Saflieni phase; pottery shards were recovered from the internal packing of this wall. The apses are constructed with roughly-hewn stone walls and have a rock floor. Corbelling visible on the walls of the apses suggest that the temple was roofed.
A small sculptured temple was discovered here.
Minor Temple.
The Saflieni phase temple rests to the north and is six and a half meters long. It is entered through the eastern apse of the larger temple. Smaller stones have been used in its construction and it exhibits irregularities in design considered archaic or provincial.
Excavation.
The site was excavated between 1923 and 1926 by Sir Temi Zammit, then Director of Museums. British archaeologist David Trump accurately dated the complex in the 1960s.
Restoration.
Parts of the façade and doorway were reconstructed in 1937.

Ludwig Karl von Kalckstein

Ludwig Karl von Kalckstein (10 March 1725 – 12 October 1800) was a Prussian count and field marshal.
Kalckstein was born in Berlin to Christoph Wilhelm von Kalckstein, laird of Knauten, Wogau and Graventhien near Mühlhausen in East Prussia, and Christophore Erna von Brandt. He became an officer in the Prussian Army and served in Prince Henry of Prussia's regiment, which led to a close relationship between Kalckstein and the Prince. In 1778 he was retired as a Major General by Frederick II of Prussia and returned to his family's manor in East Prussia. After the death of Frederick II he was reenacted by Frederick William II of Prussia in 1786. In 1790 he received the Order of the Black Eagle and in 1796 he was promoted to a Generalfeldmarschall. Kalckstein became the Governor of the Fortress Magdeburg, where he died and was buried.

<doc id="19383976" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19383976" title="Reno Aces">
Reno Aces

The Reno Aces are a minor league baseball franchise based in Reno, Nevada, in the United States. The team is a member of the Pacific Coast League and is the Triple-A affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
The franchise is owned by SK Baseball, LLC and is a part of the Pacific Conference's North Division along with the Tacoma Rainiers, Salt Lake Bees, and Colorado Springs Sky Sox. The Aces began their inaugural season on the road on April 10, 2009, and played their home opener in the new Aces Ballpark on April 17, 2009.
History.
Team origins.
The Aces were originally known as the Tucson Sidewinders from 1998 to 2008. Before that, the team was first known as the Tucson Toros. They were Tucson's Triple-A baseball club, playing at Hi Corbett Field in midtown Tucson from 1969 to 1997. Part of the old 10-team configuration of the Pacific Coast League, the Toros won the PCL Championship in 1991 and 1993. The Toros were preceded by a number of other Tucson teams between 1915 and 1958, such as the Tucson Cowboys and the Tucson Lizards.
After the MLB expansion that added the Arizona Diamondbacks in Phoenix and Tampa Bay Devil Rays, the Toros moved to Fresno, California, as the Fresno Grizzlies. The Phoenix Firebirds relocated to Tucson, briefly became the Tucson Toros (1997), and then became the Sidewinders (1998), the Triple-A affiliate of the new Diamondbacks. This was accomplished by what amounted to a "swap" in ownership in 1997, with Firebirds owner Martin Stone purchasing the Toros and Toros owner Rick Holtzman receiving interest in the Firebirds. The Tucson team retained management and staff primarily from the Toros, and traces its history from the Toros rather than the Firebirds.
The Phoenix Firebirds had played from 1958 through 1997 as an affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. The franchise joined the Pacific Coast League as a charter member in 1903 as the San Francisco Seals, relocating to Phoenix when the major league New York Giants moved to San Francisco. Seals alumni include Joe DiMaggio. 
The Tucson Toros have been affiliated with the Chicago White Sox (1969–1972), the Oakland Athletics (1973–1976), the Texas Rangers (1977–1979), the Houston Astros (1980–1996), and the Milwaukee Brewers (1997 only, with one Diamondbacks prospect, Travis Lee, playing with them by special arrangement). At the time of the change in venue and affiliations (1998), a new Tucson team name, the "Sidewinders" was chosen after a name the team contest was held.
The Toros have since become a member of the independent Golden Baseball League, adopting their previous Triple-A history from 1969 to 1997.
A new era – Reno Aces.
In late 2007, it was formally announced that the Sidewinders would be moving to Reno, Nevada, after the 2008 season. A new 9,100-capacity venue, Aces Ballpark, was constructed for the team in downtown Reno. 
The move forced the Reno Silver Sox of the independent Golden Baseball League to fold. The franchise dropped the name "Sidewinders" in place of a new identity. Some fans suggested that the team should adopt or purchase the rights to the Silver Sox name from the GBL for the new PCL club, but that was ruled out as that team was, at that point (prior to folding), likely to relocate to Carson City, Nevada. The Reno Aces introduced their new team name and logo at a press conference on September 23, 2008. The nickname has a dual meaning: "ace" is a baseball slang term for a team's top pitcher, and the ace is the highest card in several card games (a reference to Nevada's legalized gambling history).
The Reno Aces were due to begin their inaugural season on Thursday, April 9, 2009, on the road against the Salt Lake Bees. However, the game was postponed due to the death of Anaheim Angels' Nick Adenhart (a Salt Lake alumnus), who was killed by a hit-and-run driver earlier in the day. Adenhart had played for the Bees during the 2008 season, and was remembered the next day in what was originally the second game in a four game series between the Aces and the Bees. The Bees beat the Aces 6–2 on Friday, April 10, 2009. The Aces won their home opener at Aces Ballpark on Friday, April 17, 2009, 11–1 against the Salt Lake Bees, to an over-capacity sell-out crowd of 9,167.
The Aces would make the playoffs for the first time in their history in 2011 failing to make it past the first round after losing the series to the Sacramento River Cats. The Aces made it to the playoffs the next season, eventually winning the 2012 Pacific Coast League title and the Triple-A National Championship Game against the Pawtucket Red Sox.
The Reno Aces Baseball Club hosted the nationally televised 2013 Triple-A All-Star Game on Wednesday, July 17, 2013.

Davide Sorrenti

Davide Sorrenti (July 9, 1976 Naples, Italy – February 4, 1997 New York, USA) was a fashion photographer, son of photographer and advertiser Francesca Sorrenti; and brother of Mario Sorrenti (b. 1971), and Vanina Sorrenti (b. 1973) also fashion photographers.
Biography.
Rise to fame.
Davide Sorrenti was born 1976 in Naples, Italy, in a family of talented photographers (unofficially they have become known as "the Corleones" of fashion photography); his mother Francesca Sorrenti, renowned fashion photographer, as well as his five year older brother Mario; and his sister Vanina, (after his death) also proved to be a talented photographer.
The Sorrentis moved to New York in the early 1980s, partly because Davide had thalassemia (or "Cooley's anemia", a hereditary form of anemia), and needed regular blood transfusions and medical care; a burden that is believed to at least partially have caused him to take comfort in drugs. The disease made him look several years younger than his real age. His brother Mario documented his sufferings one of many nights, published in the book "The machine"; referring to the drug infusion pump that Davide was hooked up to.
Growing up in a cultivated environment, Davide painted, played golf and liked opera, but he soon also became a “prep-school gangster”; private-school students living a wannabee gangster’s life, with shoplifting, credit-card scams and drug dealing as a way of gaining status. He also started the crew SKE, with fellow skateboarders and graffiti artists (Davide’s tag was "Argue"); with whom he formed a rap group called "the Mosaics", because of their wide mix of ethnicities; and started the streetwear label Danücht. 
Davide began documenting his friends in their everyday actions at the age of 18, developing his own distinctive personal style and sense of fashion. Around age 19, his darkly glamorous photos appeared in magazines like "Interview", "Detour", and "Ray Gun". With his talent, charm, and juvenile good looks, he quickly became New York’s fashion Wunderkind, boosting the "heroin chic"-trend with young skinny waif-models appearing as drug addicts. A promising member of Generation X, Sorrenti was known for his photographs of seemingly strung-out models in stupor-like poses that, some felt, emulated the blank look of the heroin addict and glamorized drug use. Based on reports from the BBC’s Online, Sorrenti fell in love with teenage model Jaime (James) King, herself a heroin addict, and Sorrenti quickly stepped into the void of substance abuse. Vulnerable due to his thalassemia, and a lethal injection of a quantity “not normally considered unusual,” Sorrenti was dead within six months.
Heroin Chic.
Inspired by the real-life subjects of the photojournalism of Larry Clark in the 1960s and Nan Goldin in the 1970s, photographers like Juergen Teller, Craig McDean, David Sims and Terry Richardson reacted against the “phony and over-retouched” aesthetics of 1980s glamour, introducing what they thought were a more truthful approach to reality in the early 1990s. Having started as an underground trend, the approach soon went mainstream when more commercial photographers started copying the style, and with the long running campaign of Calvin Klein featuring models like Kate Moss and Vincent Gallo.
Davide’s career started almost as soon as he learned how to handle a camera in 1994. His mother Francesca recalls that every day was a photo shoot for Davide. He documented everything he and his friends did, making them feel that something big was about to happen. In a series of snapshots published in "Interview" 1996, his friends from SKE are portrayed hanging out in a run-down apartment, watching TV and smoking pot. His photos also got published in magazines like Detour, Surface, Ray Gun and i-D, all of them proponents of heroin chic, and shot campaign photos for the Japanese fashion companies Hysteric Glamour and Matsuda.
Davide’s girlfriend at the time, fashion model Jamie (a.k.a. James) King, had been the subject of a cover story in The New York Times Magazine, where she admitted getting involved in drugs when she started modelling at age 14. One of Davide’s photos shows a young, skinny Jamie lying on a bed, with torn clothes surrounded with photos of famous drug casualties like Kurt Cobain, Sid Vicious, and Jerry Garcia of Grateful Dead.
Death and aftermath.
On February 4, 1997, Davide died of a kidney ailment, possibly caused by a combination of his illness and his excessive heroin use at his friend’s apartment in Manhattan, although autopsies were incomplete. 
As a reaction to her son’s death, Francesca Sorrenti started a campaign against the glamourization of drug addiction and underage models, demanding magazine editors to take responsibility. “Heroin chic isn't what we're projecting. It's what we are. Our business has become heroin chic. Someone taking pictures of that magnitude has to have experienced hard drugs”, Ms. Sorrenti stated in The New York Times.
Matt Jones, photographer and son of i-D editor Terry Jones, said of his friend Davide: “I guess he did slightly see the glamorous side. He also saw the real side of it. And he glamorized it himself, which is the sad thing. It was a whole circle. He glamorized it, and got caught up in it a bit.”
In May 1997, President Clinton denounced the American fashion industry for cynically abusing teenagers and helping spread heroin usage to a new and younger group of people. “Some fashion leaders are admitting flat-out that images projected in fashion photos in the last few years have made heroin addiction seem glamorous and sexy and cool," President Clinton stated. “And as some of the people in those images start to die now, it's become obvious that is not true. The glorification of heroin is not creative, it's destructive. It's not beautiful, it is ugly. And this is not about art, it's about life and death. And glorifying death is not good for any society."
Davide Sorrenti’s death caused the fashion industry to declare heroin chic improper and passé, and by summer 1997 a new healthy look was introduced on its magazine spreads. Jamie King went to rehabilitation the following year for her addictions to heroin and alcohol.

Orr Eravuu

Orr Eravuu (; ) is a 2010 Tamil independent horror film directed by 3 debutants, Hari Shankar, Hareesh Narayan and Krishna Sekhar. The film talks seemingly outside normal sensory channels, termed as Paranormal - something believed to have no accordance with scientific laws. Spirits and Ghosts are believed to have a close kinship with Night. Based on this concept "Orr Eravuu" was made. The entire film was shot from the protagonist's viewpoint, using shaky camerawork, reportedly the first Indian viewpoint film.
Plot.
Nakulan Ponnusamy, a paranormal investigator and proprietor of Silver Chord Services, travels from Chennai to Munnar where he goes to solve a case of a house believed to be haunted, belonging to a businessman Anand Chandrasekar. Nakul spends one full night in the haunted house and conducts his sophisticated paranormal investigation. Meanwhile, Nakul finds that three other investigators belonging to Seventh Sense Para-psychology team also had come to the house for investigation. After some horrible sequences and mysterious circumstances, Nakul is found dead in the house. Daisy, a reporter in a Television Program Metro Crimes analyzes Nakul's death.
Production.
"Orr Eravuu" was produced by one of the directors Hari Shankar under the banner Shankar Bros; it was the studio's first film project. The film was initially titled as "Eraaa", before it was renamed.
The crew had been involved in the study of paranormal procedures, been working on field with Ouija board (wee-gee board), electronic voice phenomenon, EMF meters, micro cassette recorder and much more scientific instruments. Also they involved at night shoots in the locations which were broadly believed to be haunted. Notably, all technicians who worked in this venture were newcomers.
Sathish. G played the lead role and handled the cinematography as well, shooting in Point-of-View and using shaky camerawork. Sathish. G had designed his own rig to fix the camera at the level of human's eye and shot the whole film, assembling the rig on his head with the Sony HD Camera. With this camera setup, he walks, drives, climbs, runs, performs all the paranormal tests and takes the audience into the scene. Since the film was made in digital, Hari Shankar decided to have a sophisticated Edit Setup and preferred to use the Apple Systems. The entire film was edited in Apple Final Cut Pro with the true HD resolution 1080p. The sound was recorded live to make the audience feel the real ambience of the scene. The DTS sound was mixed in the A. M. Studios by Shiva Kumar and Kannan.
Music.
The music was scored by K. Venkat Prabu Shankar. Although, the film was planned to be released without any film score and only a theme music at the end credits, the crew decided that to include a score to elevate the tension. The theme of the score is based on 3 states of matter; solitariness, seeking and terror. The music was scored giving high priority to silence, live sound and the visuals. The film features one song that was supposedly penned by the spirit of legendary poet Kannadasan, through a medium, C. M. Rathnasamy, who has vast experience in this field of spirit interaction for nearly 30 years. The song was composed and performed by Sathish Kumar. The song includes the narration of the classic Tamil play "Harichandra" in which the lead character lives as a grave digger, describing the practice of funeral according to the good or bad life of the dead.
The soundtrack consists of three songs.
Reception.
"Orr Eravuu" released to mixed critical response. Rediff's Pavithra Srinivasan gave the film 3 out of 5, citing that it was "definitely worth a watch". Malathai Rangaraja from "The Hindu" wrote: "The premise is interesting, the narration is new, the genre is fresh and the effort to be different is evident. Yet if the subject fails to keep the viewer glued to his seat, it's probably because the technical team is a let-down!" Bhama Devi Ravi from "The Times of India" gave the film 1.5 out of 5 and said: "...all the feverish excitement is lost when the film stays confined to the documentary feel [...] There are too many loopholes in the story [...] You come out feeling cheated of goosebumps". A Behindwoods.com reviewer gave it 2.5 out of 5, describing the film as "successfully scary".
Awards.
"Orr Eravuu" won the Best Tamil Independent Film Award at the 2010 Chennai International Film Festival.

Neelakantan Nambisan

Kalamandalam Neelakantan Nambisan (1919–85) was a trend-setter Kathakali musician who played a crucial role in remoulding the aesthetics of singing for the classical dance-drama of Kerala, south India. Nambisan imbibed a set of fresh musical ideas from his epoch-making guru Mundaya Venkitakrishna Bhagavatar, developed them to sound even better and handed them over to a set of disciples, most of whom gained name and fame sooner or later.
Nambisan's weighty yet part-nasal music, which marked a quantum transition of Kathakali songs from its original Sopanam base to more of the Carnatic style, had such cascading effect on Kathakali music that it has since sounded radically different by becoming more ornate, sophisticated and bhava-oriented than ever. His prominent disciples at the Kerala Kalamandalam include virtually the who is who of the Kathakali music of the Kalluvazhi style: Kalamandalam Unnikrishna Kurup, Kalamandalam Gangadharan, Ramankutty Varrier, Madambi Subramanian Namboodiri, Tirur Nambissan Kalamandalam Sankaran Embranthiri, Kalamandalam Hyderali, Kalamandalam Haridas, Kalamandalam Subramanian, Kalamandalam P.G. Radhakrishnan, Kalanilayam Unnikrishnan and Kalamandalam Bhavadasan, Kalamandalam Gopalakrishnan.
Nambisan was born in Kothachira village of Palakkad district on November 2, 1919. After completing primary schooling, he received training in singing Ashtapadis in the Sopanam style. He had also learnt Ottamthullal from his elder brother Parameswaran Nambisan and maddalam from Vellattanhur Raman Nambisan. Later, on joining Kerala Kalamandalam as a teenager, Nambisan was initiated into Kathakali singing by veterans Samikutty Bhagavatar and Kuttan Bhagavatar. He also learnt the basics of Carnatic music from Kakkat Karanavappadu. Soon his qualities like dense voice, adherence to the pitch, emotive rendition and sense of rhythm found grooming under the tutelage of Venkitakrishna Bhagavatar. He soon mastered anchoring the music part of storyplays—be them the choreographically intricate type or ones meriting melodramatic rendition. Nambisan also parallelly received bits of training in Sanskrit, Hindi and English. He also took classes from nadaswaram player Govinda Swamy.
As a teacher, he joined Kerala Kalamandalam in 1946 and retired from his alma mater as its principal. He later served as a tutor in PSV Natyasangham, Kottakkal, as well.

Niki Kunchev

Nikolay "Niki" Kunchev () (born December 26, 1960) is a Bulgarian television host, famous for hosting the Bulgarian version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" (re-titled to "Стани богат" ("Become Rich"), since the award from the start was 100,000 leva, instead of a million). After he became popular with the show, he was selected as a co-host of "Big Brother Bulgaria" on the same television channel, Nova Television. Later on, he also hosted the game show "1 vs. 100" (known in Bulgaria as "One versus All" ("Един срещу всички")), which made him one of the most frequently appearing hosts on the channel. In late 2008, it was not known whether he would return to host a show on Nova TV, after the producer Nikola Tuparev, a friend of Kunchev, had left SIA Advertising, the company that produced Niki Kunchev's pre-2008 shows together with Nova TV. However, in January 2009 "Стани богат" returned to Nova TV, but as expected it was produced by Nikola Tuparev's new production company Oldschool Productions.

Rhine Orange

Rheinorange (Rhine Orange) is the name of a sculpture erected in Duisburg-Neuenkamp in 1992 at the point where the Ruhr flows into the Rhine at 'Rheinkilometer 780', i.e. 780 km from the source of the Rhine. It was constructed from steel by the sculptor Lutz Fritsch from Köln.
It is 25 m tall, 7 m wide and 1 m thick, and weights 83 tonnes. The cost was over 400.000 DM, which was donated by IHK Niederrhein after an initiative by employees. The name "Rheinorange" is actually a play on words. It sounds like "Reinorange" (pure orange) which is RAL 2004 in the RAL color standard.
The sculpture is intended to form a landmark. The mouth of the river, the largest inland harbour in Europe, the most important steel district in Europe, a base for technology with a future, the Lehmbruck-Museum as an important gallery for modern sculpture in Europe, are all intended to be connected with each other in representing aspects of the economic and cultural life of Duisburg.
The Rhine Orange is a feature on the Industrial Heritage Route.

Tierra de Léon is a Spanish Denominación de Origen (DO) for wines located in the south of the province of Léon, in Castile-Leon region, Spain, and covers an area of 3,317 km2 at an altitude of approximately 900 m above sea level. The area attained its D.O. status on 27 July 2007.
History.
Grape cultivation was probably introduced by the ancient Romans. The area benefited from being at the crossroads of two important routes: The Way of Saint James, the pilgrimage route running east to west from France to Santiago de Compostela, and the Ruta de la Plata, running north–south between the silver mines of the Cantabrian coast and the southern port of Cadiz.
Around the 10th century, the main economic activities of the region were cereal production and milling, along with grape growing and winemaking, which was practiced in the monasteries of different religious orders. Production increased steadily over the centuries until 1887 which is when the phylloxera virus destroyed most of the vineyards of the area. Production did not pick up again until the 1920s.
In 1985, a group of producers applied for DO status based on the promotion of the local autochthonous grape variety known as Prieto Picudo.
Climate.
The area has a continental climate (long, hot dry summers; cold winters). Temperatures in winter often fall below 0°C and there is frequent frosts and fog.
Soils.

Nursery Crimes (band)

Nursery Crimes were a hardcore band from Melbourne. They formed in early 1989 by Phil Rose on lead vocals. They played both locally and around Australia before disbanding in 1994. They released two full length albums, some singles and extended plays. Their debut releases were "All Torn up Inside" (1989 single), "No Time for That Crime" (1990 extended play, on pink bubblegum vinyl) and "Fun Hurts!" (May 1992, studio album). They were early pioneers and supporters of "all-ages", no-alcohol gigs, to allow a wider and younger audience to experience live music. Nursery Crimes were a support act on Australian tours by L7, Henry Rollins, Faith No More, Fugazi and All. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described how Nursery Crimes' "sound was built around melodic yet crunching guitar riffs, frenetic arrangements, rapid fire lead vocals and sweet harmonies". The group reunited for a series of gigs in 2006.
History.
Nursery Crimes formed in Melbourne in early 1989 by Paddy Chong on bass guitar; Dave Dixon on guitar and backing vocals; Caine Knight on lead guitar; Russell Hopkinson on drums (ex-Vicious Circle, Bamboos, Kryptonics, Cremator); and Phil Rose (aka Richard Andrew Rose) on lead vocals (ex-Slush Puppies). Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described how their "sound was built around melodic yet crunching guitar riffs, frenetic arrangements, rapid fire lead vocals and sweet harmonies".
Their debut single, "All Torn up Inside", was issued on Au Go Go Records late in the following year, together with their extended play, "No Time for That Crime". Chong left the group to join Girl Monstar and then The Fuck Fucks, he was replaced on bass guitar by Davarj Thomas, who also provided backing vocals.
Nursery Crimes left Au Go Go and joined Survival Records, and in 1990 they released another EP, "Marked by Time", which was produced by Kaj Dahlstrom. For the European market, the group provided a compilation album, "What Do You Know (Anyway)?" on Normal Records. In April 1991 they issued their second single, "Eleanor Rigby", a cover version of The Beatles' 1966 song. Knight was replaced on lead guitar by James Masson, who added piano.
The group's debut studio album, "Fun Hurts!", appeared in May 1992. It was co-produced by the band and Dahlstrom. McFarlane described it as "amphetamine-charged". By the end of that year Masson was replaced on guitar by James McInnes, and Chris Latham replaced Hopkinson on drums who joined You Am I.
In August 1993 the group released another EP, "Something's Wrong with Our Heroes", and undertook a national tour to support it. Early the following year Nursery Crimes disbanded. During their career Nursery Crimes were a support act on Australian tours by L7, Henry Rollins, Faith No More, Fugazi and All. Thomas later joined pre.shrunk (1996–2003). In 1994 McInnes and Rose formed Shreen, McFarlane compared the two groups "Like Nursery Crimes, Shreen's sound combined melodic pop hooks, incisive guitar riffs, tight harmonies and rapid tempos". Dixon later joined the same group, which disbanded in 1996.
Rose has co-written material for Bodyjar, a Melbourne-based punk rock group. In mid-2006 Nursery Crimes reunited for a series of gigs in October and November with the line up of Dixon, Rose, Thomas, and McIness, joined by Ross Hetherington on drums (ex-Bodyjar).

Gregor Golobič

Gregor Golobič (born January 20, 1964) is a Slovenian politician. Since 2007, he has been serving as president of the left liberal party "Zares". Between November 2008 and June 2011, he served as Minister for Science and Higher Education of Slovenia.
Golobič was born in the Slovenian town of Novo Mesto, then in former Yugoslavia. He attended the prestigious Novo Mesto Grammar School. He enrolled at the University of Ljubljana, where he studied philosophy. In 1988, already as a student, he became employed by the Alliance of Socialist Youth of Slovenia, the youth organization of the League of Communists of Slovenia. Between 1992 and 2001, he served as the Secretary-General of the ruling Liberal Democracy of Slovenia. 
In 2001 Golobič left politics. In 2002 he obtained his BA in philosophy from the University of Ljubljana with a thesis on a Lacanian critique of the philosophy of Cratylus. In 2006 he quit his former party and in October 2007, he was elected president of the newly formed party "Zares", formed mostly by former members of the Liberal Democracy. In the 2008 parliamentary elections he was elected in the Slovenian National Assembly. In November of the same year, he was appointed Minister for Higher Education, Sciencae and Technology in the centre left government of Borut Pahor. At the ministry, József Györkös served as a state secretary.
On April 21, 2011, he announced his resignation as Minister due to disagreements with the policies of the Prime Minister Borut Pahor.
In June 2011, Golobič resigned from his position as Minister of Education. His resignation was followed by other ministers of the Zares party later in the same month, opening a government crisis, which was resolved in September 2011 with the vote of no confidence to Borut Pahor and the calling of early elections in December 2011.
Controversies.
In June 2009, Golobič was involved in a so called "Ultra scandal" named after the Slovenian IT company Ultra, where Golobič was employed between 2003 and 2007. He was accused of misleading the media about his investment into that company during the campaign for the 2008 parliamentary election. According to allegations, the company had some 21 million euro of unsecured loans at the state-owned Nova Ljubljanska Banka (NLB). When the media examined the loans, it came out that Golobič owns 10% of Ultra SUM, a Netherlands-based company which owns 70% of Ultra company. This was a fact that he had withheld from the public during the 2008 general election campaign. Golobič publicly apologized for having misled the public, but refused to resign as the minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology 
The Ultra Scandal was also one of the reasons for the decision of Matej Lahovnik, one of the co-founders of the party "Zares", to leave the party in July 2010. Lahovnik, at the time Minister of Economy, mentioned Golobič's alleged misuse of political influence in order to favor his business partners as one of the reasons for his break with the party. As a response, Golobič demanded that Lahovnik stepped down from his position of Minister of Economy and qualified his behavior as "Brutus-like", that is, treacherous.
Golobič is a close personal friend of the Slovenian Marxist philosopher Slavoj Žižek who frequently expressed admiration for him, once referring to Golobič as the "Slovenian Stalin". The epithet "Slovenian Stalin" has been frequently used since, mostly by his political opponents and the media.

The talk show was broadcast by the national Radiotelevizija Slovenija company in the prime time on Sunday evening, and paid with the money of taxpayers. The media characterised the conversation as prepared in advance in order to clear Kresal's name after the affairs she had found herself in. Kresal ascribed her political failure to her political partners and the fact that she was too successful. She did not exclude further political activity.

Blake (band)

Blake are a British vocal group. They are widely known as the group who formed on Facebook.
History.
They released their debut album "Blake" in November 2007, which won the Album of the Year Award at the Classical BRIT Awards in 2008. The album contains covers of popular classical songs and themes from the movies, to create a more commercial classical-pop crossover sound.
They sang for Shirley Bassey at her 70th birthday party, and performed in front of 80,000 football fans at Wembley Stadium. In the summer of 2007 their version of the "Swing Low" was chosen as the Official Anthem of the England rugby team for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. They sang at the opening of the 2008 Melbourne Cup in Australia and supported Katherine Jenkins on her UK tour. During Children in Need 2007, over £1,000,000 was raised while Blake were performing "God Only Knows".
Blake's second album, "And So It Goes", was released in September 2008. This contains more arrangements of pop music than the debut album, as well as a negro-spiritual and the Intermezzo from "Cavelleria Rusticana".
In February 2009, baritone Dominic Tighe announced that he was leaving the group, shortly before their maiden tour, to return to his acting career. The group continued with their use of social networking websites, by advertising for a new member on Twitter. After two weeks, and 55,000 subscribing to their "tweets", Humphrey Berney (better known as "Barney") joined the group.
The quartet, comprising Ollie Baines, Humphrey Berney, Jules Knight and Stephen Bowman, undertook their first full UK-tour, supported by Natasha Marsh in Spring 2009, and their third studio album, "Together", was released on 12 October 2009 on their own label, "Blake Records".
Though many of their live performances have been at sporting events - most notably singing the anthem for the Rugby world cup in 2007, multiple appearances at Twickenham and Wembley Stadia and the opening of Wimbledon Centre Court in 2009 - Blake have made a name for themselves by regularly singing for charity; particularly for cancer charities such as Marie Curie, Cancer Research UK and the British Heart Foundation; and Forces Charities such as Help for Heroes, the Royal British Legion and the Army Benevolent Fund. Blake released the song "Beautiful Earth" as the WWF's anthem for Earth Hour 2010.
Formation.
The quartet formed when Jules Knight and Ollie Baines (two school friends) contacted Dominic Tighe (whom Knight had studied with at Central School and had seen sing at the Old Vic) and Stephen Bowman (a student with Ollie at the Guildhall) on Facebook. Baines organised a rehearsal at the Guildhall, and after working out some successful harmonies, they wowed the audience at a house party with their arrangement of "Moon River".
The quartet then contacted Daniel Glatman, former boss of the boy band Blue and orchestrator of the success of the Fron Male Voice Choir, via Facebook. After a successful audition, Glatman agreed to manage the band, and shortly negotiated a £1m, five-album deal with Universal Classics and Jazz, following an intense bidding war.
They chose the name 'Blake' from a mutual appreciation of the poet William Blake, whose peerless thirst for innovation is much admired amongst the group. Also, 2007 was the 250th anniversary of the poet's birth.

Discography.
"Blake" (2007).
Following numerous television appearances, and singing at venues as diverse as Twickenham Stadium and Waterloo railway station, the group were caught up in a "whirlwind of public attention". Celebrities such as Keira Knightley, Will Smith, Ewan McGregor all proclaimed their support for the band, and Hans Zimmer asked them to sing on the soundtrack to "The Da Vinci Code" movie sequel, "Angels and Demons", after hearing their arrangement of his theme for "Gladiator".
Their debut album was released on 5 November 2007 and immediately went to the top of the UK Classical Album charts, and reached the top 20 of the UK Pop Album chart. The "polished fusion" of classical and pop, as heard in arrangements of the Beach Boys' hit "God Only Knows", the themes to Gladiator, 1492 Conquest of Paradise and several classical favourites recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra proved a huge hit, and the album went Gold within three weeks. Early in 2008, the album was nominated for a Classical BRIT Award and was named "Album of the Year" in May. It was only the second time in nine years that the award for best album, as voted for by listeners to Classic FM, was won by a debut album (following Russell Watson's "The Voice" in 2001.
"And So It Goes" (2008).
Blake's second album contains a wider range of material than the debut album. There are no film score arrangements this time, but tracks range from "Chasing Cars" by Snow Patrol, through to the arrangement of "Sancta Maria" from the opera "Cavalleria Rusticana" and the negro-spiritual "Steal Away". Knight explained that the album has "a different sound to it, it's more contemporary, more pop-py. Combining both classical sounds and pop sounds is a winning combination, and we’ve taken it a lot further on this album."
"Together" (2009).
The third album, "Together", and the first to include Berney, was released on 12 October. The album again contains tracks from several genres, including opera, musical theatre, film themes and pop songs. The album was recorded with the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra with arranger Paul Bateman, once again produced by Nick Patrick and Adrian Munsey. The album was nominated for "Album of the Year" at the 2010 Classical BRITs. The album was released on the band's own independent label, Blake Records, distributed by EMI Label Services.

Don Ultang

Don Ultang or Donald Theodore Ultang (March 23, 1917 – September 18, 2008) was an American photographer, a pioneer in aerial photography and a Pulitzer Prize winner.
Ultang was born in Fort Dodge, Iowa and raised in Cedar Rapids. He attended the University of Iowa, earning a degree in economics in 1939. Shortly after his graduation from college, he was hired by the "Des Moines Register". After being hired by "The Register", he signed up to participate in a government-funded pilot training program and served in the United States Navy during World War II as a flight instructor.
After returning to civilian life, he convinced The Register to purchase a Beechcraft Bonanza to be used for aerial photography. As the paper's only pilot, he would use the plane to take panoramic photos of news events such as a train wreck or flood from the plane using his Speed Graphix camera. Ultang would fly the plane solo over the target at a few hundred above the ground, keep his plane in a 45 to 50 degree banking turn and about 20 miles per hour above stall speed, briefly release one of his hands from the controls for about five seconds to take the desired sequence of photographs, and retake the controls to circle around for another series of shots.
A portfolio of Ultang's photographs was printed in "U.S. Camera, 1954" together with works by Ansel Adams, in an annual work published by Duell, Sloan and Pearce. In 1991, the Iowa State University Press published a book of his work, "Holding the Moment: Mid-America at Mid-Century." Ultang retired after 20 years at the Register and took a job at an insurance company. In recognition of his pioneering career, Ultang was inducted by the Iowa Aviation Hall of Fame in 1991.
After Ultang retired, and spent his winters in New Mexico, he began a second career taking nature and landscape photographs until a few years before his death. Ultang died in his sleep on September 18, 2008 aged 91.
Career.
Johnny Bright Incident.
In 1952 the "Des Moines Register" photographers Ultang and John Robinson won the 1952 Pulitzer Prize for Photography, the same year that Herman Wouk won for his novel "The Caine Mutiny". The prize recognized a series of six pictures showing a violent on-field assault against an African American player during a college football game: October 20, 1951, in Stillwater, Oklahoma, between host Oklahoma A&M (now Oklahoma State University Cowboys) and visiting Drake University Bulldogs. A&M's white Wilbanks Smith placed a hard hit on Drake's black Johnny Bright, breaking his jaw, in an incident caught in a series of images taken by Ultang that earned national attention when they appeared on the front page of "The Register". The event came to be known as the "Johnny Bright Incident".
Ultang was one of 18 recipients of the 1952 National Headliner Awards ceremonies held in Atlantic City, New Jersey, winning in the "Sports action picture" category, together with John Robinson, for their photographs of the "Johnny Bright Slugging".

Exponentially equivalent measures

In mathematics, the notion of exponential equivalence of measures is a concept that describes how two sequences or families of probability measures are “the same” from the point of view of large deviations theory.
Definition.
Let ("M", "d") be a metric space and consider two one-parameter families of probability measures on "M", say ("μ""ε")"ε">0 and ("ν""ε")"ε">0. These two families are said to be exponentially equivalent if there exist
such that
The two families of random variables ("Y""ε")"ε">0 and ("Z""ε")"ε">0 are also said to be exponentially equivalent.
Properties.
The main use of exponential equivalence is that as far as large deviations principles are concerned, exponentially equivalent families of measures are indistinguishable. More precisely, if a large deviations principle holds for ("μ""ε")"ε">0 with good rate function "I", and ("μ""ε")"ε">0 and ("ν""ε")"ε">0 are exponentially equivalent, then the same large deviations principle holds for ("ν""ε")"ε">0 with the same good rate function "I".

Dart Pleasure Craft Limited

River Link is the trading name of Dart Pleasure Craft Limited, a ferry, cruise boat and bus operator, based in Devon, England. The company is owned by Dart Valley Railway plc, who also own and operate the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway.
Services.
River Link operates the Dartmouth Passenger Ferry, which connects the terminus of the steam railway at Kingswear station to the waterfront at Dartmouth, on the opposite bank of River Dart. It also operates river and coastal cruises from Dartmouth, including a cruise the length of the tidal Dart to the Steamer Quay in Totnes. 
The railway between Paignton and Kingswear, the ferry from Kingswear to Dartmouth, and the river cruise from Dartmouth to Totnes form three segments of a heavily promoted round-trip known as the "Round Robin". In order to close the loop, River Link operates a bus service, often using open top buses, between Totnes and Paignton.
Current Fleet.
Dart Pleasure Craft currently operate a fleet of 9 major vessels, as well as 3 small 12 passenger boats.
Cardiff Castle The largest vessel in the fleet carrying 400 passengers. Built in 1964 for the River Dart Steamboat Company. From 1977 operated for the Millbrook Steamboat and Trading Company out of Plymouth, but returned to the Dart in 1985, and has operated for Dart Pleasure Craft ever since. Presently mainly used on the Totnes service.
Dart Explorer A modern catamaran, carrying 300 passengers and built for the company in 1991 as "Devonair Belle". She is mainly used on the 1 hour harbour cruise, and also operates most of the charters and evening disco cruises.
Dartmouth Castle built in 1947 by Phillip & Sons Ship builders and Engineers, she was previously operated by the Milbrook Steamboat and Trading Company, the Dartmouth Castle was originally intended to be built as a Paddle Steamer but was fitted with twin diesel engines just before completion, she now operates on the river dart mainly used as the second totnes service vessel.
Dart Venturer Originally built as "Plymouth Venturer" for Plymouth Boat Cruises in 1982, this 300 passenger vessel ran for them until 2002, when it was "swapped" with Dart Pleasure Craft's smaller "Plymouth Belle". Used on all of the services.
Dittisham Princess Built as the Flagship of G.H. Riddall's fleet in 1995, this 181 passenger vessel was taken over in 2000. Despite being the newest member of the fleet, she appears to see little service.
Dartmouth Princess Built as the "Devon Belle II" in 1990, she joined the G.H Riddall fleet in 1995. Since being taken over by Dart Pleasure craft in 2000 she has become the main ferry on the short Dartmouth-Kingswear route.
Kingswear Belle Originally built in 1972 for service in the Channel Islands as "Herm Trident II" she was bought by Dart Pleasure Craft in 1989 for use on the Kingswear Ferry, where she can cary 23 passengers. She had a major fire in 2006. Since the purchase of Dartmouth Princess she sees little use.
Kingswear Princess built in 1978 at Conyer Marine in Kent the Kingswear Princess was bought by the Dartmouth Riverboat Company in 2010, she is now used as the winter & Reserve Ferry if the Dartmouth Princess is out of Service.
Edgecumbe Belle A small ferry with a very long and complex history. One of two sisters built in 1957 for British Rail as "Humphrey Gilbert" (her sister was "Adrian Gilbert"), for use on the Dartmouth-Kingswear ferry service. When the Paignton-Kingswear branch line was closed by British Rail, the two ferries passed briefly into local authority ownership, then were sold for use on the Falmouth - St Mawes Ferry. Following a sale back to BR for use on the Tilbury-Gravesend ferry, they were deemed unsuitable for use on either of these two routes. The "Adrian Gilbert" returned to the Kingswear ferry in 1977. After a period of inactivity, owned by various companies, the "Humphrey Gilbert" was sold to Millbrook Steamboat and Trading Company, renamed "Edgecumbe Belle" and used on their Plymouth - Drake's Island ferry. She returned to the Dart in 1985, when she partnered her sister on the Kingswear Ferry until 1996, when "Adrian Gilbert" was sold, somewhat ironically to the St Mawes Ferry Company, where she continues to work quite successfully. "Edgecumbe Belle" on the other hand, remains as the main relief vessel on the Kingswear ferry, and sees a large amount of service. She briefly ran a service to Greenway, but this has now been withdrawn, and Dart Pleasure Craft instead market the former rival service operated by Greenway Ferry Limited.

The Con (video game)

The Con, released as Gamble Con Fight in Japan, is a fighting video game that was released for the PlayStation Portable on October 18, 2005. It was developed by Think & Feel Inc. The story follows the life of a con artist who fights for money.
A Con artist is introduced to underground fighting by Reina. He/she wins twice and then the protagonist is taught how to make money, and he/she has to do the following: Fight to win, Pull off a comeback con, start like a loser and make a comeback, and take a dive, start like a winner and then lose.
Then Reina is killed by Kuro. The protagonist then recruits two other fighters and form a team. Team (name) fight to get invited to the Big Time, where the winners of the tournament get 10 million dollars. They defeat Boneyard and his team Phantom of rank D (24-2), Smoke and his team Extreme of rank C (26-2),Shaman and his team Demoish of team B (36-2), Cinder and her team Crimson of rank A (52-6) and opotionally, Cornfed and his team Triumph (57-0) (it is not requiered to defeat team Triumph to go to the Big Time Tournament.) But when that team jumps to rank A, Smoke, whom they fought at rank C, will want to join his/her team. If the protagonist wants him, he/she is going to have to choose which fighting style Smoke is going to fight as. Yes, Smoke masters every style in the game. But at the cost of another team member. One is going home, while Smoke joins the team. If he/she says no, he leaves immediately and there is no other offer.
Once they get to the Big Time tournament, that team fights to the finals, in the semi-finas defeating Shades and his team. But something strange happens during the finals. If the player accepted Smoke's offer, he betrayes the team to join team Mencace, alongside Cornfed and Kuro (they may have fought Cornfed at rank S already.) If he/she did not accept it, one of the team members is killed. Either way, that team is going to have to fight team Menace with two members.
But still, they defeat team Menace and bring home that prize money, and optionally the protagonist avenges Reina's death.
Quick Play
There are three modes: arcade, time-attack- and survival.
Quick play: in this mode, there are eleven stages. The first nine are random, and the final two are always the same: Hardcase, a supposedly disgraced man as he wears a cloth which covers his mouth and has scars on his body, and Mask a man whose fighting style is dependent on the player; if the player is a street boxer, he is a street boxer too, etc.

Universal variable formulation

In orbital mechanics, the universal variable formulation is a method used to solve the two-body Kepler problem. It is a generalized form of Kepler's Equations, extending them to apply not only to elliptic orbits, but also parabolic and hyperbolic orbits. It thus is applicable to many situations in the solar system, where orbits of widely varying eccentricities are present.
Introduction.
A common problem in orbital mechanics is the following: given a body in an orbit and a time "t0", find the position of the body at any other given time "t".
For elliptical orbits with a reasonably small eccentricity, solving Kepler's Equation by methods like Newton's method gives adequate results. However, as the orbit becomes more and more eccentric, the numerical iteration may start to converge slowly or not at all. Furthermore, Kepler's equation cannot be applied to parabolic and hyperbolic orbits, since it specifically is tailored to elliptic orbits.
Derivation.
Although equations similar to Kepler's equation can be derived for parabolic and hyperbolic orbits, it is more convenient to introduce a new independent variable to take the place of the eccentric anomaly "E", and having a single equation that can be solved regardless of the eccentricity of the orbit. The new variable "s" is defined by the following differential equation:
where formula_2 is the time-dependent distance to the center of attraction. The fundamental equation formula_3 is regularized by applying this change of variables to yield:
where P is a constant vector and formula_5 is defined by
The equation is the same as the equation for the harmonic oscillator, a well-known equation in both physics and mathematics. Taking the derivative again, we get a third-degree differential equation:
The family of solutions to this differential equation are written symbolically as the functions formula_8 where the functions formula_9, called Stumpff functions, are generalizations of sine and cosine functions. Applying this results in:
which is the universal variable formulation of Kepler's Equation. This equation can now be solved numerically using a root-finding algorithm such as Newton's method or Laguerre's method for a given time formula_11 to yield formula_12, which in turn is used to compute the f and g functions:
The values of the f and g functions determine the position of the body at the time formula_11:
In addition the velocity of the body at time formula_11 can be found using formula_17 and formula_18 as follows:
where formula_20 and formula_21 are the position and velocity respectively at time formula_11, and formula_23 and formula_24 are the position and velocity, respectively, at arbitrary initial time formula_25.

Marquis of Vila Viçosa

The title Marquis of Vila Viçosa (in Portuguese "Marquês de Vila Viçosa") was created by royal decree, dated May 25, 1455, by King Afonso V of Portugal), to Fernando of Braganza, second son of Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza.
"Dom" Fernando, was already 3rd Count of Arraiolos when he got the new title of Marquis of Vila Viçosa. Later, in 1460, as his older brother Afonso, died without legitimate issue, he became the House of Braganza heir and, one year later, following his father’s death (1461), he also became the 2nd Duke of Braganza.
That’s why the title Marquis of Vila Viçosa became associated with the title Duke of Braganza.
The Queen consort Amélie of Orleans, while in exile (20th Century), also used the title of Marchioness of Vila Viçosa.

Why (Jadakiss song)

"Why" is a protest song by rapper Jadakiss, released as the second single from his second solo album "Kiss of Death". It features singer Anthony Hamilton in the chorus and was produced by Mobb Deep member Havoc. It was a crossover hit in several countries. The song ranked #64 in About.com's Top 100 Rap Songs. The remix produced by Elite with a new chorus was later released featuring Anthony Hamilton, Styles P, Common, and Nas. Another remix was released, titled "Why 2K7", featuring rapper Lil' Wayne. This remix is available on DJ 007's "Beast of the East", a collaboration mixtape with Fabolous and Jadakiss.
Although not a remix nor a sequel, Jadakiss released the song 'What If' that almost follows the same concept as 'Why': All his verses starts of with the latter title. It included Nas (who - as mentioned above - was featured in the remix of Why) and it is featured on his album The Last Kiss.
Controversy.
Jadakiss attracted some controversy and condemnation from political commentator Bill O'Reilly, who labeled him a "smear merchant" due to lyrics in the song, which state Jada's belief that George W. Bush coordinated the September 11 attacks:
"Bush" is censored in clean versions of the song. The music video shows a man holding up a picket sign reading "BUCK FUSH" - a spoonerism of "FUCK BUSH".
Bill O'Reilly took the position that the President should be allowed to sue Jadakiss for slander. The track was eventually banned on some radio stations or played with the lyrics in question censored.

Olé (Azúcar Moreno album)

Olé is the ninth studio album by Spanish duo Azúcar Moreno, released on Sony International in 1998. 
After the commercial success of the 1996 album "Esclava De Tu Piel" which had produced five hit singles followed by "Muévete Salvaje" from the 1997 hits compilation "Mucho Azúcar - Grandes Éxitos", Azúcar Moreno teamed up with producer Ricardo "Eddy" Martinez in Miami again for the recording of 1998 album "Olé". The album included further original material from Spanish singer Miguel Gallardo and Luis Cabañas, the team that had composed most of the singles on the preceding "Esclava De Tu Piel", collaborations between Gallardo and David Ferrero and Pedro del Moral, songs by producer Richardo "Eddy" Martinez and it also saw one of the Salazar sisters, Encarna, making her debut as composer on the track "Dime Que Me Quieres". Production-wise "Olé" followed the winning combination of up-to-date club beats fused with flamenco and rock and contrasting R&B influenced ballads and rumbas, arrangement-wise the album differed slightly to its predecessor as it featured live strings on several titles. The album also closes with the acoustic "No Pretenderás", with instrumentation of just flamenco guitars and palmas - and a guest appearance by the duo's brothers Los Chunguitos.
The lead single was the title track "Olé", just like "Sólo Se Vive Una Vez" musically influenced by contemporary dance genres like reggaeton and dancehall but, as the title suggests, lyrically a tribute to the duo's native Spain. "Olé" was also released as two separate remix singles, the second entitled "Olé - The Summer '99 Remixes" featuring the track remixed and with additional production by renowned Latin remixer, DJ, music producer and arranger Pablo Flores, best known for being Gloria Estefan's personal remixer but also for having co-produced major hits for among others Madonna, Chayanne, Shakira and Ricky Martin. Flores' Club Mix of "Olé" was substantially rearranged from the original, not just by speeding up the tempo for the dancefloor but by adding new orchestration of brass, flamenco guitars and castanets to emphasize the song's lyrics and the track proved to be another big hit single for Azúcar Moreno in both Spain and Latin America.
The second single released and second big hit was "¡Mecachis!" ("Mechachis en la mar" a mildly profane expression, roughly translated as "Damnit!"), a midtempo dance track again written by Miguel Gallardo and Luis Cabañas and also issued with a series of dance remixes on the "¡Mechachis! - The Alabim-Bom-Ba-Remixes" release, mixed by co-producers Pedro del Moral and David Ferrero.
Further hit singles from the album include "Cumbaya", the double A-side "Ese Beso"/"No Pretenderás" and "Agua Que No Has De Beber".
While "Olé" didn't manage to match the extraordinary sales figures of the preceding "Esclava De Tu Piel" - half a million in Spain alone - it did sell some two-hundred thousand copies and was later awarded double platinum in Spain.

Philip of Dreux

Philip of Dreux (Philippe de Dreux) (1158–1217) was a French nobleman, Bishop of Beauvais, and figure of the Third Crusade. 
He was an active soldier, an ally in the field of Philip Augustus, the French king and his cousin, making him an opponent in campaigns in France and elsewhere of Richard I of England. He was in also in demand as a priest, to make and break marriages. He presided over that of Conrad of Montferrat at the siege of Acre, marrying him to Isabella I of Jerusalem, daughter of Amalric I, whose divorce he had approved. He was also party to the divorce of Philip Augustus from Ingeborg of Denmark.
Life.
He was son of Robert I of Dreux, and brother of Robert II of Dreux. 
He first campaigned in Palestine in 1180, in an expedition headed by Henry II of Champagne and Peter of Courtenay. This attack on Saladin's holdings was ineffectual.
Robert II and Philip of Dreux arrived with forces in Palestine in 1189. 
Richard Lionheart bore him a consistent enmity after the Crusade; Philip of Dreux had been one of those relaying the rumour that Richard was responsible for the killing of Conrad of Montferrat. Subsequently Philip had gone to Germany, when Richard was imprisoned, to advocate against setting him free. There, Philip encouraged Richard's captors to treat him poorly, earning the lifelong hatred of Richard, who considered him "a robber and an incendiary".
He was captured by Angevin forces under the mercenary leader Mercadier in a Normandy campaign, in 1197. Richard was still refusing to release him a year later, and again early in 1199. When Peter of Capua (who was trying to enlist Richard for the Fourth Crusade) insisted that Richard release Philip, Richard exploded and threatened to castrate Peter, so intense was his hatred of his prisoner Philip. Pope Celestine III was unsympathetic to Philip, confined at Rouen and then, after an escape attempt, at Chinon. He was freed only after Richard’s death in 1199, with John of England agreeing to exchange him for the captured bishop-elect of Cambrai in 1200.
In 1210 he was in action against the Cathars in southern France, with Renaud de Mouçon, bishop of Chartres, in support of Simon de Montfort.
He drew support from Philip Augustus in his conflict against Renaud de Dammartin, leading to Renaud's 1212 alliance with John. Philip was later a combatant on the victorious French side in 1214 at the Battle of Bouvines. He took a mace to William Longsword, Earl of Salisbury, at an important moment in the battle, leading to the Earl’s capture.

The Mangalorean Catholic Cuisine is incomplete without the presence of the Sannas. They are a much-loved bread served along with the Pork Bafat, a spicy pork dish prepared with a medley of spices called the 'bafat masala powder'. Sannas are also served alongside chicken or mutton curries. They can also be eaten for breakfast along with coconut chutney or sambhar and can be enjoyed with sweet roce (coconut milk sweetened with jaggery and flavoured with cardamom).
Sannas were often called as "Hitt" or "Hittli" in old Konkani by Hindus, and now commonly known as "Idli". They make Sannas on various religious occasions like Ganesh Chaturthi, Saunsar padvo/Yugadi and Makar Sankranti. Whereas the Catholics prepare it during the church feasts. Sometimes sweet version is made with jaggery, known as "godachi sanna" (). 
Hindus normally use urad dal, coconut water and coconut milk for fermentation. Catholic Sannas consist of two types: toddy fermented sannas and the other made using the sap of the coconut palms.
In modern times toddy fermented sannas are rarely made. Instead, the batter can be leavened with yeast.

Reassuringly Expensive

Reassuringly Expensive was the Stella Artois' advertising slogan in the United Kingdom from 1982 until 2007. The 1990s UK television advertising campaigns became known for their distinctive style of imitating European cinema and their leitmotif taken from the score of "Jean de Florette", inspired, in turn, by Giuseppe Verdi's "La forza del destino". The TV campaigns began in 1991 with a series of adverts based on "Jean de Florette", directed by the British duo Anthea Benton and Vaughan Arnell, moving on to other genres including war movies, silent comedy and even surrealism (for which the slogan was changed to "Reassuringly Elephants"). They have used notable movie directors such as Jonathan Glazer, and their aim was to portray the drink in a context of sophisticated European culture.
History.
The "Reassuringly Expensive" campaign began in 1982. Frank Lowe of Collett Dickinson Pearce worked on marketing for Stella Artois in the 1970s, creating print campaigns such as "My shout, he whispered". In 1981, Lowe left Collett Dickinson Pearce to form his own advertising agency, taking with him the Stella Artois account. Within a year, Lowe launched the "Reassuringly Expensive" campaign, which aimed to turn a substantial negative for the brand (higher prices due to greater Duty on high-alcohol content beverages in the United Kingdom) into a positive, assuring customers that by being more expensive, the premium lager was better than cheaper brands. Earlier pieces were primarily print campaigns, but in 1990, a chance viewing of "Jean de Florette" led one of Lowe's creative directors to pen a script based on a similar concept. The resulting television and cinema advertisement, "Jacques de Florette", proved immensely popular and formed the basis for a series of six award-winning adverts produced between 1991 and 2001. "Good Doctor" was announced in February 2002 as the seventh in the series.
During 2007, the "reassuringly expensive" slogan was dropped, and the word "Stella" has been avoided in the advertisements. This has been seen as a reaction to the lager's perceived connection with aggression and binge-drinking in the United Kingdom, where it is nicknamed "wife beater".
Jacques de Florette.
"Jacques de Florette" was the first of the Reassuringly Expensive series. It was directed by Michael Seresin, the cinematographer on "Bugsy Malone" and "Midnight Express", and was shown in 1991.
Good Doctor.
"Good Doctor" (also credited as "Doctor" or "Plague") is a television and cinema advertisement released in 2002 by Interbrew to promote its Stella Artois brand of lager within the United Kingdom. The 100-second spot, involving a doctor treating victims of cholera and being shunned by the villagers until a priest demands that he be given a Stella Artois, was produced by advertising agency Lowe Lintas & Partners in London. "Good Doctor" premiered on British television in January 2002, with later appearances in cinemas. It is the seventh piece in the Jean de Florette-inspired "Reassuringly Expensive" series that had been running since 1992. The commercial was a popular, financial, and critical success, boosting sales during the period in which it ran, and receiving more awards than any other campaign in 2002, including a Cannes Gold Lion, an Epica Award and several prizes from the D&AD Awards.

Jack Hillman

Jack Hillman (30 October 1871 – 1 August 1955) was an English football goalkeeper who played for Burnley, Everton, Dundee, Manchester City and Millwall.
Career.
Jack Hillman was born in Tavistock, Devon, but it was in Lancashire that he made his reputation. In 1890 Hillman was playing for the Young Pilgrims, a junior side affiliated with Plymouth Argyle. An impressive performance against Burnley reserves prompted the Football League club to sign him, and he made his first team debut in 1891. He played for the club for the majority of the next decade, aside from two years at Everton, and a brief spell at Dundee. 
Hillman was known throughout his career as "Happy Jack" and spent four years at Turf Moor before being sold to Everton for £150 in February 1895. He was unable to settle at Goodison Park and in June 1886 he moved on to Dundee. His time at Dundee was not a great success, and midway through the 1897–98 season he was suspended by the club for "not trying", although at the time the club was bankrupt and unable to pay Hillman's wages. He returned to Burnley in March 1898, for a fee of £725.
On 18 February 1899, Hillman made his only international appearance against Ireland. The match was played at Roker Park, Sunderland's new ground and ended in a 13–2 victory for England, with four goals from Gilbert Smith and three from Jimmy Settle. The scoreline in this match is the record number of goals scored by England in a single match, and also the highest aggregate goals (15) in a game involving England.
In the 1898–99 season Burnley were struggling to avoid relegation from the First Division. Going into their final match of the season, against Nottingham Forest, Burnley needed to win to stand a chance of survival. Hillman attempted to bribe the Forest players, offering them £2 each to "take it easy". At half-time he increased his offer to £5, but Burnley lost 4–0 and were relegated. After the game, the Forest secretary wrote to the F.A. to complain about Hillman's activities. Hillman was summoned to a joint F.A.-Football League commission in Manchester. Hillman's defence was that the whole thing had been a joke, apparently inspired by suspicions around Forest's 8–0 defeat against West Bromwich Albion a few weeks previously. Hillman claimed that he was only asking for a similar favour. The Football Association were not convinced by Hillman's explanation and banned him for a season for his actions. The incident is the earliest recorded case of match fixing in the sport. Once his ban had expired, he returned to the Burnley team.
In January 1902 Hillman was transferred to Manchester City. He made his Manchester City debut on 1 February 1902 in a First Division match against Notts County at Hyde Road. He subsequently played in all 13 remaining league fixtures that season, but was unable to prevent City being relegated at the end of the season. City only spent one season in the Second Division and were promoted as champions in 1903, going on to take second place in the First Division in 1904. Hillman was also part of the Manchester City team which won the FA Cup in 1904, the club's first major trophy, remaining as first choice keeper until 1906.
During the 1905–06 season he was supplanted as first choice goalkeeper by John Edmondson. In the 1906 close season the Football Association investigated Manchester City's accounts for bonuses, which though commonplace among leading football clubs, were not permitted under FA rules. The FA chose to make an example of City, and Hillman was one of seventeen players suspended until 1 January 1907, and banned from representing the club again. Hillman was also fined £50. The ban on playing for Manchester City was rescinded in 1908, but Hillman never played for the club again.
He joined Millwall Athletic in January 1907, although his playing career soon came to an end with an elbow injury.
When he retired as a footballer he returned to live in Burnley and became a confectioner although, after the First World War, he returned to Turf Moor as a trainer for a year.

MorphXT

eMule MorphXT is a peer-to-peer file sharing application for Microsoft Windows released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), as is its parent software eMule.
eMule connects to both the eDonkey network and the Kad network. The distinguishing features of eMule are the direct exchange of sources between client nodes, fast recovery of corrupted downloads, and the use of a credit system to reward frequent uploaders. Furthermore, eMule transmits data and control codes in zlib-compressed form to save bandwidth.
History.
The original eMule program was released under the GPL on 7 July 2002. The license allowed free modification of the software, and the first MorphXT mod was released on 21 January 2003 by a user using the name "morpheus". Between version MorphXT 2.0 and 8.3, the main developer used the name "SiRoB".
In September 2006 SiRoB announced he would cease development, since the French DADVSI copyright law made it illegal to develop peer-to-peer programs in France. Since then releases have been less frequent, although whenever eMule increases its minor version number, MorphXT increases its major version number.
Differences from eMule.
MorphXT has the following additional differences to eMule:
Development.
Several improvements first introduced in MorphXT have been incorporated back into the original eMule program.
The MorphXT team recently switched to using Git for version control, and keeps a private repository. The public repository on SourceForge is being updated as releases are made.
Criticism.
MorphXT's anti leeching system is based on static comparison of version strings. Some users have criticized this method, because it bans some clients that are not actively leeching, but are potentially capable of doing so. In addition, since the software adds functionality to the already complex eMule program, it can become too complex for many users.
Fake version.
Several versions of MorphXT have been released demanding a fee to download the software.

Flag and coat of arms of Pahang

The flag and the coat of arms of Pahang are state symbols of Pahang, Malaysia. While adopting simpler design on its flag and arms, the state symbols remain representative towards its administration, monarchy, and economy. In addition, its arms includes elements related to local superstitions.
Flag.
Design.
The flag of Pahang consists of a simple horizontal bicolour flag with equally proportionate bands of white on the upper half and black on the lower half. The black represents the official colour of the "bendahara", which was once the administrator of the state, while the white represents the Sultan of Pahang; the white over the black symbolises Pahang as a sovereign state with a royal monarch, as well as its presence of special privileges, laws, customs and codes of conduct, and specific rights of the Sultan.
Variants.
As a formerly independent state under the Federated Malay States, Pahang adopted a naval jack or ensign for use on government ships, consisting of a quartered saltire that bore the colours of the state flag: Black on the leftmost and rightmost quarters, and white on the upper and lower quarters. The merger of the state into the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and the adoption of a unified maritime flag rendered the Pahang jack obsolete.
As a member of the Federated Malay State, Pahang was also assigned a British Resident, and with it, a flag for the Resident that was essentially the state flag forked at the fly. The flag is similarly obsolete after the abolishment of British Residents in the state in 1938.
Coat of arms.
Pahang's coat of arms () consists of four elements: The spear head, Jawi scriptures between the spear head, dual tusks, and a motto at the bottom. The arms is entirely coloured in gold to symbolise gold as the state's most valuable resource (from mining towns in the state such as Raub) in 1862. The colour is also intended to symbolise the strength of gold; the metal was a powerful tool against immunity magic.
Details of the arms' elements are as followed:

Interpreter officer

An interpreter officer is a commissioned officer of an armed force, who interprets and/or translates to facilitate military operation. Interpreter officers are used extensively in multinational operations in which two or more countries that do not share a common language are undertaking a joint operation, or expeditionary missions in which the communication with the local population is crucial but limited by lack of language proficiency among the expeditionary force personnel. Interpreter officers also work in the intelligence gathering and analysis though in many countries, civilian analysts are used instead of the officers in active duty. 
Examples by country.
United States.
Interpreting services are provided by personnel from 223rd Military Intelligence Battalion (United States). The United States Military have used the Arabic linguists in the war in Iraq for example. 
Republic of Korea.
The Republic of Korea has a history of continuous presence of United States forces. Because the military personnel of both countries usually lack proficiency in each other’s language, a corps of interpreter officers were trained to facilitate communication. Each service branch has its own group of interpreter officers. They participate in meetings, high level conferences or day-to-day informal discussions to offer simultaneous or consecutive translation, usually between English and Korean. During the military drills such as RSOI and Ulchi Freedom Guardian, the demand for rapid translation of the communications among the forces of the combined command peaks and the interpreter officers play a crucial role in the seamless operations of the drills. 
The majority of the interpreter officers work in English to Korean interpretation. A minor of interpreter officers are also available in Chinese and Japanese though far fewer than those of English. Many but not all of the interpreter officers have spent many years abroad often in the English speaking countries. Serving as interpreter officer is a popular way for the Korean nationals studying in North America to do the mandatory military service because of the prestige and networking opportunity despite the length of the service which is slightly over three years. 
The camaraderie among the interpreter officer is relatively strong compare to the class of the officer candidate school because the group is small and culturally homogeneous. The interpreter officers as a group are western oriented, for the qualification exam requires considerable level of fluency in English as mandatory. Many interpreter officers pursue careers in the financial services or law after discharge. 
Clubs.
There are several clubs for current and former interpreter officers. 
There are two online clubs for the Republic of Korea Army interpreter officers.

Richard Marsh (bishop)

Richard Marsh (died 1 May 1226), also called Richard de Marisco, served as Lord Chancellor of England and Bishop of Durham.
Life.
Marsh attended a university, as he was styled "magister", but which university it was is unknown. His ancestry and upbringing likewise are unknown. He was a royal clerk and canon of Exeter Cathedral before becoming Archdeacon of Northumberland by 1 November 1211. He was also Archdeacon of Richmond. During that time he was also serving in the financial administration. In 1210 he earned a mention as one of the king's "evil councilors."
During 1212 Marsh held the office of Sheriff of Somerset and Dorset. Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, threatened Marsh with excommunication over Marsh's exactions from the Church during the interdict of John's reign. Marsh went to Rome in 1213, to negotiate on both his own behalf and on his king's behalf, and succeeded in getting much more lenient terms from the pope than had originally been given. He served as Chancellor from 29 October 1214 until his death. However, his title was mostly honorary after his election as a bishop, for he no longer attended court all the time, and Ralph Neville, who had custody of the king's seal, did most of the actual work of the office of chancellor.
Marsh was elected Bishop of Durham about 27 June 1217 and consecrated probably on 2 July 1217. His election had been promoted by the papal legate, Guala Bicchieri, and his consecration was performed by Archbishop Walter de Gray of York at Gloucester.
In 1224, when Fawkes de Breauté kidnapped a royal justice and held him in Bedford Castle, Marsh voluntarily contributed to the carucage that had been voted by the clergy of the ecclesiastical province of Canterbury, even though he was a member of the province of York. This carucage was voted to help with the expenses of the siege and taking of Bedford Castle. Marsh continued the quarrel between the cathedral chapter and the bishops over the revenues and rights of the monks.
Marsh died on 1 May 1226, quite suddenly at Peterborough Abbey while on his way to London for a hearing in the lawsuit between the monks and himself. His nephew, Adam Marsh, was his heir, and received his large library as a bequest.

<doc id="19385576" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19385576" title="Sophitia">
Sophitia

, better known as just Sophitia, is a fictional character in the "Soul" series of video games. Created by Namco's Project Soul division, she first appeared in "Soul Edge" and its subsequent sequels, as well as appearing in various merchandise related to the series. 
A baker-turned warrior, Sophitia became involved in the search for the cursed sword, Soul Edge, following the blessings of the Olympian god of fire and forge, Hephaestus. The affair soon affected her other family members as well, including her sister, Cassandra, and later her children, Pyrrha and Patroklos. The character has received positive reception, often noted for her sexualized portrayal in the series.
Character design.
As a character introduced in "Soul Edge", Sophitia's weaponry, a sword and shield combination designed to be unique amongst the other weapons in the game, were selected before other elements of the character. Her design and concept were then built to revolve around it, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. After her appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist, her character was rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on her, and then animated by Tomoe Yamashita using motion capture to create her in-game movements. Tomoe, who additionally created the "struck" movements for many other characters in the game, noted particular fondness for Sophitia while designing her.
During her creation, designers focused on maintaining an innocent appearance for her face, to give the character a sense of feeling fresh and young. Freedom of movement between the sword and shield were also emphasized, with the intention to allow for the blade to rotate around the shield for cyclonic attacks. An alternate character called Azula was conceived during the development of Sophitia's secondary outfit in "Soul Edge", but was abandoned. The character concept would later be revisited in "Soulcalibur IV", appearing as an ally character in Sophitia's story mode and using her fighting style.
Appearances.
Sophitia's life as a warrior began when she was chosen as one of the twenty six warriors to receive an oracle from the Olympian god of fire and forge, Hephaestus. While she was bathing in a forest, Hephaestus appeared and told her of the evil blade Soul Edge: that the existence of such a powerful blade would put shame to his name, as he had not created it, and that if anyone were to discover it, it would bring much pain to the world. Hephaestus ordered her to come to the Eurydice Shrine and receive a holy weapon, the Omega Sword, so that she could destroy the Soul Edge. Sophitia eventually found the Soul Edge in a port in Valencia, Spain; and she fought its possessor, the dread pirate Cervantes de Leon, destroying one of the twin blades. However, shards of the evil sword flew with great force from her powerful blow wounding her too greatly to finish the fight. Just as Cervantes was about to deliver a finishing blow to the endangered Sophitia, the demon huntress ninja Taki arrived to save her and proceeded to kill Cervantes. After the battle had finished, Taki removed most of the Soul Edge shards that damaged Sophitia, but was unable to remove the one embedded near her heart without killing her, thus leaving it as it was. She then carried Sophitia back to Athens, where her sister, Cassandra, had been waiting for her. Cassandra was the only member of her family or group of friends to believe her story at the time.
After recovering from her wounds she suffered from the sword fragments, she returned to her life as the daughter of a baker and spent her days peacefully. However, one day, when she was out for shopping with Cassandra, Sophitia had a vision of Nightmare and the true Soul Edge. She collapsed and rescued by a local swordsmith named Rothion, they fell in love, and got engaged. Later, she received a second oracle from Hephaestus to destroy the remains of Soul Edge. Hephaestus then supplied her with holy metal, which Rothion used to forge a new Omega Sword and Elk shield; she set out on a second journey to destroy the cursed sword. While she was unable to find Soul Edge, it was ultimately shattered by Xianghua anyway, thus Sophitia returned home where she married Rothion and gave birth to a daughter, Pyrrha, and later a son, Patroklos. 
Four years afterward, Rothion received a shard of Soul Edge from a mysterious customer, and his and Sophitia's children began fighting over the shard. The evil aura the fragment emanated caused Sophitia's old wounds to ache, as they had been undoubtedly infected with the evil energy of the Soul Edge seven years previous, explaining her children's predilection for the bizarre aura. Cassandra, desperate to save her sister, proceeded to grab the shard from her grasp and run out the door, running away from home soon afterwards. A couple of weeks later, Sophitia decided that if she was to free her children from the evil sword's curse and ensure her sister's safety, she had to embark on a third journey. Because Cassandra had stolen Sophitia's previous weapons, which she had stored at Eurydice Shrine, Rothion forged her new set to destroy the cursed Soul Edge once and for all. Her journey took her to Ostrheinsburg Castle, where she encountered Tira. Tira told Sophitia that Soul Edge was not in the castle and threatened to kidnap Sophitia's children in order to set them up as sacrifices for Soul Edge. Sophitia therefore resolved to destroy Soul Edge for the sake of her children. Upon returning to Ostrheinsburg, she discovered Tira had made good on her word and abducted Pyrrha, who was kept alive, but left under Soul Edge's influence for so long that she could not survive if it were destroyed. Distraught, Sophitia then decided to protect the evil weapon, preventing anyone else who would try to destroy it so her daughter could be kept alive, going so far as to attack her younger sister, Cassandra when she arrived at Ostrheinsburg.
In the conclusion of "Soulcalibur IV", Soul Edge was destroyed for good by Siegfried despite of Sophitia's insistence to protect it. Because Pyrrha cannot live without the influence of Soul Edge, Sophitia decided to sacrifice herself by removing a shard of Soul Edge embedded near her heart to sustain Pyrrha's life. Tira had since raised Pyrrha in place of Sophitia and presumably also looted her weapons, the Omega Sword and Elk Shield for Pyrrha's use. Her death impacted many characters, including her husband, Rothion who tried to search for her and Pyrrha in the next seventeen years while hiding the reason of their absence from Patroklos, but ultimately had to tell the truth to him in his deathbed, sparking Patroklos' journey to find his sister and take revenge against Tira for apparently murdering his mother (though he does not know the true reason of her death). Elysium, the physical manifestation of Soul Calibur, takes form of Sophitia to further convince Patroklos to obey her orders.
Sophitia appears in the spin-off game "Soulcalibur Legends" as a playable character, set between the events of "Soul Edge" and "Soulcalibur". She will also be featured as a playable character in the free-to-play spin-off "Soulcalibur: Lost Swords". Outside of the Namco Bandai property, she made a guest appearance in the Tecmo Koei hack and slash game "Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate". According to that game's story, Sophitia was transported to Orochi's dimensional realm through time distortion during the events of "Soulcalibur IV". She meets Masanori Fukushima, Nene, and Sun Jian, who are part of the Coalition and want to recruit her. While Sophitia is in struggle to find a way to go back to her world so she could return to care her children, she decides to put aside her goal and join to provide help for the Coalition.
Yujin released a four inch tall immobile figurine of Sophitia as part of their "Namco Girls Series #3" line of figurines for gashapon. Other commercial items bearing Sophitia's likeness have also been released, such as a resin kit designed by Hiroshi Satou for manufacturer Kurushima.
Reception.
The character was very well received by the media and general public alike. Naming "Soul Edge" as the fourth top PlayStation game to date in 1997, "" wrote: "Favorite Moment: Finally figuring how to change the color of Sophitia's undies. Every fighting game should have this as an option." In a 2002 poll by Namco prior to the release of "Soul Calibur II" regarding their favorite character, Sophitia placed second with 18% of the tally, behind Seong Mi-na. WomenGamers.com praised her strength as a character in the series, noting "Sophitia is probably one of the most important and pivotal of all the seekers of the twin blades." Additional praise was given to her personality in contrast to more common anti-hero characters, as well as the realism of her fighting style approach, stating that all combined made her role in the game "uniquely positive." In 2003, GameSpy named her one of their top ten women in gaming at number five, stating Sophitia "became one of the most easily recognized characters in the series. She remains one of "Soul Caliber"s most memorable babes since the days of her swimsuit debut in "Soul Blade"." In 2007, she was listed by Tom's Games as one of the 50 greatest female characters in video game history, for being "a virtuous heroine who's as brave as she is cute." UGO.com placed her seventh in the 2008 list of top "Soul" series characters, describing her as "a regular little spitfire". That same year, "Chip" ranked her as the eight top "girl of gaming".
The 2004 book "Race, Gender, Media: Considering Diversity Across Audiences, Content, and Producers" used Sophitia as an example of most sexualized female characters in video games, describing her body and clothing as being created solely for the viewing pleasure of players, often males. GameDaily described her appearance as "angelic", adding "despite looking homelier than the other girls, is still jaw dropping"; she additionally ranked number five on their list of the "top 50 hottest game babes" as well as the same place on its "Top 25 Hottest Game Babes", and received mention and praise in similar articles for her character strength and evolution along the series. She placed 38th in UGO's 2011 list of top "videogame hotties", called "a force to be reckoned with in the "Soul Calibur" series." They also listed her as one of their list of "Fighting Games' Finest Female Fighters". "Maxim" named her as one of the hottest video game females of 2008, calling her "literally, the best thing since sliced bread." In 2011, GameFront ranked her breasts as the 36th "greatest boobs" in video game history, while PSU.com featured her among the sexiest PlayStation game characters, adding "Somebody say MILF?" "Complex" ranked her as the sixth best looking "sideline chick" in 2011, also including her on the list of ten "hot MILFs" in video games. In 2012, "Complex" ranked her as the eight "hottest" video game character, calling her "essentially a female Leonidas, by which we mean a gladiator with massive cleavage. We'd take watching her over Kurt Russell any day." In 2013, Scott Marley of "Daily Record" ranked her as the fourth most attractive female video game character, while Steve Jenkins of CheatCodes.com declared her the ninth "hottest video game girl" of all time.

Open-book accounting

Open-book accounting is an extension of the principles of Open-book management to include in an organisation's accounts all those with an interest in the organisation, not merely its employees and its shareholders (including those whose shareholding is managed indirectly, for example through a mutual fund). This effectively means all members of the public. 
Since almost all accounting records are now kept in electronic form, and since the computers on which they are held are universally connected, it should be possible for accounting records to be world-readable. 
This is an aspiration: at present, organisations run their accounts on systems secured behind firewalls and release of financial information by publicly quoted companies is carefully choreographed to ensure that it reaches all participants in the market equally. 
Advocates of open-book accounting argue that full transparency in accounting will lead to greater accountability and will help rebuild the trust in financial capitalism that has been so badly damaged by recent events such as the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the federal rescues of AIG, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the fire-sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America, not to mention earlier scandals such as the collapse of Enron and Worldcom.

Rectum

The rectum (from the Latin " ", meaning "straight intestine") is the final straight portion of the large intestine in some mammals, and the gut in others. The human rectum is about long, and begins at the rectosigmoid junction (the end of the sigmoid colon), at the level of the third sacral vertebra or the sacral promontory depending upon what definition is used. Its caliber is similar to that of the sigmoid colon at its commencement, but it is dilated near its termination, forming the rectal ampulla. It terminates at the level of the anorectal ring (the level of the puborectalis sling) or the dentate line, again depending upon which definition is used. In humans, the rectum is followed by the anal canal, before the gastrointestinal tract terminates at the anal verge.
Structure.
The rectum is a component of the lower gastrointestinal tract. The rectum is a continuation of the sigmoid colon, and connects to the anus. The rectum follows the shape of the sacrum, and ends in an expanded section called the "rectal ampulla". Unlike other portions of the colon, the rectum does not have taeniae coli. 
The rectum connects with the sigmoid colon at the level of S3, and connects with the anal canal as it passes through the pelvic floor muscles. 
Supports of the rectum include:
Function.
The rectum intestitium acts as a temporary storage site for feces. As the rectal walls expand due to the materials filling it from within, stretch receptors from the nervous system located in the rectal walls stimulate the desire to defecate. If the urge is not acted upon, the material in the rectum is often returned to the colon where more water is absorbed from the feces. If defecation is delayed for a prolonged period, constipation and hardened feces results.
When the rectum becomes full, the increase in intrarectal pressure forces the walls of the anal canal apart, allowing the fecal matter to enter the canal. The rectum shortens as material is forced into the anal canal and peristaltic waves propel the feces out of the rectum. The internal and external sphincter allow the feces to be passed by muscles pulling the anus up over the exiting feces.
Clinical relevance.
Examination.
For the diagnosis of certain ailments, a rectal exam may be done. These include faecal impaction, prostatic cancer and benign prostatic hypertrophy in men, faecal incontinence, and internal haemorrhoids. 
A colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy are forms of endoscopy that use a guided camera to view the rectum. These may have the ability to take biopsies if needed, and may be used to performed to diagnose diseases such as cancer.
Body temperature can also be taken in the rectum. Rectal temperature can be taken by inserting a medical thermometer not more than 25 mm (1 inch) into the rectum via the anus. A mercury thermometer should be inserted for 3 to 5 minutes; a digital thermometer should remain inserted until it beeps. Normal rectal temperature generally ranges from 36 to 38 °C (97.6 to 100.4 °F) and is about 0.5 °C (1 °F) above oral (mouth) temperature and about 1 °C (2 °F) above axilla (armpit) temperature.
Pediatricians recommend that parents take infants' and toddlers' temperature in the rectum for two reasons: 
In recent years, the introduction of non-invasive temperature taking methods including tympanic (ear) and forehead thermometers, and changing attitudes on privacy and modesty have led some parents and doctors to discontinue taking rectal temperatures.
Route of administration.
The rectum may also be used as a method to deliver drugs. This method is called a suppository.
Constipation.
One cause of constipation is faecal impaction in the rectum, in which a dry, hard stool fills the rectum. Manual evacuation is the use of a gloved finger to evacuate faeces from the rectum, and, after the application of stool softeners, is utilised in acute constipation. It is also in the long-term management of neurogenic bowel, seen most frequently in people with a spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis. Digital rectal stimulation, the insertion of one finger into the rectum, may be used to induce peristalsis in patients whose own peristaltic reflex is inadequate to fully empty the rectum.
Other disease.
Other diseases of the rectum include:
Society and culture.
Sexual stimulation.
Due to the proximity of the anterior wall of the rectum to the vagina in females or to the prostate in males and the shared nerves thereof, rectal stimulation or penetration can result in sexual arousal.

John Blanche

John Blanche is a British fantasy and science fiction illustrator and modeler known for his work for Games Workshop's White Dwarf magazine, Warhammer Fantasy Battle, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay and Warhammer 40,000 games and his role as art director for the company, including his work in the field of fantasy miniature painting, and for illustrations for various game book and Fighting Fantasy publications.
Early life.
Blanche was born into a working-class family in post-war England, and grew up on a Council estate during the 1950s, a period he describes as 'grey and flat', and lacking in the visual richness available to modern youth. Instead he took early inspiration from cinema, his collections of toy soldiers, and producing drawings of historic warriors on the backs of old rolls of wallpaper.
During the 1960s Blanche was exposed to art and art movements, eventually attending art college, where he entered a course on the strength of his drawings and paintings of battle scenes and prehistoric conflicts, and where he recounts that he was told he "had a romantic spirit, but it would never earn me a living, so there was no point in doing it".
After leaving college, Blanche spent time working as an assistant to a taxidermist in a Georgian manor-house, and worked on model building, drawing wildlife and painting fantastic scenes in his spare time.
Career.
After discovering published examples of fantasy art prevalent at the time, Blanche began preparing work for publication, eventually relocating to London and approaching artist and publisher Roger Dean. Dean provided him with the opportunity for freelance illustration work, and Blanche subsequently spent the late 70s and early 80s producing book covers and interior illustrations, including five illustrations for David Day's compendium, "A Tolkien Bestiary".
Also at around this time, during the late 1970s, Blanche became an avid collector of metal miniatures, and eventually of fantasy miniatures as these became available. In later years he would go on to contribute numerous articles to White Dwarf on the hobby, as well as contributing to and overseeing designs for miniatures, and receiving the Master Painter award for one of his own miniature pieces at the UK Games Day convention in 1987.
From 1977 Blanche became associated with Games Workshop, supplying the cover for issue 4 of their gaming publication White Dwarf, and producing the cover for the first British edition of "Dungeons & Dragons", for which the company possessed the UK licence, and in 1978 the magazine's first full-colour cover with issue 7. After 1979 he continued to produce work for the company, including further illustrations for the magazine and the box art for the first edition of Games Workshop's own Warhammer Fantasy Battle game in 1983.
After the company's move to Nottingham in 1986, Blanche was eventually made art director of Games Workshop through his acquaintance with new manager Bryan Ansell, directing the in-house art department, commissioning work from outside illustrators, and producing designs for Citadel Miniatures and artwork, and where he currently remains. He has overseen and contributed to regular art and miniature painting columns in White Dwarf for many years, as well as providing numerous illustrations for Games Workshop games, and, with other artists like Ian Miller and Adrian Smith, providing a formative contribution to the look of the companies core products.
In 1988 Blanche provided the cover for Notts thrash metal band Sabbat's album "History of a Time to Come", which featured his piece "Horned is the Hunter", with White Dwarf issue 95 including the band's Warhammer-inspired single "Blood for the Blood God" as a flexi-disc.
He is also known for his illustrations for fantasy gamebooks, including the Fighting Fantasy series, for which he produced cover and interior illustratons for Jackson's Sorcery! quartet and accompanying spellbook.
Blanche has had a number of books dedicated to his work published, including "The Prince and the Woodcutter", and "Ratspike" with fellow illustrator Ian Miller.
In recent years, following a period of poor health, he has focused more on working on sketchbooks relating to Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000, describing himself as "living in the worlds he has helped to create".
Style and technique.
Blanche is known for the dark, gothic, occasionally bizarre, punkish quality of his artwork, and this is something that has carried across onto the Games Workshop game worlds he has helped to shape. His images are, in the words of Patrick Woodroffe, of a style which "has as yet no name, no easy access, no fixed criteria. [...] Is it packaging? Is it comic-book art? Where does it fit? Roleplaying games, and all the paraphernalia that go with them, must still be unfamiliar to the average citizen of this land."
Blanche himself views his work as drawing on an archetypal core of inherited imagery:
Early in his career Blanche was influenced by turn-of-the-century illustrators such as Arthur Rackham and Kay Nielsen, and his exposure to the fantasy genre through writers like J.R.R.Tolkien. Favourite artists have included Rembrandt, Bosch, Dürer, Grünewald, Shishkin, the Pre-Raphaelites, Friedrich, Géricault and Gérôme, and the Victorian romanticists, as well as contemporary illustrators such as Jim Burns and Patrick Woodroffe, and he also cites everything from other media like film and comics, to everyday people and the natural world as sources of inspiration. Blanche has often incorporated images from other artists into his own work, with the Mona Lisa featuring in several pieces, an act he describes as "no mere plagiarism, but a deliberate policy. . . to place what is probably the worlds's best known painted image into a new reality." Others of his works have included elements of paintings by David and Géricault.
Interpretation, for Blanche, is literal, with an absence of intended messages or secret meanings; images are to be enjoyed for what they are, and he aims to draw the viewer to an appeciation of technique, colour, atmosphere, relationship of shapes, dynamics and characters, and the narrative quality of the image. One painting in particular, however, entitled "Amazonia Gothique", was something he cites as an effort to produce a deliberate comment:
The painting was used as the cover for White Dwarf 79, and later as a poster, and even formed the basis for a metal miniature, and went on to be voted best cover of the year in a magazine poll.
Blanche's early work tended to be executed using technical drawing pens combined with washes of water-colour, a technique that remained until the early 1980s, after which he began to utilise inks and acylics instead, using what he describes as a 'modeled painting technique' designed to mimic the oil painting methods of classical and romantic art. He has also, albeit very rarely, utilised oils. This glaze-based technique allows for undertones to shine through the overlaid colours giving the finished image an inner light effect, although this is predominantly lost in the reproduction process. Most of Blanche's paintings, with a few exceptions, are smaller than A4 in size. In executing work, he uses a variety of visual references ranging from friends posing for paintings, books, and collections of images from printed colour supplements. Each element of an image is constructed separately in a sketch pad, and planned on lay-out pads before being transferred to art board. This is then shaded in with a pencil and coloured using a limited selection of inks. Highlights and texture are added with white acrylic, and coloured washes and glazes are overlaid on top of this. Airbrushes are also used to fill in large areas like skies and to provide a smooth background for the image, and occasionally to add mists or atmosphere. Random elements are sometimes incorporated, the result of freely applied strokes, dripped pigment, and the use of the airbrush.

House of Bokassa

The House of Bokassa is an African royal and imperial house. Its founder ruled as emperor over the territories of the Central African Empire from 4 December 1976 to 21 September 1979, when he was overthrown.
Establishment and ruling history.
The House of Bokassa was created in 1976, when Jean-Bédel Bokassa, formerly authoritarian President of the Central African Republic, changed the name of the state and transformed it into a monarchy. Jean-Bédel Bokassa II was declared Crown Prince and heir to the imperial throne. The Emperor's sixth wife—he had a harem of nineteen, also after converting to Roman Catholicism—Catherine Denguiadé became "Her Imperial Majesty The Empress of Central Africa".
The ruling house was deposed along with Emperor Bokassa I when he was succeeded as head of state by David Dacko in 1979. Bokassa continued to consider himself the head of state in exile. Jean-Bédel Bokassa II is the current pretender to the Imperial Throne of Central Africa and the current head of the Imperial Family.
The Emperor was sentenced to death for murder in absentia. He later served a jail sentence in his home country, was pardoned and died of natural causes in 1996. 
Neither the US nor any European country acknowledged or supported the newly founded monarchy, with the exception of France whose President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing held close ties to Bokassa. By 1979, France had withdrawn its support as well. Pope Paul VI refused to take part in the coronation ceremony.
Ancestry.
The remotest known ancestor of the Imperial House was Dobogon Gbo Hosegoton Bokassa, a person possibly living in the 17th century. The Emperor Bokassa himself was the son of Mindogon Mbougdoulou, a tribal nobleman who reigned over their birthplace and who was married to Marie Yokowo. Further distant relatives most probably exist from the side of Bokassa's uncles, the other sons of his grandfather Mbalanga, who, excluding his father, totaled a grand number of 31.
Descent.
Bokassa I had 40 children by his 19 wives. Among these are:
Bokassa also adopted several children, three of which were Africans. One of these, however, was born in Vietnam as Martine Nguyễn Thị Bái and became Martine Bokassa upon her adoption.

Exhyalanthrax is a small genus of bombyliid flies. Bombyliids are commonly known as "bee flies" due to their resemblance to bees. "Exhyalanthrax" are found in the Afrotropical ecozone and the Palearctic ecozone. Exhyalanthrax spp. are pupal parasitoids."Exhyalanthrax afer" has been reared from pupae of tachinid and ichneumonid parasitoids of "Thaumetopoea pityocampa" and from the pupae of this species and other Lepidoptera. It has also been bred from cocoons of "Neodiprion sertifer". Several African species have been reared from the puparia of tsetse flies and from puparia of other Diptera. An "Exhyalanthrax" sp. has also been found preying on cockroach, ("Heterogamisca chopardi" Uvarov) oothecae in Saudi Arabia. It has been suggested that "Exhyalanthrax" might be utilised as 
biological control agents especially in the battle against tsetse flies.

WWE SmackDown vs. Raw Online

WWE SmackDown vs. Raw Online is a cancelled professional wrestling video game previously under development by Vertigo Games that was to be published by THQ for the PC.
History.
The project was to be the first "SmackDown vs. Raw" game ever on PC. It would have marked THQ's fourth game in development exclusively for the growing PC online market. It was promoted as part of the WWE SmackDown vs. Raw series. Though by May 2009 it was renamed "WWE Online" with ties to the series severed, at the E3 2010 event it was revealed to have been reverted.
On February 2, 2011, THQ held its quarterly earnings conference call and announced that the game was cancelled.
Gameplay.
With "WWE SmackDown. vs. Raw Online", players were to be able to connect with other players online to challenge them to a match, interact, or shop with them, which would have included buying each other's brands and wrestlers. The game was to feature both a single mode and a multiplayer one. The player could play as a WWE wrestler or create an original wrestler in search of fame, respect and virtual wealth, in order to reach the final rating for the Hall of Fame. The player would get points that would be used to unlock features, items and level ups. The player could also purchase additional items, abilities and clothing to improve their character.
The Create-a-Wrestler feature, which has been included in past WWE games, was to be implemented into this game. Players would be able to create their own wrestlers and use them in the game. This would include Create-a-Taunt, Create-a-Moveset, Create-an-Arena, Create-a-Finisher, Create-an-Entrance and a brand new 3D Paint Tool that would allow users to import .JPG, .GIF, .PNG, and .PSD files for use in the game.

Genesis of the Rubber Board.
Commercial cultivation of natural rubber was introduced in India by the British, although the experimental efforts to grow rubber on a commercial scale in India were initiated as early as 1873 at the Botanical Gardens, Calcutta. The first commercial Hevea plantations in India were established at Thattekadu in 1902. The importance of rubber production in India can a strategic and security reason had been realized by the government during the Second World War period. The rubber growers in India were encouraged to produce the maximum rubber required for the use during war. After the war, there were growing demands from the growers for setting up a permanent organisation to look after the interests of the industry. Thereupon the government set up an ad hoc committee in 1945 to study the situation and to make appropriate recommendation. On the recommendation of this ad hoc committee, the government passed the Rubber (Production and Marketing) Act, 1947, on 18 April 1947, and the Indian Rubber Board was constituted forthwith. The Rubber Production and Marketing (Amendment) Act, 1954, amended the name of the Board as The Rubber Board
Legislative Enactments on Rubber.
As noted above, a consideration of the post war natural rubber scenario prompted the Government of India to pass the Rubber (Production and Marketing) Act, 1947 to provide for the overall promotion and development of the sector under its guidance and control. As envisaged in the Act, the Indian Rubber Board was set up as the statutory organization responsible for assisting the government in implementation of the various provisions of the Act. The Act which came into force on 18 April 1947 has since undergone many amendments.
The Rubber production and Marketing (Amendment) Act of 1954 which took effect on 1 August 1954 made some important changes in the constitution of the Board now renamed as The Rubber Board. It clearly defined the role of the Board in the development of the industry and in formulating and implementing necessary research and development programmes. This was followed by notification of the Rubber Rules, 1955 laying down guidelines for the Board to follow in carrying out the purposes of the Act. The Rules have been subjected to need based amendments from time to time.
The Rubber (Amendment) Act of 1960 made certain alterations in the rate and procedure of collection of cess on rubber. The Rubber (Amendment) Act of 1982 provided for the Central Government to appoint a part-time or whole time Chairman for the Board and, if necessary, an Executive Director for exercising such powers and performing such duties as may be prescribed or delegated to him by the Chairman. The 1994 Amendment refixed the maximum rate of cess that can be levied on rubber.
Functions.
The functions of the Board as defined under the Act are:
1. to advise the Central Government on all matters relating to the development of the rubber industry, including the import and export of rubber.
2. to advise the Central Government with regard to participation in any international conference or scheme relating to rubber.
3. to submit to the Central Government and such other authorities as may be prescribed, half yearly reports on its activities and the working of this Act, and
4. to prepare and furnish such other reports relating to the rubber industry as may be required by the Central Government from time to time.
Departments and Divisions.
Sub Topics
Rubber Research Institute of India.
The Rubber Research Institute of India (RRII) established in 1955 is located on a hillock in the eastern suburb of Puthuppally, Kottayam, eight kilometres from the town. There are nine research disciplines, seven Regional Research Stations, two Hevean Breeding Sub-stations and a Central Experimental Station attached to the RRII. The Institute is headed by the Director (Research).
Major Divisions
Rubber Production Department.
The Department headed by the Rubber Production Commissioner is responsible for planning, formulation and implementation of schemes for improvement and expansion of rubber cultivation and production. Extension/advisory service, supplies of inputs, demonstration and training for small growers etc. are also undertaken by the RP Department.
There is a well structured field establishment set up under the Rubber Production Department which renders free advisory and extension services to rubber growers on all aspects of rubber cultivation, production, processing and marketing and simultaneously attends to implementation of various development schemes as well. The set up comprises four Zonal Offices, 44 Regional Offices and 191 Field Offices located at all important rubber growing centers. 
The Rubber Production Department formulates and implements all schemes relating to cultivation and production, most schemes relating to processing and the schemes for promoting and assisting small holders’ self-help groups.
The development strategy for natural rubber production has to keep in view the following essential requirements:
• Optimisation of production from existing plantations through replanting with improved cultivars and better agro management
• Expansion of cultivation in traditional plantation areas, identification of suitable non-traditional areas that are fit for economic production and extension of cultivation to such areas
• Reduction of cost of production to withstand challenges from competing crops, synthetic substitutes and cheap imports
• Upgradation of quality of produce to meet the increasingly exacting demands of consuming industries
• Formation and effective working of small holders’ self-help groups to ensure informed community participation to create infrastructure to facilitate organised production, processing and marketing chains to gain maximum returns. The approach also takes care of the needs of the resource poor farmers who also got an opportunity not only to derive benefits offered under various schemes but to contribute to the decision making process.
The important development schemes and activities undertaken through the Department are the following:
The central office of the Department functions at the Board's central office in Kottayam. The field services are rendered through Zonal/Regional offices and Field Offices. Other establishments are nurseries, demonstration and training centers and tappers training schools.

Senapati

Senapati (Sanskrit: "sena-" meaning "army", "-pati" meaning "lord") was a hereditary title of nobility used in the Maratha Empire. During wartime, a "Sardar Senapati" or "Sarsenapati" (also colloquially termed "Sarnaubat") functioned as the Commander-in-Chief of all Maratha forces, coordinating the commands of the various "Sardars" in battle.
Ranking under the heir-apparent crown prince and other hereditary princes, the title "Senapati" most closely resembles a British Duke or German "Herzog" in rank and function. On occasion, the title "Mahasenapati" (Sanskrit: "maha-" meaning "great") was granted; this best equates to a Grand Duke or a German "Großherzog".
Unlike "Sardar", "Senapati" is a primogeniture hereditary title that passes on to the eldest son. There are several royal "Senapati" families alive today, including the Ghorpade and Dabhade families.

Croome collection

The Croome collection – the archive of the Earls of Coventry – came into public ownership in 2005 as part of the Acceptance in Lieu of Inheritance Tax Scheme, whereby the nation accepts valuable assets to set against tax liabilities. In 2006, after making a case to the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) for housing the collection, Worcestershire Record Office was identified as its new permanent home. A project is currently underway to catalogue the collection according to the International Standard for Archival Description (ISAD(G), making it fully accessible to the public for the first time.
The Croome Collection takes its name from Croome Court in Croome D’Abitot, Worcestershire, the seat of the Coventry family from the 1592 until 1948. It is an internationally significant archive that has been created over hundreds of years by the Coventry family and their estate. The archive includes substantial runs of papers relating to the estates of the family, including plans, rentals, deeds and correspondence. It also includes unique records relating to the building, decoration and furnishing of Croome Court and the creation and development of the parkland surrounding it, which was Lancelot "Capability" Brown’s first complete landscape work. 
__TOC__
History.
Prior to the transfer of the collection to Worcestershire Record Office, the collection was stored for many years at the Coventry family home of Croome Court. In 1938 part of the collection was sent to Birmingham Reference Library on permanent loan by permission of George William, 10th Earl of Coventry. Around 25,000 documents were sent to the Library, including the official papers of Sir Thomas Coventry, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England. Although it was the intention that the collection would be worked upon whilst there, the intervening years of World War II led to a severe staff shortage, meaning the work was stalled until after the end of the war. 
In 1948 work began to catalogue the official papers of Lord Keeper Thomas Coventry. This was completed in 1950. Four boxes of deeds from the collection were also catalogued. Although attempts were made by Birmingham Reference Library to attain the other existing parts of the Croome collection, in 1950 the Trustees of the Croome Estate requested that the material be returned to the estate office. The collection was returned to the Croome Estate Trust on 28 February 1950, although Birmingham Reference Library retained the papers of Lord Keeper Coventry and the four boxes of catalogued deeds.
During the 1950s Lt. Col. O.D. Smith, D.L. J.P., Agent and Managing Trustee of the Croome Estate Trust worked on the arrangement of the archive, sorting it into 3 main sections: family papers (personal correspondence of family members, diaries, photographs, recipe books and the bills and accounts relating to the building and landscaping of the Court and park), estate management papers (rentals, accounts, estate diaries, wage books and papers relating to the running of the estate) and parish boxes (title deeds, leases, manorial documents etc.). During the 1980s work was done on the collection, storing it in archival quality boxes and creating box lists to help navigation around the collection. The collection remained in this order until its transfer to Worcestershire Record Office in November 2006. 
The archive was professionally valued and upon consideration that it met the third criterion of the Acceptance in Lieu Scheme, that is to say that it is of ‘of especial importance for the study of some particular branch of art, learning or history’, the collection was accepted to settle £436,854 of tax. An invitation was put out to tender for interested bodies that may wish to house the collection. Because the information contained within the collection is integral to Worcestershire history, Worcestershire Record Office expressed great interest in the collection and was granted permanent allocation of the collection. On 9 November 2006 the collection was transferred from the Croome estate office to Worcestershire Record Office. The collection held at Worcestershire Record Office covers the estate archive up to the year 1921, the year that the estate was placed in the hands of the Croome Estate Trust. Records created after this date remain with the Croome Estate Trust.
The Coventry family.
The Croome collection is the family and estate archive of the Earls of Coventry. Before they were given the title of the Earl of Coventry on 26 April 1697 the family held the title of Baron of Allesborough. The Barony died out with the death of Gilbert Coventry in 1719, as he left no male issue. The Earldom still survives today. 
The key members of the Coventry family who created the archives are:

Hello Beautiful

Hello Beautiful is a Canadian band from Whitby. They are known primarily for their hybrid sound of pop-rock and hip hop. They were formed by vocalist/guitarist Cole Kidd and drummer Kevin Walsh, who were later joined by vocalist Charlie Royal. They are currently in the studio recording new tracks, which have been compared to a mixture of Fun. with Macklemore & Ryan Lewis.
Hello Beautiful really knows how to ignite an audience, as noted by Toronto's Exclaim Magazine; ""Their set caused a dance floor eruption and a constant interchange between the crowd and band made for an endearing set. HB got enough love from the crowd to play an encore and left the stage while the raged."" (Recently Reviewed, Exclaim Magazine, Nov/08). During the aftermath of a show at Toronto's legendary live venue, The Horseshoe Tavern, the establishment’s co-owner, Jeff Cohen said ""The last time I saw someone play like that on this stage, it was Billy Talent, and that was like four years ago!"".
While some bands have blended genres before, none have created this particular blend of Punk, Hip Hop and Pop Rock, in essence creating their style of popular music. This unique dynamic is easily noticed on their full-length debut, "Soundtrack For Scenario", which has received high praise: ""Sheer noise can result from fusing Hip Hop, Rock and Punk instead of a euphonic harmony"" however, ""Hello Beautiful have managed to successfully mix the three types of music into one"" (ChartAttack.com Aug/08). After having two singles, "Virginia Symphony" and "Saint Andrew's Bridge", in MuchMusic’s Top 5, performances on MTV and Breakfast Television, and ample national touring experience (supporting such acts as; Hedley, Snoop Dogg, illScarlett, Akon, Alexisonfire, Down With Webster, etc. along the way), the quintet with the relentless work ethic headed into the legendary Vespa Studio to record their second album. Produced by International music industry veterans; Harry Hess and Eric Ratz (Billy Talent, Cancer Bats, Muse), Hello Beautiful created a hard-hitting 10-track album - still based on their impressive fusion, but full of new twists.
Soundtrack for Scenario.
In late April 2007, Hello Beautiful recorded their full-length debut, "Soundtrack for Scenario", with the help of Canadian music industry veteran, Murray Daigle. The album was subsequently released a year later through a distribution deal with the independent label Bent Penny Records via the distribution company, Fontana North. Two singles were released from "Soundtrack for Scenario", "Virginia Symphony", and "Saint Andrew's Bridge". Due to large fan support via request lines and internet media, the first single, "Virginia Symphony", was in heavy rotation on MuchMusic for the summer/early fall of 2008, and peaked at No. 2 on Much On Demand’s Daily Top 10. Their second video, "Saint Andrew's Bridge", peaked at No. 5. Hello Beautiful was the only unsigned artist to chart that year, while all other charting artists were affiliated with a major and/or major independent label.
I Wanna Die Like This!
In Winter 2009/10, Hello Beautiful recorded a new album titled "I Wanna Die Like This!". Tracks include "Black & White", "Tick Tock", "Heart Beats" and "Some Days" - which received radio airplay and is garnered significant attention. This album is more rock based, but also has some powerful piano driven songs - which differs from the last album's base of blues and funk.

Kenmare GAA (Irish: ) is a Gaelic Athletic Association club from Kenmare in County Kerry.
The club competes as a joint divisional side with other clubs from the Kenmare area like Templenoe GAA in the county championship and as an individual club in other competitions.
History.
The Kenmare Athletic Club was founded on 25 September 1888 when they held a meeting with the newly formed GAA.

Hurling
They played in the 1889 Munster Senior Hurling Championship final as Kerry rep
Hurling used to be the dominant game in the Roughty River valley as indicated by the fact that on St. Patrick's Day in 1858 a game of hurling was played between two games called "Kenmare Guards" in Hoboken, New Jersey, USA.
Kenmare also won the first Kerry Senior Hurling Championship on 19 May 1889 versus Kilmoyley GAA.
In 1895 Kenmare were in another hurling final but this time lost to Kilmoyley GAA.
They won the 1902 County Hurling final against Tralee Celtic, lost the 1904 final to the same team and then won in 1916 and lost the final in 1917. Kenmare's last hurling County title was won in 1942 although they did reach the final 4 more times in 1943, '45, '47 and 1991.
In 1983 & and 1988 Kenmare won the County Minor Championship and lost the 1986 final to Austin Stacks. In 1984 and 1992 All Ireland Hurling Féile na nGael titles were won.

In 1972 & 1983 Kenmare represented Kerry in the Munster Senior Club Football Championship and on each occasion were narrowly beaten by the club championship specialists Nemo Rangers from Cork
The 1980s proved to be an era for under age successes at football with many Co. competitions being won. U21 Football and a host of other under age hurling and football titles came our way. In 1982 the Club won an All Ireland Minor Football competition.
The club colours today are red & black and these were adopted in the late 1960s; the previous colours being blue & gold. The Club's home ground is Father Breen Park and it has two playing fields with a new synthetic training ground being developed. A new sports hall has also been completed and this should add to the promotion of hurling as indoor hurling has contributed hugely to the present day position of hurling in the greater Kenmare area.

At the beginning, Hall and Oates are discovered in their cozy apartment by someone on the roof, looking through a skylight. The man throws a V-style guitar through the window, as if it were a spear. The guitar sticks into the floor and then begins glowing. This incites Hall and Oates to go up to the roof to investigate. There, on the roof of the apartment, they become mesmerized by a four man band, and then all the men perform a choreography. While performing Daryl Hall falls from the roof, and the other men rush to see what became of him. There, they see him dancing on the clouds next to the moon, and upon Halls' beckoning, they dive off the roof in an attempt to walk on the clouds. At the end, they are seen swimming and dancing in the clouds, with neon signs flashing the letters of the song title. 
The version of the song used in the video is a special edit, which incorporates both the album version and the 12" remix version.
In popular culture.
In 1985, "Weird Al" Yankovic included the song in his polka medley "Hooked on Polkas" from his album "Dare to Be Stupid".

Arínzano

Señorío de Arínzano is one of ten "Vino de Pago" that exist in Spain as of 2009. This is the highest category on the quality scale of Spanish wines and means that in addition to having a proven track record of consistent quality, the wines have to be both produced from estate-grown grapes and also have to be processed and aged in a winery ("bodega") located on the estate. This Vino de Pago is located in the municipality of Aberin (Merindad de Estella), in the Foral Community of Navarra, Spain). The estate was purchased by the Chivite family in 1988 and is operated by Bodegas Chivite.

Barry Stobart

Barry Henry Stobart (6 June 1938 – 28 August 2013) was an English footballer who played in the Football League as a forward for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Manchester City, Aston Villa and Shrewsbury Town during the 1960s.
Career.
Stobart began his football career at Wath Wanderers, the Yorkshire-based nursery club of Wolverhampton Wanderers, before heading south in 1953 to join them, turning professional in 1955.
With the likes of Peter Broadbent, Dennis Wilshaw and Jimmy Murray already established in the forward line, Stobart was consigned to the reserves in his early years. He finally made his first team debut on 5 March 1960, when he scored in a 2–0 win at Manchester United.
Although he made just four league appearances prior to the 1960 FA Cup Final, his performance in the final league game at Chelsea saw him earn a surprise place in the Cup Final team, at the expense of Bobby Mason. This allowed Stobart to collect the only medal of his career, as Wolves defeated Blackburn 3–0 in the Wembley showpiece. Barry Stobart was given the nickname "Kangaroo Kid" due to his unique ability to jump and score many goals via headers.
The following two seasons saw him only appear occasionally for the first team, and it wasn't until the 1962–63 campaign that he enjoyed a lengthy run in the side, during which he scored 14 goals. The next year saw him again largely relegated to the reserves though, and he left Molineux to join Manchester City in summer 1964.
He failed to settle at Maine Road, and returned to the Midlands within months when he joined Aston Villa in November 1964 for £22,000. He remained at Villa for three years, his best season coming in 1966–67 when he scored 11 times from 20 appearances. He dropped down the divisions in October 1967 to join Shrewsbury Town of the Third Division in a £10,000 deal. After a spell with them, he moved to South Africa to play out his career with Durban Spurs.
His eldest son Sean Stobart was a professional footballer a Scunthorpe United scoring on his first team debut against Rochdale FC.
His youngest son Loy was later also on the professional books at Wolverhampton Wanderers during the early 1990s having signed from Nottingham Forrest on a free transfer. He also played for Cheltenham Town FC and Bidvest Witts in South Africa.
Post Football.
Barry went on to coach Willenhall Town FC to an FA vase final in 1981 at Wembley and guided semi-pro footballers, John Muir, Brendan Hackett and Russell Bradley to professional careers in Football. After retirement he worked as a greengrocer and finally as a window cleaner in the Sedgley area.
Vascular dementia.
In 2005 it was revealed that Stobart suffered from vascular dementia and resided in a care home from 2009.

PowerDVD

CyberLink PowerDVD is a media player for Microsoft Windows providing DVD playback, with Blu-ray playback available in higher editions. The current version, PowerDVD 13, is available in three editions: PowerDVD 13 Deluxe (DVD only), PowerDVD 13 Pro (Blu-ray playback) or PowerDVD 13 Ultra (Blu-ray 3D playback).
PowerDVD is distributed on physical media or by download from the CyberLink website. It is often bundled with a variety of PC systems and peripheral devices (particularly optical drives) a strategy which has enabled CyberLink to claim it as "the market's #1 media playback product with annual distribution of over 100 million units".
PowerDVD was the first Blu-ray 3D software player to achieve certification from the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) under the new Blu-ray 3D standard (Profile 5.0).
Limitations.
To watch Blu-ray in PowerDVD 11 or above, the user's computer must be HDCP compliant, with an appropriate videocard, cable and monitor; there is no such limitation on version 10 and earlier releases, and so VGA, composite or S-Video interfaces can be used to connect monitor or TV to PC. When installed on laptops, this limitation doesn't apply, but newer Blu-ray protected discs can be played only in more recent versions and most of the time need an Internet connection to do so.
HD DVD support is not available since PowerDVD 9.
Criticism.
CyberLink supports PowerDVD with updates for a limited time after a version is released, which became a problem once Blu-ray Disc support was included with the release of PowerDVD 7 Ultra in December 2009: Blu-ray copy protection requires player software or firmware to be updated periodically to allow playback of newer discs. For CyberLink customers wanting to watch a Blu-ray Disc mastered after the date on which their version of PowerDVD went EOL, this means they might be unable to do so until they have upgraded to a newer release of PowerDVD. Since version 9, the software provides notification if an unplayable disc is inserted: users with a version still in support are prompted by this notification to update to the latest patch, those with a version that is EOL are prompted to upgrade to the current release and on clicking are taken to the CyberLink website to buy a copy of the current version at a discount.
Versions 7 Ultra, 8 and 9 were updated for only 12, 24 and 26 months respectively, and this requirement to buy a new PowerDVD release every other year for continued Blu-ray capability led to many complaints about incompatibility from users of PowerDVD 9 and earlier when Star Wars was first released on Blu-ray. Subsequently, versions 10 and 11 have continued to receive updates for longer than the previous three versions did.
DVD Audio support is not available in version 11. Support stopped during version 9, although Cyberlink advertised versions 9 and 10 as being able to play DVD Audio discs. Cyberlink has refused to offer assistance to customers who bought versions 10 and 11 believing they could play back DVD Audio discs using them.
For users with international disks, PowerDVD does not have an option to set preferred languages or disk menus. This causes serious issues with Japanese Blu-ray disks of international titles, as PowerDVD often ignores the Japanese menus in favor of the primary (non-Japanese) menu. There is no fix offered by Cyberlink other than to switch versions to a Japanese one.

On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae

On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae is an 1809 paper on the Proteaceae family of flowering plants. Although nominally written by Joseph Knight as a paper on cultivation techniques, all but 13 pages consists of an unattributed taxonomic revision now known to have been written by Richard Salisbury.
Publication of the paper triggered one of the most bitter disputes in 19th century botany, because Salisbury had preempted the publication of numerous plant names that Robert Brown had intended to publish. Brown's paper had already been read to the Linnean Society of London, at meeting which Salisbury had attended, but his paper had not yet made it to print. In publishing this paper before Brown's "On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae" had been printed, Salisbury beat Brown to print, claiming priority for the names that Brown had authored. As a result of this, Salisbury was accused of plagiarism and ostracised from botanical circles. Contemporary notes and letter indicate widespread condemnation of Salisbury's actions. For example, Samuel Goodenough wrote "How shocked was I to see Salisbury's surreptitious anticipation of Brown's paper on new Holland plants, under the name and disguise of Mr. Hibbert's gardener! Oh it is too bad!"; and James Edward Smith wrote that he had a copy of Knight's paper "but shall not keep it — I mean hereafter not to notice it or any other of the author's productions." Brown himself wrote of Salisbury "I scarcely know what to think of him except that he stands between a rogue and a fool."
Initially, Salisbury's names were ignored in favour of Brown's names. When the conservation of generic names was introduced in the 1900s, Brown's genera were formally conserved. However it was not possible to conserve species names until the 1980s, by which time the priority of Salisbury's species names had long been accepted. Thus "On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae" is the source of numerous names of Proteaceae taxa.

Opuntia repens

Opuntia repens is a species of cactus that is native to dry forests Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. It is a small shrub, growing up to 50 cm (20 in) tall, with yellow flowers and red fruit. Like its cousins, "jumping cholla" "Opuntias" of the Mojave, Sonoran, and Colorado deserts, it propagates by a segment dislodging after spines are caught in a large mammal's fur, whereby the segment is transported to another location. This is in addition to propagation by seed.

Kaahin Kissii Roz (translation: "Somewhere, Someday") was an Indian thriller drama television series that broadcast on STAR Plus from April 2001 until September 2004. The series was one of the top rated shows of its time.
Plot.
The Past
Shaina marries Kunal Sikand and enters the rich high profile Sikand Family. After marriage the entire family, including Shaina, is haunted by the spirit of a woman who usually leaves a red cloth around. The spirit is revealed to be of Kunal's ex-wife Sunaina, who died mysteriously 4 years ago. In a twist, it is revealed that Shaina is in fact Sunaina, who had plastic surgery. She married Kunal to take revenge as she thinks he tried to kill her. Kunal is then revealed to have been innocent all along. It was in fact her mother-in-law, Ramola Sikand, who tried to kill Sunaina. Thus a cold war begins between Ramola and Shaina. 
Kunal's stepbrother Anish, who is Ramola's son, is married to Nisha and is cold towards Shaina. Kunal's youngest stepbrother Nakul is engaged to Surbhi. She commits suicide after finding out about her pregnancy and Nakul leaves the country. Natasha, Avantika and Malvika are the Sikand daughters and sisters of Kunal, Anish and Nakul. They get married and move out of Sikand household. Nakul eventually returns and marries Sunidhi. Natasha divorces her husband Aman and marries Akash.
Shaina digs out Ramola's past life and finds Kunal's real mother is actually Nirupa. She is in an asylum. Ramola gave drugs to make Nirupa mentally ill and then tricked Kunal's father into marrying her to get his entire property. Shaina brings Nirupa home and starts taking care of her and makes her well but frustrates Ramola in the process. Ramola decides to take revenge and kills Kunal by pushing a breakfree car towards him. Ramola brings Kunal's look-alike, Kuljeet, from Haryana to replace Kunal in the Sikand household and the business. Kunal, who has managed to survive, loses his memory and ends up joining a criminal organisation renaming himself Shaan. Shaan and his cohorts find Kuljeet in a temple and kidnap him so that Shaan can enter the Sikand household. Kunal enters the Sikand family and gradually regains his memory and joins forces with Shaina to destroy Ramola. 
Kuljeet was deeply in love with Sikand family, especially Shaina, so he tried his best to prove Kunal wrong. Finally Kunal proves that he is the real Kunal and Kuljeet returns to Haryana. Ramola and Kunal compromise by hiding each other's sins, Ramola trying to kill Kunal and Kunal being Shaan, a Criminal.
Maansi - Like Face of Shaina
Karan Seth enters the Sikand Household and claims Shaina is actually Maansi. The fact is, when Sunaina was burnt, she lived with her burnt face for one year and then met Maansi. They were traveling together and met an accident. Maansi was killed in the accident, and mistakenly Sunaina's face was changed to Maansi's face, the present face of Shaina. Kunal loses his faith on Shaina and he believes she is Maansi. Shaina had made a will stating the property would go to a trust if she and Kunal died. Karan Seth was paid by Ramola Sikand to prove that Shaina was Maansi, so that the will was nullified. Karan wanted Maansi's property that she had left to Baba. He kills Baba and proves Kunal guilty of it. Kunal realizes that Shaina is truthful and is not Maansi. Shaina plays Maansi's role to trap Karan and Ramola and to save Kunal. She creates misunderstandings between Karan and Ramola and so Kunal is saved.
Kunal and Shaina Jailed
Ramola brings her criminal brother Ratan and sets up Shaina and Kunal. They are sent to jail for fraud. Kuljeet helps Kunal and Shaina escape from jail and tries to find a way to prove them innocent. Ramola tries her best to find them and hand them over to the police but she fails. Eventually, she finds them hiding in a farmhouse. She sets the farmhouse on fire. Everyone thinks Kunal and Shaina are dead but they have survived and they start haunting Ramola, pretending to ghosts. Ramola gets mentally disturbed and is admitted to a mental asylum. 
The Revenge
When everything is revealed about Ramola and things begin to settle, Dhananjay(DJ) and his family enter their lives. Years ago Ramola cheated DJ of his inheritance of Sikand property and he is back to take revenge on Ramola. DJ tries to shoot Ramola, but by mistake the bullet hits his own daughter, Devika. DJ and his wife Avanti gets frustrated so they decide to kill the whole Sikand family by planting a bomb. Nakul and Sunidhi dies in the blast and Ramola and Shaina vow revenge on DJ. It is only four years later that DJ finds Kunal still alive. DJ goes after him and creates a lot of destruction in the Sikands' lives. Ramola and Shaina come together to defeat DJ. The Sikands use the alias of Sengupta. Each of them is given their new identity for security purposes. After a long war, Ramola and Shaina succeeds in killing DJ. As DJ takes his last breath, he shoots Ramola in the back. This leaves her paralyzed and she is confined to a wheel chair.
Destruction
Kunal and Shaina are finally convinced that Ramola has changed and is no longer evil. The cold war between Shaina and Nisha begins due to the lack of money in the family account. Somebody tries to kill Shaina, so she blames Anish and Nisha for all mishaps that happened with her. A witch appears everyday and threatens Shaina, new shadows appear and scare her. Shaina insults Anish and Nisha everyday and Kunal gets angry with all the family problems and somebody tries to prove Shaina is mentally ill. Somebody shoots Anish and he goes into coma and Shaina is blamed for that and is jailed. Ramola helps Shaina to escape from jail but in a twist it is revealed that Ramola was behind all the incidents that happened with Shaina. The bullet that hit Anish was meant for Shaina but Anish saw the hitman and in order to protect Shaina he got shot himself. Since Anish is in coma he is unable to reveal anything. Shaina eventually realizes that it was all along Ramola's doing. Nisha is revealed to be under Ramola's influence in killing Shaina. However after Anish is shot face off Nisha constantly threatens Ramola that she will expose her. Roamola kills Nisha and Shaina is blamed and sent to jail.
Anish recovers and reveals Shaina to be innocent. Ramola then creates a false affair between Vikram and Shaina. Kunal misunderstands Shaina and cannot hold himself anymore. Ramola brings Shalini into the picture to win all hearts in the family and marry Kunal. When she fails, Shalini undergoes plastic surgery and gets Sunaina's (Shaina's previous) face. Shaina fails in all her steps to defeat Ramola. A battle ensues among Shaina (real Sunaina), Shalini (fake Shalini naina) and Ramola which results in the death of remaining family members - Anish, Natasha and Avantika. Finally Ramola succeeds in killing Shaina and Kunal along with their two children. Thus Ramola is left alone, with almost her entire family dead. The only survivors of the family besides Ramola are Nirupa, Anish and Nisha's daughter, Nisha's mother and two children of Ratan (whom Ramola adopts).
The Next Generation
For the next 20 years Ramola lives a peaceful life raising Ratan's children Rashi Nisha and Anish Apoorva as her own. Shaina Sikand is re-incarnated as Devika who lives with her father and aunt. She has always had nightmares of someone trying to kill her. When Ramola comes to know about Devika she is shocked to see the same face but Devika does not remember anything of her past life. Kunal Sikand is re-incarnated as Nikhil who is born into a poor family. In the temple Devika sees Nikhil and faints. She is taken to a hospital but Nikhil takes her from there to their old farm house. Devika wakes up and remembers everything. Nikhil and Devika decide to get married. At the farmhouse Devika is alone as Nikhil is out. Devika sees a red cloth on a tree and as she goes to take it she finds Ramola's brother Ratan on top of the tree. He throws kerosene on her and burns her alive. After Devika's death Nikhil seeks revenge from Ramola and he takes over as company manager of the Sikand group of industries. Rashi, Apoorva and Nirupa turn against Ramola when they learn the truth of what she did with her family. Ramola is trapped from all sides but she disappears and everyone believes her to be dead. Shaina’s spirit, after two lives, is unable find peace and wanders around restlessly in a bid to take revenge from Ramola. The spirit enters into Anisha (Shweta Salve). Nikhil and Anisha later get married.
Showdown
Ramola goes psychotic and kills a couple of inspectors when they try to arrest her. She also kills Nirupa Sikand by pushing her out of the window at an old house. Lastly, Ramola is killed by Nikhil when he shoots her with a gun. Thus Kunal and Shaina extract their revenge.

Greenlight Capital

Greenlight Capital is a hedge fund founded by David Einhorn. Greenlight invests primarily in publicly traded North American corporate debt offerings and equities. Greenlight is most notable for its short selling of Lehman stock prior to Lehman Brothers' collapse in 2008. 
Founded in 1996 with $900,000 (half borrowed from Einhorn's parents), Greenlight has generated greater than a twenty-five percent annualized net return for its investors. It prospered in its early days by identifying weak financial firms for short selling, making significant gains from Conseco, CompuCredit, Sirrom Capital, and Resource America. It also manages a fund of funds and a private equity fund through its affiliates, Greenlight Masters and Greenlight Private Equity Partners. It also operates Greenlight Capital Re, a property/casualty reinsurer. Unlike other funds, Greenlight does not use borrowed money, or leverage. The firm does not generate large trading volumes.
In June 2008 there were 25 employees, including 9 analysts and 1 trader. It occupies a single high floor of an office building near Grand Central, in New York.
A few months before the dot-com bust, Greenlight lost 4% of its total capital on a short on Chemdex stock as it soared in price. A few months after Greenlight closed its position, Chemdex stock plunged to $2.
In the third quarter of 2008, Greenlight lost 15% of its value, primarily from long positions on industrial companies like Helix Energy Solutions, as the SEC temporarily banning short selling of financial stocks. With the majority of Greenlight's money in bonds and long positions on stocks, this stopped hedge funds minimizing 'long' losses or offsetting them with short gains. Greenlight ended 2008 down 23%, its first annual loss. In 2009 Greenlight recouped its losses from 2008.
Einhorn and Greenlight Capital were fined by the FSA for insider trading on the 25 January 2012. 
Top equity holdings.
As of 2013, the top equity holdings of the firm were in the shares of the following companies: Apple Inc, General Motors, Marvell Technology Group, CIGNA, Aetna, Computer Sciences, Delphi Automotive, NCR Corp., and Virgin Media.

Slavskoye, Russia

Slavskoye (; ; ) is a settlement in the Bagrationovsky District, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia, located south of Kaliningrad.
History.
In 1240, the Teutonic Knights founded a castle (Creutzburg / Kreuzburg, cross castle) in the region of Natangia at the location of an Old Prussians settlement. In 1315 Kreuzburg received its town privileges. Throughout the Hunger War in 1414, 71 houses were destroyed and five citizens were killed by the Polish troops. Kreuzburg also suffered heavy damages in the Thirteen Years' War of 1454-1466 and the Polish-Teutonic War of 1519–1521.
After the secularization of the Teutonic Knights in 1525, Kreuzburg became part of the Duchy of Prussia and the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. It was badly affected by the Napoleonic Battle of Eylau in February 1807 and almost totally destroyed by a fire catastrophe on May 10, 1818, when 152 buildings burned down. Only the church, the vicarage, and the schoolhouse were not affected. Due to that disaster the regional administration was transferred to Preußisch Eylau.
Kreuzburg was connected to the railway-system in 1908.
Throughout the Soviet East Prussian Offensive in February 1945 Kreuzburg was again largely destroyed and transferred from Germany to the Soviet Union according to the 1945 Potsdam Conference. Its German population was expelled, and the name was changed from Kreuzburg to Slavskoye.

Gyrokinetics

Gyrokinetics is a theoretical framework to study plasma behavior on perpendicular spatial scales comparable to the gyroradius and timescales much slower than the particle cyclotron frequencies. 
These particular scales have been experimentally shown to be appropriate for modeling plasma turbulence. The trajectory of charged particles in a magnetic field is a helix that winds around the field line. This trajectory can be decomposed into a relatively slow motion of the guiding center along the field line and a fast circular motion, called gyromotion. For most plasma behavior, this gyromotion is irrelevant. Averaging over this gyromotion reduces the equations to six dimensions (3 spatial, 2 velocity, and time) rather than the seven (3 spatial, 3 velocity, and time). Because of this simplification, gyrokinetics governs the evolution of charged rings with a guiding center position, instead of gyrating charged particles.
Derivation of the gyrokinetic equation.
Fundamentally, the gyrokinetic model assumes the plasma is strongly magnetized ( formula_1 ), the perpendicular spatial scales are comparable to the gyroradius ( formula_2 ), and the behavior of interest has low frequencies ( formula_3 ). We must also expand the distribution function, formula_4, and assume the perturbation is small compared to the background (formula_5). The starting point is the Fokker–Planck equation and Maxwell's equations. The first step is to change spatial variables from the particle position formula_6 to the guiding center position formula_7. Then, we change velocity coordinates from formula_8 to the velocity parallel formula_9, the magnetic moment formula_10, and the gyrophase angle formula_11. Here parallel and perpendicular are relative to formula_12, the direction of the magnetic field, and formula_13 is the mass of the particle. Now, we can average over the gyrophase angle at constant guiding center position, denoted by formula_14, yielding the gyrokinetic equation.
The electrostatic gyrokinetic equation, in the absence of large plasma flow, is given by
formula_15.
Here the first term represents the change in the perturbed distribution function, formula_16, with time. The second term represents particle streaming along the magnetic field line. The third term contains the effects of cross-field particle drifts, including the curvature drift, the grad-B drift, and the lowest order E-cross-B drift. The fourth term represents the nonlinear effect of the perturbed formula_17 drift interacting with the distribution function perturbation. The fifth term uses a collision operator to include the effects of collisions between particles. The sixth term represents the Maxwell–Boltzmann response to the perturbed electric potential. The last term includes temperature and density gradients of the background distribution function, which drive the perturbation. These gradients are only significant in the direction across flux surfaces, parameterized by formula_18, the magnetic flux.
The gyrokinetic equation, together with gyro-averaged Maxwell's equations, give the distribution function and the perturbed electric and magnetic fields. In the electrostatic case we only require Gauss's law (which takes the form of the quasineutrality condition), given by
formula_19.
Usually solutions are found numerically with the help of supercomputers, but in simplified situations analytic solutions are possible.

Native American civil rights

Native American civil rights are the civil rights of Native Americans in the United States.
Although indigenous to the Americas, American Indians became one of many minorities and the movement for American Indian civil rights began almost as soon as Europeans started to arrive in the Western Hemisphere. Following the establishment of the United States of America, Native Americans were denied basic civil rights for many years. While American Indians did not have a particular period of fighting for their civil rights like the African American Civil Rights Movement, measures have been taken to achieve equal rights for American Indians throughout history.
Because American Indians are citizens of their tribal nations as well as the United States, and those tribal nations are characterized under U.S. law as "domestic dependent nations", a special relationship exists which creates a particular tension between rights granted via tribal sovereignty and rights that individual Indians retain as U.S. citizens. Although this is not true in California for one Tribe, the Kawaiisu Tribe of Tejon. They signed a Treaty with the United States on Dec. 30, 1849 which was ratified on Sept. 9, 1850. They were held as property (Slaves) and sold as such under the California Law for the protection of California Indians 1850, amended 1860. Citizenship was not given until 1957, under the California law of voting rights. To this day, the United States has not upheld her Treaty with them. The Kawaiisu rights under the Treaty are Hunting and Fishing, Land was never ceded, Mineral Rights, and Water Rights, and the Right to be Self-Governing. This is a battle still in the Federal Courts (Salazar vs. Kawaiisu Tribe of Tejon). This "dual citizen" status creates tension within the U.S. colonial context even today, but was far more extreme before Indians were uniformly granted U.S. citizenship in 1924. As non-whites, and non-citizen indigenous people, the United States built discriminatory language into their own laws and took on special colonial projects that denied basic human rights—particularly in the areas of cultural expression and travel—to their indigenous non-citizen "wards".
Education.
After years of unequal schooling, for reasons from racist schools to insufficiently funded schools, the National Indian Education Association (NIEA) was formed to fight for equal education for American Indians in 1969. Another right American Indian Activists strove for was media protection: advocates went all the way to the United Nations to seek laws that protected the rights of Native people to own their own media, and for the prosecution of those who persecuted their journalists. Religious rights and molestation had a part of American Indian oppression as well. Until 1935, American Indian people could be fined and sent to prison for practising their traditional religious beliefs. In more recent times, there has been controversy around the use of American Indian symbols such as for school or team mascots. Concerns are that the use of the symbols distort American Indian history and culture and often stereotype in offensive ways, such as when “savages” is used...
Indian Civil Rights Act (1968).
With the passage of the Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA) in 1968, also called the Indian Bill of Rights, Native Americans were guaranteed many civil rights they had been fighting for. : The ICRA supports the following:
Other civil rights such as sovereignty, hunting and fishing, voting, and traveling have been fought for or are being sought.
Religious rights.
Religion before Euro-American contact.
Indigenous religions in the Americas are diverse and complex. Religious practices range from individual prayers, rituals, and offerings to large intertribal ceremonies. Usually religious expressions were defined by one's tribe; however, religious practices do arise that span multiple tribes. Others include the idea of an earth diver, who draws land from the depths of a primordial ocean.
Each tribal group has its own oral histories, which can include creation stories. Some are emergence stories, discussing entering this current world from below the earth's surface.
Precontact religion was often closely tied to the land. “The land, the environment, and a strong sense of place all had great religious significance. Essentially everything was tied to the supernatural, which led to a proliferation of religious practices across the continent." These concerns include the omnipresent, invisible universal force, taboos, pertaining to "the three 'life crises' of birth, puberty, and death," spiritual beings, revelations, human intercessors into the spirit world, and ceremonies that renew communities.
Religion after Euro-American contact.
Over the last five centuries, "Christianity has made enormous inroads into Native society." This is due to both voluntary and forced conversion; however, not all tribes embraced Christianity, nor did all members of tribes.
"Euro-American contact and interactions contributed much to Indian marginality and the disruption and destruction of traditional customs and even the aboriginal use of psychoactive substances. This process was noted in the 1976 Final Report to the American Indian Policy Review Commission, Task Force Eleven: Alcohol and Drug Abuse.
The American Indian Religious Freedom Act was passed in 1978. It allowed them freedom of religion except for the use of such important ceremonial items, as the eagle feathers or bones (a protected species) or peyote (considered a restricted drug by the federal government); however, other laws provide for ceremonial use of these by Native American religious practitioners.
One example of Christianity's influence on Native American religion is the prominence of the figure of Jesus Christ in peyote ceremonies of the Native American Church, which is a syncretic religion.
Many religious Native Americans today voluntarily practice Christianity, both Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, or a combination of Christianity and Native religion.
Many indigenous religions arose in response to colonization. These include the Longhouse Religion, which arose at the end of the 18th century, and the Ghost Dance, Four Mothers Society, Indian Shaker Church, Kuksu religion, and others in the 19th century.
Suppression by European Colonists.
The Native American religion was initially suppressed by the colonists who came from Europe with their own particular goals. These included "God, gold, and glory” and this conflicted with the American Indians way of life. From the time of Columbus’s “discovery” of America, Native American religion has routinely been suppressed by English, Spanish, and other European colonists.
The Christian Europeans who made the journey to the Americas believed it to be their duty to Christianize the Indian people. They felt it was their calling by God. Spaniards practiced Christianization in the New World using Pope Alexander VI’s papal bull, "Inter caetera". allowed rulers to “bring under their sway [non-Christian] ‘countries and islands’ discovered by Columbus, along with ‘their residents and inhabitants, and to bring them to the Catholic faith.’”
The missionaries developed "praying towns" to create "orderly Christian communities filled with model converts who were living and working under the watchful eye of a priest or pastor". Within these communities converts to the Christian faith would be placed in a separate area from the remainder of the tribe in order to prevent regression back to their Indian beliefs. Missionaries such as John Eliot a puritan and Isaac McCoy a Baptist lead the way in the spread of their beliefs within these types of towns and amongst the Indians. These towns lead the way to the future separation of the Indians from the remainder of society in Indian reservations.
Suppression during the Progressive Era.
During the Progressive Era from the 1890s to the 1920s, a "quasi-theocracy" reigned in what federal policymakers called "Indian Country"; they worked hand-in-hand with churches to impose Christianity upon Native Americans "as part of the government’s civilizing project”. Keeping in the vein of the colonialists before them, Progressive-Era policymakers found no need to separate religious endeavors concerning Native Americans from Indian political policy. The government provided various religious groups with funds to accomplish Native American conversion. It was during this time that the government “discouraged or imposed bans on many forms of traditional religious practices, including the Sun Dance, use of peyote in ceremonial settings and observance of potlatch rituals.” The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), or the "Indian Office", as it was then called, played a role in the Christianization of Native Americans. Their boarding schools, often staffed by missionaries, removed Indian children from the tribe and away from the influence of their cultures.
In order to pacify Christians, “some tribal religious practitioners modified elements of their traditional practices”. In the case of the Sun Dance, “a ceremony of renewal and spiritual reaffirmation”, some tribes “omit the element of self-sacrifice (many participants observed the ritual of skin piercing), reduced the number of days for the ceremony from eight to two and otherwise emphasized the ceremony’s social, rather than religious, features”. In the past, tribes have also moved religious days to coincide with national U.S. holidays.
Contemporary American Indian religious issues.
Established in 1918, the Native American Church “emphasiz the importance of monogamy, sobriety, and hard work”. Today, it serves as an intertribal, multilingual network. The Native American Church has had a long struggle with the government of America due to their ancient and deeply spiritual religious practice using peyote. Peyote is a psychoactive substance that is found on a cactus and it is used for healing practices and in religious ceremony. The use of this subject is highly debated due to the outbreaks of drug use especially the psychoactive ones among Americans today. Leaders of the American Indian Church argue that the use of peyote allows for a direct connection with gods and that peyote is not taken simply for its psychoactive effects. It is taken in the manner that one might take the sacraments of Christianity. "Peyote is not habit forming and ‘in the controlled ambiance of a peyote meeting it is in no way harmful’” Rather it is considered a unifying influence on the American Indian life because it provides the “basis for Indian friendships, rituals, social gatherings, travel, marriage, and more. It has been a source of healing and means of expression for a troubled people. And it has resulted in one of the strongest pan-Indian movements among American Indians”.
For years the government has been debating the subject of peyote use. In 1949 peyote use was condemned by the American Medical Association because findings in their study led them to believe that it was habit-forming drug. Congress then attempted to regulate the use of peyote in 1963 with little success, but under the Drug Abuse Control Act in 1965 it was on the list of forbidden psychedelic drugs. Under this act it did not place this on Native American peyotists who were using it for religious practice, though some suffered still under the hands of the state governments for having it in their possession. State laws differed from the United States government standards with states outlawing the use of peyote. “By 1970, of the seventeen states that still had anti-peyote laws, only five did not provide exemptions for Indians to use peyote ritually.” These were amended under the pressure from the Native American Church member if the members showed proof that they were at least 25 percent Native American. The states laws were generally similar to those of South Dakota, which says that "when used as a sacrament in services of the Native American Church in a natural state which is unaltered except for drying or curing or slicing", peyote use is permitted. In 1978 the American Indian Religious Freedom Act there was mention of protection for peyote users, but this did not change the fact that they could still be charged. Because it is an “established religion of many centuries’ history...not a 20th century cult nor a fad subject to extinction at a whim”, it continues to be somewhat protected under the law. Problems have arisen when those who are not of Native American descent join the Native American Church solely for the use of peyote.
Sovereignty.
All American Indian tribes are under the U.S. government just as other minority groups. However, unlike other minority groups who are immigrants to the United States, American Indians are indigenous to American land and have therefore sought and gained sovereignty. Native sovereignty is made complex by the fact that the British (in colonial times) and American government also co-exist in the same country. Furthermore, American Indian “government” is not government in the traditional sense of authority and control, but is more like leadership over a community. It is difficult to describe American Indian government in a definite manner due to the fact that there are many different Native tribes with different forms of governing. As of August 2012, there are federally recognized 564 American Indian tribes. During the colonial period, American Indian sovereignty was upheld by the negotiation of treaties between British proprietor and American Indian tribes. Treaties are agreements between two sovereign governments, and, therefore, the treaties made were made under the understanding that the tribes had equal sovereignty to the sovereignty of the colonial governments.
Fishing and hunting rights.
Although Native Americans consented to or were forced to give up their land, the government allotted them hunting and fishing rights both within their reservations and on their old land that had been sold to and settled by whites. The reserved rights doctrine allowed for tribes to hunt and fish, along with any other rights, as long as they were not specifically denied in a treaty. This angered white hunters and fishers who had restrictions placed on them by the government and they protested against the Indians' right to fish and hunt off of reservations. State agencies pointed out that conservation efforts were possibly compromised by the Native Americans' habits; however the Supreme Court upheld the privilege with certain cases, such as "United States v. Winans" (1905) and "Antoine v. Washington" (1975), even going so far as to appropriate from Native Americans the right to hunt and fish on all of their old grounds whether or not they were currently privately owned. The largest amount of opposition and resentment towards Native Americans' fishing and hunting rights stems from the Pacific Northwest.
Traveling rights.
During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the U.S. government attempted to control the travel of Native Americans off Indian reservations. Since Native Americans did not obtain U.S. citizenship until 1924, they were considered wards of the state and were denied various basic rights, including the right to travel. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) discouraged off-reservation activities, including the right to hunt, fish, or visit other tribes. As a result, the BIA instituted a “pass system” designed to control movement of the Indians. This system required Indians living on reservations to obtain a pass from an Indian agent before they could leave the reservation.
In addition, agents were often ordered to limit the number of passes they issued for off-reservation travel. The reasons cited for this limitation were that Indians with passes often overstayed the time limits imposed, and many times Indians left without requesting passes. When this occurred, the military was frequently called to help return the Indians to their reservations. For example, in April 1863, Superintendent J. W. Perit Huntington recovered 500 Native Americans from the Willamette Valley who had violated the pass system, and estimated that up to 300 escaped Indians were still in the area.
While attempting to implement this pass system, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) received numerous complaints regarding Indians who traveled without permission. Many complained that Native Americans were killing game merely for the sport and were taking the hides. Other settlers complained that Indians overstayed their visits at neighboring reservations while neglecting their farming duties at home. For example, in December, 1893, Governor John E. Osborne of Wyoming wrote a letter to the BIA protesting that Indians from Fort Hall, Lemhi, Wind River, and Crow Reservations were leaving illegally. In response, the commissioner sent a note to all Indian agents stating that Indians who disobeyed the pass system would be arrested and punished by state officials. Additional rules were also implemented at this time. For example, the Indian agents were now required to notify other reservations of the departure time of Indians, names of Indians, and the route they intended to follow.
In addition to these concerns, many white settlers were unhappy with the travel of Native Americans on the railroads. For example, the Central Pacific Railroad in Nevada had granted Indians the privilege of riding on the roof and flatbeds of rail cars without tickets, in exchange for the right-of-way through their reservations. Other railroad lines, including the Carson and the Colorado allowed free railroad travel to the Indians. Paiute Indians, for example, frequently rode the trains to their traditional hunting and fishing grounds. "Paiutes would pack up their gathering baskets and hop on the rails, take off a day or two to gather seeds, and bring their harvest back home again, on the car roofs. Men and women used free passes to travel into town or to ranches farther in the hinterlands for jobs." Angry Indian agents, who wanted the Paiutes to stay under their jurisdiction, wrote letters urging the BIA to stop this free travel. According to one Indian agent, "The injurious effects of this freedom from restraint, and continual change of place, on the Indian, can not be overestimated."
The loss of the right to free movement across the country was difficult for Native Americans, especially since many tribes traditionally traveled to hunt, fish, and visit other tribes. The passage of the Indian Citizenship Act in 1924 granted citizenship to all Indians born in America. As a result, American Indians were finally granted free travel in the United States. At the present time, Native Americans who live on reservations are free to travel as they wish.
Voting.
In the 18th century, starting when the Constitution was created, there was a struggle to define what the Indian tribes’ relationship was with the United States. Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution states that Indians are not under the control of the United States, and therefore cannot be taxed. The Constitution also stated that Congress has the power to “regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among several states, and with Indian tribes” as stated in Article I, Section 8. This means that the leaders of the United States at that time viewed Indians as somewhere in between foreign nations and American citizens.
The Marshall trilogy in 1831 helped define sovereignty by stating that the Cherokee nation was a distinct political society but a domestic dependent nation and one that "resembles that of a ward to a guardian". Therefore Native Americans' relationship to the U.S. government was similar to that of people in an occupied land under the control of a foreign power. This definition meant that Indian people did not have a right to vote. Further clarification was made when in 1856 Attorney General Caleb Cushing stated, “Indians are the subjects of the United States, and therefore are not, in mere right of home-birth, citizens of the United States.
In 1817 the Cherokee became the first Native Americans recognized as U.S. citizens. Under Article 8 of the 1817 Cherokee treaty, "Upwards of 300 Cherokees (Heads of Families) in the honest simplicity of their souls, made and election to become American citizens." When the Fourteenth Amendment and the first civil rights act were passed in 1866 regarding the role of African-Americans in the United States, citizenship of Indians was defined as well. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 states, “That all persons born in the United States, and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States". The country at this time was not necessarily ready for Indians to become citizens. Senator Jacob Howard of Michigan commented, “I am not yet prepared to pass a sweeping act of naturalization by which all the Indian savages, wild or tame, belonging to a tribal relation, are to become my fellow-citizens and go to the polls and vote with me… (Congressional Globe 1866, 2895)". This sentiment is also shown through a Senate floor debate regarding the Fourteenth Amendment where James Rood Doolittle of Wisconsin stated, “…all those wild Indians to be citizens of the United States, the Great Republic of the world, whose citizenship should be a title as proud as that of king, and whose danger is that you may degrade that citizenship (Congressional Globe 1866, 2892).” (McCool 3) One of his other concerns was that because of the substantial number of Indians at the time, their numbers would be able to overwhelm the power of the white vote. As Doolittle argued, “there is a large mass of the Indian population who are clearly subject to the jurisdiction of the United States who ought not to be included as citizens of the United States…the word “citizen,” if applied to them, would bring in all the Digger Indians of California”.
While not all Indians were granted citizenship at that time under a blanket law, there were some special considerations made to grant individual Indians citizenship. This in turn gave them the right of suffrage. For example, a treaty involving the United States and the Lakota people demonstrates this. In 1868 Article 6 of the Treaty of Fort Laramie stated that Indians could gain citizenship by "receiving a patent for land under the foregoing provisions… and be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of such citizens, and shall, at the same time retain all rights to benefits accruing to Indians under this treaty”. The advantage of this was that the Indians could become citizens yet still maintain their status and rights as Indians.
Even for signatory Indian Nations to the Fort Laramie Treaty, however, it was made clear though that just because a few Indians were citizens, it did not mean that they all in turn had the right to vote. In 1884, when John Elk, an Indian who lived in Omaha, Nebraska, attempted to register in local elections, he was refused a ballot. When he took the case to Supreme Court and through the "Elk v. Wilkins" trial, he was ruled against under the circumstances that Indians did not fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.
The Dawes Act in 1887 continued to pave the pathway for Indian citizenship in that members of certain Native American tribes who accepted an allotment of land was considered a citizen. The goal was for Indians to, through assimilation, "adopt the habits of civilized life". This movement certainly convinced a lot of Indians to gain citizenship. This is seen through President Theodore Roosevelt’s statement on the allotment policy in which he reported that by 1901, 60,000 Indians had already become citizens of the United States.
Piece by piece, more acts were created that added Indians to the citizenship rolls. When the Indian Territory (what is now Oklahoma) was abolished in 1907, all Indians who lived in that territory were made citizens through the Oklahoma Enabling Act.
Furthermore, after World War I, any Indian who had fought with honorable discharge was also considered a citizen through the Act of November 6, 1919. As Native Vote states, “The underlying assumption of this act was that these particular Indians had demonstrated that they had become part of the larger Anglo culture and were no longer wholly Indian”.
By the early 1920s, Congress was considering a bill to make the remainder of Native Americans citizens in their aim to have them “adopt Anglo culture”. This finally was stated with the Indian Citizenship Act which was created on June 24, 1924. This act showed progress in that Indians would not have to give up being an Indian to be a citizen of the United States. This included being an enrolled member of a tribe, living on a federally recognized reservation, or practicing his or her culture. However, this did not create the right to vote automatically.
There remained instances in many states that still prevented Indians from voting, even though they were citizens of the United States. For example, the attorney general of Colorado in 1936 declared that Indians could not vote because they were not citizens of the state. Similarly, states found ways around voting in other ways. Because the Fifteenth Amendment 1870 barred states from limiting voting on account of race, states found other ways – residency: claiming that Native Americans were not residents of the state if they resided on reservations, self-termination: one must first abandon their tribal ties in order to vote, taxation: Indians who do not need to pay taxes cannot vote, guardianship: the claim that Native Americans were incompetent and “wards of the state”, and on the lack of ability to read English (McCool 19)
With World War II and the need for more soldiers through the draft, Congress reaffirmed Native people’s citizenship with the Nationality Act of 1940. However, when some 25,000 veterans returned home after the war, they realized that even though they had put their lives on the line for their country, they were still not allowed to vote.
In 1965 the Voting Rights Act (VRA) put an end to individual states claims on whether or not Indians were allowed to vote through a federal law. Section 2 of the VRA states that, “No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure, shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color". Further sections describe the measures taken if violations to this act are discovered.
However, efforts by states and municipalities to disenfranchise American Indians are ongoing, such that there have been about 74 cases brought by or on behalf of Indians under the VRA or the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment since 1965. These in the most part have proved to be successful to upholding the rights of Native Americans as citizens of the United States. Most of these cases are centered on states that have large reservations, or Indian populations, such as New Mexico, Arizona and Oklahoma.
Land rights.
One of the major issues surrounding land ownership rights of the Native American Nations is for what they are and are not allowed to use their land.
A typical example of the struggle faced involved the Seneca Nation of New York State. On April 18, 2007, the Seneca Nation laid claim to a stretch of Interstate 90 that crosses the Cattaraugus Reservation by revoking the 1954 agreement that granted the Interstate Highway System and New York State Thruway Authority permission to build the highway through the territory. The move was a direct shot at New York Governor Eliot Spitzer's attempts to collect taxes on Seneca territory. The Senecas had previously made the same claim in a lawsuit which they lost because of the state's assertion of sovereign immunity. In Magistrate Heckman's Report and Recommendation it was noted that the State of New York asserted its immunity from suit against both counts of the complaint (one count was the challenge regarding the state's acquisition of Grand Island and other smaller islands in the Niagara River and another count challenging the thruway easement). The United States was permitted to intervene on behalf of the Seneca Nation and the Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians. The United States was then directed to file an amended complaint that "clearly states the relief sought by the United States in this action". In this amended complaint the United States did not seek any relief on behalf of the Seneca Nation relative to the thruway easement. By not seeking such relief in its amended complaint the United States of America permitted the action relative to the thruway easement to be subject to dismissal based on New York's immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. On May 4, the Seneca Nation threatened to do the same with Interstate 86.

Fernando I, Duke of Braganza

Dom Fernando I of Braganza (; 1403 – 1 April 1478) was the 2nd Duke of Braganza and the 1st Marquis of Vila Viçosa, among other titles. He took part in the Portuguese conquests in North Africa and served as governor of different territories there.
Early Life and North African Conquest.
Born in 1403, when Fernando was a child, he inherited the title of 3rd Count of Arraiolos.
In 1432, the young Fernando was called upon by King John I for consultation on a project, promoted by Prince Henry the Navigator, to launch a campaign of conquest against the Marinid sultante of Morocco. Fernando submitted opinion was almost wholly against the project. When the project was picked up again during the reign of King Edward in 1436, Fernando once again reiterated his objections. Nonetheless, despite his opposition, Edward appointed Fernando as constable of the nobles for the 1437 expedition to seize Tangier. Although the expedition was under the overall command of Henry the Navigator, Edward felt Fernando's military expertise was necessary to make up for Henry's inexperience.
After failing to conquer the city by assault, the Portuguese expeditionary army was surrounded and starved into submission by a Moroccan relief army. In return for being allowed to withdraw his troops unmolested, Henry agreed to a treaty to deliver Ceuta back to the Marinids. For the fulfillment of the treaty, Henry handed over his own brother, Ferdinand the Saint Prince as a hostage to the Moroccans.
Return to Portugal.
Back in Portugal, Fernando led the opposition to the treaty. At the Cortes of Leiria assembled in early 1438 by King Edward, Fernando rallied the nobles and took the floor, urging them to refuse to surrender Ceuta. Fernando claimed the treaty was signed under duress and invalid. It was largely because of Fernando's energetic campaign that the Cortes rejected ratification and told the king to find some other way of securing Prince Fernando's release (none was found - Fernando the Saint Prince would die in Moroccan captivity in 1443).
Fernando was nominated Governor of Ceuta from 1445 until 1450.
By royal decree dated from May 25, 1455, King Afonso V of Portugal granted Fernando the new title of 1st Marquis of Vila Viçosa.
In 1458, Fernando took part, along with his sons, in the expedition that conquered the Moroccan city of Alcácer Ceguer.
In 1460, as his older brother Afonso, died without legitimate issue, he became the 5th Count of Ourém and the House of Braganza's heir. One year later, following his father’s death, in 1461, he also became the 2nd Duke of Braganza, 9th Count of Barcelos, 3rd Count of Neiva, and 3rd Count of Faria.
In 1471, when King Afonso V took to North Africa to conquer the city of Arzila, he remained in mainland Portugal as regent of the kingdom.
Marriage and Issue.
Fernando I married, on 28 December 1429, D. Joana de Castro, Lady of Cadaval, (1410 - 14 February 1479). They had nine children, of whom three were still born.

Dines Green

Dines Green is a suburb of Worcester in England, and lies in the St. John ward in the west of the city . Initially developed as council housing, the estate now consists of a mix of council and privately owned homes: 49% of households were renting from the council or another landlord as of the 2001 Census.
History.
Formerly farming land, Dines Green was built in the late 1950s by the building contractor Spicers and consisted of a mix of semi-detached homes and large blocks of flats. Worcester City Council at the time wanted uniformity in the front gardens of houses on the estate, turfing over any deviations from this uniformity. The vast majority of the semi detached homes were built using precast concrete; these homes were updated in the 1980s with the concrete being stripped away and replaced with brick. The blocks of flats that were built using pre cast concrete were demolished (also in the 1980s) and new “apartments” built in their place.
The original residents of Dines Green were working class families at the lower end of the social scale. Employment amongst the residents was high though and centered upon mostly unskilled positions and qualified tradesman. The 2001 census found little change: 42% of adults had no qualifications, but unemployment was close to the city average.
When Dines Green was built a small play area for children was provided, but it was lost together with other small grassed areas during the 1980s restoration of the estate.
2007 Worcestershire Flooding.
During the widespread flooding throughout 2007 in Worcestershire, the Dines Green area was hit by water running off the nearby fields and flooding peoples homes. As a result of the flooding, many of the telephone cables in the area were affected, resulting in residents receiving the wrong calls. Flooding was also reported in the area in June 1955.
Amenities.
There are a number of shops in Dines Green including a post office. The local church, St. Michaels Anglican Church was constructed with much of the estate surrounding it in the early 1960s. Manor Park Evangelical Church meet at Dines Green Primary School.
Education.
Dines Green Primary School is located on the estate, catering for 169 pupils. Every year the school holds a traditional May Day parade. Following ofsted reports, the school was placed in special measures in 1997 and 2002, however the school was later reassessed in 2006 as being good.
Transport.
First have traditionally operated the majority of bus services in Worcester, including the Dines Green estate. Red Diamond are due to start operations in competition with First from 1 September 2009, including a new night bus service on the estate. First used to operate a night service to Dines Green in 2002.
Expansion.
As part of the South Worcestershire Joint Core Strategy plan, Dines Green has been earmarked to receive 3,500 extra homes. The construction will include primary and secondary schools, alongside extra shops and leisure facilities. A £100 million northern link road was planned to link the area to Barbourne, however in 2008 this plan was cancelled due to fears of increased commuting.
Sport.
Nathan Baker is a professional footballer who was born in Dines Green. He is currently playing at Premier League side Aston Villa, but has also played on loan at Lincoln City in Coca-Cola League Two.

Škoda 15 T

Škoda 15T (also known as Škoda ForCity) is a 100% low-floor multiple-unit tram developed by Škoda (Plzeň) for the Prague tram network. It was a development of the Škoda 14 T, adding articulated bogies and more power to correct for problems found during the introduction of the 14 T. The 15 T featured articulated bogies at either end of the train, and Jacobs bogies between the segments. The tram has two double-doors in each segment (or four in bi-directional version) to allow fast boarding of passengers, and one extra side door leading to the driver's cabin.
Design.
The Škoda 15 T ForCity was developed as highly modular; it is offered with up to five car body sections and in length. It may be used on gauges from up to and the body may be wide. The tram can be uni-directional or bi-directional. It can have from 60% of wheels driven up to all of the wheels driven for networks in hilly cities. As the bogies are under articulations and don't interfere with the inner space of the body sections, there is unlimited choice of interior lay-out and location of doors.
The basic vehicle length can be modified. It is also possible to couple two or more vehicles. The tram's appearance, colours and front design are user-defined.
Bogies.
The fixed bogies which are used by most 100% low floor trams increase track wear and decrease the speed at which a tram can drive through a curve (usually in radius curve). The 15 T is designed to cope with these issues through Jacobs bogies under the articulations and pivoting bogies at the tram's ends. Currently it is the only true 100% low floor tram with pivoting bogies in production, although the Alstom Citadis X04, an experimental 100% low floor tram currently being developed with pivoting bogies (but with sections of high floor seating over the bogies), has made an initial production appearance as a modified Citadis 301 (with a fixed centre bogie) in Istanbul. With the same length of tramcar, the Škoda 15 T has also four bogies compared to the predecessor Škoda 14 T's three (same on most other 100% low floor trams) (fixed) bogies, which decreases the load each wheel puts on the track. The most of the tram floor is at height of above rail; the height over the bogies is above rail; the transition is inclined, without interior steps. The corridor above the central bogies is wide. The bogies may be all driven, or some of them may be normal ones, depending on the customer's preferences. The bogies have two axles and two-level springing. The mounted wheels are made of rubber-sprung wheels with integrated brake-discs and axle bearing. On the axle bearings there is a combined, dynamically resistant, primary rubber-bonded-metal-sprung bogie framework. This bogie framework supports four traction motors and one (in outer bogies) or two (in inner bogies) sprung swing bolsters. The secondary springing of the swing bolsters is secured by steel coil springs with parallel hydraulic rotating dampers. On the swing bolsters there are pivot bearings, which facilitate full rotation of the bogie below the body without any limitations.
Wheels and engines.
All bogies are equipped with identical wheels, which have tyres damping rubber pads to minimize noise. Selected bogies could be equipped with a sanding system.
The vehicle is driven by traction units. Each unit consists of traction container on the vehicle roof and of four traction motors, which drive wheels of one driving bogie. Individual wheel drive on respective bogies secures perfect use of adhesive conditions and ideal ride both in bends and on straight lines. There are three-phase synchronous motors with permanent magnet excitation on rotor. They are fixed to the bogie framework from the wheels outside. The traction motors don't use a gear box - they drive tram wheels directly through a mechanically disconnectable jaw clutch.
While the drive is controlled by two control units connected together by fast serial communication, the safety circuits and functions are hardware-resolved.
Brakes.
Braking is mainly done by electrodynamic brake enabling recuperation of the braking energy back to the electrical grid. If there is no need of it, the braking energy is being used primarily for feeding the vehicle's auxiliary equipment with the rest depleted in the brake resistors. The electrodynamic brake is able to automatically run even during grid's voltage failure. In case of failure, braking is automatically done by the system of friction disc brake, which will work until the vehicle comes to a complete halt. The friction disc brake is hydraulically controlled with an electric compression unit. Each bogies is also equipped with a pair of electromagnetic rail brakes with voltage of 24 V DC. The friction disc brake also ensures the parking brake function.
Doors.
The vehicle has two double doors on each body unit (or four of them on bi-directional version), or alternatively there can be one door each side on each body unit located in place of any of the side panels. The driver has a separate door leading to the driver's cabin. The doors slide outwards. Each door is equipped with an individual control unit, which operates it and communicates with the vehicle central control unit. In selected double-doors area there could be either ramp or lift enabling easy entry for passengers with restricted mobility. There could be also a room for bicycles and prams.
Production.
Prague.
Škoda ForCity won the bidding process of the Prague transport company for 250 new trams in 2005. The order is worth 17 billion CZK (about 68 million CZK per unit (2,3 million € per unit - 1€ 2005=29,6CZK)).
The trials of the first prototype started in 2009, the first rides with passengers started in October 2010 and the last tramcar will be delivered in 2017. The prototype had 3 types of seats - wooden, plastic and with fabric upholstery. Passengers have decided in an internet poll that the wooden seats will be used in the delivered version.
During the delivery of the first batch in 2011, the Prague transport company started negotiations with Škoda regarding instalment of air conditioning for the passenger compartment. It also raised concern, that 1000 horse power streetcar may be unnecessarily powerful and proposed solution used at Riga version, which has only three out of four bogies driven. In view of the transport company the price of additional air conditioning should be covered by elimination of the first boogie's engines. As of May 2011, it is not yet decided, whether this solution will be applied. Firstly there is issue that participants of the original tender may contest the change and require a new competition for the delivery of Prague's trams, secondly it has to be tested, whether 15 T without full adhesion would be able to drive on Prague's hilly network.
Riga.
In May 2008 Škoda made a contract with the Riga transport company (Latvia) for delivery of 20 trams (with option for another 32) worth 1,3 billion CZK (about 65 million CZK per unit (2,6 million € per unit - 1€ 2008 = 25CZK)). The bidding process started in 2007 and altogether 9 companies took part in it. The Riga variant is three-segmented, like the Prague version, with air-conditioning for whole tram (Prague only for driver's cabin) and it is in white-blue livery. Unlike Prague's version, which has all bogies driven due to difficult adhesive conditions (Prague has hilly terrain), the Riga tram has 3 bogies driven (the 1st bogie doesn't have motors). The tram has upholstered seats similar to those in Škoda trolleybuses used in Riga.
The first tram was delivered to Riga in March 2010, the second in August 2010 and the other 18 will be delivered before the end of 2010. The first rides with passengers were in June 2010 after preceding test-drives.
There will also be 6 four-segmented tramcars (41 meters long) made for Riga, Latvia, as the town decided to apply a part of the preagreed option of 32 (which was part of the previous order for 20).
Other tenders.
At the end of September 2010 Škoda entered bidding process for 12 new trams of German city of Rostock with the ForCity tram. Škoda did not win this tender.
The 15T was also submitted in a proposal for Helsinki, Finland, but did not win the tender. Currently, Škoda has entered a tender for Zürich, Switzerland.
In April 2011 Škoda announced it will start a lawsuit against transport authority of Essen, Germany, which announced a selection procedure for delivery of 27 new trams. Škoda believes the procedure's technical requirements to be so specific that they effectively reduced competition (contrary to European law), leaving Škoda not able to offer its bid.
Testing in Chemnitz.
Škoda 15T underwent testing in German city Chemnitz (previously known also as Karl-Marx-Stadt) in April–May 2012.

Curtis Axel

Joseph Curtis "Joe" Hennig (born October 1, 1979) is an American professional wrestler currently signed to WWE, where he wrestles under the ring name Curtis Axel.
He debuted in WWE in 2010, joining The Nexus under the ring name Michael McGillicutty. He had previously wrestled at their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) and was part of the second season of "WWE NXT". In 2011, Hennig won the WWE Tag Team Championship with David Otunga as a member of The New Nexus. In May 2013, Hennig reignited his career under his current ring name Curtis Axel, paying tribute to his father "Mr. Perfect" Curt Hennig and his grandfather Larry "The Axe" Hennig.
Professional wrestling career.
World League Wrestling (2007–2008).
Hennig made his professional debut on July 13, 2007 in Waterloo, Iowa for World League Wrestling (WLW), teaming with Ted DiBiase, Jr. to defeat Dinn T. Moore and Branden Tatum by disqualification. Hennig later went on a nine-month winning streak in WLW before suffering his first singles loss to "Wild" Wade Chism.
World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE (2007-present).
Florida Championship Wrestling (2007–2010).
On March 31, 2007, Hennig along with his mother, siblings, and his grandfather represented his father "Mr. Perfect" Curt Hennig at the 2007 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony by accepting the award on his behalf. On the October 26, 2007 episode of "SmackDown", Hennig teamed with Steve Fender in a loss to Jesse and Festus.
Hennig signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment and was assigned to its developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). On September 11, 2008, Hennig and Sebastian Slater defeated Nic Nemeth and Gavin Spears to win the Florida Tag Team Championship. On October 30, Hennig and Slater lost the Tag Team Championship to The New Hart Foundation (DH Smith and TJ Wilson).
On November 20, Hennig challenged Sheamus O'Shaunessy for the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship, but the match ended in a double disqualification. A rematch was made, but Hennig was again disqualified. Hennig had another chance to win the title on December 11 when he participated in a fatal four-way match for the championship, but Eric Escobar won the match and the title in the process. Hennig defeated Escobar on February 26 at a television taping and won the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship. On the April 5, 2009 episode of FCW it was announced that Hennig had suffered a serious injury and therefore he had surrendered the Florida Heavyweight Championship.
After recovering, Hennig made his return to FCW in late June. Soon afterwards, he formed a tag team with Brett DiBiase known as The Fortunate Sons. On January 14, 2010, The Sons won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship by defeating The Dudebusters. On March 13, The Fortunate Sons lost the championship to The Uso Brothers (Jimmy and Jules). At the April 8 FCW television tapings, Hennig blamed DiBiase for the loss, and in a match at the tapings, the two fought to a double disqualification. At an FCW event on April 29, DiBiase faced Hennig again, but suffered a knee injury during the match, ending their feud. On July 15 Hennig, now using the name Michael McGillicutty, teamed with Kaval to win the tag team titles for the fourth time from "Los Aviadores" (Hunico and Epico). The following day, on July 16, "Los Aviadores" regained the championship.
NXT and The Nexus (2010–2011).
Hennig took part in the second season of "NXT", using the ring name Michael McGillicutty, with Kofi Kingston as his pro. He made his "NXT" debut on the June 8 episode, but did not compete in a match. He made his in-ring debut on the following edition of "NXT", teaming with Kingston in a tag team match, where they defeated Mark Henry and Lucky Cannon. In the first poll on June 29, McGillicutty was ranked third, behind Kaval and Percy Watson. On the July 20 episode of "NXT", McGillicutty earned immunity from elimination in the next poll by completing an obstacle course in the fastest time. On the following episode of "NXT", he moved up to first place in the second poll. After six consecutive victories, McGillicutty suffered his first loss on the August 3 episode of "NXT", when he was defeated by pro The Miz. On August 9 the rookies appeared in a six-man tag team match on "Raw", in which McGillicutty teamed with Husky Harris and Alex Riley to defeat Lucky Cannon, Kaval and Percy Watson. The following night on "NXT", his team lost a rematch when McGillicutty was pinned by Kaval. In the next poll later that night, McGillicutty relinquished the first place ranking back to Kaval, slipping to second place. In the season finale on August 31, McGillicutty ended the competition in second place, being beaten by Kaval. At the end of the show, McGillicutty turned heel by attacking Kaval with the other eliminated rookies.
In October 2010, at Hell in a Cell, McGillicutty and Husky Harris disguised themselves as fans and interfered during the match between John Cena and Wade Barrett. This allowed Barrett to pin Cena and win the match, forcing Cena to join The Nexus per the pre-match stipulation. McGillicutty's and Harris' identities were revealed on the following day's episode of "Raw", though Barrett claimed he had not asked for their help and refused to make them full time members of The Nexus. The following week, McGillicutty and Harris interfered in a match between Cena and The Miz, costing Cena the match and prompting Barrett to give them the opportunity to win membership in The Nexus. On the October 18 episode of "Raw", McGillicutty and Harris were unable to earn a place in The Nexus when they lost to Cena and Randy Orton in a tag team match. Despite this, Barrett confirmed both he and Harris were members on the October 25 episode of "Raw".
In January 2011 CM Punk took over The Nexus and had each of its members put through an initiation. McGillicutty passed his initiation, a beatdown from the rest of the group, and was allowed to remain a member of Nexus, alongside Punk, Harris and Otunga. The following month, Punk was announced as the WrestleMania XXVII opponent for Randy Orton, and as a result, each member of The Nexus was scheduled to face Orton in the month prior to WrestleMania. McGillicutty faced and lost to Orton on the February 28 episode of "Raw", and after the match Orton punted McGillicutty in the head. The angle was used to write McGillicutty off television as he was scheduled to be sent back to Florida Championship Wrestling to be repackaged. Despite this, McGillicutty returned on the April 11 episode of "Raw" with the other New Nexus members, preventing Orton from earning a WWE Championship match.
On the May 23 episode of "Raw", McGillicutty teamed with fellow Nexus member David Otunga to win the WWE Tag Team Championship from Kane and The Big Show with the help interference from fellow New Nexus members Ryan and Punk. They made their only successful title defense against The Usos on the July 29 edition of "SmackDown". After CM Punk left the New Nexus when his WWE contract expired on July 17, Otunga and McGillicutty competed against Santino Marella and Zack Ryder on the August 1 edition of "Raw" without any Nexus gear or armbands, and with all Nexus logos removed from their TitanTron, effectively signaling the end of the New Nexus. On the August 22 episode of "Raw", Otunga and McGillicutty lost the Tag Team Championship to Air Boom (Kofi Kingston and Evan Bourne). After a minor feud with Jerry Lawler, the duo parted ways.
Return to NXT (2011–2013).
After his dissociation with Otunga, McGillicutty from late 2011 to mid-2013 would largely be confined to wrestling on the "WWE Superstars" and "WWE NXT" shows. On the October 20 episode of "Superstars", McGillicutty and Drew McIntyre lost a non-title match to the WWE Tag Team Champions Air Boom (Kofi Kingston and Evan Bourne). In late 2011, McGillicutty and Alex Riley had a series of matches on "Superstars" which Riley won 2-1. On the February 23, 2012 episode of "Superstars", McGillicutty defeated Riley, which would be his last televised win on a non-NXT show until he was repackaged as Curtis Axel in May 2013, resulting in McGillicutty losing more than twenty non-NXT matches in a row, mostly on "Superstars" but also on "WWE Main Event and WWE Saturday Morning Slam.
Meanwhile, McGillicutty made his return to NXT, appearing from January 2012 on the fifth season "NXT Redemption", but not as a Rookie. In late February 2012, McGillicutty mocked Tyson Kidd's lack of wrestling heritage, starting a feud on "NXT Redemption". McGillicutty then beat Kidd on the February 29 episode of "NXT Redemption". McGillicutty continued to insult Kidd by claiming that Kidd would never be a true 'Hart', and Kidd received a rematch on the March 21 edition of "NXT Redemption", where he defeated McGillicutty. Kidd and McGillicutty faced off in a third match on the April 11 episode of "NXT", resulting in Kidd triumphant over McGillicutty. McGillicutty then formed an occasional team with Johnny Curtis for the rest of 2012. On the final episode of the fifth season of "NXT" on June 13, Curtis and McGillicutty lost to the Usos.
After the conclusion of "NXT Redemption", NXT transitioned into the renamed Florida Championship Wrestling developmental territory. McGillicutty continued appearing on the rebooted "WWE NXT", losing to rival Tyson Kidd on the first episode on June 20. McGillicutty then pinned Kidd in a six-man tag match on the July 4 episode. Two weeks later, McGillicutty's and his occasional partner Johnny Curtis defeated Bo Dallas and Derrick Bateman. On the August 8 episode of "NXT", McGillicutty was inserted into the Gold Rush Tournament to crown the first NXT Champion, where he defeated Justin Gabriel in the quarter-finals. However, McGillicutty was eliminated in the semi-finals on August 15 when he lost to eventual tournament winner Seth Rollins. On the next episode, Kidd heaped more misery on McGillicutty as he and Gabriel defeated Curtis and McGillicutty, but on the September 12 episode of "NXT", McGillicutty gained revenge by defeating Kidd to become the #1 contender to the NXT Championship. On the October 10 episode of "NXT", McGillicutty lost the title match to champion Seth Rollins. Then on the November 28 episode of "NXT", Curtis finally cashed in his promised tag title shot from winning season four of "NXT" with McGillicutty as his partner against Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan), but Team Hell No won the match.
In 2013, McGillicutty turned face (but only within NXT) after saving Bo Dallas from a beating at the hands of Primo and Epico. On the next episode, Primo and Epico defeated Dallas and McGillicutty, though Dallas and McGillicutty would gain revenge when they defeated Primo and Epico in the first round of the NXT Tag Team Championship Tournament to crown the inaugural champions on the January 30 episode of "NXT". On the February 6 episode of "NXT", Dallas and McGillicutty were eliminated in the semi-finals when they lost to the Wyatt Family (Luke Harper and Erick Rowan).
Intercontinental Champion and various alliances (2013–present).
On the May 20, 2013, episode of "Raw", Hennig was repackaged under the ring name Curtis Axel, with Paul Heyman as his new manager. The name is a derivative of his father's first name, Curt, and his grandfather Larry's nickname "The Axe". Later that night, Axel wrestled Triple H in his re-debut match, which ended with a victory for Axel via knockout after Triple H suffered concussion-like symptoms and collapsed outside the ring. On the May 24 edition of "SmackDown", Axel defeated Sin Cara. Over the next two weeks on "Raw", Axel scored back-to-back non-title count-out wins over WWE Champion John Cena due to distractions and an interference by Ryback. Axel defeated Chris Jericho with a roll-up after Jericho was distracted by CM Punk's music playing, but was attacked by him following the victory on the June 7 "SmackDown". Three days later on "Raw", Axel defeated Triple H twice in one night when during their first match of the night Vince McMahon appeared and ended the match with Triple H losing by disqualification. Moments after, however, Triple H demanded the match be restarted, but - like the first time - McMahon came back and ended the match with a Triple H forfeit, despite Triple H having no such intentions. On June 16 at Payback, Axel defeated Wade Barrett and The Miz in a triple threat match to win the Intercontinental Championship, his first singles title in WWE. Axel's win saw him join his father "Mr Perfect" as the only father-son pair to have won the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Axel made his first televised title defense on the following episode of "SmackDown", defeating Barrett in a rematch. On the June 24 "Raw", Axel saved Paul Heyman's former client CM Punk from an assault by the Prime Time Players, at the request of Heyman and to the dismay of Punk. This led to a tag team match the following week on "Raw", where Axel won the match the for his team after he tagged himself in following Punk delivering the "Go To Sleep" on Darren Young and pinned him for the victory. Axel suffered his first loss since becoming Heyman's client on the July 8 episode of "Raw", when he was pinned by Chris Jericho in a non-title match. Six days later at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, Axel defeated The Miz to retain the Intercontinental Championship. Axel made another title defense on the following episode of "SmackDown", defeating Chris Jericho.
Axel then feuded with CM Punk alongside Paul Heyman. Axel was set to team with Heyman in an elimination handicap match against Punk at Night of Champions. During the pay-per-view, Heyman begged Triple H to cancel the match, but Triple H refused, not only confirming the match, but making Axel defend his Intercontinental Championship against Kofi Kingston, who had beaten him twice. Axel would defeat Kingston and retain the title, but he would be eliminated by Punk later in the night, leaving Heyman alone to fight Punk by himself. Ryback would then later interfere in the match by slamming Punk through a table. On the September 30 episode of "Raw" he was defeated by R-Truth in a non-title match, which gave him a title match at Battleground. On October 6 at Battleground he would defeat R-Truth and successfully retained the Intercontinental Championship. The next night on "Raw" Axel teamed up with Ryback to face R-Truth and CM Punk. R-Truth picked up the victory for his team, pinning Axel. On the October 11 "SmackDown" Axel once again retained the Intercontinental Championship against R-Truth. At Hell in a Cell, Axel was scheduled to defend his title against Big E Langston, however the match was cancelled due to Curtis' legitimate hip injury. Axel lost the title to Langston on the November 18 "Raw". Axel failed again to regain the Intercontinental Championship in a rematch at Survivor Series against Big E Langston. Later however, he and Ryback won a non title match against Cody Rhodes & Goldust, putting them in line for a future WWE Tag Team Championship shot, but they lost their opportunity.
Personal life.
Hennig is a third generation professional wrestler; his grandfather Larry "The Axe" Hennig and his father Curt Hennig were both professional wrestlers. His sister Amy is also a professional wrestler. He has two other siblings who are not wrestlers. Hennig and his wife had a son, Brock, in June 2009. He enjoys ice fishing and fantasy football.

Chiprovtsi Monastery

Chiprovtsi Monastery (, "Chiprovski manastir") is a Bulgarian Orthodox monastery 5 kilometres northeast of the town of Chiprovtsi in Montana Province in northwestern Bulgaria. It belongs to the diocese of Vidin and lies in the valley of the Ogosta river.
According to Petar Bogdan, the monastery was built in the 10th century and remained a religious and cultural centre despite Tatar and Magyar raids in the 13th century, the Ottoman invasion in the 14th century and Michael the Brave's raids in the 16th century. The monastery has been razed six times, in 1412, 1688, 1806, 1828, 1837 and 1876, with the one of 1688 after the Chiprovtsi Uprising being particularly devastating. The current monastery church was built in 1829.
The Chiprovtsi Monastery consists of a church dedicated to Saint John of Rila, residential buildings, a small graveyard and a three-storey tower featuring an ossuary, a chapel and a belfry.

Txakoli de Álava

Txakoli de Álava (Basque) or Chacolí de Álava (Spanish) is a Spanish Denominación de Origen (DO) () for wines, located around the towns of Amurrio, Llodio, Artziniega, Okondo and Aiara in the province of Alava, Basque Country, Spain. 
Txacolí is a thin white acidic wine that can be naturally fizzy and is traditionally served like cider, poured from a height into the glass.
History.
This DO was created in 1989 on the initiative of the five remaining txacolí producers in the province. In that year there were only 5 ha under vines producing txacolí. However wine had traditionally been made in this manner for hundreds of years and was popular from the Middle Ages up to the end of the 19th Century, when the vines were devastated by the phylloxera virus and the effects of industrialization of the Basque Country.
Grape Varieties.
The main authorized grapes are the white Hondarrabi Zuri and black Hondarrabi Beltza, along with Petit Manseng, Gros Manseng and Petit Corbu. Almost all the vines are trained on trellises ("en espaldera") due to the high levels of rainfall and humidity in the area.

Kiss My Ankh

KISS MY ANKH: A Tribute To Vinnie Vincent is a 2008 tribute album, featuring a variety of artists covering songs written (or co-written) by Vinnie Vincent. The album consists of new recordings of songs from Vincent's careers with Kiss and the Vinnie Vincent Invasion. Featured artists include Steve Brown of Trixter, Troy Patrick Farrell of White Lion, T.J. Racer of Nitro, Sheldon Tarsha of Adler's Appetite, Chris Caffery of Savatage and Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Ryan Roxie from the Alice Cooper band and rock & roll comic C.C. Banana, who performs a parody of the Kiss song "Unholy" (rewritten as a roast of Danger Danger vocalist Ted Poley).
Name.
The album title is a play on words, combining the phrase "Kiss My Ass" (also the name of a Kiss tribute album) with a reference to the Egyptian nature of Vinnie Vincent's Kiss character (who wore a golden ankh symbol on his face).

2009 St. Louis Cardinals season

The St. Louis Cardinals' 2009 season was the 128th season for the franchise in St. Louis, Missouri and the 118th season in the National League. The Cardinals, coming off an 86-76 season and fourth place in the NL Central, got off to a strong start in April before a team-wide offensive breakdown caused them to fall behind the Cubs in the NL Central standings. Brilliant seasons from starting pitchers Chris Carpenter, Adam Wainwright, and Joel Piñeiro helped St. Louis to stay in contention until the key midseason acquisitions of Matt Holliday, Mark DeRosa, and Julio Lugo revived the Cardinal offense. An August 20–6 effectively ended the NL Central race, and the Cardinals won the division with a 91-71 record, seven-and-a-half games better than the second-place Cubs. However, their playoff run ended quickly when they were swept in three games by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Division Series.
Offseason departures and acquisitions.
Hitters.
The Cardinals retained the services of backup catcher Jason LaRue, signing him to another one-year contract.
On December 4, 2008, the Cardinals agreed to a trade with the San Diego Padres sending reliever Mark Worrell and a player-to-be-named-later (the Padres eventually chose minor-league pitcher Luke Gregerson) in exchange for shortstop Khalil Greene, who will make $6.5 mil, and will be eligible for free agency after 2009. Greene replaced César Izturis, who departed via free agency.
Utility infielder Aaron Miles, a member of the 2006 World Series champion Cardinals, signed a two-year deal on December 31 to play with the Cubs. Felipe Lopez, who became the starting second baseman after a 2008 deadline trade and hit .385 for the Cardinals in two months, became a free agent and signed with the Diamondbacks. The third and last second baseman on the 2008 Cardinals, Adam Kennedy, was given his unconditional release on February 9. With no second baseman with significant big-league experience on the roster, outfielder Skip Schumaker was tabbed to make the unusual transition. Late in training camp Schumaker was designated the official starting second baseman.
Third baseman Troy Glaus underwent right shoulder surgery on January 21, 2009, and was originally expected to miss Opening Day (April 6) and probably most of April. Glaus' progress in rehabbing his repaired right shoulder stalled, and he did not return until September (see below).
Pitchers.
Kyle Lohse, who went 15-6 with a 3.78 ERA after signing a one-year contract with the 2008 Cardinals, was re-signed to a hefty four-year, $41 mil. contract on September 29, 2008, the day after the season ended. Mark Mulder's injury-plagued time in St. Louis ended when the Cardinals declined to pick up his $11 mil. option, but instead bought out the remaining year of his contract in 2009 for $1.5 mil.
In December, the Cardinals declined to offer arbitration to relief pitchers Russ Springer and Jason Isringhausen, starter Braden Looper, and relievers Tyler Johnson and Randy Flores. St. Louis made no attempt to retain lefty reliever Ron Villone, who eventually signed with the Mets. On Dec 3, to fill the lack of left-handed relievers caused by the departure of Flores, Johnson, and Villone, they signed lefty relief specialist Trever Miller to a one-year deal potentially worth $2 million if he reaches all the incentives in the contract.
On January 5, the Cardinals signed lefty reliever Royce Ring who was with the 2008 Atlanta Braves, to a one-year contract. However, two months later the Cardinals signed Dennys Reyes, a 31-yr.-old left-handed relief specialist, to a two-year deal worth approximately $3 mil. A few weeks after the acquisition of Reyes, Ring was placed on waivers, eventually accepting an assignment to the minor leagues.
Spring Training.
St. Louis went 19-12-2 in Grapefruit League play, their most victories since they had 21 wins in 1997. Attendance at RDS was 106,266 in 18 home games (9-7-2) for an average home attendance of 5,901. In 15 road games (10-5-0), attendance 84,499; road average 5,633.
On March 30, relief pitcher Chris Perez was optioned to AAA, finalizing the pitching situation for Opening Day. Cardinals will carry 12 pitchers, including seven relievers which include long-reliever Brad Thompson. Rookie Jason Motte appeared to win the closer job, although the Cardinals made no official announcement.
Joe Mather was the final cut in spring training. Among the players making the Cardinals out of camp were utility infielders Joe Thurston and Brian Barden and two players making their big-league debuts: David Freese, who took the injured Troy Glaus' spot at third base, and former first-round draft pick (and highly anticipated prospect) Colby Rasmus. Mather's demotion left Ryan Ludwick as the only outfielder on the roster who hits right-handed.
Regular season.
April.
Opening Day 2009 looked a lot like 2008: a blown save and a bullpen loss. Rookie closer Jason Motte gave up four runs with two outs in the ninth inning, and the Pirates beat the Cardinals 6-4.
On April 7, the Cardinals beat the Pirates 9-3 as Albert Pujols hit his first home run of the season and reached base five times. As such, Pujols became only the third Cardinals player in the last 55 years to reach base four or more times in each of the first two games of the season. On April 8, the Cardinals lost to the Pirates by a score of 7-4, but Albert Pujols set the franchise record for most assists by a first baseman in a 9-inning game with seven. It was the most assists by a Major League first baseman since the National League record of eight was set in 1971. Pujols also collected his 700th career walk in the game.
On April 9, Chris Carpenter and relievers Franklin and Reyes combined on a one-hitter as the Cardinals beat Pittsburgh 2-1. It was Carpenter's first victory since Game 3 of the 2006 World Series, October 24. St. Louis followed up the Pittsburgh series with a three game sweep over Houston. In the second game of the Astro series (Apr. 11), Pujols tied a career best with seven RBI as the Cardinals won 11-2; while in the final game Kyle Lohse retired 24 consecutive batters en route to a 3-0 complete game victory.
On April 14, staff ace Chris Carpenter injured his left rib cage while batting. Early estimates were that he would miss at least a month, and it might be as long as two months. An MRI exam on April 16 revealed an oblique tear on his left side. On April 17, rookie pitcher P. J. Walters was called up from AAA-Memphis to take Carpenter's spot in the rotation.
On April 20 the Cardinals attempted to buttress a sagging bullpen by trading former Rule 5 draft pick Brian Barton for Atlanta Braves' relief pitcher Blaine Boyer. Boyer was tabbed to join the big-league club, leaving St. Louis with 13 pitchers on the 25-man roster, with David Freese optioned to Memphis.
On Saturday, April 25, in a nationally televised game on Fox, with the Cardinals leading 3-1 in the seventh inning against the Chicago Cubs, Albert Pujols hit his 8th career grand slam, helping the team win its 5th consecutive game (8-2) and solidifying their lead in the NL Central division. The slam also gave him 1,002 RBIs, making him the 260th player to reach the 1,000-level.
Brendan Ryan went to the 15-day DL with a hamstring strain on April 30, and former first-round draft pick Tyler Greene was called up to be Ryan's replacement. The Cardinals finished the month of April with a 16-7 record, best in baseball. Albert Pujols was named Player of the Month for April and Brian Barden Rookie of the Month.
May.
Center fielder Rick Ankiel ran face-first into the outfield wall while making a catch on May 4. Three days later, he was placed on the DL (retroactive to May 5), and minor-league outfielder Shane Robinson was called up to take his place on the roster. On May 12, right fielder Ryan Ludwick joined Ankiel on the DL after straining his right hamstring against the Pirates. The team recalled Nick Stavinoha from its AAA-Memphis team to take Ludwick's spot on the roster.
The injuries to Ankiel and Ludwick, combined with the continuing absence of Carpenter, contributed to a 4-10 stretch that dropped the Cardinals out of first place in the NL Central. In a showdown series between the Cardinals and Brewers May 16–18, Milwaukee swept St. Louis in St. Louis, winning three games by a combined score of 17-6. In the opener, Wainwright held the Brewers to two hits in eight innings but still lost, 1-0, on a Corey Hart home run. In the second game, Cardinal pitchers walked eight batters and hit four; in the third game, they walked eleven and hit one. Milwaukee took over first place in the Central.
On May 20, Chris Carpenter returned after missing a month with a strained oblique. Carpenter pitched five shutout innings, and the Cards won a pitching duel with the Cubs, 2-1. In his next start Carpenter was perfect for six innings, but St. Louis lost in 10 innings to Milwaukee, 1-0. Carpenter's ERA remained at 0.00 after his first four appearances. The two Carpenter starts were part of a nine-game streak for Cardinal pitching in which they held the opposition to three runs or less in every game and did not allow a home run.
On the 29th Ludwick was activated from the DL. To make room, the Cardinals put Khalil Greene on the DL with "social anxiety disorder". Greene, signed with the intention of being the everyday shortstop in 2009, played poorly in the field, was hitting .200 at the time he hit the DL, and had been playing less and less frequently in May. St. Louis went 13-14 in May and finished the month at 29-21, one game behind Milwaukee in the NL Central. The Cardinals spent the month of May in a horrific team batting slump that saw them post a .299 OBP for the month, dead last in baseball; exceptionally strong pitching in May (3.56 team ERA) helped St. Louis stay close to the top of the NL Central standings.
June.
On June 4, the Cardinals released newly acquired pitcher Blaine Boyer and called up Jess Todd to take his place. One day later, Kyle Lohse, still suffering from the aftereffects of a hit-by-pitch on his throwing forearm, May 23, went to the DL for the first time in his career, and infielder Tyler Greene recalled. The day after that (June 6), pitcher Blake Hawksworth became the 13th rookie to play for the Cardinals in 2009 (a major-league high for any team) and the seventh to make his major-league debut, when he was called up and Jess Todd was sent down.
The continuing team-wide offensive blackout reached its nadir in the second week of June, when the Colorado Rockies, second-worst team in the NL with a 21-32 record prior to the series, came to St. Louis and swept the Cardinals in four games, outscoring the Cardinals 33-9.
Khalil Greene, after three weeks on the disabled list due to anxiety disorder, was activated on June 18. In his first start since being activated, on June 19, Greene started at third base and hit a home run. He went on to hit a home run in each of his first three games back, helping the Cardinals to sweep Kansas City in Kansas City and reclaim sole possession of first place in the NL Central. However, Greene went 0 for his next 16, suffered a relapse of his social anxiety disorder, and went back on the disabled list.
On June 27, in an effort to revive a sputtering offense, the Cardinals acquired Mark DeRosa from Cleveland for Chris Perez and a player to be named later. DeRosa, who in his career has played every position but pitcher, catcher, and center field, was expected to play third base for St. Louis. One month later Cleveland selected Jess Todd to complete the deal.
A continuing inability to hit (.310 OBP for June) weighed down the Cardinals for another month: they went 12-17 for June to drop their record for 2009 to 41-38.
July.
On July 5, Albert Pujols and Yadier Molina were named as winners of the fan balloting and starters for the National League in the 80th All-Star Game. Ryan Franklin, 20 for 21 in save opportunities with a 0.84 ERA, was selected to be one of the relief pitchers. On July 14, St. Louis hosted the All-Star Game for the first time in 43 years. The AL beat the NL 4-3. Albert Pujols was 0-for-3 with an error that led to an AL run, Yadier Molina had an RBI single, and Ryan Franklin pitched a scoreless inning.
After appearing in only three games for St. Louis, new addition Mark DeRosa went onto the disabled list (retroactive to July 1) on July 7, suffering from a strained wrist. However, the rest of the Cardinals, buoyed by Pujols, a hot Colby Rasmus, and a resurgent Ryan Ludwick, went 6-4 on their ten-game road trip before the break, and entered the All-Star break with a 49-42 record and a 2.5 game lead in the NL Central.
The middle of July saw major changes to the Cardinals lineup. On July 18, Mark DeRosa, suffering from a torn tendon sheath in his wrist that eventually required offseason surgery, was reactivated from the DL and returned to the starting lineup. Four days later, Chris Duncan, one of the few remaining players from the 2006 world champion Cardinals, was traded to the Boston Red Sox for shortstop Julio Lugo, along with a player-to-be-named-later or cash; and the team recalled Brian Barden. Two days after that, on July 24, the Cardinals traded three prospects, including their #1 prospect, third baseman Brett Wallace, pitcher Clayton Mortensen, and outfielder Shane Peterson, for Oakland Athletics outfielder Matt Holliday.
On July 28, Todd Wellemeyer was demoted to the bullpen. Mitchell Boggs was called up from AAA-Memphis to take his July 31 start. At the time of the move, Wellemeyer's 5.79 ERA was second-worst in the National League among players with enough innings to qualify for the ERA title.
Buoyed by the arrival of Holliday and Lugo plus the return of DeRosa to the lineup and a hot Rick Ankiel, the Cardinals won six of their last nine games in July, and went 16-11 for the month. They ended July 1/2 game ahead of the Cubs in the NL Central. Ryan Ludwick earned honors as the National League Player of the Month for July, after batting
.340 with 6 HR's and a league-high 28 RBI. The Cardinals have had the NL's top player three of the first four months with Albert Pujols winning the award in both April and June.
August.
Albert Pujols tied the all-time NL season record set by Ernie Banks in 1955 by hitting his fifth grand slam of the year, (and his second HR of the game) on August 4 at New York. Pujols' slam was the exclamation point in a 12-7, 10-inning victory, in which Pujols went 4-for-5 with five RBIs and three runs scored. The Cardinals previously forced extra innings by rallying for two runs in the ninth off Mets' ace closer Francisco Rodríguez.
After briefly returning to the starting rotation, Todd Wellemeyer went on the DL with elbow inflammation. Mitchell Boggs was again tabbed to take his place in the rotation. Later in the month, starting pitcher Kyle Lohse joined him on the DL with a strained groin.
The team came to terms and signed their #1 draft pick, pitcher Shelby Miller, on August 17, just hours before the deadline.
John Smoltz signed with the team on August 19 as a probable fifth starter and also possible reliever after the Red Sox released him. In his first start, against San Diego, Smoltz threw five scoreless innings, striking out nine, and got the win.
The Cardinals played some of their best baseball of the season in the middle of August. Consecutive series victories against Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, San Diego, and Los Angeles, plus a win in the first game of another series with San Diego, pushed St. Louis to 17 games over .500 at 70-53, the furthest over .500 the franchise had reached since the 2005 team went 100-62. St. Louis opened up a six-game lead over the second-place Cubs during this stretch.
A 7-0 victory from Chris Carpenter, giving him an NL-tying 14th win, over San Diego at Petco Park on August 22, was the unofficial 10,000th win in franchise history. The official total (9,219) is lower because the Cardinals franchise does not count its ten years in the American Association in its all-time statistics.
On August 28, Albert Pujols hit his eighth career walk-off home run in John Smoltz's first home game at Busch Stadium in a 3-2 win over Washington.
A sweep of the Nationals ended one of the best Augusts in franchise history. The Cardinals went 20-6 for the month, pushing their overall record to 22 games over .500 at 77-55, and opening up a ten-game lead over the Cubs. They did not lose a series all month. Albert Pujols had a 1.092 OPS for the month while Matt Holliday, whose acquisition at the end of July coincided with the sudden takeoff of the Cardinals, posted a .963 OPS for August. Aces Adam Wainwright and Chris Carpenter had ERAs of 1.30 and 2.20 for August. Closer Ryan Franklin did not allow a run all month. Wainwright's 2-1 win over the Nationals on August 30 made him MLB's first 16-game winner. Carpenter was named the NL's Pitcher of the Month for August.
September/October.
Third baseman Troy Glaus, out all year with a shoulder injury, became the first September call-up after maximum roster size expanded to 40. Adam Wainwright was touched for six runs in five innings by the Pirates but still earned his league-leading 17th victory on September 4. Albert Pujols hit only his second career pinch-hit home run in the 10th for a dramatic 2-1 game-winner over the Pirates, at PNC Park, September 5.
Chris Carpenter threw a one-hitter on September 7 against the Brewers at Miller Park, striking out 10, earning his first shutout since September 11, 2006, and reaching 1,300 career strikeouts.
A three-game sweep by the Braves September 11–13 marked the first time St. Louis had lost a series since July 24–26 against Philadelphia, and the first time the Cardinals lost the opening game of a series since July 20 against Houston.
After the Memphis Redbirds' season ended with a loss in the AAA National Championship Game, the Cardinals announced four more September call-ups: David Freese, Tyler Greene, Josh Kinney, and Matt Pagnozzi. Pagnozzi, nephew to former Cardinals All-Star catcher Tom Pagnozzi, first appeared in a game on September 29, becoming the tenth player to make his big-league debut with the 2009 Cardinals. The other nine rookies were Freese, Greene, P. J. Walters, Shane Robinson, Jarrett Hoffpauir, Colby Rasmus, Blake Hawksworth, Clayton Mortensen, and Jess Todd.
The Cardinals finally clinched the NL Central championship at Colorado (September 26), with their 90th win, 6-3, on a tie-breaking home run by replacement catcher Jason LaRue in the 7th inning.
Ryan Ludwick later added a pinch-hit 2-run home run in the 9th inning. Adam Wainwright got his NL-leading 19th win, going 8 innings with 130 pitches, giving up 10 hits, walking one, and striking out 11. It was the Cardinals' seventh NL division championship in the last ten seasons, and eighth for manager Tony La Russa in 14 seasons as Cardinal manager, although one championship was a shared one with Houston in 2001.
On October 1, Chris Carpenter threw five shutout innings in a 13-0 victory over Cincinnati. Carpenter finished his season with a 17-4 record. He lowered his ERA to 2.24, securing his first ERA title and the first ERA title for any Cardinal since Joe Magrane was National League ERA champion in 1988. Carpenter also hit the first home run of his big league career, a grand slam, and drove in six runs to double his career RBI total.
In that same game Carpenter pitched (Oct 1, 2009), Tony La Russa passed John McGraw for second-most games managed in baseball with his 4,770th game managed (2,552-2,214-4). La Russa gets three more games (October 4) to extend his managed games to 4,773 (2,552-2,217-4) by the end of the 2009 season.
The next night, a bullpen collapse robbed Adam Wainwright of his chance to be the only 20-game winner in baseball, but Wainwright still finished as the National League leader in wins, with a 19-8 record and a 2.63 ERA.
The Cardinals finished the 2009 season losing 8 of their last 10 and 14 of their last 21 to go 91-71 for the year. Albert Pujols won his first home run title with 47, despite not homering after September 9. He also broke the all-time single-season record for assists by a first baseman with his record 185th in the last game.
On October 5, Chris Carpenter was named NL Comeback Player of the Year (second time) for his superb season, after leading the NL with a 2.24 ERA and an .810 winning percentage (17-4).
Postseason.
Division Series.
In the 2009 National League Division Series, St. Louis faced off against the Los Angeles Dodgers, NL West champions. The Cardinals went 5-2 against the Dodgers in the regular season, and were the favorites in the National League, but the Dodgers swept the Cardinals in three games to bring St. Louis' 2009 season to a quick end. It was only the second time in eight trips to the postseason that a LaRussa-led Cardinals team lost in the first round.
Awards.
Adam Wainwright and Yadier Molina won Gold Gloves, the first for Wainwright and second for Molina. Albert Pujols won the Silver Slugger Award as the best hitting first baseman in the NL, and the Hank Aaron Award as the best hitter in the National League. In a close race, Wainwright finished third in voting (90 pts.) for the Cy Young Award despite getting the most first place votes (12). Chris Carpenter finished second (94 pts.), six points behind winner Tim Lincecum. Albert Pujols won his second consecutive Most Valuable Player award, winning all 32 first place votes.

Lars Hall (art director)

Lars Christer Hall (born 1938 in Stockholm, Sweden) is a Swedish advertiser and art director.
Biography.
It was an art teacher in primary school that suggested that Lars Hall should apply to "Konstfackskolan" (now called Konstfack, University College of Arts, Crafts and Design) in Stockholm. He started at age 15, worked as a freelance during his studies, and graduated in 1960. After his studies, Hall worked for a number of agencies, and also at the Stockholm newspaper Dagens Nyheter. While working for Arbman, at that time a large advertising agency in Sweden, he met copywriter Jan Cederquist, with whom he started the agency "Hall & Cederquist" in 1973.
Hall & Cederquist’s role model was the New York agency DDB (Doyle, Dane & Bernach), with their new, intelligent style of advertising, placing creativity before commerce. After having won most national awards available, Hall & Cederquist became one of the first agencies to receive "Platinaägget" in 1978, the finest award in Swedish advertising.
In 1989, Hall & Cederquist was bought by American Young & Rubicam, creating the largest ad agency in Sweden, and Lars Hall quit in mid-1990s, taking a couple of years off duty at his house in Stockholm’s archipelago. In 1997 he started Lars Hall AB, working in the broad fields of advertising, corporate identeties, packaging design, interior design, and book design. In 2009, Hall had to dismiss most employees due to decreasing clients and commissions.
Hall’s interest in photography led him and Cederquist to start the art photography gallery "Camera Obscura", located in Gamla stan in Stockholm. The gallery held exhibitions of among others Christer Strömholm, Diane Arbus, and Irving Penn. Hall is also known for having one of Sweden's most extensive photo collections.

Another Planet / Voyager

"Another Planet" / "Voyager" is the second single by Australian drum and bass band Pendulum. It was released on 23 February 2004 by independent label Breakbeat Kaos, and was their first single to use the 12" picture disc format. The single peaked at number 46 in the UK Singles Chart, and reached number one in the UK Dance Chart.
The song "Another Planet" contains samples from Jeff Wayne's musical version of "The War of the Worlds", and was included on the CD edition of "Hold Your Colour" when it was released in July 2005. Both tracks appeared on the compilation album "".
Background and writing.
Unlike every other single released by Pendulum to date, "Another Planet" / "Voyager" was written and produced in full by all members of the band, which at that time included Rob Swire, Paul Harding and Gareth McGrillen. The song "Another Planet" uses samples from Jeff Wayne's musical version of "The War of the Worlds", including several samples of dialogue by Richard Burton.
McGrillen had developed a fear of "The War of the Worlds" when he was quite young, to the extent that he could not look at the album cover. Years later, while he was working on one song with Swire, he decided to face his fear by travelling home and returning with his father's copy, which they then sampled for the song. One of the samples they used contained a line spoken by Burton, "...and I wandered through the weird and lurid landscape of another planet", which later gave the song its name.
Critical reception.
"Another Planet / Voyager" was the first single by Pendulum to receive widespread recognition, and as such was subject to critical attention. One review of the single describes "Voyager" as "a really well done piece of dancefloor drum and bass action", and says that "Pendulum have coined their own recognisable sound, but manage to stay fresh at the same time". "Another Planet" in particular has received a wide range of criticism, partially due to its placement on two albums, and has been described both as "conventional and bass, being largely instrumental and synth based", and as a "crowd favourite ... sounds far too serious for that goofy, bouncy bassline to work".
Marketing and release.
"Another Planet" / "Voyager" was released on 23 February 2004 in two formats, a standard 12" single and a 12" picture disc, the first of several singles by Pendulum to use this format. It was also their first release with independent drum and bass label Breakbeat Kaos, which remained their main label for the next three years.
"Another Planet" was featured on the CD edition of "Hold Your Colour", released in July 2005, but was later replaced by the song "Blood Sugar" after the album was reissued. It was also featured on the mix album "Fabric Live 22", alongside Pendulum's remix of Nightbreed's "Pack of Wolves". An alternative version of the song, titled "Another Planet (VIP)", was produced and released on the "Bass Invaderz" compilation album. Both tracks from the single were also included in another compilation album – "Jungle Sound - the Bassline Strikes Back!" – released in October 2004.
Chart performance.
"Another Planet" / "Voyager" was the first single by Pendulum to appear in the UK Singles Chart. It entered the chart on 6 March 2004, peaking at number 46, and remained in the chart for a total of two weeks. The single also performed well in the UK Dance Chart, remaining at number one for two weeks on 6 March and 13 March.

Back 2 You / Still Grey

"Back 2 You" / "Still Grey" is the third single by Australian drum and bass band Pendulum. It was released on 22 March 2004 by independent label Timeless Recordings, and was their first and only release with the label. The song "Still Grey" featured guest guitarist Evan Short of Concord Dawn, and was included on the CD edition of "Hold Your Colour", released in July 2005.
Background and writing.
Both tracks of "Back 2 You" / "Still Grey" were written and produced by Rob Swire and Paul Harding, "Back 2 You" was also written and produced by Gareth McGrillen. The single was the first release by Pendulum to feature either a guest instrumentalist, or a guest vocalist. The song "Back 2 You" featured singer Lisa Lindt, while the electric guitar in "Still Grey" was played by Evan Killjoy, better known as Evan Short of New Zealand drum and bass duo Concord Dawn.
Critical reception.
Unlike Pendulum's previous single, "Back 2 You" / "Still Grey" did not receive much publicity or recognition, and consequently neither track has been subject to many critical reviews. This is particularly true of "Back 2 You", which has not been featured on any studio or compilation album released by Pendulum to date. One review of "Hold Your Colour" describes "Still Grey" as "chilled but entertaining", although the reviewer gripes that "after such a powerful intro, was hoping for a dramatic exeunt and what they deliver is a cool fade out". Another review describes the song as "a fantastic piece of liquid dancefloor action".
Marketing and release.
"Back 2 You" / "Still Grey" was released on 22 March 2004 as a standard 12" single by independent label Timeless Recordings. It was Pendulum's first and only release with the label to date, which has also released material for guest guitarist Evan Short's band, Concord Dawn. The song "Still Grey" was featured on the CD edition of "Hold Your Colour", released in July 2005, but was later replaced by the song "Axle Grinder" when the album was reissued in July 2007.

It peaked number 34 on the UK Singles chart. Both songs have been included on their CD release of "Hold Your Colour" in July 2005.

In the end of the video, where the man is wearing a Pendulum / Breakbeat Kaos shirt, he gets his stereo and his bag stolen; in an attempt to try to get them back, the man accidentally slams into a street pole, ending the song. The video also features cameo appearances by the members of Pendulum.

Gary Berntson is professor at Ohio State University with appointments in the departments of psychology, psychiatry and pediatrics. He is an expert in psychophysiology, neuroscience, biological psychology, and with his colleague John Cacioppo, a founding father of social neuroscience. 
His research attempts to elucidate the functional organization of brain mechanisms underlying behavioral and affective processes, with a special emphasis on social cognition.
Background.
Berntson studied biology and psychology at the University of Minnesota, and was awarded a Ph.D. (psychobiology and life sciences) in 1971. He then worked as a post-doc fellow with Neal Miller at Rockefeller University in the department of psychology between 1971-1973. Since 1973, Berntson is on the faculty at the Ohio State University.
Research interests.
The broad interest of Berntson's program is in the elucidation of the functional organization of brain mechanisms underlying behavioral and affective processes, with a special emphasis on social neuroscience. The program is guided conceptually by a recognition of the importance of multiple levels of analyzes in a meaningful understanding of complex neurobehavioral relations, and the strategic approach is collaborative and multidisciplinary in nature. This is illustrated by current research on anxiety and autonomic control, which ranges from basic animal studies of central neural and neuropharmacological mechanisms, to human research that examines the links between psychological processes and autonomic as well as immune functions. Central to this program of research is an effort to understand, at a theoretical level, the organizational principles that characterize psychobiological relations. Recent collaborative research includes: a) the role of cognitive and social factors in autonomic regulation and immune functions, b) contribution of cortical/cognitive processes to anxiety, and the neural systems that mediate these relations, c) the impact of autonomic states on higher neural systems, d) the integrative organization of neurobehavioral, neuroendocrine, autonomic and immune systems, and e) psychoneuroimmunology and the social neuroscience of health and disease.

Ageratina adenophora

Ageratina adenophora (syn. "Eupatorium adenophorum") is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family known by many common names, including eupatory, sticky snakeroot, crofton weed, and Mexican devil.
Description.
"Ageratina adenophora" is a perennial herbaceous shrub that may grow to high. It has opposite trowel-shaped serrated leaves that are long by in width. The small compound flowers occur in late spring and summer, and are found in clusters at the end of branches. Each flowerhead is up to 0.5 cm in the diameter and creamy white in colour. They are followed by a small brown seed with a white feathery 'parachute'.
Distribution and habitat.
It is native to Mexico, but it is known in many other parts of the world as an introduced species and often a noxious weed. It has caused great economic loss in agriculture in southwestern China, and is threatening the native biodiversity there. It was first inadvertently introduced to Yunnan around 1940, and its rapid spread is due in part to its allelopathic competition with other plant species. It also a weed in Australia, where it was introduced to Sydney in 1904. It has spread along the coastline of New South Wales and southern Queensland. It is rated a "Class 4 Noxious Weed" under the NSW Noxious Weeds Act of 1993.
"Ageratina adenophora" has also spread in Hawaii and the mainland USA, where it is recognised as a weed in ten states of the South and Southwest.
Elsewhere it is an invasive species in many tropical and subtropical countries, including northeastern India, China, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, the Canary Islands, and South Africa.
The plant can spread vegetatively, that is the stems can sprout roots and grow upon contact with earth. The seed is also carried by the wind or water and colonises disturbed areas, such as fields and areas near human habitation, readily. Seed may also be transported on animals and in soil.

Lawrence Morgan

Lawrence "Laurie" Morgan (5 February 1915 – 19 August 1997) was an Australian sportsman who is the only person to play VFL/AFL football and win an Olympic Gold Medal. He played his Australian rules football with Fitzroy during the late 1930s and won two gold medals in equestrian at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.
Morgan was born in the country and, as a child, raced horses over tree branches with his friend, fellow Olympic equestrian competitor Bill Roycroft. When he came to Fitzroy in 1937 he played in the same side as the great Haydn Bunton. He spent two further seasons at Fitzroy, both under coach Gordon Rattray, before leaving.
Morgan returned to the sporting scene in 1960, at the age of 45, when he competed for the Australian equestrian team at the Rome Olympics. Riding his horse 'Salad Days', Morgan won a Gold Medal ahead of countryman Neale Lavis in the Individual Three-Day Event to become the first Australian to win an equestrian gold medal. The former VFL player then teamed up with Lavis and Bill Roycroft to win Gold in the Team Event, best remembered for Roycroft's heroics in riding despite suffering concussion and severe injuries from a previous fall. 
Although the Australian Olympic team consisted of big names like Herb Elliott, Dawn Fraser and Murray Rose, Morgan was the only dual Gold Medalist.
Morgan's biography, entitled "Too Tough To Lose", was recently completed by his son Warwick Morgan, himself an accomplished horseman, and published in 2012 by Forty Degrees South Publishing (see External Links).

Tourism.
Meghma as the name suggest is covered by clouds most of the time. The tourist or the guests entering Meghma is welcomed by the Buddhist monastery because the cloud is a magician here which conceals and reveals the monastery. Built in early nineties, it is one of the prominent monasteries of the region because it treasures 108 forms of Buddha. These 108 Buddhas are believed to be encountered in ones journey from this world to the next world (Sukhawati Bhavan) depending on his Karma.
Meghma is the most suitable place to take a rest and probably the best place to take the first halt to prepare for a long Singalila Trek. It is situated about 4 hours of trekking from Manebhanjan.
Economy.
The main source of income is from agriculture and people here grow a number of vegetables namely Carrot, Turnip, Potato, Cabbage,Radish, Beet Root and Celery. Apart from this people produce cheese and butter from cow milk. They find Maneybhanjang as the nearest market to sell off their goods but, if they can sell it in Darjeeling they fetch more money.

Vincenzo Licciardi

Vincenzo Licciardi (born June 27, 1965) is the boss of the Licciardi clan, and one of the main leaders of the Secondigliano Alliance, a Camorra crime syndicate operating in Naples and the surrounding Campania region. His nickname is ""'o Chiatto"" (Fatso).
Biography.
Early career.
Born and raised in the Neapolitan suburb of Secondigliano, Licciardi was from a powerful family of Camorristi going back a few generations. His father was a well known "guappo" or local boss in the 1950s. In 1994, Licciardi became the regent of the Licciardi clan whose traditional strongholds included not only its home base in the district of Secondigliano, but also to Scampia, Chiaiano, Miano and San Pietro a Patierno. The clan was previously headed by his brother, Gennaro Licciardi, nicknamed ""'a scigna"" (The monkey), who died of blood poisoning while in the prison of Voghera on August 3, 1994. 
However, an arrest in the mid-nineties prevented him from taking control and propelled his sister Maria Licciardi into the top spot as boss of the Licciardi clan, and therefore, as head of the Secondigliano Alliance, a coalition of powerful Camorra clans which controls drug trafficking and the extortion rackets against shopkeepers in many Neapolitan suburbs. Under her leadership, the Secondigliano Alliance become more organized, secretive, sophisticated and consequently more powerful.
Camorra boss.
After the arrest of his sister on June 15, 2001, Licciardi took over as a supreme head of the Secondigliano Alliance along with Paolo Di Lauro and Edoardo Contini. Apart from the dominant Licciardi clan, the alliance consisted of the Contini, Di Lauro, Mallardo and Lo Russo clans. The preceding gang wars between the many Camorra clans that constituted the alliance, led to a severe weakening of the confederation as well as unwanted police attention on its activities. Like his sister, Vincenzo was very cautious and never used the phone to communicate with his underlings, instead using small handwritten encrypted notes, similar to the Pizzini used by the Corleonesi boss, Bernardo Provenzano. Throughout his reign, Licciardi's main activity covered the illegal trafficking of clothing, which due to a sophisticated international network, which has also allowed the laundering of money from other criminal activities such as drug trafficking and extortion.
Evading justice.
Licciardi became wanted by the Italian police in 2003, after having served a year in prison for a previous conviction. The following year, in July 2004, an arrest warrant was issued against him for conspiracy to commit murder, and a list of other crimes. He was also added to the list of thirty most dangerous fugitives in Italy. In 2005, an international warrant was issued and his name was included in the "special program of research" in the direction of the Central Criminal Police. While a fugitive, Licciardi had managed to evade capture on at least three occasions, once fleeing through the network of sewers. Several sightings of Licciardi were reported abroad, particularly in Portugal, Spain and France. He allegedly travelled to these places in order to maintain contacts with the Magliari clan, which controls many drug routes in Europe.
Capture.
After five years on the run, Licciardi was arrested on February 7, 2008, in Cuma, near the city of Naples. He was found hiding in the apartment of distant relatives, where he lived with his wife. During his arrest, he surrendered peacefully and offered no resistance. The detection of the hide-out was made possible through the use of sophisticated technologies. Licciardi's arrest came around the same time as that of a massive anti-Mafia sweep in Italy and the United States. A large anti-Mafia operation code-named "Old Bridge" involved arrest warrants issued against a total of ninety mafiosi and mob associates of key Italian and US families who controlled drug trafficking between the two sides of the Atlantic. 
When Licciardi was escorted to prison by police officials, there was a turmoil by Licciardi's relatives as well as the relatives of other Camorristi, shouting, jostling and moments of tension. After his arrest, Licciardi was succeeded by Gennaro Cirelli as boss of the clan.
Piero Grasso, the national anti-Mafia prosecutor commented: "Licciardi's arrest is another success in the capture of fugitives of opposing clans that were involved in the feud in Secondigliano in recent years. There has moved forward in the complete destruction of the clan that up to today have caused dozens of deaths in the streets of Naples. The capture of Licciardi, for the brilliant way in which it was executed by the police, represents a step forward in the fight against the Camorra."
Aftermath.
On June 15, 2008, his younger sister Patrizia and his brother-in-law Eduardo Marano, known as "dino dinuccio" were arrested by the Carabinieri and charged with the extortion of an entrepreneur from Casoria. The entrepreneur was contemplating suicide, and had complained to the Carabinieri of the extortion attempt. The two had long been controlled by the policemen who were later arrested, due to the entrepreneur's collaboration.
On July 9, 2008, five months after his arrest, 44 people linked to the Licciardi clan were arrested in a raid by the Naples police. The 44 people arrested were accused of conspiracy to murder, drug trafficking, possession of weapons, forgery and attempted aggravated robbery. Vincenzo Licciardi, who was already in prison at the time, was also charged with the aforementioned crimes. The blitz was conducted as a result of investigations that led to the arrest of Vincenzo Licciardi. 
An anti-Camorra raid was also undertaken by the Guardia di Finanza in Naples and the surrounding town of Frosinone, who seized property, commercial companies, shares of stakes in companies, apartments, buildings, land, cars, motorcycles, with a total estimated value of 300 million euros. In the aftermath of the raids, the police implemented an order for remand in prison handed down by the prosecution of Naples, at the request of local anti-Mafia directorate, against Licciardi and several affiliated criminal organizations that control the drug trafficking and extortion rackets in North Naples.

7mm Winchester Short Magnum

The 7mm Winchester Short Magnum (also known as the 7mm WSM) is a centrefire cartridge developed in partnership with Browning Arms Company and Winchester ammunition, making its debut and introduced to the shooting public in 2001. 
Specifications.
The 7mm WSM is similar to the .300 WSM and .270 WSM cases necked down to handle .284" bullets. However, the distance from the casehead to the datum line on the shoulder is longer for the 7WSM, preventing accidental chambering or firing of the .284" 7mm bullet in .270 WSM's .277" bore. Winchester claims a muzzle velocity (MV) of 3,225 ft/s with a 140 grain bullet for their 7mm WSM cartridge; the claimed muzzle energy (ME) is 3,233 ft. lbs. With a 160 grain bullet the Winchester figures are 2990 ft/s and 3176 ft. lbs. at the muzzle. The lighter, shorter 7mm bullets are preferred in these short case magnums. 
Performance.
The 7mm WSM cartridge achieves its useful purpose as an excellent cartridge for larger mule deer, sheep, black bear and elk.

The series centers around Shirley Simmons (Hemphill), a sharp-tongued taxicab driver who inherits controlling interest in the multimillion dollar conglomerate Grayson Enterprises at the death of its founder, Jonathan Grayson, one of Shirley's regular fares. Gleefully assuming her position as CEO, she declares war on 'pompous stuffed shirts', especially company vice president Roland Cushing (Keene Curtis). She finds an ally in Nancy (Dorothy Fielding), Grayson's secretary. The series was set in New York City.

Brachylophus bulabula

Brachylophus bulabula is a species of iguanid lizard endemic to some of the larger central and northwestern islands of Fiji (Ovalau, Gau, Kadavu and Viti Levu), where it occurs in Fijian wet forest. It was discovered by a team led by a scientist from the Australian National University in 2008. It is one of the few species of iguanas found outside of the New World and one of the most geographically isolated members of the family Iguanidae.
Taxonomy and etymology.
The generic name, "Brachylophus", is derived from two Greek words: brachys (βραχῦς) meaning "short" and lophos (λοφος) meaning "crest" or "plume", denoting the short spiny crests along the back of this species. The specific name, "bulabula", is a doubling of the Fiji word for "hello": "bula".
The species is closely related to the Fiji banded iguana and the Fiji crested iguana. This species was described after a mitochondrial DNA analysis of 61 iguanas from 13 islands showed that "B. bulabula" was genetically and physically different from the two other species.
All three species have been suggested to have evolved from iguanas that crossed, in part over dry land bridges, to Fiji from Southeast Asia. It has also been suggested that the ancestors of these iguanas rafted 9000 km west across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, where their closest relatives are found.

In 1996 Williams submitted a patent, , for a variable-length data partitioning system that has since become the basis for data deduplication technology in the computer data storage industry.
In 2001, Williams founded the data integrity and data storage company Rocksoft Pty Ltd. With Williams as chairman and chief architect, Rocksoft developed the deduplication technology to a commercial product. In 2006, Rocksoft was sold to ADIC which was in turn immediately acquired by Quantum Corporation.
In 2007, Williams' patent became the subject of legal action between Quantum Corporation and Riverbed Technology.
Since exiting Rocksoft, Williams founded, along with associate David Sag, "Carbon Planet Pty Ltd", a carbon credits auditing, origination, and retailing company.

Silesian Guitar Octet

Silesian Guitar Octet is the only performing octet in the world that has a stable structure. The Octet consists of professors, graduates and students of Musical Academy in Katowice, Poland.
The octet.
The musical group was created in 2001 by Franciszek Wieczorek. In the beginning there was an idea to put together as many guitars as possible and at the same time not to create a guitar orchestra. Originally, each of the guitarists should have his or her own part. Later on, the number of guitarists has become eight.
The group received first prize at the international festival INTER ARTIA (Greece) 2008.
The Silesian Guitar Octet has recorded for BBC WORLDS television and Polish Radio.
The first album of the group, entitled "OCT.OPUS", was nominated to win the Polish music award FRYDERYKI in 2009. The second album of the group, "The XXth Century", was released in January 2011.
The Silesian Guitar Octet has appeared in numerous concerts in Poland as well as in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Slovakia, Sweden, Austria, Greece, Italy and in the UK.
Repertoire.
There are very few pieces which are originally written for an octet. Because of this, Franciszek Wieczorek has had to carry out the transcription of many beautiful pearls for the orchestra music.
The groups core repertoire consists of works by J.S. Bach, W.A. Mozart, P.I. Tchaikovsky, E. Grieg, M. Ravel, J. Turina, G. Gershwin, A. Khachaturian, L. Bernstein, L. Brouwer, R. Dyens and many others.

1971 New York Giants season

The 1971 New York Giants season was the 47th season for the club in the National Football League (NFL). The Giants had a 4–10 record for the season and finished in last place in the National Football Conference East Division.
The Giants selected Rocky Thompson in the 1971 NFL Draft, with the 18th overall pick. After a winless preseason, New York began the regular season with a 2–1 record before posting a 2–9 mark in its final 11 games. The team was affected by numerous injuries, including a thigh injury suffered by running back Ron Johnson, who had gained more than 1,000 yards rushing in 1970. The 1971 season was the last for quarterback Fran Tarkenton with the Giants; after he requested a trade, the Giants dealt him to the Minnesota Vikings in 1972 for three players and a pair of draft picks.

Kip (trampolining)

In trampolining a kip is a skill mostly used by coaches while helping performers developing new skills.
In such circumstances an experienced coach will either stand, or bounce, alongside the performer and by timing their actions in the bed will be able to either increase, decrease, or simply stabilise the level of bounce experienced by the performer.
The Kip action itself occurs while the coach is in contact with the trampoline bed; they will bend their knees and then depress the bed downwards either:

Although strongly discouraged in competitive trampoline clubs for safety reasons, the kipping action is used in a number of games played on trampolines such as "crack the egg"

Circumscription (taxonomy)

In biological taxonomy, circumscription is the definition of the limits of a taxonomic group of organisms, a taxon. For every taxon the circumscription is based on a set of attributes that characterise every member of the taxon, and exclude every other organism. 
One goal of biological taxonomy is to achieve a stable circumscription for every taxon. Achieving stability is not yet a certainty in most taxa, and many that had been regarded as stable for decades are in upheaval in the light of rapid developments in molecular phylogenetics. In essence new discoveries may invalidate the application of irrelevant attributes used in established or obsolete circumscriptions, or present new attributes useful in cladistic taxonomy. 
An example of a taxonomic group with unstable circumscription is Anacardiaceae, a family of flowering plants. Some experts favor a circumscription in which this family includes the Blepharocaryaceae, Julianaceae, and Podoaceae, which are sometimes considered to be separate families.

It was first described in 1913 for an occurrence in Grotta dell'Allume, Porto Levante, Vulcano Island, Lipari, Aeolian Islands, Sicily. It was named for Italian mineralogist Federico Millosevich (1875–1942) of the University of Rome.
The mineral is mainly known from burning coal dumps, acting as one of the main minerals forming sulfate crust. It can be also found in volcanic solfatara environments.
It occurs with native sulfur, sal ammoniac, letovicite, alunogen and boussingaultite.

Marketing supply chain

The marketing supply chain is the chain of suppliers that an organization relies on to produce marketing materials (print, promotional products and point of sale) to market their products and services.
The marketing supply chain is often made up of partners inside and outside of the organization – such as brand managers, marketing services, agencies, direct sales teams, buyers, printers, fulfillment houses and many others.
From product brochures and promotional flyers to point-of-sale systems and store signage, each of these supplies must be acquired, managed and distributed to customers, sales teams, branch offices, retail outlets, dealers, distributors and other key audiences around the world.
Flow.
Similar to manufacturing environments, marketing supply chains are primarily governed by a process or "flow" that typically involves:
Over time, most supply chains can grow cumbersome and unwieldy as new partners, new products and new technologies are added, resulting in increased cost, decreased service levels and an overall loss of control. Some of the world’s largest consulting firms estimate that up to 60% of marketing costs are related to non-product ancillary areas (distribution, people, freight, storage, obsolescence, technology, inventory management, etc.).
Companies have tackled cost reduction from a "largest spend first" philosophy. As a result, some very substantial cost savings opportunities are often overlooked, such as indirect materials and supplies – those products and services that are not a core or direct part of the company’s finished product.
By taking a complete marketing supply chain approach, identifying inefficiencies and developing best business practices, companies can improve their marketing supply chain process. Outsourcing the process can help manage total marketing supply chain cost, and can provide an opportunity for measurement in marketing, one of the major challenges in the profession.

Logan Young

Logan Young (1940–2006) was a Memphis, Tennessee businessman and a booster for the University of Alabama football program. In 2005, Young was found guilty in federal court for charges relating to his role in a scheme to pay a high school football coach $150,000 to help recruit a player to Alabama.
Personal.
Young attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, during which time he befriended legendary Alabama football coach, Bear Bryant, through his father. Young inherited an Arkansas food manufacturing company and owned the Memphis Showboats, a United States Football League team in the 1980s.
Alabama scandal.
NCAA sanctions.
During the 2000 season, an assistant football coach at Trezevant High School in Memphis claimed that Young had paid Lynn Lang, the Trezevant head football coach, approximately $150,000 to encourage defensive lineman Albert Means to sign with Alabama. Following the investigation by the NCAA, Alabama received a five-year probation, a two-year bowl ban, and a reduced number of scholarships that the university could award—limiting them by twenty-one scholarships over the next three years.
Alabama sanctions.
Amid fears that the NCAA was considering hitting the school with a "death penalty," which would have shut down the football team for at least one year, Alabama permanently disassociated itself from Young in 2000. Alabama not only banned him from any involvement with the athletic program, but stripped him of his $40,000 luxury box at Bryant-Denny Stadium and canceled an insurance policy that would have paid $500,000 toward the Paul "Bear" Bryant Museum on campus upon Young's death.
Young was convicted in federal court on conspiracy to commit racketeering, crossing state lines to commit racketeering, and arranging bank withdrawals to cover up a crime. Young's defense claimed Lang, who was also convicted of a racketeering conspiracy, was motivated to testify against Young in exchange for a lighter sentence. He was eventually sentenced to six months in jail, though he continued to firmly deny any wrongdoing.
Death.
On April 11, 2006, Young was found dead in his home in Memphis. Originally thought to be a homicide, local police concluded that Young's death was accidental.

The attacks started in response to forced conversions, land grabbing and distribution of inflammatory literature targeting Hindu gods by the New Life Church - a fringe Protestant group operating in the state. The Catholic churches while denying any association with the group have joined the Hindus in condemning the activities of the New Life Church. The denials of New Life Church however, has been seen as "unconvincing" so far At the same time, the Bishop of Mangalore Diocese reiterated that the Catholic Church has never been involved in forced conversions.
Satya Darshini.
At the heart of the attacks were charges of the distribution of the "Satya Darshini", a Kannada book containing inflammatory material denigrating Hindu gods and which irked Hindu groups. The book, originally published as "Ruju Darshini" in Telugu by the 'Karunamaya Ministries' more than a decade earlier had in fact been banned after it had sparked off communal riots in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh in 1998. Rev. Paravasthu Suryanarayana, the pastor of the 'Karunamaya Ministries' is reported to be the author of the Telugu original. The book is said to have been translated by a certain Sriramreddy of Bangalore, and revised by Rev Samson S Malekar of Davangere. A G Prakash of Suvarta Sevadal, Bellary reportedly edited it.
The New Life Church however, flatly denies all allegations of publishing, printing or distributing the book.
The violence.
On 14 September 2008, about 20 churches were allegedly vandalized in Mangalore, Udupi, Chikkamagaluru, and in other districts of Karnataka. The Assailants had damaged Catholic Churches, Protestant churches and Kingdom Halls belonging to Jehovah’s Witnesses groups. The violence soon spread to Kolar, Dakshina Kannada and minor damage was reported from the state border of Kasaragod in Kerala.
On 15 September, violence erupted in the aftermath of serial attacks on churches and missionary prayer halls in the coastal areas of Karnataka escalated as four persons were attacked and Christians resorted to violent protests in which more than 40 persons were injured.
On 21 September, two more churches in Bangalore were attacked. 
Iron rods were used to break into a church in Mariyannana Palya. The eucharist was desecrated, and furniture damaged. The donation chest was broken, and Rs. 1,000 [$20] stolen. In all, the cost of the damage was Rs. 18,000 [$360].
The second attack took place in Rajarajeshwari Nagar in west Bangalore. The statue of Virgin Mary outside a church was damaged as some people pelted stones.
Bajrang Dal's involvement.
Mahendra Kumar, the state convener for the Bajrang Dal group, claimed responsibility for the attacks. He was arrested on 20 September, after the state government was sternly admonished by the Central Government.
The Bajrang Dal group claims that Hindus are being illegally converted to Christianity in the area. They claim that the Christian missionaries are running a large scale conversion program with a long term plan to divide India on the basis of religion. The ban on catholic church in China is quoted as an example of the intentions of the church. However, the recent anti-Christian violence in Karnataka and Orissa have led to calls for a ban on Bajrang Dal.
Government faces criticism.
B.S. Yeddyurappa, the Chief Minister of Karnataka, said the attacks were provoked by conversions of Hindus to Christianity. He also alleged that a Protestant group had distributed literature which insulted Hindu gods. The Chief Minister however clarified that he was not defending the actions of those who attacked prayer halls and churches in Mangalore, Udupi and Chikmagalur on Sunday. Later, the Christian leaders denied it and commented that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was inciting violence rather than working to calm the situation. On the other hand, the Central Government had strongly criticized and sent showcase notices to the state Government for not solving the issue effectively.
According to National Commission for Minorities that the Karnataka government of serious lapses in handling the situation and they found directly responsible for allowing violence to spread, and said the police failed to solve the issue effectively as the violence continues. They also clarified that there were no reported complaints of forced conversion registered in the state.
On 18 September, the Congress led Central Government issued an advisory under "Article 355" of the constitution to the Orissa and Karnataka governments. Directives issued under Article 355, if unheeded, become a prelude to invoking President's Rule. The next day, the centre issued a separate and sterner advisory to Karnataka demanding urgent steps to restore peace. However, the Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa blamed lapses on the part of the police for these attacks, and directed the home minister and DGP to act against jurisdictional police officers.
A high-level official team headed by Union special secretary (internal security) M L Kumawat was rushed to Mangalore and other affected places in the state. Senior Congress Party leaders Veerappa Moily, Margaret Alva and Janardhana Poojary also visited the state.
On 22 September, the Archbishop of Bangalore has spoken his reaction regarding the issue to the Chief Minister B. S. Yeddyurappa.

Godovikovite

Godovikovite is a rare sulfate mineral with the chemical formula: (NH4)Al(SO4)2. Aluminium can partially be substituted by iron. Hydration of godovikovite gives the ammonium alum, tschermigite. The mineral forms cryptocrystalline, often porous, masses, usually of white colour. Single crystals are very small hexagonal blades. Typical environment for godovikovite are burning coal sites (mainly dumps). There the mineral acts, together with millosevichite, as one of the main components of so-called sulfate crust.
It was first described in 1988 for an occurrence in the Chelyabinsk coal basin, Chelyabinsk Oblast, Southern Urals, Russia, and named for Russian mineralogist Aleksandrovich Godovikov (1927–1995).

Carrera Autopodistica

The Carrera Autopodistica is a human-powered land vehicle racing competition that takes place in Castel San Pietro Terme near Bologna, Italy, every September. The vehicles involved are unique, velomobile-like cars guided by a pilot and propelled by "spingitori", or pushing men.
History.
It is the central happening of Settembre Castellano, a series of cultural, sports and gastronomic events, which have their climax every year on the second Sunday of September with the Sagra Castellana della Braciola (the sheep chop fair), that in 2001 saw its 50th edition. Even the Carrera Autopodistica saw its 50th edition in 2003.
Over the last half-century the Carrera Autopodistica has increasingly evolved, following the evolution of technology and exploiting the innovations of technical and sports fields much as possible, in order to improve its performances.
The teams work for a whole year to build more and more sophisticated cars, which can guarantee smoothness on downhill roads and on flat ground, but also lightness to the athletes who take turns in pushing the cars.
Races.
There are two competitions on a single day. The Coppa Terme, on a distance of 1.600 metres, has its starting line at the beginning of Viale delle Terme and its finish line at the entrance of the spa building.
The Carrera Autopodistica, the main event, takes place in the heart of the historical city centre of the town, with the starting and finish lines in Piazza XX Settembre: the distance covered is 1.250 metres long and it is repeated twice.
Rules.
Four pushing men ("spingitori") and a pilot driving the car take part in both competitions.
The pushing men take turns in pushing the car and the car becomes the witness of this very original relay race. The competition rules allow only one pushing man at a time and on downhill roads ("la bassa"), where the car runs faster than its pusher, the pusher gets in the car behind the driver. Then, he goes on pushing when the car speed reduces.
Programme.
Every year the programme includes: the time trials on the first Sunday of September, in order to decide the starting grid.
On the second Sunday of September the races take place: Coppa Terme and Carrera Autopodistica.

Sulfate crust

Sulfate crust is a zone observed in the axial (central) parts of burning coal dumps and related sites. It is a zone built mainly by anhydrous sulfate minerals, such as godovikovite and millosevichite. The outer zone can easily be hydrated giving rise to minerals like tschermigite and alunogen. The zone forms due to interaction with hot (even around 600 °C) coal-derived gases (mainly NH3 and SO3) with the "sterile" material (i.e. shales and other rocks serving as the source of Al3+, Fe3+, Ca2+ and other cations) in case of the lack of vents for the gases to escape into the atmosphere.

Hurling was by far the stronger of the two codes until the 1920s. However, since then Gaelic football has taken pride of place and hurling is no longer played in the club. The club was founded in 1933 but did not affiliate to the GAA until 1938.
History.

<doc id="19387846" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19387846" title="Vocal harmony">
Vocal harmony

Vocal harmony is a style of vocal music in which a consonant note or notes are sung at the same time as a main melody in a predominantly homophonic texture. Vocal harmonies are used in many subgenres of European art music, including Classical choral music and opera and in the popular styles from many Western cultures ranging from folk songs and musical theater pieces to rock ballads. In the simplest style of vocal harmony, the main vocal melody is supported by a single backup vocal line, either at a pitch which is above or below the main vocal line, often in thirds or sixths which fit in with the chord progression used in the song. In more complex vocal harmony arrangements, different backup singers may sing two or even three other notes at the same time as each of the main melody notes, mostly with consonant, pleasing-sounding thirds, sixths, and fifths (although dissonant notes may be used as short passing notes).
In art music.
Vocal harmonies have been an important part of Western art music since the Renaissance-era introduction of Mass melodies harmonized in sweet thirds and sixths. With the rise of the Lutheran church's chorale hymn singing style, congregations sang hymns arranged with four or five-part vocal harmony. In the Romantic era of music during the 1800s, vocal harmonization became more complex, and arrangers began including more dissonant harmonies. Operas and choral music from the Romantic era used tense-sounding vocal harmonies with augmented and diminished intervals as an important tool for underscoring the drama of the music. With contemporary music from the 1900s and 2000s, composers made increasingly difficult demands on choirs which were singing in vocal harmony, such as instructions to sing microtonal notes or make percussive sounds.
In popular music.
To sing vocal harmony in a pop or rock context, backup singers need to be able to adjust the pitch of their notes so that they are in tune with the pitch of the lead vocalist and the band's instruments. As well, the rhythm of the backup harmony parts has to be in time with the lead singer and the rhythm section. While some bands use relatively simple harmony vocals, with long, slow-moving vocal harmony notes supporting the vocal lead during the chorus sections, other bands make the backup singers into more equal partners of the main vocalist. In more vocally-oriented bands, backup singers may have to sing complex parts which demand a vocal agility and sensitivity equal to that of the main vocal line. Usually, pop and rock bands use harmony vocals while the rest of the band is playing; however, as an effect, some rock and pop harmony vocals are done a cappella, without instrumental accompaniment. This device became widely used in the end chorus section of 1980s and 1990s-era hard rock and heavy metal ballads as well as horror punk (which cites influence from both heavy metal and doo-wop)
Other roles.
While some bands use backup singers who only sing when they are on stage, it is common for backup singers to have other roles while they are on stage. In many rock and metal bands, the musicians doing backup vocals also play instruments, such as keyboards, rhythm guitar or drums. In Latin or Afro-Cuban groups, backup singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and hip-hop groups and in musical theater, the backup singers may be required to perform elaborately-choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.
Barbershop quartets.
One of the more complex styles of vocal harmony is the barbershop quartet style, in which the melody is harmonized in four parts. In a barbershop quartet arrangement, each voice has its own role: generally, the lead sings the melody, the tenor harmonizes above the melody, the bass sings the lowest harmonizing notes, and the baritone completes the chord, usually below the lead. The melody is not usually sung by the tenor or bass. Barbershop quartets are more likely to use dissonant and "tense"-sounding dominant seventh chords than pop or rock bands.
Doo-wop groups.
Doo-wop is a style of vocal-based rhythm and blues music, which developed in African-American communities in the 1940s and which achieved mainstream popularity in the US both in the 1950s to the early 1960s. It used smooth, consonant vocal harmonies, with a number of singers imitating instruments while singing nonsense syllables. For example, in The Ravens' song "Count Every Star" (1950), the singers imitate the "doomph", "doomph" plucking-sound of a double bass. Well-known hits include "In the Still of the Night (I Remember)" and "Get a Job" by The Silhouettes, a hit in 1958. Doo-wop remained popular until just before the British Invasion of 1964.

Postage stamps and postal history of Tibet

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Tibet.
Foreign stamps.
The first adhesive stamps issued for use in Tibet were typewritten overprints on Indian postage stamps through the 1903 period, during which the Tibetan Frontier Commission, led by Sir Francis Younghusband, arrived in Khamba Jong on July 7, 1903. Soon after, as no progress was made in diplomatically settling issues of the Tibetan border with Sikkim, this became a military expedition. One result of the treaty signed September 7, 1904 was the establishment of Indian Postal Agencies at Gartok, in Western Tibet, and Gyantse, Pharijong and Yatung, along the Indian trade route to Lhasa. Chinese forces occupied Tibet in 1909, when the Dalai Lama fled into Sikkim and India. However, there were Chinese communities in Tibet well before this, as shown by a registered letter from Wen Tsung-yao at Lhasa, January 9, 1909. Thereafter, Chinese stamps and special Chinese date stamps were used at Chabdo, Gyantse, Lhasa, Pharijong, Shigatse and Yatung. Postal communications of this period are scarce and eagerly sought after by both Chinese and Tibetan specialists.
First stamps of Tibet.
Tibet began issuing postage stamps at the beginning of the 20th century. The first stamps were issued in Lhasa in 1912. Other series of stamps were issued in 1914, 1933, and through the end of the 1950s.
Tibetan stamps had a figure of a snowlion, the national emblem of Tibet. The stamps were marked in Tibetan characters meaning "Tibet Government" and in English by "Tibet".
Fakes and forgeries.
Collectors and philatelists encounter many fakes and forgeries of both Tibetan stamps and cancellations. Genuine postally used material also has been produced for collectors.

Kärkna Abbey

Kärkna Abbey (; or "Valkenau"), now ruined, was a former Cistercian monastery in Estonia.
Situation.
The monastery was sited about 8 km north of Tartu (formerly Dorpat) in the village of Lammiku near the point where the Amme River flows into the Emajõgi River.
History.
The monastery was founded before 1233 by the Bishop of Dorpat, Hermann von Buxhoeveden, and settled by monks from Pforta Abbey, of the filiation of Morimond. An early destruction by heathen inhabitants of the district is mentioned in 1234. After attacks by Russian forces from the principality of Vladimir-Suzdal and the Novgorod Republic it was rebuilt in about 1240 as a fortress surrounded by a moat and a rectangular granite wall. In 1305 it was placed under Stolpe Abbey on the Peene in Pomerania, which had joined the Cistercian order the previous year. In August 1558 the monastery was destroyed at the beginning of the Livonian War. There are remains of the foundations and of the perimeter walls.
Buildings.
The rectangular church was about 47 metres long, and consisted of a single nave of five vaulted bays. Unusually for a Cistercian church it also had a crypt of 10 bays containing two aisles, which was used not only as a place of burial but also as a place of shelter during hostilities. To the south of the church were attached the conventual buildings in the usual form of three ranges arranged in a square round a cloister and a central courtyard, with the chapter house in the east range.

Rouge River Bridge is a series of spans carrying traffic on Highway 401 (Ontario) over the Rouge River (Ontario).
It is technically not a single bridge, but rather several spans of highway overpasses over the Rouge River. Parts of the original bridges (built 1941-1942) during the initial construction of Highway 401 remain next to the spans added after the 1970s.
The inner or express spans were built in 1974 and the outer or collector spans were completed in 1994 as part of the widening of the highway between Pickering and Scarborough. Both spans are Girder bridges. The spans carry 12 lanes of traffic in total, and run parallel to a section of Kingston Road that spans across the Rouge River on the north side.

Padise Abbey

Padise Abbey () was a former Cistercian monastery in Padise in Harju County, Estonia, settled in 1310 by the dispossessed monks of Dünamünde Abbey in Latvia. It was converted into a fortress after its dissolution in 1559 and later used as a country house until 1766. The ruins now house a museum.
History.
The interest in Padise of monks from Dünamünde Abbey in the present Daugavgrīva near Riga is first documented in 1283 in a letter from King Eric V of Denmark (Eric Klipping) regarding the acquisition of land for the construction of a Cistercian monastery, but almost certainly they had had a presence there for several decades previously as a part of the Christianisation of the territories of Estonia newly-conquered by the Teutonic Knights. In 1305 Dünamünde Abbey was appropriated by the Teutonic Knights and the monks dispossessed. King Eric VI of Denmark then gave them permission to build a fortified monastery in Padise, where they moved in 1310, although construction of the stone buildings did not begin until 1317. The new monastery was made subordinate to Stolpe Abbey in Pomerania in 1319.
By 1343, at the time of the St. George's Night Uprising, when it was still only partly built, the monastery was burnt down and 28 monks, lay brothers and German vassals were killed. Rebuilding began only after 1370. By 1445 all major works, including the construction of the gatehouse and the residential and service buildings, had been completed, and vaulting had been added to the church roof. The consecration of the main building took place in 1448.
By about 1400 the monastery had acquired extensive estates in Estonia and also in southern Finland and throughout the 15th century enjoyed a period of great prosperity and influence as one of the most important spiritual centres of Estonia. From about 1500 however it began to sell off its lands and entered a period of decline. Nevertheless it survived the upheavals of the Reformation in the 1520s.
However, in the Livonian War, the last Master of the Livonian Order, Gotthard Kettler, fearing after the invasion of the Russians that the Swedes would occupy the monastery, occupied it himself in 1558, and in 1559 dissolved it, ejecting the monks and confiscating the buildings and estates. He converted the monastery itself into a fortress, which the Swedes duly took in 1561. In 1576 the Russians besieged and took it, and during their occupation strengthened the fortifications, but four years later were in their turn besieged by the returning Swedes, who regained it in 1580 after a long siege and a damaging bombardment.
In 1622 King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden gave the estates of the former Padise Abbey to Thomas Ramm, Burgermeister of Riga, in the possession of whose family it remained until 1919. Ramm converted the premises into a Baroque country house. When in 1766 it was struck by lightning and burnt down, the Ramms used the stone to build a Neo-Classical manor house nearby.
Present-day use.

Ganagapura

Ganagapura (Kannada ಗಾಣಗಾಪುರ, sometimes called Deval Ganagapur) is a village in Karnataka, India. It is located in the Afzalpur taluk of Gulbarga district in Karnataka.
The village is noted for its temple to Dattatreya, who is said to have attained realization here on the banks of the river Bhima.
Demographics.
In India's 2001 census, Ganagapura had a population of 6491, with 3250 males and 3241 females.
Religious Significance.
Ganagapura is a "kshetra" (place of pilgrimage) associated with Sri Narasimha Saraswati Swami, the second incarnation of Dattatreya. According to the book "Shri GuruCharitra", he promised that he would abide forever at Ganagapura. In the morning, he would bathe at the confluence of the Bhima and Amarja rivers. At midday, he would go through the village asking for "bhiksha" (alms of food), and accept "pooja" offerings in the form of "paduka" (sandals) at the temple. Devotees believe that by bathing at the confluence, by begging ("maadhukari") at at least five houses in Ganagapura, and by offering "paduka" at the temple, they can experience the living presence ("darśana") of Sri Narasimha Saraswati Swami, and be freed from sins and granted wishes.
Places of Interest.
Significant places include:
The Nirguna Math is adorned with the Nirguna Padukas. 
Sangam Kshetra
Sangam Kshetra is a meeting point of Bhima and Amarja rivers. The water of these rivers, especially at their confluence, called Sangam, are considered extremely holy. Those who bathe in Sangam will be freed from their sins, and their wishes will be fulfilled. There is a temple in Sangam in which the Shree Narasimha Saraswati Swamy performed the Anusthana. The `Shella Padukas' of Swamy are here.
Audumbar Tree
The Audumbar tree is situated near Sangam. Many devotees do the "Shree Gurucharitra parayana" (reading of "Shree Gurucharitra") there.
History of Audumbar tree at Sangam Kshetra
A person named Narahari was cured of leprosy by Shree Guru Narasimha Saraswati Swamy. Narahari bowed to Shreeguru and began to pray him at that time. The 8 sloka stotra composed by Narahari became famous, and are recited in the temple at night to this day. Each sloka ends with “Vandayaami Naarasimha Saraswatheesha Paahimaam”. The stotra is now familiar as Narasimha Saraswati Ashtaka. Shreeguru blessed Narahari, and said that whoever recites the sloka every day with full devotion will get ashta aishwarya, spiritual power, wealth, fame and noble offspring.
Ash Hill
Ash hill is nearer to Sangam and it is said that there was a hill from which Ash came from the days of Lord Parashurama. Lord Parashurama performed penance at this place. The ash is very powerful and now it is in the form of Mud only. The wearing of ash by mixing with oodi is very powerful and it will protect those persons from drishti doshas. It will protect the children for Baalarishta and Graha dosha. If the ash is applied slightly every day on the stomach part of pregnant women, then they will deliver a healthy child with some "Tejarupa".
Shree Kalleshwar
This is the temple of Sri Kalleshwar (Shiva) which is quite famous in Ganagapur. It is said that the poet Narahari, who used to pray Kalleshwar, once started seeing Sri Narasimha Saraswati in Kalleshwara's place. He became a devotee of Sri Narasimha Saraswati. This temple is considered as equivalent to Gokarna. In this temple, the Swayambhu Shani and many temples are situated.
Ashta Teerthas
Below are the names of Ashta theerthas:
The importance of taking bath in these Ashta teerthas can be known from Shree Gurucharitra. Some devotees take a bath every day during their stay in Ganagapur and some bathe at least once during their yatra period. Bathing in Ashta teerthas on Naraka Chathurdashi (eve of Diwali) day is considered very powerful. Sins and doshas are believed to be removed by bathing in these Ashta teerthas.
Lord Dattatreya’s incarnations.
Sripaad Shree Vallabh was born in a Brahmin family in a village named Pithapuram (East Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh, India) and disappeared in Kurvapur.
Narasimha Saraswati (1378−1458) is the Purna avatar of Dattatreya. (As per the Shreepad Shreevallabha Charitra he is second avatar of Dattatreya). He was born in Karanjapur which is modern Lad-Karanja or karanja in Maharashtra Vidharbha region. He was initially named Narahari or Shaligramadeva. His father's name was Madhav and mother's name was Amba-Bhavani. His surname was Kale. He was born in a Deshastha Brahmin family, Shulka-yajurvedi Brahman Kanva Shaka, at Karanja.

Basic Strategic Arts Program

The Basic Strategic Art Program (BSAP) is a specialized academic program taught at the U.S. Army War College. In the late 1990s when the Army created Functional Area 59, the United States Army War College chosen as the institution to host the program. The first BSAP class was in 2003. FA 59 Officers were used in combat for the first time beginning in 2001 with the onset of the Global War on Terror. Graduates of this program have served in key positions in Iraq, Afghanistan, at all combatant commands, Army Service Component Commands, and at the Pentagon. The program is the qualification course for Officers selected for FA59 (Strategist, formerly Strategic Plans & Policy). It provides an introduction to strategy, art and practice, and establishes a base of the unique skills, knowledge, and attributes required for an Officer's development as a strategist. The course is taught to rigorous academic standards, failure to achieve and maintain these standards is cause for disenrollment from the program and loss of the Functional Area identifier.
Faculty.
The course is directed by an FA59 Lieutenant Colonel and employs two full-time instructors serve as educators and mentors with a civilian technician providing administrative support. The Director of BSAP is responsible for the execution of the program, and is the primary liaison to the Proponent Office at Headquarters, Department of the Army in Washington, DC. The two civilian instructors develop and implement the curriculum, along with the program Director, and an educational technician provides administrative and program support. BSAP draws upon the entire faculty of the War College to support instruction. In addition, the BSAP curriculum makes full use of additional academic and professional opportunities available during the resident and non-resident courses at the U.S. Army War College. BSAP students will sit in seminar with many of the same renowned subject matter experts who lecture for the Advanced Strategic Art Program, the U.S. Army War College resident program and the other Senior Service Colleges.
Curriculum.
The BSAP curriculum is based on six modules of study that provide the officers with the unique skills, knowledge, and attributes needed as a foundation for their progressive development as Army strategists.
Strategic theory.
This module provides a foundation in strategic and operational theory. This course of study provides the officer with the theoretical tools to enable him or her to evaluate doctrine and strategy. It begins with a survey of classical strategic theory from Sun Tzu to Clausewitz. Next the course examines modern strategic theory, including modern theories that underpin current service and joint doctrine. The module also looks at the notion of strategic culture and ends with a discussion of current operational theory and the role of theory and doctrine in practice.
Strategic art.
In this module students study the practice of the strategic art from the Peloponnesian Wars to the Global War on Terrorism. Students will discuss critical themes, which help explain victory or defeat. Among these themes are: strategy and policy match, theories of victory, mirror imaging, civil-military relations, pre-war plans and wartime realities, and coalition warfare.
Army systems.
This module will familiarize students with how the nation raises and maintains the Army. Specifically, students will develop an appreciation for Army resource and force management, readiness, and transformation.
National security and decision-making.
This module will acquaint students with the nature of decision-making on national security matters in the executive branch of the U.S. Government. This module includes an examination of the national security organization and policy development. It covers the theory and reality of the interagency process and an analysis of the main agencies engaged in national security. The students will look at real world case studies which will illustrate both the formal and informal processes at work. This module will also include a trip to Washington, D.C. to visit the State Department, the NSC, JCS, CIA, and the Army G-3.
Contemporary strategic challenges.
This module uses assigned readings, guest lecturers and a program of study to familiarize students with the strategic environment for Northeast Asia, Southwest Asia, Western Hemisphere, and Europe. The course examines U.S. regional interest, objectives, trends, and factors which impact on them. The module concludes with an examination of the homeland security.
Landpower.
This module familiarizes students with the strategic value of landpower and the strategic role of the U.S. Army. Key to this module is the study of campaign planning. Students learn about the structure and employment of Army forces in theater. At the conclusion of this module, students should be able to articulate appropriate Army roles and Army Forces (ARFOR), Joint Forces Land Component (JFLC), and Army theater planning for a given strategy.
Staff rides and staff visits.
BSAP students participate in two staff rides and one staff visit. The interagency staff ride that concludes the National Security Decision-Making module includes visits to the State Department, NSC, OSD, JCS, the Army staff, and other relevant entities in Washington, DC. BSAP concludes with a staff ride of Grant's 1864 Overland Campaign. This staff ride serves as review for the entire course and as a vehicle for additional insights as the students look at the operational, theater strategic, and strategic insights from the Battle of the Wilderness to Appomattox Court House.
