Bobbie

Bobbie was the name of a British regimental mascot dog, a mongrel from Reading, who accompanied his regiment to Afghanistan and became involved in the disaster of Maiwand. He survived and upon his return to England was presented to Queen Victoria.
Life.
Bobbie belonged to Lance-Sergeant Peter Kelly of the 66th Regiment of Foot (the Berkshire Regiment). He was initially stationed at Brock Barracks, and went overseas with the regiment in the late 1870s.
In 1880 the regiment was stationed at the fort in Kandahar, Afghanistan, which had been occupied by the British since January 1879, just after the start of the Second Anglo-Afghan War.
On 3 July 1880 a column of some 2,700 troops under Brigadier George Burrows set out from Kandahar to assist friendly tribesmen in putting down a rebellion by Ayub Khan. Bobbie accompanied the troops. For ten days Burrows searched for the rebel force. Meanwhile, the friendly tribesmen turned out not to be so friendly, leaving Burrows' force to face an ever-increasing rebel army in countryside where every man's hand was ready to turn against them.
Eventually the British force was surrounded and attacked by the much larger Afghan force. Along with a line of Indian regiments and cavalry, the 66th Foot made a determined stand while the guns were evacuated, Bobbie barking furiously at the attackers. The British were overrun, over half of the 66th regiment being wiped out, while the survivors had no option but to get back as best they could to Kandahar. In the confusion Bobbie got lost, but the following day, survivors making their way back to the fort spotted him trying to catch up, though he was wounded. He was re-united with his owner, who was also on the wounded list.
Upon arrival back in England Bobbie was presented to Queen Victoria along with several soldiers of the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment who received their Distinguished Conduct Orders.
Unfortunately, a year later, Bobbie was accidentally run over and killed by a hansom cab in Gosport. He was stuffed and can be seen today at the regimental museum in Salisbury, decorated with an unknown soldier's Afghan War medal.

1979 Chatham Cup

The 1979 Chatham Cup was the 52nd annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
Early stages of the competition were run in three regions (northern, central, and southern), with the National League teams receiving a bye until the Fourth Roundof the competition. In all, 131 teams took part in the competition. Note: Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article.
The 1979 final.
The final was the second all-Auckland final clash, the first having been between the same teams (but with a different winner) in 1973. North Shore's Adrian Elrick and Keith Hobbs appeared in both finals (the latter as a substitute in the first match), as did Mount Wellington's Tony Sibley and Bill de Graaf. North Shore won the final for a then-record equalling fifth time. The final was the first of five in a row to feature Mount Wellington.
The final has been described as "the one that slipped away", as the expected venue, Newmarket Park, was made unavailable after a small landslide destroyed much of the playing area. McLennan Park in Papakura stepped in as a replacement. Mount Wellington would have gone into the match as clear favourites, but the sending off of play-maker Brian Turner in the previous match rendered him suspended from the final,l evening the two sides up considerably.
In the first half goals were traded, with the Mount's John Leijh opening the scoring only for Keith Hobbs to level the score for North Shore. Early in the second spell Mount Wellington's Stewart Carruthers was sent off, tipping the scales towards the North Shore side. The Mount were entrenched deep in their own half for much of the remainder of the match but Iain Ormond was brought down in the box and slotted the ball home from the resulting penalty to take the cup over the Waitemata.

Zoo Sauvage de St-Félicien

The Zoo Sauvage de St-Félicien (English:Wild Zoo of St-Félicien) is one of the largest zoos in the province of Quebec. Located in Saint-Félicien, the Zoo is dedicated to wildlife conservation of the boreal climate and is managed by "The Centre for Conservation of Boreal Biodiversity inc."
The Zoo Sauvage de St-Félicien is an accredited member of the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA).
History.
The zoo was founded in 1960 through the initiative of Ghislain Gagnon and six others who opened it on an abandoned fox farm lent to them by Haldaige Laflamme. The zoo was set up as a traditional zoo that showcased exotic and North American animals.
On January 4, 1961, the Fondation de la Société zoologique de St-Félicien inc (English: St-Félicien Zoological Society Foundation inc.) was registered as a non-profit society. One month later the foundation purchased Île-aux-Bernard and of land from Paul E. Gagnon for $12,000, no interest, and payments of only $500 per year.
By 1968 the zoo owned more than , and was home to 450 animals of 91 species. By this time, the zoo also included a restaurant, a kitchen, and a souvenir shop. Additional land was purchased in 1969, bringing the zoos holdings up to . Ghislain Gagnon began wondering if there was a better way to keep animals other than in cages, which resulted in the zoo being completely rethought.
The zoo opened its Nature Park Trails on September 10, 1972. The "new zoo" covered about and included a screened-in "train" with about of roadway, from which visitors could observe animals that are native to Quebec, freeing the animals to larger enclosures and putting the visitors in the cages. An additional of land was purchased in 1974, and work began on expanding the Nature Park Trails. The expansion of the Nature Park Trails officially opened in 1978, with a new lake (Lac Montagnais) having been dug and Mount Keewatinook erected. There were now of roadway in the Nature Park Trails, as well as reproductions of historic sites including the Colonist Farm, the Lumberjack Camp, the Trading Post, the Indian Campground, the Grand Trestle, and the Western Ranch.
In the early eighties, the zoo was financially strong and received over 300,000 visitors to its park. It became obvious through visitor comments that the demand for more educational focus at the zoo was growing, and the zoo came up with a Zoo of the Year 2000 plan, and the St-Félicien Zoological Society Foundation (French: Fondation de la Société zoologique de St-Félicien) was created in 1981 to help implement such a transformation. In 1985, work began to create habitats adapted to each animals way of life and to remove the animals from their cages. In order to house carnivores such as their big cats, three large paddocks were built. In addition, the chimpanzee habitat was constructed so the animals were contained only by a fence surrounding the water basin, in order to keep people out. The zoo also constructed new homes for giraffes, elephants, and hippotamus with walls and ditches replacing cages to separate visitors from the large animals.
In 1986, a work conflict caused a zoo lockout for three months and threatened to close the zoo. A re-launching committee was formed by Benoit Laprise, the mayor of St-Félicien, and in early 1987 was able to raise $1,300,000 to save the zoo from closure. The committee received help from numerous employees, citizens, municipalities, corporations, and governments. That same year, the zoo made organizational changes both at the employee and administrative levels, and the St-Félicien Zoological Society Foundation created their new mission statement with a focus on education, research, natural, and cultural patrimony, which was part of the Zoo of the Year 2000 plan. In the next two years, the zoo won many regional awards and changed its name to the Zoo Sauvage de St-Félicien in 1989, to reflect its new focus.
In the 1990s, the Wild Zoo won first prize in the Quebec Tourism Regional Awards and was awarded the National Grand Prize under the category ‘Touristic Promotion,’ although, the Wild Zoo would go through numerous changes during the early nineties. Ghislan Gagnon, the zoo's original founder retired on December 31, 1992, leaving Martin Laforge to manage the zoo. In September 1993 the Wild Zoo solved its problem with wastewater discharging into the rivière-aux-saumons. The Wild Zoo would use artificial swamps to treat the wastewater that came from the zoo and the campground before it entered into the rivière-aux-saumons. This ecological project was one of the first steps in sustainable development of the zoo. In order to finance the project, the zoo received subsidies, but needed to sell the campground to cover its portion of the cost. 
During the same year, a committee was created to decide whether or not the Wild Zoo should abandon its exotic animal collection. The idea to make the decision came from considerations that the Wild Zoo needed its own niche to attract clients believing that visitors seeing exotic animals in other institutions needed to have an interest to come back to the Wild Zoo for its unique and specific style. Lastly, the Wild Zoo committee also believed that they were contradicting themselves between the traditional/exotic zoo (animals in cages) and the Nature Park Trails where free indigenous fauna roamed free.
The committee decided that only a huge investment would be used to restructure the traditional part of the Wild Zoo and insure its survival, as well, to make it stand out from other zoos. Through this conclusion the committee decided to remove its exotic animal collection in 1993, and shifted its focus towards animals that live in Nordic environments. Through this decision, the Wild Zoo's finances were healthier due to the loss of exotic animal species that were more costly to maintain due to their nature and different environments they are accustomed to.
In the following years, major renovations began that included the Île-aux-Bernard (1995), the Valley Sector (1996), and the new polar bear habitat (1997), while new constructions such as the Great Aviary, the Kids Garden, the Ghislan Gagnon Interpretation Centre were being added. Buildings that were no longer needed were turned into veterinary clinics in order to meet Quebec government and Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) standards. Through these changes, the Wild Zoo animal cohabitation was no longer restricted to the Nature Park Trails and visitors could see animals roaming freely everywhere on the site when the Wild Zoo reopened its doors in the 1997 winter season, being accessible for all four seasons, which for most Canadian zoos is impossible to do. Through these changes and innovations the Wild Zoo led the way as being a model for other Zoological Parks in Quebec and followed through with Gagnon's original vision.
In May 2001, the Wild Zoo decided to broaden its mission statement by modifying its focus again and became the Centre for Conservation of Boreal Biodiversity (French: La Fondation du Centre de conservation de la biodiversité boréale (CCBB)).
The new CCBB wanted to increase the benefits of its organization on a local, regional and international level by following the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity that was adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Through this change and model, the Wild Zoo shifted its efforts from Nordic towards protecting the biodiversity of the boreal forests through preservation, education, and research.
Shortly, Phase I of the plan commenced with the construction of the Borealium, which is a Visitors' Centre, in addition, to being a research, documenation, and education facility. In recent years, the Wild Zoo built new exhibits and eventually re-introduced exotic animal species to its collection that lived in the boreal environments of Asia. In 2010, the Wild Zoo introduced exotic species that live in the boreal environments of Mongolia through the remodeling of an island and opened the Mongolian habitat. At the same time, a family area with water games, and a small farm was also built.
On December 4, 2009, the Zoo Sauvage de St-Félicien female Polar Bear, Aisaqvaq gave birth to two polar bear cubs, which is the first time that a Canadian zoo experienced the birth of twin polar bears. The polar bear cubs at first were only viewed from a hidden camera inside the den and eventually at three months of age wandered outside with their mom away from public viewing. When the cubs were six months old, they made their first public appearance at the Wild Zoo in June 2010.

Arduinici

The Arduinici were a noble Frankish family that immigrated to Italy in the early tenth century, possibly from Neustria. They were descended from and take their name after one Arduin (Harduoin). 
The first of the Arduinici to enter Italy was Roger, son of Arduin, who was established as count ("comes") at Auriate in the early tenth century. He extended his power and was succeeded by his son Arduin Glaber, named after his grandfather, who established the family as one of the most powerful in northwestern Italy. He conquered the Susa Valley and allied with Provence against Fraxinetum. He ruled the counties of Auriate, Turin, Asti, Albenga and probably Bredulo, Alba, and Ventimiglia. During a reorganisation of the structure of Italy's marches under Berengar II in 950, Arduin's territories were organised as the March of Turin, or "marca Arduinica". 
Arduin allied his family with the House of Canossa by marrying his heir, Manfred I to Prangarda, daughter of Adalbert Atto of Canossa. The family later drew itself close to the Holy Roman Empire. Arduin's grandson, Ulric Manfred (Odalrich-Maginfred), was one of the most powerful noblemen Italy in the 1020s, when he tried to play kingmaker and give the throne to William V of Aquitaine. Ulric Manfred's daughters, Adelaide and Irmgard, married high-ranking German princes: Hermann IV of Swabia and Otto III of Swabia, respectively. Irmgard later married Egbert I, Margrave of Meissen, one of the richest magnates in Germany, and Adelaide, through her marriage to Otto of Savoy, was the mother of Bertha, empress of Henry IV and of another Adelaide, who married the German anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfeld. Adelaide (died 1091) was the last scion of the house; her heirs were her sons Peter I and Amadeus II of Savoy. The Arduinici possessions in Italy formed the basis for Savoy power there and of the later Duchy of Savoy, Kingdom of Sardinia and Kingdom of Italy.

Emmeline Lott

Emmeline Lott was the author of "The English Governess in Egypt: Harem Life in Egypt and Constantinople" (1867) an account of her employment as governess to the young son of Isma'il Pasha, Viceroy of Egypt. Lott believed that her position as a "humble individual" and member of the household provided her with a more authentic perspective than that of aristocratic visitors such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, for whom the harem was tidied up for public viewing. Lott's tone towards Egyptian women is often contemptuous - she claims that far from being Oriental beauties of European fantasy, they are "hideous and hag-like". Lott believed herself to be superior to Egyptians by virtue of her race; it was a shock to find that as a governess, she was treated as a servant and a social inferior.

Roni Bowers

Veronica "Roni" Bowers (Born July 17, 1965 died April 20, 2001) was an American Christian missionary who became known as a victim of the War on Drugs.
While flying into Peru, Bowers, her infant daughter Charity, husband Jim, and six-year-old son Cory were being followed by a United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) observation plane which contacted the Peruvian Air Force to shoot the civilian plane down, believing that they were carrying drugs out of the country. The Peruvian Air Force was operating as part of the Air Bridge Denial Program. The CIA did not attempt to identify the tail number of church-owned plane per procedure.
Events leading to death.
In a video released by the CIA, the CIA observers can be heard discussing whether the plane is a "bandito" (drug plane) or "amigo" (friendly). A CIA officer then tells a Peruvian Air Force official that it may be possible to have the plane land to check. The Peruvian Air Force plane then issues a warning to the plane for not having an authorized flight plan, but the pilot did not hear it because he was on a different frequency. As the Peruvian Air Force plane prepared to open fire, a CIA officer can be heard saying that the plane "doesn't fit the profile", and another CIA official says, "Ok, I understand this is not our call, but this guy is at 4,500 feet and he is not taking any evasive action. I recommend we follow him. I do not recommend phase 3 the plane down at this time."
Later, a Peruvian official asks if "phase 3" is authorized, and the CIA official replies asking if he is "sure it's a bandito". The Peruvian official replies in the affirmative, and the CIA officer says, "If you're sure." The CIA pilot then says, "This is bullshit" and "I think we're making a mistake." The second CIA officer says, "I agree with you." A Peruvian Air Force plane approached, at which point the pilot of the Bowers' plane makes contact with the Iquitos Control Tower, noting that the Peruvian Air Force has showed up, and he is not sure what they want. 
In the confusion, the CIA plane notes that the pilot Bowers' plane is in contact with the tower, but the Peruvian Air Force had already opened fire. The pilot can be heard yelling, "They're killing me! They're killing us!" The CIA officer says, "Tell them to terminate!" and another officer is heard saying "No! Don't shoot! No mas! more!" At this point, the plane is already on fire, and the CIA observed the plane crash into a river and turn upside down. A CIA officer remarks that if the Peruvian Air Force has a helicopter in the area, they should get it there to rescue them. The CIA plane then observes a boat in the river attempting to rescue the plane's occupants, and one officer says, "Get good video of this." Over the intervening several years since the incident, many had stated that the CIA "ordered" the Peruvian Air Force to shoot down the plane, when this is not the case. 
Bowers and her seven-month-old daughter were killed in the shooting. The pilot, Kevin Donaldson, was shot in the leg but managed to land the plane. Roni's husband and her son were not injured.
Aftermath.
After the event, the US government temporarily suspended the practice of advising foreign governments on shooting down planes over Peru and Colombia. The US Government paid compensation of $8 million to the Bowers family and the pilot. The program was discontinued in 2001. CIA personnel had no authority either to direct or prohibit actions by that government, and CIA officers did not shoot down any airplane. In the Bowers case, CIA personnel protested the identification of the missionary plane as a suspect drug trafficker.
A report by the CIA's inspector general (CIA-OIG) found that the agency had obstructed inquiries into its involvement in the shooting. Peter Hoekstra (the highest ranking Republican on the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence), who published these findings in November 2008, criticized the CIA for the "needless" deaths.

If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.

Kress Drachenflieger

__NOTOC__
The Kress "Drachenflieger" (German: "Dragon-flier") was an experimental aircraft constructed in Austria-Hungary in 1901. While taxiing trials proved successful, the aircraft lacked sufficient power to fly, and was wrecked in the course of testing on 3 October.
It was built by Wilhelm Kress with the assistance of a 5,000-krone grant from Emperor Franz Josef in an attempt to create the first heavier-than-air flying machine. The aircraft was constructed as a large, open-truss structure of steel tubing with three sets of wire-braced monoplane wings placed in tandem along its length. The sets of wings were placed at uneven heights with respect to the major axis of the aircraft to prevent aerodynamic interference between them. The undercarriage consisted of two aluminium pontoons with hardened keels, intended to allow the Drachenflieger to take off from and land on water or ice. Three rudders were linked to a common control stick and were to provide steering on water and in the air. Power was provided by a Daimler petrol engine driving two large auger-style two-bladed propellers, the first attempt to use an internal combustion engine to power a heavier-than-air aircraft. The fabric-covered propellers were mounted pusher-fashion on pylons above and on either side of the main truss, between the second and third sets of wings, and were designed to counter-rotate. 
The engine would prove to be the aircraft's downfall. Kress had originally intended to have an engine specially built, calculating that he needed 37 kW from an engine weighing not more than 220 kg (475 lb). When the cost of this proved prohibitive, he purchased an automobile engine already in production which had an output of just 22 kW (30 hp) but weighing nearly twice as much as Kress' calculations allowed for. Initial trials on water as early as March 1901 confirmed that the poorer power-to-weight ratio would be a problem. Nevertheless, other elements of the design proved sound, and the Drachenflieger was successfully controlled while taxiiing, even against a headwind. 
Unable to afford to replace the engine, Kress continued taxiing trials. The last of these was on 3 October on the Wienerwaldsee reservoir at Tullnerbach, in which he was forced to swerve suddenly to avoid a groyne. As a result of the violent maneuver, the supports for one of the pontoons failed, causing the Drachenflieger to capsize and sink.

Axel Hellstrom

Axel Hellstrom was a muscle reader, mentalist and stage magician. He redefined the art of muscle reading to such an extent that this technique, also known as "contact mind reading" and "Cumberlandism" (after a 19th century practitioner named Stuart Cumberland), is now best known by the name "Hellstromism".
Biography.
Axel Hellstrom lived in Germany and fought in World War I where he watched a man perform an act of muscle reading. At the time, Germany did not allow mind reading unless it had a plausible explanation. The only type of mind reading allowed was muscle reading, and so Axel took advantage of it. He studied it carefully and taught himself everything. He entertained his fellow soldiers and became quite good at this old technique. After the war, he and his wife moved to America where he knew his art form would be accepted by many - especially the magic audiences. Soon he was performing for professional magic audiences and amazed many people. After a short while, mind readers, and even fellow Hellstromists were questioning his ability.
During his live performances, his manager spoke for him because his English vocabulary was limited. Hellstrom would successfully complete many different challenges such as locating hidden items, performing actions that others were thinking of and determining which object someone had selected out of many options. The accuracy of his results was astonishing and he was soon known throughout the United States. He was well-respected by his peers in the stage magic community, and other performers paid hundreds of dollars to learn the secrets behind his technique. He lived a good and profitable life and set the bar high for future Hellstromists.
During the 1930s, the American magician and mentalist Robert A. Nelson published the definitive book on Hellstrom's techniques, with his cooperation. This book, "Hellstromism," has remained an important reference on the subject of muscle reading well into the 21st century. 
Modern practitioners of Hellstromisnm include the magicians Banachek and Kreskin.

Judo at the 2008 Summer Paralympics – Women's 70 kg

The women's 70 kg judo competition at the 2008 Summer Paralympics was held on September 9 at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium. Preliminary rounds started at 12:00 pm CST. Repechage finals, semifinals, bouts for bronze medals, and the final were held at 5:30 pm CST.
This event was the second-heaviest of the women's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 70 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.

<doc id="19295841" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19295841" title="William J. Dickey House">
William J. Dickey House

The William J. Dickey House is located on Imperial Avenue in Cohoes, New York, United States. It was built for Dickey, the superintendent of a local textile mill, in 1890, by an unknown architect.
It is a well-preserved example of local Queen Anne-style residential architecture. In 1998 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
Property.
The house is a frame two-story three-bay home with a cross-gabled roof that comes to a jerkin shape in the front (west) side. A porch wraps around the first story to the south elevation. The south bay on the front side is projecting, with Stick-style decoration between the second-story window and roofline. On the south side is another projecting two-story bay with similarly tall bay window. The north profile features a round-arched stained glass window that illuminates a staircase.
The interior retains much of the original finishing. Most noteworthy among it is the wall plaster, architraves and door surrounds.
In the rear of the property is a small barn with clapboard siding and a gabled roof. It is considered a contributing resource and is now the house's garage.
History.
Imperial Avenue was one of the first streets laid out after Cohoes reincorporated as a city in 1869 and extended the municipal boundary to the west, opening up possibilities for new homes for the city's managerial class. It runs across the top of a sharp rise a mile west of downtown. Dickey's house is at the highest point on the street.
The "Cohoes Daily News" of March 1, 1890, reported on Dickey's move into his new house. He and his wife, having taken up residence a few days previously, received a surprise visit from their friends, who gave them a hanging lamp as a housewarming gift.
Ten years later, in the early 20th century, the stained glass window was put in. There have been no other significant alterations to the house since then. It remains a private residence today.

Olga Lepeshinskaya (dancer)

Olga Vasiliyevna Lepeshinskaya (; – December 20, 2008) was a Soviet ballerina. She was named a People's Artist of the USSR in 1951.
Childhood.
Lepeshinskaya was born to an old Polish noble family in Kiev, Russian Empire (now the capital of Ukraine). Her grandfather, Vasily Pavlovich Lepeshinsky, was arrested as a member of the revolutionary organization Narodnaya Volya. Her father, Vasily Vasilievich Lepeshinsky, was a railway engineer, one of the builders of the Chinese Eastern Railway.
From the early years Lepeshinsky showed her talents in dancing and in the 1925 she was admitted to the Bolshoi Choreographic School. She appeared for the first time on the stage of the Bolshoi Theatre at the age of ten as one of the little birds in the ballet The Daughter of the Snows. In 1932 she played the "Sugar Plum Fairy" in The Nutcracker ballet.
Prima ballerina.
Lepeshinskaya graduated from Bolshoi Choreographic School and started working the Bolshoi Theatre. She started as Rosina in a ballet of The Barber of Seville (Тщетная предосторожность) performed by the second stage of the theater. In 1935 she performed the main role in the "Three fatmen"' ballet by Yury Olesha fairytale. The ballet became very popular and the 18-year old ballerina became famous.
Lepeshinskaya performed in private concerts at the Moscow Kremlin from the age of 17. Lepeshinskaya was very close to Polina Zhemchuzhina, wife of Vyacheslav Molotov. It was a great shock for her when Zhemchuzhina was imprisoned in a Gulag. Lepeshinskaya was known as "the favourite ballerina of Joseph Stalin" and even rumoured to be his mistress. In 1943 she became a member of the Communist Party.
Lepeshinskaya married a Soviet intelligence MGB general Leonid Raykhman (known as the curator of Nikolai Ivanovich Kuznetsov). He was arrested on 19 October 1951 as an alleged participant in the fabricated "Zionist Plot in MGB". Lepeshinskaya claimed that her appeals to Stalin saved the life of her husband. In March 1953, after Stalin death, Leonid Raykhman was freed, rehabilitated and appointed the head of MVD Control Commission. In August 1953 he was arrested again that time for his own fabrications of criminal cases, tortures of prison inmates and other violations of the "Socialist Law". He was sentenced to five years in prison in August 1956 but amnestied in November 1956. Since then he was doing a research work in astronomy.
In February 1940, the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad first performed their Don Quixote ballet with Lepeshinskaya as Kitry. The ballet was a great success. In 1941, when the Stalin Prize was established, Olga Lepeshinskaya was among the first laureates of the prize for her performance in Don Quixote. All together Lepesinskaya received four Stalin Prizes.
With the beginning of the Great Patriotic War Lepeshinskaya became a member of the "Front brigade" of the Bolshoi Theater. The brigade performed near the front lines, in hospitals, in Moscow and in Saratov where the Bolshoi was evacuated. Lepeshinskaya was a member of the brigade until the end of World War II. Her performances near the battlefields were filmed in the 1941 Soviet Documentary "Kontsert - Frontu" (Concerto to the Front).
In 1942, "Soviet youth anti-fascist committee" was organized. Lepeshinskaya was its Deputy chairperson.
In 1943, she starred as Assol in the Bolshoi première Scarlet Sails. On May 9 she was with her Bolshoi brigade with Soviet troops in Warsaw. The next day she received her invitation to perform in the Bolshoi's production of Cinderella. The ballet, first performed on 21 November 1945, was the first post-war show at the Bolshoi. Lepeshinskaya won her second Stalin prize for her performance. She received her third Stalin prize for her performance in the Flames of Paris and the fourth prize for the Tao-Hoa role in The Red Poppy. In 1951 she received the People's Artist of the USSR title along with Galina Ulanova.
Teacher.
She married Soviet General Aleksei Antonov in 1956. In 1962 her husband died. The nervous shock was so strong that she became temporarily blind. When her vision returned, after a year of treatment, she found herself unneeded by the Bolshoi Theater or the Bolshoi School. Fortunately, she found a place at the Komische Oper Berlin where she worked as a ballet mistress for ten years.
After this she worked as a trainer in many different companies throughout the world. For thirty years she served as the Chairperson of Ballet competitions in Moscow. She was the president of the Russian Choreographic Association (since 1992) and was the Chairperson for the Choreography Entrance Exams at the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts (for her last fifty years).
She helped painter Ilya Glazunov during his early career (she was reprimanded for organizing his first exhibition), so he declared Lepeshinskaya to be his godmother in the art.
Lepeshinskaya died of a heart attack on December 20, 2008 in Moscow at the age of 92.

Edward Hearle Rodd

Edward Hearle Rodd (1810–1880), ornithologist, born at the vicarage of St Just in Roseland, Cornwall, on 17 March 1810, was third son of Edward Rodd, D.D. (1768–1842), by his wife Harriet, daughter of Charles Rashleigh, esq., of Duporth, Cornwall.
Life.
He was educated at Ottery St Mary school, and trained for the law, being admitted to practise as a solicitor in Trinity term 1832. Early in the following year he settled at Penzance, where he entered into partnership with George Dennis John. On John's death Rodd was joined by one Drake, and after the latter's death the firm became Rodd & Cornish. Rodd retired about 1878. He had also held many official posts in the town. He was town clerk from 1847, clerk to the local board from 1849, clerk to the Board of Guardians from the passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, and superintendent registrar, besides being head distributor of stamps in Cornwall from 1844 to 1867. He died unmarried at Penzance on 25 Jan. 1880, and was buried in the cemetery there.
Ornithological studies.
Rodd was an ardent ornithologist, and especially interested in the question of migration. He studied minutely at the avifauna of his county, and it was entirely due to his exertion that many a rare bird was rescued from oblivion, while several species were added by him to the list of British birds. He contributed upwards of twenty papers on ornithological matters to the "Zoologist", the "Ibis", and the "Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall" from 1843 onwards.
His collection passed to his nephew, F. R. Rodd, esq., at Trebartha Hall, Launceston.

Flava Works

Flava Works, Inc. headquartered in Miami, Florida, with a satellite office in Chicago, Illinois, is a company that produces gay media featuring black and Latino men.
Overview.
Flava Works was founded in 1999 and is owned and operated by CEO Phillip Bleicher. It began with its “CocoBoyz" website showcasing African-American men in nude and erotic photos and videos. In 2000, Flava Works started “Thugboy” and a year later expanded with the creation of the "CocoDorm." Flava Works moved its operations to Miami, Florida, in 2006 and continues to operate a satellite office in Chicago, Illinois. Flava Works' titles are now available abroad in Europe through a distribution partnership with XY Studios. In January 2009, Flava Works announced its production and distribution partnership with RocaFellaz Entertainment. In April 2009, Flavaworks announced a distribution partnership with Black Rayne Productions. In May 2009, Flava Works signed its first white exclusive model.
Products & services.
Flava Works operates several websites offering pornographic images and videos to its patrons including Cocodorm.com, PapiCock.com, ThugBoy.com, CocoBoyz.com, and FlavaMen.com. Thugsforsex.com is an online dating portal for black and Latin men. It also features a chat room with video chat capabilities to its users. The CocoDorm is a live, interactive residence where models are hired to live together in a dorm-like environment. The "Miami Herald" described the operation as follows: "CocoDorm offers its young, muscular males $1,200 a month along with free room and board while requiring they masturbate and have group sex in front of cameras." Flava Works produces a quarterly magazine, "FlavaMen", which showcases the Flava Works models and contains editorials from contributing writers.
Blatino Awards.
In May 2009, Flava Works announced that it was launching the FlavaMen Blatino Awards, which will honor ethnic clubs, adult performers, and websites in a variety of categories.
The Chicago controversy.
In 2006, a report surfaced from the Chicago Department of Public Health, which alleged that there was a high level of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, among the models of the Cocodorm. Allegations were also made that the CocoDorm models were engaging in bareback sex. Flava Works denied the accusations contained in the report.
The "House Next Door" controversy and its legal resolution.
On May 8, 2007, NBC 6 aired a news investigation entitled, "The House Next Door." 
The investigation surfaced when neighbors and zoning authorities were sent anonymous printed copies of webpages, a DVD of a sex show and of a fight that happened at the dorm, and photos of the red brick home.
In the documentary, models were shown half dressed behind windows, and these images were juxtaposed with those of children playing in the street and unsuspecting neighbors being interviewed. The Miami Department of Code Enforcement visited the residence on May 8, 2007, and imposed five citations: (1) Illegal rooming house. Flava Works denied these allegations, on the grounds that the company was not charging any of its models for rent while they were residents in the CocoDorm. (2) Adult entertainment not permitted in C-1 zone property. Flava Works responded stating that they do not run an “Adult Entertainment” service on the property. (3) Failure to Maintain Exterior of Commercial or Residential Property. Flava Works maintained in response that the property's landscape was well maintained and cleaned. (4) Failure to maintain lot in safe, clean condition; not allowing accumulation of debris, trash or dense growth of grass. Flava Works maintained that the yard was in good condition. (5) Illegally operating a business in a residential zone. Flava Works responded that the company was not operating a business at the property; all business activities and Internet servers are located off-site.
On August 13, 2007, and after "three acrimonious public meetings … in sessions going past midnight, Miami's Code Enforcement Board ruled that Flava Works was "illegally running an adult entertainment business out of a single-family home … and ordered that those operations cease.
However, Flava Works filed a lawsuit against the City of Miami in response to the verdict, invoking First Amendment rights and arguing that it was not running an adult-oriented business out of the "House Next Door.” Flava Works also argued that business transactions do not take place in a residential neighborhood in Miami, but rather in virtual space. The case attracted some interest in legal circles.
Ruling on the case was made in January 2009, when Judge Marcia G. Cooke of the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, ruled in favor of Flava Works. She based her judgment on the precedent of a very similar case involving a heterosexual porn site, "Voyeur Dorm," operating webcams in a Tampa, Florida, residence. The judge ruling on the Voyeur Dorm case came to the conclusion that the residence provided no "offer[of adult entertainment to members of the public." The offering occurs when the videotaped images are dispersed over the internet and into the public eye for consumption 
Judge Cooke agreed, writing on the CocoDorm: "Because the public offering by Flava Works, Inc. occurs via cocodorm.com in cyberspace, and not in a particular geographic location, the City of Miami zoning ordinance cannot be applied to the 503 residence. Furthermore,
the servers necessary to transmit the live and recoded video feeds to subscribers are not housed in either the 503 residence or the North Miami avenue business office. Here, although the performers are paid to be at the residence and capture d on video, the processing and transmitting of the resulting images is done at a different location; a location not at issue in this case.
Judge Cooke's decision was featured on NBC 6 on February 3, 2009, in a story entitled, "Porn House Can Stay." The report indicated that the City of Miami's intended to appeal the decision 
The city appealed, and in June 2010 the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that regardless of whether the CocoDorm was an adult entertainment establishment, it was a business operation, and Miami zoning ordinances forbid operating a business in a residential zone. The court distinguished the Voyeur Dorm case by pointing out that the latter involved a Tampa ordinance against adult entertainment establishments, not business operations in general.
Flava Works Inc. v. Gunter lawsuit.
In 2010 Flava Works filed a lawsuit against Gunter who was operating myVidster.com claiming copyright and trademark infringement. This case became an important case in copyright law as it shows the boundaries of the safe harbour provisions in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The case resulted in a preliminary injunction in favor of Flava Works.

Age of Fire

Age of Fire is a series of fantasy/adventure novels written by E. E. Knight, who is also known for writing the "Vampire Earth" series of novels.
Plot.
The series follows the adventures of three dragon siblings. All having hatched from a clutch of five eggs carefully protected by the female dragon Irelia and her mate, bronze AuRel, the young dragons quickly establish themselves into distinct roles. Upon hatching, the males of the clutch are instinctively driven to fight each other to the death, which leads to the death of a Red hatchling, while the Copper suffers a crippled leg and must live as an outcast, leaving grey Auron to dwell with his two sisters under the protection of their parents. All four hatchlings survive their first seasons in the cavern, until an attack on their home cave results in the deaths of their mother and the female hatchling Jizara. Auron and Wistala escape into the Upper World, while the crippled Copper eventually makes his way deeper below ground. In the fantasy setting of the novels, dragon population has been dwindling as relations among the many races worsen. Humans especially are becoming the dominant species, but there are still powerful factions of dwarves, elves and other sentient species.
The first three books are written from a different sibling's point of view and occur simultaneously. They are stand-alone novels that are accessible without having read the other two.
Dragon Champion (Book 1).
Dragon Champion follows AuRon (Auron), the youngest male and clutchwinner. After being separated from Wistala, he is captured and sold to humans buying dragon hatchlings. He escapes and sets forth to seek the dragon NooMoahk because of a rumour that the ancient black knows the secret of dragonkind's supposed fatal weakness. Along the way he encounters many friends and future allies, the Dawn Roarer wolf pack, the tradesdwarf Djer, Naf the mercenary and the girl-child Hieba. AuRon studies under NooMoahk for a time and then comes to rule a small kingdom of the local blighters after the latter's death. However, the blighter ruler he had installed is killed by rivals who wish to lead all blighters to war with the humans. AuRon comes to learn of the Wyrmmaster who believes in human supremacy and wishes to wipe out the other races. The blighter war was instigated by him to destroy the other races. The Wyrmmaster is so named because he uses dragons to fight his wars; it was to him AuRon would have been sold to as a hatchling. AuRon volunteers and infiltrates to serve the Wyrmmaster and finds the "fatal" weakness of dragons: the fact that they imprint upon the first creature they see upon hatching and can then be tamed. With the help of the female dragons AuRon leads a successful uprising against the Wyrmmaster. AuRon mates with Natasatch and hopes to raise his children so that the males do not kill each other upon hatching, ending the book.
"Dragon Champion" covers a larger span of time than either of the other first three books.
Dragon Avenger (Book 2).
Dragon Avenger follows Wistala, the sole surviving female. After being separated from Auron, she tracks down their gravely-injured father and spends some weeks nursing him back to health. However, Wistala and AuRel are found by the dragon hunter Drakossozh, and after her father is killed she is forced to leap into a gorge to escape. She is rescued, unconscious and near death, by a kindhearted elf named Rainfall who becomes an adoptive father to the orphan. During her stay with Rainfall, Wistala becomes involved in a conspiracy by the local thane Hammar to claim Mossbell, Rainfalls ancestral home. She later travels with a circus as a fortune teller, briefly roaming the land after uncasing her wings in search of dragons who can help her avenge her family's deaths. After an unsuccessful meeting with a small group of ambivalent dragons in the north, Wistala returns to the circus and wins favor with a dwarf named Gobold Fangbreaker, the ruler of the Wheel of Fire and the same dwarf responsible for the murder of her parents. Wistala manipulates his downfall from a position of trust, instigating a war between the dwarves and the human barbarians of the north and sabotaging the dwarves, leading to the downfall of the stronghold. Wistala slays Gobold and later encounters the Dragonblade, who agrees to end the bloodshed between their families. The book ends with Wistala preparing to leave in search of AuRon, who she finds is still alive.
"Dragon Avenger" spans the least amount of time of the first three books, following Wistala's first 14 years or so.
Dragon Outcast (Book 3).
"Dragon Outcast" follows the copper as he explores the lower world. Meeting with blood-sucking bats and dwarves, he makes his way to a community of dragons in the Lavadome, where he is adopted into the imperial family by the current ruler, the Tyr, and named RuGaard. RuGaard deals with politics and hominids, and searches for his place in a world of treachery and war. During his stay in the Lavadome, he becomes the owner of the human thrall Rayg, the lost great-grandson of Wistala's adopted elf father. He is later forced to mate with the sickly dragonelle Halaflora by the Tyr's mate. Not long after the Tyr dies and his brother-in-law SiDrakkon becomes Tyr. Rayg succeeds in crafting a brace for the wing that Drakossozh crippled in RuGaard's infancy, enabling the Copper to fly. Emissaries of the Wyrmmaster arrive and attack the Coppers home of Anaea, shortly after SiDrakkon dies under mysterious circumstances and his nephew SiMelovant becomes Tyr and arranges peace with the invaders. After the accidental death of Halaflora, RuGaard leads a successful assault against invading dragonriders and kills the Dragonblade, Drakossozh as well as SiMelovant. With the victory, RuGaard is named Tyr (king) of the Lavadome dragons, with his drakehood love Nilrasha as his mate.
Nearly all of Dragon Outcast takes place in the lower world.
Dragon Strike (Book 4).
A mysterious plague sweeps through Lavadome forcing upon RuGaard a decision that could save or bring an end to dragon kind. Meanwhile, Wistala sets off to find AuRon and winds up falling down a deep well during a fight. Wistala is captured by Demen and becomes their "ambassador" with the Tyr of the Lavadome. AuRon leaves the Isle of Ice to find Wistala and find gold for his hatchlings. Eventually their different paths merge, bringing them together to confront their common foe, the Red Queen of the Ghioz. Dragon Strike is the fourth book, but the sequel to the first three books.
Dragon Rule (Book 5).
Perspective: AuRon, Wistala and the Copper (RuGaard)
Wistala, sister to the Copper who is now Emperor of the Upper World, has long thought humans the equal of dragons. She leads the Firemaids, fierce female fighting dragons who support the Hominids of Hypatia. Which puts her at odds with both her brothers, for the Copper has no use for the humans he now dominates, and AuRon, the rare scaleless grey, would isolate himself and his family from both the world of men and the world of dragons.
Dragon Rule is the fifth book and was released on the 1st December 2009.
Dragon Fate (Book 6).
Perspective: AuRon, Wistala and RuGaard
"Dragon Fate" starts out with RuGaard, Wistala and AuRon all taking shelter away from the Lavadome (as they were exiled in the last book). Wistala goes with DharSii to hunt a troll while AuRon has returned to visit his mate. While Wistala and DharSii are hunting, they learn that NiVom and Imfamnia have tried to take power from the twins and another clan war has broken out.
World.
Species.
Most species in "Age of Fire" are technically sentient and can speak at least one language, either specific to their species (cat, dragon) or general for their type (beast, avian). However, the focus of the series is on the dragons and their interactions with the different hominid species.
Naming conventions.
Naming styles vary by species, and may also vary by situation. Generally, certain species have certain ways in which they name their own, listed below:
Dragons: Before their wings emerge, emphasis on a dragon's name is placed on the first syllable. Once a male dragon's wings emerge, the emphasis of his name shifts to the second syllable. For this reason, adult males' names are written with the second consonant capitalized, to represent adulthood. For example, when Auron's wings emerge, his name becomes AuRon after that point. Female dragons do not follow this convention, though they may shorten their names for familiarity, such as Wistala's preference that her elf father a human family call her "Tala."
Elves: Most elves have an earthy name reflecting their close ties to nature, and involve some kind of natural object or natural occurrence in their given name – three elves through the books are named as Hazeleye, Rainfall and Halfmoon.
Griffaran: Given their slight difficulty with Drakkine, the "griffaran" naming conventions vary slightly. Many of their names are a reflection of the sounds they make, such as one of the chief "griffaran" bodyguards, Aiy-Yip.
Humans: There seem to be no strict naming conventions for humans, though there are regional differences. Men of the Ghioz have different names from men of the Ironriders' Sweep, just as one would expect a difference in names between Europe or Asia.
Wolves: Wolves are called by different names based on familiarity. When spoken by another member of their pack, the first part of their second name is combined with the first part of their first name. For instance, Bright-Sight Fey-Bark is referred to as Feybright within her pack.

Rollercoaster (Phineas and Ferb)

"Rollercoaster" is the pilot episode of the Disney Channel original animated television series "Phineas and Ferb", originally broadcast on Disney Channel on August 17, 2007, Toon Disney on September 1, 2008, and Disney XD on February 13, 2009. The episode follows series protagonists Phineas and Ferb building an extremely large roller coaster panning from their backyard to throughout the city.
"Rollercoaster" was written by co-creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff "Swampy" Marsh. Povenmire directed the episode, as well. The two used the episode to pitch the entire series to Disney. They recorded a set of storyboard reels and had Povenmire voiced them over; they then sent it overseas. The preview of the episode totaled a combined 10.8 million viewers. Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from critics.
Plot summary.
Stepbrothers Phineas (Vincent Martella) and Ferb (Thomas Sangster) are sitting lazily under the big tree in their backyard when they decide to construct a large rollercoaster. With their mother Linda (Caroline Rhea) at the grocery store, their sister Candace (Ashley Tisdale) wants to catch them in the act and "bust" them.
Candace goes to the store to tell their mom of the boys' activities, though she is keen on neglecting it. Isabella (Alyson Stoner) asks Candace at the Flynn-Fletcher house if Phineas and Ferb are home, but Candace ignores her. Isabella then goes to Phineas with hearts in her eyes and says her common catchphrase "Whatcha doin'?". She says "Isn't that impossible?" to Phineas and asks him to go swimming with her, but Phineas declines and Isabella leaves. Phineas and Ferb begin working on the coaster. Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus (Dee Bradley Baker) performs his act as a "secret Agent P", being informed by Major Francis Monogram (Jeff "Swampy" Marsh) that Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz (Dan Povenmire) has bought 80% of the tri-state area's tin foil. Perry darts off to investigate what Dr. Doofenshmirtz is doing.
With their rollercoaster finally finished, Phineas and Ferb unveil it to their entire neighborhood in a glamor-filled light show with notable guests being Isabella, Ginger, and Katie. They all rocket off on the rollercoaster, which spirals around buildings and swoops through parking lots. Doofenshmirtz, meanwhile, reveals that he is using the tin foil to cover the eastern seaboard, then using a magnet to pull it, thereby reversing the Earth's rotation; from there, he is lost. Perry fights him, resulting in the magnet activating. Doofensmirtz's idea was wrong, sending a giant ball of tin foil hurtling at them. They frantically try to stop it.
Perry attempts to solve the problem using a helicopter (causing The D.E.Inc to get hit), which inadvertently causes the rollercoaster to crumble and speed off the tracks. As they spiral around the world and eventually space, Candace continues to try and bust them, even on the way home. The magnet is stopped, as Phineas and Ferb return home, Candace a second too late. Isabella says that was the best ride ever and she and Phineas talk about Perry and that he may lay an egg. Ferb burps from having peanut butter, which Isabella says was cool, and she leaves at that point. The episode ends with the roller coaster exploding in the boys' backyard tree and Dr. Doofenshmirtz is seen rolling in the background setting. Upon the rollercoaster exploding Candace tries to bust the boys again. Mom responds by saying, "Give it a rest, Candace!"
Production.
Conception.
Series co-creator Dan Povenmire attributed the genesis for the show to his childhood in Mobile, Alabama. Povenmire recalled that his mother told him "never to waste a day of summer". Meanwhile, the show's other co-creator, Jeff "Swampy" Marsh grew up in a large, blended family. Similar to Povenmire, Marsh spent his summers exploring and taking part in several different activities in order to have fun. The two met while working as layout artists on "The Simpsons" in the 1990s. Povenmire commented that "We were always laughing at the same jokes". The two became a writing team on the Nickelodeon animated series "Rocko's Modern Life". They began working on "Phineas and Ferb" around 1992, while still working together at Nickelodeon. The two had become friends due to their mutual tastes and interests. Citing their childhood, they wanted to incorporate summer vacations, a time when the two would go out and do something constructive. They spent sixteen years pitching it to four different networks, including Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, all of which kept shooting it down due to its complexity. When Povenmire landed a pitch with Disney, despite being unsure at first, the series was accepted.
Povenmire and Marsh both wrote "Rollercoaster", and used it as the pitch for the entire series. Unlike normal series, they did not send a script to the overseas Disney executives, but set up a storyboard and mixed it over with dialogue by Povenmire, then set up a "play-by-play" and recorded it. The series was accepted after 16 years of development and the episode was produced. Several lines and scenes from the storyboard were removed or altered in the eventual production of the episode. Several such scenes were eventually used in later episodes, such as a scene later used in the episode "Gaming the System", in which Doofenshmirtz waits a few seconds, until precisely 11:00, before initiating his plan. Povenmire and Marsh wanted to include two things in every episode; a song, and an action or chase scene. However, the song in every episode did not begin until Flop Starz, the next episode.
Casting.
Vincent Martella, Thomas Sangster, and Ashley Tisdale, who voice Phineas, Ferb, and Candace respectively, were all hired by the casting department because of their popularity within the target age-group and general belief in their ability to perform their roles. Another character, Jeremy, who is usually voiced by Mitchel Musso, briefly appeared in the episode in a different voice than usual from an unknown voice extra. The end credits of the episode list several extras who possibly voiced him, including Dee Bradley Baker, Raviv Ullman, and the co-creators. The episode used live action briefly in the shot in which the kids fall to Earth, a technique featured in two other episodes to date: "Out to Launch" and "The Chronicles of Meap".
The events of "Rollercoaster" would be revisited in the season 2 episode "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo", which sees a future adult version of Candace returning to the events of the episode in a time machine to help her present counterpart successfully bust Phineas and Ferb for the rollercoaster. However, this action led to a chain reaction that soon followed, turning the future version of Danville into a dystopian society led by subplot antagonist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. Later, the same Candace goes back into the past to stop the adult Candace from causing the disaster.
Inspired by the "" episode "Trials and Tribble-ations" (which saw the crew of the newer series interacting with the events of the original series episode "The Trouble With Tribbles"), the use of "Rollercoaster" within the plot was viewed by Marsh as "a great way to interweave a story."
Broadcast.
The episode originally aired as a preview after the premiere of "High School Musical 2" on August 17, 2007, with a rating of TV-Y7. Disney Channel wanted to start off the series in a special way, though they did not to use "Rollercoaster"; instead, they choose the episode "Flop Starz", and aired it in a worldwide premiere.
Reception.
When originally aired on August 17, 2007, "Rollercoaster" peaked high ratings in several categories. The preview garnered a recorded amount of 10.8 million viewers. 4.15 million were in the demographic of kids 6–11, while 4.20 million were in the tweens 9–14 category. These high ratings lead to the episode being the second highest-rated telecast Disney Channel received in its recorded history.
Musical.
A remake of the episode aired on January 28, 2011 on Disney Channel and on Disney Channel on Demand on Verizon on January 21, 2011. It was titled "Rollercoaster: The Musical!" The episode features the original storyline, except it is put into a musical setting. It should also be noted that the original Rollercoaster is the only episode in the series to not have a musical number.
The episode included many Easter eggs from previous episodes,and references to other productions. For example, when Phineas is singing "Hey Ferb", the two of them are dressed as people from other musicals, including The Phantom of the Opera, Les Misérables, The King and I (during which Phineas is bald to look like Yul Brynner) and others. When Candace and her mother leave the supermarket, two future Candaces can be seen in the parking lot. Also, while the roller coaster is flung into space, Meap can be seen in his spaceship. For the finale of the episode, the cast of the show performed "Carpe Diem" and almost every major and minor character from previous episodes of the show made cameos in the performance, including the Goozim from the episode "Got Game?", that also appears in the . Kenny Ortega made a special cameo as the choreographer of the performance.
Various phrases from the original episode were made into songs with two songs added in the episode, including:

Oregon Nursery Company

The Oregon Nursery Company (also known as Orenco) was a nursery company founded and originally operated in Salem, Oregon, United States. The company later expanded to a site in Washington County, Oregon west of Portland. The entire operation was eventually moved to Washington County, where the company founded the town of Orenco. The company went bankrupt in 1927. Its legacy is the Orenco place name that is still widely used in the Hillsboro area.
History.
The Capital City Nursery company was founded by 1867. It originally operated from a site in Salem just east of the Willamette University campus, along State Street. The company changed its name to the Oregon Nursery Company in 1896 to reflect its expanding business. By 1904, the company was one of the largest nursery companies in the country, shipping nursery stock throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It was well known enough that Luther Burbank chose the company to propagate his Maynard plum and introduce it into the market.
By the early 1890s the Oregon Nursery Company was being run by two Canadian Scots, Malcolm McDonald and Archibald McGill. In 1896, the partners decided to expand their operation into the Portland area. They purchased of farm land in rural Washington County west of Portland, in what is now Hillsboro. When a fire destroyed the company’s packing plant in Salem in 1905, the entire business was moved to Washington County.
The first building to be built at the Washington County site was a packing shed, the largest building of its kind in the country. Because of its size the building was the home of the Washington County Fair for many years. Over the next several years, McDonald and McGill purchased additional farm land adjacent to their nursery, expanding the company’s property to . Most of the land was quickly planted with fruit trees, nut trees, shade trees, berries, and other nursery stock. In 1909, the company built a new office next to the packing shed. That same year, the Oregon Electric Railway opened a line to the Oregon Nursery Company site, offering the opportunity to further expand the company’s business.
During that time, the company began sponsoring Hungarian immigrant families into the area to add to its workforce. To accommodate its workers, the company built residential homes, utilities, a school, and a church. It also encouraged small businesses to locate in the area. As a result, the town of Orenco was founded in 1908. The town name was an acronym for ORE-gon N-ursery CO-mpany. By 1910, the town population had reached 500, and a fire department was organized. The Orenco city hall was finished in 1912. The city of Orenco was officially incorporated on 6 January 1913, and Malcolm McDonald was elected the city’s first mayor.
In 1913, the Oregon Nursery Company was at its peak of production and sales. Its were covered with millions of trees and shrubs, and its nursery stock was in great demand. On 21 June 1913, the company hosted a national horticultural event that brought three hundred nurserymen from around the country to visit the Orenco operation. A special train carried the attended from Portland to Orenco. A grand banquet was served in the packing shed, to impress the guests with the size of the building and show off company’s modern processing and distribution facilities.
Before 1916, the company had expanded production significantly, anticipating a move into the European agriculture market. The company planted more than a million apple trees specifically for that purpose. However, the outbreak of World War I ended any hope of selling nursery stock in Europe for many years. As a result of slow moving inventory that cost money to maintain and increasing competition from other nurseries, the company began losing money. It filed for bankruptcy and was dissolved in 1927.
When the company closed, the city of Orenco lost its only large employer. Some families started small nurseries of their own, but most moved away looking for work elsewhere. In 1938, eight Orenco residents, representing the community’s remaining families, voted to dissolve the city government.
Products.
The Oregon Nursery Company had numerous nursery products. Over the years, the company introduced and marketed a number of new varieties of fruits, nuts, and berries. The company sold millions of plants. During one week in 1909, a single Orenco salesman sold over 17,000 prune trees to farmers around in the central Willamette Valley community of Dallas, Oregon.
Legacy.
Today, the Orenco town site along with the rest of the Oregon Nursery Company property is part of Hillsboro, a suburb west of Portland. The house Malcolm McDonald built is a local landmark. It is sometimes called the McDonald-Russell House after McDonald, its first owner, and Eugene Russell who lived in the house while operating the Orenco Woods Golf Course in the 1960s. The house is now the "House of Ruth", a home for single mothers. Archibald McGill’s house, often called the McGill-Pitman House, still exists. It is also well known in the area.
Today, the Orenco place name is widely used in the Hillsboro area. A major development on the old nursery land is called "Orenco Station". One of the Hillsboro stops on the MAX Blue Line light-rail is "Orenco/Northwest 231st Avenue". According to the Hillsboro Chamber of Commerce and the "Orenco Station Business Owners Association", many Hillsboro businesses still use the Orenco name including retail stores, apartments complexes, at least four restaurants, three banks, a number of professional offices, and a real estate company. In addition, the former Orenco Woods Golf Course is built on land once owned by the Oregon Nursery Company. There is also an "Orenco Elementary School" in the Hillsboro School District.

Ellis Worth

Ellis Worth (c. 1587 – 1659), or Woorth, was a noted English actor in the Jacobean and Caroline eras. He was a leading member of two important companies, Queen Anne's Men and Prince Charles's Men.
Nothing is known of Worth's origins or early life, or the start of his career; he was with the Queen Anne's company by 1615, and continued with the troupe until it dissolved in 1623. The paucity of the extant historical record means that little is known of the roles he played; he was most likely the "Ellis" who played a Lord in Robert Daborne's "The Poor Man's Comfort" around 1617. After 1623, Worth was a member of what is usually called the Company of the Revels at the Red Bull Theatre, and sometimes simply the Red Bull company; little is known of their activities. 
When Richard Gunnell built his Salisbury Court Theatre in 1629, he needed a company to act there. He brought in the new or second version of Prince Charles's Men. Worth was an original member and a "sharer" (partner) in this organization from 1631 to at least 1638, and probably until the theatres were closed in 1642 at the start of the English Civil War. He played Ardelio in the troupe's December 1631 production of Marmion's "Holland's Leaguer".
Much of what is known of Worth's career comes from legal documents that pertain to the various controversies in which his companies were involved. The long legal battle between Susan Baskervile and Queen Anne's Men is one obvious example; that lawsuit is often known as the Worth/Baskervile suit, or Worth v. Baskervile, since Worth, due to his leading position in the troupe, was listed first among the roster of actors Baskervile sued. Susan Baskervile. Worth also testified in the "Keep the Widow Waking" suit in 1624 (though he testified that he had nothing to do with the play). 
The second Prince Charles's company also had a tempestuous and litigious career, and Worth was deeply enmeshed in its controversies. Worth and Andrew Cane, the troupe's leaders, were sued by fellow actor William Bankes in 1635. Bankes invested £100 to become an actor/sharer in the company, but was unhappy with the results.
Even after the theatres were closed, the litigation continued; Worth gave a deposition in a Chancery suit in February 1654, in which, coincidentally, he identifies himself as "of the age of 67 or thereabouts." 
Worth's daughter Jane was christened in July 1613. The girl's mother died sometime before 1626, when Worth married the widow of Thomas Holcombe. Their son Elizeus was christened in March 1629.
For a couple of centuries, nothing was known about Worth's later years; even the year of his death was mysterious. The discovery of his last will and testament provided some valuable data on his family and surviving descendants. Regrettably, the will contains no mention of actors; Worth's colleagues had largely passed from the scene by 1659.

Diamond Shoal Light

Diamond Shoal Light was an off-shore lighthouse marking Diamond Shoals off Cape Hatteras.
History.
Diamond Shoals, which extend many miles out from Cape Hatteras, is considered to be one of the most dangerous spots on the Atlantic seaboard. While a light was exhibited from the cape itself from 1804, its range was insufficient, and a lightship was stationed on the shoal itself in 1824. It was driven off station numerous times, eventually being wrecked near Ocracoke Inlet in 1827. Various buoys were placed beginning in 1852, but all were short-lived.
In 1889 congress authorized construction of a permanent lighthouse on the shoal, at a cost not to exceed $500,000. The firm of Anderson & Barr, which had constructed the Fourteen Foot Bank Light in Delaware Bay in 1885-1887, was awarded the contract. A caisson was constructed in Norfolk, Virginia and towed to the site in June 1891. It was sunk into the shoal on July 1 and immediately began to tilt due to the sandy bottom and severe scour by the currents. Addition of iron plates at the top of the structure merely succeeded in keeping it marginally above water. A storm on July 4 drove the work crews away and destroyed the structure. Anderson, who supervised the construction, later claimed that the problem was exacerbated by out of date charts with inaccurate soundings. In any case, construction was abandoned, and $79,000 of the original appropriation was diverted to the construction of a lightship to replace the failed tower.
That lightship, "LV 69", was the first of six lightships employed at Diamond Shoals in the twentieth century. Prior to World War I, lightships were assigned in pairs at this station, which each relieving the other; after "LV 71" was sunk by the German submarine "U-104", a single ship was assigned, relieved as needed. During World War II the lightship was replaced by a lighted buoy. The last lightship stationed here, "WLV 189", was the first lightship built after the Coast Guard took over the Lighthouse Service, and the first all-welded lightship; it was expressly built for service at this station, and remained in service there until 1966.
In the early 1960s, "Texas Tower" lighthouses were erected at six offshore sites on the East coast. Diamond Shoals was the second to last to be built, and was activated in 1966; it was automated in 1977. The unmanned lighthouse suffered significant damage from Hurricane Fran in 1996, and the catwalks were subsequently found to be so rotten that the light could only be safely visited by helicopter. The light was extinguished in 2001, and has since been removed.
Although the light was removed, the tower still stands and is frequented by fishermen for the many species of fish that live below and near it. Amberjack and barracuda are some of the larger fish that call Diamond Shoals light tower their home.
In October 2012 the tower was purchased at auction by a citizen who plans to restore it.
Two photos appearing on the new owner's Facebook page in 2013, and in Wikimedia dated June 2012, shows storms since the USCG inspection report dated January 2012 have knocked out several large sections of the K-bracing at the waterline, severely compromising the stability of the tower and its resistance to future storms. A more recent photo apparently dated July 2013 shows a third horizontal brace, on the side with the boat lift, may have fallen off.

Transportation in Indianapolis

Indianapolis is served by many different kinds of transportation.
Airports.
Indianapolis International Airport, identified as IND, is the largest airport in Indiana and serves the Indianapolis Metropolitan Area. In addition to a recently completed air traffic control tower, the Indianapolis Airport Authority built a new midfield terminal, two new parking garages and apron improvements. The new terminal was built with the intent of easing passenger access. Constructed between the two existing runways, the new terminal has 40 gates and two concourses. The new Indianapolis International Airport opened for arrivals on November 11, 2008, and departures on the following morning. There are also plans for a third parallel runway south of I-70.
FedEx Express, a cargo airline, operates a national hub out of IND and is the second largest hub operation in the world behind only the Superhub in Memphis. FedEx plans to continue expanding the hub along Interstate 70 or possibly where the old passenger terminal remains. Adding onto the FedEx ramp will allow more wide-body aircraft and more direct flights from IND to FedEx hubs in Europe and Asia.
Cargolux and Nippon Cargo Airlines also operate out of IND.
Indianapolis is a focus city for AirTran Airways. AirTran plans to increase service to and from IND, including the addition of a Las Vegas flight in March 2011.
Highways.
Interstate highways.
Several interstates serve the Indianapolis area:
Mass transit.
The Indianapolis Public Transportation Corporation, known locally as IndyGo, provides public transportation for the city. IndyGo was established in 1975 after the city of Indianapolis took over privately owned Indianapolis Transit Systems, Inc. Prior to 1997, IndyGo was called Metro. Central Indiana Commuter Services (CICS), funded by IndyGo to reduce pollution, serves Indianapolis and surrounding counties.
Historically, Indianapolis had an extensive network of streetcar routes. In 1953, the last streetcars ran in the city. Trolleybuses made their last run in the city four years later in 1957, leaving the city with an all-bus transit system. The Downtown Indianapolis Streetcar Corp., a not-for-profit organization, is investigating the feasibility of a streetcar line to serve various downtown destinations. 
A report prepared by Purdue University indicates that buses running on a fuel containing 10 percent biodiesel are likely to help Indianapolis mass transit reduce pollution without compromising fuel economy. The report also suggests introducing more hybrid diesel-electric buses and a fuel containing 20 percent biodiesel (BD20) would further reduce emissions and petroleum consumption.
People mover.
The public-use Indiana University Health (formerly Clarian Health) people mover connects the Indiana University School of Medicine, Riley Hospital for Children, Wishard Hospital and IUPUI & Indiana University School of Medicine facilities at the north end of the Downtown Canal with Methodist Hospital. The people mover is sometimes inaccurately described as a monorail, but in fact rides on dual concrete beams with the guideway as wide as the vehicle.
Intercity Transportation.
Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Indianapolis at the Indianapolis Union Station. Amtrak provides a thrice-weekly service of the "Cardinal" to Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. and the daily "Hoosier State" to Chicago.
Greyhound Lines also operates a terminal from Union Station downtown.
Transportation issues.
Although Indianapolis has managed to sustain a relatively low amount of traffic congestion for a city of its population, this is mostly because the city covers , an area much larger than most cities with roughly 840000 people. Indianapolis's low population density might also be the reason the city has yet to further develop its mass transit bus system or a heavy or light rail network. Among urbanized areas with 1,000,000 population or greater in the United States, Indianapolis ranked tenth in freeway lane miles per 1,000 population and eighth in freeway-equivalent miles per 1,000 population. 
As the 13th-largest city in the U.S., Indianapolis has repeatedly been ranked below 40th in mass transit availability.
However at recent city, county, metropolitan, and state-wide meetings, the idea of a heavy rail transportation service has been seriously considered. It would be a four rail system originating at downtown and stretching north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest to the city's suburban areas. The system would be called IndyGo.
Some complaints include:
There are other concerns over a lack of safe walking paths in many areas of the city. Many suburbs which were incorporated in the 1960s and 1970s are now relatively near the center of the city, and don’t have sidewalks. This often forces pedestrians to navigate a narrow road shoulder near high-speed automobile traffic.

Virginia deGravelles

Mary Virginia Wheadon deGravelles (born December 4, 1915) is a retiree from Lafayette who was the Louisiana Republican national committeewoman from 1964–1968, a position which constitutes automatic membership on the Republican National Committee. Her husband, Charles Camille deGravelles, Jr. (1913–2008), an oil and gas landman, was the state party chairman from 1968–1972 and is considered to have been one of the founders of the modern Louisiana GOP. In 1968, when Mrs. deGravelles (pronounced DE GRA VELLES) vacated the national committee position, her state party had only 28,427 registered members, barely 2 percent of the state's voters.
For a brief time in 1968, both deGravelleses were on the Republican National Committee, a husband-wife combination that has not since repeated itself.
Family and education.
Virginia deGravelles (pronounced De GRA Vell) was born in Alexandria, the seat of Rapides Parish and the largest city in Central Louisiana, to John Samuel Butler Wheadon (1883-1952) and the former Anna Kilpatrick (1887-1970) and are interred at Mt. Olivet Episcopal Cemetery in Pineville. Her father managed the former Rapides Hotel, built in 1898 at the intersection of Second and Washington streets. Its three stories contained sixty-four rooms and an excellent restaurant. An elevator was added in 1914. Wheadon also leased the Stonewall Hotel at Third and Jackson streets. The building was torn down about 1960. Mrs. Anna Wheadon was a homemaker and a legal secretary. Virginia lived next door for a time to the family of Nauman Steele Scott, I. Nauman Scott, II (1916–2001), with whom she recalls having ridden tricycles together, became a Republican-appointed U.S. District Judge in the Western District of Louisiana, based in Alexandria. Virginia's grandfather was a sheriff, and her great-grandfather was a judge. She graduated from Bolton High School in Alexandria in 1931, then the only public high school available, and attended Northwestern State University (then Louisiana Normal School) in Natchitoches for two years. Thereafter, she transferred to Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, where she received her degree in education and met Charles, who grew up in Thibodaux, the seat of Lafourche Parish. In 1960, Mrs. deGravelles completed graduate studies at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.
On September 14, 1935, the couple eloped and were wed by a justice of the peace in Woodville in Wilkinson County, Mississippi. They had five children, twin sons (born 1949) and three daughters, one, Mary Alix deGravelles, deceased. The sons are Charles Nations deGravelles, a former Episcopal archdeacon, and John W. deGravelles, an attorney, both of Baton Rouge. The daughters are Elizabeth Claire Cloninger (husband Spike Cloninger), a writer of books and contemporary Christian music in Fairhope in Baldwin County near Mobile, and Virginia Ann McBride Norton of Bali, Indonesia. Son-in-law Ed Norton works for the Nature Conservancy on ecological issues, while Ann is a photographer with her own company, Photo Voice. In 2008, Mrs. deGravelles had thirteen grandchildren, sixteen great-grandchildren, and one great-great-grandchild.
Republican politics.
The deGravelleses became active in local, state, and national politics. In 1941, they became the first two whites in many years to register as Republicans in Lafayette Parish. The only declared Republicans then were a few African Americans, who were then frozen out of the pivotal Democratic primaries. She is hence among the small number of the oldest living Republicans in the state of Louisiana. Francis Grevemberg (1914–2008) of New Orleans, the Republican candidate for governor in 1960, did not join the party until 1959, the same year that former Lafayette Mayor Dud Lastrapes, as a 30-year-old, switched parties. In time, Republicans even came to dominate Lafayette Parish.
Early in 1964, the deGravelles supported Charlton Havard Lyons, Sr., an oilman from Shreveport in Caddo Parish in northwestern Louisiana, for the governorship. Lyons was the first GOP gubernatorial candidate since Reconstruction to wage an active campaign for the office. Grevemberg four years before Lyons was mostly ignored by voters and the media. Mrs. deGravelles recalls Lyons as "a wonderful, compassionate man," who pioneered the development of the two-party system in Louisiana. Charles deGravelles succeeded Lyons as state party chairman. Mrs. deGravelleses was a delegate to the 1964 Republican National Convention, which met in the Cow Palace in San Francisco to nominate then U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater for the American presidency, considered to have been a breakthrough by conservatives.
Organizations and honors.
Mrs. deGravelles, who is Episcopalian, is a member of the Huguenot Society. She has been a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution for more than a half-century. She is also affiliated with the Louisiana Genealogical and Historical Society, and Kappa Delta sorority. 
Charles and Virginia deGravelles won several joint awards, primarily for their two-party and Republican activities. They were honored by the conservative Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge (Pennsylvania) and by the Louisiana GOP for lifetime achievement. On January 27, 2007, the deGravelleses were inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield, traditional home of the Long political dynasty. They were the first couple honored together by the organization, which was established in 1993 to recognize Louisiana political powerhouses.

<doc id="19296148" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19296148" title="Spermatocytic seminoma">
Spermatocytic seminoma

Spermatocytic seminoma is a neoplasm of the testis ("i.e." a tumour of the testis), and classified as a germ cell tumour.
The name of the tumour comes from the similarity (under the microscope) between the small cells of the tumour and secondary spermatocytes.
Relation to seminoma.
Spermatocytic seminoma is not considered a subtype of seminoma and, unlike seminoma and most other germ cell tumours, it does not arise from "intratubular germ cell neoplasia". It has not been described as arising in locations outside the testis, and does not occur in association with other germ cell tumours.
Presentation.
Spermatocytic seminoma is a rare tumour, comprising only one to two percent of all testicular germ cell tumours. Men presenting with this tumour are generally 50 to 60 years old, and its occurrence is rare in men under 30 years old. Most present with slow, painless testicular enlargement, which may involve both testes.
Diagnosis.
Spermatocytic seminomas are diagnosed based on tissue from orchiectomy (or partial orchiectomy), done for a lesion suspicious for cancer on medical imaging.
The macroscopic appearance of the tumour is of a mutinodular grey-white to tan coloured mass with gelatinous, haemorrhagic and necrotic areas. The tumour may extend beyond the testis.
Histologic appearance.
Histologically, spermatocytic seminomas consist of three cell populations:
The cells are generally packed into nodules, and have a loose, sheet-like arrangement that is commonly interrupted by interstitial oedema. Unlike classical seminoma, fibrous septation and lymphocytic infiltrates are not seen. Cells undergoing mitosis are common, as are cells undergoing apoptosis.
Intratubular growth of spermatocytic seminoma can be seen, however there is no intratubular germ cell neoplasia of unspecified type (IGCNU). The intratubular growth probably accounts for the appearance of separate tumour nodules within the testis.
Immunostaining for most of the usual testicular germ cell tumour markers is negative ("i.e. placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), vimentin, actin, desmin, alpha fetoprotein (AFP), OCT4, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)).
Rarely, spermatocytic seminomas may show sarcomatoid differentiation, most commonly as undifferentiated spindled cells intermingled within the typical-appearing spermatocytic seminoma cells. Rhabdomyosarcomatous differention has also been described.
Treatment.
Unlike classical seminoma, spermatocytic seminomas rarely metastasise, so radical orchidectomy alone is sufficient treatment, and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy are generally not required.

Berwyn Heights, Maryland mayor's residence drug raid

The Berwyn Heights mayor's residence drug raid was a controversial action taken by the Prince George's County, Maryland, Sheriff's Office and Police Department at the home of Berwyn Heights mayor Cheye Calvo on July 29, 2008. The raid was the culmination of an investigation that began in Arizona, where a package containing 32 pounds of marijuana was intercepted in a warehouse, addressed to the mayor's residence. In spite of intercepting the package in transit, the police allowed the package to be delivered. Once the package arrived at the house, a SWAT team raided and held the mayor and his mother-in-law at gunpoint, and shot and killed his two dogs, one while it attempted to run away.
The event gained national and international media attention. While the Calvos were cleared of wrongdoing, the police were accused by the Calvos and civil rights groups of lacking a proper search warrant, excessive force, and failure to conduct a proper background investigation of the home being raided. Despite the criticisms, no action has been taken against the officers or their respective police departments. In August 2010, Sheriff Jackson stated that "we'd do it again. Tonight."
Raid.
On July 29, 2008, a SWAT team from the Sheriff's Office, agents of the State of Maryland, executing a search warrant and assisting the separate County Police, conducted a raid on the home of Berwyn Heights Mayor Cheye Calvo. The raid was initiated after the Mayor brought a package delivered by the SWAT team into his home. A drug-sniffing dog in Arizona had determined that the package—addressed to the Mayor's wife—contained 32 pounds of marijuana. While taking control of the residence, Sheriff's deputies shot Calvo's two pet Labrador retrievers, including one who was cited by Calvo to be running away from officers. Calvo and his mother-in-law were handcuffed and questioned for several hours, with Calvo wearing just underwear.
Response of law enforcement agencies.
The incident received wide coverage in the United States and abroad. Immediately following the raid, both the Sheriff's Office and County Police stated that the Berwyn Heights raid was proper because of the large quantity of drugs involved.
On August 7, 2008, Mayor Calvo called for a federal investigation of the incident by the U.S. Department of Justice. The local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) also requested an investigation. In early August, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began a civil rights investigation into the incident.
On August 8, 2008, the County Police cleared the Calvos of any wrongdoing relating to the drug shipment. Chief of Police Melvin High called the Calvos "innocent victims" who were caught up in the drug trafficking ring. While High said he regretted the loss of the Calvo's dogs, he did not apologize for the actions taken by his officers.
In a press conference on the same day as High's exoneration, Sheriff Michael A. Jackson defended the conduct of the deputies who conducted the raid. However, an internal investigation was launched as with any incident involving the discharge of a deputy's weapon. The results of the investigation, released on September 4, 2008, concluded the conduct of the deputies was appropriate and no wrongdoing was committed. According to the report, the first dog was shot after "engaging an officer" and the second was seen "running towards a second officer" and shot as well.
As of December 2008, the county police has indicated their investigation is not complete. The FBI is still monitoring the situation. In August 2010 while campaigning to be elected county executive, Sheriff Jackson stated, “We′ve apologized for the incident, but we will never apologize for taking drugs off our streets...Quite frankly, we′d do it again. Tonight.”
Criticism of police actions.
Improper search warrant.
During the interrogation, Calvo repeatedly requested to see the search warrant, but his lawyer stated no copy was provided until three days later. A County Police spokesman initially stated that a no-knock warrant had been issued for Calvo's home. However, after Calvo's lawyer challenged that statement and media published copies of the warrant, the commander of the county's narcotics enforcement division stated that no-knock warrants do not exist in the county. However, no-knock warrants were clarified in a 2005 law, sponsored by Baltimore Delegate Curt Anderson, that limits their use to suspects fleeing into a house, or if a suspect is considered armed or is attempting to destroy evidence.
Lack of a background investigation.
During interrogation, Calvo stated that officers did not believe he was the Mayor and for a time refused his request that they contact the Berwyn Heights Police Department (which was unaware of the raid) to confirm his identity. Police Chief High stated his department did not know the home was owned by the mayor and his wife.
Patrick Murphy, chief of police for the Berwyn Heights Police Department, was especially critical of the county police. Murphy argued that the raid could have been prevented if his department had handled the situation, stating "you can't tell me the chief of police of a municipality wouldn't have been able to knock on the door of the mayor of that municipality, gain his confidence and enter the residence". Furthermore, according to Mayor Calvo, a memorandum of understanding between the county and the city requires county police to inform the city if an operation is being conducted within their jurisdiction.
Use of excessive force.
In an editorial a week after the shooting, "The Washington Post" criticized the actions of police officers as "a Keystone Cops operation from start to finish", alluding to the lack of proper execution by the sheriff's office's SWAT team. Additionally, groups such as the Cato Institute were critical of the operation and used it as an example of the dangers of the War on Drugs and the militarization of local police departments in the United States. Marc Fisher of the "Post" also related this incident to the growing prevalence of SWAT units, even in small jurisdictions, noting a massive increase in the amount of SWAT deployments since the mid-1980s.
Further criticism was leveled against the sheriff's office's deputies for the shooting of Calvo's two dogs. Contrary to the official internal investigations conducted by the sheriff's office and the county, Calvo stated his dogs were not a threat to the deputies. To support his claims, Calvo paid for a necropsy to be conducted on each dog by the Maryland Department of Agriculture. According to the results, one dog was shot four times, including twice in the head and chest. The other dog was shot twice, including once in the back of the leg which bolsters Calvo's argument that the dog was fleeing and that the force used was "unbelievably excessive". This version of events was also confirmed by the later testimony of a law enforcement officer present at the raid.
Aftermath.
Later arrests.
Prince George's County Police later arrested two men in a drug trafficking plan involving the shipment of large parcels of marijuana to addresses of uninvolved residents. After each parcel was delivered outside the addressee's home, another individual would retrieve the drugs. Police seized six packages containing
417 pounds of marijuana.
Prince George's County Sheriff's Office internal investigation.
On June 19, 2009, the Prince George's County Sheriff's Office issued a report of an internal investigation that cleared its deputies of any wrongdoing in the Berwyn Heights raid. Prince George's County Sheriff Michael Jackson said during a press conference that the findings of the report "are consistent with what I've felt all along: My deputies did their job to the fullest extent of their abilities...In the sense that we kept these drugs from reaching our streets, this operation was a success." Jackson's explanation did not address the fact that the package was intercepted in the FedEx warehouse and delivered under police supervision.
During the press conference, Jackson gave the first apology for the raid by a county official. "I am sorry for the impact this has had on Mayor Calvo, Ms. Tomsic and Ms. Porter and for the loss of their family pets," Jackson said. "It is extremely unfortunate that a felonious drug trafficker involved this family in his criminal enterprise."
In response to the report, Cheye Calvo issued the following statement: "By commending his deputies for their actions, the Sheriff is placing other innocent families and innocent family pets at risk. There is no excuse for the no-knock entry into our home, the killing of Payton and Chase, and the prolonged handcuffing of my mother-in-law and myself."
Lawsuit.
A lawsuit was filed in June 2009 against Prince George's County Sheriff Michael Jackson; Detective Shawn Scarlata; the state of Maryland; Prince George's County; and two "John Doe" deputy sheriffs, whose names were not immediately released. In depositions, law enforcement personnel admitted that at least one of the dogs was running away when shot. In January 2011, the suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money and various SWAT reforms.

Facivermis

Facivermis (meaning "torch worm" ) is an enigmatic organism from the Lower Cambrian Maotianshan shales of China 
Anatomy.
"Facivermis" was a worm-like creature up to 55 mm long. Its body was divided into three sections. The anterior section had five equally-sized pairs of appendages with two setal rows along the margins. The middle section was elongate and five times longer than the anterior or posterior. The posterior section was pear-shaped and had three rows of hooks surrounding the anus.
Classification.
"Facivermis" was considered by its describers to be a polychaete worm. An affinity to the unusual crustacean lineage Pentastomida has also been proposed, but is seen as unlikely. Since its discovery, however, most evidence has supported its being a lobopod. Liu "et al." draw a comparison to the known lobopod "Miraluolishania". Liu "et al." also note that the pear-shaped end bears a close resemblance to the proboscis of priapulid worms if it is interpreted as being the anterior end. The possible priapulid "Xishania" "longiusula"'s fragmentary remains closely resembles the pear-shaped end of "Facivermis", so Huang "et al." assigned "X".

Hanna Neumann conjecture

In the mathematical subject of group theory, the Hanna Neumann conjecture is a statement about the rank of the intersection of two finitely generated subgroups of a free group. The conjecture was posed by Hanna Neumann in 1957. In 2011, the conjecture was proved independently by Igor Mineyev and Joel Friedman. 
History.
The subject of the conjecture was originally motivated by a 1954 theorem of Howson who proved that the intersection of any two finitely generated subgroups of a free group is always finitely generated, that is, has finite rank. In this paper Howson proved that if "H" and "K" are subgroups of a free group "F"("X") of finite ranks "n" ≥ 1 and "m" ≥ 1 then the rank "s" of "H" ∩ "K" satisfies:
In a 1956 paper Hanna Neumann improved this bound by showing that : 
In a 1957 addendum, Hanna Neumann further improved this bound to show that under the above assumptions
She also conjectured that the factor of 2 in the above inequality is not necessary and that one always has
This statement became known as the "Hanna Neumann conjecture".
Formal statement.
Let "H", "K" ≤ "F"("X") be two nontrivial finitely generated subgroups of a free group "F"("X") and let "L" = "H" ∩ "K" be the intersection of "H" and "K". The conjecture says that in this case
Here for a group "G" the quantity rank("G") is the rank of "G", that is, the smallest size of a generating set for "G".
Every subgroup of a free group is known to be free itself and the rank of a free group is equal to the size of any free basis of that free group.
Strengthened Hanna Neumann conjecture.
If "H", "K" ≤ "G" are two subgroups of a group "G" and if "a", "b" ∈ "G" define the same double coset "HaK = HbK" then the subgroups "H" ∩ "aKa"−1 and "H" ∩ "bKb"−1 are conjugate in "G" and thus have the same rank. It is known that if "H", "K" ≤ "F"("X") are finitely generated subgroups of a finitely generated free group "F"("X") then there exist at most finitely many double coset classes "HaK" in "F"("X") such that "H" ∩ "aKa"−1 ≠ {1}. Suppose that at least one such double coset exists and let "a"1...,"a""n" be all the distinct representatives of such double cosets. The "strengthened Hanna Neumann conjecture", formulated by her son Walter Neumann (1990), states that in this situation

Sarotrocercus

Sarotrocercus is a small Cambrian organism known from Burgess shale-type localities, reaching a centimetre or two in length. It was pelagic and swam on its back. It may lie in the arthropod crown group, and a recent study has revised some points of its original description.
Morphology.
It had a head shield followed by a body of nine segments and a caudal tip featuring a series of spines on the end. A pair of big eyes at the end of stalks emerged from the front of the shield. The head bore a pair of sturdy appendages that ended in a bidentate segment. Ten pairs of appendages with an elongated structure of comb-shaped, probably gill branches, are attached to the at the head segment (one pair) and the body segments (nine pairs).
Ecology.
This small animal was a creature that swam freely on its back, moving perhaps through movements of the gills and the action of its the long tail tuft. The Burgess Shale contains few swimming organisms; the submarine landslides that buried organisms mainly smothered benthic and nektobenthic organisms. Organisms living in the water column above this habitat were able to escape and above the 'danger zone' and are therefore much rarer. Among these are the notable "Amiskwia", "Nectocaris" and "Anomalocaris".

"Sunday Morning" is a song by Canadian hip hop musician k-os, released as a single from his 2007 album "". The song peaked at number 19 on the Canadian Singles Chart making it K-os's 2nd highest charting song. The song made #5 on The MuchMusic Countdown. Sunday Morning was performed on The Late Show in early 2007. The song was also performed on the Vans Warped Tour 2007.
Music video.
The music video consists of three parts. Part one shows k-os outside talking with a friend before a show. Suddenly a child comes by saying that the drummer for the performance is sick and cannot make it. K-os quickly finds a skilled drummer, Sebastien Grainger, close by playing on buckets in the street. When two girls try to go in with the drummer, he tells them to wait there.
The women quickly think that he is being cruel, and a thought bubble appears above both of them with a broken heart often used as comedy. Later in part two, K-os sings at a school dance in a 1980's or 1990s theme with photos taken. Part three is k-os walking in a beautiful grassy hillside with an acoustic guitar.

Journey into Fear (1943 film)

Journey into Fear is a 1943 American spy film based on the Eric Ambler novel of the same name. The film broadly follows the plot of the book, but the protagonist was changed to an American engineer.
In addition to acting in and producing the film, Orson Welles was to direct, but had to ostensibly leave that aspect to Norman Foster due to other commitments. However, the film looks nothing like any of Foster's other films, but is instead full of directorial touches found in films directed by Welles. Many of Welles' Mercury Theatre associates were cast, including Joseph Cotten, who played the lead role and also co-wrote the screenplay.
In 2005, an alternate cut was shown at a Welles film retrospective at the Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland. It was the original European release print, lacking the narration and ending of the U.S. version but including about six minutes of footage deleted by RKO Pictures.
Plot.
In an opening scene before the credits an assassin, Banat, is seen preparing a gun while a gramophone skips as it plays . The story that follows is the narrative of a letter from Howard Graham, an American armaments engineer, to his wife Stephanie. While journeying to the Soviet port of Batumi to return to the United States to complete his business with the Turkish Navy, Graham and his wife stop in Istanbul and are met by Kopeikin, a Turkish employee of Graham's company, who under the pretense of discussing business, takes Graham to a nightclub to introduce him to dancer Josette Maretl and her partner Gogo. When Banat tries to kill Graham during a magic act, he shoots the magician instead, and Graham is brought to the headquarters of the Turkish secret police for questioning. Colonel Haki of the secret police warns Graham that German agents are trying to kill him to delay the re-arming of Turkish ships. He shows Graham a photograph of Banat, whom he says was hired by a Nazi agent named Muller, and orders Graham to travel secretly to Batumi aboard a tramp steamer instead of by train. Haki assures him that he will personally see that Stephanie gets to their hotel in Batumi ahead of him.
Graham's fellow passengers include Josette and Gogo; Kuvetli, an ingratiating Turkish tobacco salesman; Professor Haller, an apolitical German archeologist; and the henpecked Matthews and his French wife. Josette sees that Graham is frightened, and not knowing that he is married, tries to become close to him. At an interim port call, Graham is made aware of the arrival of a new passenger by the annoying clamor of a gramophone, while Haller warns him that Kuvetli is not who he claims to be. At dinner Graham recognizes Banat and tries to persuade the ship's captain and purser to put him ashore, but they believe that he is crazy. Graham turns to Josette for help and she has Gogo engage Banat in a poker game while Graham unsuccessfully searches Banat's cabin for the assassin's gun.
When Graham returns to his own cabin, he is met by an armed Haller and deduces that he is actually Muller. Muller offers to spare Graham's life by delaying his return to the States for six weeks by having him taken to a hospital with a case of "typhus." Muller warns him that Kuvetli is a Turkish agent sent by Haki and warns Graham he will be killed if he confides the plan to the Turk. Kuvetli was eavesdropping from the next cabin, however, and informs Graham that Muller's "plan" is just a scheme to get Graham away from the ship before murdering him. Kuvetli instructs Graham to pretend to agree to the plan but before the ship docks in Batumi to hide himself in an empty cabin while the Turkish agent arranges for the arrest of the German agents. When Graham goes to the empty cabin, he finds Kuvetli dead on the floor, murdered by Banat. Graham asks Mathews to deliver a message to the Turkish consul in Batumi to notify Haki. Matthews gives the unarmed Graham a pocket knife. Graham runs into Gogo, who bluntly offers to "give up" Josette for Graham to marry for a cash consideration.
Muller and Banat coerce Graham into a waiting car. When the car has a flat tire, Graham jams Matthews' pocket knife into the horn, and in the ensuing commotion, jumps into the driver's seat, crashes the car into a shop window and escapes. That night, as a storm rages, Graham joins his wife at their hotel, but Muller arrives there first, impersonating a coworker from Graham's company. Banat intimidates Graham from leaving and Muller persuades Stephanie to join Haki downstairs while he "talks business" with Graham. He leaves Graham to be killed by Banat, but Gogo enters the room to promote his deal for Josette and Banat shoots at him. Graham flees out of the room's window onto the cornice of the building in the torrential rain, pursued by Banat and Muller. Trapped between them, he is saved when Haki appears and shoots Muller. Banat wounds Haki but blinded by the rain, misses Graham. The two struggle and Banat falls to his death. Back in the present, Haki tells Graham as he finishes the letter that Stephanie is waiting for him but wonders why the engineer took decisive action when he had been so indecisive before. Graham tears up the now completed letter and tells Haki that he simply got mad and wasn't going to take any more.
Production.
The film was directed by Norman Foster, but many have speculated that there was directorial input by Orson Welles. Welles told Peter Bogdanovich that they were in such a rush to complete his scenes before Welles departed for Brazil to film "It's All True" that the person directing was whoever was closest to the camera, but Welles also stated in the very same book that he did not direct any part of the film and his friend Foster was the director. 
Welles did produce and design the picture and wrote the script with Joseph Cotten. Welles' main contribution as producer was the beginning pre-credit sequence showing the assassin listening to an old phonograph, which then starts to skip. The camera "floats" up to his apartment room from outside, much in the style of certain crane shots in "Citizen Kane". In the book "This is Orson Welles", Welles states that he thought he was the first to come up with a scene before the credits; he later learned that there were a couple of movies that did this in the late thirties.

(Cymene)ruthenium dichloride dimer

(Cymene)ruthenium dichloride dimer is the organometallic compound with the formula [(cymene)RuCl2]2. This red-coloured, diamagnetic solid is a reagent in organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis.
Preparation and reactions.
The dimer is prepared by the reaction of the phellandrene with hydrated ruthenium trichloride. Upon heating, [(cymene)RuCl2]2 undergoes exchange with other arenes, releasing free p-cymene. This dimeric molecule cleaves easily in the presence of Lewis bases to give monomeric adducts:
Such monomers adopt pseudo-octahedral piano-stool structures. 
Treatment of [(cymene)RuCl2]2 with the chelating anionic ligand precursor TsDPENH gives (cymene)Ru(TsDPEN-H), a catalyst for asymmetric transfer hydrogenation.
New catalysts.
[(cymene)RuCl2]2 is also used to prepare catalysts (by monomerization with dppf) used in borrowing hydrogen catalysis, a catalytic reaction that is based on the activation of alcohols towards nucleophilic attacks.

Mind Garage Early Years

Mind Garage-Early Years (A Total Electric Happening) was recorded by the Mind Garage, the first hard rock band recognized nationally as a Christian Rock band when America tuned into a Christian rock worship service in 1969 on ABC TV. The song, "Water" was used in the service. The term "Christian rock" had not yet been coined in 1968 and these compositions can be considered the missing link between secular and Christian rock music.
History.
The group's purpose was to make a demonstration record to interest a recording company in signing the group. Seven of the songs were recorded at Glen Campbell Studio in Pittsburgh, Pa. Asphalt Mother and Reach Out were recorded the same year, 1968, at Bell Sound Studio, Long Island, New York and released on the Morning Glori Music label as a 45 RPM single. The remaining tracks were not released until 2006, 38 years later. 
The band received several 33 rpm acetates of the Glenn Cambell Session to be used as demos but the studio kept the Master Tape. One of the demos accomplished the purpose of getting the band signed to RCA and commercially packaged records of the session were never ordered. The Master Tape was used again and recorded over as was the custom in many small studios in the 60s. Except for a brief appearance in 1983, when five cassette tapes were made from the only known remaining acetate, the acetate and the cassettes remained out of sight, and out of mind. 
The acetate itself was lost sometime during the next 21 years but in 2004 one of the cassettes surfaced and a CD was made from it. It was remastered twice to improve the sound, but the quality was inferior. Late in 2005 a cassette of vastly better sound quality appeared in the possession of Evan Jones, who had received one of the five original cassettes, and the CD was remastered again by Rick Ravenscroft of Rave Cave Records. Audiophiles will not hear perfect digital quality but collectors and fans will enjoy the raw, rock and roll sounds mastered from best possible sources.

He wrote on Architecture with the understanding and skill of a truly artistic temperament.” Another noted literature, Puro Santillan Castrence, has this to say “One of the country’s most reliable essayist in English . . . Mallari’s forte in his essays was in his use of simple words neatly and economically. He wrote poems, too.” From his hometown Malabon in Rizal Province, Mallari went to the Philippine Normal School in Manila, then he went as a government pensionado to the University of Wisconsin (USA) for further studies in English, Education and Library Science. For his accomplishments, Mallari was included in the Pan-Pacific Who’s Who and the Who’s Who library Science.

Ellwood Oil Field

Ellwood Oil Field (also spelled "Elwood")and South Ellwood Offshore Oil Field are a pair of adjacent, partially active oil fields adjoining the city of Goleta, California, about twelve miles (19 km) west of Santa Barbara, largely in the Santa Barbara Channel. A richly productive field in the 1930s, the Ellwood Oil Field was important to the economic development of the Santa Barbara area. A Japanese submarine shelled it during WWII, the first direct attack on the US mainland since the War of 1812, causing an invasion scare on the West Coast.
Setting.
The Ellwood Oil Field is located approximately west of the city of Santa Barbara, beginning at the western boundary of the city of Goleta, proceeding west into the Pacific and then back onshore near Dos Pueblos Ranch. The onshore portions of the field include beach, coastal bluffs, blufftop grasslands, and eucalyptus groves. Some of the former oil field is now part of the Ellwood-Devereux Open Space, maintained by the city of Goleta, and the Bacara Resort, Sandpiper Golf Course, and new Goleta housing developments sit on areas formerly occupied by pump-jacks, derricks, and oil storage tanks.
The climate is Mediterranean, with an equable temperature regime year-round, and most of the precipitation falling between October and April in the form of rain. Freezes are rare. Runoff is towards the ocean, and to a few vernal pools on the bluffs. The offshore portions of the Ellwood oil field are in relatively shallow water, and were drilled from piers.
The South Ellwood Offshore field is entirely beneath the Pacific Ocean, about two miles (3 km) from the main onshore oil field. It is entirely within the State Tidelands zone, which encompasses areas within three nautical miles (6 km) of shore. These regions are subject to state, rather than Federal regulation. Currently the only production from this field is from Platform Holly, which is in of water, about two miles (3 km) from the coast at Coal Oil Point. Numerous directionally-drilled oil wells originate at the platform, and several pipelines connect the platform to an onshore oil processing facility adjacent to the Sandpiper Golf Course.
Geology.
The Ellwood Oil Field is roughly five miles long and up to a mile wide, with both its eastern and western extremity onshore. It is an anticlinal structure, with oil trapped stratigraphically by the anticline. The More Ranch Fault provides an impermeable barrier on the northeast. Oil occurs in several pools, with the largest being in the Vaqueros Sandstone, approximately below ground surface. Other significant pools occur in the Rincon Formation at a depth of , and in the Upper Sespe Formation at below ground surface.
The Ellwood Oil Field contained approximately of oil, almost all of which has been removed, to the degree possible with the technology available until the early 1970s. The field now has been abandoned. The South Ellwood Offshore field, on the other hand, has been estimated by the US Department of Energy to hold over one billion barrels of oil and approximately by Venoco, Inc., most of which is in the undeveloped portion of the field. In 1995, the Oil and Gas Journal reported of proven reserves.
Oil from the Ellwood field was generally light and sweet, with an API gravity averaging 38 and low sulfur content (making it "sweet" in petroleum parlance). Oil from the offshore field is medium-grade, ranging from API gravity 25 to 34, and has a higher sulfur content, requiring more processing than the oil from the decommissioned onshore field.
Several pools have been identified in the South Ellwood Offshore field, in three major vertical zones. The upper Monterey Formation contains a large pool in a zone of fractured shale at an average depth of below the ocean floor. Beneath that, a separate pool exists in the Rincon Sand, below the ocean floor, and yet another in the Vaqueros Formation at a depth of . The deepest well drilled to date is into the Rincon Formation: age and strata information are still company-confidential to Venoco, the current operator.
History and production.
Ellwood Oil Field.
The field is named for Ellwood Cooper (1829-1918), who owned the large Ellwood Ranch in what is now Goleta and the adjacent hills. His first name lingers in several local place names including the oil fields, Ellwood Canyon, Ellwood School, Ellwood Station Road, and the Goleta neighborhood "Ellwood".
The first oil discovery in the area was in July, 1928, by Barnsdall Oil Co. of California and the Rio Grande Company, who drilled their Luton-Bell Well No. 1 to a depth of into the Vaqueros Sandstone. After almost giving up they not only struck oil, but had a significant gusher, initially producing . This discovery touched off a period of oil leasing and wildcat well drilling on the Santa Barbara south coast, from Carpinteria to Gaviota. During this period, the Mesa Oil Field was discovered, within the Santa Barbara city limits, about east of the Ellwood field.
World War II shelling.
A consequential visit by a foreigner occurred in the late 1930s. Kozo Nishino, the skipper of a Japanese oil tanker, visited the field to load up with oil. While walking with his crew to a formal welcoming ceremony onshore, he tripped and fell into a patch of prickly pear cactus (now below Fairway 11 of the Sandpiper Golf Course); the sight of the proud Japanese commander having cactus spines pulled from his buttocks provoked the laughter of a group of nearby oil workers.
Kozo came back a few years later, possibly for revenge. During the WWII, now captain of Japanese submarine I-17, he surfaced just off of Coal Oil Point on the evening of February 23, 1942, with his crew emerging to man the 5.5" deck gun of the sub. They fired between 16 and 25 rounds at a pair of oil storage tanks near the location where he had fallen into the cactus. His gunners were poor shots, and most of the shells went wild, exploding either miles inland on Tecolote Ranch or splashing in the water; one of the explosions damaged well Luton-Bell 17, on the beach just below Fairway 14 of the present-day golf course, causing about $500 in damage to a catwalk and some pumping equipment. Kozo radioed Tokyo that he had "left Santa Barbara in flames." This incident was the first direct attack by an enemy power on the US mainland since the War of 1812.
While peak production from the Ellwood field was in 1930, it continued to be productive through the 1960s; the onshore portion was abandoned in 1972.
Today the site of the oilfield equipment damaged by the Japanese is now Santa Barbara County property, which may be traversed by the public, on the beach below the Sandpiper Golf Course. A historical marker has been posted on a rock on the Golf Course grounds recounting the history of the incident.
South Ellwood Offshore field.
The existence of an offshore field was suspected for a long time, largely due to the persistent natural seepage of oil from the sea floor. The area around Coal Oil Point is now one of the most actively studied seep zones in the world. In 1966, ARCO built Platform Holly, in of water approximately two miles southwest of Coal Oil Point, and began drilling wells into the various zones in the South Ellwood Offshore field. Peak production from the field was in 1984. Mobil operated Platform Holly until 1997, at which point Venoco, Inc. acquired all rights to the field. Currently three pipelines – one oil, one gas, and one for utilities – connect the platform to the processing plant on the mainland. In addition, an oil pipeline transports oil from "tents" constructed over some of the natural seeps on the ocean floor to the processing plant.
Away from Platform Holly, much of the field is yet to be fully explored and developed. Mobil's 1995 proposal to drill from the shore (the "Clearview" project, dubbed "Drillview" by opponents) was rejected, and a proposal to drill into the more distant parts of the field from the existing Platform Holly is under consideration as of 2009. Venoco's current proposal involves directionally-drilling 40 new wells from the existing platform, potentially tripling its production.

Flaming Galah

Flaming Galah is Australian rock band Fraternity's second and final studio album, released in 1972. This album differs musically from their previous effort, "Livestock", which consisted mostly of a progressive and psychedelic sound. For "Flaming Galah", the band moved in a more blues/boogie rock direction.
They continued their progressive side however, with re-recordings of a number of tracks from "Livestock", such as "You Have a God", "Raglan's Folly", and "Canyon Suite" (known as "Grand Canyon Suites" on "Livestock"), and with the introduction of "Seasons of Change", a considerable amount of progressive rock is evident on the album. "Annabelle" is a reworking of "Cool Spot", from "Livestock".
Interviews with band members clarify the songwriting credits for those songs which were credited to the whole band on the album sleeve. John Bisset recalled "Welfare Boogie" as having been written by "Sam and possibly Bruce [Howe and Bon ", with "Hemming's Farm" being "mainly Sam's". Sam See has stated that he wrote "Hemming's Farm" himself, and co-wrote "Welfare Boogie" with Terry Wilkins from his previous band The Flying Circus. Bisset himself wrote "If You Got It".
Re-recordings.
Six out of the ten songs on "Flaming Galah" are re-recordings of older tracks: 
Unlike "Livestock", "Flaming Galah" has never had a CD reissue, although both this and the first album have been released as a two CD set including all the singles and other rarities released during Fraternity's career.

List of Ranma ½ episodes (season 1)

This article lists the episodes and short summaries of the original "Ranma ½" anime series, known in the English dub as the first season of "Ranma ½" or "Digital Dojo".
An anime adaptation of Rumiko Takahashi's manga series debuted on Fuji TV on April 15, 1989. It was canceled due to low ratings after only 18 episodes, with the last airing on September 16, 1989. However, the series was reworked by most of the same staff, retitled and debuted in December of that same year. It went on to become much more popular, lasting for 143 episodes.
Viz Media licensed both anime for English dubs and labeled them as one. They released them in North America in seven DVD collections they call "seasons". The first "Ranma ½" series is season 1, which was given the titled "Digital Dojo".
Episode 13 included a next episode preview to "The Abduction of P-Chan". However, "The Abduction of P-Chan" and the two following episodes that continue the story were not broadcast because of several kidnappings in Japan at the time. This causes a very slight plot hole in episode 15, which includes flashbacks to the then unaired episodes. They were later broadcast as "Ranma ½ Nettōhen" episodes 7-9. In the Blu-ray release, these three episodes are switched back to episodes 14-16 of the first anime, as originally planned.
The opening theme is "Don't Make Me Wild Like You", also known as by Etsuko Nishio. The first closing theme is by Kaori Sakagami, used in the first thirteen episodes. The second closing, CoCo's , is used in the final five episodes.

Malathi Krishnamurthy Holla

Malathi Krishnamurthy Holla (6 July 1958) is an International para athlete from India. She was awarded Arjuna award and Padma Shri for her achievements.
She was born on July 6, 1958 in Bangalore. Her father ran a small hotel, while her mother took care of their four children. A raging fever when she was one year old paralyzed Malathi's entire body. Electric shock treatment for more than two years saw little Malathi regaining strength in her upper body, but below the waist her body remained completely weak.
Notwithstanding the trials and turbulences that plagued her, Malathi decided to live life Queen Size, undaunted by the fury of fate. She chose sports as the best alternative medicine to forget her pain, and went on to become one of the most inspiring sports personalities of modern India.
With over 300 medals in her kitty, Malathi was conferred the prestigious Arjuna and Padma Shri Awards. She represented India in the Paralympics held in South Korea, Barcelona, Athens and Beijing; the Asian Games held in Beijing, Bangkok, South Korea and Kuala Lumpur; World Masters held in Denmark and Australia, Commonwealth Games in Australia and Open Championships in Belgium, Kuala Lumpur and England.
Her never-say-die attitude has been an eye-opener to many contemporary sports stars, who often refer to her as the Champion of Champions.
For the record, Malathi has so far undergone 32 surgeries.
Malathi works as a Manager with Syndicate Bank and shelters 16 children with various disabilities at Mathru Foundation — a charitable trust formed along with her friends. She focuses mainly on polio victims from rural areas, whose parents cannot afford to send their child to school or provide medical treatment.
Malathi Holla launched her first authorized biography A Different Spirit on July 8, 2009. Clearly, it was an evening that celebrated the triumph of the human spirit over physical handicap. 
“When I was small, I wanted to be first among my friends who used to run to the backyard to pick the fallen mangoes. I wanted to fly like a bird fearlessly from one place to another. But as I grew up I realised that you need legs to run and wings to fly. I was hurt, but I didn’t give up. I knew, one day, I would run…” says Malathi in the book.
“Thus I took up sports and decided to do something different in life. Yes, we are different and so even our lives should be a shining example of that difference,” she adds.

Georg-Wolfgang Feller

Wolfgang Feller (9 July 1915 – 23 March 1991) was an Oberleutnant zur See of the Reserves, in the German navy during World War II. He is noted for being the last soldier, sailor or serviceman to receive the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.
"Großadmiral" Karl Dönitz had ordered a cease of all promotions and awards as of 11 May 1945. Nevertheless a number of Knight's Crosses were awarded after this date and must therefore be considered "illegal" hand-outs. The "Oberbefehlshaber der Kriegsmarine" General-Admiral Walter Warzecha, successor of General-Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg, without authorization presented Georg-Wolfgang Feller the Knight's Cross on 17 June 1945.
Feller, group leader in the 36. Minensuchflottille, was awarded the Knight's Cross for clearing the eastern Baltic Sea from mines thus ensuring the safe passage of many returning German ships.

Delta High School (Muncie, Indiana)

Delta High School is a public high school located in Muncie, Indiana. The school serves about 800 students in grades 9 to 12.
As of 2012 the principal is Chris Conley.
History.
Delta High School was created in June 1967 when DeSoto, Eaton, and Royerton High Schools consolidated to form Delaware Metropolitan School District.
A committee of students from each school met to decide the school's name, colors, mascot, and to write the school's song.
Delta, was chosen for it was the Greek letter "D" which was written as
a triangle. The students felt that this symbol was appropriate for the three consolidated schools. The name Delta also contained the word Delaware which the students also felt was important to have in the name.
The Eagle mascot was also chosen following the Greek motif by choosing Zeus's symbol
of power and strength. Navy blue and gold were chosen for the school colors. An original school song written by Mary Jolliffe Kraack, 1968, was selected by the committee.
Albany High School joined the Delaware Metropolitan School District in 1968 and the school district's name was changed to Delaware Community School Corporation.
In 1968, the DARE Eagle was designed and became the official mascot for Delta because the students of Delta High School DARE to be outstanding in all areas. The letters in the word DARE were from the first letter in each of the four consolidated schools. D for DeSoto, A for Albany, R for Royerton, and E for Eaton.
The ground was broken for the new school building in March 1972. In September 1974 the new Delta High School was opened.
Delta High School was remodeled in 1992. It was once again remodeled in 2007 due to a mold problem.
It also had many structural issues (leaks in the ceilings, etc.) and mold problems circa 2004-2007, but recent remodeling has hopefully helped to remedy this issue.
Athletics.
Delta High School is a member of the IHSAA. The school's mascot is the Eagle and the school's colors are Navy Blue, Gold, and White.
Delta High School is part of the Hoosier Heritage Conference.
Their rivals are the Yorktown Tigers located in nearby Yorktown, Indiana.
Extracurricular activities.
Agriculture Department.
Delta High School is the only school that has an Agriculture Department in Delaware County. There are more than 200 students that participate in the Ag Department.
It includes classes such as Greenhouse, Ag Mechanics, Animal Science, Landscaping, Natural Resources, Small Engines, and Welding.
Agriculture Department teachers Matt Lyons and Nancy Kunk co-sponsor the FFA, which involves about 50 students. These students participate in National FFA week petting zoo, county fair young McDonalds Farm, Adopt a Highway, and Albany Halloween parade. FFA members also participate in contests such as soil judging, small engines, welding, Horse and Pony, Crops, Forestry, landscaping, mechanics, livestock, and dairy.
The Ag Department provides opportunities for students who want to be in agriculture-related careers the experience they need to go to college and other places. The department maintains its own greenhouse, which helps with the flowers and landscaping of the school.
Dual Credit Classes.
Delta High School offers 25 hours of dual credit classes. Dual credit classes are courses that give students a credit for both high school and college. The dual credit classes that will be offered in Fall 2008 are Anatomy 201, Biology 100, Math 165, Physics 110, English 103, History 150. In the Spring 2009, the classes will include Physics 112 and English 104.The college credits are for Ball State University, and the credits can be transferred to most other colleges in Indiana, with the exception of the University of Notre Dame and Wabash College. A typical college class is one semester long, but three of the dual classes (English 103 and 104, Physics 110 and 112, and History 150) actually follow that protocol. Others are full-year courses.
Student Publications.
The Eagle's Eye Magazine.
The Eagle's Eye newsmagazine is the Delta High School newspaper. It has a full-color cover and 28+ pages, including sections of color. The magazine includes stories on students and about topics that appeal to students. The staff makes 5 to 6 magazines a year. Delta is one of the only schools in East Central Indiana to produce a magazine. The Eagle's Eye staff also often writes the news for the school's webpage.
WWDS and Eagle Zone News.
WWDS is the name of the former radio station of Delta High School. It is now the name taken over by the television news crew that writes, produces, and performs its own news cast for the daily announcements. The station is currently advised by teacher Tim Cleland. The production group that works inside the studio is known as the Eagle Zone News team.
Towns.

Inman made his first-class debut in 1956, representing Ceylon against India at the P Saravanamuttu Stadium. Although Inman didn't make an impact with the bat, he claimed the wicket of opener Nari Contractor. He would go on to play another 254 first-class matches but it would remain his only wicket.
He made sporadic appearances for Ceylon in the Gopalan Trophy during the remainder of the decade before moving to England and joining his countryman Stanley Jayasinghe at Leicestershire. His first match for the English club came against the touring Australian side in 1961 and he contributed 30 and 45 not out. He had to wait until 1963 to make his Championship debut and scored his maiden first-class hundred against Cambridge in the University Match.
The left-hander spent over a decade at Leicestershire, having his most prolific season in 1968 when he managed 1735 runs at 36.91. Despite the high tally of runs he only scored one century that season. His conversion rate of 50s to 100s was average throughout his career and only in his final county season did he score four hundreds in a year. One of those came in his final ever first-class match, played against Northamptonshire at Grace Road.
Inman also played some List A cricket with Derbyshire in 1973.
Inman scored the fastest 50 in first class cricket, scoring 57 runs in 11 minutes of play.

Judo at the 2008 Summer Paralympics – Women's +70 kg

The women's +70 kg judo competition at the 2008 Summer Paralympics was held on September 9 at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium. Preliminary rounds started at 12:00 pm CST. Repechage finals, semifinals, bouts for bronze medals, and the final were held at 5:30 pm CST.
This event was the heaviest of the women's judo weight classes, allowing competitors with over 70 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.
A total of seven judokas competed in the event. An eighth competitor, Anayasi Hernandez of Cuba, was disqualified for failing a pre-match medical exam. Her first round bout against Zoubida Bouazoug of Algeria was canceled, and Bouazoug received a bye into the next round.

Li Baoyu

Li Baoyu (李抱玉) (703 – April 15, 777), né An Chongzhang (安重璋), known for some time as An Baoyu (安抱玉), formally Duke Zhaowu of Liang (涼昭武公), was a general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty. He was known for his contributions to Tang during the Anshi Rebellion and for his subsequent defense of the western border against Tufan.
Background.
An Chongzhang was born in 703, during the reign of Wu Zetian. His family was originally from Parthia but had lived for generations in the Hexi region, and his great-grandfather An Xinggui (安興貴) was a contributor to Tang Dynasty's establishment, having overthrown one of the contenders for supremacy during the transition from Sui to Tang, Li Gui the Emperor of Liang and united Li Gui's Liang state to Tang. The An family was known for its capability in tending horses, and a number of An family members moved to the region around the Tang capital Chang'an and became students of literature, having intermarried with scholar-bureaucratic families. An Chongzhang, however, grew up in the western regions and was capable in horsemanship and archery. He started serving in the military early in his life, and was said to be full of tactics, careful, and faithful. Toward the end of the "Tianbao" era (742–756) of Wu Zetian's grandson Emperor Xuanzong, for An Chongzhang's accomplishments in the army, Emperor Xuanzong bestowed on him a new name — Baoyu (meaning, "one who holds jade"). At the time that the general An Lushan rebelled at Fanyang (范陽, in modern Beijing) in 755 and soon established a new state of Yan, An Baoyu was defending Nanyang (南陽). When An Lushan sent messengers to try to persuade him to submit to Yan, he killed An Lushan's messengers.
During Emperor Suzong's reign.
In 756, Yan forces approached Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to flee to Chengdu. Emperor Xuanzong's son and crown prince Li Heng did not follow him to Chengdu, but instead fled to Lingwu, where he was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong) — an act that Emperor Xuanzong later recognized. One of the major generals that Emperor Suzong employed in the war against Yan was Li Guangbi, and Li Guangbi invited An Baoyu to serve under him. In 757, An Baoyu petitioned Emperor Suzong for a name change — stating, "Your subject has lived in Liang Prefecture for generations. I am ashamed to bear the same surname as the rebellious subject." Emperor Suzong granted him the imperial surname of Li, and also permitted him to change his designated home to Chang'an — considered a substantial honor at the time. He was also made the military governor ("Jiedushi") of Chenzheng Circuit (陳鄭, headquartered in modern Zhengzhou, Henan). Later in the year, when the new Yan emperor Shi Siming captured Luoyang (which, along with Chang'an, had been recaptured by Tang forces in 757), at Li Guangbi's request, Li Baoyu defended the southern fort at the important strategic position Heyang (河陽, near Luoyang) while Li Guangbi himself defended the central fort. Li Baoyu defended the southern fort despite an overwhelming Yan siege and eventually, Tang forces were able to stop the Yan advance. For Li Baoyu's contributions, he was created the Duke of Lecheng. In 761, however, when the eunuch official Yu Chao'en pressured Li Guangbi into trying to recapture Luoyang – which ended in spectacular failure — Li Baoyu was also forced to abandon Heyang and flee, apparently to Ze Prefecture (澤州, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi), for in 762, that was the location that Shi Siming's son and successor Shi Chaoyi put Li Baoyu under siege, which was lifted when the major general Guo Ziyi sent the Dingguo Army (定國軍) to aid him, allowing Li Baoyu to turn the tables on the Yan forces and defeat them.
During Emperor Daizong's reign.
Emperor Suzong died later in 762 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Daizong. Emperor Daizong made Li Baoyu, in addition to Chenzheng Circuit, the military governor of Zelu Circuit (澤潞, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), where Li Baoyu was at the time. He also wanted to create Li Baoyu the Prince of Wuwei, but Li Baoyu earnestly declined the princely title; instead, Emperor Daizong created him the Duke of Liang and gave him the honorific title of "Sikong" (司空) — one of the Three Excellencies. Later in 762, Li Baoyu participated in the joint Tang and Huige campaign to recapture Luoyang, and after Luoyang fell and Shi Chaoyi fled, a number of Yan generals submitted to Tang — but then were permitted to remain at their posts by the major Tang general Pugu Huai'en. Li Baoyu and another Tang general, Xin Yunjing (辛雲京), thus suspected Pugu of planning to rebel and warned Emperor Daizong of such. (Pugu was in fact fearful that the imperial government would no longer consider him important and therefore planned an alliance with these former Yan generals, and did eventually rebel in 763. His rebellion would not dissipate until his death in 765.)
In 763, Tufan forces made a surprise attack on Chang'an and captured it, forcing Emperor Daizong to flee to Shan Prefecture (陝州, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). Although Emperor Daizong was able to return to Chang'an soon thereafter, in the aftermaths, absconding Tang soldiers and local bandits grouped together in the five valleys to the south of Chang'an and engaged in banditry that Tang local governments were unable to deal with. Emperor Daizong initially put the official Xue Jingxian (薛景仙) in charge of suppressing the bandits, but Xue was unable to successfully do so even after several months. In 764, Emperor Daizong gave Li Baoyu the additional responsibility of being the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and put him in charge of the operations against the bandits. Li Baoyu used scouts to first discover the hidden headquarters of the bandits' leader Gao Yu (高玉) and was thereafter able to capture Gao by a surprise attack commanded by his subordinate Li Chongke (李崇客). It was said that within days, the banditry ceased. Also in 764, with another Tufan attack appearing to be looming, Emperor Daizong put Li Baoyu, along with Guo, in charge of defending against the Tufan forces. In light of Li Baoyu's being stationed at Fengxiang, Emperor Daizong made Li Baoyu's cousin Li Baozhen the deputy military governor of Zelu, and thereafter, while Li Baoyu was still titularly the military governor of Zelu, Li Baozhen was in actual command. In 765, when, near the end of Pugu's rebellion, a joint Huige and Tufan force that was intending to aid Pugu approached Chang'an, Li Baoyu was one of the generals who were summoned to defend Chang'an. (After Pugu died of illness around that time, Guo was able to persuade Huige forces to withdraw, and once Huige forces did so, so did Tufan forces.)
In 767, Li Baoyu went to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Daizong. He offered to resign one of his honorary titles — "Zuo Pushe" (左僕射, which, if not honorary, would be one of the heads of the executive bureau of government (尚書省, "Shangshu Sheng")). Emperor Daizong agreed, although when Li Baoyu then also offered to resign the command of Fengxiang Circuit, Emperor Daizong refused.
In 770, as part of Emperor Daizong's plot with the chancellor Yuan Zai to kill Yu Chao'en, who had by then become overbearingly powerful, Yuan's ally Huangfu Wen (皇甫溫) was moved from Shan Circuit (headquartered in modern Sanmenxia) to Fengxiang, while Li Baoyu was moved from Fengxiang to Shannan West Circuit (山南西道, headquartered in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi, to the southwest of Chang'an). When Li Baoyu was embarking from Fengxiang, heading for Shannan West's capital Zhouzhi (盩厔), it was said that his soldiers were so angry about the movement that they pillaged Fengxiang for several days. After Emperor Daizong and Yuan killed Yu soon thereafter, Huangfu was moved back to Shan and it appeared that Fengxiang was given back to Li Baoyu. Later in the year, when Ma Lin (馬璘) the military governor of Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu) complained that his circuit was too poor to support his army, Emperor Daizong hinted to Li Baoyu that he should yield two prefectures out of his command — Zheng Prefecture (鄭州, in modern Zhengzhou) and Ying Prefecture (潁州, in modern Xuchang, Henan) — and Li Baoyu did so; those prefectures were thereafter transferred to Ma.
In 771, Li Baoyu submitted a petition to Emperor Daizong, asking for part of his responsibility area to be given to another general — pointing out that given how much of the Tufan frontier was in his responsibility area, if Tufan attacked multiple places, he would not be able to defend against all of the Tufan attacks. He offered to yield the command of Shannan West. Emperor Daizong was appreciative of Li Baoyu's willingness to yield, and agreed to do so, although there was no subsequent records of Emperor Daizong giving Shannan West to another general. In 775, when Tufan made further incursions, Li Baoyu defended against the attack. He died in 777. He was much mourned by Emperor Daizong and given posthumous honors.
Li Baoyu's biography in the "Book of Tang" contained this commentary about him:

<doc id="19297714" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19297714" title="Splash dam">
Splash dam

A splash dam was a temporary wooden dam used to raise the water level in streams to float logs downstream to sawmills. By impounding water and allowing it to be released on the log drive's schedule, these dams allowed many more logs to be brought to market than the natural flow of the creek allowed. Water releases from multiple splash dams on tributaries were also often combined to maximize the number of logs floated throughout a given watershed.
Construction.
Splash dams were typically constructed of logs or boards, which formed cribs that were then filled with stones and earth. They could be anywhere from to several hundred feet wide, and were used from one to several years. A splash dam had to be sited on a section of the stream that allowed as large a body of water to accumulate behind the dam as possible. Behind the dam logs were transported to the creek and its banks, often along log slides. 
The splash dam was equipped with a chute to allow water and logs to escape. When the chute was closed, water collected behind the dam. Construction work also extended to the stream below the splash dam, which had to be cleared of obstacles and often had its banks cleared for some distance above the waterline. This was an effort to prevent as many logs as possible from becoming stuck on the banks of the creek. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a law on March 28, 1871 allowing splash dam construction and clearing of creeks to allow loose logs to float better.
Use.
Originally lumber was only floated downstream using seasonal high water, typically in spring following snowmelt. Loggers found that by constructing a dam to impound water they could control the level of water and float more logs, which improved conditions for log drivers. In addition to the annual early spring log drive in March, splash dams frequently allowed smaller drives anytime there was sufficient water: in Pennsylvania rains could lead to drives in May or June, and small drives in September or October were also possible. 
To give some idea of the scale of the log drives, Pennsylvania's Pine Creek, the largest tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River, had produced rafts of pine spars for decades, ending in 1865. The earliest spring log drives there floated up to of logs in the creek at one time. In 1908, a single splash dam in northcentral Pennsylvania floated in one log drive.
Log drives lasted four to six days in northern Pennsylvania. A series of arks, boats specially built for the drive, floated down the creek behind the logs. Typically one boat was the kitchen and dining area, one served as sleeping quarters for the men, and one provided shelter for the horses. The men and horses worked in the creek all day getting logs stranded on the banks back in the water. Log jams were a problem as well and required careful removal of one or more key logs to break the jam and allow the logs to again flow freely. Breaking a logjam might involve one or more men working with hand tools, or it might involve explosives.
By impounding water and allowing it to be released on the log drive's schedule, these dams allowed many more logs to be brought to market than the natural flow of the creek allowed. Water releases from multiple splash dams on tributaries were also often combined to maximize the number of logs floated throughout a given watershed. On the Red River in eastern Kentucky, a series of carefully timed releases of water from splash dams allowed log drives to travel downstream. These drives had between 35,000 and 50,000 logs in them and one produced a log jam long.
Legacy.
Splash dams operated across the United States, from about 1860 to 1930. As of 2008, the United States Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System shows thirteen place names in the United States containing the words "splash dam". Pennsylvania has the most, with eight places, but there are also places in Kentucky, Utah, and Idaho named "Splash Dam". Two Pennsylvania state parks, Parker Dam State Park and McCalls Dam State Park, are named for splash dams.

2008 Shanxi mudslide

The 2008 Shanxi mudslide was caused by the collapse of an unlicensed mine landfill in Xiangfen county, Linfen, Shanxi Province, People's Republic of China which caused 277 dead, 4 missing and 33 injured. Around 8:00 a.m. on September 8, 2008, the retaining wall of a waste iron ore reservoir collapsed after torrential rain, causing a major mudslide which inundated a village and crowded marketplace. The unlicensed Tashan Mine was operated by the Tashan Mining Company.
History.
The ore reservoir was built in the 1980s, halfway up a mountain, about 50 meters above an office building, marketplace and some residences. It was built only 100 meters away from the nearest residence. The reservoir was supposedly decommissioned a few years later, but its new owner, Zhang Peiliang, put it back into use when he took over the company in 2005. In 2006, the Tashan Mining Company did not renew its safety production license, and in 2007, the mining license of Zhang also expired.
Damages and casualties.
The entire village of Yunhe was inundated by the mudslide, including an outdoor market crowded with customers. As of September 24, the Chinese state media reported that the death toll was 267, and the number of injuries 34. Only 128 bodies, mostly of locals, have been identified. Some 268,000 cubic meters of mudslide sludge flooded over an area of 30.2 hectares in the disaster, and the mud was up to six meters deep in some parts.
The final official count is: 277 dead, 4 missing and 33 injured.
A worker had said "It's not because of the rain. It wasn't a natural disaster, it was man-made." Up to 500 people may still be buried, according to the Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy.
Rescue efforts.
5,300 police and rescuers, using more than 110 excavators, were looking for survivors. The rescuers covered about 90% of the mudslide zone so far. In addition, 2,100 medical workers were at the site to provide medical care.
Aftermath.
1,047 people are displaced because of the mudslide. The provincial level government says relatives of the dead will receive 200,000 yuan (US$ 29,215). The Communist Party chief, the head of Taosi township, work safety bureau director, and chief engineer in Xiangfen county were dismissed for neglect of duty. Thirteen mine executives, including Zhang Peiliang, were detained by Chinese authorities, and four other local officials were also dismissed. The State Administration of Work Safety (SAWS) said that an investigation is pending, and that the people responsible will be "punished in line with the relevant laws." Wang Jun, the director of SAWS said, "It is the most grave accident that involves the largest death toll so far this year. The rising accidents disclose local governments' poor supervision on work safety. Those responsible must be dealt with seriously." Meng Xuenong, Governor of Shanxi, resigned a day after the event, on September 14. Wang Jun was subsequently transferred to become Governor of Shanxi.
In September 2010, 58 people, including 34 former government officials, were handed out sentences in relation to the collapse.

Leucopaxillus gentianeus is a bitter-tasting, inedible mushroom commonly known as the bitter false funnelcap, or the bitter brown leucopaxillus. A common synonym is "Leucopaxillus amarus". The bitter taste is caused by a triterpene called cucurbitacin B. The species was first described in 1873 as "Clitocybe gentianea" by French mycologist Lucien Quélet. František Kotlaba transferred it to "Leucopaxillus" in 1966.

J. Leonard Lackman House

The J. Leonard Lackman House is located on Imperial Avenue in Cohoes, New York, United States. Lackman was a local gunsmith and locksmith. His descendants still own and reside in the house as of 2009.
It was built in the late 19th century in the then-popular Queen Anne architectural style. In 1998 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
Building.
The house is a two-story, two-bay wood frame dwelling on a stone foundation. The first story is sided in clapboard; the second in imbricate shingle, flaring out at the floor line slightly. Both are currently painted different colors. The roof is steeply pitched and gabled.
The mass of the house is broken up on every side in different ways, most noticeably at the front. The facade there, facing the street to the west, features the entrance's double wooden doors inside an enclosed porch on the north bay. It in turn has a pedimented roof. Above it rises a small turret with a window in the chamfered north and west and columns that rise to support a steep conical spirelet. To the south of the porch is a large, projecting bay window. This is topped with an overhanging bay on the second story and then the overhanging gabled dormer above it, bracketed by carved swags.
On the north, the profile is broken by a projecting bay as well, on both stories, supporting another gable with carved swag brackets. A nearby stair bay is lit by a round-topped stained glass window. The south elevation features an enclosed brick porch with corbeled columns supporting a frieze at the flared roofline. Another porch, this time wooden, is on the east (rear) facade, which offers a view over downtown Cohoes and the Hudson River.
The interior has seen little change. Many of its decorative features survive, such as the wall plaster, door surrounds, architraves, patterned metal ceilings and mantels. The entry hall, its newel-posted stairway lit by the stained-glass window on the north profile, has an inlaid parquet floor, delicate fireplace and mantel.

Major John Ingles Gilmour DSO MC & Two Bars (28 June 1896 – 24 February 1928) was a World War I flying ace. He was the highest scoring Scotsman in the Royal Flying Corps, with 39 victories.
Early life.
Gilmour was born in Helensburgh, Dumbartonshire, Scotland. He began his military career as an officer in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Regiment.
Flying Service.
Gilmour joined the Royal Flying Corps in December 1915. He was originally assigned to 27 Squadron of the RFC. They were the sole squadron equipped with the Martinsyde G.100, commonly called the Elephant. This craft was nicknamed for being large and ungainly. A single seated aircraft, it turned out to be too big, slow, and unmaneuverable to be a successful fighter, and without a rear gunner, too defenseless to survive well in a ground attack or bombing role. It was equipped with a Lewis machine gun mounted on the upper wing firing over the propeller arc, and a second one on the fuselage pointed toward the rear. 
Nevertheless, before the Elephants were withdrawn from service, Gilmour scored three victories flying one, though his primary duty was bombing. On 15 September 1916, in conjunction with several other pilots, he destroyed an Albatros D.I. On the 24th, he destroyed a Fokker Eindekker; on the 26th, he drove another down out of control.
On 26 May 1917, Lieutenant Gilmour received the Military Cross for his prowess as a bombing formation leader. At this point, he was almost certainly still flying the Martinsyde.
Late in 1917, Gilmour was assigned to No. 65 Squadron RAF as a flight commander. After a fourteen month gap in his aerial victory list, he scored flying a Sopwith Camel, on 18 December 1917. His two triumphs that day made him an ace.
He shot a triple on 4 January 1918, including one down in flames, and followed it up with number eight on 9 January.
He then began to run up his score by single and double victories—two in February, one in March, seven in April, eight in May, four in June. By 29 June, his total was 31.
On 1 July 1918, Gilmour capped his career with a performance that earned him a Distinguished Service Order. On that evening, in a 45 minute span, he burned two Fokker D.VIIs and knocked another down out of control, set an Albatros D.V afire, and drove a Pfalz D.III out of the air. The times on his combat reports make it clear these were five separate engagements; many times, aces reporting multiple victories scored in a single engagement.
Gilmour destroyed a Pfalz the next day, and two the day after, for his final successes. In the end, his victory record showed that he had 1 balloon destroyed, 1 enemy aircraft captured, 24 aircraft destroyed (and 3 shared destroyed) and 10 claimed 'out of control'. Eight of the destroyed craft had gone down in flames, as had the balloon. 
He was promoted to major and transferred to Italy to command 28 Squadron. However, he did not add further victories to his record.
His victory list made him the leading ace of the 13 aces in 65 Squadron.
On 3 August 1918, Gilmour was awarded the DSO; on 16 September, he was gazetted for his second bar to his MC.
After the war, he had a brief tenure as air attaché in Rome in July, 1919. He then transferred to the Middle East to join a former Royal Naval Air Service unit, No. 216 Squadron RAF. 
John Inglis Gilmour died on 24 February 1928, having committed suicide by cyanide poisoning. His death certificate describes him as of being of independent means but unsound mind.

E. O. Excell

Edwin Othello Excell (December 13, 1851 – June 10, 1921), commonly known as E. O. Excell, was a prominent American publisher, composer, song leader, and singer of music for church, Sunday school, and evangelistic meetings during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Some of the significant collaborators in his vocal and publishing work included Sam P. Jones, William E. Biederwolf, Gipsy Smith, Charles Reign Scoville, J. Wilbur Chapman, W. E. M. Hackleman, Charles H. Gabriel and D. B. Towner.
His 1909 stanza selection and arrangement of "Amazing Grace" became the most widely used and familiar setting of that hymn by the second half of the twentieth century. The influence of his sacred music on American popular culture through revival meetings, religious conventions, circuit chautauquas, and church hymnals was substantial enough by the 1920s to garner a satirical reference by Sinclair Lewis in the novel "Elmer Gantry".
Excell compiled or contributed to about ninety secular and sacred song books and is estimated to have written, composed, or arranged more than two thousand of the songs he published. The music publishing business he started in 1881 and that eventually bore his name was the highest volume producer of hymnbooks in America at the time of his death.
Early years.
Excell was the son of German Reformed minister and self-published author J. J. Excell. He was born in Uniontown, Stark County, Ohio and attended public schools in Ohio and Pennsylvania. After marrying in 1871 near Brady's Bend, Pennsylvania, he relocated to that state and supported his family for several years as a plasterer, bricklayer, and singing instructor. His focus was turned to sacred music through his experience leading songs at revivals and worship services of Methodist Episcopal churches, first in East Brady and then, starting in 1881, Oil City, Pennsylvania. Between 1877 and 1883 he studied music formally at the Normal Musical Institutes of George F. Root where he also received vocal training under Root's son, Frederick. He moved to Chicago, base of Root's operations, in 1883 to pursue music publishing in earnest.
Vocalist and song leader.
Excell was described as "a big, robust six-footer, with a six-in caliber voice" and extraordinary range that enabled him to solo as baritone or tenor. Publisher George H. Doran observed him leading songs at a revival and later noted that Excell "was a master of mass control; he might easily have become conductor of some mighty chorus". These talents fostered his early success as a rural singing teacher in Pennsylvania and helped secure a position as church choirmaster for the two years preceding his move to Illinois.
Two important contacts made during his early years in Chicago were Benjamin F. Jacobs and John H. Vincent. Both men had been heavily involved with the uniform Sunday school lesson system established among many Protestant denominations during the early 1870s. Vincent was also co-founder of the original Chautauqua Assembly and involved with the burgeoning church youth movements of the era, such as Christian Endeavor and Epworth Leagues. Excell assisted with the music of their Sunday school work for at least two years and later served as music editor for correspondence courses Vincent established through the Chautauqua Press. He also performed as a vocalist for programs at the Chautauqua Institution. Insights gained from these associations were significant in that much of what Excell would later publish targeted Sunday school and youth program music needs.
The Methodist Episcopal church of Excell's day was still divided into northern and southern denominations created by an antebellum split. Excell and Vincent were affiliated with the northern branch known as the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1885 he met Sam P. Jones, a Georgia evangelist of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and was invited to join him as vocalist the following year, which included a campaign in Toronto during October, 1886.
Jones' musical director at that time was Marcellus J. Maxwell of Oxford, Georgia. He was also a capable singer and songwriter, though more reserved than Excell. They became an effective musical team known informally as "Ex and Max". At some point prior to 1895, Excell became the principal song leader and vocalist Jones referred to as "this big-hearted, noble soul ..., my chorister, Brother Excell." The respect was mutual and good natured. In 1887 Excell wrote and published a spiritualized rendition of "one of the trite sayings of the Reverend Sam P. Jones" titled "You Better Quit Your Meanness". It was dedicated to Jones by "his Co-Worker, E. O. Excell". They worked together throughout the United States and Canada until Jones' death in 1906. Though their twenty-year partnership was not exclusive, it was one of the most significant influences on Excell's career.
While serving as Jones' chorister, Excell became adept at crafting large volunteer choirs out of recruits from multiple local churches that had never sung together before. These combined revival and evangelistic meeting choirs typically had fewer than 400 participants. However, William Shaw of Christian Endeavor listed Excell among Ira Sankey, Homer Rodeheaver, and other distinguished musicians who had led choirs in the range of one thousand to four thousand voices at their conventions.
Excell assisted a number of other evangelists and religious conference leaders in various musical capacities. He worked as a vocalist for William E. Biederwolf, a Presbyterian minister active with the Winona Lake Bible Conference and its related chautauqua, with whom he also collaborated on a number of hymnbooks. During the final decade of his life he assisted with the music program of British evangelist Gipsy Smith.
Music publisher, compiler and editor.
Excell compiled a collection of hymns and gospel songs around 1880 which was published as "Sacred Echoes" by John J. Hood of Philadelphia in 1881, the year he marked as his start in the business. "Sing the Gospel", published around the time of the move to Chicago, was issued under the "E. O. Excell" imprint. "Echoes of Eden" followed two years later in 1884. An archetype of later "combined" song books was produced in 1885 when contents of "Sing the Gospel", "Echoes of Eden" and limited new material were repackaged into "The Gospel in Song", a hymnbook later advertised to contain the songs and solos sung by Excell at Sam Jones' Gospel meetings.
Sam Jones Influence.
The working relationship initiated with Jones in 1886 proved to be a pattern of the age. A contemporary writer explained that prominent evangelists always "had their leading singers, they were billed on the hoardings of the cities after the manner of theatrical companies -- Moody and Sankey; Sam Jones and Excell; Chapman and Alexander; Torrey and Towner; and so on." The promotional benefit for a sacred music publisher was enormous. Excell's books were used in Jones' revivals and the contents revised over time to suit changing preferences and the needs of the campaigns.
Three song books aimed at different applications were published in 1886 and 1887. All three became series that ran through most of the years Excell was affiliated with Jones' ministry:
"Make His Praise Glorious", published in 1900 as the "Triumphant Songs" series was approaching its end, contained Excell's initial arrangement of "Amazing Grace" based upon the tune "New Britain". He compiled and published at least another six song books with the E. O. Excell imprint during his final years with Jones. Excell and his song books received significant exposure in the majority of U.S. states and Canadian provinces of his day during the twenty years they worked together.
Collaborations.
Only about seven new song books were published by Excell under his own imprint in the years following Jones' death, though the annual quantity of books sold still managed to more than double during that time. The business changed to involve a greater number of collaborations destined for other publishers and private label printing of denominational hymnals. Some of the most substantial were:
The portfolios of copyrights for contemporary songs and plates for classic hymns that Excell accumulated as a publisher and composer also led to printing work on denominational hymnals. He produced the 1909 edition of "Spiritual Hymns of Brethren in Christ" in which he held copyrights for about one third of the six hundred songs selected by the hymnal committee. Another example was the original edition of "Great Songs of the Church" which he produced for the Churches of Christ in 1921.
E. O. Excell Company.
Excell developed approximately fifty song books and contributed to at least another thirty-eight over his forty-year publishing career. By 1914, his company had produced close to 10 million books and was selling them at a rate of nearly a half million per year. Annual output had grown to more than a million books by 1921, though with margins at wholesale levels.
Excell's only child, William Alonzo, participated in both the musical event and publishing businesses. At least one publication, "Chorus Choir Selections" (1918), bore the "E. O. Excell & Son" imprint. "E. O. Excell Company" was utilized on publications created after the founder's death. Excell's grandson, known as E. O. Excell, Jr, was also engaged in the family publishing business by 1927.
Lyricist, composer and arranger.
Estimates of the number of songs authored, composed, or arranged by Excell range from two to three thousand. Two that remain well known are his 1909 arrangement of John Newton's "Amazing Grace" and the tune he composed for Johnson Oatman's "Count Your Blessings".
Death and legacy.
Excell fell ill while assisting Gipsy Smith with a revival in Louisville, Kentucky and returned to Chicago to be hospitalized. He died on June 10, 1921 after more than thirty weeks in Wesley Memorial Hospital. Colleagues at the International Sunday School Association, where he had served for thirty-six years, said the following of him at their next convention:
At least five books listing him as a contributor were published posthumously. One of these was "The Excell Hymnal" published by his company in 1925; it was completed by his long-time collaborators Hamp Sewell and W. E. M. Hackleman as "a fitting climax to its long line of illustrious predecessors".
Heirs sold the large E. O. Excell Company copyright portfolio to the Hope Publishing Company in 1931 which they combined with their prior acquisition of a former Ira Sankey firm to create the Biglow-Main-Excell Company. The most popular Excell compositions at the time of the sale were "I'll Be a Sunbeam" and "Count Your Blessings".

Baotu Spring

The Baotu Spring (, sometimes translated 
as "Jet Spring" or "Spurting Spring") is a culturally significant artesian karst spring located in the city of Jinan, Shandong Province, China. It is 
mentioned in the Spring and Autumn Annals, one of the Five Classics of Chinese literature and was declared the "Number One Spring under the Heaven" () 
by the Qing Dynasty Emperor Qian Long.
Baotu Spring.
The Baotu Spring is the most renown among the more than 70 named 
artesian springs in the downtown area of the city of Jinan. The water 
of all these springs originates from an Ordovician 
karst aquifer under the city. As the terrain around Jinan slopes from 
the south down to the north, the recharge area for the aquifer is 
located in the mountainous area to the south of the city. The recharge 
area of the springs covers 1,500 square kilometres, out of which 550 
km2 provide direct recharge and 950 km2 indirect recharge. 
Altogether, the springs fed by the aquifer have a discharge of about 
300,000-350,000 cubic metres per day. Since the 
1970s, the springs have stopped flowing several times because too much 
water has been taken out from the aquifer for human consumption (more 
than 270,000 m3 per day in the 1970s). 
The Baotu Spring is part of a cluster of about 20 named springs. Water age 
estimates suggest that its water originates from shallow circulation. 
The spring pool of the Baotu spring is fed by an underwater limestone 
water through three outlets, the volume of the water coming out of the 
spring can reach peak values up to 1.6 cubic metres per second. The water jets from the spring are said to have reached highs up to 26 metres. The water temperature remains constant of 18 degree Celsius through the entire 
year.
Other springs in the Baotu Group.
Among the other springs in the Baotu group that are also on the list of the "seventy-two famous springs" () in Jinan are:
History.
The existence of the Baotu Spring has been dated back more than 3,500 
years to the times of the Shang Dynasty. The spring is 
mentioned in the Spring and Autumn Annals, the official chronicle 
of the ancient State of Lu and one of the Five Classics of 
Chinese literature. The Baotu Spring is also described in the Shuijing Zhu ("Commentary on the Waterways Classic") 
compiled by the geographer Li Daoyuan during the time of the 
Northern Wei Dynasty. He writes that "spring gushes up, water 
gushing like wheel".
During the time of Li Daoyuan, the Baotu Spring and adjacent springs formed the source of
the ancient Luo River.
The present-day name of the spring refers to the gushing up of the water. It dates back to the Song Dynasty; 
previously the spring had been known under different names such as 
"Baoliu" and "Lanquan".
The area of the Baotu Spring as well as some neighboring springs in the same group are protected by a public park 
(). The park was created in 1956
and covers now about 10.5 hectares.
Architecture.
The spring water feeds into a rectangular spring pool that extends 30 
meters from east to west and 18 meters from north to south. The spring 
pool is surrounded by historical structures such as the Leyuan (or Luoyuan) Hall 
(Song Dynasty, to the north of the spring), the Guanlan Pavilion 
(Ming Dynasty, west of the spring), and the Laihe Bridge (built during the Wanli era of the Ming Dynasty, east of the spring). Close by, on the shore of the spring's runoff stands the Wangheting Teahouse. Other noteworthy structures are the Banbi Corridor and the Waterside Chamber. The largest architectural ensemble is the 10,000 Bamboo Garden (). It comprises 186 buildings arranged around 13 courtyards as well as four pavilions and five bridges. Originally built during the Yuan Dynasty, it served as the residence of the governor of Shandong during the Ming Dynasty. Later, it was the home of the poet Wang Ping, who purchased it during the Qing Dynasty in 1692. In 1912, Zhang Hauizhi, a commander of the local army who later became governor of Shandong Province bought the garden and kept enlarging it from 1912 to 1927. Other gardens and architectural ensembles within the park are the Cang Garden (with the memorial to Wang Xuetao), the Luoyuan Garden, the Hundred Flowers Garden, and the (May 3rd Massacre) Memorial Garden.
Culture.
Baotu Spring has been a recurring subject of classic Chinese 
literature and has been written about by authors such as Zeng Gong 
(Song Dynasty), Zhao Mengfu (Yuan Dynasty), and Pu Songling (Qing Dynasty). The spring was visited by the emperors Kang Xi and Qian Long who left inscriptions at the 
site. Qian Long conferred on it the honorary title "First Spring under 
the Heaven" (). 
The Baotu Spring public park also houses memorials to the local painters 
Li Kuchan (1898–1983) and Wang Xuetao (1903–1982) as well as 
to the poet Li Qingzhao. The latter has a memorial hall set in a traditional 
courtyard dedicated to her.
The Baotu Spring is the site of an annual lantern festival (starts on the Chinese New Year day and lasts for one month, and a chrysanthemum show (since the 1970s, held from the end of October to the end of November. 
A local beer brand ("Baotu Quan" beer produced by Jinan Beer Group Corporation) 
is named after the spring and said to be brewed with water from the 
spring.
Location.
The Baotu Spring is located right to the southwest of the city center of Jinan, on the outer side of the old city moat and near the west end of Quancheng Road (); its street address is Baotu Spring South Road 1 (), Jinan, Shandong.

Salv'a lo vescovo senato

"Salv'a lo vescovo senato", also known as the "Cantilena giullaresca", because it was written for performance by a jongleur, or "Ritmo laurenziano", because it was found in a codex (Santa Croce XV, IV) of the Biblioteca Mediceo Laurenziana in Florence, is a lyric poem in the Tuscan language. It was probably composed in the third quarter of the twelfth century (1150–71) by a Tuscan poet. It is the earliest surviving piece of poetry in an unmistakably Italian dialect. 
"Salv'a lo vescovo senato" comprises twenty monorhyming "ottonari". In the same manuscript is found a martyrology. Two internal references in the poem constrain its dating: a mention of Galgano Inghirami, Bishop of Volterra from 1150 to 1157, and of Grimaldo, Bishop of Osimo from 1151 to 1157. Bruno Migliorini describes the poem:
"Il giullare si rivolge a un vescovo (Villano, arcivescovo di Pisa, secondo l'ipotesi del Cesareo, accolta dal Mazzoni) facendone lodi sperticate e pronosticandogli nientemeno che il pontificato, con la speranza di ottenere in dono un cavallo: se lo ottiene, lo mostrerà al vescovo di Volterra, Galgano".<br>
The jongleur addresses a bishop (Villano, Archbishop of Pisa, according to the hypothesis of Cesareo, following Mazzoni) making drawn-out praises and go so far as to predict for him a pontificate, in the hopes of obtaining a horse: if he obtains it, he will show it to the bishop of Volterra, Galgano.

Spanish Formosa

Spanish Formosa was a Spanish colony established in the north of Taiwan from 1626 to 1642.
The Portuguese were the first Europeans to discover the island of Taiwan, and named it "Formosa" due to the beautiful landscape as seen from the sea. When Spain and Portugal formed the Iberian Union, some of their respective colonies changed possession and some Portuguese expeditions were in the service of the Spanish Emperor. This included Portuguese Formosa, which was controlled by the Iberian Union from 1626 to 1642. The colony was meant to protect Spanish and Portuguese trade in the region from interference by the Dutch base in the south of Taiwan. The Spanish colony was short-lived due to the unwillingness of Spanish colonial authorities in Manila to commit men and materiel to defending it.
After seventeen years, the last fortress of the Spanish was besieged by Dutch forces and eventually fell, giving the Dutch control over most of the island.
Background.
In 1566, the Dutch revolt against Phillip II erupted. The Dutch Republic and its allies, England and France invaded and looted many of Phillip II's overseas territories as part of the Eighty Years War. Brazil was partially conquered by both France and the Seventeen Provinces.
As a result of the Iberian Union in 1580, Portugal and its Empire was ruled by the Spanish Habsburg Philip II of Spain, and the Spain's enemies became Portugal's as well, the Dutch of the Seventeen Provinces in Dutch–Portuguese War, as well as their allies England and France. Portugal and its overseas territories had become part of the king possessions due to some unexpected events in North Africa leading to the death without heirs of Sebastian I of Portugal.
Emperor Philip II cut the Dutch off from the spices and the markets in Lisbon, making it necessary for the Dutch to send their own expeditions to the sources of these commodities to take control of the spice trade in the Indies.
The Dutch colonization of Formosa was part of a campaign designed to seize all the possessions of Philip II in Asia, including Formosa and the Philippines. The Dutch began to take the string of coastal fortresses that comprised Phillip II's Asian possessions. The settlements were isolated, difficult to reinforce if attacked, and prone to being picked off one by one, but nevertheless the Dutch only enjoyed mixed success in its attempts to take them.
Pursuing their quest for alternative routes to Asia for trade, the first Dutch squadron to reach the Philippines on December 14, 1600 was led by Olivier van Noort. The Dutch sought to dominate the commercial sea trade in Southeast Asia, even engaging in privateering. They disrupted trade by harassing the coasts of Manila bay and its environs, and preyed on sampans and junks from China and Japan trading at Manila. The Battles of La Naval de Manila were five naval battles fought in the waters off the Philippines in 1646, between the forces of Spain and the Dutch Republic, during the Eighty Years’ War.
War with the Dutch led to invasions of many of Phillip II's possessions in Asia, including Formosa, Ceylon, the Philippines, and commercial interests in Japan, Africa (Mina), and South America. Even though the Portuguese were unable to capture the entire island of Ceylon, the Dutch were able to keep the coastal regions of Ceylon under their control for a considerable amount of time.
Catholic Phillip II was in competition with Protestant Holland for trade and influence in East Asia. With the establishment of a Dutch colony at Tayouan, present-day Anping, in the south of Taiwan, the Dutch were able to threaten Spain's trade in the region. As a counter to this threat, the Spanish decided to establish their own colony in the north of the island.
The early years (1626–1629).
Landing at Cape Santiago (now Sandiao) in the north-east of Taiwan but finding it unsuitable for defensive purposes, the Spanish continued westwards along the coast until they arrived at Keelung. A deep and well-protected harbour plus a small island in the mouth of the harbour made it the ideal spot to build the first settlement, which they named Santissima Trinidad. Forts were built, both on the island and in the harbour itself.
In 1629 the Spanish set up their second base, centred around Fort San Domingo in Tamsui.
First battle with the Dutch.
In 1641, the Spanish had become such an irritant to the Dutch in the south that it was decided to take northern Taiwan from the Spanish by force. In courteous terms, the Dutch Governor Paulus Traudenius informed the Spanish governor of their intentions.
The Spanish governor was not inclined to give in so easily, and replied in kind.
Subsequently the Dutch launched an assault on the northern regions held by the Spanish, but the positions were well-defended and the attacking troops were not able to breach the walls of the fortresses. They returned, thwarted and humiliated, to the Dutch base at Fort Zeelandia.
Final Battle with the Dutch.
In August 1642, The Dutch returned to Jilong with four large ships, several smaller ships, and approximately 369 Dutch soldiers. A combination of Spaniards, aboriginals, and Pampangos from the Philippines held off the Dutch for six days. They eventually surrendered and were returned to Manila defeated, and giving up their flags and what little artillery remained with them. Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera, governor of the Philippines, was blamed for the loss of Formosa and was eventually tried in court for his actions. Upon conviction, he was imprisoned for five years in the Philippines. Historians since Corcuera's time have chastised him for the loss of the Formosa.

William Pattenden (born 31 October 1747 at East Peckham, Kent; died 1817 at Hadlow and buried 2 April 1817 at East Peckham) was an English professional cricketer who played for Kent. He made 7 known appearances in first-class matches. He was the younger brother of Thomas Pattenden.
He played alongside his brother in a number of Kent teams from 1777 to 1781. He may have played for Kent v Surrey in 1773 for in one account the Pattenden was William and in another it was Thomas. This is a good example of the confusion caused when initials or first names are left out of the scorecards. The same applies to various Woods, Mays, Rimmingtons, Whites, etc.

Manuel Durán y Bas

Manuel Durán y Bas (29 November 1823, Barcelona – 10 February 1907, Barcelona) was one of the leading Spanish jurists of his generation and served as Spanish Minister of Justice in 1899.
Life.
Durán y Bas graduated with a doctorate in law from the University of Barcelona in 1852, was appointed to the chair of commercial law there in 1862 and served as the university's rector in 1896. As a renowned advocate, he represented the interests of the preeminent Catalan families and served on the boards of many academic and commercial institutions.
In 1863, Durán y Bas was elected as a member of the Spanish Congress for the province of Barcelona and obtained reelection in 1865, 1879 and 1884. In 1886 he entered the Senate as a representative of the Barcelona Economic Society, and was named senator for life in 1891. From March 4 to October 25, 1899, he served as Minister of Justice in the cabinet of Francisco Silvela.
Impact on Spanish law.
Durán y Bas adhered to Savigny's "historical" school of thought, maintaining that law ought to be a reflection of the "national spirit" as established in local customary law. Accordingly, he opposed the "philosophical" school dominant in 19th century Spain which sought to unify and codify the national law based on the principles of rationalism and natural law.
Although politically opposed to the unifying codification of Spanish law, he was a leading contributor to the 1888 "Código civil." By compiling a list of the institutions of Catalan law that would continue to apply as exceptions under the new Civil Code, he helped to preserve the wealth and influence of Catalonia's leading families, whose advocate he was. His 1888 "Memoria" restating the law of Catalonia caused a lasting revival of Catalan law.

RAF Hell's Mouth

RAF Hell's Mouth was a World War II Royal Air Force grass airfield at Hell's Mouth, (Porth Neigwl) on the Llŷn Peninsula near Abersoch, Gwynedd. 
RAF Hell's Mouth was commissioned in February 1937 as a Relief Landing Ground, later an Emergency landing Ground for RAF Penrhos. It was also an air gunnery and bombing range, with targets on the land, floated 1 mile offshore and towed drogues in the air. A small range railway was in use to provide moving targets. The site was decommissioned in 1945 and returned to agriculture.
Typical aircraft using the airfield were Bristol Blenheim and Armstrong Whitworth Whitley. In August 1944 a Vickers Wellington was successfully landed by a Polish pilot following an engine failure. Despite the mismatch in size, the aircraft also was able to subsequently take off.

<doc id="19298354" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19298354" title="Exterior angle theorem">
Exterior angle theorem

The exterior angle theorem is Proposition 1.16 in Euclid's Elements, which states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is greater than either of the measures of the remote interior angles. This is a fundamental result in absolute geometry because its proof does not depend upon the parallel postulate. In several high school treatments of geometry, the term "exterior angle theorem" has been applied to a different result, namely the portion of Proposition 1.32 which states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the remote interior angles. This result, which depends upon Euclid's parallel postulate will be referred to as the "HSEAT" to distinguish it from Euclid's exterior angle theorem ("EAT"). Some authors refer to the HSEAT as the "strong form" of the exterior angle theorem and the EAT as the "weak form".
Exterior angles.
A triangle has three corners, called "vertices". The sides of a triangle (line segments) that come together at a vertex form two angles (four angles if you consider the sides of the triangle to be lines instead of line segments). Only one of these angles contains the third side of the triangle in its interior, and this angle is called an "interior angle" of the triangle. In the picture below, the angles "∠ABC", "∠BCA" and "∠CAB" are the three interior angles of the triangle. An "exterior angle" is formed by extending one of the sides of the triangle; the angle between the extended side and the other side is the exterior angle. In the picture, angle "∠ACD" is an exterior angle. 
HSEAT.
The high school exterior angle theorem (HSEAT) says that the size of an exterior angle at a vertex of a triangle equals the sum of the sizes of the interior angles at the other two vertices of the triangle (remote interior angles). So, in the picture, the size of angle "ACD" equals the size of angle "ABC" plus the size of angle "CAB".
The HSEAT is logically equivalent to the Euclidean statement that the sum of angles of a triangle is 180°. If it is known that the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is 180°, then the HSEAT is proved as follows:
On the other hand, if the HSEAT is taken as a true statement then:
Proving that the sum of the measures of the angles of a triangle is 180°.
The Euclidean proof of the HSEAT (and simultaneously the result on the sum of the angles of a triangle) starts by constructing the line parallel to side "AB" passing through point "C" and then using the properties of corresponding angles and alternate interior angles of parallel lines to get the conclusion as in the illustration.
The HSEAT can be extremely useful when trying to calculate the measures of unknown angles in a triangle.
EAT.
The proof of Proposition 1.16 (the EAT) given by Euclid is often cited as one place where Euclid gives a flawed proof. The flaw lies in the assertion that a point that is constructed in the course of the proof lies "inside" a particular angle. No reason is given for this assertion, but the accompanying diagram makes it look like a true statement. When a complete set of axioms for Euclidean geometry is used (see Foundations of geometry) this assertion of Euclid can be proved.
The EAT is not valid in spherical geometry nor in the related elliptical geometry. Consider a spherical triangle one of whose vertices is the North Pole and the other two lie on the equator. The sides of the triangle emanating from the North Pole (great circles of the sphere) both meet the equator at right angles, so this triangle has an exterior angle that is equal to a remote interior angle. The other interior angle (at the North Pole) can be made larger than 90°, further emphasizing the failure of this statement. However, since the EAT is a theorem in absolute geometry it is automatically valid in hyperbolic geometry.

Henry Francis Cary

Henry Francis Cary (6 December 1772 – 14 August 1844) was a British author and translator, best known for his blank verse translation of "The Divine Comedy" of Dante.
Biography.
Henry Francis Cary was born in Gibraltar, on 6 December 1772. He was the eldest son of William Cary, at the time a Captain of the First Regiment of Foot, by Henrietta daughter of Theophilus Brocas, Dean of Killala. His grandfather, Henry Cary was archdeacon, and his great grandfather, Mordecai Cary, bishop of that diocese.
He was educated at Rugby School and at the grammar schools of Sutton Coldfield and Birmingham, and at Christ Church, Oxford, which he entered in 1790 and studied French and Italian literature. While at school he regularly contributed to the "Gentleman's Magazine", and published a volume of Sonnets and Odes. He took holy orders and in 1797 became vicar of Abbots Bromley in Staffordshire. He held this benefice until his death. In 1800 he also became vicar of Kingsbury in Warwickshire. 
At Christ Church he studied French and Italian literature which can be seen in his notes to his translation of Dante. The version of the "Inferno" was published in 1805 together with the original text.
Cary moved to London in 1808, where he became reader at the Berkeley Chapel and subsequently lecturer at Chiswick and curate of the Savoy Chapel. His version of the whole "Divina Commedia" in blank verse appeared in 1814. It was published at Cary's own expense, as the publisher refused to undertake the risk, owing to the failure incurred over the "Inferno". The translation was brought to the notice of Samuel Rogers by Thomas Moore. Rogers made some additions to an article on it by Ugo Foscolo in the "Edinburgh Review". This article, and praise bestowed on the work by Coleridge in a lecture at the Royal Institution, led to a general acknowledgment of its merit. Cary's "Dante" gradually took its place among standard works, passing through four editions in the translator's lifetime..
In 1824 Cary published a translation of "The Birds" of Aristophanes, and, about 1834, of the "Odes" of Pindar. In 1826 he was appointed assistant-librarian in the British Museum, a post which he held for about eleven years. He resigned because the appointment of keeper of the printed books, which should have been his in the ordinary course of promotion, was refused to him when it fell vacant. In 1841 a crown pension of £200 a year, obtained through the efforts of Samuel Rogers, was conferred on him. Cary's "Lives of the early French Poets", and "Lives of English Poets" (from Samuel Johnson to Henry Kirke White), intended as a continuation of Johnson's "Lives of the Poets", were published in collected form in 1846. He died in London in 1844 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.
A memoir was published by his son, Judge Henry Cary, in 1847. Another son, Francis Stephen Cary became a well-known art teacher, succeeding Henry Sass as the head of his art academy in London

Kalinikos Kreanga (born March 8, 1972) is a Greek (formerly Romanian) table tennis player. Born as Călin Creangă, he chose to defect from Communist-ruled Romania at the age of 17 (with his father) while he was participating in the European Table Tennis Youth Championships in Luxembourg in 1989.
Born in Bistriţa, Romania, Kreanga started to play table tennis at the age of 7. His first coach was Gheorghe Bozga, who would later discover Mihaela Steff.
While in Luxembourg, he received an offer to play in Greece, so he decided to move there. Being a minor, he quickly acquired Greek citizenship, and changed his name to Kalinikos Kreanga.
He has been one of the dominant European table tennis players since the beginning of the 1990s, and uses the shakehand style to hold the racket. His favorite attack weapons seem to be the topspin forehand loop and a strong backhand shot. His backhand topspin shot is one of the most devastating in the world with unique technique.
Results.
Bronze medal in the mixed doubles competition at the World Championships, Chiba City, 1991.

Esperanza Andrade

Esperanza "Hope" Andrade (born July 1, 1949) is the commissioner representing employers on the Texas Workforce Commission. She is a former Secretary of State of Texas, an appointed position which she held from 2008 to 2012.
As Texas Workforce Commissioner.
An entrepreneur and business and community leader in San Antonio, Texas, for more than three decades, Andrade was confirmed by the Texas Senate as the workforce commissioner in March 2013. She succeeds Tom Pauken, a candidate for governor in the Republican primary election scheduled for March 4, 2014.
As Texas Secretary of State.
As Secretary of State, she served as the state's chief elections officer, chief international protocol officer, and border commerce coordinator for Governor Rick Perry.
As the elections officer, she toured the state encouraging registration and high voter turnout. She also supported the removal of nearly seventy thousand names from the voter rolls of individuals believed to be deceased, based largely on Social Security death records. However, some of the deleted names were of the living, and four individuals sued the state for having been wrongfully stricken from the rolls. Andrade also encountered controversy when prior to the November 6, 2012 general election she objected to the use of international observers examining Texas voting procedures.
She vacated the Secretary of State's office on November 23, 2012, after nearly four-and-a-half years on the job. She was the sixth and longest-serving Texas Secretary of State and the second of three women in the post under Perry. Andrade is the first Hispanic woman to have served as the Texas Secretary of State. However, two Hispanic men, Roy Barrera, Sr., of San Antonio and Henry Cuellar, now a U.S. representative from Laredo, held the position briefly in 1968 and 2001, respectively.
On November 27, 2012, Perry appointed John Thomas Steen, Jr., also of San Antonio, to succeed Andrade as secretary of state. He is an attorney who previously served on the Texas Public Safety Commission and the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. Steen contributed $56,000 to Perry's past gubernatorial campaigns.
As Texas Transportation Commissioner.
Prior to her appointment as Secretary of State, Andrade was appointed by Governor Perry to the Texas Transportation Commission. She became interim chair of the transportation commission in January 2008, upon the death of its previous chair, Ric Williamson, a former member of the Texas House of Representatives; she left the commission in May 2008. Shortly thereafter, in July of the same year, Perry named her Secretary of State when Samuel P. "Phil" Wilson resigned after one year in the position.

SS Persier (1918)

Persier was a 5,382 GRT cargo ship which was built in 1918 as War Buffalo for the British Shipping Controller. In 1919, she was sold to Belgium and renamed "Persier". Between 1934 and 1941 she also held a passenger certificate. She was driven ashore on the Icelandic coast in a storm in February 1941 which put her out of action for two years. Returned to service in February 1943, she served until 11 February 1945, when she was torpedoed and sunk by with the loss of 20 crew.
Description.

The ship was long, with a beam of . She had a depth of and a draught of . She was assessed at 5,349 GRT, 3,271 NRT.
The ship was propelled by a triple expansion steam engine, which had cylinders of , and diameter by stroke. The engine was built by North East Marine Engine Co (1938) Ltd, Newcastle upon Tyne. It produced 517nhp. It could propel the ship at .
History.
"War Buffalo" was built for the British Shipping Controller. Her port of registry was London and she was operated under the management of Ranking, Gilmour & Co Ltd. In 1919, she was sold to Lloyd Royal Belge SA, Antwerp and renamed "Persier", The Code Letters MPDI were allocated. She was the second Lloyd Royal Belge ship to bear that name. On 19 January 1922, "Persier" rescued five crew from the Newfoundlan-registered schooner "Eileen Lake", which foundered in the Atlantic Ocean west of Newfoundland. In 1930, Lloyd Royal Belge was merged with the Compagnie Maritime Belge du Congo to form Compagnie Maritime Belge SA. "Persier" was operated under the management of Agence Maritime Internationale. In 1934, her Code letters were changed to OOZA. Lloyd's Register shows that the ship held a passenger certificate from that date.
In May 1940, "Persier" took part in Operation Dynamo. On 28 October 1940, "Persier" departed Halifax, Nova Scotia as a member of Convoy HX 84. She was carrying a cargo of steel destined of Hull. In December 1940, she was anchored at Oban, Argyllshire when an air raid was carried out by Heinkel He 111 bombers based at Stavanger, Norway. Two bombs fell astern of "Persia". A Dutch ship, the was sunk. Although it was not realised at the time, "Persier" had been damaged in the raid, and some leaks were discovered during her next voyage, which was across the Atlantic. Her destination was Baltimore, Maryland. Once she was fully loaded, further damage was discovered and repairs had to be made, which left her straggling behind her convoy.
On 28 February 1941, "Persier" was battered by a storm, with a hatch cover being ripped off and the steering and electrical systems failing. She was stranded off Myralladur, Iceland and was severely damaged. "Persier" was refloated in April, and towed to Reykjavík by the tug "Aegir" for initial repairs to be made. On 9 June, "Persier" was taken to the Kleppsvik Strand, but broke her back as she was insufficiently supported, and was subsequently beached. On 8 February 1942, she was refloated and re-beached, finally being refloated on 20 May. She was towed by the tugs "Empire Bascobel" and "Empire Larch" to a Tyneside shipyard for repairs, which were completed in February 1943. "Persiers" first voyage on return to service was from Liverpool to New York, United States as a member of Convoy ON 169. Departing on 22 February, the convoy arrived on 21 March. In September 1943, "Persier" was a member of Convoy SC 141, which departed Halifax, Nova Scotia on 3 September, and arrived at Liverpool on 17 September. She was carrying a cargo of steel and woodpulp and was bound for London.
In 1944, "Persier" was selected to be one of the blockships when Operation Overlord, the invasion of France took place. Although she was prepared for scuttling, the decision was later reversed and she was refitted and returned to service. On 8 February 1945 "Persier" began her final voyage as part of Convoy BTC 65, setting off from Cardiff to take food to the liberated but starving people of Belgium. Carrying the convoy's Commodore, "Persier" was carrying a cargo consisting 2,400 tons soup, 1,400 tons dried eggs, 1,000 tons meat and 20 tons of general cargo. On 11 February 1945 "Persier" was off the Eddystone Lighthouse when she was hit by one of three torpedoes fired by . The ship developed a list to port and began to sink by the bows. One of the lifeboats was swamped and another was driven into the propeller, which was still turning. Twenty of the 51 crew, 8 naval personnel and four stowaways were killed. The British coasters "Birker Force" and "Gem" rescued seven and 20 people respectively. rescued 16 people. Although "Persier" was taken in tow, she later sank.
Wreck.
In 1969, the wreck of "Persier" was discovered by Plymouth Sound British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) at . She sits on her port side in of water, with the bow at a depth of .
In 1975, a diabetic diver was injured on the wreck, resulting in a ban by BSAC of diving by diabetics.
This ban has now been lifted. The wreck of "Persier" is host to a variety of marine life, including conger eels and lobsters.

Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Mohamedou

Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Mohamedou sometimes spelled Mohammad-Mahmoud Mohamedou (born 1968) is a Harvard University scholar who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mauritania from 2008 until 2009. He is currently a Visiting Professor at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, and Head of the Middle East and North Africa Program at the Geneva Center for Security Policy and is regarded as a leading international specialist on the new forms of transnational terrorism.
Academic and diplomatic career.
Mohamedou was born in Atar, Mauritania and studied in Spain, France, and the United States where he earned a PhD in Political Science at the City University of New York. In 1996, he was Visiting Scholar at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies of Harvard University and in 1997 Research Associate at the Ralph Bunche Institute on the United Nations in New York.
He was Director of Research at the International Council on Human Rights Policy, located in Geneva, from 1998 to 2004, where he conducted research on national human rights institutions, journalism coverage of rights issues, and co-authored a report on the persistence and mutation of racism and economic exclusion.
From 2004 to 2008, Mohamedou was Associate Director of the Program on Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research at Harvard University where he founded the Transnational and Non-State Armed Groups Project. 
He was appointed as Ambassador and Director of Multilateral Cooperation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation in Mauritania in 2008, and subsequently Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. He went back to academia in 2009.
He teaches political science at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva since 2010, and is Head of the Middle East and North Africa Program at the Geneva Center for Security Policy.
As an author.
Mohamedou wrote an influential book on Al Qaeda entitled "Understanding Al Qaeda: The Transformation of War" which was published in 2006 in the United Kingdom by Pluto Press, and 2007 in the United States by the University of Pennsylvania Press. An expanded and revised version retitled "Understanding Al Qaeda: Changing War and Global Politics" was released in 2011. 
Reviews of the book highlighted its innovative nature, "refreshing and rational" approach, and sharp language reminiscent of critical theorist Slavoj Žižek. Columbia University's Mahmood Mamdani has noted that "Mohamedou provides a much-needed secular understanding of Al Qaeda. Unlike most writers, he insists on understanding the changing significance of Al Qaeda's discourse against a historical backdrop", while Emory University's Abdullahi An-Naim pointed out Mohamedou's "sober analysis" as "essential reading". One reviewer noted that: " has presented an entirely new perspective on the subject. This makes the book a must read, for scholars as well as students of international politics." Indeed, Mohamedou's insistence on treating Al Qaeda as a political rather than religious group has led to his characterization as "perhaps the first liberal to attempt a fully secular understanding of Al Qaeda".
Mohamedou is also the author of "Iraq and the Second Gulf War: State-Building and Regime Security". Originally published in 1998 by Austin & Winfeld in San Francisco and reprinted in 2002, that book has been considered "a model for further studies on the Gulf War".
In French, Mohamedou wrote "Contre-Croisade: Origines et Conséquences du 11 Septembre", an in-depth investigation of the events leading up to and after the September 11 attacks, which was published by l'Harmattan in Paris in 2004 and reissued in 2011 under the title "Contre-Croisade: Le 11 Septembre et le Retournement du Monde". An Arabic version was published in 2010.
He has contributed chapters to other books, notably "Violent Non-State Actors in Contemporary World Politics" (Columbia University Press, 2010), "Rethinking the Foreign Policies of the Global South – Seeking Conceptual Frameworks" (Lynne Reinner, 2003), and "Governance, and Democratization in the Middle East" (Avebury Press, 1998).
Among his most influential works is a study on the mutation of the modern forms of war and the rise of transnational terrorism published by Harvard University in 2005 entitled "Non-Linearity of Engagement", from which an op-ed was derived and published in "The New York Times" and "The Boston Globe".
Updating Martin Van Creveld's 1991 "The Transformation of War" and Herfried Munkler's 2005 "The New Wars", Mohamedou's work has been hailed as one of the latter-day most insightful and detached scientific analysis of Al Qaeda, examining in particular the mechanics of its regionalization, franchising, away of what he termed a 'mother Al Qaeda' (Al Qaeda al Oum), and assessing the long-term impact of the new forms of terrorism and 'the militarization of Islamism'.
Mohamedou has also written on democratization issues in other media including "Le Monde" "Le Monde Diplomatique"; and "Libération" appeared on BBC World News, BBC2, Al Jazeera, Al Jazeera English, Voice of America, Radio France Internationale, France 2, France3, France 24 Deutsche Welle, VPRO, Swiss television, Swiss Radio, NECN and ABC News, and has been a guest-blogger on "The Washington Note" writing on post-9/11 US policy and American society, and the Arab Spring. A regular public speaker, Mohamedou served on the advisory council of the Dart Center for Journalism and Adviser to the Small Arms Survey.

Wait (Seven Mary Three song)

"Wait" is a song by Seven Mary Three and the lead single from their fifth studio album, "The Economy of Sound", released on June 5, 2001. It also served as the English lead single to the "Crazy/Beautiful" film soundtrack released three weeks later (La Ley's "Every Time/Siempre" was its Spanish lead single). "Wait" has since become one of the band's most popular songs, having reached #7 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks. It also entered radio as the #1 Most Added record of the format in its first two weeks.
Overview.
Stylistically, "Wait" is a slight detour from Seven Mary Three's early post-grunge hits. Its chorus features wailing vocals in an upbeat melody reminiscent of the 1970 hit "Signs." Characteristic of many Seven Mary Three singles, its mid-tempo verses also feature prominent guitar harmonics and a softness that builds into the aggressive and vibrant chorus. Lyrically, "Wait" deals with the realization of time wasted, taking life's luxuries for granted, and the narrator's subsequent wisdom gained through his or her experiences.
Along with much of the "Crazy/Beautiful" soundtrack, "Wait" was criticized by Amazon.com editorialist Rickey Wright as a potential "Goo Goo Dolls knockoff or a Bon Jovi homage." However, John Duffy of AllMusic described the song as "catchy" and noted it among the "focused hooks" of "The Economy of Sound".
Music videos.
Two videos were produced for "Wait." The initial version was directed by "Crazy/Beautiful" director John Stockwell under Planet, Inc. Shot in Los Angeles in May 2001, it features the film's principals Kirsten Dunst and Jay Hernandez and debuted on June 18, 2001. The second version of "Wait" is simply a concert performance of the song which retains the live audio.

2008 Nikon Indy 300

The 2008 Nikon Indy 300 was the 19th and final race of the 2008 IndyCar Series season. It was held on 26 October 2008 on the Surfers Paradise Street Circuit in Queensland, Australia.
It was the first time the race was held for the Indy Racing League after 17 years as a Champ Car race. The race did not count towards the 2008 Indycar season points as the race date was held after Chicagoland Speedway, which was preset as the season finale prior to the merger of Champ Car and IRL.
The race was won by an Australian driver for the first time in the 18 year history of the event with Ryan Briscoe winning for Team Penske after leading much of the race, while pushed hard by the near-local, New Zealander Scott Dixon. Ryan Hunter-Reay emerged from an entertaining dice to complete the podium in third position.
Team changes.
With the championship decided, some teams used the race as a prelude to the 2009 season. Dario Franchitti made his return to IndyCar after a failed attempt at breaking into NASCAR, taking Dan Wheldon's seat at Chip Ganassi Racing, with Wheldon moving on to his 2009 team, Panther Racing, replacing Vitor Meira. Meira moved to his new team, A. J. Foyt Enterprises.
Qualifying.
Rain fell on early parts of qualifying which caught several cars out, most notably Danica Patrick who hit the wall on her out lap wrecking the nose of the car and putting her out of qualifying without a lap recorded. The rain stopped fairly early and Ryan Hunter-Reay made best fist of the conditions, topping Group 1 two and a half tenths of a second clear of Alex Tagliani. The group was well spaced with Vitor Meira and E. J. Viso almost a second behind the top two and well clear of the final two cars to advance, Mario Moraes and Ryan Briscoe. Graham Rahal missed the cut by less than two-tenths of a second with Oriol Servià the other car unlucky to miss out.
Will Power continued to show the pace he'd shown through practice to top the second group, almost four second faster the Group 1 as the track dried. Tony Kanaan shadowed the local hero with Justin Wilson within a tenth of Kanaan. Scott Dixon and returning team mate Dario Franchitti progressed while again a Penske car sat on the bubble, Hélio Castroneves the last car to make it into Group 2. Marco Andretti was well down on Castroneves while Dan Wheldon made a troubled debut for his new team, missing the cut by almost two seconds.
Dixon topped Section 2 track times improving from over 1:50 to 1:39.2049 for Dixon's best lap. Castroneves improved to second ahead of Kanaan, who would subsequently lose his bets lap and drop out of the top six, Franchitti and Briscoe. Power having led much of the session stopped early and had a nervous wait as his time was rapidly bettered, but made it through with Hunter-Reay joining the Firestone Fast Six.
Dixon, Power and Briscoe swapped top times early until Power started to dominate. With time running out Dixon recorded a 1:35.7672, the fastest lap time recorded in all of qualifying with Briscoe and Franchitti filling the top three when on his last lap Power backed off and found something for a last charge, recording a 1:34.9451, smashing the Fast Six field by eight tenths of a second.
Race.
Justin Wilson pitted on the warm-up lap with the gearbox sticking in third, but rejoined to start from the back. Will Power immediately dominated the start, pulling a two second lead on the first lap. Scott Dixon started second but after being forced to cut the first chicane was relegated behind Ryan Briscoe by the officials.
Mario Moraes and Vitor Meira clashed at the second chicane with Meira spinning without hitting anyone. A few lap later Moraes caused the first safety car, clipping the turn 2 chicane, breaking the right rear corner of the car. Townsend Bell was eliminated after a clash with Helio Castroneves which wrecked Bell's steering. Later the same lap Castroneves had a right rear puncture caused by Danica Patrick's front wing while passing the Andretti Green Racing driver.
Lap 17 saw the end of Power's dominance of the meeting as he crashed at the Bartercard chicane, which put Briscoe into the lead ahead of Dixon. Briscoe pitted for fuel immediately upon catching backmarker Patrick, but Dixon waited another lap and was held up behind her. At the same time Graham Rahal touched the rear of Car 20, spinning the Vision Racing car at the bottom corner and Ed Carpenter stopped as well, almost blocking the track. The emerging safety car almost hit Dixon as he completed his stop.
Behind the safety car Patrick stopped and stalled, almost hitting the stationary car of Carpenter. Dario Franchitti clipped the tyre bundle on the inside of the same chicane and spun and stalled bringing out the safety car. After the restart Tony Kanaan had the right rear suspension break without apparent reason.
After the second round of pitstops the battle for third between Alex Tagliani and Ryan Hunter-Reay was interrupted by Dario Franchitti as poor pitstop and a poor pit position for Conquest Racing saw Tagliani drop several position behind EJ Viso. Viso later would twice have to give up spots for cutting chicanes, first to Tagliani, then Castroneves. Lap 48 saw Jaime Camara go straight on and stalled the car attempting to recover.
In the races closing stages Dixon closed in on Briscoe, the two remaining local drivers lapping significantly faster than the rest of the field. Ed Carpenter hit the wall at turn 3 on the last lap but it did not affect the lead battle and Briscoe won his home race ahead of Dixon. Ryan Hunter-Reay finished third.

James Bryant (Kent cricketer)

James Bryant (died May 1755, probably at Bromley, Kent) was an English professional cricketer who played first-class cricket during the 1740s. He was mainly associated with Bromley Cricket Club and Kent. Although information about his career is limited by a lack of surviving data, he is known to have made 11 single wicket and 11 first-class appearances between 1744 and 1751. His brother was John Bryant.
Cricket career.
The first definite mention of James Bryant occurs on Monday, 1 October 1744, in a lucrative "threes" match at the Artillery Ground in which his brother also played. They were on opposite sides: James teamed with Robert Colchin and Joe Harris; John with Val Romney and Thomas Waymark.
During the next three seasons, the Bryants were regularly involved in major fixtures, both first-class and single wicket. In 1747, they played for Kent against All-England in the biggest first-class match of the season. In early August 1747, there were two single wicket matches at the Artillery Ground which were organised by the 2nd Duke of Richmond. In the first, three of his employees Stephen Dingate, Joseph Rudd and Pye defeated Little Bennett, Tall Bennett and William Anderson. In the second, the same threes were to play again but in a "fives" match with the two Bryants added to the Duke's team and with Tom Faulkner and one of Joe or John Harris to their opponents. The result of the second game is unknown.
1748 was the great year of single wicket, which has never been more popular before or since. There were five matches in which both Bryants took part and one which featured John only. 
In 1749, the brothers were "given men" playing for Surrey against All-England and then both played for Colchin's invitation XI against Stephen Dingate's team. There was a tri-series of matches between Kent and Surrey in 1750 with the brothers both playing for Kent, who won the first and third matches of the series, the decider by 1 wicket. Later in the season, they played for Dartford as given men against Addington, Dartford winning the match by 6 runs, and then for Dingate's "fives" team in a tri-series against Tom Faulkner's side.
James Bryant made his last known appearances in 1751 when he was in the Kent team that lost twice to All-England in May. John did not play in these matches. There were two Bromley v Dartford games later in the 1751 season but it is not known who took part. James Bryant died four years later.

Minokawa

Minokawa is a giant bird that belongs to the dragon family. Early people believed that this creature is so big that it can swallow (or cover) the sun to explain of occurrence of eclipses. It is even described as a giant bird named "Minokawa" that lives in outer space which can devour the sun and the moon, and would try to do the same with the earth.
In a Bagobo tale, the "Minokawa" is a bird as large as an island. Its feathers are those of sharp swords, the eyes reflect like mirrors, its beak and legs are like steel. It lives "outside the sky, at the eastern horizon". While the Baua lived "above the sky" because the Visayans believe that there is a cave called "calulundan" above the sky, the entrance covered by blue smoke.
Basic Legend.
Before time began, very long ago, a great bird called "Minokawa" swallowed the moon. Seized with fear, all the people began to scream and made great noises. Then the bird peeped down to see what the matter was, and opened his mouth. But as soon as he opened his mouth, the moon sprang out and ran away.
The "Minokawa"-bird is as large as the Island of Negros or Bohol. It has a beak of steel, and his claws too are of steel. His eyes are mirrors, and each single feather is a sharp sword. He lives outside the sky, at the eastern horizon, ready to seize the moon and after the unsuccessful attempt of swallowing the satellite, it journeys and haunts again lurking under the earth.
The moon makes eight holes in the eastern horizon to come out of, and eight holes in the western horizon to go into, because every day the big bird tries to catch her, and she is afraid. The exact moment he tries to swallow her is just when she is about to come in through one of the holes in the east to shine on us again. If the "Minokawa" should swallow the moon, and the sun too, he would then come down to earth and gulp down men also. But when the moon is in the belly of the big bird, and the sky is dark, then all the Bagobo people will scream and cry, and beat gongs, because they fear they will all be eaten. Soon this racket makes the "Minokawa"-bird look down and "open his mouth to hear the sound." Then the moon jumps out of the bird's mouth and runs away.

Thea Stabell

Thea Stabell (born 4 July 1939), née Dorothea Jessie Pierstorff, is a Norwegian actress. Stabell's mother was American, and her father worked for the Foreign Service. As a result she had a nomadic lifestyle growing up, living in both the United States, France and Belgium. She graduated from the Norwegian National Academy of Theatre in 1964, and had her début the same year in the play "Boyfriend" at Oslo Nye Teater. She has since acted both at Torshovteatret, Hålogaland Teater and Nationaltheatret (the National Theatre), while all the while working as an instructor at "Teaterhøyskolen". In 2006 she was hired as a professor here, as the first of her kind with an acting background, not an academic one.
Among the general public Stabell is best remembered for her role as "Ingrid Femte" in the 1972 comedy "Norske byggeklosser". She has also acted in other well-known Norwegian movies, such as "Balladen om mestertyven Ole Høiland" (1970) and "Mannen som ikke kunne le" (1968), and more recently also in TV-series, among these "Seks som oss" (2005–2007) and "Ved kongens bord" (2005). Stabell is married and has one daughter.

Charles Ancliffe

Charles Ancliffe (1880–1952) was a British composer of light music, chiefly remembered for his waltzes.
Life and works.
Charles Ancliffe was born in Kildare, Ireland, the son of an army bandmaster. 
After studying at the Royal Military School of Music, Kneller Hall, he followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a bandmaster himself. From 1900 to 1918 he was Bandmaster of the First Battalion, South Wales Borderers, seeing much service in India. During this period he wrote many popular pieces of music including marches such as "The Liberators", and "Castles in Spain." 
He also composed dozens of short genre pieces, often styled 'intermezzo' or 'entr'acte', several songs and ingeniously titled suites such as "Below Bridges." which had the titles" Wapping Old Stairs, Poplar" and "Stepney Church," — all London bridges.
Around the time of the First World War Ancliffe composed many waltzes, and it is mainly for these that he is remembered. These included "Hesitation, Alpine Echoes, and Smiles Then Kisses", the titles reflecting the age in which they were written. Several of these enjoyed renewed popularity with the fashion for ‘olde-tyme dancing’ after World War II.
"Nights of Gladness".
It was for "Nights of Gladness", written in 1912, that Ancliffe became most famous. The waltz became so popular all over the world that in later years the BBC named a long-running series of light music programmes after it, using it as the signature tune 
Nearly a hundred years after it was written it is still to be found included on many CD compilations of light music, played by notable orchestras such as the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.
After leaving the services Charles Ancliffe was a regular conductor of the Scarborough Military Band, and was also a frequent guest conductor of his own works on BBC Radio.

Hocking Valley Railway

The Hocking Valley Railway was a railroad in the U.S. state of Ohio, with a main line from Toledo to Athens and Pomeroy via Columbus. It also had several branches to the coal mines of the Hocking Valley near Athens. The company became part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway system in 1910, and the line between Toledo and Columbus continues to see trains as CSX Transportation's Columbus Subdivision. Portions of the main line south of Columbus are now operated by the Indiana and Ohio Railway and Hocking Valley Scenic Railway.
At the end of 1925, HV operated 349 miles of road on 881 miles of track; that year it reported 2614 million ton-miles of revenue freight and 25 million passenger-miles.
History.
The earliest predecessor of the Hocking Valley was the Mineral Railroad, incorporated in April 1864 to build from Athens in the rich Hocking Valley to Columbus. The company changed its name to the Columbus and Hocking Valley Railroad in June 1867, shortly after construction began at Columbus, and the line opened for business from Columbus to Lancaster on January 20, 1869, Logan on August 28, 1869, Nelsonville on September 17, 1869, and Athens on July 25, 1870. The first branch, from Logan east to New Straitsville, was completed in January 1871, and the railroad completed a cutoff from Nelsonville north alongside Monday Creek to the Straitsville Branch in 1880. Several more branches reached additional mines in the Logan-Nelsonville area, including along Snow Fork (initially incorporated in July 1875 as the Snow Fork Valley Railroad) to Orbiston (1877), Murray City (1882), and Coalgate (1893), and along Brush Fork to New Pittsburg (1877-78).
The Columbus and Toledo Railroad was incorporated in May 1872 to connect its namesake cities on an eastern route through Delaware, Marion, Upper Sandusky, and Fostoria. Construction, delayed by the Panic of 1873, began in August 1875, and the line was opened from Columbus to Marion on November 1, 1876, and the rest of the way to Walbridge, outside Toledo, on January 11, 1877. Trackage rights were acquired over the Toledo and Woodville Railroad (a Pennsylvania Railroad subsidiary) to reach Toledo, including a dock on the Maumee River to handle Hocking Valley coal and iron ore.
The final piece of the system was incorporated in March 1870 as the Gallipolis, McArthur and Columbus Railroad, which would build from Gallipolis on the Ohio River to Logan. It acquired part of an incomplete roadbed graded in the 1850s by the Scioto and Hocking Valley Railroad between Hamden and Logan, but was unable to survive the Panic of 1873. The Columbus and Gallipolis Railway, incorporated in July 1876, tried to complete the line on an extended route to Columbus, but ran out of funds, and yet another company, the Ohio and West Virginia Railway, was incorporated in May 1878 to continue construction. The north end was moved back to Logan a year later, and construction began in July 1879, now allied with the Columbus and Hocking Valley. Operation over the full route commenced on October 15, 1880, and a branch alongside the river to Pomeroy was completed in January 1881.
The three companies merged in August 1881 to form the Columbus, Hocking Valley and Toledo Railway, which stretched across the state from Toledo to Pomeroy. A short extension near Toledo was built in 1890, connecting to the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway (a New York Central Railroad subsidiary) at Rockwell Junction. The new company entered receivership in February 1897 and was reorganized in February 1899 as the Hocking Valley Railway, which came under the control of a syndicate in December 1902. The stock was distributed among several railroad companies in June 1903, with one-third going to the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Pennsylvania Railroad) and one-sixth each to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O), Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway (New York Central Railroad), and Erie Railroad. The C&O gained control in March 1910, and initially used the Kanawha and Michigan Railway to make the connection from Charleston, but in 1917 it opened the first piece of the Northern Subdivision, which joined the main line at Limeville with Norfolk and Western Railway trackage rights to Columbus, and in 1927 a separate line to Columbus was completed. When the C&O acquired control of the Pere Marquette Railway in 1929, the Hocking Valley served as its connection to the rest of the system. Finally, the Hocking Valley was merged into the C&O in April 1930.
A small branch railroad was organized in 1903 as the Athens, Amesville and Chauncey Railway. Its trackage was 3.65 miles in 1907, and 5.99 miles in 1908. It was built expressly to service coal mines in the Sugar Creek valley north of Athens, Ohio, and connected to the Hocking Valley Railway mainline just northwest of Athens. It was built by coal interests, but operated by the Hocking Valley Railway, and was merged into it in 1911. This line never ventured anywhere near Amesville or Chauncey, and did not even technically connect to Athens. After the merger, it was known as the Sugar Creek Branch.

Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health

The Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health (CSCHAH) is an infectious disease laboratory complex in Winnipeg, Manitoba owned and operated by the Government of Canada. This modern facility is home to two laboratories: The Public Health Agency of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD). It is the workplace of approximately 500 federal employees.
While most of the laboratory space is dedicated to Containment Level 2 (also known as Biosafety Level 2) and Containment Level 3 laboratories, CSCHAH is the only facility in Canada operating Containment Level 4 (CL4) laboratories and is believed to be the first in the world to have both human and animal Level 4 laboratories under one roof. Level 4 laboratories are designed to allow scientists to safely handle the most serious infectious agents. Their design, construction, and engineering controls safeguard against the release of any infectious material.
Both NML and NCFAD operate critical diagnostic testing programs relied on across the country. These programs protect human health, animal health, and international trade. Staff also undertake cutting-edge research to advance scientific knowledge, improve diagnostics and develop therapeutics to protect health.
History.
In the 1980’s, both Agriculture Canada (prior to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency being formed) and Health Canada identified the need to replace existing laboratory space that was reaching the end of its lifespan as well as the need for Containment Level 4 space in the country. Numerous benefits were identified for housing both laboratories in one building, including cost savings. Winnipeg was chosen as the site and an announcement was made in October 1987.
After some debate, the spot chosen for the site was a city works yard near to the Health Sciences Centre (a major teaching hospital) and the University of Manitoba’s medical school. The City of Winnipeg transferred the title for $1. Construction of the facility that came to be named the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health (often referred to locally as “the Virology Lab”) began with an official groundbreaking in December 1992. The design team, headed by the Winnipeg-based Smith Carter Architects and Engineers Inc., visited laboratories around the world to seek best practices in containment and design. Construction finished toward the end of 1997, with the first programs beginning in the spring of 1998 following an extensive commissioning process. The rest of the laboratories then became operational one by one. The official opening took place in 1999.
Since then, the laboratories in the facility have been instrumental in responding to a number of significant infectious disease outbreaks: The 2003 SARS outbreak when NML led the laboratory response; the 2003 BSE case when NCFAD provided the diagnosis of the initial case and then undertook testing as part of a vast investigation; the 2004 avian influenza outbreak in BC for which NCFAD led the laboratory investigation; and the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza where Mexico sought help from NML in identifying the unknown respiratory pathogen, to name just a few.
Co-location.
The primary reason for housing the two laboratories in the same complex was economic. It saves the citizens of Canada money by only having one facility to operate with a number of shared services also keeping costs down. However, the partnership between these two world leading labs also allows for collaboration and cooperation on established, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Many of the viruses, bacteria and prions studied at CSCHAH are zoonotic, meaning that they can transfer from animals to humans. Co-location of these labs allows scientists to work together on these shared challenges and to take advantage of each other’s complementary expertise and unique resources. This model is held in high regard within the international containment laboratory community.
Facility.
CSCHAH is a state-of-the-art, 332,766 square foot complex. Built to exceed national and international standards, CSCHAH maintains its high level of excellence through ongoing maintenance and regular upgrades. The complex is built as a series of program-specific blocks interconnected by an area dedicated to common elements for both departments such as the library, cafeteria, and theatre.
CSCHAH houses laboratories to manage any type of infectious organism from the most common to the most exotic. Containment Level 2 (CL2) laboratories are the same as what can be found at a hospital or doctor’s office; 60.8% of CSCHAH lab space is dedicated to level 2. Containment Level 3 involves specific engineering controls and protocols to ensure the safety of lab staff, the public and the environment; 35.5% of CSCHAH lab space is CL3 space, the majority of which is dedicated to animal pathogens. Although the facility is thought of as a “Level 4 facility,” only 3.7% of lab space is used for CL4. Level 4, with its special construction and biosafety suits, is necessary to work with the most serious of pathogens including Ebola, Nipah, and Marburg.
Following the SARS outbreak in 2003, lessons learned resulted in a number of changes to public health in Canada. Among those were the creation of the Public Health Agency of Canada and the construction of a high-tech operations centre at CSCHAH. This operations centre is the hub of the National Microbiology Laboratory when there is an outbreak or a deployment of personnel off-site. It is equipped with three separate phone systems, can videoconference with 38 participants at a time, and can connect via satellite to remote locations around the world. Virtually all staff at NML are trained in the Incident Command System and are able to jump into action at a moment’s notice if there is a public health event of some type.
A three-story expansion to the building was completed in 2011. Funded by the Government of Canada’s Economic Action Plan, the expanded and renovated areas include specimen receiving, shipping and receiving, bio-repository, media preparation, office, and meeting space.
Safety.
CSCHAH was designed for safety; it was built to meet or exceed all national and international standards. The construction, engineering controls and sterilization systems are geared toward the highest level of safety.
Safety is of paramount importance to everyone working in the facility. Extensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are in place and everyone is well-trained for the specific area they work in. A Safety and Environmental Services (SES) team provides numerous "hands-on" demonstrations and presentations on biosafety and occupational health and safety throughout the year and provides 24/7 response to biological or chemical issues.
Any material exiting the level 3 or 4 laboratories must be sterilized or decontaminated in some manner. Air is drawn into the laboratories through the use of negative air pressure before being filtered out through High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters. Laboratory waste such as gloves, test tubes, and pipette tips are removed via an autoclave, a piece of equipment that sterilizes materials with steam and pressure. Any liquids leaving the high-containment space go through a biowaste system that operates like a large autoclave to sterilize it. The high-containment labs are built as a box-in-a-box; they do not border exterior walls and there are mechanical spaces above and below them.
Security.
CSCHAH is a high-security facility. Security staff work closely with local police, RCMP and CSIS to ensure an appropriate level of security at all times. Only the lobby area is open to the public; all guests must be escorted within the secure area at all times. All staff working at in the facility have Secret Level II security clearance. Further details on security at the facility are not disclosable.
Community Liaison Committee.
The Community Liaison Committee to the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health was struck by the ministers of Health and Agriculture in 1999. The committee’s first meeting took place in January 2000. It was to create a basis for and to maintain an atmosphere of public trust and confidence between the centre and the community.
The committee consists of volunteer members representing a wide range of organizations including community residents, scientists, health care professionals, and agricultural professionals. The committee meets at least four times per year, holds regular public information sessions and issues reports on their activities. Other laboratories have modelled this approach. 
At the committee’s request, CSCHAH developed reporting guidelines to determine the extent of communication around any incidents that may take place at the centre. This ensures that the committee and others are apprised of incidents of any significance in a timely manner plus they have access to information on each and every incident no matter how minor, at their meetings.

Joe Harris (cricketer)

Joseph (Joe) Harris (dates of birth and death unknown) and his brother John Harris (dates of birth and death unknown) were English cricketers in the 1740s and 1750s. They both played for Addington Cricket Club, which had one of the strongest teams in England at the time, and for Surrey.
With the Harris brothers playing, the Addington club first came to prominence on 25 July 1743 when its team defeated London Cricket Club at the Artillery Ground by an innings & 4 runs. London made 32 & 74; Addington 110.
John Harris top scored with 47 for Slindon against London in the 1744 match from which the earliest known scorecard has survived. Later that season, both the Harrises played for All-England against Kent in the second match that has a surviving scorecard.
The single wicket form of the game was very popular in the 1740s and the Harris brothers were frequently involved in matches that attracted high stakes, which underlines what good players they were. They continued playing into the 1750s but very little is known about them outside contemporary match reports.

Li M'Ha Ong

Li Ma Li-hong or M'Hâ Ong (ca. 650 – ca. 730) was a Chinese scholar from Jiangnan, from a family of official clerks involved in tea transactions.
He is assumed to be the author of the translation of Christian texts into Chinese but also the transmission of Buddhist texts in Sanskrit. He was a member of the "Library of corrections and embellishments" of the Imperial Palace.
Only one piece of composition is definitively attributed to him. Although the original was lost, "Treaty of Seeds and Stars" is known through the copy and translation, unfortunately partial, done by Melchior Nuñez, possibly from a Sogdian original. Nuñez arrived in China in 1555 and had a sophisticated knowledge of Chinese. He gave this valuable work to Matteo Ricci which included, in addition, a half-dozen landscapes of the green and blue era - including a "three mountains" composition - a very popular motif in the Tang Dynasty.
Nuñez described him as a Nestorian monk but it is likely that the Jesuit used this trick to give the translation a Nestorian impression with impunity.
The early Christians arrived in China during the Tang Dynasty 618 - 907) and are indeed Nestorians of Iranian origin. They studied Chinese to better explain concepts of the Christian faith to the Chinese but their biggest challenge is finding a suitable vocabulary, which inevitably involves a long theory of proofreading and corrections. Among the 70,000 rolls discovered in 1909 in the Thousand Buddhas Cave, sealed in the tenth century, there are some Nestorian texts, a few of them in Sogdian.
Very quickly cut off from their roots, these Nestorians often had to make theological decisions without being able to refer to any authority. Over time, they relied increasingly in Chinese culture and attract the sympathy of some Chinese scholars, some of which are converted. Nevertheless, they remain little known because they don't interest scholars of the predominant religion in China, Taoism. The little that is known of their small communities, however, is extremely accurate and detailed information.
By the middle of the ninth century, however, during the reign of Wu Tang Zong, all "barbarian" (i.e. foreign) religions are prohibited in China. There were Nestorians present in the Court of Kubilai Khan whose mother was a Nestorian and where they are close to power. In the seventeenth century, the Nestorians have quite disappeared from China.
Two anonymous paintings are tentatively attributed to Li Ma-hong (private collection):

In July 1995, the jail, initially the Atascocita State Jail, opened. After Pam Lychner, a "victim's rights" activist, died on board TWA Flight 800 with her daughters on July 17, 1996, the TDCJ board unanimously voted to rename the facility to Pam Lychner State Jail.
The Pam Lychner State Jail, along with the Joe Kegans State Jail, serves state jail offenders from Harris County. Lychner and Kegans have the same wardens and management. As of 2001 Lychner serves higher risk and special needs offenders. By classification the unit has low risk, medium risk, high risk, and security risk offenders.
A statue of Lychner and her daughters is located outside of the state jail grounds.

Jim Corr (politician)

James A. "Jim" Corr (born 25 January 1934) is an Irish Fine Gael politician and retired secondary school teacher and former principal of South Presentation school.
Corr is a member of Cork City Council. He was first co-opted to the council (then called Cork Corporation) in 1973, and elected at the 1974 local elections. He was Lord Mayor of Cork in 1979 and 1996.
When the five-seat Cork South–Central constituency was created in 1980, Fine Gael's support was sufficient for two seats. Peter Barry was the party's senior Teachta Dála (TD); Corr had a rivalry with Hugh Coveney for the second Fine Gael seat. Coveney narrowly beat Corr at the 1981 general election, but Corr won by a larger margin in February 1982. Becoming disillusioned with Dáil politics, Corr stood aside in November 1982, with Coveney regaining the seat. Corr was to stand as a third Fine Gael candidate at the 1987 general election, but stood aside to avoid splitting the Fine Gael vote, though Coveney lost his seat in any event. Corr was unsuccessful at the 1989 and 1992 general elections. 
Corr was unhappy that John Cushnahan was selected ahead of him as Fine Gael candidate in Munster at the 1989 European Parliament election. Corr stood unsuccessfully in Munster at the 1999 European Parliament election.
Corr taught geography, and wrote a school textbook in 1972. He spent six years working in Africa. He was a trade union activist, and considered on the left wing of Fine Gael in the early 1980s. He was appointed to the Board of Bord Gáis in 1997. He has been chairman of the advisory board of European Cities Against Drugs since 2002.

List of The Golden Path characters

This article contains character information for the Singaporean television drama series "The Golden Path".
Main characters.
Huang Family.
Xiao Gu.
Xiao Gu, whose real name is Su Lifang (苏丽芳), is the matriarch of the family. A native of Kedah in Malaysia, she came to Singapore before the series started, and married Ah Shun. Together, they sold cooked foods for a living. Later, Ah Shun died of a grave, unspecified illness, and left Xiao Gu juggling with three small children, as well as the responsibility for their livelihood. Eventually, Xiao Gu expanded her food operation to a roadside stall. Xiao Gu, in accordance with her late husband's wishes, named the stall "Happy Restaurant" (幸福飯店).
Xiao Gu eventually met her second husband, Ah Jin, after he saved her life in a dangerous situation. Xiao Gu and Ah Jin eventually grew close, and decides to get married. However, it was later revealed that Ah Jin, who claims to be a sailor, was a thief who, along with two other people, perpetrated the largest Jewelry Store robbery since Singaporean Independence. Ah Jin's whereabouts was eventually tipped off by Xiao Gu's son, Kaijie, and Ah Jin was surrounded by police on his wedding day with Xiao Gu. Ah Jin chose to commit suicide rather than be arrested.
Xiao Gu eventually expanded her food business, and by 1995, Happy Restaurant became a moderately famous restaurant in Singapore. Xiao Gu also bought a food bazaar and a coffee shop to further expand her business empire. However, the money that was used to expand her empire was ill-gotten: they were the proceeds from Ah Jin's stolen jewelry. Moments before Ah Jin killed himself, he secretly told Xiao Gu where the jewelry was stashed, and Xiao Gu later stole the jewelry.
Towards the end of the series, Xiao Gu realized that these ill-gotten wealth caused her sons and daughters untold misery, so she decided to sell off all her businesses, and restart her business elsewhere.
Ah Shun.
Ah Shun is only seen in flashbacks. He married Xiao Gu at an unspecified time, and together, they sold cooked foods for a living. Ah Shun suffered from a grave, but unspecified illness before the start of the series, and consequently died. He has connections to the local triads, as his friend, Ah Cheng, helped him out with medical costs.
Kaida.
Kaida is one of the most academically inclined member of the family, eventually attending medical school and becoming a doctor. Personally, he was on good terms with Jinlong, who, since his father's suicide, harboured misgivings against the Huangs. Jinfeng's eventual murder by Kaijie, and Kaida's role in the eventual cover-up, caused him great emotional stress, and drove him to a mental breakdown, which cost Kaida his medical practice, and his girlfriend, Shimin. After his mental breakdown, Kaida helped out Xiao Gu with her restaurant operations, but he did little in his line of work, and spent much time watching television (just as Jinfeng did when she was helping out Xiao Gu).
Kaijie.
Kaijie is the main villain in the series. Cunning but financially inclined, he became a lawyer, despite neglecting his academic studies during his youth. He despised the Jins, as he believed Ah Jin's criminal past brought shame to the Huangs. In the subsequent years, he made a small fortune in financial and property transactions, and eventually bought an apartment flat, which he used to house Jinfeng when she escaped from the Huangs. Jinfeng and Kaijie eventually developed an affair, and Jinfeng was made pregnant by Kaijie. Desperate to hide this hideous fact, and determined to gain the love and trust of Lin Fei (who comes from a wealthy family), he pushed Jinfeng overboard during a yacht trip. Jinfeng fell into a coma and eventually succumbed to her injuries.
Kaiqi.
Kaiqi is the youngest member of the Huang family. A justice-minded individual since her youth, she eventually became a broadcast journalist. She is the only person in her family (perhaps beside Kaida) who can get through to the hotheaded and stubborn Jinlong. Despite her unlucky streak in romance during her University days, she eventually married David (portrayed by Nat Ho), who is a dentist.
Jin Family.
Ah Jin.
The personal history of Ah Jin is not well known, although he claims he is a sailor, which means he is away from his family for long periods of time. However, the claim is fake, as Ah Jin is actually a robber who participated in the largest jewelry store since Singaporean Independence. His accomplices also killed a few police officers, as well as a gravely injured accomplice. Ah Jin, as well as the surviving accomplice, buried the jewelry obtained from the heist in an undisclosed location and went into hiding, as arrest would almost certainly mean death (Singaporean law allows Death Penalty). He saved Xiao Gu from almost certain death, and the two grew close together after Ah Jin moved into Xiao Gu's apartment complex. When the two decided to get married, Kaijie, determined not to allow Ah Jin to do so, dug up Ah Jin's criminal past, and tipped off his whereabouts to police. When Ah Jin was surrounded by police, he committed suicide, rather than letting the police arrest him. However, before he died, he told Xiao Gu the whereabouts of the stashed jewelry, which allowed Xiao Gu to dig up the jewelry and eventually use them to finance her business.

Links of Noltland

Links of Noltland is an archaeological site near Grobust Bay on the north coast of Westray in Orkney, Scotland. The site contains the remains of both a Neolithic village and later Bronze Age dwellings.
Excavations at the site () in the 1980s found a Neolithic building, which is now in the care of Historic Scotland who are funding further excavation. In 2009 the Westray Wife was discovered, a lozenge-shaped figurine that is believed to be the earliest representation of a human face ever found in Scotland. The face has two dots for eyes, heavy brows and an oblong nose and a pattern of hatches on the body could represent clothing. Archaeologist Richard Strachan described it at the time as a find of "astonishing rarity". Two further figurines were subsequently found at the site, one in 2010 and the other in 2012, a situation described as "unprecedented" by Culture Minister Fiona Hyslop.
There may have been several phases of occupation, as the first figurine was probably carved 2500 - 3000 BCE and one structure has been dated to c. 2000 BCE. Other finds include polished bone beads, tools, and grooved ware pottery. The full extent of the site is believed to exceed the size of Skara Brae on the Orkney mainland. The ruins are being backfilled to protect them from winter storms.
Another 2009 discovery is that of a large building for collective use described as a "village hall". The structure overlooks the main settlement and would have been about wide and had walls thick. Other finds are revealing a remarkably detailed picture of life in the settlement over a long period of time spanning the Neolithic and early Bronze Age. It is clear that the residents farmed crops such as barley, kept livestock such as cattle and sheep and were partial to venison.
Nearby are Queen o' Howe broch, The Lum Head chambered tomb and the ruins of Noltland Castle.

Charles Waddington (East India Company officer)

Charles Waddington CB (24 October 1796 – 22 November 1858) was a major-general in the Bombay Engineers of the British East India Company.
Family and education.
Charles Waddington was born at 124 Sloane Street, Brompton, London, on 24 October 1796. He was the fifth son of William Waddington of Walkeringham, Nottinghamshire, by his wife, Grace Valentine, daughter of Henry Sykes of London. He was educated at the East India Company's Addiscombe Military Seminary from 1811 to 1812.
Career.
Waddington received his commission as a second lieutenant in the Bombay Engineers on 3 April 1813, and arrived in India on 22 May 1814. He accompanied Colonel Kennedy’s force to the Concan, and his services at the assaults of Madanghar (eighty miles south-east of Bombay) and of Jamba were favourably mentioned. Towards the end of 1819 he went home on leave, was promoted to be lieutenant on 16 November 1820, married in 1822, and on his return to India in 1823 acted as executive engineer at Baroda. He was promoted to captain on 29 July 1825, and appointed in October executive engineer of the Baroda subsidiary force. In November 1827 he was moved to Bombay as civil engineer at the presidency, and in August 1828 acted also as superintending engineer. He was appointed to the command of the engineer corps and to take charge of the Engineer Institution in October 1830. In September 1834 he commanded the engineers at Sirur, returning to the presidency as superintending engineer in January 1835.
On 28 June 1838 Waddington was promoted to be major, and in May of the following year was appointed superintending engineer of the southern provinces. In September 1841 he went to Sind as commanding engineer. He accompanied Major-general (afterwards Sir) Richard England in his march through the Bolan Pass in the autumn of 1842, and was favourably mentioned in England’s dispatch of 10 October 1842 for his services at Haikalzai. On 4 November 1842 he was appointed command engineer in Baluchistan as well as Sind. He accompanied Sir Charles Napier as commanding engineer of his force in the celebrated march of eighty-two miles from Dijikote on 6 January 1843 to Imamghar, where they arrived on 12 January. Instructed to demolish the fort, Wadding fired his mines on 15 January. He himself lit the fuses of three mines, and was bending over the train of one when his assistant called upon him to run as the other mines were about to explode. But he deliberately insured that the fuse was well alight before he walked away amid a storm of bursting mines. Napier mentioned him in his dispatch of 22 January 1843 for his gallantry. He called it a grand action, but advised Waddington that he would have done better to appreciate his own worth and reserve his heroism for an occasion where it might turn the crisis of a war.
Waddington took part in the Battle of Miani on 17 February 1843, where he acted as aide-de-camp to Napier and was mentioned in dispatches. He was also at the Battle of Hyderabad, or Dubba, on 24 March, when Napier again mentioned him as having 'rendered the most important aid in examining the enemy's position with that cool courage which he possesses in so eminent degree' ). On 4 July he received the medal for Miani and Hyderabad and was appointed a Commander of the military division of the Order of the Bath and also promoted to lieutenant-colonel.
After a period of leave in England, Waddington was employed in special duty at Puna until October 1847, where he was appointed superintending and executive engineer at Aden, altered to chief engineer in April 1851, the court of directors desiring that 'their high approbation of his valuable services be conveyed to this zealous and able officer' (30 July 1851). He was promoted to colonel on 24 Nov. 1853 and major-general on 28 November 1854. On 4 May 1854 he was appointed chief engineer in the public works department, Bombay, and his services in making the preparation for the Persian expedition received official acknowledgement on 3 Dec. 1856. In November 1857 Waddington was appointed to the command in Sind. In September 1858 he was compelled by ill-health to leave India, and he died in London on 22 November of that year.
Personal life.
In 1822 Waddington married Anne Rebecca, daughter of John Pinchard of Taunton, Somerset; and by her he left a family of six sons and two daughters. His eldest son, William (b. 1823), colonel Bombay Staff Corps, served in Persia (medal and clasp) 1856-1857, and became J.P. for Wiltshire. Another son, Thomas (b. 1827), became major-general of the Bombay Staff Corps.
Publications.
Waddington contributed several papers to the "Professional Papers of the Corps of Royal Engineers", including:

Thrasyvoulos Tsakalotos

Thrasyvoulos Tsakalotos (, 3 April 1897, Preveza, Ottoman Empire – 15 August 1989, Athens), was a Hellenic Army officer who served in World War I, the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922 and World War II, rising to become Chief of the Hellenic Army General Staff.
Tsakalotos was born in Preveza in 1897. He entered the Hellenic Army Academy in 1913 and graduated from it as an Infantry 2nd Lieutenant in 1916. He fought at the Macedonian Front of World War I as well as in Anatolia against the Turks, being promoted to Lieutenant in 1917 and Captain in 1920.

Following the Metapolitefsi of 1974, Tsakalotos became a supporter of Andreas Papandreou and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK); in the elections of 1985 he published a statement encouraging people to vote for PASOK and saying that he felt Andreas was like a brother to him. (Avriani, May 1985) 
On 23 March 1984, as a symbolic gesture of reconciliation and healing of the divisions caused by the Civil War, Tsakalotos publicly met and shook hands with his erstwhile adversary, Markos Vafiades, the commander of the Communist forces. 
Thrasyvoulos Tsakalotos died in Athens on 15 August 1989.

<doc id="19299058" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19299058" title="William Welwod">
William Welwod

William Welwod (1578–1622) was a Scottish jurist who was the first to formulate the laws of the sea in an insular Germanic language.
He was a professor of civil law at the University of St Andrews until 1611, when he resigned his chair and moved to England.
Works.
Welwod is primarily known for his writings opposing Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius' concept of "Mare Liberum" (the freedom of the seas), the idea that the seas and oceans were free for all to use and not the property of anyone. Welwod used Biblical texts to argue that in some cases nations could claim exclusive national rights over territorial waters.
Welwod wrote a Scots language treatise on the law of the sea, "The sea-law of Scotland", published in 1590 by Robert Waldegrave — 'the earliest book of maritime jurisprudence'. Welwod stated in the preface that the book was aimed at Scottish mariners and merchants. It was written in a vernacular style, and presented the sea law in the form of simple rules. Welwod later reworked "The sea-law of Scotland" into "An Abridgement of All Sea-Lawes" (1613), which included a chapter arguing against Hugo Grotius' "Mare Liberum". He later expanded this chapter, "Of the Community and Propriety of the Seas", into a full work entitled "De dominio maris" (1615).
Welwod's main concern was that Grotius' theories could be used to justify the large-scale herring fishing in Scottish waters by Dutch fleets which, according to Welwod, had caused a collapse in the fishing industry along the Scottish east coast.
Hugo Grotius responded to Welwod's critique by writing "Defensio capitis quinti Maris Liberi oppugnati a Gulielmo Welwodo" ("Defense of the five free oceans, opposed by William Welwod"). The work was written around 1615 but not published until 1872. In this work, Grotius complained that Welwod had misunderstood his treatise as an attempt to justify Dutch fishing in Scottish waters, when it was in fact primarily intended to argue for the Dutch right to trade with the East Indies.

Perowne Barracks

Perowne Barracks is a former British Army barracks in Hong Kong. It closed in 1994 following the drawdown of the military establishment prior to the handover of sovereignty in 1997. Formerly stationed at the barracks was a Gurkha regiment of the Royal Engineers. The barracks was named for Major General Lancelot Perowne (1902–82), the first Colonel of the Gurkha Engineers (unit of the Royal Engineers) and later Major General of the Brigade of Gurkhas. 
Since closure, part of the barracks has been used as a training school by the Hong Kong Immigration service, and another part is used by the Crossroads Foundation charity.
The majority of the camp has not been maintained since the army left. There is still a large Brigade of Gurkhas badge on a camp building - the secondary school - that can be seen from the Tuen Mun Highway which bisects the camp.
The land is gazetted by the Hong Kong government for redevelopment. It is not clear when any clearing of the site may occur.
The barracks was used until 2008 as the final checkpoint for the annual Trailwalker event along the MacLehose Trail. In 2009 the Trailwalker route changed to end in Yuen Long.
The slipway of that part of the barracks known as Gordon Hard divides Cafeteria Old Beach from Cafeteria New Beach in So Kwun Wat. There are still several Nissen huts in this area as of 2009.

Another source for his knowledge was the study of ancient geographical books he had access to, like the "Classic of Mountains and Seas" ("Shanhaijing") completed by the time of the early Western Han Dynasty) and the "Water Classic" ("Shuijing"), written by Sang Qin during the Three Kingdoms Period and later commentated on by Guo Pu. Li vastly expanded the "Water Classic", doing his own research and fieldwork. The original "Water Classic" has not survived but covered 127 rivers and streams and contained about 10,000 characters; Li Daoyuan's "Commentary on the Waterways Classic" (Shui Jing Zhu, discusses 1252 watercourses and contains about 300,000 characters in total. The book maps and describes the rivers and streams along with the history, geography and culture of the surrounding region.

Stab (b-boy move)

The stab is a breakdance technique necessary to perform many downrock and power moves. It is not a distinct move, but is incorporated into many breakdance moves including the turtle, cricket, jackhammer, crab-walk, hand glide, some versions of the windmill, and many other floats and freezes. It allows the breakdancer's entire weight to be supported by bony structures while expending minimal muscular energy to maintain balance. 
The stab is accomplished by placing the olecranon process of the elbow firmly against the bones or tensed muscles of the abdomen, side, or back. Perhaps the most basic stab places the elbow against the anterior superior iliac spine. Meanwhile, the hand is placed against the ground. The radius and ulna are held perpendicular to the ground with the weight of the body on either side of the point of contact kept in perfect balance. Assuming this balance is maintained, the rest of the body can then be suspended above the ground in any desired position.

Arms Trade Treaty

The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) is a multilateral treaty that regulates the international trade in conventional weapons, which has not entered into force. International weapons commerce has been estimated to reach US$70 billion a year.
The treaty was negotiated at a global conference under the auspices of the United Nations from July 2–27, 2012, in New York. As it was not possible to reach an agreement on a final text at that time, a new meeting for the conference was scheduled for March 18–28, 2013. On 2 April 2013, the UN General Assembly adopted the ATT. The treaty has been signed by 116 states, and has been ratified by 11. It will enter into force after it has been ratified or acceded to by 50 states.
Origins.
The roots of what is known today as the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) can be traced back to the late 1990s, when civil society actors and Nobel Peace Prize Laureates voiced their concerns about the unregulated nature of the global arms trade and its impact on human security.
The ATT is part of a larger global effort begun in 1997 by Costa Rican President and 1987 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Óscar Arias. In that year, Arias led a group of Nobel Peace Prize laureates in a meeting in New York to offer the world a code of conduct for the trade in arms. This group included Elie Wiesel, Betty Williams, the Dalai Lama, José Ramos-Horta, representatives of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, Amnesty International, and the American Friends Service Committee. The original idea was to establish ethical standards for the arms trade that would eventually be adopted by the international community. Over the following 16 years, the Arias Foundation for Peace & Human Progress has played an instrumental role in achieving approval of the treaty.
In 2001, the process continued with the adoption of a non-legally binding program of action at the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects in 2001. This program was formally called the “Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects” (PoA). 
Later put forward in 2003 by a group of Nobel Peace Laureates, the ATT was first addressed in the UN in December 2006 when the UN General Assembly adopted resolution 61/89 “Towards an Arms Trade Treaty: establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms”.
The arms trade treaty, like the PoA, is predicated upon a hypothesis that the illicit trade in small arms is a large and serious problem requiring global action through the UN. According to a well regarded 2012 Routledge Studies in Peace and Conflict Resolution publication, "the relative importance of diversion or misuse of officially authorised transfers, compared to international entirely illegal black market trafficking has been thoroughly confirmed." The authors go on to elaborate that "For most developing or fragile states, a combination of weak domestic regulation of authorised firearms possession with theft, loss or corrupt sale from official holdings tends to be a bigger source of weapons concern than illicit trafficking across borders."
Development of the treaty.
Resolution 61/89 requested the UN Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States on the feasibility, scope and draft parameters for a "comprehensive, legally binding instrument establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms", and to submit a report on the subject to the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. 94 States submitted their views, which are contained in the 2007 report A/62/278.
UN Resolution 61/89.
On 18 December 2006, UK Ambassador John Duncan formally introduced a resolution requested the UN Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States on the feasibility, scope and draft parameters for a "comprehensive, legally binding instrument establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms", speaking on behalf of the co-authors (Argentina, Australia, Costa Rica, Finland, France, Japan and Kenya). On behalf of the European Union, Finland highlighted the support for the effort when it said, “everyday, everywhere, people are affected by the side effects of irresponsible arms transfers... As there is currently no comprehensive internationally binding instrument available to provide an agreed regulator framework for this activity, the EU welcomes the growing support, in all parts of the world, for an ATT.”
In December 2006, 153 Member States voted in favor of the resolution, numbered 61/89. Twenty-four countries abstained: Bahrain, Belarus, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, Laos, Libya, Marshall Islands, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, UAE, Venezuela, Yemen, and Zimbabwe. The United States voted against the resolution.
Responding to procedural concerns that were not resolved before the final draft of the resolution, the UK said the aim of the initiative was to start a discussion on the feasibility and draft parameters of an Arms Trade Treaty and that "agnostic" states would have a clear opportunity to engage in the process. After the vote, Algeria indicated that the effort must receive broad-based support from states and be based on the principles of the UN Charter.
Group of Governmental Experts.
Resolution 61/89 also requested the Secretary-General to establish a group of governmental experts, on the basis of equitable geographical distribution, to examine the feasibility, scope and draft parameters for such a legal instrument, and to transmit the report of the group of experts to the Assembly for consideration at its sixty-third session. On 28 September 2007, the Secretary General appointed a Group of Governmental Experts from the following 28 countries: Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, Russian Federation, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Kingdom and United States. The group met three times in 2008 and published a final report on the issue
Preparatory Committee and Conference.
In 2009, Oscar Arias, then in his second term as President of Costa Rica, introduced the Treaty at the United Nations, saying:
“I return today, as a Rip Van Winkle of the modern era, to see that everything has changed except this. Peace continues to be a step further away. Nuclear and conventional weapons still exist despite the promises. It is up to us to ensure that in twenty years we do not awaken to the same terrors we suffer today. I am not ignorant of the fact that the biggest arms dealers in the world are represented here. But today I do not speak to the arms manufacturers, but rather to the leaders of humanity, who have the responsibility to put principles before profits, and enable the promise of a future in which, finally, we can sleep peacefully .”
In that same year, an Open-ended Working Group—open to all States—held two meetings on an arms trade treaty. A total of six sessions of this Group were planned. However, at the end of 2009 the General Assembly of the United Nations decided by resolution A/RES/64/48 to convene a Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty in 2012 "to elaborate a legally binding instrument on the highest possible common international standards for the transfer of conventional arms". The decisions was influenced by change in position of the United States (the largest arms producer and only country voting against resolution 61/89), which took place upon a change in leadership from George W. Bush to Obama, on the condition they were “under the rule of consensus decision-making needed to ensure that all countries can be held to standards that will actually improve the global situation.”
Adoption of the Treaty.
The UN General Assembly of 2 April 2013 (71st Plenary Meeting) adopted the Arms Trade Treaty as a resolution by a 154-to-3 vote with 23 abstentions. North Korea, Iran, and Syria voted in opposition. China and Russia, among the world's leaders in weapon exports, were among the 23 nations that abstained. Cuba, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan also abstained. Armenia, Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Vietnam did not vote. It was opened for formal signature on 3 June 2013.
Content.
The UN Office for Disarmament Affairs claimed the treaty would not: interfere with domestic arms commerce or the right to bear arms in its member states; ban the export of any type of weapon; harm the legitimate right to self-defence; or undermine national arms regulation standards already in place.
Advocates of the treaty say that it only pertains to international arms trade, and would have no effect on current domestic laws. These advocates point to the UN General Assembly resolution starting the process on the Arms Trade Treaty. The resolution explicitly states that it is “the exclusive right of States to regulate internal transfers of arms and national ownership, including through constitutional protections on private ownership.”
Criticism.
Opposition to the ATT can be broken down into state opposition and civil society opposition. Over thirty states have objected to various parts of the ATT during negotiations, the majority of which held strong concerns about the implications for national sovereignty. According to armstreaty.org, countries such as Cuba, Venezuela, Egypt, and Iran have objected to many more aspects of the ATT than has the United States.
From a civil society point of view, groups concerned about national sovereignty or individual rights to armed defense have been negative of the ATT. While not fundamentally opposed to an ATT, these groups are keenly sensitive to ensuring an ATT does not undermine national constitutional protections and individual rights. The most vocal and organized civil society groups opposing objectionable aspects to the ATT originated from the United States. These groups include the International Association for the Protection of Civilian Arms Rights (IAPCAR), the National Rifle Association (NRA), the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), and The Heritage Foundation. The NRA and the Gun Owners of America say that the treaty is an attempt to circumvent the Second Amendment and similar guarantees in state constitutions in order to impose domestic gun regulations.
One of the largest sources of civil opposition to the ATT has come from the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA), which is the lobbying arm of the NRA. In July 2012 ILA stated that:
On 12 July 2012, the United States issued a statement condemning the selection of Iran to serve as vice president of the conference. The statement called the move "outrageous" and noted that Iran is under Security Council sanctions for weapons proliferation.
Advocated contents.
International non-government and human rights organizations including Amnesty International, Oxfam, the Arias Foundation for Peace and Human Progress, Saferworld and the International Action Network on Small Arms (who lead the Control Arms Campaign) have developed analysis on what an effective Arms Trade Treaty would look like.
It would ensure that no transfer is permitted if there is substantial risk that it is likely to:
Loopholes would be minimized. It would include:
The Amnesty International website "loopholes" include shotguns marketed for deer hunting that are virtually the same as military/police shotguns and rifles marketed for long range target shooting that are virtually the same as military/police sniper rifles. AI advocates that the civilian guns must be included in any workable arms trade controls; otherwise, governments could authorize export/import of sporting guns virtually the same as military/police weapons in function. 
It must be workable and enforceable. It must:
NGOs are also advocating that the Arms Trade Treaty must reinforce existing responsibilities to assist survivors of armed violence, as well as identify new avenues to address suffering and trauma. 
The U.S. NGO Second Amendment Foundation has voiced concern that a multinational treaty limiting the firearms trade might infringe on the constitutional right of private firearm ownership for self-defense in the US and other countries.
Signatories.
As of November 2013, 115 states have signed the Treaty and eight have ratified it. The Treaty will enter into force 90 days after the date of the 50th ratification. Seven states have decided to provisionally apply articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty, pending its entry into force.

Te Mihi Power Station will use geothermal energy from the Wairakei geothermal field, which lies in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. It is planned to gradually replace the Wairakei Power Station which will be phased out of production. When Te Mihi is finished, output from Wairakei will decrease by approximately 45 MW, resulting in a net increase of about 114 MW.
The project was designed and constructed by a joint venture of McConnell Dowell, SNC-Lavalin and Parsons Brinckerhoff. The plant includes two 83 MW steam turbines supplied by Toshiba. The project was expected to cost $623 million and to be operational in 2013.

Rosendo Ruiz

Rosendo Ruiz Suárez (Santiago de Cuba 01 March 1885 – Havana, 1 January 1983) was one of the founders of the trova movement in Cuban music. He was originally a tailor, who became a singer, guitarist and composer. He lived for almost a century, during which time he had a great influence on the music of his country.
Of humble extraction, like Sindo Garay, he taught himself the guitar, but soon Pepe Sánchez gave him classes to improve his guitar technique and took him into a group of musicians who were brightening up fiestas for wealthy whites in the environs of Santiago de Cuba. Short of money, he moved first to Cienfuegos, then to Havana. His first success came in 1911 with "Mares y arenas" (Seas and sand); in 1919 came "Redención" (Redemption), a socialist anthem. In the 1930s he formed the Trio Azul who had a hit with "Bilongo" (a number also called "La negra Tomasa"; it was by one of the trio). Other famous pieces were "Confesión", "Naturaleza", "Junto a un canaveral", and the pregón "Se va el dulcerito".
He wrote a guitar manual which ran to several editions, and was a leader of the Trova Cubana Forum. His son, Rosendo Ruiz Quevedo, continued many of his interests, and was also a fine musician.

Bob Evans (16 February 1921 - 14 April 2003) was a Welsh rugby union flanker who played club rugby for Newport and county rugby for Monmouthshire. He played ten internationals for Wales, and was selected for the British Lions playing in all six tests of the 1950 tour of Australia and New Zealand.
Evans was a hard tackling flanker, but his skill was seen in his intelligent defensive positioning. He would often sit behind the three midfield players in offence to ensure that if passing movements broke down the opposition could not counterattack. He specialised in subduing fly-half play and would often disrupt opposing midfield trios into poor positions causing errors in play without even engaging them.
Rugby career.
Evans won a Welsh Secondary Schools cap while at Rhymney Secondary School, and after leaving school joined the Monmouthsire Police. In 1943 he joined the Royal Air Force and played rugby for several unit teams. After he was demobbed, he rejoined the police force and was elected captain of his local rugby club at Rhymney. He was invited to play for Newport against Swansea in 1945 in a game at St Helens, and joined the black and ambers that season.
On 22 March 1947, Evans was selected for Wales against France at Stade Colombes. Evans was a late substitute, replacing the injured Ossie Williams, and would represent Wales on ten occasions, scoring his one and only try during his second game, in a match against Ireland.

Wairakei Power Station

The Wairakei Power Station is a geothermal power station near the Wairakei Geothermal Field in New Zealand. Wairakei lies in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. 
History.
The power station was built in 1958, the first of its type (wet steam) in the world, and it is currently owned and operated by Contact Energy. A binary cycle power plant was constructed in 2005 to use lower-temperature steam that had already gone through the main plant. This increased the total capacity of the power station to 181MW. The Wairakei power station is due to be phased out from 2013, replaced by the Te Mihi geothermal power station. The Poihipi Power Station was built in 1996 at a nearby site in the same field.
Effects.
The use of steam from the field has had a number of visible effects on the local environment. Visible geothermal activity has increased (due to changes in the water table / water pressure allowing more steam to be created underground, upsurging at places like Craters of the Moon), while there has also been some land subsidence and reduction in steam volumes from the field after some decades of use. Recent total electrical production has been sustained or increased with the investment in additional power stations such as the binary plant of 2005 designed for lower-temperature generation, but the total still does not reach the early power levels such as the 192MW reported in 1965 (NZED Annual Statistics), for instance. Some power stations in the field are now capped in their extraction capacities and a substantial part of the water / steam is being reinjected after use. 
The hot geothermal fluid that is extracted is originally cold rainwater that had percolated downwards and been heated by hot rock; pumping back the warm water that emerges from the exhaust of the generator system thus reduces the heat drawn from the ground. Also, the Waikato river water is already too high in arsenic content to be safe to drink without special treatment, so reinjection of the facility's water does not exacerbate this problem.
Transmission.
Also at Wairakei is a major electrical substation, owned by the national grid operator Transpower. The substation is a major switching point for the Central North Island, and is responsible for connecting more than half the country's geothermal power stations, several hydroelectric power stations, the electricity supply to the entire Hawke's Bay and Gisborne regions and half of the Bay of Plenty region, as well as the local Taupo area.

He worked as a physician in Ljubljana and Vrhnika.
In June 2000, he was named as secretary at the Ministry of Health in the short-lived center right government of Andrej Bajuk. The same year, he was elected to the Slovenian National Assembly in the district of Vrhnika as a candidate of the Slovenian Democratic Party. He was re-elected in 2004.

Cukjati is well known for his advocacy against same-sex marriages, civil unions, and LGBT adoption. In a parliamentary debate, he has stated that homosexuality should not be considered as normal, but as a psychological problem that should receive treatment. Despite these opinions, Cukjati has supported the legalization of same sex civil unions that grant notably fewer rights than marriage, passed by the right wing parliamentary majority in 2005.

All Saints' Church, Hawton, is a parish church in the Church of England in Hawton, Nottinghamshire.
The church is Grade I listed by the Department for Culture, Media & Sport as a building of outstanding architectural or historic interest.
History.
The church is medieval and the chancel is described by Nikolaus Pevsner as "one of the most exciting pieces of architecture in the country.".
On the north side of the chancel is a medieval Easter Sepulchre. Opposite on the south side is the sedilia. The carvings on these two features are considered amongst the best in England.
The carvings in the chancel are thought to be the work of stonemasons who worked on the choir screen and Chapter House in Southwell Minster.
Easter Sepulchre.
Most famous is the Easter Sepulchre, which would have been used to reserve the consecrated bread and wine between Maundy Thursday and Easter Day, during which period there would have been no celebration of Holy Communion, and the consecrated elements would have been reserved in the Sepulchre. The carvings depict at the base the sleeping Roman soldiers guarding the tomb of Christ, at the top are the apostles gazing havenward at his ascending feet. In between is the risen Christ, the graveclothes draped over his shoulder. Sadly the glorious stonemasonry suffered at the hands of Oliver Cromwell's men.
Sedilia.
On the south wall of the chancel is the finely carved sedilia, originally provided for officiating clergy. At the very top are six saints standing on little men and animals, and crowned with angels. Lower are four female figures, then St Edward the Martyr, with a bishop on either side, and above are - on the left St Peter and, on the right St Nicholas. Further down still are two men on all fours gathering grapes among the foliage, and a pelican in her nest.

Cape No. 7

Cape No. 7 (; Japanese: 海角七号 (kaikaku nana gō)) is a 2008 Taiwanese romance comedic music-drama film written and directed by Wei Te-Sheng, his first full-length motion picture. The film is in Taiwanese and Mandarin Chinese with significant lines in Japanese. Before its commercial release, the film was world premiered on June 20, 2008 at the 2008 Taipei Film Festival as the opening film. The film later won 3 awards in this festival.
Prior to this film, the two leading actors Van Fan and Chie Tanaka only had minor acting experience while some of the supporting roles were filled by non-actors. Even without a strong promotional campaign, the film had become so popular in Taiwan that on November 1, 2008 it became the second highest grossing film in the country's cinematic history, behind James Cameron's "Titanic". The film has grossed over US$13,804,531 since its release.
The film has won 15 awards to date, including 6 at the 2008 Golden Horse Awards. It was also Taiwan's entry to compete in the 81st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, although it did not secure a nomination.
Plot.
In the 1940s near the end of the Japanese era of Taiwan, an unnamed teacher (Atari) dispatched to the southernmost town of Hengchun falls in love with a local girl with the Japanese name Kojima Tomoko (Liang). After the Surrender of Japan, the teacher is forced to return home as Taiwan was placed under the administrative control of the Republic of China. On his trip home, he pens seven love letters to express his regret for leaving Kojima Tomoko, who originally planned to elope with him to Japan. 
More than 60 years later, Aga (Fan), a struggling young rock band singer leaves Taipei to return to his hometown of Hengchun. There, his step father (Ma), the Town Council Representative, arranges a position for him as a postman, replacing the aging Old Mao (C. Lin), on leave after a motorcycle accident broke his leg. One day, Aga comes across an undeliverable piece of mail that was supposed to be returned to the sender in Japan; the daughter of the now deceased Japanese teacher had decided to mail the unsent love letters to Taiwan after discovering them. Aga unlawfully keeps and opens the package to discover its contents, but the old Japanese-style address "Cape No. 7, Kōshun District, Takao Prefecture" can no longer be found. 
Meantime a local resort hotel in nearby Kenting National Park is organizing a beach concert featuring Japanese pop singer Kousuke Atari, but Aga's step father makes use of his official position to insist that the opening band be composed of locals. Tomoko (Tanaka), an over-the-hill Mandarin-speaking Japanese fashion model dispatched to Hengchun, is assigned the difficult task of managing this hastily assembled band, led by Aga along with six other locals of rather particular backgrounds. After a frustrating trial period, Aga and Tomoko unexpectedly begin a relationship. With some assistance from hotel maid Mingchu (S. Lin), who is revealed to be Kojima Tomoko's granddaughter, Tomoko helps Aga find the rightful recipient of the seven love letters. Tomoko then tells Aga that she plans on returning to Japan after the concert because of a job offer. After returning the seven love letters, a heartbroken but determined Aga returns to the beach resort and performs a highly successful concert with his local band alongside Kousuke Atari while Kojima Tomoko reads the letters.
Filming.
The inspiration for "Cape No. 7" came in July 2004 when director Wei read a report about a Yunlin postman who successfully delivered a piece of mail addressed in the old Japanese style - the sender was the former Japanese employer of the recipient. Wei decided to make a film based on this story, in the hopes of financing his long-awaited epic film "Seediq Bale", which had problems securing financial interest.
By the end of 2006 Wei had finished "Cape No. 7"'s script. He was subsequently awarded NT$ 5 million for winning the "Domestic Film Fund" from Taiwan's Government Information Office. Wei said he picked Hengchun as the film's setting due to its richness in contrasts: mountains along with beaches; the old towns near the modern resort hotels; the aging population with the young working in Taipei; the diversified demographics with Hoklo, Hakka, Mainlanders, Taiwanese aborigines, and international tourists; the weather variation between the tropical southern Taiwan and the snow-laden Japan. Wei believed that such a setting would provide the ideal backdrop for the "harmony in diversity" theme of "Cape No. 7".
The movie was filmed between September and November 2007 in Hengchun and its neighboring Checheng and Manjhou Townships, located on the Hengchun Peninsula of Pingtung County. The set for the 'Hotel Chateau' (where the concert is held and at which model Tomoko stays) was the real life Château Beach Resort at Kenting. A few scenes were also filmed in Fangliao Township and Jiadong Township of Pingtung County, Kaohsiung International Airport, Ximending and Wenshan District in Taipei. The final scene presenting the Japanese teacher (Kousuke Atari) and other Japanese people leaving Taiwan by ship was filmed in an abandoned brewery in Taichung with more than 500 extras. Before filming, Chie Tanaka had been staying in Taiwan for 15 months to study Chinese so she did not have major problems dealing with the Chinese lines in the film. Kousuke Atari played himself and as the 1940s Japanese teacher in this film.
As the production went over budget, Wei had problems securing additional capital; he subsequently refinanced his home and forced his family NT$ 30 million (approx. $900,000 USD) into debt before release. Cast members Pei-Chen Lee and Chin-Yen Chang revealed that during filming Wei could barely afford the film rolls and lodging for the crew. Wei later said this film's zealous reception should help him manage his debts.
Wei believed "that the films that hit the screens before the end of summer vacation in 2007 were all 'safe bets'", because they avoided competition from Hollywood blockbusters. Wei followed this theory when he released "Cape No. 7" in 2008. Besides, Wei focused on the promotion of the film. The film was premiered in July, 2008, and attracted the interest of Buena Vista International, which made 50 copies of the film and distributed them nationally in August.
The film's 133 minute theatrical version was edited from the first cut of 160 minutes. Aga and Tomoko's love scene was shortened, and some of their dialog before the love scene was cut as well. The final version was shortened in Mainland China after the government film agency snipped out over half an hour of the film for political purposes. Nevertheless, rampant piracy in Mainland China saw the unedited version mass distributed via street stalls and the internet.
The film's marketing is combined with extensive merchandise, including original soundtrack CD, books, novelization, accessories, tours and musical concerts. The film contributed tourism for Hengchun, and especially boosted 'Hotel Chateau'. A televised concert was held with actors performing some numbers in the movie.
Reception.
Taiwan.
Although the film only attracted moderate box-office success during its first weeks of release, it was helped by strong word of mouth buzz, mainly in blogs and on the Professional Technology Temple (PTT) Bulletin Board System, eventually leading to its record-breaking box-office performance. 
Robert Chen, an assistant professor in the Department of Radio and Television at National Chengchi University, suggests that the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike may have reduced competition and that the distributor avoided a direct scheduling confrontation with "The Dark Knight".
Critics attribute the film's box office success to its honest depiction of the rural southern Taiwan; the strong emotional resonance among older viewers; the humorous tone, optimistic characters, and musical performances.
International.
The film gathered widespread attention at the 2008 Pusan International Film Festival where its broadcasting rights were successfully sold to Hong Kong; South Korea; Malaysia and Brunei, through Astro Entertainment Sdn Bhd and All Asia Multimedia Network, both subsidiaries of Malaysian pay-TV group Astro All Asia Networks; and Singapore. The Hong Kong release date was on November 20, 2008 and the film ranked first during its first week of release. Local critics found this film "civil, humorous, and friendly". The Singapore release date was originally January 1, 2009 but distributors decided to release this film earlier on November 27, 2008 so as to satisfy demand from Singaporeans and to fight piracy. The film made its United States premiere on October 10, 2008 in Honolulu at the Hawaii International Film Festival, where it won the Halekulani Golden Orchid Award for Best Narrative. Its premiere in the Continental United States was on December 12, 2008 in Los Angeles.
Profit Sharing.
Teng Sue-feng used the film to discuss how film profit is shared in Taiwan. Teng estimates the revenue from the movie to be NTD 520 million, and the production cost to be NTD 50 million. After the deducting the production costs, 60% of the profit goes to movie theaters, 10% to the distributor. The director gets 10%, which is about NT$140 million. 
Soundtrack.
"Cape No. 7"'s soundtrack was released on October 24, 2008 by the local Forward Music Corporation, Van Fan's then agency.
For an unspecified reason this soundtrack does not include the film's ending theme, "Beautiful Scenery" sung by Rachel Liang. This omission gave some fans reason to boycott this soundtrack.
DVD/BD release.
On November 14, 2008, Cape No. 7's distributors announced that the film's official DVD/BD release date will be December 19, 2008. On November 30, 2008 the number of copies ordered in advance had reached 23,000, far surpassing the runner-up record holder in Taiwan's cinematic history, "The Lion King"'s 12,000 reservations in 1995.

The church is Grade I listed by the Department for Culture, Media & Sport as a building of outstanding architectural or historic interest.
History.
The Church of St. Peter at Farndon "was erected during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and...it consists of chancel, nave with clerestory, a south aisle with an arcade of three bays, a western square tower containing four bells, and with an entrance porch. Portions of Saxon work, perhaps belonging to the first church, are to be found built in the north wall of the nave; the second church is represented by the columns and arches of the south aisle; while the third and present church is chiefly built in the Perpendicular style. The font is an Early English one. The date on the nave roof, which is well constructed, is 1664, and there are two stained glass windows of some merit, one on the south side of the chancel and the other in the aisle. Much interest was taken in an ancient sword, thought to be Saxon, and measuring 2 ft 4 ins (72 cm) long, which was discovered when excavating under the present church in October, 1892. This ""Viking sword from Farndon Church,"" is now preserved in the church vestry." and the sword is illustrated in David Kaye's ""History of Nottinghamshire."" Also, in recent years, the four church bells have been augmented to six and re-hung.
St. Peter's church is located at the extreme southwest of the village proper. An 1884 map of Farndon can be seen An aerial photo of Farndon Harbour can be seen

Greeks in the Czech Republic

There is a small community of Greeks in the Czech Republic. The Greek presence in the Czech Republic is dated to the 20th century. Roughly 12,000 Greek citizens who fled from the 1946-1949 Greek Civil War were admitted to Czechoslovakia.
Migration history.
The admission of Greeks to Czechoslovakia was facilitated by members of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) living in exile in Bucharest, Romania. Though they initially expected that they would soon return to Greece, due to the development of the political situation they could predict no definite end to their stay in Czechoslovakia. As a result, many eventually naturalised as Czechoslovak citizens and generally assimilated, often intermarrying with local Czechs or the small but significant minority of Sudeten Germans allowed to remain in Czechoslovakia following its liberation from Nazi German occupation. In many cases, these Greek refugees were resettled in houses which had formerly been owned by Sudeten Germans and were left unoccupied following the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. Most were concentrated in or around the towns of Brno (Brünn in German), Ostrava, Opava, and Krnov (Jägendorf in German) in southern Silesia, where Greek farming expertise helped revive agricultural production on lands formerly worked by ethnic Germans. About 5,200 of the migrants consisted of unaccompanied children. The migrants were ethnically heterogeneous, consisting not just of Greeks (mainly Greek Macedonians and Pontic Greeks) and Slav-Macedonians, but Aromanians, Sephardi Jews, and a few Turkish-speaking Asia Minor Greeks. 
Beginning in 1975, shortly after the overthrow of the Colonels' dictatorship and a programme of political liberalisation in Greece which led to the legalisation of the KKE, several thousand young Greeks, including those born in Czechoslovakia, emigrated to Greece. Older Greeks followed them some years later, after an arrangement was made between the Greek and Czechoslovak governments for them to receive their pensions in Greece. By 1991, there were just 3,443 people in Czechoslovakia who declared Greek ethnicity; almost all of those were in the Czech portion of the country, with just 65 in the Slovak portion. However, many of those who did emigrate to (mainly northern) Greece continued to retain strong links with the Czech Republic, with a few even using their dual Greek-Czech national identitities and contacts to help establish trade links between the two countries.
Language.
In their early days in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, ethnic Greek Macedonian and Slav Macedonian migrants used Greek as their natural lingua franca; however in orphanages which housed unaccompanied child migrants, it was not uncommon for ethnic Greek children to become receptively bilingual in the Macedonian language spoken by their playmates. In later years, locally born members of the community showed increasing language shift towards Czech, and tended to have a somewhat weaker command of Greek. However, this may also have been a natural consequence of several factors, including: intermarriage with Czechs and Sudeten Germans, the communist Czechoslovak education system's emphasis on Russian as a second language at the expense of providing for minority-language education, and even the fact many ethnic Greek Macedonians residing in Czechoslovakia were actually of Pontic Greek descent and so somewhat more comfortable with the Pontic Greek dialect rather than the Standard (Demotic) Greek used by the majority of Greek speakers. (Pontic Greek is an archaic Greek dialect (originally spoken by ethnic Greeks from northeastern Turkey and the Russian Caucasus) considered by some to be the closest living relative to Classical Greek but whose vocabulary and pronunciation diverge quite significantly in places from Modern Greek as a result of later exposure to Russian, Georgian, and Turkish linguistic influence.) Although a poor command of Modern Greek was previously often evident among the grandchildren of Greek refugees born in the 1980s and later, those from families who returned to Greece from the mid-70s have now been fully re-assimilated into Greek society and the Modern Greek education system. In fact, their multi-lingual background has enabled ethnic Greeks from Czechoslovakia (and elsewhere in the former Soviet Bloc) to develop and exploit a marked facility in foreign language learning and communication.

Harzfeld's

Harzfeld's was a Kansas City, Missouri-based department store chain specializing in women's and children's high-end apparel.
History.
The company was founded in 1891, as "Parisian Cloak Company" by Siegmund Harzfeld and partner Ferdinand Siegel. Harzfeld served as president until succeeded by Ferdinand Siegel's son, Lester Siegel, Sr. In February 1966, Lester Siegel, Jr. began serving as the company's third president 
In 1959, Harzfeld's went public, with its common shares traded on the local over-the-counter stock exchange. In 1972, the chain was acquired for $3 million by the retail conglomerate Garfinckel, Brooks Brothers, Miller & Rhoads, Inc. With the 1981, acquisition of its parent conglomerate, it became a part of Allied Stores. In 1984, the chain was closed.
Flagship store.
The original location of the Parisian Cloak Company was at 1108 and 1110 Main Street, Kansas City, Missouri. In 1913, the store moved to Main Street and Petticoat Lane and its name was changed to Harzfeld's. The new flagship was designed by noted architect John McKecknie as an office building. The store eventually expanded into an adjoining building, thereby extending its reach from Main to Walnut Streets. After closing in 1984, the flagship was integrated into the Town Pavilion complex. 
The store was renowned for a 1947 mural commissioned by the store and painted by Thomas Hart Benton. After the store closure, the mural, known as "Achelous and Hercules", was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution's American Art Museum in Washington, D.C..

On April 10, 1954, Harzfeld's opened its first branch in Kansas City at Country Club Plaza. In 1958, a second branch was opened in the Blue Ridge Mall shopping center. Further expansion occurred in 1963 with the opening of the Corinth Square store. A fifth store in greater Kansas City was opened in the Metcalf South shopping center in 1967. Shortly after its parent conglomerate acquired two Gus Meyer locations in Oklahoma in 1974, it converted them to Harzfeld's.

Carol Adams is a local government representative from Western Australia.
Currently the mayor of the City of Kwinana, she ran as an independent in the 2008 state election in the newly formed Electoral district of Kwinana. Adams also works as a solicitor for the Western Australian Police Union. 
Prior to the election, she had twice sought pre-selection to stand as a Labor candidate, but was overlooked in favour of Roger Cook, a former state party secretary and state manager of public relations firm CPR which is closely associated with the party. A smear campaign against her by Dave Kelly, State secretary of the Liquor Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers' Union had been waged in the last week of the election campaign.
While she initially appeared to have narrowly won the seat, further counting revealed she had in fact lost by 300 votes to the Labor candidate Roger Cook. If elected, Adams had been expected to take up the position of Speaker.
In local government, Adams was first elected to the Kwinana Town Council in 1997 and as mayor in 2006. In May 2007 she launched a council backed project called "Looking Forward", aimed at attracting $11.5 billion in private and government sector investment in the next 15 years.

Clipper Victor was a Boeing 747-121 which began service with Pan American World Airways in 1970. It was the first Boeing 747 to operate a scheduled commercial service and is notable for its brief but significant history.
The aircraft's tail number was N736PA, and "Clipper Victor" was its original name. Renamed "Clipper Young America," N736PA was the first Boeing 747 to make a commercial flight, flying from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to London Heathrow Airport, after the planned aircraft (originally also named "Clipper Young America") developed a mechanical problem.
In its first year of service, N736PA also became the first 747 to be hijacked, when it was flown to Cuba on August 2, 1970. Following this incident, the aircraft's name was changed back to "Clipper Victor".
On March 27, 1977, "Clipper Victor" was destroyed in the world's deadliest aviation accident, the Tenerife airport disaster, when a KLM Boeing 747 attempted to take off at Los Rodeos Airport, Tenerife, Canary Islands without clearance from the airport's air traffic controllers and collided with "Clipper Victor" on the runway.

Antennaria racemosa

Antennaria racemosa is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family known by the common name raceme pussytoes. It is native to western North America from British Columbia and Alberta to northern California to Wyoming. It grows in mountain forests, generally in moist, partially shaded areas, and often colonizes bare patches of mineral-rich soil, including disturbed areas. This is a glandular perennial herb which may be small, woolly, and matted to nearly hairless and erect to heights near half a meter. It forms basal patches of oval-shaped leaves 3 to 10 centimeters long, fuzzy on the undersides and shiny green above. The patches are connected with stolons covered in leaves. The erect stem bears an inflorescence which can be shaped like a raceme and is often dense, especially in higher elevations, containing several flower heads. The species is dioecious, with male and female plants producing different types of flowers in the heads. The fruit is an achene with a body only about a millimeter long attached to a soft pappus up to 7 millimeters long. The pappus catches the wind, which disperses the seed. The plant also reproduces vegetatively via its creeping stolons.

Shanghai Girls

Shanghai Girls is a 2009 novel by Lisa See. In an important sense, it returns to the beginning of her major writing career. After publishing three murder mysteries largely set in China ("Flower Net", "The Interior", and "Dragon Bones") and then following them up with two in-depth studies of the struggles of Chinese women in the 19th and 17th centuries respectively ("Snow Flower and the Secret Fan" and "Peony in Love"), See now returns to many of the themes she emphasized in her first major work, "On Gold Mountain". The 1937-57 time frame of the novel matches Parts IV and V of the memoir. The museum exhibit that See developed based on "On Gold Mountain" also provides relevant context for the new novel.
The novel received an Honorable Mention from the Asian/Pacific American Awards for Literature. The sequel, "Dreams of Joy", was released May 31, 2011.
Plot summary.
"Shanghai Girls" is divided into three parts: Fate, Fortune, and Destiny. It centers on the complex relationship between two sisters, Pearl and May, as they go through great pain and suffering in leaving war-torn Shanghai and try to adjust to the difficult roles of wives in arranged marriages and of Chinese immigrants to the U.S. Here See treats Chinese immigration from a personal view through Pearl's narration. In "On Gold Mountain" she objectively placed 100 years of her Chinese family history in the context of the daunting challenges Chinese immigrants faced in coming to America in search of Gold Mountain. America's mistreatment of Chinese immigrants is stressed in both memoir and novel.
The sisters' story is interrelated with critical historical events, famous people, and important places—the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Battle of Shanghai, internment at Angel Island, Los Angeles Chinatown, Hollywood, World War II, the Chinese Exclusion Act, McCarthyism, etc. Historically significant people appearing in the novel include Madame Chiang Kai-shek, actress Anna May Wong, film personality Tom Gubbins, and Christine Sterling, the "Mother of Olvera Street."
"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan" explores the complex relationship between two intimate friends. In "Shanghai Girls" See treats the loving yet conflicted relationship between two best friends who also happen to be sisters, especially in the context of their relationship to Pearl's daughter Joy. In speaking of "Shanghai Girls", See has commented: "Your sister is the one person who should stick by you and love you no matter what, but she’s also the one person who knows exactly where to drive the knife to hurt you the most." That being said, in "Shanghai Girls" it is the love of Pearl and May for each other that survives.
Characters.
The protagonist in the story. Her Zodiac sign is the Dragon. The elder of two sisters, she always thought that she was less loved by their parents because of her looks. She is in love with Z.G. Li, a painter/photographer who takes pictures of and paints Pearl and May. Although belonging to a wealthy family, she earns a small amount modelling with her sister, however, this is easily squandered off in her nightlife. She later marries Sam Louie to help pay off her father's debt to the Louies. She and Sam raise Joy, May's child as their own daughter. Later on she becomes pregnant with Sam's baby. She carries the baby to term, but the child is a stillborn boy.
Younger sister of Pearl. Her Zodiac sign is the Sheep. Flirtatious and haughty, she is jealous of her sister who went to college and who she thought was favored by their parents. She has a secret romantic relationship with Z.G. Li. Later it is discovered that she became pregnant by him, resulting in a daughter, Joy. May gives Joy to Pearl to raise as her own daughter because on the night of her wedding to Vern, Sam's brother, she could not bring herself to sleep with him. Father Louie (Vern and Sam's father) might suspect she is pregnant by someone else, so both she and Pearl pretend that Pearl was the one pregnant all along.

The Fugitive from Corinth is the 10th book in the popular Roman Mysteries series by Caroline Lawrence, published in 2005. It is set in Greece in AD 80, between Corinth and Athens. It focuses on the legends surrounding the Furies.
Plot summary.
Flavia and her friends have been travelling the Greek islands with other passengers aboard Lupus's ship, the "Delphina", captained by Flavia's father. They have rescued kidnapped children in the previous novel and now they relax for a while in her tutor Aristo's home city of Corinth.
But on the night before their departure, Aristo stabs Flavia's father in bed; feverish and suffering from amnesia, he falls into a deep coma. Helen witnessed Aristo's near-murder but has run off. Believing him guilty, Flavia, along with her friends and the sailor Atticus, sets off to catch him.
They save a young beggar boy, Nikos, and he provides information and, when everyone they ask describes Aristo in two different ways, he says that Aristo's brother Dion could be trying to catch him too. They find out that Nikos is actually a girl who lives beside Aristo's house in Corinth. She loves Dion. After asking a Pythia's advice about how to catch Aristo, which Flavia believes to be useless, Lupus sneaks into the temple to ask which temple his mother is in but is surprised to find out that the Pythia is his mother. He decides to leave her to help his friends. Nubia finds Aristo, and she believes his innocence. They arrive in Athens and chase up the Acropolis in which they lose him. They meet a beggar boy called Socrates and Flavia discovers Nubia is trying to stop them from catching Aristo. Jonathan storms off, Atticus is nowhere to be seen, and the 'two Aristos' (Dion and Aristo) descend into the Cave of The Kindly Ones (Furies). Nubia and Flavia follow, and Flavia locks them in. As they are dying they forgive each other, then Jonathan, Lupus and a priest let them out. Flavia eventually forgives Dion and they go back to Corinth to find that her father is still in a coma. Flavia has already asked the Pythia how to wake him up but she does not understand and ends up crying over his body. He wakes up, cured of his amnesia, and they realise that the Pythia's prophecy had come true.

First Class 8

The First Class 8 (FC8) is a One-Design keelboat designed in 1982 by Group Finot and Jacques Fouroux to be constructed at Beneteau's shipyard.
It's one of Europe's most competitive sailing classes, with more than 1,000 units sold between 1982 and 1994.
Strongest fleets are located in France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Germany, Norway and Portugal.
In recent years, it's being replaced by the new First Class 7.5. 
It is quite a long boat compared with its competitors such as the J24 from America. It has very straight lines for a boat of that age and has no reference to IOR hull shapes with huge beam, flared bows, and pinched sterns. Its lines lend itself to a dinghy style planing hull, as opposed to digging a hole in the ocean which was a characteristic of the mid period IOR boats. She has quite a lot of wetted surface area which makes her relatively slow in light air.
