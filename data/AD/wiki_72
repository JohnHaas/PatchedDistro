Toshiaki Nishioka

Early life and career.
Nishioka was born in Kakogawa, Hyōgo, Japan, in July 1976, and has one younger sister. He started boxing at age ten when he was in the fifth grade of elementary school on the recommendation of his father who runs a tavern. He compiled an amateur record of 10–2. Since before his professional debut, Nishioka had served as a sparring partner of the reigning WBC bantamweight champion Yasuei Yakushiji.
Nicknamed "Speed King", Nishioka won his professional debut by a first round knockout in Himeji, Hyōgo, on December 11, 1994. But he was knocked out in the fourth round of the next fight at the Korakuen Hall, and was carried out on a stretcher. Nishioka won the annual Japanese boxing series, West Japan Rookie King Tournament in the super bantamweight division at the Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium in September 1995. Winning over the Central Japan rookie king in the next fight at the Nagoya Civic Assembly Hall, he fought against the rookie king of the Western part of Japan in Fukuoka in December of the same year. Though Nishioka was convinced of his victory, the judges were in favor of his opponent.
During his early career, Nishioka was expected to be Joichiro Tatsuyoshi's successor, and served as his sparring partner for two years since 1996. Nishioka went down a weight division to capture the Japanese bantamweight title at the Osaka Municipal Central Gymnasium on December 29, 1998, the last day when Tatsuyoshi was a world champion. Although Nishioka was knocked down once when away from the clinch in the first round, he twice floored his opponent while wearing a confident and defiant smile in the second round to be crowned, and defended the title twice before returning it.
Rivalry and injuries.
In June 2000, Nishioka challenged the WBC bantamweight champion Veeraphol Nakonluang-Promotion in Takasago, Hyōgo, and lost via a unanimous decision. He had belonged to the JM Kakogawa Gym until that fight, and has been managed by the Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo under Akihiko Honda's supervision and Yūichi Kasai's guidance since September 2000.
The second world title shot was watched by 12,000 spectators at the Yokohama Arena in September 2001, and was a very close fight in which the scores were 115–113 for Nishioka, 116–113 for Veeraphol, and 114–114 even. Nishioka suffered an Achilles tendon rupture twice during that year. In December 2002, he returned to the ring for the first time in fifteen months to gain a first round knockout victory at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. However his style was totally different from the previous one. He challenged Veeraphol for the third time at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan in October 2003, but the result was a draw by a hometown decision. In his fourth world title shot against Veeraphol in March 2004, he lost via a unanimous decision by a wide margin of points at the Saitama Super Arena. 
After that defeat in 2004, Nishioka received a greeting card, with the Japanese message written by painter Atsumu Yamamoto; the phrase can be interpreted as: "No way to live other than this way", which encouraged him. While Honda advised him to retire, and set subsequent matches to convince him, Nishioka, who had remained aloof and proud as a boxer and had not trained with gym mates, decided to run with younger fellow boxers to strengthen his mind. He also attended Marco Antonio Barrera's training camp on the West Coast of the United States.
Marriage and recovery.
Nishioka got married in January 2005, and they have a daughter born in 2006. Nishioka went back to the super bantamweight division, and continued fighting mainly in Japan, besides a second round technical knockout victory at the Palais des Sports in Marseille, France, in April 2005, and a fourth round knockout victory (with a left-hand punch to the body) at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, in November 2006. Nishioka noticed that the former motion before the Achilles tendon injury came back in the pivot of his ankle from around the fight in November 2006. His trainer Kasai also felt that Nishioka's foot recovered to its original condition, and his thinking and fighting style progressed significantly from around the fight in December 2007 or in April 2008.
After the fight in December 2007, Nishioka stayed at his wife's parents' home in Amagasaki, Hyōgo. With the consent of his wife and her father, he decided to live separate from his wife and daughter to focus on boxing alone. When he returned to Tokyo and told Honda about it, he was told that the possibility that his fifth world title was determined to be less than ten percent and that he should bring her back immediately. The discomfort in his foot completely disappeared in the beginning of 2008. From that year, he is registered as a resident in Amagasaki where his own house has been completed in 2012. Usually, Nishioka trains while living a solo life in Tokyo, and his wife and daughter live in Amagasaki. After each of Nishioka's fights, he spends time together with his family in Amagasaki. Nishioka later recalled that transfer to the Teiken Boxing Gym and marriage have been his major turning points.
WBC super bantamweight title.
Nishioka captured the WBC super bantamweight interim title against Thai's Napapol Kiatisakchokchai at the Pacifico Yokohama on September 15, 2008. Just after the fight, Veeraphol whom he fought four times, and who served as Napapol's special coach, climbed into the ring to congratulate Nishioka. Nishioka inherited the fullversion of the WBC super bantamweight title on December 18 of that year, when its previous holder, Israel Vázquez, was stripped for medical reasons. He defended that title by knocking out Mexico's Genaro García in the final round, again at the Pacifico Yokohama on January 3, 2009. 
On May 23, 2009, Nishioka successfully defended his title against Jhonny González in front of 12,000 spectators mostly cheering for González at the Monterrey Arena in Mexico which had an outbreak of the H1N1 influenza. Nishioka recovered from a knockdown on the first round and went to knock out González in the third round. Nishioka's left blows including his left crosses have often been called "Monster Left" from those days. He succeeded in the third defense via a third round technical knockout (TKO) against Ivan Hernández at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium on October 10 of the same year. Nishioka was presented with the 2009 WBC Knockout of the Year. He defeated Filipino Balweg Bangoyan via a fifth round technical knockout at the Nippon Budokan on April 30, 2010 to have four consecutive title defenses all by knockout. The effects of trunk strengthening from the late 2009 have appeared, his balance has improved markedly. 
On October 24 of the same year, Nishioka fought a mandatory bout against Rendall Munroe at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan, and defeated him by a convincing unanimous decision to extend his defending streak to five matches. Nishioka strongly desired a unification match with the other organizations' champion especially after that. When Nishioka was named Japan's Fighter of the Year in 2010, he received a video message from Fernando Montiel demanding a fight at the awards ceremony in January 2011. Nishioka said he was willing to fight anytime soon afterward and his camp intended to arrange a match, but the contract was not finalized as Montiel lost to Nonito Donaire in February. On April 8, 2011, he knocked out Argentina's Mauricio Javier Muñoz in the ninth round in his sixth defense which was moved from the Ryōgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo to the World Memorial Hall in Kobe due to the Tōhoku earthquake.
In his seventh defense on October 1, 2011, Nishioka fought against Rafael Márquez, who had been marked as one of his targets from around October 2003, at the MGM Grand Marquee Ballroom in Las Vegas. Márquez's long, well-extended jabs were effective in the early rounds. At the end of four rounds, all three judges scored it identically at 39–37 in favor of Márquez. Nishioka fully concentrated every second from the beginning of the fight. He landed well-timed left and right blows while circling right to nullify Márquez's right cross, and although not in principle for a southpaw, often circling left to negate Márquez's left hook and to throw his quicker and sharper angled left, to win the bout by a unanimous decision. Although Márquez did not admit his defeat and demanded a rematch, there was no disgust nor booing among the spectators.
In March 2012, Nishioka competed with Yuriorkis Gamboa for "The Ring" pound for pound Top 10, and barely missed it. The WBC granted Nishioka the Emeritus Champion status on March 15, 2012.
Nishioka lost to Nonito Donaire by technical knockout in 1:54 in the ninth round at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California on October 13, 2012. He had been ranked the number one super bantamweight in the world by "The Ring", but was dropped to number three after the fight.
Retirement.
About a month following his bout with Donaire, Nishioka announced his retirement from boxing.

Thomas Lowson

Thomas Lowson (Scots: Tammas Lousen) (c1764–1856) is traditionally held to be the founder of the town of Carnoustie, Angus.
Biography.
It was along this new road that Thomas Lowson, a loom wright who lived in Barry, was returning home one day in 1797 from a trip to Inverpeffer. After passing the Point Inn, some say stopping there a while, he took a rest and slept for a while, and upon waking feeling especially refreshed, decided to approach the owner of the land, Major William Phillips, and ask to rent a small area of land. Phillips, the former valet of Panmure estate, bought Carnoustie estate from Bailie Milne in 1792 for the price of £5,000 on his return from India, renaming it 'Taymouth'. Phillips was surprised by Lowson's request, as the land was thought to be agronomically poor, but granted Lowson the first feu of of land for seventy shillings. On hearing about it, Phillips' wife took pity on the apparently deluded Lowson and refunded him five shillings. 
In 1798, while transplanting cabbage seedlings on his new land, Lowson left the willow dibble stick he had been using stuck in the ground. He later found it had sprouted leaves. The 'Dibble Tree', a magnificent specimen of Crack Willow (Salix fragilis) can still be seen, off Ferrier Street, and was listed as one of the hundred Treefest Heritage Trees of Scotland in 2006.
Lowson proved his detractors wrong and enjoyed so much success on his land in his first year that a number of his friends applied for feus in the following years. Carnoustie, as the town came to be known, grew over the next few decades such that there were more than a thousand inhabitants 50 years later. 
Lowson was married to Barbara Stewart. There is an entry on the Barry Parish Records for July 19, 1799 for the birth of his son, William, where the address is listed as 'Taymouth'. He can be seen on both the 1841 census, where his occupation is listed as 'carpenter', and the 1851 census, where he is listed simply as the 'First Ferth in Carnoustie'. Lowson died in 1856 at the age of 92, and was interred at Barry Parish Church cemetery. His original thatched cottage was improved extensively in the 19th century by his son William and can still be seen on the south side of Dundee Street, not far to the west of The Cross, where it still bears the name 'First Feu Cottage'.

<doc id="19327800" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19327800" title="Rai Italia">
Rai Italia

Rai Italia is the international television service of Rai Internazionale, a subsidiary of RAI, Italy's public national broadcaster. Rai Italia operates a television network that broadcasts around the world via 3 localized feeds. Programming features a mix of news, discussion-based programmes, drama and documentaries as well as sports coverage including 4 live games per week from Italy's top football league: the "Serie A".
Audience.
Rai Italia is targeted at Italian expatriates who live abroad, foreign citizens of Italian descent, and non-Italians interested in Italian language and culture; as such the network features a mix of the best programming from Rai as well as original programmes created especially for this channel.
Rai Italia started international television broadcasting in New Year's Day on 1992 as Rai International, Rai Italia has worked under an agreement with the Italian government in order to develop the presence of public service in international radio and television broadcasting. Rai Italia also strives to meet the demands for information and services from Italian communities abroad.
Rai Italia broadcasts three television channels, via satellite, which vary according to the different geographical targets. No service is available for Europe though Rai's domestic channels are widely available free-to-air in this region. Rai Italia has organized the satellite service into 3 zones with each having a different localized schedule:
In Europe, Rai Italia has broadcast for a short period timesharing with Rai Med (Arabic language entertainment, FTA), but this broadcast has ended. It also shares a cable TV channel with TV Guide Channel in the Boston, MA area on Comcast.
Controversy in Canada.
In Canada, Rai Italia's programming was originally seen on Telelatino, a Canadian licensed channel launched in 1984 and currently majority owned by Corus together with three prominent Italian-Canadians. Telelatino ( or "TLN") was launched over a decade before a RAI international TV channel ever existed. TLN had provided a level of availability and variety of Italian domestic and foreign programming to Canadians that was unsurpassed anywhere outside Italy.
However, in 2003, RAI pulled the Rai International programming from Telelatino and, with the help of Rogers Communications (which itself owns several multicultural stations in Toronto under the Omni Television system), petitioned the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to allow Rai Italia to be broadcast in Canada. Although the Italian community in Montreal was in favour of admitting Rai International into the Canadian media marketplace, the Italian community in Toronto was divided, since some believed that it was a ploy by the then Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to gain influence over Canadian Italian-language media. This theory may have been advanced by Telelatino's primary carriage of programming from Berlusconi-controlled Mediaset after RAI's Canadian launch.
Originally, the CRTC denied RAI's application, on the grounds that RAI had improperly denied supply of programming to TLN's Canadian viewers and that RAI's attempt to enter Canada on an unrestricted basis without any Canadian programming and financial obligations would be unfair competition. However, some Italian-Canadians could watch Rai Italia through grey-market satellite TV viewing cards that allowed them to watch US satellite television. Eventually, in 2005, the CRTC allowed Rai Italia to broadcast in Canada after a review of its policy on third-language foreign language TV services.

<doc id="19327804" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19327804" title="Orly Airport attack">
Orly Airport attack

The Orly Airport attack was the 15 July 1983 bombing of a Turkish Airlines check-in counter at Orly Airport in Paris, France, by the Armenian militant organization ASALA as part of its campaign for the recognition of and reparations for the Armenian Genocide. The explosion killed eight people and injured 55.
Attack.
The bomb exploded inside a suitcase at the Turkish Airlines check-in desk in the airport's south terminal, sending flames through the crowd of passengers checking in for a flight to Istanbul. The bomb consisted of a half kilo of Semtex explosive connected to three portable gas bottles (which explained the extensive burns on the victims).
Three people were killed immediately in the blast and another five died in hospital. Four of the victims were French, two were Turkish, one was American, and one was Swedish. The death toll made the Orly bombing the bloodiest attack in France since the end of the Algerian War in 1962. The dead included a French child, and a man with dual U.S.-Greek citizenship. The dual national was identified as Anthony Peter Schultze, who was studying in Paris and came to the airport to see off his Turkish fiancée. She was out of the check-in area when the bomb exploded, and was uninjured.
ASALA claimed responsibility for the attack.
French Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy came to the airport and condemned the attack, promising to find and punish the perpetrators. Later he visited the hospital where the most seriously injured were being treated. French President François Mitterrand visited some of the hospitalized victims and condemned the attack, calling it a "crime for crime's sake".
The Orly bombing came only five days before the second Armenian World Congress was due to open at Lausanne.
Investigation.
Shortly after the Orly blast, the French police arrested 51 suspected ASALA militants. According to the police, all the arrested came to France within one year and had been under surveillance by intelligence forces. The police confiscated weapons and explosives, including pistols and submachine guns. ASALA threatened with military attacks on the French interests around the world if "the French regime continues its method of terror and terrorism against the Armenian people". A few days after the French arrest of fifty-one Armenians in connection with the Orly bombing, ASALA bombed the Air France office and the French Embassy in Tehran, and threatened more attacks.
French police detained 29-year old Varoujan Garabedian (Varadjian Garbidjian), a Syrian national of Armenian extraction, who confessed to planting the bomb at the airport. Garabedian claimed he was the head of the French branch of ASALA. At the airport, Garabedian said he had too much luggage and gave a passenger $65 to check the bag for him. The bomb was intended to explode aboard a Turkish Airways plane en route from Paris to Istanbul, but it detonated prematurely on a baggage ramp.
Garabedian confessed that the bomb was assembled at the home of an Armenian of Turkish nationality, Ohannes Semerci, in Villiers-le-Bel. In Marseilles, police later arrested another Turkish citizen of Armenian extraction, 22 years old Nayir Soner, an electronics specialist who was suspected of assembling the bomb. 
French press alleged that the French Socialist government had struck a secret deal with ASALA in January 1982, in which there would be no further attacks on French soil in return for French recognition that the Turks had attempted genocide against the Armenians in 1915. Under the terms of the deal ASALA members supposedly were also granted unrestricted use of French airports, and four ASALA members charged with the takeover of the Turkish consulate in Paris, in which a security guard was killed, were given light sentences (seven years in jail). Garabedian told French investigators that the violation of the secret pact by ASALA was an accident, and that the suitcase bomb was supposed to detonate on board the Turkish airliner, not on French soil. But the Orly airport attack forced the French government to crack down on ASALA. 
Trial.
During an 11-day jury trial in suburban Créteil, Garabedian, defended by Jacques Vergès, denied his earlier confession. However, he was found guilty and on 3 March 1985 he was given a life sentence. Nayir Soner, accused of buying bottles of gas used to make the bomb, was given a 15-year sentence, and Ohannes Semerci, in whose apartment ammunition and dynamite were found, received a 10-year sentence. The victims were defended by Gide Loyrette Nouel: principal Jean Loyrette argued on terrorism in general and against claims of Armenian genocide; his collaborators Gilles de Poix and Christian de Thezillat argued on the attack itself, to demonstrate the guilt of the three defendants. Several Turkish scholars — Sina Aksin, Türkkaya Ataöv, Avedis Simon Hacinlyian, Hasan Köni, Mümtaz Soysal — testified for the prosecution during the trial.
In 1995, over 1 million people in Armenia signed a petition to the authorities in France calling for the release of Garabedian from prison.
In 2001, after 17 years in jail, Garabedian was released on the condition he was deported to Armenia. He was greeted by Prime Minister of Armenia Andranik Margaryan, who expressed happiness at Garabedian's release.
In an interview in 2008, Garabedian explained the Orly bombing was a protest against the hanging execution of Levon Ekmekjian in Istanbul in 1982, and he planned to destroy a Turkish Airlines plane, which was to transport high-ranking representatives of the Turkish secret services, as well as Turkish generals and diplomats. Garabedian claims that as a result of the attack 10 Turks were killed and 60 were injured.

History.
The Senior Scout section was first suggested by Baden-Powell in 1917, but it was soon replaced by Rover Scouts, before being restored as a section in the Boy Scouts Association in 1946.
In 1967, The Scout Association's Advance Part Report replaced Rover Scouts and Senior Scouts with the Venture Scout section. This was one of the factors that led to the formation of the Baden-Powell Scouts' Association.
Programme.
Promise.
The Senior Scout section uses the same Promise as other Scout sections of the Baden-Powell Scouts' Association.
Motto.
The motto of the Senior Scout section is "Look Wide".
Uniform.

Awards.
The Senior Scout awards include the Bushman's Thong, a leather braid made by the Scout and worn on their uniform, and top-level awards such as the St. George's Award. There are also a number of activity and skill badges which can be awarded to the young people upon meeting requirements in a variety of disciplines from horse-riding to first aid.

Laurence Baxter

Laurence Alan Baxter (28 February 1954, London – 8 November 1996, Long Island) was professor of statistics at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
Early life.
Baxter was born at the Bearstead Jewish Maternity Hospital, Stoke Newington. His family lived in Ilford, Essex. He was educated at University College London (UCL).
Career.
Baxter's first job (1975–1977) was at an insurance company. He then went to the Central Electricity Generating Board, where he researched ways to predict the available generator capacity given the incidence of breakdowns and the average time required for generator repairs. This work was accepted by UCL for a Ph.D. in 1980.
Baxter was then offered a temporary post as a lecturer at the University of Delaware. The following year, he moved to the State University of New York at Stony Brook (SUNY) where he was granted tenure about ten years before his death. 
Leitmann (1997) reports that "Baxter was internationally renowned for his work in applied probability
and reliability theory" and that he "published over 45 papers and did extensive consulting in this area". He further argues that the "results of his work on separately maintained components have been incorporated into a widely used AT&T Bell Laboratories software package for calculating various characteristics of system availability". Leitmann also notes that Baxter provided extensions to several classic theories in reliability theory naming these "continuum structure functions (CSFs)". Also that he researched air pollutions impact on mortality.
Baxter conceived the idea for and was Editor-in-chief of the book series "Stochastic Modeling", published by Chapman and Hall from 1993. He was an editorial board member for "Applied Probability Newsletter", "Bulletin of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics", the "Journal of Mathematical Analysis and its Applications", "Naval Research Logistics" and the "International Journal of Operations and Quantitative Management".
SUNY established the annual Laurence Baxter Memorial Lecture, which is now given each April at Stony Brook.

Tiger reserves of India

There are 53 tiger reserves in India (21-6-2011) which are governed by Project Tiger which is administered by the National Tiger Conservation Authority. There were an additional six proposed and four approved in principle reserves that are not yet declared. Assam was the place where this project was working since 1800 as a foundation PSH tiger
Goals.
The goals of declared reserves are operated by state forestry departments “to ensure maintenance of viable populations of the conservation dependent Bengal tigers in India. The tigers are maintained for their scientific, economic, aesthetic, cultural and ecological values and to preserve for all time areas of biological importance as a national heritage for the benefit, education and enjoyment of the people”.
The largest Tiger Reserve is the Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve of Andhra Pradesh.
Population assessment.
The landmark 2008 report, "Status of the Tigers, Co-predators, and Prey in India", published by the National Tiger Conservation Authority, estimated only 1411 adult tigers in existence in India (plus uncensused tigers in the Sundarbans).
The 2010 National Tiger Assessment estimated the total population of tigers in India as 1,706. This exhaustive study indicated that better protected tiger source sites, especially tiger reserves, have maintained viable tiger populations, however, the area occupied by tigers outside protected areas has decreased considerably. This demonstrates the need for securing corridors for tigers to move between source sites. The existing tiger reserves represent around one-third of India's high density forest area.
Management effectiveness.
From June, 2010 to July, 2011 the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in partnership with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) undertook an independent Management Effectiveness Evaluation (MEE) of all 39 tiger reserves in the country. The category-wise outcome of MEE Process is summarized as follows:

2008 Chatsworth train collision

The Chatsworth train collision occurred at 16:22 PDT (23:22 UTC) on Friday September 12, 2008, when a Union Pacific freight train and a Metrolink commuter train collided head-on in the Chatsworth district of Los Angeles, California. The scene of the accident was a curved section of single track on the Metrolink Ventura County Line just east of Stoney Point.
According to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which investigated the cause of the collision, the Metrolink train ran through a red signal before entering a section of single track where the opposing freight train had been given the right of way by the train dispatcher. The NTSB faulted the Metrolink train's engineer for the collision, concluding that he was distracted by text messages he was sending while on duty.
This mass casualty event brought a massive emergency response by both the city and county of Los Angeles, but the nature and extent of physical trauma taxed the available resources. Response included CEMP (California Emergency Mobile Patrol Search and Rescue) as a first responding unit requested by LAPD. With 25 deaths, this became the deadliest accident in Metrolink's history. Many survivors remained hospitalized for an extended period. Lawyers quickly began filing claims against Metrolink, and in total, they are expected to exceed a US$200 million liability limit set in 1997, portending the first legal challenges to that law. Issues surrounding this accident have also initiated and reinvigorated public debate on a range of topics including public relations, safety, and emergency management, which has also resulted in regulatory and legislative actions.
Collision.
Metrolink commuter train 111, consisting of a EMD F59PH locomotive (SCAX 855) pulling three Bombardier BiLevel Coaches, departed Union Station in downtown Los Angeles at 15:35 PDT (22:35 UTC) heading westbound to Moorpark in suburban Ventura County. Approximately 40 minutes later, it departed the Chatsworth station with 222 people aboard, and had traveled approximately when it collided head-on with an eastbound Union Pacific local freight train. The freight train was led by two SD70ACe locomotives, UP 8485 and 8491, weighing each, and was pulling 17 freight cars. The Metrolink locomotive telescoped rearward into the passenger compartment of the first passenger car and caught fire. All three locomotives, the leading Metrolink passenger car and ten freight cars, were derailed, and both lead locomotives and the passenger car fell over.
The collision occurred after the Metrolink passenger train engineer, 46-year-old Robert M. Sanchez, failed to obey a red stop signal that indicated it was not safe to proceed into the single track section. The train dispatcher's computer at a remote control center in Pomona did not display a warning prior to the accident according to the NTSB. Metrolink initially reported that the dispatcher tried in vain to contact the train crew to warn them; but the NTSB contradicted this report, saying the dispatcher noticed a problem only after the accident, and was notified by the passenger train's conductor first.
Both trains were moving toward each other at the time of the collision. At least one passenger on the Metrolink train reported seeing the freight train moments before impact, coming around the curve. The conductor of the passenger train, who was in the rear car and was injured in the accident, estimated that his train was traveling at before it suddenly came to a dead stop after the collision. The NTSB reported that it was traveling at . The freight was traveling at approximately the same speed after its engineer triggered the emergency air brake only two seconds before impact, while the Metrolink engineer never applied the brakes on his train.
Location.
The accident occurred after the freight train emerged from the 500-foot-long (150-meter-long) tunnel #28, just south of California State Route 118 near the intersection of Heather Lee Lane and Andora Avenue near Chatsworth Hills Academy. The accident was in Chatsworth, a neighborhood of Los Angeles located at the western edge of the San Fernando Valley. The trains collided on the Metrolink Ventura County Line, part of the Montalvo Cutoff, opened by the Southern Pacific Company on March 20, 1904, to improve the alignment of its Coast Line. Metrolink has operated the line since purchasing it in the 1990s from Southern Pacific (now owned by Union Pacific), which retained trackage rights for freight service.
Railroad physical characteristics.
Both trains were on the same section of single track that runs between the Chatsworth station (which is double tracked) through the Santa Susana Pass. The line returns to double track again as it enters the Simi Valley. Three tunnels under the pass are only wide enough to support a single track, and it would be very costly to widen them. This single track section carries 24 passenger trains and 12 freight trains each day.
The line's railway signaling system is designed to ensure that trains wait on the double track section while a train is proceeding in the other direction on the single track. The signal system was upgraded in the 1990s to support Metrolink commuter rail services, and Richard Stanger, the executive director of Metrolink in its early years of 1991 to 1998, said the system had functioned without trouble in the past. The Metrolink train would normally wait in the Chatsworth station for the daily Union Pacific freight train to pass before proceeding, unless the freight train was already waiting for it at Chatsworth. The location was not protected by catch points.
Timeline.
The events on September 12, 2008 leading up to the collision (all times local):
Aftermath.
Emergency response.
The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) originally dispatched a single engine company with a four person crew for a "possible physical rescue" at a residential address near the scene in response to a 9-1-1 emergency call from the home. The crew arrived at the address four minutes later, just before 16:30 PDT and accessed the scene by cutting through the backyard fence. Upon arrival, the captain on the scene immediately called for an additional five ambulances, then 30 fire engines, and after reaching the wreck he called for every heavy search and rescue unit in the city. Hundreds of emergency workers were eventually involved in the rescue and recovery efforts, including 250 firefighters. Two Los Angeles city firefighters received medals for risking their lives to enter a confined space with smokey and potentially toxic air, without their air bottles, to rescue one of the freight train engineers.
The event was operationally identified as the "Chatsworth Incident" and was reclassified as a "mass casualty incident." All six of LAFD's air ambulances were mobilized, along with six additional helicopters from the Los Angeles County Fire Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The helicopters were requested under a mutual aid arrangement.
A review of the emergency response and the on-site and hospital care was initiated by the Los Angeles County Supervisor immediately after the event, and was expected to take 90 days to complete.
Casualties.
A total of 25 people died in the collision, including engineer Sanchez and two victims who died at hospitals in the days following the crash. This event is the deadliest railway accident in Metrolink's history, and the worst in the United States since the Big Bayou Canot train disaster in 1993.
A total of 135 others were reported injured, 46 of them critically, with 85 of the injured transported to 13 hospitals and two transported themselves. Air ambulance helicopters medevaced 40 patients. LAFD Captain Steve Ruda reported that the high number of critically injured passengers taxed the area's emergency response capabilities, and patients were distributed to all 12 trauma centers in Los Angeles County. Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills treated 17 patients, more than any other hospital.
Captain Ruda said his firefighters had never seen such carnage. Austin Walbridge, a train passenger, told a TV news reporter that the interior of the train was "bloody, a mess. Just a disaster. It was horrible." Emergency responders described the victims as having crush type injuries. Dr. Amal K. Obaid, a trauma surgeon who practices at USC University Hospital where several victims were treated, described their injuries in more detail, "They have head injuries, multiple facial fractures, chest trauma, collapsed lungs, rib fractures, pelvic fractures, leg and arm fractures, cuts in the skin and soft tissue. Some have blood in the brain."
The Los Angeles County Coroner set up an air-conditioned tent that functioned as a temporary morgue at the site. One off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer was among the confirmed deaths, as was the Metrolink train's engineer,
an employee of Veolia Transportation, a contracted operator of Metrolink.
One of the passengers who died was a survivor of the 2005 Glendale train crash.
Another had been commuting by train since Metrolink's inception in 1992.
Many victims were residents of suburban Simi Valley and Moorpark on their way home from work in the Los Angeles area.
The four other crew members of the two trains survived.
The conductor and engineer of the freight train were trapped inside the lead locomotive while it was engulfed in flames; the firefighters who rescued the pair found them banging on the thick glass windshield, unable to escape. The freight crew also had a brakeman riding in the second locomotive who was injured in the crash.
The search for victims came to an end shortly after 14:30 PDT on September 13, approximately 22 hours after the collision.
Service disruptions.
The crash disrupted service on the "Pacific Surfliner" and the "Coast Starlight". Amtrak canceled service on the "Pacific Surfliner" between San Luis Obispo and Union Station in Los Angeles and Thruway Motorcoach buses transported "Coast Starlight" passengers from Union Station to Santa Barbara to board the trains. Metrolink service on the Ventura County Line was interrupted north of Chatsworth, and all service resumed four days after the accident.
Investigation.
Preliminary investigation controversy.
Metrolink spokeswoman Denise Tyrrell disclosed the day after the crash that a preliminary investigation of dispatch records and computers showed the engineer of the Metrolink passenger train failed to stop his train for a red railway signal, which indicated his train did not have authority to proceed on the main track . She was quoted as saying, "We don't know how the error happened, but this is what we believe happened. We believe it was our engineer who failed to stop at the signal." Tyrrell said that if the engineer obeyed the signal, the accident would not have occurred. However Los Angeles County Supervisor and Metrolink board member Don Knabe said it was premature to blame the engineer, speculating that "there could always be a technical malfunction where ... there was a green light both ways."
After a Metrolink board meeting two days after her remarks, Tyrrell resigned. Tyrrell stated that she quit because a Metrolink Board statement called her announcement premature, and inappropriate; she maintained that it was proper to get out in front of the story before the NTSB took over the investigation. She stated that she asked for and received authorization to make the comments from David Solow, Metrolink's chief executive. Solow confirmed that he did give authorization, but said in hindsight he would not have given permission. After her resignation, some good government proponents praised Tyrrell for her candor, including the chief public advocate with California Common Cause. The "Los Angeles Times" also published an editorial by columnist Patt Morrison sympathetic to Tyrrell's position, in which she says, "I am unclear of the concept of how the truth can somehow be premature. The truth is the truth."
Official investigation.
The NTSB led the official investigation to determine the probable cause, but NTSB officials had not commented on the accident prior to the Metrolink statement. In a subsequent press conference at the scene two hours after Tyrrell's comments, an NTSB official cautioned that the cause of the accident was still under investigation. The NTSB studied the data from the train event recorders, which had been recovered by NTSB investigators working at the scene. The Metrolink train had two data recorders, one badly damaged, and the freight train had a data and a video recorder. The NTSB said it would collect other evidence and interview witnesses to try to officially report within a year's time why the crash occurred.
Tests of the railway signal system after the accident showed it was working properly, and should have shown proper signal indications to the Metrolink train, with two yellow signals as the train approached the Chatsworth station, and a red signal at the switch north of the station. "We can say with confidence that the signal system was working," the lead NTSB board member stated at a news conference after the tests. This focused the NTSB investigation on human factors.
Before releasing the accident scene and allowing restoration of service, the NTSB also conducted a final sight distance test. An identical Metrolink train and pair of Union Pacific locomotives were brought together at the point of impact and slowly backed away from each other. The test showed that the trains' engineers could not see each other until less than five seconds before the collision.
The surviving crew members could not be interviewed by the NTSB immediately after the accident because they were still recovering from their injuries. The NTSB was able to interview the Metrolink conductor about recorded radio communications, which did not capture the required communication between the conductor and engineer on the aspects displayed by the last two signals the train passed before the accident. He confirmed they did not call out the last two signals.
The NTSB also stated that a railroad switch showed evidence of damage consistent with the Metrolink passenger train "running through" the trailing switch points while they were set to allow the freight train to proceed onto the adjacent track, forcing them out of the way. "The switch bars were bent like a banana. It should be perfectly straight," according to the NTSB official. The NTSB member in charge of the investigative team said they were also concerned with possible fatigue issues related to the engineer's split shift. The engineer worked an 11.5-hour shift split with a 3.5-hour break, leaving only nine hours away from work between workdays.
The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is also investigating to determine if any federal safety regulations were violated. The California Public Utilities Commission, the state agency responsible for regulating railroads, also reported that it has ten investigators with railroad experience working in conjunction with the NTSB, and will also be looking into the matter of the Tyrrell resignation.
Possible false green.
Before the conclusion of the formal investigation, three witnesses came forward to say that they observed the signal to be green as the Metrolink train departed the Chatsworth station just before the collision. A newspaper reporter interviewed the witnesses at the station, and confirmed that the signal was visible from the station, and that the witnesses could correctly identify the colors displayed. A safety consultant said that although this type of signal failure is extremely rare, he had seen it twice before in his 13-year career as a locomotive engineer. The NTSB considered the eyewitness' accounts and, based on the results of its tests of the signal system and on the distance between the witnesses and the signal, rejected them as "contrary to the other evidence".
Text messaging.
Local television news broke the story that the Metrolink engineer was exchanging brief text messages with a teenage train enthusiast while operating the train, a violation of Metrolink rules according to the agency. The last message received from the engineer, time-stamped one minute before the collision, reportedly said, "yea ... usually @ north camarillo," apparently a reference to a town further down the line where the engineer expected to meet another train.
The NTSB did not recover the engineer's cellphone in the wreckage and said the teenagers were cooperating with the investigation, initially noting that similar rumors about an engineer using a cell phone from an investigation recently conducted in Boston were unfounded. After receiving the engineer's cell phone records under subpoena, the NTSB confirmed that the engineer was texting while on duty, but had not yet correlated the messages with the accident timeline. After completing a preliminary timeline, the NTSB placed the last text message sent by the engineer at 22 seconds before impact.
An NTSB representative refused to comment further on the preliminary timeline, which investigators were still refining. Two University of Southern California academics used the information in the NTSB statement to determine that the last text message sent by the Metrolink train's engineer would have been sent a few seconds after he had passed the last red signal. This would make unconsciousness an unlikely cause for this error, since the engineer was able to compose and send the message; instead a psychology professor from the University of Utah raised the possibility that "inattention blindness" caused the engineer to fail to see the signal.
The day after the NTSB confirmed the engineer was texting, and less than one week after the accident, the California Public Utilities Commission unanimously passed an emergency order to temporarily ban the use of cellular communication devices by train crew members, citing this accident and a previous San Francisco Municipal Railway accident where the train operator was using a cell phone.
A week later, texting while driving an automobile was outlawed in California, effective January 1, 2009.
There was no federal regulation prohibiting cell phone use by train crews at the time of the accident, but the NTSB had recommended the Federal Railroad Administration address the issue in 2003, after concluding cell phone use by a freight train engineer contributed to a fatal head-on train collision in Texas in 2002. However, 19 days after the accident the FRA administrator issued Emergency Order No. 26 restricting the use of "personal electronic or electrical devices" by railroad operating employees.
On March 3, 2009 federal investigators released records showing that the train engineer Robert M. Sanchez had allowed a train enthusiast to ride in the cab several days before the crash, and that he was planning to let him run the train between four stations on the evening of the crash. "I'm gonna do all the radio talkin' ... ur gonna run the locomotive & I'm gonna tell u how to do it," Sanchez wrote in one text. Records also show Sanchez had received two prior warnings from his supervisors about improper use of cellphones while in the control cab.
Conductor's role.
The operating rules for trains with a single engineer is that all signals are to be reported to the conductor. This allows the conductor to pull the air (apply the emergency brakes) should the engineer appear to be incapacitated for any reason. However, in this incident, according to the data video, the last two signals were not reported, nor did the conductor apply the brakes.
Unusually, the conductor told the engineer that the starting signal was green, rather than the other way around.
NTSB's conclusions and recommendations.
On January 21, 2010, the NTSB issued a press release announcing its conclusions from the investigation into the collision. In the report, the NTSB concluded that the cause of the accident was most likely the result of the Metrolink engineer's use of text messaging while on duty, which led to the train being operated through a red signal into the path of the oncoming Union Pacific freight train. The investigation has led the NTSB to recommend that the federal government require the installation of video and audio recording equipment in all locomotive and train operating cabs.
Positive train control.
Officials, experts, and litigators have injected the example of this accident into the discussions around deployment of positive train control (PTC), a safety backup system that can automatically stop a train. Federal Railroad Administrator Joseph H. Boardman told a reporter days after the accident that PTC "would have stopped the train before there was a collision." The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) member leading the investigation also said she was convinced that such a system "would have prevented this accident." These systems are not widely deployed yet, and would require a multi-billion US dollar investment to reach that goal nationwide. A Metrolink board member acknowledged they were studying this technology, but said that press reports implying that PTC systems were available off the shelf are misleading, and denied that cost was the primary reason it has not been deployed there. PTC has been on the NTSB's most wanted safety improvements list since 2001.
At the next regularly scheduled Metrolink board meeting after the accident, the board decided not to wait for PTC to be ready for deployment before making system safety improvements; instead Metrolink will expand the existing automated train stop system used on of Metrolink track in Orange County across its system. Metrolink's automated train stop system will automatically apply the brakes to stop a train if the engineer fails to respond to a warning within eight seconds. It was originally installed in the 1950s by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to allow trains to operate at speeds of over 79 mph under regulations imposed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, a former federal regulatory body whose safety functions have since been assumed by the Federal Railroad Administration. Metrolink is also adding a second engineer to some trains to improve safety.
Litigation.
On September 15, 2008, the family of a 19-year-old killed in the crash announced they had filed a claim with Metrolink, generally a precursor to a lawsuit, "alleging the agency chose not to use the available rail safety features," referring to positive train control which they say would have averted the disaster. Eleven days later, an attorney representing the brakeman of the freight train announced a lawsuit against Metrolink, which also named Veolia Transportation and its subsidiary, Connex Railroad, the Metrolink engineer's employer, as defendants. The claim they filed against Metrolink and Veolia was denied, allowing them to proceed with the lawsuit. The lawyer asserted that the Metrolink engineer "was asleep at the switch and not paying attention to what was going on around him ..." and that Metrolink "allowed a dangerous, defective and unsafe condition to exist."
An issue likely to come into play will be a provision in the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-134), which places a US$200 million cap on the aggregate of all passengers' damage claims in a railroad accident against a passenger railroad, including punitive damages. Bloomberg News reported that this event would likely be the first legal test of this law, according to a former House rail committee staffer who helped write the law, who predicted that given the number of casualties, the cap is almost certainly going to be an issue in pending litigation. An attorney representing two of the victims agreed, saying payouts could range from $5 million to $10 million per death or serious injury. Metrolink reportedly has insurance coverage totaling $150 million.
The California Government Claims Act prescribes a six-month deadline for initiating claims for personal injury or wrongful death against government agencies after an accident, so time was of the essence for plaintiffs as well as their legal advocates. However, the aggressive tactics of some lawyers led the State Bar of California to publicly warn its members that unsolicited contact with a potential client is both illegal and unethical.
Other railroads.
In response to this event, other commuter railroads made statements to reassure their passengers of the safety of their operations, and these responses provided some perspective on how other operators mitigate related risks. A spokesman for the nation's largest commuter rail operation, the Long Island Rail Road in New York, said that it had studied positive train control, but decided to stick with its "automatic speed control system," a form of cab signaling with automatic train stop using technology that is more than 50 years old. The San Diego's Coaster commuter line also has an automatic train stop system that a spokesman said will stop the train automatically if the engineer fails to stop at a red stop signal.
Boston's MBTA says its "Cab Signal with Positive Stop" system can stop a train that passes a stop signal or when another train is in its path; the system averted disaster in March 2008 when it stopped a train heading for a runaway freight car. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority had Automatic Train Control on 80% of its system, and was planning to install it in the other 20% by 2014.
The Denver area Regional Transportation District said that its FasTracks commuter rail program has been designed to limit exposure to freight traffic by using physical separation with separate freight and passenger tracks where possible and using temporal separation by running passenger trains during the day, and freight at night and between rush hours. The "San Jose Mercury News" reported that San Francisco Bay Area Caltrain commuters are much less likely to be in a head-on collision because opposing trains usually run on separate tracks, and runs freight only at night on a large portion of its route. The North County Transit District's spokesman for its Sprinter service in San Diego also said it runs freight only at night when passenger service is suspended.
Memorials.
Following the collision a temporary, spontaneous memorial of flowers and notes was erected at the Simi Valley Amtrak/Metrolink Station. On September 8, 2009, the first permanent memorial, a plaque, was placed in Union Station. The Metrolink Memorial Plaza was dedicated on September 12, 2009 at the Simi Valley station. The plaza features 11 columns, one each for the ten deceased passengers from Simi Valley and an additional one for the 14 other deceased victims. There are also 25 markers on the grounds to commemorate each victim as well as a seating area and a plaque in remembrance to the 2005 Glendale train crash. Two days later, on the first anniversary of the crash a memorial ceremony was held at Stony Point Park, near the location of the collision.

Dave Brown (baseball)

David Brown (born June 9, 1895) was a left-handed pitcher in Negro league baseball. Considered one of the better pitchers in negro league history, he was also known for serious off-the-field problems. His career came to a premature end when he became a fugitive after allegedly killing a man in 1925.
Early career.
Brown was born in Leon County, Texas. He had a good curveball and excellent control. He was also a good fielder and had outstanding speed but was a weak hitter. Brown played with the Dallas Black Giants in 1917 and 1918. He was regarded as a "timid nice guy" who did not cause trouble, but during his time with the Dallas Black Giants he was involved in a highway robbery. Although Brown was reported to have become a fugitive, Rube Foster agreed to pay $20,000 for Brown's parole and he became a member of Foster's Chicago American Giants.
Chicago American Giants Seasons.
Brown became the ace of the American Giants as they dominated negro league baseball in the early 1920s. From 1920 through 1922, he posted a 29-8 record in league games. His 11-3 record led them to a pennant win in 1921 including three victories in a playoff with the Bacharach Giants. His 8-3 record contributed to another pennant in 1922. In the winter following the 1922 season, Brown joined Oscar Charleston for the first season of the Cuban League's Santa Clara Leopardos.
League change and abrupt career end.
For the 1923 season, Brown left Rube Foster's American Giants for the brand new Eastern Colored League. Foster voiced his displeasure, pointing out that Brown had been paroled to him and that he had promised Brown's mother to take care of him. He pointed out that the public would vilify him if he revoked. Brown posted a losing record in his first season with the New York Lincoln Giants but he and Charleston returned to Cuba the following winter and helped Santa Clara compile one of the best records in Cuban baseball history. His second season with the Lincoln Giants improved on the first and he defeated "Cannonball" Dick Redding and the Brooklyn Royal Giants to win the New York City championship.
Brown's career came to an abrupt end in 1925. He went to a bar one night with Frank Wickware and Oliver Marcelle. Marcelle was a third baseman with a reputation for trouble off the field. A fight erupted at the bar, possibly involving cocaine, and Brown killed one of the participants. Wickware and Marcelle were questioned the next day at the ballpark, but Brown had disappeared.
Rumors and legacy.
The FBI searched for Brown but he was never officially seen again. Rumors abounded that he continued playing baseball under the alias "Lefty Wilson" with semi-professional teams through the Midwestern United States. Lefty Wilson toured with Gilkerson's Union Giants in 1926, a white team in Bertha, Minnesota in 1927 and 1928, and he was rumored to have played in Sioux City, Iowa in 1929 and Little Falls, Minnesota in 1930. More unsubstantiated rumors claimed that Brown died under mysterious conditions in Denver, Colorado in 1930. However, Lefty Wilson shows up again pitching for the Gilkerson's Union Giants again in 1932.
In 1927, a "Pittsburgh Courier" column solicited opinions for the best black baseball player of all time. On April 2, John Henry Lloyd announced his list which included Dave Brown. When the "Pittsburgh Courier" announced a similar list in 1952, they included Brown on their second team.

Maltbie Davenport Babcock

Maltbie Davenport Babcock (August 3, 1858 – May 18, 1901) was a noted American clergyman and writer of the 19th century. He authored the familiar hymn, "This is My Father's World", among others.
Early years and personal life.
Babcock was born at Syracuse, New York, eldest son of Henry and Emily Maria (Maltbie) Babcock. His first American ancestor was James Babcock (1612–1679), a native of England, who emigrated in 1642, settling first at Portsmouth, Rhode Island and then in Westerly, where his descendents became prominent. Maltbie Davenport Babcock's great-grandfather, Henry Davis, was second president of Hamilton College, and his grandfather, Rev. Ebenezer Davenport Maltbie, was also a Presbyterian minister of note. As a young man, Babcock was described as "tall and broad-shouldered" and a muscular swimmer and baseball player.
Maltbie Babcock was educated in the public schools of Syracuse and graduated in 1879 from Syracuse University with highest honors. He played Baseball on the University's ball team and was a member of the Psi Upslion Fraternity. He was selected to give the Alumni Address in 1895. He studied theology at the Auburn Theological Seminary, receiving his degree there in 1882. He married Katherine Eliot Tallman youngest daughter of John Peck Higgins Tallman a prominent lawyer of Poughkeepsie, New York, on October 4, 1882. They had two children, both of whom died in infancy. Edward Anderson d. August 21, 1883 and John Tallman d. February 11, 1890.
Ministry.
Upon receiving his degree in theology in 1882, Babcock became pastor of a church at Lockport, New York. He was described as having "an unusually brilliant intellect and stirring oratorical powers that commanded admiration, won for him a foremost place among the favorites of his denomination".
From 1887 to 1900, Babcock was senior minister of the prestigious Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church in Baltimore, Maryland. While pastoring Brown Memorial, he was acclaimed for his oratory and use of colorful metaphors in his sermons. He also led a fund-raising effort to assist Jewish refugees from Russia who were victims of an anti-Jewish pogrom in the 1880s. Babcock was honored by a Doctor of Divinity degree from Syracuse University in 1896.
He was called to the Brick Church of New York City in 1900, where his annual compensation was approximately $30,000. So popular was he that many prominent Baltimoreans, including the faculty of Johns Hopkins University, unsuccessfully implored Babcock to remain at Brown instead of accepting the call to Brick Presbyterian Church. A 1910 biography said of him, 
Death and legacy.
Babcock died at age 42 in Naples, Italy, on May 18, 1901, returning from a trip to the Holy Land. According to a New York Times report of May 20, 1901, he committed suicide by slitting his wrist and ingesting "corrosive sublimate" or mercuric chloride. He was being treated in the International Hospital in Naples for what was called "Mediterranean fever," an archaic term for brucellosis. Several of his travel companions suffered from this bacterial infection which causes fever, pain and depression. Babcock had been hospitalized for depression in Danville, New York, ten years before his death.
At his funeral in New York City, the presiding clergyman eulogized him, "We do not need a candle to show a sunbeam...The work our brother has done — the life he lived speaks for him." In Baltimore, a memorial service was held on June 2, 1901, where he was eulogized by various prominent educators, including Daniel C. Gilman, the first president of Johns Hopkins University, John F. Goucher, the founder of Goucher College, and Francis L. Patton, president of Princeton University. Babcock was praised as "always wise, patient, sympathetic and inspiring". He is buried at Oakwood Cemetery in Syracuse, New York.
When Babcock lived in Lockport, he took frequent walks along the Niagara Escarpment to enjoy the overlook's panoramic vista of upstate New York scenery and Lake Ontario, telling his wife he was "going out to see the Father's world". She published a poem by Babcock shortly after his death, entitled "This is My Father's World". Now sung as a well-known hymn, its verses are:
A large stained glass window was installed in 1905 at Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church in Babcock's memory. "The Holy City", by Louis Comfort Tiffany, depicts St. John's vision of the "New Jerusalem" described in . It has brilliant red, orange, and yellow glass etched for the sunrise, with textured glass used to create the effect of moving water. It is said to be one of the two largest windows crafted by Tiffany.

Shop fitting

Shop fitting (shopfitting) is the trade of fitting out retail and service shops and stores with equipment, fixtures and fittings. The trade applies to all kinds of outlets from small corner shops to hypermarkets. A shop fitter executes planning, designs shop layout and installs equipment and services. A shop fitting firm typically incorporates professional expertise in interior design, manufacturing of bespoke furniture, signage and fittings (with own or outsourced facilities) and purchasing of retail equipment.
A shop fitting cycle begins with a survey and measurement of available space and preparing design drawings for submission to the client. Alternatively, the client may have their own drawings prepared by an independent interior designer. The shop fitter arranges for purchase of standard equipment and merchandise or production of bespoke, delivers and physically installs them—until the shop is ready for daily operation.
There are different requirements to the different branches and types of shop. Fashion shop design requires up-to-the-minute awareness of current trends in colour and style to create stores that will draw customers in.

1947–48 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland, France and North America

Between July 1947 and March 1948 the Australia national rugby union team – the Wallabies – conducted a world tour encompassing Ceylon, Britain, France and the United States on which they played five Tests and thirty-six minor tour matches. It was the first such tour in twenty years, since that of the 1927–28 Waratahs, as the 1939 Wallaby tour had been thwarted by World War II.
The 1947–48 side was notable in preserving their try-line uncrossed by any of the Home Nations in the first four Tests played. The nine-month journey was one of the last of that era of epic tours when transport was mostly by ship and when the tourists were whole-heartedly welcomed by rugby fans and townships, civic officials and royalty.
The Australians in those days were still showcasing the new running style of rugby that had not yet been fully embraced in the northern hemisphere. The legacy of Johnnie Wallace's leadership of 1927–28, of Cyril Towers and the credo of galloping rugby as played at his Randwick club in Sydney had some bearing on this. But Batchelor also suggests that the everyday competition for public attention between the two rugby codes caused the Australian game (both in Sydney and Brisbane) to need to match the speed and open play of the 13-a-side code. This need was not the same in London and Cardiff where rugby league as yet posed no threat to spectator numbers coming through rugby union turnstiles.
The squad's leadership.
A squad of thirty players was selected under tour captain Bill McLean. McLean was an experienced Wallaby and leader of men. His father and brother had represented as both Wallabies and Kangaroos, with his other brother Jack also a Wallaby tourist. Bill he had been selected in the 1939 side that had travelled to England under captain Vay Wilson and were promptly turned about upon the declaration of war without playing a match. He had seen action in World War II against the Japanese as a Captain in an AIF Commando unit in Borneo. He had captained Australia's first post-war Wallaby sides on four occasions against the All Blacks. His return to the British Isles was in some ways a completion of unfinished business.
Trevor Allan was only 20 when selected as vice-captain of the squad. He had impressed in his first state and national representative starts a year earlier but in a squad of veteran campaigners including Graeme Cooke and Phil Hardcastle his vice-captaincy was a surprise and an indication that he was being groomed for the future. 
The tour was only six matches old when Bill McLean fulfilled his dream of playing at Twickenham in a minor clash against Combined Services. The match was near completion when McLean was hit by three tacklers from different angles. Howell, Tressider and Shehadie all write that the snap of bone breaking was audible to onlookers. McLean suffered a serious spiral fracture of the tibia and fibula and had played his last representative match. The tour captaincy passed at that moment to Allan, now just a few days past his 21st birthday. Allan was leading a squad comprising war veterans in Ken Kearney, Col Windon, Eddie Broad and Neville Emery; three qualified medical practitioners in Phil Hardcastle, Doug Keller and Clem Windsor; and a mixture of new and experienced Wallabies.
The tradition on earlier Australian tours had been that the manager took care of arrangements and the Asst-Manager fulfilled the coaching duties. Shehadie reports that Arnold Tancred and McLean coached and trained the 1947–48 side with vigour while Jeff Noseda took care of tour administration. Journalist Phil Tressider accompanied the touring party and wrote of Tancred "I remember Tancred as a grim, brooding man who not only managed the team but coached it and was sole selector. He would brook no interference and he kept the press at arm's length. He was fortified by his experiences as a player with the 1927-28 Waratahs and he had an aching ambition for victory", Shehadie wrote of Tancred. " was a very strict disciplinarian who was determined that we would win as many matches as possible. He would constantly remind us that we would only be remembered for the number of matches we won" and goes on to quote Jack Pollard: "The only criticism of Tancred was that relied perhaps too heavily on the team's proven stars and did not give newcomers many opportunities. He barred sportswriters travelling with the team from staying in the same hotel, was uncooperative with the Press, and the team did not enjoy very sympathetic media coverage".
Tour itinerary.
The squad sailed southwards from Sydney Harbour in July 1947 aboard the passenger liner "Orion". They departed Australia from Fremantle after crossing the Great Australian Bight, next docking in Colombo, Ceylon where they were welcomed and entertained by the expatriate community like the 1927–28 Waratahs before them. From there they sailed to Aden in Yemen, then Port Said, Egypt before arriving in England in the port town of Tilbury.
After seeing the sights of a London still scarred from wartime devastation, the party left by train for Penzance in Cornwall where their on-land training would pick up ahead of the first tour match against Combined Cornwall and Devon at Cambourn won by the Wallabies. The minor matches would have an exacting toll with firstly McLean's injury in the sixth game and then the loss of champion Manly winger Charlie Eastes in the match against Newport to a broken arm which also spelled the end of his tour participation.
Rugged matches in Cardiff and Llanelly followed before the Wallabies returned to London where they visited the House of Commons and the House of Lords and met Clement Attlee at 10 Downing St. Later at St James Palace they were received by the Duke of Gloucester, a former Governor-General of Australia and met his young son Prince William. A tour highlight was a royal reception at Buckingham Palace where the squad met the King and Queen and the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. When the squad travelled to Ireland for the second Test they met the President Éamon de Valera.
Back in Britain after the France Test, the Wallabies met the British Barbarians in their inaugural match against an international team – such fixtures would thereafter become a regular event against touring national southern-hemisphere sides. The Barbarians fielded six internationals from England, five from Wales, two from Scotland, one from Ireland. A Barbarian tradition is to select one uncapped player and on this occasion it was Blackheath F.C. winger Martin Turner. The Barbarians won 9–6 and at the after match function tour captain McLean was given honorary Barbarian membership.
After the Barbarians match the team sailed for New York aboard the "Queen Mary". From there they travelled across the Rockies by train, playing a number of fixtures against sides comprising expatriates and American footballers. The final tour match was against a University of California team in Los Angeles. The homeward legs were taken by air – Australian National Airlines flew a Skymaster from Los Angeles to Hawaii (an overnight stop), to Canton Island, to Fiji (another overnight) before arriving in Sydney on 28 March 1948. Two years later that very same plane – the "Amana" – would crash on a scheduled flight from Melbourne to Perth killing all 29 on board.

Australia were beaten squarely in a dull, forwards based game with neither side penetrating to score a try.
The Wallabies enjoyed a feast of possession in the first half with their locks Cooke and Kraefft dominating the line-outs and their forwards ahead in the scrums three to one. The match was played at a furious pace and at the twenty-minute mark suddenly for the first time in four Tests the Australian goal line was threatened when the English centre Bennett put Swarbrick into open space.
"Swarbrick licked up the pass like a sprinter head down for the finish. Sheer pace carried him on. Tonkin could not get to him. He swerved out, his flying feet not brushing the chalk from the touch line. Piper's dash to the corner was too late. Swarbrick pounced forward – he was clear ! The 70,000 crowd were on their toes. Wild arms waved to high heaven. The Twickenham Valley, pinched between the canyon grandstands, reverberated with thundering clanging to a crescendo. He was not only clear – he was through ! He was indeed over the line, safely, marvellously home. He had but to fall on his face and England would be a try up. A dead man must have scored us three points. And then, as Swarbrick hurled himself down, a pin-pointed rocket caught him, swept him through mid-air, ball and all, into the no-man's land of touch in goal. It was Trevor Allan, the forlorn hope, saving his side after all was lost. 
The sides were evenly matched thereafter with both sets of backs depriving the other of a scoring opportunity. Then right before half-time a kick by Newman failed to find touch and landed in the Australian pack for Ken Kearney to bring the ball forward. It went through many hands before Colin Windon scored in the corner to give the Wallabies a 3–0 lead at the break.
With the game three-quarters over England's full-back Syd Newman hit the post with a penalty attempt that would have kept them in the match. Then with ten minutes to go, the game opened up in Australia's favour. Alan Walker chip-kicked ahead, regathered in spectacular fashion and scored. Then Col Windon's punishing defence on English pivot Tommy Kemp saw Kemp spill the ball and Windon set off like "the Breeze" he was affectionately known as and outpace all to the try-line.

DMDM hydantoin

DMDM hydantoin is an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative with the trade name Glydant. DMDM hydantoin is an organic compound belonging to a class of compounds known as hydantoins. It is used in the cosmetics industry and found in products like shampoos, hair conditioners, hair gels and skin care products.
DMDM hydantoin works as a preservative because the released formaldehyde makes the environment less favorable to the microorganisms.
Safety.
A study found "An increase in the use of DMDM hydantoin in cosmetic products will also inevitably increase the risk of cosmetic dermatitis in consumers allergic to formaldehyde." DMDM hydantoin may cause allergic contact dermatitis to the product itself, cross-react with other formaldehyde releasing compounds or due to the formaldehyde released.

<doc id="19328052" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19328052" title="Hatred">
Hatred

Hatred (or hate) is a deep and emotional extreme dislike that can be directed against individuals, entities, objects, or ideas. Hatred is often associated with feelings of anger and a disposition towards hostility. Commonly held moral rules, such as the Golden Rule, oppose universal hatred towards another.
The Bible.
Both the Old and the New Testaments deal with hatred. Ecclesiastes 3:8 teaches that there is a "time to love, and a time to hate;". However, the Old Testament (also known as the Jewish bible, the Tanakh) also contains condemnations of hatred. For example, " thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart". The New Testament emphasizes that evil intentions can be as serious as evil actions. Thus John counted hatred as serious as murder: "whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in himself". All people are though, according to the gospels, sinners, and only have to look inside of themselves in order to find sin. Loving good means hating sin and turning from vice. Love, as Aquinas teaches, must be divided into love of good things, the healthy movement of the soul true to itself, and love of inappropriate objects, the desire to have and use what may be bad for the soul.
It is popularly assumed that one can’t “hate” and “love” the same person at the same time. But Psalm 139 says there is a kind of “perfect hatred” which is consistent with love, and is different from the “cruel hatred” shown by God’s enemies. The Hebrew word describing David’s “perfect hatred” (KJV) means that it “brings a process to completion”. In other words, goal oriented opposition. The ultimate opposition to those who oppose God would be to get them to love God. Or, failing that, to at least stop them from destroying others. The New Testament describes a similar, if not the same, process: “to deliver...unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved...” 
Today’s popular characterization of good hatred is to “hate the sin, but love the sinner”. (David’s “goal oriented opposition” would add that one “loves the sinner” by reforming the sinner, or at least neutralizing his sin.) This is confirmed by the actions of the man who coined “perfect hatred”. It is not recorded that David ever physically punished or fought anybody for merely hating or denying God, but only for acts of aggression. He responded to evil proportionately. He defended himself and his nation from violence, but when people merely turned from God in their hearts, without physical violence, he composed Psalms. Presumably this was the kind of “hatred” in David’s mind when he and his son wrote the only five verses in the Old Testament that suggest God “hates” not just the sin but the sinner. Further evidence that even in these verses what God actually hates is the sin, and that God’s “hatred” is a love-inspired focus on correcting us, is that the people God is said to hate are identified by their sins, of which we are all at least somewhat guilty. No one would have hope if God’s “hatred” meant a sentence to Hell, but the whole Bible is a book of hope for everyone.
The New Testament is unambiguous: it never says God or Jesus hates any person, or that anyone else should. Accordingly, Jesus hated the “doctrines” and “deeds” of the Nicolaitans, but not the Nicolaitans themselves. While Jesus hates sin, He inspires us to love our enemies by pointing out that God equally blesses “the evil and the good”.
Leviticus 19:17 provides one illustration of how popular concepts of love and hate today have departed from biblical concepts. The verse says “thou shalt not hate”, but the rest of the verse explains what that means: “thou shalt...rebuke thy brother, and not sin upon him.” Today’s culture often agrees, calling that “tough love”. While contemporary culture and the bible agree on this notion, they are in conflict over the definition of which behaviors deserve admonishment. At the most extreme points of difference, contemporary culture may consider the rebuking endorsed by the bible to be hatred, especially if the behavior is permissible in secular society. For example, disparaging someone based on their choice of an occupation that the Bible states is sinful could be considered Hate speech, which may be treated as a criminal offence.
Ethnolinguistics.
James W. Underhill, in his "Ethnolinguistics and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate & war", (2012) discusses the origin and the metaphoric representations of hate in various languages. He stresses that love and hate are social, and culturally constructed. For this reason, hate is historically situated. Although it is fair to say that one single emotion exists in English, French (haine), and German (Hass), hate varies in the forms in which it is manifested. A certain relationless hatred is expressed in the French expression "J'ai la haine", which has no equivalent in English. While for English-speakers, loving and hating invariably involve an object, or a person, and therefore, a relationship with something or someone, "J'ai la haine" (literally, I have hate) precludes the idea of an emotion directed at a person. This is a form of frustration, apathy and animosity which churns within the subject but establishes no relationship with the world, other than an aimless desire for destruction. Underhill (following Philippe Roger) also considers French forms of anti-americanism as a specific form of cultural resentment. At the same time, he analyses the hatred promoted by Reagan in his rhetoric directed against the "Evil-Empire". In addition, Underhill suggests it is worrying that foreign languages (French, German, Spanish, Czech) are uncritically assimilating forms of hatred exported by neo-conservative discourse which permeate these languages via the translation of political journalism and the rhetoric of the "War-on-Terror" and the promotion of "Security".
Psychoanalytic views.
In psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud defined hate as an ego state that wishes to destroy the source of its unhappiness. More recently, the "Penguin Dictionary of Psychology" defines hate as a "deep, enduring, intense emotion expressing animosity, anger, and hostility towards a person, group, or object." Because hatred is believed to be long-lasting, many psychologists consider it to be more of an attitude or disposition than a temporary emotional state.
Neurological research.
The neural correlates of hate have been investigated with an fMRI procedure. In this experiment, people had their brains scanned while viewing pictures of people they hated. The results showed increased activity in the middle frontal gyrus, right putamen, bilaterally in the premotor cortex, in the frontal pole, and bilaterally in the medial insular cortex of the human brain.
Legal issues.
In the English language, a hate crime (also known as a "bias-motivated crime") generally refers to criminal acts which are seen to have been motivated by hate. Those who commit hate crimes target victims because of their perceived membership in a certain social group, usually defined by race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, class, ethnicity, nationality, age, gender identity, or political affiliation. Incidents may involve physical assault, destruction of property, bullying, harassment, verbal abuse or insults, or offensive graffiti or letters (hate mail).
Hate speech is speech perceived to disparage a person or group of people based on their social or ethnic group, such as race, sex, age, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, language ability, ideology, social class, occupation, appearance (height, weight, skin color, etc.), mental capacity, and any other distinction that might be considered by some as a liability. The term covers written as well as oral communication and some forms of behaviors in a public setting. It is also sometimes called antilocution and is the first point on Allport's scale which measures prejudice in a society. In many countries, deliberate use of hate speech is a criminal offence prohibited under "incitement to hatred" legislation. It is often alleged that the criminalization of hate speech is sometimes used to discourage legitimate discussion of negative aspects of voluntary behavior (such as political persuasion, religious adherence and philosophical allegiance). There is also some question as to whether or not hate speech falls under the protection of freedom of speech in some countries.
Both of these classifications have sparked debate, with counter-arguments such as, but not limited to, a difficulty in distinguishing motive and intent for crimes, as well as philosophical debate on the validity of valuing targeted hatred as a greater crime than general misanthropy and contempt for humanity being a potentially equal crime in and of itself.

The Ratapani Tiger Reserve, located in the Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh in central India, is one of the finest teak forests in the state and is a short drive away from the capital Bhopal. It is a Wildlife Sanctuary since 1976. As of March 2013, in principle approval by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has been granted for upgrading it to a status of Tiger Reserve. It will become a Tiger Reserve by the notification of the State Government of Madhya Pradesh. Its close proximity to the capital and its relatively untouched forests makes it a promising attraction for tourists and the Madhya Pradesh tourism board plans to make it a wildlife destination in the near future. The reserve is rich in flora and fauna and a wide variety of birds, mammals and reptiles call it their home. Some of them are Tigers, leopards, wild dogs, sloth bears, striped hyenas, jackals, Indian fox, chital, sambar, nilgai, chinkara, chowsingha, hanuman langur, rhesus macaque and Indian rock python. Decades ago barasingha also used to thrive in Ratapani until they were hunted to extinction by Bhopali "shikaaris" (hunters). Bhimbetka rock shelters, are located within this tiger reserve.

Fuat Uzkınay

Fuat Uzkınay   (b. 1888 - İstanbul, d. 29 March 1956 - İstanbul) was the first Turkish filmmaker.
After finishing İstanbul Highschool, he took physics and chemistry classes at İstanbul University. While he started to work at a high school as a principal, there was a growing interest in cinema among the Ottomans. Uzkınay started to give lessons at his school in order to make his students familiar with cinema. Despite the fact that numerous cinemas existed in İstanbul, Uzkınay campaigned for the building of a Turkish-owned cinema, which opened on 19 March 1914. The name, "The National Cinema", would change later to "Ali Efendi sineması". Meanwhile he learned to use the projector from Sigmund Weinberg, who was the first man to introduce the cinema to the Ottomans.
While in the army, on 14 November 1914 he filmed the destruction of the Russian Monument at Ayestefanos. This 150mt. film is known as the first documentary film of the Turkish Cinema. One year later, he founded, on the order of General Enver Paşa, the "Central Army Cinema Department". Sigmund Weinberg was the Chairman of the department and Uzkınay was his assistant. One year later, Uzkınay succeeded Weinberg in that position.
He received education in Germany on film production. He completed his first movie "Himmet Aga'nin İzdivaci" in 1918, despite many difficulties he encountered. In 1954, he retired from the Turkish army and died in 1956.

The band completed formation in early 2007 and describe their sound a fusion of Scandinavian melodic death metal, new wave American metal, old school thrash metal and progressive metal. "UNIVERSUM" have released two albums to date, the debut album Leto Destinatus on 15 June 2008 and their second album Mortuus Machina on 1 January 2011.
Band history.
Formed in early 2006, their sound was influenced by such bands as Pantera, Death, and Iron Maiden. In 2007, Universum completed an eponymous demo. Soon Liam Brophy and Rachael Madden were added to the line up. Playing a string of Australian shows, Universum entered the Emergenza Battle of the Bands competition where they came away runners up in the South Australian state final, winning 'Best Vocalist' and 'Best Guitarist.' Shortly following, the band recorded their debut album, Leto Destinatus, which was well received by critics. The album was mixed and mastered in Sweden by the renowned Jens Bogren (Opeth, Soilwork, Amon Amarth). The artwork was done by Gus Sazes, and the album featured a guest solo by Tomy Laisto from the Finnish melodeath band Mors Principium Est. Following the album's release, the band were signed by Riot Entertainment. In October 2008, Universum embarked on their first Australian national tour, with the UK's power metal band Dragonforce. They have also secured 2009 shows with Cradle Of Filth, Edguy, Cynic, Dark Funeral and Ensiferum. The band has featured on both the UK's Terrorizer magazine (Jan 2009, issue No. 180) and Metal Hammer's (Apr 2009, issue No. 191) covermount CDs.
On the back of releasing Leto Destinatus, Universum picked up a string of endorsements and in March 2010 Michael Soininen and Stephen Murphy were fortunate enough to be the first Australian guitarists listed on the Ibanez guitars web page artist roster.
Universum have announced they are to commence recording of the follow-up to their debut album Leto Destinatus in the coming months. Due for release on 1 January 2011, the album tentatively titled ‘Mortuus Machina’ will feature guest appearances from vocalist Christian Älvestam (ex Scar Symmetry, Miseration), vocalist Tommy Tuovinen (myGRAIN), as well as guest guitar solos from Nightrage axe men Marios Iliopoulos and Olof Mörck. Jens Bogren of Sweden’s Fascination Street Studios (Opeth, Soilwork, Amon Amarth, Katatonia) will once again be handling both mixing and mastering duties.
In June 2010, the band confirmed on their Myspace page that they had parted ways with their longtime bassist Liam Brophy.
Universum released their second album 'Mortuus Machina' on 1 January 2011.

The Maytones

The Maytones (sometimes known as The Mighty Maytones) are a Jamaican reggae vocal duo who were active between the late 1960s and until 1980.
History.
The Maytones formed in the late 1960s, and comprised Vernon Buckley and Gladstone Grant, both of whom lived in May Pen in Clarendon, which inspired the group's name. After recording two rocksteady tracks for Studio One which were not released, they recorded much of their early material for Alvin Ranglin, having local hits with "Loving Reggae" and "Funny Man", and released a version of Greyhound's "Black and White" (written by Earl Robinson and David I. Arkin) in 1970. They had further Jamaican hits with love songs such as "Preaching Love", "If Loving You Was Wrong", and "Brown Girl", before adopting a roots reggae style for tracks such as "Judas", "Babylon a Fall", and "Run Babylon". They had a major success with "Madness", recorded again for Ranglin, which was followed by an album of the same name. The success of The Mighty Diamonds prompted the group and producers Ranglin and Clement Bushay to promote the duo as The Mighty Maytones. The "Boat To Zion" album followed in 1978, although did not meet with the success they had hoped for, and were overlooked by the British record labels that were signing up much of Jamaica's talent at the time, with their non-Rasta image identified as a factor. They contributed the track "Money Worries" to the Rockers soundtrack in 1979.
The duo came to an end in 1980 when Buckley moved to Canada. They reunited in the 2000s. Vernon issued a solo album, "Raw", and has performed and recorded with Bedouin Soundclash.

Be Here Now Tour

The Be Here Now World Tour was a world concert tour by English rock band Oasis in support of their third album "Be Here Now". The tour, which spanned the UK, Europe, the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, Asia, and Latin America, included 85 shows over a period of several months in 1997 and 1998. The tour started on 14 June 1997 in support of U2 at the KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, United States, and ended on 25 March 1998 at the Sports Palace in Mexico City, Mexico. With most shows being played during the autumn and winter months, a majority of the concerts were staged at indoor arenas and halls, in contrast to the larger outdoor venues typically featured on Oasis' summer tours.
Many performances were audio recorded by either broadcast media or concert attendees and have since been made available on various file-sharing outlets and fan web sites. A handful of performances were also carried by various television outlets throughout the world, including the 14 December concert at the G-Mex in Manchester, England.
Fueled partly by worldwide stardom and drug use, the tour and corresponding album became "infamous" for the amount of excess and spectacle they provided. Accordingly, they marked the end of the cocaine era for Noel Gallagher. He would later say about the craziness and wild year on tour: "I kid you not, there was a sound guy who quit because there was too much 'food'...and I thought 'sure it's not the fucking coke you've been taking'".
As the tour came to an end, the album's reception had changed from rave and outstandingly positive to less-than satisfied and below average reviews with many critics restating that it was weak in comparison to the group's first two records. By mid-1998, their popularity had noticeably fallen in the United States as well as the UK, possibly due to their fading image as bad boy rock stars. They did, however, manage to maintain a large cult following in many countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Russia, Italy, Spain, South Korea and Japan where their public persona has strengthened even more over the last decade.
Stage setup.
Oasis had a unique album-themed stage set up for the tour, featuring props and set pieces for the first time in their career. At various points on the tour, stage items included a Rolls Royce rigged with stage lights, an oversized telephone box, and other items from the "Be Here Now" album cover.
At the start of many performances, a man outfitted with a tailor suit and top hat would appear onstage to excite the crowd, beckoning them to scream and clap, while the opening piano loop for the song "Be Here Now" began playing over the concert PA. The band then entered onto the stage through a large door in the prop telephone box, which doubled as an entryway to backstage. As the tour progressed, different shows featured varying types and numbers of set pieces, though the "Be Here Now" introduction remained a constant through the duration of performances.
Set list.
The band's typical set list was:
The band would occasionally feature "Whatever" and "My Big Mouth". They would also sometimes break while Noel performed a selection of songs acoustically, like "Help!" in Nippon Budokan; "Talk Tonight"; and a song that he collaborated on with The Chemical Brothers called "Setting Sun". This would normally lead straight into an acoustic version of "Fade In-Out". The band also performed "Magic Pie", this coming to an end before the G-Mex shows. The band once performed "The Girl in the Dirty Shirt" with Noel on vocals in Dublin.
For the U2 support slots, Oasis played between 7 and 12 songs, generally from the same setlist as the main tour, but Noel acoustically performed "Cast No Shadow".

Ibn al-Arif

Ibn al-Arif (nickname) or Abul Abbas Ahmad Ibn Mohammed Ibn Musa Ibn Ata Allah al-Mariyyi al-Sanhaji, also known as Al-Urruf (born July 23 1088 in Almeria and died 1141 in Ceuta) was a famous Andalusian Sufi. He is especially well known as the founder of a Sufi school or tariqa, which was based on the teachings of Ibn Masarrah, and as the author of "Mahasin al-Majalis" ("The Attractions of Mystical Sessions").
Ibn al-Arif was born, and spent most of his life, in Almeria in Al-Andalus at the height of the Almoravid power. His father came from Tangier and his family belonged to the Berber tribe of the Sanhaja. Almeria was a center of Sufism at that time. He and Ibn Barrajan, another Andalusian Sufi based in Seville, gathered around themselves a large number of followers, which attracted the attention of the Almoravid authorities. In 1141 both men were called to Marrakech by the sultan Ali ibn Yusuf, where they were accused of "professing heterodox doctrines." Ibn al-Arif defended himself and was released, but died shortly after. According to Ibn al-Abbar, either "the sultan was convinced of Ibn al-Arif's excellence and piety and ordered him to be released and escorted to Ceuta" where he died of an illness, or "Ibn al-Arif was poisoned on his return journey, while making the sea crossing." His tomb is in Marrakech.

Landscape with the Ashes of Phocion

Landscape with the Ashes of Phocion is a 1648 painting, also known as Landscape with the Ashes of Phocion (Collected by His Widow) and The Ashes of Phocion Collected by his Widow, by French artist Nicolas Poussin. Phocion was an Athenian statesman from the 4th century BC. 
" It is a picture about exile. Phocion, an Athenian general, was falsely condemned and executed, and his unburied corpse banished, and taken to the outskirts of Megara where it was burnt. At the very front his faithful widow gathers up his ashes. Her servant keeps look out. And the outcasts are placed directly below the mighty nucleus of temple-rock-cloud. But nothing in the scene indicates that the civilisation from which they're excluded is itself evil, corrupt or doomed, that they're well out of it. No, their exile from the good life is sheer tragedy. The majestic symphony of the city continues undiminished." 
The painting is housed at the Walker Art Gallery, part of the National Museums Liverpool, England.
The same year Poussin painted a companion piece to "Landscape with the Ashes of Phocion", "The Funeral of Phocion", in three versions.

Abdulla Telman Alishayev (died 2 September 2008) was a Russian Dagestani journalist and writer. Alishayev was the television host of a popular mainstream Islamic television station in the Republic of Dagestan, a multi-ethnic Russian republic within the Caucasus region.
Career.
Alishayev hosted a popular Islamic themed television program called "Peace to Your Home", which aired on TV Chirkey (Tv-Chirkei), a mainstream Muslim television station. He was a prominent opponent of fundamentalist Islam within Dagestan and Russia. He had recently hosted and aired a documentary on TV Chirkey criticizing radical forms of Islam. Alishayev was particularly critical of Wahhabism, which had taken root in neighboring Chechnya, and actively advocated for more moderate forms of Islam.
Death.
Alishayev was shot in the head and shoulder by two unknown assailants while driving his car on the evening of 2 September 2008. The attack took place in the Dagestani capital city, Makhachkala. He was rushed to Makhachkala’s Central Hospital, where he was operated on. However, Alishayev died on 3 September 2008. His funeral was attended by over 1,000 people.
Alishayev's killing came less than three days after the police shooting of journalist and businessman Magomed Yevloyev, the owner of Ingushetiya.ru, in the nearby Republic of Ingushetia.
Reaction.
U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said of the killing of Alishayev that "There needs to be people held to account for what happened. There is in Russia itself, unfortunately, a sad recent history of violence against journalists who are merely seeking to do their job. And the kinds of threats, intimidation, and violence that's used against a free press or those seeking to work in a free press in Russia have been unacceptable."

Unknown Territory

Unknown Territory is the second studio album from U.K. dance act Bomb the Bass. It was released in 1991 under label Rhythm King Records.
Production.
In 1991 "Love So True" with vocals from Loretta Heywood was the first single of new Bomb the Bass material. It suffered under hastily imposed (and unofficial) censorship broadcast regulations, as the outbreak of the First Gulf War prompted UK broadcasters, especially the main national music station BBC Radio 1, to blacklist a variety of songs and acts deemed potentially controversial due to their content or titles. The band name Bomb the Bass was considered to fall into this category, along with that of Massive Attack. Copies of the "Love So True" single were re-issued credited to Tim Simenon instead, but the resulting confusion may have impeded the single's chart chances.
With the Bomb the Bass moniker restored, and an album ready to go, band activity once again ground to a halt, when the collection, now titled "Unknown Territory", was delayed when Pink Floyd refused to allow a section of "Money" to be sampled on one of the album's tracks.
With the contentious Pink Floyd sample removed, the album campaign revved up once again. Second single "Winter in July" fared much better, subsequently becoming a summer-fuelled UK Top 10 hit. The track, co-written with Guy Sigsworth and vocalist Loretta Heywood featured several prominent samples from the Japan track "Ghosts" (as featured on the band's final studio album, "Tin Drum"). This act of inclusion-by-sampling saw Simenon following the hip hop ethos of paying homage to heroes on record. By referencing the David Sylvian-led band's influential textual and ambient work many years before, Simenon was giving notice of his intention to help push hip hop-oriented dance music in the direction that would become trip-hop.
Once again pioneering new sounds in the public arena, and following the success of "Winter in July", "Unknown Territory" would be the band's most well received release to date. Reviewing the album at the time, music writer and author Simon Reynolds attempted to outline a new genre in the making, suggesting that, by moving beyond mere dance tracks into fully cohesive albums, the band were venturing into "progressive dance". However, the term did not stick.
As usual on the album, a great deal of Simenon's hip hop fascination would shine through (most notably, the production work of The Bomb Squad with Public Enemy) via the use of multi-media samples, with the album containing dialogue or soundtrack clips from "Rollerball", "Blade Runner", David Cronenberg's "Videodrome", "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly", "Marvel" comics' "Fantastic Four" animated cartoon series; and "Death Race 2000".
Having developed dance music's potential via debut single "Beat Dis" in to a more song-based form of what the avant-garde would term musique concrète, with its complex use of hybrid hip-hop-inspired sound poaching (in place of actual played sounds) taken to logical extremes, Simenon pre-empted a style that would do well by several major acts in the years to come.
So, whilst the downbeat experimental "Winter in July" and "Love So True" would pave the way for trip-hop, the uptempo breakbeat-heavy side of "Unknown Territory", would be taken into more punk-laced territory as the riotous sound of The Prodigy, from their "Music for the Jilted Generation" album onwards. Further to which, the style would also be explored further by - and prove infinitely more successful, commercially speaking, for - the likes of Fat Boy Slim as the genre known as bigbeat.
Interviewed for "Sound on Sound" magazine in 1995, Simenon agreed with the interviewer when it was suggested that, with this more frenetic side of his work, he was looking to "combine the art of sampling with the energy of rock and roll."

Medical uses.
Its primary use in medicine is in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic kidney disease. In three placebo-controlled studies, chronic renal failure patients treated with paricalcitol achieved a mean parathyroid hormone (PTH) reduction of 30% in six weeks. Additionally there was no difference in incidence of hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia when compared to placebo. A double-blind randomised study with 263 dialysis patients showed a significant advantage over calcitriol (also known as activated vitamin D3; a similar molecule to 1,25-dihydroxyergocalciferol, adding a methyl group on C24 and lacking a double-bond in the C22 position). After 18 weeks, all patients in the paricalcitol group had reached the target parathormone level of 100 to 300 pg/ml, versus none in the calcitriol group. Combination therapy with paricalcitol and trandolapril has been found to reduce fibrosis in obstructive uropathy. Forty-eight week therapy with paricalcitol did not alter left ventricular mass index or improve certain measures of diastolic dysfunction in 227 patients with chronic kidney disease.
Adverse effects.
Adverse effects by frequency:<br>
Very common (>10% frequency):
Common (1-10% frequency):
Uncommon (0.1-1% frequency):
‡ These are adverse effects only seen in patients with grade 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease. 
† These are adverse effects only seen in patients with grade 5 chronic kidney disease.
Contraindications.
Contraindications include:
whereas cautions include:
Interactions.
Drugs that may interact with paricalcitol include: 
Overdose.
Electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia) are common overdose symptoms. Treatment is mostly supportive, with particular attention being paid to correcting electrolyte anomalies and reducing intake of calcium in both the form of supplementation and diet. As it is so heavily bound to plasma proteins haemodialysis is unlikely to be helpful in cases of overdose. 
Early symptoms of overdose can include:
It is worth noting, however, that may of these symptoms are also indicative of kidney failure and hence may be masked by the patient's condition.
Late symptoms of overdose include:
Mechanism of action.
Like 1,25-dihydroxyergocalciferol, paricalcitol acts as an agonist for the vitamin D receptor and thus lowers the bloodparathyroid hormone level.
Pharmacokinetics.
Within two hours after administering paricalcitol intravenous doses ranging from 0.04 to 0.24 µg/kg, concentrations of paricalcitol decreased rapidly; thereafter, concentrations of paricalcitol declined log-linearly. No accumulation of paricalcitol was observed with multiple dosing.

Novelty seeking

In psychology, novelty seeking (NS) is a personality trait associated with exploratory activity in response to novel stimulation, impulsive decision making, extravagance in approach to reward cues, and quick loss of temper and avoidance of frustration. 
It is measured in the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire as well as the later version Temperament and Character Inventory and is considered one of the "temperament" dimensions of personality. Like the other temperament dimensions, it has been found to be highly heritable.
High NS has been suggested to be related to high dopaminergic activity.
In the revised version of the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-R) novelty seeking consists of the following four subscales:
Relationship to other personality traits.
A research study found that Novelty seeking had inverse relationships with other Temperament and Character Inventory dimensions, particularly harm avoidance and to a more moderate extent self-directedness and self-transcendence. Novelty seeking is positively associated with the five factor model trait of extraversion and to a lesser extent openness to experience and is inversely associated with conscientiousness. Novelty seeking is positively related to Impulsive sensation seeking from Zuckerman's Alternative five model of personality and with psychoticism in Eysenck's model.

Thomas Staines

Sir Thomas Staines, (1776 – 13 July 1830), Captain in the Royal Navy, Knight Commander of the Bath, and of the Sicilian Order of St. Ferdinand and Merit, and Knight of the Ottoman Order of the Crescent.
French Revolutionary Wars.
Staines joined on 3 July 1796 on his promotion to Lieutenant. Commander Philip Wodehouse had taken command of "Peterel" by December 1796, when "Peterel" landed a small party under Lieutenant Thomas Staines on the coast of Corsica. The landing party attacked a Martello tower, which they captured, and threw its gun, a long 32-pounder, over the cliff. 
"Peterel"s next captain was Commander William Proby, Lord Proby, who took over in March 1797. In June 1797, Wodehouse authorised Staines to take 20 men in two of the ship's boats to cut out a French privateer that had been preying on merchant vessels off the coast of Tuscany. After a skirmish in which the British had five men wounded and the French lost several dead and wounded, the British took the privateer, which had a crew of 45 men and was armed with two long guns and several swivels.
In September 1798, Commander Henry Digby sailed "Peterel" from Gibraltar to Faro, Portugal, to deliver despatches from Earl St. Vincent for the Lisbon packet. Staines took the six men in "Peterel"s jolly boat to deliver the despatches to the packet when the jolly boat overturned in heavy seas. Four men drowned, and Staines and the sixth man were only rescued after four hours.
"Peterel" participated in the Capture of Minorca (1798) by the British expedition under Commodore John Duckworth. On 12 November 1798 the Spanish 40-gun frigate "Flora", in company with the 40-gun "Proserpina" and the 34-gun ships "Pomona" and "Casilda", captured "Peterel" whilst she was operating off Minorca. One of the Spanish ships fired a broadside after she surrendered. After removing the prisoners from the ship, the Spanish plundered their clothes and possessions, murdering a seaman who attempted to defend his property. Duckworth detached to pursue the sloop and on 13 November she retook "Peterel" and her 72-man Spanish prize crew, which was under the command of Don Antonio Franco Gandrada, Second Captain of "Flora". Captain James Bowen of "Argo" put his own prize crew of 46 officers seamen and marines aboard "Peterel". Duckworth later appointed his first lieutenant, George Jones, to command "Peterel". Most of the clothes belonging to Captain Long and his officers, including Staines, were subsequently recovered. This charge of ill-usage was officially contradicted in the Madrid Gazette of 12 April, but was, nevertheless, essentially true. 
The Spanish squadron, already being chased the next day by several British ships, completely outsailed their pursuers and returned to Cartagena with the prisoners. After a detention of 14 days at Cartagena, Lieutenant Staines and his fellow prisoners were embarked in a merchant brig bound to Malaga; but they did not arrive there until 24 December, a westerly wind having obliged the vessel to anchor off Almeria, where she was detained upwards of three weeks, and her passengers confined on shore during that period. From Malaga, the British were marched to Gibraltar, under a strong escort of soldiers, who treated both officers and men with great brutality, but particularly Lieutenant Staines, who had received a sabre wound in the wrist whilst parrying a blow which one of those soldiers had aimed at his head. On their arrival at the rock, a court-martial was assembled to investigate the circumstances attending their capture by the Spanish squadron; and as no blame could be attached to any individual, the whole of them were sent back to the "Peterel" immediately after their acquittal.
Captain George Long fell at Elba and on 3 February 1799 Francis Austen, the brother of author Jane Austen and future admiral of the fleet, took command of "Peterel". "Peterel" and Austen shared in the proceeds of the capture on 18 June 1799 of the French frigates "Courageuse", "Alceste", and "Junon", and the brigs "Alerte" and "Salamine". Thereafter, "Peterel" captured or cut out from ports an armed galley, a transport brig carrying cannons and ammunition, and some twenty merchant vessels. Staines frequently commanded the cutting out expeditions.
Napoleonic Wars.
In May 1802 Staines assumed command of in the Mediterranean. He sailed her back to Britain where she was paid off in September 1805.
From March 1807 through November 1809, Staines was captain of HMS "Cyane". It was his service on "Cyane", particularly at Naples between 25 and 27 June 1809, which cost him his arm, that led to his knighthood and the Order of Saint Ferdinand. 
On 17 September 1814 HMS "Briton" under his command, along with HMS "Tagus", were the first British ships to visit the Pitcairn Islands after the "Bounty" and discover the fate of the mutineers – this was six and half years after the American ship "Topaz" rediscovered Pitcairn. However, Staines was unaware of that discovery.

Jim Airey

James Sydney "Jim" Airey (born 19 August 1941 in Earlwood, New South Wales) is a former Australian international motorcycle speedway rider who rode in the 1971 World Final in Göteborg, Sweden and was a member of the Great Britain team that won the 1971 Speedway World Team Cup in Wrocław, Poland. Jim is also a four time Australian Champion having won the title in 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1972.
Career summary.
Australia.
Jim Airey started racing Speedway in the early-1960s, quickly establishing himself as a star rider and won his first NSW Solo Championship at the Sydney Showground in 1966, before going on to win the Australian Championship in 1968, also held at the Showground which was his home track.
Airey became known as the "King of the Royale" as he was near unbeatable on the Sydney Showground track (the Showground was known as the "Royale"). At one stage during the late 1960s Airey won a record 33 consecutive scratch races at the Showground. He wasn't totally invincible at the Showground though and regularly faced stiff competition from the likes of good friend Gordon Guasco (who lost his live at Sydney's other speedway, Liverpool in 1970), and visiting English brothers Nigel and Eric Boocock.
He followed up his 1968 Australian Championship by winning both the 1969 and 1970 championships, again all held at the Sydney Showground. He won his fourth and last title in 1972 at Rowley Park in Adelaide. During this time he also won the NSW championship in 1969, 1970, 1971 before winning his last championship in 1974. Three of his five NSW titles won at the Showground, while his 1970 and 1971 wins were at Liverpool in the days when the bikes still used the main track. He would never place second or third in the Australian Championship, only ever stepping onto the podium as the winner.
Airey would also win the Queensland Championship in 1970, winning at both the Brisbane Exhibition Ground (Ekka) and the 3-lap title in Ipswich. He also won the Victorian title in 1971. Airey's NSW state title wins at Liverpool, his Qld and Victorian titles, and his national title win at Rowley Park proved that he wasn't just a one track rider.
Jim Airey was one of the few speedway riders who didn't have a major crash in his career. His secret was known to be that he never rode faster than he needed to, giving himself margin for error. He chose to retire after winning his last NSW Championship in 1974 aged just thirty-three.
England.
Airey rode successfully in the National League for the Sunderland Saints for eight meetings in 1964 before moving to the Wolverhampton Wolves for the remainder of 1964 and 1965. After not competing in England during the 1966 season, Airey returned to Wolverhampton for 1967 and 1968. He then signed with the Sheffield Tigers for 1969 and remained with the team until 1971 before retiring from the British Leagues and returning full time to Australia.
International.
Jim Airey rode in numerous Test Matches for Australia during his career, often captaining the team in matches held in Australia against visiting national teams yet his greatest international success came as a member of the Great Britain speedway team at Wrocław in Poland. Great Britain, containing Jim Airey from Australia, Ivan Mauger, Barry Briggs and Ronnie Moore from New Zealand and Ray Wilson, who was the only rider from Great Britain, easily won the 1971 Speedway World Team Cup scoring 37 points to defeat the Soviet Union on 22 and host nation Poland who finished on 19 points.
Airey also qualified for his only World Championship Final in 1971 held in Göteborg, Sweden. He finished 8th on 8 points after a win, two 2nd places and a 3rd place.

Collective redress

Collective redress is a legal term used within the European Union to define the legal instrument of group proceedings as there is absolutely no regulation at the moment. At the present the European Commission is working on a study to introduce European class action, similar to the US class action.
The project is currently at the stage of obtaining expert report and opinion. A survey carried out by the Commission showed that more than 79% of EU consumers would exercise their rights with other claimants in the event of joint proceedings. The possibility of group action would enable inexpensive legal action and would also act as deterrent. The Commission has declared that it will not be copying the US system, will avoid abusive and excessive practices and will take account of the 27 legal systems of member states that have developed over time. The instrument of class action will not confer any new rights or create new claims but will only provide new ways of asserting these. Some European states already have proceedings which are similar to class action, others have introduced compromises, such as legal action taken by associations, although most EU member states do not have any such instruments.

Ghostgirl

Ghostgirl is the debut novel from author and filmmaker Tonya Hurley. It is the story of high school senior "Charlotte Usher", a misfit outsider whose desperation to be popular lives on even after her sudden death. The young adult novel was published on August 1, 2008 by Little, Brown and Company, and hit the "New York Times" Bestseller list, Chapter Books, on September 14, 2008. "ghostgirl" has been printed in several different languages around the world, including Spanish and French. It was followed by a sequel in July 2009 called "ghostgirl: Homecoming", and a third book, "ghostgirl: Lovesick" was released in July 2010.
The audiobook releases of "ghostgirl" (released August 2009) and "ghostgirl: Homecoming" (released November 2009), from Recorded Books in 2009, are read by actress Parker Posey and feature a score by Vince Clarke of Erasure fame.
Ghostgirl: Homecoming.
Having graduated, Charlotte is told that she and the other ghosts from "Dead Ed" need to work in a phone bank, where they will answer calls from troubled teenagers in need of advice, acting as the teens' consciences. Before starting, the other ghosts receive 'graduation presents': they are reunited with lost loved ones or dead celebrity idols, and receive spacious apartments. However, Charlotte does not meet her dead parents and must live in a cramped dormitory, and at work she is the only ghost not to receive calls. Feeling left out, she begins to ignore her old friends and spends all her time with Maddy, her dormitory roommate and new co-worker, oblivious to the fact that Maddy is sabotaging her attempts to succeed.
Meanwhile, Scarlet is feeling insecure about her long-distance relationship with Damen just as Petula, who is repeating her senior year, goes into a coma after contracting staph from a pedicure. Feeling guilty, and jealous of Damen's sudden arrival to see Petula, Scarlet uses the possession ritual Charlotte taught her to send herself into a coma and seek out Charlotte's help to find Petula's soul. Instead, Scarlet joins the new Dead Ed class, who help her to move on using "Early Decision", a risky shortcut. Meanwhile, Petula finds herself in a waiting room, accompanied by another coma patient, Virginia Johnson, a young beauty pageant contestant who is disdainful of Petula's fashion obsession, and wants to grow old normally. Gradually, the two begin to bond.
Scarlet arrives at Charlotte's dormitory, much to her delight, and they sneak out to find Petula, accompanied by Maddy. However, after a disagreement at a fork in the road, Charlotte and Maddy leave Scarlet on her own. However, Pam and Prue have come after Charlotte, and they meet up with Scarlet and help her to find Petula's soul by getting directions from Green Gary to the hospital intake office. Meanwhile, Damen is desperately trying to revive Scarlet, and he decides to take Petula to Homecoming in the hope of reanimating her, and therefore ending Scarlet's quest. Maddy and Charlotte follow as Maddy tries to convince Charlotte to possess Petula.
Just as Charlotte is about to complete the possession ritual, Scarlet, Pam and Prue arrive to stop her, and explain that Maddy is a murderous soul from hell attempting to turn Charlotte astray so she can "graduate" her own way. Charlotte explains that she had suspected Maddy the whole time, and had intentionally made Pam and Prue suspicious so that they could help her and Charlotte. Charlotte defeats Maddy, and reassures Scarlet that Damen is only helping Petula for Scarlet's sake.
The group find Petula's soul, just as Virginia dies, and Charlotte accompanies her to Dead Ed. Petula awakes at Homecoming, and Damen quickly leaves to find Scarlet at the hospital, where they reconcile. Charlotte returns to her job at the phone bank, and is finally accepted and reunited with her parents.
Ghostgirl:Lovesick.
Charlotte has finally settled into the afterlife and has a dead boyfriend - Eric. As the class are expecting to move on, they receive one more task: to help a 15 year old in Hawthorne through their troubles in time for Prom. Pam and Prue are assigned to the Wendys, Coco to Petula, Charlotte to Damen and Eric to Scarlet.
Scarlet feels out of place as she is leaving her goth fashions behind for a new, more mature look. While this is her choice, she feels Damen pushed her into it, and that he does not accept her for who she is. When Damen arrives in town for a job at the local radio station and enters one of Scarlet's songs, she feels that he is pressuring her and getting to be mad and furious. When she meets Eric, not realising he is dead, she is attracted to him, and feels he allows her to be her true self.
Meanwhile, Petula's coma has left her feeling uncharacteristicly philanthropic, and she has begun to donate her old clothes to the homeless, confusing the Wendys. A new girl called Darcy begins to steal her status, holding a mock trial which ends in Petula being made an outcast. She continues with her charity, hoping that her makeovers will improve the lives of those she helps and wishing for more contact from Virginia. This leads her to ask a homeless boy to attend Prom with her.
When Scarlet's song is disqualified because of Damen's involvement in the entry, the pair began be disagreement and break up. Charlotte also having a disagreement with Eric over his relationship with Scarlet. Irritated, Charlotte attempts to return to the afterlife through the Dead Ed classroom, and discovers Darcy's ghost is in the new Dead Ed class after having a seizure brought on by a camera flash, and that the Darcy in the school is being possessed by someone else. With Pam and Prue, Charlotte plans to evict the evil spirit at Prom. Meanwhile, Darcy asks Damen to Prom, and Scarlet and Eric spend more time together. After they re-record Scarlet's song for the radio competition, Scarlet learns that Eric is dead, and that he never had the chance to play on stage when he was alive.
Scarlet wins the radio competition and chooses as her prize to perform her song at Prom, which she redecorates as a Fantasy Funeral for Charlotte. As Damen and Darcy have their picture taken, Charlotte sabotages the camera to give Darcy another seizure, which evicts Maddy's spirit and reanimates the real Darcy. Because Maddy technically died from the seizure, she must now attend Dead Ed, while Darcy awakens confused and with no memory of the Wendys or anything else about Hawthorne High.
Petula arrives at Prom with her homeless boyfriend, who turns out to be a billionaire in disguise, and the pair are crowned Prom King and Queen. Coco's work completed, Petula receives a new guardian angel - Virginia. Meanwhile, Eric and Scarlet perform onstage together before Damen and Scarlet reunite, and Eric and Charlotte dance together. After the Prom, Charlotte and Scarlet say goodbye in the graveyard, and Charlotte returns to the afterlife, where she introduces Eric to her parents. The Dead Ed class all move on except for Charlotte, who is given Mr Brain's job as the new Dead Ed teacher.
Themes.
The main themes explored in ghostgirl are popularity, obsession, love and death. The author has said that, although the book contains some elements of horror, she would describe it as a romance.
Critical reception.
The book received starred reviews from such literary publications as VOYA (Voice Of Youth Advocates), Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews and School Library Journal. It received generally favourable reviews on Amazon.com, although some sites raised concerns over the use of language. The book also reached tenth on the New York Times Best Seller list.
Character development.
ghostgirl began as a character on the website ghostgirl.com, and then was developed into a novel in March 2008. She is based on the author's experience of working with teenage celebrities and her observations on fame and popularity.
Structure.
The cover art shows the silhouette of a girl – used throughout the book's illustrations to represent Charlotte – in a coffin with a banner saying "Rest in Popularity". The title "ghostgirl" is the name used to refer to Charlotte after her death. The book is unusual in that the pages' proportion of height to width is much larger than usual, making it taller and thinner than most novels.
Inside the book, each chapter begins with a full page illustration, including a quotation and a border of black and pink roses. The illustration usually shows Charlotte's silhouette, as shown on the cover, and forms a chain of actions as the reader progresses through the book. The page afterwards includes a short summary paragraph of a lesson Charlotte learns in the chapter, written in reverse color. The book's pages are edged with a black and pink floral border, which changes from chapter to chapter, and all illustrations within the book are in these two colours.
ghostgirl:Homecoming's is similarly laid out, but with slightly different floral borders, and purple replacing pink in the color scheme. The pages are also edged in purple. Also, the illustrations do not include a quotation and do not form a chain – each is separate. The cover displays Charlotte's face in a mirror, and is highly stylised.
Ghostgirl:LoveSick is similar to both books. The difference is the color of the front is red. Its front cover is a heart shaped locket with Charrlotte blowing a kiss and a heart on her hand. The illustrations include a quotation and before the beginning of each chapter, it speaks of the lesson learned in each chapter.

Folding propeller

A folding propeller is a type of propeller where the propeller blades fold in when the propeller is not in use, and out when the propeller is in use. This type of propeller is often used on sailing yachts to reduce drag while under sail. Folding propellers are also used on model airplanes to reduce air drag when the motor is stopped.
Pros and cons of folding compared with fixed propellers are:

Alfrēds Verners

Alfrēds Verners (1912 - ?) was a Latvian footballer and ice hockey player who played 10 matches for Latvia national football team in the 1920s.
Biography.
Verners began playing both football and ice hockey with Union Riga (as it was a common practice among sportpeople in Latvia before World War II to compete in different sports in summer and winter). Verners got a wider popularity as in 1930 Union returned to the Latvian Higher League and unexpectedly earned a respectable fourth place finish, and won the bronze medals just a year later. In ice hockey Union was an even stronger side, winning the first two Latvian league tournaments, thus by 1933 Verners was a two time champion of Latvia in ice hockey and a one time bronze medallist in football.
On 30 June 1931 Verners made his international début for Latvia national football team scoring a goal and giving passes to two goals to Ēriks Pētersons. In total Verners made 19 appearances for Latvia until 1937 and scored five goals, he also played for the Latvia national ice hockey team. Verners joined Riga Vanderer in 1935 and won the Latvian Cup in 1936 and 1938.

World Wide Web Foundation

The World Wide Web Foundation (also: Web Foundation) is an organization dedicated to the improvement and availability of the World Wide Web. The formation of the organization was announced on September 14, 2008 by Tim Berners-Lee at the Newseum in Washington, D.C.. The organization launched on November 15, 2009. One of its board members is former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
The mission of the organization is "to advance One Web that is free and open", "to expand the Web's capability and robustness" and "to extend the Web's benefits to all people on the planet". The foundation employs three programs, "Web Science and Research", "Web Technology and Practice" and "Web for Society", to reach the objectives of the organization.
The organization is not related to the Open Web Foundation.
Reception.
When announcing the foundation, Berners-Lee discussed a system to label websites for their trustworthiness. According to the BBC he said "there needed to be new systems that would give websites a label for trustworthiness once they had been proved reliable sources." The New Scientist criticized the formation of an organization to tell others what is true or not.

Chinese temple

A Chinese temple is a worship place of the Chinese folk religion/Shenism, where people revere ethnic Chinese gods and ancestors. They can be distinguished into:
These temples are different from:
Both of these can also be monasteries or abbeys.
"Gong" (宫), meaning "palace" is a term often used for large temples, especially Taoist, while "yuan" (院) is a generic term meaning "sanctuary" or "shrine".
Overview.
Chinese indigenous religion's temples are established and administered by local managers, associations and worship communities; they don't have professional clergy, though Taoist clergy can be invited to perform certain rites. Shenist temples are usually small, very colourful (by contrast with Taoist temples which by tradition should be black and white in color, and Buddhist temples which are characterised by a prevalence of yellow and red tonalities), and decorated with traditional figures on their roofs (dragons and deities), although some evolve into significant structures.
Chinese temples can be found throughout Mainland China, Taiwan and also where Chinese expatriate communities settled over centuries. An old name in English, often perceived as derogatory today, for Chinese traditional temples is "joss house". "Joss" is a corrupted version of the Portuguese word for "god", "deus". "Joss house" was in common use in English in western North America during frontier times, when joss houses were a common feature of Chinatowns. The name "joss house" describes the environment of worship. Joss sticks, a kind of incense, are burned inside and outside of the house.

Ron Cooper (Australian footballer)

Ronald Thomas 'Socks' Cooper (8 June 1911 – 18 October 1991) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Carlton and North Melbourne in the VFL. His habit of wearing his socks knee high earned him his nickname.
Cooper, originally from the Albany district, started his career in the West Australian Football League. Playing mostly as a rover or centreman, he spent three seasons with Claremont-Cottesloe and won their 1931 'Best and fairest' award as well as finishing second in the Sandover Medal count to Lin Richards. After 49 games, he sought and received a clearance to Carlton and had a good debut season. 
He broke into the strong Carlton side in round five and was part of nine successive wins as the club made it all the way to the Grand Final. Cooper played in a forward pocket in the Grand Final loss to Richmond and despite appearing in further finals in subsequent years he never made another decider. The closest he came was when Carlton won the premiership in 1938 but he missed the Grand Final through suspension, having been charged with striking St Kilda's Doug Rayment in the final home and away fixture. Despite missing the finals series it was his most prolific season in front of goals, with 30 majors.
'Socks' Cooper crossed to North Melbourne in 1943 but only played the one season. He spent the rest of the decade at VFA club Prahran.

Robert Denno

Robert F. Denno (1945–2008) was an influential scientist in the field of entomology, specifically an insect ecologist. He wrote more than 130 research papers that helped advance the study of plant-insect interactions, interspecific competition, predator prey interactions and food web dynamics (Eubanks et al. 2011). He was a world-renowned authority on the ecology of sap-feeding insects, both in natural and cultivated settings. His study of wing polymorphism expanded into the fields of life history evolution (e.g., Denno and Dingle 1981), plant and herbivore interactions (e.g., Denno and McClure 1983), community ecology (e.g., Denno et al. 1996), and many aspects of predator ecology, reviewed recently in Denno et al. (2005).
His personal worldwide collection of butterflies numbered over 36,000 specimens. His butterfly collection was donated, at least in part, to the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity.
He was Assistant Professor at Rutgers University from 1974 to 1976, moving to the University of Maryland in 1976, advancing to Associate Professor in 1979 and Professor in 1985 in the Entomology Department.

SESAR’s target concept relies on a number of new key features:
The SESAR project has a parallel in the NextGen project within the United States.
History.
In the 20th century, contrary to the United States, Europe did not have a single sky — i.e., one in which air navigation is managed at the European level. Furthermore, European airspace is among the busiest in the world with over 33,000 flights on busy days and airport density in Europe is very high. This makes air traffic control even more complex.
The EU Single European Sky initiative was instigated to overcome this fragmentation and capacity limitation by structuring airspace and air navigation services at a pan-European level.
To prepare for future capacity, etc., the SESAR programme was initiated in 2004 (as a continuation of the Eurocontrol project SESAME).
In June 2010, European and American authorities reached a preliminary agreement on interoperability between their future air traffic management systems, SESAR and NextGen.

Arnold Strongman Classic

The Arnold Strongman Classic is one of the highest profile events featuring strength athletes in the world. Created by Dr. Terry Todd, it is an offshoot of the Arnold Sports Festival which takes place annually in Columbus, Ohio, USA. Instead of focusing on endurance, speed and athleticism like the World's Strongest Man, the competition is geared toward the heaviest instruments in the world to find out who truly is the strongest man.
History.
The Arnold Strongman Classic (which has been variously referred to as the "Arnold Strongman", the "Arnold Classic Strongman", "Arnold's Strength Summit" and "Arnold's Strongest Man") is one of the many offshoots of the Arnold Classic. The Arnold Sports Festival, founded in 1989 as the Arnold Classic and named after Arnold Schwarzenegger, was originally a bodybuilding contest. It featured a competition for men (Arnold Classic) and for women (Ms. International). The bodybuilding contests have since expanded to include a Fitness International and Figure International competition for women. However, the event had also expanded to include other sports and events, one of which was Strongman, introduced in 2002. The Strongman event was created by world famous powerlifter Dr. Terry Todd at the request of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The expansion of the programme led to the Classic becoming the Arnold Fitness Weekend and now the Arnold Sports Festival. According to the Arnold Sports Festival co-producer, Jim Lorimer: ""The Arnold Strongman Classic has been growing in popularity every year, and we are very excited that the world's best strong men are returning."" January 29, 2008
The "Arnold" as it is colloquially referred to in strength athletics, is one of the few neutral events on the strongman calendar in that it is not affiliated to any of the major strong man associations or producers. Athletes affiliated with the now defunct IFSA Strongman organization were not allowed to compete in the World's Strongest Man ("WSM"), which is produced by TWI and thus neither the WSM and its associated WSM Super Series nor the IFSA circuit could claim to have a comprehensive field of the top athletes. At the Arnold athletes from both organizations were allowed to compete together.
In 2002 the American wrestler and former weight lifter Mark Henry won the competition. In addition to competing what were the four official events - the Apollon's Wheel, the deadlift, the Hummer push and the 800+lbs Farmer's Walk (there are now six), the competitors were given the opportunity to attempt to lift the "Thomas Inch "unliftable" dumbbell", or "Inch Bell". A prize of $1000 was awarded to the man who could pull it the highest in the air. Five men chose to try the Bell with Mark Henry winning the $1000 by pulling it to the level of his chest. As an impromptu exhibition, Pfister took the Inch Bell to his chest with two hands and jerked it for which he received a standing ovation and was awarded by Jim Lorimer $1000.
From 2003 to 2008 Žydrūnas Savickas of Lithuania dominated over the international field. In 2008 he received a $40,000 check from Gerard Dente of MHP, an Audemars Piquet watch by Robert Ronan and the Louis Cyr trophy (after the legendary strongman, Louis Cyr) and congratulations from Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In the competition 12 world records were set with Savickas setting three of them. In the Tire Deadlift he lifted 1,027 lbs. In the Circus Dumbbell he tied with Derek Poundstone for the world record with nine lifts each, and in the Manhood Stones he lifted 525 lbs, three times.
American Derek Poundstone won in 2009 & 2010. Derek took the vacant throne from Zydrunas when he took 2009 off from the competition. When Savickas returned in 2010, Derek retained his title by defeating Zydrunas.
Just days before the 2011 contest, 2 time defending champion Derek Poundstone was forced to withdraw from the contest due to injury. Brian Shaw came in and won the contest, and Mike Jenkins, the winner of the 2010 Arnold Strongman amateur event who was competing in his first ever professional strongman competition, shocked many and finished in second place ahead of 6 time champion Zydrunas Savickas who came in third.

The Curecanti Needle is a distinct granite rock formation located in the Black Canyon of the Gunnison between Montrose and Gunnison, Colorado. A Colorado landmark, it rises steeply to a sharp point approximately above the canyon floor.
Until 1882, viewing the remote Needle presented a challenge, but the arrival of the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad mainlines through the canyon significantly improved accessibility. The train ride along the Gunnison River soon earned a reputation for its scenery, and the Curecanti Needle was featured in railroad company logos from 1887 to 1926. The Curecanti National Recreation Area was named for the Needle; the word "Curecanti" itself is said to come from the name of a Ute Indian chief.
In 1968, the Morrow Point Dam was completed about downstream from the Needle, and the elevated water level of the resulting Morrow Point Reservoir has somewhat changed the view from that shown on the 1884 photo at right. Trains no longer run through the Canyon, but the Curecanti Needle can be viewed from the Pioneer Point overlook off State Highway 92, or during a Morrow Point Boat Tour, offered by the National Park Service.

Chinese Cultural Centre, Calgary

The Chinese Cultural Centre is a building in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It is located on the north-eastern side of downtown and was completed in September 1992.
The centre piece of the complex is the "Dr. Henry Fok Cultural Hall", a building modeled after the Hall of Prayers of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. The 70 foot (21 m) high ceiling is decorated with 561 dragons and 40 phoenixes. It is supported by 4 columns with gold ornamentation representing each season. The outer surface of the dome is covered in blue tiles imported from China and crafted by the same company that endowed the Temple of Heaven during the Ming Dynasty 600 years ago. They were installed in traditional Chinese layered fashion and consolidated with mortar.
The second level of the building contains classrooms and a library with books in Chinese and English ("Orrin and Clara Christie Might Library"). The main level hosts a restaurant, a Chinese arts and crafts store and a traditional Chinese medicine facility.
Chinese Artifacts Museum.
The Chinese Artifacts Museum is located on the lower level of the centre. Exhibits include the story of Chinese immigration in Canada, and the history of the Chinese community in Calgary. There are also replicas of different kinds of Chinese artifacts, including furniture, ceramics, sculptures, clothing, bronze pieces and art.
History.
Interest for redevelopment of the area became acute in 1982, and in order to preserve the unique Chinese identity of the area, the City of Calgary and residents of the area came up with a redevelopment plan that would preserve the cultural identity and prevent Chinatown from being dominated by skyscrapers.
The original area redevelopment plan called for the reduction of Chinatown by 40% in area, so the community, together with city planning, produced a plan that included the construction of a large cultural centre. The plan was agreed upon by all involved parts.
The building was inaugurated in September 1992.

USS Mayfield Victory (AK-232)

USS "Mayfield Victory" (AK-232) was a "Boulder Victory"-class cargo ship acquired by the U.S. Navy during World War II. She served in the Pacific Ocean theatre of operations through the end of the war and then returned to the United States for disposal.
Victory built in California.
"Mayfield Victory" (AK 232) was laid down under U.S. Maritime Commission contract 10 August 1944 by Permanente Metals Corporation, Yard 1, Richmond, California; launched 10 October 1944; sponsored by Miss Evelyn Fuller; acquired by the Navy from the Maritime Commission under loan charter 19 November 1944; and commissioned the same day, Lt. Comdr. Niels H. Olsen, USNR, in command .
World War II operations.
Following shakedown off San Pedro, California, into December, "Mayfield Victory" loaded ammunition at Aberdeen, Washington, and at Puget Sound, Washington, before sailing for the South Pacific Ocean the 24th. She arrived Pearl Harbor 1 January 1945 to unload her cargo and 15 days later returned to the U.S. West Coast, arriving San Francisco, California, 22 January.
"Mayfield Victory" departed San Francisco 11 February for the Caroline Islands, via Eniwetok, the Marshall Islands, arriving Ulithi 3 March. She remained there until 13 April when she continued on to the Ryukyu Islands for the Okinawa campaign 1 April to 21 June, the second American objective in the “hop, skip, and jump” to the Empire of Japan warned against by Japanese Admiral Ito. The cargo ship spent 4 weeks in the area, operating with Task Group 50.8 until 23 April when she anchored in Kerama Retto. During the latter period "Mayfield Victory" continually issued ammunition, often under direct enemy air attack.
On 14 May "Mayfield Victory" steamed for Ulithi, arriving the 21st. Four days later she continued on to the Philippine Islands for a 30 day stopover at Leyte. The ship then returned to Kerama Retto 1 July. On 8 July she moved to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, where she remained on supply duty until late October.
On 25 October "Mayfield Victory" got underway for home, stopping at Seattle, Washington, in December before arriving San Francisco 9 February 1946. 
Post-war decommissioning.
She decommissioned 5 April and was delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) for U.S. Maritime Commission service into 1969 as a freighter operated by American Mail Line, Ltd., Seattle, Washington.

<doc id="19328945" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19328945" title="Fisher consistency">
Fisher consistency

In statistics, Fisher consistency, named after Ronald Fisher, is a desirable property of an estimator asserting that if the estimator were calculated using the entire population rather than a sample, the true value of the estimated parameter would be obtained. 
Definition.
Suppose we have a statistical sample "X"1, ..., "X""n" where each "X""i" follows a cumulative distribution "F""θ" which depends on an unknown parameter "θ". If an estimator of "θ" based on the sample can be represented as a functional of the empirical distribution function "F̂n":
the estimator is said to be "Fisher consistent" if: 
As long as the "X""i" are exchangeable, an estimator "T" defined in terms of the "X""i" can be converted into an estimator "T′" that can be defined in terms of "F̂n" by averaging "T" over all permutations of the data. The resulting estimator will have the same expected value as "T" and its variance will be no larger than that of "T".
If the strong law of large numbers can be applied, the empirical distribution functions "F̂n" converge pointwise to "Fθ", allowing us to express Fisher consistency as a limit — the estimator is "Fisher consistent" if
Finite population example.
Suppose our sample is obtained from a finite population "Z"1, ..., "Z"m. We can represent our sample of size "n" in terms of the proportion of the sample "n"i / "n" taking on each value in the population. Writing our estimator of θ as "T"("n"1 / "n", ..., "n"m / "n"), the population analogue of the estimator is "T"("p"1, ..., "p"m), where pi = "P"("X" = "Z"i). Thus we have "Fisher consistency" if "T"("p"1, ..., "p"m) = θ.
Suppose the parameter of interest is the expected value μ and the estimator is the sample mean, which can be written 
where "I" is the indicator function. The population analogue of this expression is 
so we have Fisher consistency.
Role in maximum likelihood estimation.
Maximising the likelihood function "L" gives an estimate that is Fisher consistent for a parameter "b" if
where "b"0 represents the true value of "b".
Relationship to asymptotic consistency and unbiasedness.
The term "consistency" in statistics usually refers to an estimator that is asymptotically consistent. Fisher consistency and asymptotic consistency are distinct concepts, although both aim to define a desirable property of an estimator. While many estimators are consistent in both senses, neither definition encompasses the other. For example, suppose we take an estimator "T"n that is both Fisher consistent and asymptotically consistent, and then form "T"n + "E"n, where "E"n is a deterministic sequence of nonzero numbers converging to zero. This estimator is asymptotically consistent, but not Fisher consistent for any "n". Alternatively, take a sequence of Fisher consistent estimators "S"n, then define "T"n = Sn for "n" < n0, and "T"n = "S"n0 for all "n" ≥"n"0. This estimator is Fisher consistent for all "n", but not asymptotically consistent. A concrete example of this construction would be estimating the population mean as "X"1 regardless of the sample size.
The sample mean is a Fisher consistent and unbiased estimate of the population mean, but not all Fisher consistent estimates are unbiased. Suppose we observe a sample from a uniform distribution on (0,θ) and we wish to estimate θ. The sample maximum is Fisher consistent, but downwardly biased. Conversely, the sample variance is an unbiased estimate of the population variance, but is not Fisher consistent.
Role in decision theory.
A loss function is Fisher consistent if the population minimizer of the risk leads to the Bayes optimal decision rule.

William Smith, 3rd Viscount Hambleden

William Henry Smith, 3rd Viscount Hambleden (25 July 1903 – 31 March 1948), was a British peer and descendant of the founders of stationery group W H Smith.
Early life and career.
Lord Hambleden was the 2nd child and eldest son of Frederick Smith and Esther Georgiana Caroline "nee" Gore (1870–1955), a daughter of Arthur Gore, 5th Earl of Arran. He was educated at Eton College and New College, Oxford.
After his father's death in 1928, the family business, W H Smith, was reconstituted as a limited company, in which Smith owned all the ordinary shares and was chairman. On his death in 1948, the death duties were so severe that a public holding company had to be formed and shares sold to W H Smith staff and the public. His younger brother, David John Smith, remained chairman until 1972, but the Smith family's control slipped away, and the last family member left the board in 1996.
Marriage and family.
His wife, Patricia Smith, Viscountess Hambleden was a Lady of the Bedchamber to HM Queen Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother. They had five children:
In 1961 his daughter, Katharine Smith, married the screenwriter Ivan Moffat, with whom she had two sons, Jonathan (born 1964) and Patrick Moffat (born 1968). The marriage was dissolved in 1972, and she married Peter Townend in 1973. One of her granddaughters (Jonathan's daughter) is Georgina Moffat.
He succeeded to the title of Viscount Hambleden following his father's death in 1928. He was succeeded by his eldest son, William Herbert.

<doc id="19328988" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19328988" title="AATSR">
AATSR

The Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) is one of the Announcement of Opportunity (AO) instruments on board the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Envisat satellite.
This instrument is a multi-channel imaging radiometer with the principal objective of providing data concerning global Sea Surface Temperature (SST) to the high levels of accuracy and stability required for monitoring and carrying out research into the behaviour of the Earth’s climate.
AATSR can measure Earth's surface temperature to a precision of , for climate research. Among the secondary objectives of AATSR is the observation of environmental parameters such as aerosols, clouds, fires, gas flares, water content, biomass, and vegetal health and growth.
AATSR is the successor of ATSR-1 and ATSR-2, payloads of ERS-1 and ERS-2.
Details.
The required accuracies are better than 0.3 °C with a stability approaching 0.1 °C /decade. Because of its wide angle lens it is possible to make very precise measurements of atmospheric effects on how emissions from the Earth's surface propagate.
In order to achieve this accuracy while viewing the Earth's surface through the atmosphere, AATSR views the surface at two angles, one close to the nadir (immediately below the satellite) and the other along the satellite track at close to 55° from the nadir, thereby providing two views of each point on the Earth's surface, each with a different effective atmospheric thickness. This dual-view system enables a particularly accurate estimate to be made of the signal degradation due to atmospheric absorption and scattering.
AATSR also embodies an exceptionally precise and stable on-board calibration system, comprising two reference targets specially designed for high uniformity and stability. These two targets, known as ‘black bodies’ are maintained at temperatures near to the extremes of the Earth temperatures as measured by AATSR and they are both viewed during each scan cycle of the instrument. This calibration system ensures that measurements of thermal radiation from the Earth’s surface are properly calibrated and do not rely on ground-based measurements, although such measurements are continually used to evaluate AATSR’s performance.
AATSR has three channels at thermal infrared wavelengths, from which surface temperatures are derived over both sea and land surfaces. In addition, AATSR has four visible and near-infrared wavelength channels which are used to identify cloudy areas and to measure solar radiation that is scattered and reflected from the Earth’s surface and atmosphere. These channels provide measurements from which land-cover properties, for example, NDVI, as well as clouds and atmospheric particulate matter (or aerosols) can be studied. The dual-view measurements provided by the along-track scanning technique is also a key feature of AATSR when used for atmospheric or vegetation measurements. As with the SST measurements, the two measurements of each point on the surface through different atmospheric path lengths greatly simplifies the task of separating the surface and atmospheric contributions to the measured signal. Thus the effects of atmospheric aerosols can be removed from surface products (such as surface reflectance or NDVI). Conversely, a similar approach can be used to account for the surface reflectance in determining aerosol or cloud properties. Additionally, the parallax between the two views can be used to determine cloud top and aerosol plume heights using geometric means.
AATSR is the third in a series of instruments started by ATSR-1, which was launched in 1991 on the European Remote-Sensing Satellite, ERS-1. This was followed by ATSR-2 on ERS-2 in 1995 and by AATSR on the Envisat satellite in 2002. The original ATSR-1 instrument lacked the three shortest wavelength channels provided by AATSR, whereas ATSR-2 was functionally identical. This has led to a near-continuous SST dataset extending from 1991 to the present day. Looking to the future, a successor instrument is being developed to fly on ESA’s Sentinel 3 satellite, which is part of the space segment of the European Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme. This will ensure the continuity of AATSR-standard SST data into the foreseeable future.
One of the most important aspects of the ATSR series of space instruments is that it has, over a period of just over 15 years, undergone the transition from experimental sensor on the ERS satellites, developing the technique and demonstrating the accuracy that can be achieved with along-track scanning, to that of an operational system, within Europe’s Envisat and future GMES Programmes.
The AATSR is a nationally-provided instrument, funded by the UK’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in order to support their programme of climate prediction and research. It was developed and is operated in collaboration with ESA. There is also a significant Australian contribution to the AATSR programme, now managed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. The predecessor instruments, ATSR-1 and ATSR-2, were funded by the UK's Science and Engineering Research Council. This funding responsibility was transferred to the UK's Natural Environment Research Council in 1993.
Successor.
The Sentinel 3 Earth observational satellite will house many earth observational instruments including SLSTR (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer) which is the successor to AATSR.

DDT in New Zealand

The use of DDT in New Zealand was banned in 1989 due to negative environmental impacts.
DDT.
DDT is an organochlorine insecticide that does not occur naturally. It is a persistent organic pollutant (POP) with a half life of 2–15 years. Concerns were raised about its use in the 1940s but the publication of Rachael Carson's book "Silent Spring" was the catalyst leading to DDT being banned. DDT was first banned in Hungary in 1968 then in Norway and Sweden in 1970, the US in 1972 and the United Kingdom in 1984.
Usage.
DDT was used extensively for agricultural use in the 1950s and 1960s to control grass grub and porina moth. It was also used on lawns and for market gardens. Some 500 tons was being applied annually by 1959. By the 1970s its use was restricted and it was finally banned in 1989.
Residues.
There was increasing evidence, especially in the 1970s, that there was DDT residues in aquatic organisms, including trout and eels. Being bioaccumulative DDT passes up the food chain and organisms at higher trophic levels end up with high concentrations of the pesticide.
Some Canterbury and Southland farms have elevated levels of DDT and a programme run by the Ministry of Agriculture ensures that exported meat and dairy produce have low levels of these residues. During dry periods animals ingest soil since grass is shorter and sparser and the DDT residue on the soil is retained by the animal. In the 1980s 40% of the lambs in Canterbury, a region with low rainfall and occasional droughts, had DDT levels that were above the European Union's permitted limit but still acceptable under safe tolerance limits for New Zealand.
Mapua was one of the most contaminated sites in New Zealand due to pesticide residues in the soils from a now defunct factory. In the 1940s organomercury and organochlorine pesticides, including DDT, DDD, dieldrin, 2,4-D and paraquat, were produced. The factory closed in 1988 and the site was subjected to a major cleanup operation in the 2000s.
DDT has also been found in the endangered Hectors dolphin which inhabits the coastal regions on New Zealand.
Stockholm Convention.
The New Zealand government has signed and ratified the Stockholm Convention which controls the production and use of persistent organic pesticides, and therefore includes DDT. It came into law on 23 December 2004. Article 3.1(b) of the Convention restricts the production and use of DDT but since there is no intention to use DDT in New Zealand there is no action required under the Convention.

Dornoch Firth Bridge

The Dornoch Firth Bridge is a road bridge over the Dornoch Firth, carrying traffic between Tain and Dornoch.
History.
It was built for the Scottish Office. There had been recent substantial improvements of the A9 between Inverness and Tain, including the cable-stayed Kessock Bridge at Inverness in 1982. The Dornoch Bridge was to be the final link in the chain. Tenders were open to bid from 1986. 40 companies showed an interest in the contract. Ove Arup and Crouch Hogg Waterman of Glasgow produced a set of initial design parameters for companies to build. The joint-venture chosen to build the bridge put in a quote for £9.5 million, and won the contract in early 1988.
Design.
Each of the 21 spans is about 44 metres long. The Project Manager was Nigel Beaney of Christiani & Nielsen. Pre-stressed concrete rather than steel was chosen as the material to improve the life of the bridge. The design had to be approved by the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland.
Construction.
It was built by a joint venture of Christiani & Nielsen. It cost £13.5 million (£ million current value). At the time it was one of the longest bridges in Europe built with the cast-and-push method, or incremental launch. 
The bridge deck was built in a temporary factory 20 metres south of the southern end of the bridge. Each section of the bridge was pushed with 600 tonnes of hydraulic force over PTFE bearings on the top of the bridge supports. The launch nose section had a light steel composition to reduce the cantilever moment as it was inched over an open span. Each deck section was constructed as around 21 metres in length - half a span. The concrete used welded mat reinforcement. The pres-stressing of each section had 38 Macalloy bar tendons of 40mm thickness. The sections would be cast on a Monday morning and pushed on a Friday, this later being on a Thursday. Each deck section weighed around 14,000 tonnes.
Opening.
It was opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on Tuesday 27 August 1991. The bridge replaced, via a roundabout with the A836 to the south and a road junction with the A949 to the north, the 26-mile round trip over Bonar Bridge.

Womanizer (song)

"Womanizer" is a song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her sixth studio album, "Circus" (2008). It was released on September 26, 2008 by Jive Records as the lead single of the album. Produced and co-written by Nikesha Briscoe and Rafael Akinyemi of The Outsyders, the song was re-recorded after a snippet was leaked onto the internet. "Womanizer" is an uptempo earworm electropop song with characteristic sirens and a repetitive hook. Described by Spears as a girl anthem, the song's lyrics recall a womanizing man, while the protagonist of the song makes clear she knows who he really is. "Womanizer" was well received by contemporary critics, with reviewers praising its hook, melody and empowering lyrics. Critics also observed it was a stand-out track from its album and also deemed it as a comeback single for Spears.
"Womanizer" was a commercial success, peaking atop of the charts in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway, Sweden and the United States. It also reached the top ten in every country it charted in also receiving several certifications from several countries. In the United States, "Womanizer" was her first single to reach number-one since "...Baby One More Time" in 1999. The song broke the record for the highest jump to number one at a time which was later broken by Kelly Clarkson's "My Life Would Suck Without You" in 2009. It is also her best-selling digital song in the country, having sold over 3.3 million copies, and over 5 million copies around the globe, making it one of the best-selling singles worldwide.
The music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, was created by Spears as a sequel to the music video of "Toxic". It portrays Spears as a woman who disguises herself in different costumes and follows her boyfriend through his daily activities to expose him in the end. The video also contains interspersed scenes of Spears naked in a steam room, as a response to the attacks she had received over the years about her weight. It received positive reviews and was considered as a return to form for Spears. The video was also nominated for two categories at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, and went on to win Best Pop Video.
The song has been covered by a number of artists from different genres, including Lily Allen, Franz Ferdinand and Girls Aloud. Spears performed "Womanizer" on several television shows including "The X Factor" and "Good Morning America", as well as award shows such as the 2008 Bambi Awards. She has also performed the song at The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), the Femme Fatale Tour (2011) and (2013). "Womanizer" received a Grammy nomination in 2010 in the Best Dance Recording category, but lost to Lady Gaga's "Poker Face".
Background.
The song was written and co-produced by Nikesha Briscoe and Rafael Akinyemi of the production team, The Outsyders. Spears recorded main vocals with Brendan Dakora at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, California and Bojan "Genius" Dugic at Legacy Studios in New York City. Pro Tools engineering was done by John Hanes, assisted by Tim Roberts. On September 19, 2008, a low quality 37 second snippet of the song was posted on the official website of 107.5 The River, a radio station in Lebanon, Tennessee. According to Jive Records, a representative of the label played a rough mix of the song for people at the station, who recorded it and leaked it on the Internet. The snippet was later removed from the website. The song was scheduled to premiere on September 23, 2008, but the release was delayed when Spears went into the studio to re-record some vocals. The new recordings were done with Jim Beanz and Marcella "Ms. Lago" Araica. The song was finally mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia. "Womanizer" was officially sent to radio stations on September 26, 2008. A few days later, Spears talked about it during a live interview with New York's Z100 on October 18, 2008, stating, "It's basically saying, 'We know what you're up to.' It's about guys cheating on girls, it's a girl anthem. That's why I like it".
Music and lyrics.
"Womanizer" is an uptempo electropop song with dark synths that runs through a dance oriented beat. It has been compared to previous Spears' songs such as "Toxic" (2003) and "Ooh Ooh Baby" (2007). It is written in the verse–pre-chorus–chorus form. The track opens with its characteristical sirens. According to Ann Powers of the "Los Angeles Times", Spears "quick-witted" vocals are similar to the style of The Andrews Sisters. It was also noted by "Daily News" writer Jim Farber that Spears' delivery has a "tone of petulance". After the bridge, Spears sings the chorus one more time and the song ends while the beat drops and Spears sings the "you’re a womanizer, baby" hook. The song is composed in the key of C#minor with 139 beats per minute. The chord progression in the song is C#m-F#m-E-Eb-D.
Lyrically, the song refers to a womanizing man. It has been suggested that the lyrics address Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline.
Critical reception.
Peter Robinson of "The Observer" gave the song the maximum five stars referring to it as a "comeback single" and as having a "genius hook". He added that the song "been called lazy, largely by misinformed people who also think that Kylie's 'la la la's would have been better with proper words". Popjustice compared it to "Some Girls" by Rachel Stevens and added "[The track lays a really strong foundation for the realised comeback that didn't quite happen last time and it's hard not to think of it as a late contender for single of the year. [...] It's literally quite good". Myrddin Gwynedd of "The New Zealand Herald" said "it's got hit written all over it". On the week of November 24, 2008, the "Derby Telegraph" chose it as single of the week. In the album review, Nekesa Mumbi Moody of "The Providence Journal" said that along with "Shattered Glass", they were " fun disco tracks".
"USA Today" writer Steve Jones named it one of the standout tracks of the album and commented that "she seems most at ease when she's playing the teasing tart". Talia Kraines of the BBC commented that Spears needed more songs like "Womanizer", saying "Britney 2.0 needs to be full of wild dancefloor driven moves". Simon Price of "The Independent" commented the song borrows its electronic sound from Goldfrapp. Ann Powers of the "Los Angeles Times" complimented Spears' delivery and the lyrics, saying the song is "about the kind of girl power that's focused on besting one obnoxious man, is also vintage and contemporary at the same time – more feminism as individualism". Mike Newmark of PopMatters called the song " a meaty, high-voltage shuffler helmed by the Outsyders, who do an admirable job of recreating the chemistry of Spears and Danja on last year’s single 'Gimme More'".
Jim Farber of the "Daily News" said the pre-chorus was the most repetitive in a pop song since The Shaggs's "Gimmie Dat Ding". Jim Abbott of the "Orlando Sentinel" called it "basically an adult update of her teen-pop tease act". Ian Watson of Dotmusic wrote that Spears sounded "trapped on this single. Not trapped, as in desperate and distraught, but trapped as in literally frozen – like she's been placed into a robot on a production line and she has to sing these words, dance these steps, work it like this, until the spotlight snaps off and the factory's powered down for the night". The song has been nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Dance Recording on December 2, 2009. Spears had previously won the category in the 2005 ceremony for her single "Toxic". However, it lost to Lady Gaga's "Poker Face".
Commercial performance.
In the United States, the song entered the "Billboard" Hot 100 at number ninety-six on the issue dated October 8, 2008.

Rihanna) and Beyoncé and Shakira's "Beautiful Liar", respectively. The record was later broken by Kelly Clarkson's "My Life Would Suck Without You". It also garnered first-week download sales of 286,000, the biggest opening-week tally by a female artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking digital downloads in 2003, surpassing the record previously held by Mariah Carey's "Touch My Body".

Music video.
Development.
The music video was filmed on September 24 and 25, 2008 in Los Angeles, directed by Joseph Kahn, who previously worked with Spears for the music videos of "Stronger" and "Toxic". According to Kahn, Spears pitched him her original concept, which included all the main elements used in the final version. Spears thought of the video as a sequel to "Toxic", as seen in her documentary "", whereas Kahn approached it as "a 2008 answer" to the previous clip. He added that, "'Toxic' was a crystallization of her career at that time, [...] There are elements and moments of that I felt could been improved. ['Womanizer'] is a bit more fashion-forward". About how the concept of the video related to their previous work, Kahn commented that "It's just a great girl fantasy. There are things she's really good at, like having a really natural knack for knowing what girls want. [...] It's a much more mature sound and much more mature lyrics, and she always has the greatest ideas. She's hyper-aware of pop culture". The costumes and looks for each of the different women were chosen by Spears and Kahn. The scenes in the sauna were suggested by Kahn, as a response to the attacks Spears received over the years about her weight. He stated, "I knew that the whole world would be watching, so I wanted something in there that stated, 'This is Britney, this is why you should respect her'". The set was cleared for two hours, leaving her and Kahn alone shooting the sequence. Kahn also decided to end the video with an image of Spears smiling, because "We just needed to tell everybody she's OK". A censored version of the music video premiered on October 10, 2008 on ABC's "20/20" at the end of their show. The uncensored version premiered on MTV the same night.
Synopsis.
The video begins with an opening caption that reads "Womanizer". During the introduction, Spears is naked and smiling at a sauna, while covering herself with her hands. These scenes are seen throughout the video. When the first verse begins, the official version of Spears wearing a slip nightgown is making breakfast for her boyfriend as he gets ready for work. When he is at the office, he sees a new secretary, which is actually Spears in disguise wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a pencil skirt. She starts dancing in front of him and sings the chorus. She makes him follow her into the photocopier, where she photocopies her buttocks. On the back, we see an awkward-looking man, the same who appears in the plane scene on "Toxic". Then, Spears is disguised as a red-haired, tattooed waitress in a restaurant. She dances around him with her dancers and plays with him over the kitchen counter. After this, her boyfriend is seen getting driven home by Spears, disguised as a chauffeur. She starts to kiss him, driving the car with her heel until both get home. Once they get into the bedroom, Spears reveals that she was the three women he was "womanizing" all along. She then begins attacking her boyfriend. This is shown through Spears as her three alter egos, and then as the real version of herself. Spears throws a blanket over her boyfriend and makes the bed. The video ends with Spears smiling, and a repeat of the opening caption.
Reception.
Margeaux Watson of "Entertainment Weekly" said the video "looks promising. [...] The dancing is stiff and minimal, a disappointment since her moves are her strong suit. But this is a welcome return to the Britney we love – gorgeous, gyrating, greased up, and gamely playing the vamp". "OK!" commented that "in addition to seeing Brit in three different sexy getups, the video [...] features an oiled-up Britney writhing around in nothing but a smile". "Rolling Stone" said the video was "a cross between 'Toxic' and "The Office"" and added, "she’s dancing looking like the old Britney". Courtney Hazlett of msnbc.com claimed "When Spears isn’t shown naked and writhing in a steam room, she’s fired up". "TV Guide" writer Adam Bryant said that "the music video features some of the most strategically placed hands in music-video history [... video is quite a return to form for the troubled pop star". The music video for "Womanizer" became a worldwide success right after it premiered on the Internet, gaining seven million viewers in less than 48 hours. The music video was listed as the best video of 2008 in polls by MTV and Fuse TV. It won Music Video of the Year at the 2009 NRJ Music Awards. The video was also nominated for Best Pop Video and Video of the Year at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. It lost the latter category to Beyoncé's "Single Ladies", but won Best Pop Video.
Live performances.
The song was performed for the first time at the Bambi Awards in Germany, on November 27, 2008. For the performance Spears wore hot pants, fishnet stockings and a black top hat. The ensemble was compared to the costume Madonna wore during the first act of her Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008–09). Spears was also presented with an award for Best International Popstar by Karl Lagerfeld, who said, "I admire you ... not just for your art, but for your energy. are coming back not only as a phoenix but as a bird of paradise". The following night, Spears performed the song at "Star Academy", with similar choreography and dance moves but wearing a red strapless dress. On November 30, 2008, Spears performed at "The X Factor". The performance was watched by over thirteen million UK citizens, making it the most viewed episode in the show’s history. On December 2, 2008, she performed the song at "Good Morning America" along with a performance of "Circus". On December 15, 2008, she performed at the Japanese music show "Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ". The following day, she performed at "NTV Best Artist 2008" in a black and gold bra, hot pants and a white top hat. She also sported a fake tattooed heart in her cheek.
The song was a major part in The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), as the encore of the show. After a video interlude of Spears's music videos set to "Break the Ice" ended, Spears appeared wearing a police officer uniform designed by Dean and Dan Caten, with black sunglasses, a hat with her trademark logo and sequined handcuffs. Her female dancers were also dressed as policewomen, while her male dancers were dressed as criminals. During the performance, she danced and flirted with the male dancers. At the end of the song, she returned to the main stage while her dancers surrounded her and a shower of sparks fell over them. She thanked the audience and bowed to each side of the arena. She left the stage with an instrumental version of "Circus" playing in the background. Jane Stevenson of the "Toronto Sun" praised the performance for being a standout number in the show.
"Womanizer" was also performed at the Femme Fatale Tour (2011) as the last song of the fourth act. Following "I Wanna Go", which featured her dancing with members of the audience onstage, Spears performed "Womanizer" while surrounded by her dancers dressed as police officers. Shirley Halperin of "The Hollywood Reporter" stated that "mid-tempo numbers [... seemed to stall out quickly, where faster offerings like 'Womanizer,' 'I Wanna Go' and 'Toxic' had the sold out crowd jumping in place and pumping their number twos in the air." Ed Masley of "The Arizona Republic" called the back-to-back performances of "I Wanna Go" and "Womanizer" "a triumphant double shot of dance-pop greatness." Keith Caufireld of "Billboard" said the performance "seemed a bit flat after the crowd-wowing 'I Wanna Go.'" Spears is currently performing Womanizer as the second song for her Las Vegas Residency, at The AXIS.
Cover versions and influence.
"Womanizer" has been covered by many artists from a variety of music genres, as well as a great number of amateurs. Clark Collis of "Entertainment Weekly" explained that "the song has been covered by other artists with an enthusiasm only matched in recent times by musicians’ desire to remake Radiohead’s 'Creep' in their own image". On December 8, 2008, New Zealand singer Ladyhawke performed a cover at BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. The song was covered by American band The All-American Rejects on the Yahoo! Music Pepsi Smash show in December 2008. It was performed in an acoustic version, in which the band members played percussions with beer bottles. The cover also included an excerpt from The Turtles's "Happy Together". British singer Lily Allen also covered the song, because "simple really, I love Britney and I love the song". Her cover was a stripped down version, that according to Nick Levine of Digital Spy, "might provoke those who reckon it doesn't have much of a chorus to revise their opinion". Allen also performed the song as the encore during her 2009 tour. French singer Sliimy cover was deemed as an "indie makeover". He would later be the opening act of the second Paris date at The Circus Starring Britney Spears.
On January 13, 2009, English singer Ana Silvera covered the song during one of her London concerts.
On April 6, 2009, Scottish band Franz Ferdinand also covered the song at Radio 1's Live Lounge. Lead singer Alex Kapranos claimed "It's been the best song out in the last few months". It was also covered regularly by them during their 2009 American spring tour. The song was performed live by UK girl group Girls Aloud during their Out of Control Tour, starting April 24, 2009. Their version was released on their 2009 live album "". "Womanizer" was also covered by Fall Out Boy, among others. "Weird Al" Yankovic also covered this song for part of the polka medley off his latest album "Alpocalypse". In the 2012 "Glee" episode "Britney 2.0", actors Melissa Benoist, Alex Newell and Jenna Ushkowitz performed a cover of the song.

Marvin's Room (play)

"Marvin's Room" is a play written by Scott McPherson. It concerns two sisters, Bessie, their father's saintly caretaker who has leukemia, and Lee, a wisecracking, psychologically unstable free spirit who has not helped with the caretaking. It is based upon McPherson's experiences with older relatives who lived in Florida. McPherson cared for his partner, cartoonist and activist Daniel Sotomayor, who died from AIDS. His experiences living in the darkest days of the AIDS epidemic influenced his writing. McPherson himself died in 1992 of AIDS at age 33.
"Marvin's Room" had its premiere in Chicago in 1990, directed by David Petrarca. It then played off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons, opening on 15 November 1991. It went on to run at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.

AutoCAD Architecture

AutoCAD Architecture (abbreviated as ACA) is a version of Autodesk's flagship product, AutoCAD, with tools and functions specially suited to architectural work.
Architectural objects have a relationship to one another and interact with each other intelligently. For example, a window has a relationship to the wall that contains it. If you move or delete the wall, the window reacts accordingly. Objects can be represented in both 2D and 3D.
In addition, intelligent architectural objects maintain dynamic links with construction documents and specifications, resulting in more accurate project deliverables. When someone deletes or modifies a door, for example, the door schedule can be automatically updated. Spaces and areas update automatically when certain elements are changed, calculations such as square footage are always up to date.
AutoCAD Architecture uses the DWG file format but an object enabler is needed to access, display, and manipulate object data in applications different from AutoCAD Architecture.
AutoCAD Architecture was formerly known as AutoCAD Architectural Desktop (often abbreviated ADT) but Autodesk changed its name for the 2008 edition. The change was made to better match the names of Autodesk's other discipline-specific packages, such as AutoCAD Electrical and AutoCAD Mechanical.

His mother, Reba Louise (née Wood), was a gift shop manager, and his mother's second husband, Louis Claude Rove, Jr. (1928–2004), who adopted him and whom Rove knew as his father, was a geologist.
In 1965, his family moved to Salt Lake City, where Rove entered high school, becoming a skilled debater. Rove described his high school years as "I was the complete nerd. I had the briefcase. I had the pocket protector. I wore Hush Puppies when they were not cool. I was the thin, scrawny little guy. I was definitely uncool." Encouraged by a teacher to run for class senate, Rove won the election. As part of his campaign strategy he rode in the back of a convertible inside the school gymnasium sitting between two attractive girls before his election speech. While at Olympus High School, he was elected student council president his junior and senior years. Rove was also a Teenage Republican and served as Chairman of the Utah Federation of Teenage Republicans.
Entry into politics.
Rove began his involvement in American politics in 1968. In a 2002 "Deseret News" interview, Rove explained, "I was the Olympus High chairman for (former United States Senator) Wallace F. Bennett's re-election campaign, where he was opposed by the dynamic, young, aggressive political science professor at the University of Utah, J.D. Williams." Bennett was reelected to a third six-year term in November 1968. Through Rove's campaign involvement, Bennett's son, Bob Bennett—a future United States Senator from Utah—would become a friend. Williams would later become a mentor to Rove.
In December 1969, the man Rove had known as his father left the family, and divorced Rove's mother soon afterwards. After his parents' divorce, Rove learned from his aunt and uncle that the man who had raised him was not his biological father; both he and his older brother Eric were the children of another man. Rove has expressed great love and admiration for his adoptive father and for "how selfless" his love had been. On September 11, 1981, Rove's mother committed suicide in Reno, Nevada.
College and the Dixon campaign incident.
In the fall of 1969, Rove entered the University of Utah, on a $1,000 scholarship, as a political science major and joined the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. Through the University's Hinckley Institute of Politics, he got an internship with the Utah Republican Party. That position, and contacts from the 1968 Bennett campaign, helped him land a job in 1970 on Ralph Tyler Smith's unsuccessful re-election campaign for Senate from Illinois against Democrat Adlai E. Stevenson III.
In the fall of 1970, Rove used a false identity to enter the campaign office of Democrat Alan J. Dixon, who was running for Treasurer of Illinois. He stole 1000 sheets of paper with campaign letterhead, printed fake campaign rally fliers promising "free beer, free food, girls and a good time for nothing", and distributed them at rock concerts and homeless shelters, with the effect of disrupting Dixon's rally. (Dixon eventually won the election). Rove's role would not become publicly known until August 1973 when Rove told the "Dallas Morning News". In 1999 he said, "It was a youthful prank at the age of 19 and I regret it." In his memoir, Rove wrote that when he was later nominated to the Board for International Broadcasting by President George H.W. Bush, Senator Dixon did not kill his nomination. In Rove's account, "Dixon displayed more grace than I had shown and kindly excused this youthful prank."
College Republicans, Watergate, and the Bushes.
In June 1971, after the end of the semester, Rove dropped out of the University of Utah to take a paid position as the Executive Director of the College Republican National Committee. Joe Abate, who was National Chairman of the College Republicans at the time, became his mentor. Rove then enrolled at the University of Maryland in College Park in the Fall of 1971, but withdrew from classes during the first half of the semester.
Rove traveled extensively, participating as an instructor at weekend seminars for campus conservatives across the country. He was an active participant in Richard Nixon's 1972 Presidential campaign. A CBS report on the organization of the Nixon campaign from June 1972 includes an interview with a young Rove working for the College Republican National Committee.
Rove held the position of executive director of the College Republicans until early 1973. He left the job to spend five months, without pay, campaigning full-time for the position of national chairman during the time he attended George Mason University. Lee Atwater, the group's Southern regional coordinator, who was two months younger than Rove, managed Rove's campaign. The two spent the spring of 1973 crisscrossing the country in a Ford Pinto, lining up the support of Republican state chairs.
The College Republicans summer 1973 convention at the Lake of the Ozarks resort in Missouri was quite contentious. Rove's opponent was Robert Edgeworth of Michigan. The other major candidate, Terry Dolan of California, dropped out, supporting Edgeworth. A number of states had sent two competing delegates, because Rove and his supporters had made credential challenges at state and regional conventions. For example, after the Midwest regional convention, Rove forces had produced a version of the Midwestern College Republicans constitution which differed significantly from the constitution that the Edgeworth forces were using, in order to justify the unseating of the Edgeworth delegates on procedural grounds, including delegations, such as Ohio and Missouri, which had been certified earlier by Rove himself. In the end, there were two votes, conducted by two convention chairs, and two winners—Rove and Edgeworth, each of whom delivered an acceptance speech. After the convention, both Edgeworth and Rove appealed to Republican National Committee Chairman George H. W. Bush, each contending that he was the new College Republican chairman.
While resolution was pending, Dolan went (anonymously) to the "Washington Post" with recordings of several training seminars for young Republicans where a co-presenter of Rove's, Bernie Robinson, cautioned against doing the same thing he had done: rooting through opponents' garbage cans. The tape with this story on it, as well as Rove's admonition not to copy similar tricks as Rove's against Dixon, was secretly recorded and edited by Rich Evans, who had hoped to receive an appointment from Rove's competitor in the CRNC chairmanship race. On August 10, 1973, in the midst of the Watergate scandal, the "Post" broke the story in an article titled "GOP Party Probes Official as Teacher of Tricks".
In response, then RNC Chairman George H.W. Bush, had an FBI agent question Rove. As part of the investigation, Atwater signed an affidavit, dated August 13, 1973, stating that he had heard a "20 minute anecdote similar to the one described in the "Washington Post"" in July 1972, but that "it was a funny story during a coffee break". Former Nixon White House Counsel John Dean, has been quoted as saying "based on my review of the files, it appears the Watergate prosecutors were interested in Rove's activities in 1972, but because they had bigger fish to fry they did not aggressively investigate him."
On September 6, 1973, three weeks after announcing his intent to investigate the allegations against Rove, George H.W. Bush chose him to be chairman of the College Republicans. Bush then wrote Edgeworth a letter saying that he had concluded that Rove had fairly won the vote at the convention. Edgeworth wrote back, asking about the basis of that conclusion. Not long after that, Edgeworth stated "Bush sent me back the angriest letter I have ever received in my life. I had leaked to the "Washington Post", and now I was out of the Party forever."
As National Chairman, Rove introduced Bush to Atwater, who had taken Rove's job as the College Republican's executive director, and who would become Bush's main campaign strategist in future years. Bush hired Rove as a Special Assistant in the Republican National Committee, a job Rove left in 1974 to become Executive Assistant to the co-chair of the RNC, Richard D. Obenshain.
As Special Assistant, Rove performed small personal tasks for Bush. In November 1973, he asked Rove to take a set of car keys to his son George W. Bush, who was visiting home during a break from Harvard Business School. It was the first time the two met. "Huge amounts of charisma, swagger, cowboy boots, flight jacket, wonderful smile, just charisma - you know, wow", Rove recalled years later.
The Texas years and notable political campaigns.
1977–1991.
Rove's initial job in Texas was in 1977 as a legislative aide for Fred Agnich, a Texas Republican state representative from Dallas. Later that same year, Rove got a job as executive director of the Fund for Limited Government, a political action committee (PAC) in Houston headed by James A. Baker, III, a Houston lawyer (later President George H. W. Bush's Secretary of State). The PAC eventually became the genesis of the Bush-for-President campaign of 1979–1980.
His work for William Clements during the Texas gubernatorial election of 1978 helped Clements become the first Republican Governor of Texas in over 100 years. Clements was elected to a four-year term, succeeding Democrat Dolph Briscoe. Rove was deputy director of the Governor William P. Clements Junior Committee in 1979 and 1980, and deputy executive assistant to the governor of Texas (roughly, Deputy Chief of Staff) in 1980 and 1981.
In 1981, Rove founded a direct mail consulting firm, Karl Rove & Co., in Austin. The firm's first clients included Texas Governor Bill Clements and Democratic congressman Phil Gramm, who later became a Republican congressman and United States Senator. Rove operated his consulting business until 1999, when he sold the firm to take a full-time position in George W. Bush's presidential campaign.
Between 1981 and 1999, Rove worked on hundreds of races. Most were in a supporting role, doing direct mail fundraising. A November 2004 "Atlantic Monthly" article estimated that he was the primary strategist for 41 statewide, congressional, and national races, and Rove's candidates won 34 races.
Rove also did work during those years for non-political clients. From 1991 to 1996, Rove advised tobacco giant Philip Morris, and ultimately earned $3,000 a month via a consulting contract. In a deposition, Rove testified that he severed the tie in 1996 because he felt awkward "about balancing that responsibility with his role as Bush's top political advisor" while Bush was governor of Texas and Texas was suing the tobacco industry.
1978 George W. Bush congressional campaign.
Rove advised the younger Bush during his unsuccessful Texas congressional campaign in 1978.
1980 George H. W. Bush presidential campaign.
In 1977, Rove was the first person hired by George H. W. Bush for his unsuccessful 1980 presidential campaign, which ended with Bush as the vice-presidential nominee.
1982 William Clements, Jr. gubernatorial campaign.
In 1982, Bill Clements ran for reelection, but was defeated by Democrat Mark White.
1982 Phil Gramm congressional campaign.
In 1982, Phil Gramm was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a conservative Texas Democrat.
1984 Phil Gramm senatorial campaign.
In 1984, Rove helped Gramm, who had become a Republican in 1983, defeat Republican Ron Paul in the primary and Democrat Lloyd Doggett in the race for U.S. Senate.
1984 Ronald Reagan presidential campaign.
Rove handled direct-mail for the Reagan-Bush campaign.
1986 William Clements, Jr. gubernatorial campaign.
In 1986, Rove helped Clements become governor a second time. In a strategy memo Rove wrote for his client prior to the race, now among Clements's papers in the Texas A&M University library, Rove quoted Napoleon: "The whole art of war consists in a well-reasoned and extremely circumspect defensive, followed by rapid and audacious attack."
In 1986, just before a crucial debate in campaign, Rove claimed that his office had been bugged by Democrats. The police and FBI investigated and discovered that the bug's battery was so small that it needed to be changed every few hours, and the investigation was dropped. Critics, including other Republican operatives, suspected Rove had bugged his own office to garner sympathy votes in the close governor's race.
1988 Texas Supreme Court races.
In 1988, Rove helped Thomas R. Phillips become the first Republican elected as Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court. Phillips had been appointed to the position in November 1987 by Clements. Phillips was re-elected in 1990, 1996 and 2002.
Phillips' election in 1988 was part of an aggressive grassroots campaign called "Clean Slate '88", a conservative effort that was successful in getting five of its six candidates elected. (Ordinarily there were three justices on the ballot each year, on a nine-justice court, but, because of resignations, there were six races for the Supreme Court on the ballot in November 1988.) By 1998, Republicans held all nine seats on the Court.
1990 Texas gubernatorial campaign.
In 1989, Rove encouraged George W. Bush to run for Texas governor, brought in experts to tutor him on policy, and introduced him to local reporters. Eventually, Bush decided not to run, and Rove backed another Republican for governor who lost in the primary.
Other 1990 Texas statewide races.
In 1990, two other Rove candidates won: Rick Perry, the future governor of the state, became agricultural commissioner, and Kay Bailey Hutchison became state treasurer.
One notable aspect of the 1990 election was the charge that Rove had asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate major Democratic officeholders in Texas. In his autobiography, Rove called the whole thing a "myth", saying:
1991 Richard L. Thornburgh senatorial campaign and lawsuit.
In 1991, United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh resigned to run for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, one made vacant by John Heinz's death in a helicopter crash. Rove's company worked for the campaign, but it ended with an upset loss to Democrat Harris Wofford. Rove subsequently sued Thornburgh alleging non-payment for services rendered. The Republican National Committee, worried that the suit would make it hard to recruit good candidates, urged Rove to back off. When Rove refused, the RNC hired Kenneth Starr to write an amicus brief on Thornburgh's behalf. After a trial in Austin, Rove prevailed. "Karl Rove & Co. v. Thornburgh" was heard by U.S. Federal Judge Sam Sparks (who had been appointed by George H.W. Bush in 1991).
1992 George H. W. Bush presidential campaign.
Rove was fired from the 1992 Bush presidential campaign after he planted a negative story with columnist Robert Novak about dissatisfaction with campaign fundraising chief Robert Mosbacher Jr. ("Esquire Magazine", January 2003). Novak provided some evidence of motive in his column describing the firing of Mosbacher by former Senator Phil Gramm: "Also attending the session was political consultant Karl Rove, who had been shoved aside by Mosbacher." Novak and Rove deny that Rove was the leaker, but Mosbacher maintained that "Rove is the only one with a motive to leak this. We let him go. I still believe he did it."
During testimony before the CIA leak grand jury, Rove apparently confirmed his prior involvement with Novak in the 1992 campaign leak, according to "National Journal" reporter Murray Waas.
1993–2000.
1993 Kay Bailey Hutchison senatorial campaign
Rove helped Hutchison win a special Senate election in June 1993. Hutchison defeated Democrat Bob Krueger to fill the last two years of Lloyd Bentsen's term. Bentsen resigned to become Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton administration.
1994 Alabama Supreme Court races
In 1994, a group called the Business Council of Alabama hired Rove to help run a slate of Republican candidates for the state supreme court. No Republican had been elected to that court in more than a century. The campaign by the Republicans was unprecedented in the state, which had previously only seen low-key contests. After the election, a court battle over absentee and other ballots followed that lasted more than 11 months. It ended when a federal appeals court judge ruled that disputed absentee ballots could not be counted, and ordered the Alabama Secretary of State to certify the Republican candidate for Chief Justice, Perry Hooper, as the winner. An appeal to the Supreme Court by the Democratic candidate was turned down within a few days, making the ruling final. Hooper won by 262 votes.
Another candidate, Harold See, ran against Mark Kennedy, an incumbent Democratic justice and the son-in-law of George Wallace. The race included charges that Kennedy was mingling campaign funds with those of a non-profit children's foundation he was involved with. A former Rove staffer reported that some within the See camp initiated a whisper campaign that Kennedy was a pedophile. Kennedy won by less than one percentage point.
1994 John Ashcroft senatorial campaign
In 1993, according to the "New York Times", Karl Rove & Company was paid $300,000 in consulting fees by Ashcroft's successful 1994 Senate campaign. Ashcroft paid Rove's company more than $700,000 over the course of three campaigns.
1994 George W. Bush gubernatorial campaign
In 1993, Rove began advising George W. Bush in his successful campaign to become governor of Texas. Bush announced his candidacy in November 1993. By January 1994, Bush had spent more than $600,000 on the race against incumbent Democrat Ann Richards, with $340,000 of that paid to Rove's firm.
Rove has been accused of using the push poll technique to call voters to ask such things as whether people would be "more or less likely to vote for Governor Richards if knew her staff is dominated by lesbians". Rove has denied having been involved in circulating these rumors about Richards during the campaign, although many critics nonetheless identify this technique, particularly as utilized in this instance against Richards, as a hallmark of his career.
1996 Harold See's campaign for Associate Justice, Alabama Supreme Court
A former campaign worker charged that, at Rove's behest, he distributed flyers that anonymously attacked Harold See, their own client. This put the opponent's campaign in an awkward position; public denials of responsibility for the scurrilous flyers would be implausible. Rove's client was elected.
1998 George W. Bush gubernatorial campaign
Rove was an adviser for Bush's 1998 reelection campaign. From July through December 1998, Bush's reelection committee paid Rove & Co. nearly $2.5 million, and also paid the Rove-owned Praxis List Company $267,000 for use of mailing lists. Rove says his work for the Bush campaign included direct mail, voter contact, phone banks, computer services, and travel expenses. Of the $2.5 million, Rove said, ""bout 30 percent of that is postage"". In all, Bush (primarily through Rove's efforts) raised $17.7 million, with $3.4 million unspent as of March 1999. During the course of this campaign Rove's much-reported feud with Rick Perry began, with Perry's strategists believing Rove gave Perry bad advice in order to help Bush get a larger share of the Hispanic vote.
2000 Harold See campaign for Chief Justice
For the race to succeed Perry Hooper, who was retiring as Alabama's chief justice, Rove lined up support for See from a majority of the state's important Republicans.
2000 George W. Bush presidential campaign and the sale of Karl Rove & Co..
In early 1999, Rove sold his 20-year-old direct-mail business, Karl Rove & Co., which provided campaign services to candidates, along with Praxis List Company (in whole or part) to Ted Delisi and Todd Olsen, two young political operatives who had worked on campaigns of some other Rove candidates. Rove helped finance the sale of the company, which had 11 employees. Selling Karl Rove & Co. was a condition that George W. Bush had insisted on before Rove took the job of chief strategist for Bush's presidential bid.
George W. Bush Administration.
When George W. Bush was first inaugurated in January 2001, Rove accepted an appointment as Senior Advisor. He was later given the title Deputy Chief of Staff to the President after the successful 2004 Presidential election. In a November 2004 speech, Bush publicly thanked Rove, calling him "the architect" of his victory over John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election.
In April 2006, Rove was reassigned from his policy development role to one focusing on strategic and tactical planning in anticipation of the November 2006 congressional elections.
Congressional subpoenas.
On May 2, 2007, the Senate Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena to Attorney General Gonzales compelling the Department of Justice to produce all email from Rove regarding the Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy no matter what email account Rove may have used, with a deadline of May 15, 2007, for compliance. The subpoena also demanded relevant email previously produced in the Valarie Plame controversy and investigation for the CIA leak scandal (2003).
On August 31, 2007, Karl Rove resigned without responding to the Senate Judiciary Committee subpoena claiming, "I just think it's time to leave." President Bush bid a fond farewell to his good friend and promised to follow him soon.
On May 22, 2008, Rove was subpoenaed by House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers to testify on the politicization of the Department of Justice. However, on July 10, Rove refused to acknowledge his congressional subpoena citing executive privilege as his reason.
On February 23, 2009, Rove was required by Congressional subpoena to testify before the House Judiciary Committee concerning his knowledge of the Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy and the alleged political prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman, but did not appear on this date. He and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers later agreed to testify under oath before Congress about these matters.
On July 7 and July 30, 2009, Rove testified before the House Judiciary Committee regarding questions about the dismissal of seven U.S. Attorneys under the Bush Administration. Rove was also questioned regarding the federal prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman, who was convicted of fraud. The Committee concluded that Rove had played a significant role in the attorney firings.
Activities since leaving the White House.
Shortly after leaving the White House, Rove was hired to write about the 2008 Presidential Election for "Newsweek". He was also later hired as a contributor for the "Wall Street Journal" and a political analyst for Fox News. Rove was an informal advisor to 2008 Republican Presidential candidate John McCain, and donated $2,300 to his campaign. His memoir, "Courage and Consequence", was published in March 2010. One advance reviewer, Dana Milbank of "The Washington Post", said of the book that Rove "revives claims discredited long ago". The controversial book has inspired a grassroots rock and roll compilation of a similar name Courage and Consequence that was released a week before the memoir.
Rove has also spent significant time on the road giving speeches to schools and other groups. Rove was scheduled to give the commencement address at Choate Rosemary Hall, a New England boarding school, but canceled after protests from students and faculty. He instead made a private appearance at the school on February 11, 2008.
On March 9, 2008, Rove appeared at the University of Iowa as a paid speaker to a crowd of approximately 1,000. He was met with hostility and two students were removed by police after attempting a citizen's arrest for alleged crimes committed during his time with the Bush administration. Near the end of the speech, a member of the audience asked, "Can we have our $40,000 back?" Rove replied, "No, you can't."
On June 24, 2008, Rove said of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama, "Even if you never met him, you know this guy. He's the guy at the country club with the beautiful date, holding a martini and a cigarette that stands against the wall and makes snide comments about everyone."
Rove agreed to debate one-time presidential candidate and former Senator John Edwards on September 26, 2008, at the University at Buffalo. However, Edwards dropped out and was replaced with General Wesley Clark.
Rove, who was hired by Fox News to provide analysis for the network's election coverage, defended his role on the news team to the Television Critics Association.
On November 3, 2008, Rove spoke on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis on the eve of Election Day.
In 2010, Rove became an advisor to American Crossroads, a Republican 527 organization raising money for the 2012 election effort.
Rove made appearances at a number of campuses, including UC Merced on October 8 as conservatives students, in the College Republicans at UC Merced, sought to provide an alternative perspective since First Lady Michelle Obama and Former President Jimmy Carter spoke at the young campus.
Rove was the guest host of "The Rush Limbaugh Show" on Monday, August 9, 2010., marking his first time hosting a radio talk show.
In a profile which appeared in the December 15, 2011 issue of "The New Republic", Rove, with his hands-on involvement with American Crossroads, is described as one of the shrewdest navigators of the political climate after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision which exempted political broadcasts funded by corporations and unions from campaign finance limits. "Rove had no role in creating this new legal environment... but if Rove and his allies did not invent it, they certainly were adroit at exploiting it."
Following Todd Akin's comments regarding "legitimate rape" and the notion that raped women are unlikely to become pregnant, Rove joked about murdering the Missouri Senate candidate, saying "We should sink Todd Akin. If he’s found mysteriously murdered, don’t look for my whereabouts!" After multiple news outlets picked up on the story, Rove apologized for the remark. Rove's Crossroads GPS organization had previously pulled its television advertising from Missouri in the wake of the comments.
On November 7, 2012, Rove protested Fox News' call of the 2012 presidential election for Barack Obama, prompting host Megyn Kelly to ask him, "Is this just math that you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better? Or is this real?"<ref>

On the cars of the Cuban Army there is a "FAR" ("Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias") inscription in the central lower part of the licence plate. In the case of the Ministry of Interior, there is a "MININT" ("Ministerio del Interior") inscription. Licence plates of the Army are always of light green colour, while plates of the Ministry of Interior are dark green.
Diplomatic cars use 6 digits without preceding letters. There is a "D", "C" or "E" letter in the lower left part of the licence plate (D = diplomatic, C - consular, E - other status). They have a black colour licence plate.
Cars for hire have a licence plate beginning with "T" letter (meaning "turista"), followed by five digits. They are of dark red colour.
Provisional licence plates have the normal code of the province followed by 4 digits and a "P" letter, the colour of the plate is light red.

Publius Volumnius

Publius Volumnius was a 1st-century BC Roman philosopher, and a friend and companion of Marcus Junius Brutus who led the conspiracy to assassinate Julius Caesar. Volumnius and Brutus had been students of philosophy together.
Volumnius accompanied Brutus on his fateful campaign to the East, which culminated in Brutus' suicide after his defeat by the Triumvirs in the Second Battle of Philippi (October 23, 42 BC).
The historian Plutarch, in his "Life of Brutus", uses Volumnius' recollections as a source for an account of the prodigies which supposedly preceded the death of Brutus. Volumnius' writings were also drawn upon by Plutarch for first-hand information on the last hours of Brutus in the aftermath of the battle. Volumnius was asked by Brutus to assist him in his suicide but Volumnius refused the request.
The well-known quote by Brutus calling down a curse upon Mark Antony was also taken from the memoirs of Volumnius:
"Forget not, Zeus, the author of these crimes" (in the Dryden translation this passage is given as "Punish, great Jove, the author of these ills").
Plutarch wrote that, according to Volumnius, Brutus repeated two verses, but Volumnius was only able to recall the one quoted.
Volumnius appears as a character in Shakespeare's play "Julius Caesar".

Joseph Mills

Joseph Nathan Mills (born 30 October 1989) is an English footballer who plays for Shrewsbury Town on loan from Burnley. He is the younger brother of Bolton Wanderers defender Matthew Mills and can play at either left back or left midfield.
Career.
Southampton.
He made his Southampton first team debut as substitute in a League Cup match against Birmingham City on 26 August 2008. He made his league debut at home against Barnsley on 20 September 2008.
On 23 February 2009, he joined Scunthorpe United on an emergency loan for one month. On 24 March, the loan was extended to the end of the 2008–09 season.

He made his Burnley debut in the League Cup first round win over Port Vale and then made his first league appearance the following weekend in the 2–0 win against Bolton Wanderers. He went on to make 10 league appearances during the 2012–13 season, before joining Burnley permanently in the summer of 2013, signing a two-year contract. 
On 16 August 2013, he joined League One side Oldham Athletic on a one-month loan deal.
On 31 January 2014, Mills joined Shrewsbury Town on loan for the remainder of the 2013–14 season.

Demos Magyarország

Demos Magyarország or Demos Hungary is an independent foundation established by private individuals. As a think- tank – following the model of similar Anglo-Saxon institutions – it undertakes research projects based on proposals submitted by outside parties, and also on its own initiative. Its aim is to do background research for political decision-makers, and to form Hungarian common talk about our society with thought-provoking approaches.
Mission.
The goal of the DEMOS Hungary Foundation is to act as a bridge between academia and political decision-makers, developing new policy solutions that meet the social, economic and political requirements of our age. DEMOS is committed to revitalising public thinking and policy decision-making through its exploration of new issues, fresh ideas and policy recommendations which also lend themselves to practical implementation. Thereby it helps to create structures and institutions that are capable of responding to the challenges posed by a continuously changing world.
The results of DEMOS research projects are generally available to the public. In addition to conducting research and analyses, the Foundation also organises conferences in order to promote such subject areas to the public.
Activities.
In order to achieve the objectives outlined above, DEMOS Hungary’s activities can be grouped into the following core areas:
Traditionally, Hungarians expect the improvement of their life from the politicians and the state rather than from themselves. Nowadays, we need to redefine not only the fundamental pillars of our identity, but also our expectations with regard to the State. Developing a system of responsibilities and clearly defining the relationship – the limits of rights and duties – between the State, the individual and the business sphere has been one of the most important tasks during the decades following the transition from the previous political system.
Citizens in Hungary and the other former socialist states have experienced a dual transition: not only was an information society introduced into their countries, but the political and economic systems they were accustomed to changed at the same time. To determine what might make Hungary competitive and successful in the 21st century, we need to assess our country’s current state realistically, and evaluate its strengths and weaknesses in the light of global competition.
If Hungary is to be modernised, not only the long established cultural attitudes and the way citizens think have to change and transform, but the State itself has to be overhauled. A more efficient and fairer institutional system that provides higher quality services is a justifiable expectation for all Hungarian citizens. In defining the scope of its research, DEMOS Hungary focuses on those areas where the constant delay in identifying solutions to key problems is no longer tenable.
DEMOS Hungary closely follows key developments in public policy and social science research. To ensure that modern left-wing ideas become known in Hungary, it makes major inspirational studies available in Hungarian in its journal entitled Progresszív Politika (Progressive Politics), and publishes books by major influential progressive Hungarian and foreign writers. Furthermore, it seeks to aid co-operation and intellectual exchange between Hungarian and international policy-makers by inviting renowned international experts and politicians and organising conferences.

Music of the Future

"Music of the Future" (German: "Zukunftsmusik") is the title of an essay by Richard Wagner, first published in French translation in 1860 as "La musique de l'avenir" and published in the original German in 1861. It was intended to introduce the librettos of Wagner's operas to a French audience at the time when he was hoping to launch in Paris a production of "Tannhäuser", and sets out a number of his desiderata for true opera, including the need for 'endless melody'. Wagner deliberately put the title in inverted commas to distance himself from the term; "Zukunftsmusik" had already been adopted, both by Wagner's enemies, in the 1850s, often as a deliberate misunderstanding of the ideas set out in Wagner's 1849 essay, "The Artwork of the Future", and by his supporters, notably Franz Liszt. Wagner's essay seeks to explain why the term is inadequate, or inappropriate, for his approach.
Background.
Early use of the term, and its anti-Wagnerian overtones.
The earliest use of the term "Zukunftsmusik" seems to date from 1854, when a Viennese critic, L. A. Zellner, used it in respect of the music of both Wagner and Robert Schumann; it was also used that year by the composer Louis Spohr. It began to be used in a specifically pejorative sense against Wagner by the editor Ludwig Bischoff, an associate of the conservative Ferdinand Hiller. The term "Musique de l'avenir" was also used in France as an anti-Wagnerian slogan. This is demonstrated by some French caricatures of 1860 and 1861. They appeared in connection with Wagner's concerts on January 25, February 1 and February 8, 1860, at the Parisian "Théâtre Italien" and performances of his "Tannhäuser" in March 1861 in Paris, which ended in a debacle. In one of these caricatures an orchestra in front of a stage can be seen. The singers on the stage are two crying babies. The caption explains that the conductor Alphonse Royer had recruited "artistes de l'avenir" ("artists of the future") at an orphanage for a performance of "Tannhäuser". In another caricature a conductor asks one of his musicians, to play his part, to which the musician replies (as it is "musique de l'avenir"), he will play it next week. "Musique de l'avenir" thus carried a meaning of musical nonsense.
Interpretation of the term by the Weimar school.
By Wagner's supporters the word "Zukunftsmusik" was used in a larger, and more positive, scope. Typically, this term was used in connection with the aesthetic aims of the circle of artists around Franz Liszt in Weimar, among them Joachim Raff, Hans von Bülow, Peter Cornelius, Rudolph Viole, Felix Draeseke, Alexander Ritter and others. They regarded themselves as "Zukunftsmusiker" ("musicians of the future") with meaning of progressive artists. Since they were well known as propagandists in favour of Wagner's works, Wagner's style was considered as part of "Zukunftsmusik".
Much to Wagner's anger, however, Liszt did not concentrate solely on Wagner's works at Weimar. He also performed works by other contemporary composers, among them Robert Schumann, Ferdinand Hiller, Hector Berlioz, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Anton Rubinstein, Eduard Sobolewski and Giuseppe Verdi. The activities of the circle around Liszt were termed in France as "École anarchique" ("Anarchic School") or "École de Weimar" ("Weimarian School"). Occasionally, Schumann was regarded as a representative of that school, and there are even examples where Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy was called its originator.
Schumann himself would not have liked to be taken as representative of Wagner's or Liszt's kind of "Zukunftsmusik". In a letter to Joseph Joachim of October 7, 1853, he referred to Liszt as "Judas Iscariot, who might quite well keep preaching at the Ilm"; and in a letter of February 6, 1854, to Richard Pohl, he wrote:
Pohl was a member of Liszt's intimate circle at Weimar. Liszt therefore might have heard of Schumann's opinion, but despite this he shortly afterwards published his "Piano Sonata in B Minor" with a dedication to Schumann.
Divergences between Wagner and Liszt.
Liszt admired Wagner as composer of genius, but he did not share Wagner's ideas on the "Music of the Future". Liszt's leading idea was to unite poetry and music in works of instrumental music, in Symphonic Poems and other symphonic works with a "program", subjects of non-musical nature; quite the opposite of Wagner's ideal to unite all the arts in staged music drama. In some of Liszt's essays, for example in that about Berlioz and "Harold in Italy", he opposed some of Wagner's views. Wagner meanwhile had given luke-warm support to Liszt's ideas in his 1857 essay "On Franz Liszt's Symphonic Poems, ".
In the beginning of 1859 came a showdown between Liszt and Wagner, whose increasing success led him to feel more independent from his former mentor. Liszt had received in December 1858 the first act of Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde" with a dedication to him himself. In a letter to Wagner he announced that he would send scores of his "Dante Symphony", dedicated to Wagner, and his "Grand Mass". He received a letter from Wagner, written from Venice on December 31, 1858, stating that the Weimarians with their idealistic talk about art should leave him alone. They should send money instead, since this was all he needed and wanted to get from them. As answer, Liszt, in a letter of January 4, 1859, wrote, he would return the "Tristan" act. Besides, since the "Dante Symphony" and the "Grand Mass" could not be taken as stocks and bonds, it was superfluous to send such worthless scrip to Venice.
From this point onwards, Liszt sought to establish his musical ideals through the Allgemeine Deutsche Musikverein (General German Music Union) (q.v.), which he founded with the editor and critic Franz Brendel.
Origins of Wagner's essay.
Open letter to Berlioz.
The origins of the essay may be traced to an open letter which Wagner wrote to Berlioz in February 1860, in response to a printed article by Berlioz. Berlioz had poked fun at 'la musique de l'avenir'. In his letter Wagner disclaimed the use of this formulaic term, attributing it to his enemies Hiller and Bischoff, and asserted the principles he had set out in his essay "The Artwork of the Future". He also took the opportunity in his letter to flatter Berlioz and to look forward to the premiere of his opera "Les Troyens."
The essay ""Zukunftsmusik"".
Wagner's essay ""Zukunftsmusik"" is dated September 1860 and is in the form of a letter to a French admirer, M. Villot. It was intended as a preface to a book of French translations of some of Wagner's libretti, including "Tannhäuser" and "Tristan und Isolde." Wagner's intention was doubtless to familiarise the Parisian public with his ideas on music and opera in advance of performances there which he hoped would secure his fame and fortune; 'a lucid exposition of my thoughts would dispel such prejudice and error'.
Contents of Wagner's essay.
In the essay, Wagner recapitulates the ideas he had developed ten years previously in the essays Art and Revolution, The Artwork of the Future and Opera and Drama, placing them in the context of his own autobiographical experiences. He advances his opera libretti as practical examples of his theories. He condemns the artificiality of Italian opera, with its recitatives and repeated arias that break up dramatic flow; he continues his attack on Grand Opera; he denounces German opera as without any style of its own, with a few exceptions (notably Carl Maria von Weber. He takes Beethoven's symphonies as the furthest possible development of instrumental music.
Only Wagner's own vision of music drama, a fusion of poetry and music, can lead to a true development of art. 'Not a Programme can speak the meaning of the Symphony; no, nothing but a stage-performance of the Dramatic Action itself'. Obsession with florid operatic melody is trivial: 'The poet's greatness is mostly to be measured by what he leaves unsaid, letting us breathe in silence tonourselves the thing unspeakable; the musician it is who brings this untold mystery to clarion tongue, and the impeccable form of his sounding silence is "endless melody" '.
Wagner concedes that 'even in the feebler works of frivolous composers his former mentor Meyerbeer , I have met with isolated effects that made me marvel at the incomparable might of Music.' But only Wagner's determination to ensure concentration of dramatic action and the subvention of music to this aim will produce dramatic art worthy of the name. 'In these [...] points you might find the most valid definition of my "innovations", but by no means in an absolute-musical caprice such as people have thought fit to foist upon me under the name of the "Music of the Future".'

Hans Gustaf Westman (9 March 1905 – 17 November 1991) was a Swedish architect mainly active in Scania, Sweden's most Southern province. He performed approximately 120 works in the city of Lund inspired by works of Le Corbusier.
Hans Westman practised as an architect in Skåne from 1932 until 1983. His works united regional cultural tradition with functionalism, attempting to create a new, "Westmannian" regional architecture instead of recreating old models. At the same time, Westman resented functionalists' neglect of the human factor that manifested itself in large scale buildings with routinely applied monotonous patterns. Westman's critique became a driving motive for a humanistic development in architecture of Lund.

Dave Barnett (footballer)

David Kwame "Dave" Barnett (born 16 April 1967) is an English former football player and coach who played as a defender in the Football League for Colchester United, Walsall, Barnet, Birmingham City, Port Vale and Lincoln City. He also represented Dunfermline Athletic in the Scottish Premier League and Edmonton Brickmen in the Canadian Soccer League. He made more than 200 appearances for nearly 20 clubs during his career. He is currently first-team coach at Romulus.
Playing career.
Born in Birmingham, Barnett began his youth career at Wolverhampton Wanderers, but was released without making an appearance. He then joined non-league side Alvechurch before being picked up by Windsor & Eton. From here, he was signed by Colchester United manager Roger Brown in the summer of 1988. His professional career started with a bang as he was sent off on his debut in the opening day fixture of the 1988–89 season, becoming only the second U's player after Nigel Crouch to be dismissed on their maiden appearance for the club. After serving his suspension, Barnett was again sent off in only his seventh league game during a 2–1 home defeat to Scunthorpe United on 8 October 1988.
His lack of discipline earned him the nickname "Psycho" with the Colchester fans for his ability to get into trouble at every opportunity as his time at the club came to an abrupt end when the latest manager Jock Wallace watched him commit an off-the-ball indiscretion during a reserve game. After his Colchester exit, Barnett moved to Canada to play for Canadian Soccer League club Edmonton Brickmen where he played alongside Justin Fashanu. Barnett returned to England in October 1989 to sign for West Bromwich Albion on a non-contract basis, though he failed to make a first-team appearance for the Baggies. He then moved to Walsall for the early part of the 1990–91 season before returning to non-league football with Kidderminster Harriers. Here, he made 39 Conference appearances and helped the club to Wembley for the 1991 FA Trophy final, in which they finished runners-up to Wycombe Wanderers.
Barnett was signed by Barry Fry at Barnet for a £17,000 fee in February 1992 and aided the club to promotion from the Third Division in 1992–93. As the Bee's struggled in the higher tier, Barnett was loaned to his hometown club Birmingham City in December 1993 where he played twice, before returning to Barnet who were subsequently relegated. While at Underhill, Barnett made 59 league appearances and scored three goals.
Birmingham City eventually signed Barnett on a permanent basis in February 1994, once again teaming up with Barry Fry who had been appointed manager at St Andrew's. Signing for £150,000, the club were relegated to the Second Division in 1994 but Barnett helped the club gain immediate promotion back to the First Division as a virtual ever-present feature of the first-team. He also made another Wembley appearance, this time in the 1995 Football League Trophy Final, which City won 1–0 over Carlisle United with a golden goal from Paul Tait. However, he did not feature in the 1995–96 season and played just six games in 1996–97 under new manager Trevor Francis, and so left for Dunfermline Athletic in July 1997.
Barnett featured 21 times for Dunfermline in the Scottish Premier Division during the 1997–98 season, scoring once to help Bert Paton's side retain their top-flight status. However, before the season was up, Barnett made a deadline day loan move to Port Vale, where he made nine appearances and scored one goal. During the close season, the move back to England was made permanent as he made 27 further appearances for Vale. His final professional transfer came following a successful trial spell at Lincoln City in the summer of 1999, where he made 22 league appearances and netted three times. While with Lincoln, Barnett had a three-game loan spell in the Conference with Forest Green Rovers. Notified by Lincoln that he would be given a free transfer at the end of the 1999–2000 season, Barnett ended up with an injury prior to his release and in turn announced his retirement.
International career.
In 2000, Barnett was due to play international football for the Cayman Islands, but a Football Association veto blocked the efforts of nations such as the Cayman Islands acquiring English players.
Coaching career.
After finishing his professional playing career, Barnett joined the Birmingham City Academy as a part-time coach, before joining Halesowen Town as first-team coach in March 2001. He then took up his Academy role at Birmingham in a full-time capacity. Barnett would later turn out for Moor Green, where he made five appearances in 2002.
Following his return from the United States in the summer of 2009, Barnett signed for Romulus in August and was subsequently appointed first-team coach at the club in February 2010 after initially refusing to be involved in coaching at the club having obtained a UEFA 'A' Licence. He agreed to continue his role at the club for the 2010–11 season, however, his disciplinary issues continued after being given a six-match suspension and a £100 fine by the FA following four breaches of FA Rule E3 - language and/or behaviour amounting to improper conduct - following a match with Belper Town in November 2012.

Lachmann's law

Lachmann's law is a somewhat disputed phonological sound law for Latin named after German Indo-Europeanist Karl Lachmann who first formulated it sometime in the middle of the 19th century. According to it, vowels in Latin lengthen before Proto-Indo-European voiced stops which are followed by another (unvoiced) stop.
Compare:
According to Lachmann's law is an example of sound law that affects "deep" phonological structure, not the surface result of phonological rules. In Proto-Indo-European, a voiced stop was already "pronounced" as voiceless before voiceless stops, as the assimilation by voicedness must have been operational in PIE ( → 'forced, made'). Lachmann's law, however, did not act upon the result of the assimilation, but on the deep structure > *agtos > āctus. Indo-Europeanists reject this explanation, generally believing that the voiced finals were analogically restored in the appropriate forms before being deleted again. 
For example, defends the Neogrammarian analysis of Lachmann's law as analogy followed by sound change (*aktos ⇒ *agtos > *āgtos > āctus). Although this formulation ultimately derives from de Sausurre (1885: 256), Jasanoff's formulation also explains problems such as:
The law also does not operate before PIE voiced aspirate stops. Based on this, the glottalic theory reinterprets the law not to reflect lengthening before voiced stops, but before glottalized stops. In that case the assumption that we are dealing with an example of sound law that affects deep phonological structure is not required.

Wikitravel

Wikitravel is a web-based collaborative travel guide project, based upon the wiki model, launched by Evan Prodromou and Michele Ann Jenkins in 2003. In 2006, Internet Brands bought the trademark and servers and later introduced advertising to the website. This move met opposition from users, with many German and Italian editors leaving for a newly established wiki, Wikivoyage.
Wikitravel received a Webby Award for Best Travel Website in 2007. That same year, Wikitravel's founders began Wikitravel Press, a now-defunct project which published printed travel guides based on the Web site's content. The first print guides were released on February 1, 2008.
In 2012, a large portion of the editing community, including the founders, left and brought their contributions to the Wikivoyage project, which was relaunched as a Wikimedia Foundation-hosted project in January 2013.
Description.
Using a wiki model, Wikitravel is built through collaboration of "Wikitravellers" from around the globe. Articles can cover any level of geographic specificity, from continents to districts of a city. These are logically connected in a hierarchy, by specifying that the location covered in one article "is in" the larger location described by another. The project also includes articles on travel-related topics, phrasebooks for travelers, and suggested itineraries.
Wikitravel is a multilingual project available in 21 languages, with each language-specific project developed independently. The English-language version leads in terms of number of articles with over 24,500 in April 2011. While the project uses the MediaWiki software, Wikitravel is not a Wikimedia project (and is in direct competition with Wikimedia's Wikivoyage project). It was begun and is operated independently.
Wikitravel travel guides are available under a free content license; while Internet Brands owns the web site and associated trademarks, contributors own the content they contribute and they agree to license that content for free use.
Content.
Wikitravel content is broadly categorised as Destinations, Itineraries, Phrasebooks, and Travel topics.
Destinations.
Geographical units within the geographical hierarchy may be described in articles, based on the criterion, "can you sleep there?"
The hierarchy includes:
Attractions such as hotels, restaurants, bars, stores, nightclubs, tour operators, museums, statues or other works of art, city parks, town squares or streets, festivals or events, transport systems or stations, bodies of water and uninhabited islands are listed in the article for the place they're located.
Itineraries.
An itinerary describes a group of destinations according to a temporal division rather than a spatial one and will list destinations and attractions to visit during a given amount of time, with recommended durations of stay and routes to follow.
Itineraries may cross geographical regions, but will usually have a well-defined path.
Phrasebooks.
A phrasebook will comprise:
Travel topics.
Travel topics are articles that deal with a specific topic of interest to travelers that is too large or detailed to go in a specific travel guide destination page, travel tips that are so general that they apply to nearly all destinations and do not need to be in each specific travel guide, major events that occur in different places, and specialist travel information such as regional guides to Scuba diving sites.
History.
Wikitravel was started in July 2003 by Evan Prodromou and Michele Ann Jenkins, partly inspired by Wikipedia. To allow individuals, tourism agencies, and so on to make free reprints of individual pages more easily than permitted by the GNU Free Documentation License (used by Wikipedia at that time) it used the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license. Since both Wikipedia and Wikitravel are now licensed under the Attribution ShareAlike license, appropriate content can be shared between the two so long as licensing requirements are met.
Wikitravel does not have a neutral-point-of-view requirement, as it is written from the point of view of a traveler and, instead, encourages editors to "be fair".
Wikitravel encourages original research in its content, and therefore does not generally require citation, but it does require contributions to comply with its Manual of Style, to provide an easily recognised and consistent layout and appearance, and to avoid touting.
On April 20, 2006, Wikitravel announced that it and World66—another open-content wiki travel guide founded in 1999—had been acquired by Internet Brands, a publicly traded corporation. The new owner hired Prodromou and Jenkins to continue managing Wikitravel as a consensus-based project. They explained that Internet Brands' long-term plan was for Wikitravel to continue to focus on collaborative, objective guides, while World66 would focus more on personal experiences and reviews. In response, many authors of the German language community chose to fork the German Wikitravel, which was released on December 10, 2006, as Wikivoyage. The German language Wikitravel remains active. On April 1, 2008, Internet Brands added Google advertising to Wikitravel, with an opt-out procedure for registered users.
On May 1, 2007, Wikitravel received the Webby Award for Best Travel Website. On June 16, 2008, Wikitravel was named one of the "50 Best Websites of 2008" by "Time" magazine.
On August 3, 2007, Prodromou, Jenkins, and long-time contributor Jani Patokallio started Wikitravel Press, a company that produces and sells print guidebooks based on material contributed to Wikitravel. The first Wikitravel Press guides, "Chicago" and "Singapore", were officially launched on February 1, 2008. Content in these guidebooks was available under the same Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license under which Wikitravel material is licensed. The Wikitravel trademarks were licensed to Wikitravel Press, but there was otherwise no connection to Internet Brands. Wikitravel Press ceased to operate in 2011.
On January 1, 2010, the content of Wikitravel was migrated to the updated Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0 license.
In mid-2012, a proposal was floated by members of the editing community to fork their work at Wikitravel (forking in this context means to move editing activities and current content to a new host, in accordance with the site license) and re-merge with the travel website Wikivoyage—itself a fork of German and Italian language Wikitravel some years previously—and to then seek hosting of the merged sites by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation (see "Community fork, 2012" below). Internet Brands opposed this move and sued one Wikitravel contributor and one Wikipedia contributor, alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition and civil conspiracy, a move opposed by both individuals and the Wikimedia Foundation as being an example of a SLAPP lawsuit—one undertaken without plausible legal grounds with a primary intent being to deter, overwhelm, or frustrate persons engaged in fully lawful actions.
Community fork in 2012.
In 2012, after a lengthy history of dissatisfaction with Wikitravel's host and owner Internet Brands, it was proposed that the community at Wikitravel fork (split off) their work and editing activities from "Wikitravel" and "Wikitravel Shared" and—together with the existing sites at Wikivoyage—merge to create a new travel wiki to be hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, the owner of Wikipedia and a large range of other non-profit reference sites based upon wiki communities. The dissatisfaction related to long standing discontent at poor hosting, poor site updates, and excessive over-monetarization and advertising, and eventually, interference by Internet Brands in the community's activities in breach of prior agreements and understandings.
After lengthy discussion by users of all three communities and comments by their respective hosts, and confirmation by the Wikimedia Foundation that it would host a travel project if users wished, the majority of administrators and bureaucrats at Wikitravel decided to fork their existing work to Wikivoyage.
The contents of Wikitravel and its related 'Commons' (images, video and other media files) in all languages and of Wikitravel Commons were downloaded as a 'database dump' in preparation for such a migration on August 2, 2012 and as the starting point for the existing wiki. Forking is a normal or anticipated activity in wiki communities and is permitted by the Creative Commons license in use on sites such as Wikitravel; the wiki software used for Wikitravel included that facility, although Internet Brands disabled the function shortly after this date to forestall the attempt at data migration or forking. The community discussion at Wikimedia ended 23 August 2012 with 540 votes in support and 152 votes in opposition of the creation of a Wikimedia Foundation travel guide project. The wiki text was moved to Wikimedia Foundation servers on November 10, 2012.
A significant part of the editing community including most of the administrators at the time, and the existing Wikitravel content for most languages resumed under the 'Wikivoyage' name as www.wikivoyage.org, as an ad-free and not-for-profit reference site in early 2013.
On August 24, 2012, Internet Brands filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court against Wikitravel administrator Ryan Holliday and Wikipedia administrator James Heilman involving claims of trademark infringement and unfair business practices. In September 2012, the Wikimedia Foundation filed a complaint in San Francisco County Superior Court on behalf of Holliday and Heilman asking the court to declare that "forking has and remains a legal activity." In February 2013 the parties settled their litigation. The terms of the settlement were not reported.

Ernest Llewellyn

Ernest Victor Llewellyn CBE (21 June 191512 July 1982) was an Australian violinist, concertmaster, violist, conductor and musical administrator. He was the founding director of the Canberra School of Music and he is commemorated in the concert venue there, Llewellyn Hall.
Early career.
Ernest Llewellyn was born in Kurri Kurri, New South Wales in 1915. He was educated at Kurri Kurri State School, Maitland High School, and, for six months, at the NSW Conservatorium of Music in Sydney. In 1933 the 17-year old Llewellyn gave a ‘grand farewell violin recital’ at the West Maitland Town Hall. It was later decided that the money raised by the concert and by public appeal should be given to those suffering in the Great Depression. In 1934 he commenced studies with Jascha Gopinko.
From 1934 to 1937 he was the violist in the Sydney String Quartet and the leader of the viola section of the ABC Sydney Orchestra. In 1936 he appeared as a solo violinist under the baton of Sir Malcolm Sargent. He was offered the position of deputy leader of the Scottish Orchestra, but turned it down.
That year he married Ruth Smith, daughter of the violin and viola maker A.E. Smith, whose wedding gift was a violin of his own making. In 1940 he moved to Melbourne to become Deputy Leader of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. He also taught at the University of Melbourne, and was the leader of the Melbourne University String Quartet. He served his country between 1942 and 1944 in the Royal Australian Air Force.
From 1944 to 1948 he was leader of the Queensland State String Quartet (QSSQ), taking them on a tour of New Zealand in 1948 at the invitation of the Wellington Chamber Music Society. Reviews of the tour led to the establishment of the New Zealand Federation of Chamber Music Clubs. In 1947, Isaac Stern visited Australia for the first time. He attended a performance by the QSSQ, was struck by the tonal qualities of the violin being played by Llewellyn, so he went backstage and met him, and learned about A.E. Smith for the first time. The next morning they swapped instruments and played together; the two became lifelong friends.
In 1949 Ernest Llewellyn and Hephzibah Menuhin (then married to an Australian and living in western Victoria) presented the complete violin sonatas of Beethoven in a series of recitals in the eastern states of Australia.
Sydney Symphony Orchestra.
Llewellyn was appointed Concertmaster of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in 1949, and Assistant Conductor in 1959. From 1949 to 1955 he was the leader of the ABC String Quartet. In 1952 he again toured New Zealand, this time as part of the Llewellyn-Kennedy Piano Trio (with John Kennedy, cello, and Scylla Kennedy, piano; they were the parents of Nigel Kennedy, although they never married).
When Isaac Stern toured Australia again in 1954, he and Llewellyn played Bach's Double Concerto with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. The pianist William Kapell had recently been killed in a plane crash while returning from his Australian tour, and Stern set up the William Kapell Memorial Fund to bring notable musicians to the US for wider experience. Stern gave a concert in Sydney in July 1954 for the William Kapell Memorial Fund, and ensured that Ernest Llewellyn was the inaugural recipient. At the same time he was awarded a Fulbright grant to study teaching methods in the US, the UK and Europe for 15 months. He spent most of his time studying with Isaac Stern at the Juilliard School in New York.
In the 1950s Ernest Llewellyn inaugurated and directed music camps and festivals for the National Music Camp Association and for Musica Viva Australia at Mittagong. He also directed workshops through Musica Viva and the Musica Viva Younger Group.
Canberra School of Music.
He resigned from the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in 1964 to devote his time to full-time teaching. He intended to teach privately in Wollongong, Goulburn, Mittagong and Canberra, and to establish regional orchestras. A year later, in September 1965, at the invitation of the Department of the Interior, he became founding director of the Canberra School of Music, immediately appointing some of the finest performers in the country to the staff, including Larry Sitsky (keyboard), Vincent Edwards (strings) and Murray Khouri (woodwind). During his time as Director he continued to perform, taking part in many of the School's faculty concerts, leading the Canberra String Quartet, and in 1966 becoming musical director and conductor of the Canberra Symphony Orchestra, a semi-professional full symphony orchestra that was formed out of the amateur Canberra Orchestral Society by joining its forces with staff and students from the School of Music. Between 1969 and 1979, the Canberra Symphony's annual program under Llewellyn featured masterworks of the choral repertoire (including Orff's "Carmina Burana", Elgar's "The Dream of Gerontius", Beethoven's "Choral" Symphony and the Verdi "Requiem") performed with a combined choir known as the Singers of Canberra, made up of the leading choral organisations in the city: the Canberra Choral Society, ANU Choral Society, Canberra Philharmonic and Canberra Society of Singers.
The Canberra School of Music operated until 1976 in temporary premises that were previously the Manuka Mothercraft Centre. In 1976 he was given approval to proceed with his plans for a permanent School of Music in Canberra. He based his conception of the School as a centre of excellence on the Juillard School, and he regarded Isaac Stern as the "father" of the school. He envisioned one that would not only be a centre of creativity and performance but also be the home of a world-class concert venue. Stern inspected the school in its early stages while on his last concert tour of Australia in the early 1970s. Llewellyn had insisted from the outset that the building should be located on a site that was both central to the Australian National University and the city centre, easily accessible for both students and patrons. Together with the Melbourne architect Daryl Jackson, Llewellyn produced a final plan that was architecturally innovative and original, and which ensured that the building would continue to be recognised historically as a unique piece of architecture. The concert hall has indeed become world-class, and was named Llewellyn Hall in 1980 on his retirement as Director of the School of Music.
Llewellyn was invited to attend the fifth International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow as an ‘honoured guest’ in 1974, and in 1978 he became the first Australian to serve on a jury in the Tchaikovsky competition. In 1979 and 1980 he visited China to advise on teaching methods. The 1979 visit was at the invitation of the String Department of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music to advise on teaching methods and give master classes in Beijing and Shanghai. The second visit was arranged under the Cultural Relations program.
Retirement.
He retired as Director of the Canberra School of Music and as conductor of the Canberra Symphony Orchestra in 1980. In 1981-82 he established the Wollongong Branch of the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. Plans were in hand for a third visit to China and an exchange visit to Ottawa to conduct the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra and to advise on the establishment of a Conservatorium there, but he died on 12 July 1982, in Sydney. He was survived by his wife Ruth Llewellyn and his sons Daffyd and Richard.
Later that month the retiring Governor-General Sir Zelman Cowen announced that the proceeds of his farewell concert would be devoted to the Ernest Llewellyn Memorial Scholarship, to help young musicians and the advancement of string playing in Australia. In 1985, Isaac Stern made a special trip to Australia to give a benefit concert at the Sydney Opera House in tribute to Llewellyn, with the proceeds (nearly $80,000) going to the Llewellyn Scholarship. This put the scholarship on a firm financial footing, and the first awards were made in 1987.
Llewellyn was a member of the Board of Governors of the Frensham School in Mittagong. He was involved with the ABC for much of his working life, leading the ABC String Quartet (1949–52), appearing as soloist or concertmaster in many ABC concerts and broadcasts, conducting the ABC School Orchestral concerts, as an adjudicator for the ABC Concerto and Vocal Competitions and as a member of the Canberra Advisory Committee of the ABC.

Anabolic Video

Anabolic Video is an American pornographic movie studio headquartered in Chatsworth, California. The studio was a pioneer of gonzo pornography, and is considered one of the most successful gonzo producers.
History.
Anabolic was founded in 1991 by UCLA graduate and current Anabolic president Christopher Alexander (also known as performer Biff Malibu). Alexander claims to be "probably the second guy to get into gonzo, with the numbered series of movies under the same title". Anabolic and its former sister company Diabolic Video were originally headquartered in Venice, California for 10 years. The company soon became one of the pioneers in the field of gonzo pornography, along with other producers like Ed Powers, Rodney Moore and John Stagliano's Evil Angel Video. Gregg Alan ran the companies sales department for 15 years, starting in 1992.
In the mid-1990s, the company grew to incorporate Diabolic Video, owned by Gregg Alan. At the company's peak in the late 1990s/early 2000s, directors like Vince Vouyer, Erik Everhard, John Strong, Jon Dough and Lexington Steele created some of the most critically acclaimed gonzo on the market. Diabolic was created as a separate label in 1998. In 2001 Anabolic and Diabolic moved their headquarters to Chatsworth.
Vouyer's exit to work for Red Light District Video in 2002 eventually led to the mass exodus of 2004, which saw Everhard, Steele and Mike John leave for Red Light, and Dough leave for Devil's Film, where the directors were able to own their own movies. By 2006 the company had produced more than 300 films. In May 2007 Anabolic and Diabolic announced they were ending their partnership, and would operate as separate companies. Diabolic would be run and owned by Gregg Alan and Greg Alves.
Film series.
The companies most successful series include "Anabolic Penetration", "Balls Deep", "Sweet Cheeks", "Nasty Nymphos", "The Gangbang Girl", "Bring'um Young", "Initiations" and "World Sex Tour".
Actresses.
In 1999 Vivian Valentine received a black eye after being hit by Jon Dough during the filming of "Rough Sex", but she has said "I have no regrets or bad feelings about it". In June 2004 Alexis Amore signed an acting and directing deal under which she would direct eight to 10 movies and star in six films a year. This made her Anabolic's first "contract girl".
Directors.
All directors at Anabolic are under exclusive contract. Current and former Anabolic directors include former Diabolic employee Ricky D, Ken Dark, Ivan, Robby Digital, Tony T. and Sal Genoa.
Distribution deals.
In June 2006 gamelink.com added the complete Anabolic back-catalogue to its video-on-demand library. The same month it made its content available on AEBN's VOD service.
In March 2007 SugarVOD also began adding the complete Anabolic library to its video-on-demand service.
In November 2007 Anabolic signed a deal to distribute 65 Paradise Visuals films. Paradise has an extensive library of productions from the Golden Age of Porn, including Christy Canyon’s first feature film "Ginger Lynn The Movie", and John Holmes’ last film, "The Devil In Mr. Holmes".
Lawsuits.
In 2002 Anabolic and Diabolic filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles against several video distributors, alleging illegal copying and distribution of DVDs. The defendants were VIP Services Inc., Lynton Appelson Inc., Aware Distributors Inc. and others. The suit sought to recover illegal profits made from the sale of the fake DVDs, punitive damages and fees for copyright infringement. At least 25 of the two companies' titles had been pirated and supplied to retailers.
In late 1997 Harley-Davidson launched a lawsuit against the company in a federal court in Milwaukee. It objected to scenes in "The Gang Bang Girl 20" featuring its motorbikes and memorabilia. The company claimed the film tarnished its image, and could give the impression that Harley-Davidson approved the film.
Criticism.
Regan Starr appeared in "Rough Sex 2". According to her, "I got the shit kicked out of me." "I was told before the video - and they said this very proudly, mind you - that in this line most of the girls start crying because they're hurting so bad" "I couldn't breathe". "I was being hit and choked". "I was really upset, and they didn't stop". "They kept filming". "You can hear me say, 'Turn the fucking camera off', and they kept going". Director of the "Rough Sex" series Khan Tusion has commented that Starr "categorically misstates what occurred."
Professor Robert Jensen of the School of Journalism at the University of Texas has commented on the Anabolic production "A Cum Sucking Whore Named Kimberly". He alleges the film portrays Kimberly as merely "three holes and two hands", and that it is an example of "pornography that is rooted in the pain and humiliation of women". Anabolic's President and Founder Christopher Alexander states "At Anabolic we have the utmost respect for all of our talent, we allow them the artistic freedom to deliver scenes that are as wild as they wish them to be (with a few limits). We encourage the talent to be passionate, exciting, and to deliver the best scenes that they have ever done."
Awards.
The following is a selection of some of the major awards Anabolic films have won.

Winnie-the-Pooh

Winnie-the-Pooh, also called Pooh Bear, is a fictional anthropomorphic bear created by A. A. Milne. The first collection of stories about the character was the book "Winnie-the-Pooh" (1926), and this was followed by "The House at Pooh Corner" (1928). Milne also included a poem about the bear in the children’s verse book "When We Were Very Young" (1924) and many more in "Now We Are Six" (1927). All four volumes were illustrated by E. H. Shepard.
The Pooh stories have been translated into many languages, including Alexander Lenard's Latin translation, "Winnie ille Pu", which was first published in 1958, and, in 1960, became the only Latin book ever to have been featured on "The New York Times" Best Seller list.
In popular film adaptations, Pooh Bear has been voiced by actors Sterling Holloway, Hal Smith, and Jim Cummings in English and Yevgeny Leonov in Russian.
History.
Origin.
Milne named the character Winnie-the-Pooh for a teddy bear owned by his son, Christopher Robin Milne, who was the basis for the character Christopher Robin. Christopher's toys also lent their names to most of the other characters, except for Owl, Rabbit, and Gopher. Gopher was added to the Disney version. Christopher Robin's toy bear is now on display at the Main Branch of the New York Public Library in New York City.
Christopher Milne had named his toy bear after Winnie, a Canadian black bear he often saw at London Zoo, and "Pooh", a swan they had met while on holiday. The bear cub was purchased from a hunter for $20 by Canadian Lieutenant Harry Colebourn in White River, Ontario, Canada, while en route to England during the First World War. He named the bear "Winnie" after his adopted hometown in Winnipeg, Manitoba. "Winnie" was surreptitiously brought to England with her owner, and gained unofficial recognition as The Fort Garry Horse regimental mascot. Colebourn left Winnie at the London Zoo while he and his unit were in France; after the war she was officially donated to the zoo, as she had become a much loved attraction there. Pooh the swan appears as a character in its own right in "When We Were Very Young".
In the first chapter of "Winnie-the-Pooh", Milne offers this explanation of why Winnie-the-Pooh is often called simply "Pooh":
Ashdown Forest: the setting for the stories.
The Winnie-the-Pooh stories are set in Ashdown Forest, Sussex, England. The forest is a large area of tranquil open heathland on the highest sandy ridges of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty situated 30 miles (50 km) south of London. In 1925 Milne, a Londoner, bought a country home a mile to the north of the forest at Cotchford Farm, near Hartfield. According to Christopher Milne, while his father continued to live in London "...the four of us—he, his wife, his son and his son's nanny—would pile into a large blue, chauffeur-driven Fiat and travel down every Saturday morning and back again every Monday afternoon. And we would spend a whole glorious month there in the spring and two months in the summer." From the front lawn the family had a view across a meadow to a line of alders that fringed the River Medway, beyond which the ground rose through more trees until finally "above them, in the faraway distance, crowning the view, was a bare hilltop. In the centre of this hilltop was a clump of pines." Most of his father's visits to the forest at this time were, he noted, family expeditions on foot "to make yet another attempt to count the pine trees on Gill's Lap or to search for the marsh gentian". Christopher added that, inspired by Ashdown Forest, his father had made it "the setting for two of his books, finishing the second little over three years after his arrival".
Many locations in the stories can be linked to real places in and around the forest. As Christopher Milne wrote in his autobiography: "Pooh’s forest and Ashdown Forest are identical". For example, the fictional "Hundred Acre Wood" was in reality Five Hundred Acre Wood; Galleon's Leap was inspired by the prominent hilltop of Gill's Lap, while a clump of trees just north of Gill's Lap became Christopher Robin's "The Enchanted Place" because no-one had ever been able to count whether there were sixty-three or sixty-four trees in the circle.
The landscapes depicted in E.H. Shepard's illustrations for the Winnie-the-Pooh books were directly inspired by the distinctive landscape of Ashdown Forest, with its high, open heathlands of heather, gorse, bracken and silver birch punctuated by hilltop clumps of pine trees. Many of Shepard's illustrations can be matched to actual views, allowing for a degree of artistic licence. Shepard's sketches of pine trees and other forest scenes are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
The game of Poohsticks was originally played by Christopher Milne on a footbridge across a tributary of the River Medway in Posingford Wood, close to Cotchford Farm. The wooden bridge is a tourist attraction, and it has become traditional to play the game there using sticks gathered in nearby woodland. When the footbridge recently had to be replaced, the engineer designed a new structure based closely on the drawings of the bridge by E. H. Shepard in the original books, as the bridge did not originally appear as the artist drew it.
Character.
In the Milne books, Pooh is naive and slow-witted, but he is also friendly, thoughtful, and steadfast. Although he and his friends agree that he "has no Brain," Pooh is occasionally acknowledged to have a clever idea, usually driven by common sense. These include riding in Christopher Robin's umbrella to rescue Piglet from a flood, discovering "the North Pole" by picking it up to help fish Roo out of the river, inventing the game of Poohsticks, and getting Eeyore out of the river by dropping a large rock on one side of him to wash him towards the bank.
Pooh is also a talented poet, and the stories are frequently punctuated by his poems and "hums." Although he is humble about his slow-wittedness, he is comfortable with his creative gifts. When Owl's house blows down in a storm, trapping Pooh and Piglet and Owl inside, Pooh encourages Piglet (the only one small enough to do so) to escape and rescue them all by promising that "a respectful Pooh song" will be written about Piglet's feat. Later, Pooh muses about the creative process as he composes the song.
Pooh is very fond of food, especially "hunny" but also condensed milk and other items. When he visits friends, his desire to be offered a snack is in conflict with the impoliteness of asking too directly. Though intending to give Eeyore a pot of honey for his birthday, Pooh can not resist eating the honey on his way to deliver the present, and so instead gives Eeyore "a useful pot to put things in". When he and Piglet are lost in the forest during Rabbit's attempt to "unbounce" Tigger, Pooh finds his way home by following the "call" of the honeypots from his house. Pooh makes it a habit to have "a little something" around eleven o'clock in the morning. As the clock in his house "stopped at five minutes to eleven some weeks ago," any time can be Pooh's snack time.
Pooh is very social. After Christopher Robin, his closest friend is Piglet, and he most often chooses to spend his time with one or both of them. But he also habitually visits the other animals, often looking for a snack or an audience for his poetry as much as for companionship. His kind-heartedness means he goes out of his way to be friendly to Eeyore, visiting him and bringing him a birthday present and building him a house, despite receiving mostly disdain from Eeyore in return.
Sequel.
An authorised sequel "Return to the Hundred Acre Wood" was published on 5 October 2009. The author, David Benedictus, has developed, but not changed, Milne's characterisations. The illustrations, by Mark Burgess, are in the style of Shepard.
Stephen Slesinger.
On 6 January 1930, Stephen Slesinger purchased U.S. and Canadian merchandising, television, recording and other trade rights to the "Winnie-the-Pooh" works from Milne for a $1000 advance and 66% of Slesinger's income, creating the modern licensing industry. By November 1931, Pooh was a $50 million-a-year business. Slesinger marketed Pooh and his friends for more than 30 years, creating the first Pooh doll, record, board game, puzzle, US radio broadcast (NBC), animation, and motion picture film.
Red Shirt Pooh.
The first time Pooh and his friends appeared in colour was 1932, when he was drawn by Slesinger in his now-familiar red shirt and featured on an RCA Victor picture record. Parker Brothers also introduced "A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh Game" in 1933, again with Pooh in his red shirt. In the 1940s, Agnes Brush created the first plush dolls with Pooh in his red shirt. Shepard had drawn Pooh with a shirt as early as the first Winnie-The-Pooh book, which was subsequently coloured red in later coloured editions.
Disney.
After Slesinger's death in 1953, his wife, Shirley Slesinger Lasswell, continued developing the character herself. In 1961, she licensed rights to Walt Disney Productions in exchange for royalties in the first of two agreements between Stephen Slesinger, Inc. and Disney. The same year, A. A. Milne's widow, Daphne Milne, also licensed certain rights, including motion picture rights, to Disney.
Since 1966, Disney has released numerous animated productions starring Winnie the Pooh and related characters. These have included theatrical featurettes, television series, and direct-to-video films, as well as the theatrical feature-length films "The Tigger Movie", "Piglet's Big Movie", "Pooh's Heffalump Movie", and "Winnie the Pooh".
Merchandising revenue dispute.
Pooh videos, soft toys, and other merchandise generate substantial annual revenues for Disney. The size of Pooh stuffed toys ranges from Beanie and miniature to human-sized. In addition to the stylised Disney Pooh, Disney markets Classic Pooh merchandise which more closely resembles E.H. Shepard’s illustrations.
In 1991, Stephen Slesinger, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Disney which alleged that Disney had breached their 1983 agreement by again failing to accurately report revenue from Winnie the Pooh sales. Under this agreement, Disney was to retain approximately 98% of gross worldwide revenues while the remaining 2% was to be paid to Slesinger. In addition, the suit alleged that Disney had failed to pay required royalties on all commercial exploitation of the product name. Though the Disney corporation was sanctioned by a judge for destroying forty boxes of evidential documents, the suit was later terminated by another judge when it was discovered that Slesinger's investigator had rummaged through Disney's garbage in order to retrieve the discarded evidence. Slesinger appealed the termination, and on 26 September 2007, a three-judge panel upheld the lawsuit dismissal.
After the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, Clare Milne, Christopher Milne's daughter, attempted to terminate any future U.S. copyrights for Stephen Slesinger, Inc. After a series of legal hearings, Judge Florence-Marie Cooper of the US District Court in California found in favour of Stephen Slesinger, Inc., as did the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On 26 June 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case, sustaining the ruling and ensuring the defeat of the suit.
On 19 February 2007 Disney lost a court case in Los Angeles which ruled their "misguided claims" to dispute the licensing agreements with Slesinger, Inc. were unjustified, but a federal ruling of 28 September 2009, again from Judge Florence-Marie Cooper, determined that the Slesinger family had granted all trademark and copyright rights to Disney, although Disney must pay royalties for all future use of the characters. Both parties have expressed satisfaction with the outcome.
Adaptations.
Audio.
Selected Pooh stories read by Maurice Evans released on vinyl LP:
In 1960 HMV recorded a dramatised version with songs (music by Harold Fraser-Simson) of two episodes from "The House at Pooh Corner" (Chapters 2 and 8), starring Ian Carmichael as Pooh, Denise Bryer as Christopher Robin (who also narrated), Hugh Lloyd as Tigger, Penny Morrell as Piglet, and Terry Norris as Eeyore. This was released on a 45rpm EP.
In the 1970s and 1980s, Carol Channing recorded Winnie the Pooh, The House at Pooh Corner and The Winnie the Pooh Songbook, with music by Don Heckman. These were released on vinyl LP and audio cassette by Caedmon Records.
Unabridged recordings read by Peter Dennis of the four Pooh books:
In the 1990s, the stories were dramatised for audio by David Benedictus, with music composed, directed and played by John Gould. They were performed by a cast that included Stephen Fry as Winnie-the-Pooh, Jane Horrocks as Piglet, Geoffrey Palmer as Eeyore and Judi Dench as Kanga.

In the Soviet Union, three Winnie-the-Pooh, (transcribed in Russian as ""Vinni Pukh"") (Russian language: Винни-Пух) stories were made into a celebrated trilogy of short films by Soyuzmultfilm (directed by Fyodor Khitruk) from 1969 to 1972.
Films use Boris Zakhoder's translation of the book. Pooh was voiced by Yevgeny Leonov. Unlike the Disney adaptations, the animators did not base their depictions of the characters on Shepard's illustrations, creating a different look. The Russian adaptations make extensive use of Milne's original text, and often bring out aspects of Milne's characters' personalities not used in the Disney adaptations.

Legacy.
Winnie the Pooh has inspired multiple texts to explain complex philosophical ideas. Benjamin Hoff used Milne's characters in "The Tao of Pooh" and "The Te of Piglet" to explain Taoism. Similarly, Frederick Crews wrote essays about the Pooh books in abstruse academic jargon in "The Pooh Perplex" and "Postmodern Pooh" to satirise a range of philosophical approaches. "Pooh and the Philosophers" by John T. Williams uses Winnie the Pooh as a backdrop to illustrate the works of philosophers including Descartes, Kant, Plato and Nietzsche.
Pooh has also left a legacy in popular culture. Winnie-the-Pooh is such a popular character in Poland that a Warsaw street is named for him, "Ulica Kubusia Puchatka." There is also a street named after him in Budapest (Micimackó utca).
In music, Kenny Loggins wrote the song "House at Pooh Corner", which was originally recorded by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Loggins later rewrote the song as "Return to Pooh Corner", featuring on the album of the same name in 1991. Also, in Italy, a pop band took their name from Winnie, and were titled Pooh. In Estonia there is a punk/metal band called Winny Puhh.
In the "sport" of Poohsticks, competitors drop sticks into a stream from a bridge and then wait to see whose stick will cross the finish line first. Though it began as a game played by Pooh and his friends in the book "The House at Pooh Corner" and later in the films, it has crossed over into the real world: a World Championship Poohsticks race takes place in Oxfordshire each year. The Oxford University Winnie the Pooh Society was founded by undergraduates in 1982.

Short-term effects of alcohol

The concentration of alcohol in blood is usually measured in terms of the blood alcohol content. The amount and circumstances of consumption play a large part in determining the extent of intoxication; for example, eating a heavy meal before alcohol consumption causes alcohol to absorb more slowly. Hydration also plays a role, especially in determining the extent of hangovers. After excessive drinking, unconsciousness can occur and extreme levels of consumption can lead to alcohol poisoning and death (a concentration in the blood stream of 0.40% will kill half of those affected). Alcohol may also cause death by asphyxiation from vomit.
Alcohol is an addictive drug that can greatly exacerbate sleep problems. During abstinence, residual disruptions in sleep regularity and sleep patterns are the greatest predictors of relapse.
Sleep.
Moderate alcohol consumption and sleep disruptions.
Moderate alcohol consumption 30–60 minutes before sleep, although decreasing, disrupts sleep architecture. Rebound effects occur once the alcohol has been largely metabolized, causing late night disruptions in sleep maintenance. Under conditions of moderate alcohol consumption where blood alcohol levels average 0.06–0.08 percent and decrease 0.01–0.02 percent per hour, an alcohol clearance rate of 4–5 hours would coincide with disruptions in sleep maintenance in the second half of an 8-hour sleep episode. In terms of sleep architecture, moderate doses of alcohol facilitate "rebounds" in rapid eye movement (REM) following suppression in REM and stage 1 sleep in the first half of an 8-hour sleep episode, REM and stage 1 sleep increase well beyond baseline in the second half. Moderate doses of alcohol also very quickly increase (SWS) in the first half of an 8-hour sleep episode. Enhancements in REM sleep and SWS following moderate alcohol consumption are mediated by reductions in glutamatergic activity by adenosine in the central nervous system. In addition, tolerance to changes in sleep maintenance and sleep architecture develops within 3 days of alcohol consumption before bedtime.
Alcohol consumption and sleep improvements.
Low doses of alcohol (one beer) appear to increase total sleep time and reduce awakening during the night. The sleep-promoting benefits of alcohol dissipate at moderate and higher doses of alcohol. Previous experience with alcohol also influences the extent to which alcohol positively or negatively affects sleep. Under free-choice conditions, in which subjects chose between drinking alcohol or water, inexperienced drinkers were sedated while experienced drinkers were stimulated following alcohol consumption. In insomniacs, moderate doses of alcohol improve sleep maintenance.
Alcohol consumption and fatigue.
Conditions of fatigue correlate positively with increased alcohol consumption. In Northern climates, increased alcohol consumption during the winter is attributed to escalations in fatigue.
"Alcohol abstinence and sleep disruptions".
Hormonal imbalance and sleep disruption following withdrawal from chronic alcohol consumption are strong predictors of relapse. During abstinence, recovering alcoholics have attenuated melatonin secretion at onset of a sleep episode, resulting in prolonged sleep onset latencies. Psychiatry and core body temperatures during the sleep period contribute to poor sleep maintenance. The effect of alcohol consumption on the circadian control of human core body temperature is time dependent.
Alcohol consumption and balance.
Alcohol can affect balance, by changing the viscosity of the endolymph within the otolithic membrane, the fluid inside the semicircular canals inside the ear. The endolymph surrounds the cupula which contains hair cells within the semicircular canals. When the head is tilted, the endolymph flows and moves the cupula. The hair cells then bend and send signals to the brain indicating the direction in which the head is tilted. By changing the viscosity of the endolymph to become less dense when alcohol enters the system, the hair cells can move more easily within the ear, which sends the signal to the brain and results in exaggerated and overcompensated movements of body. This can also result in vertigo, or "the spins."
Effects by dosage.
Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on the subject.
The following lists the common effects of alcohol on the body, depending on the blood alcohol concentration (BAC). However, tolerance varies considerably between individuals, as does individual response to a given dosage; the effects of alcohol differ widely between people. Hence, BAC percentages are just estimates used for illustrative purposes.
Moderate doses.
Ethanol inhibits the ability of glutamate to open the cation channel associated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors. Stimulated areas include the cortex, hippocampus and nucleus accumbens, which are responsible for thinking and pleasure seeking. Another one of alcohol's agreeable effects is body relaxation, possibly caused by neurons transmitting electrical signals in an alpha waves-pattern; such waves are observed (with the aid of EEGs) when the body is relaxed.
Short-term effects of alcohol include the risk of injuries, violence and fetal damage. Alcohol has also been linked with lowered inhibitions, though it is unclear to what degree this is chemical versus psychological as studies with placebos can often duplicate the social effects of alcohol at low to moderate doses. Some studies have suggested that intoxicated people have much greater control over their behavior than is generally recognized, though they have a reduced ability to evaluate the consequences of their behavior. Behavioral changes associated with drunkenness are, to some degree, contextual. A scientific study found that people drinking in a social setting significantly and dramatically altered their behavior immediately after the first sip of alcohol, well before the chemical itself could have filtered through to the nervous system.
Areas of the brain responsible for planning and motor learning are sharpened. A related effect, caused by even low levels of alcohol, is the tendency for people to become more animated in speech and movement. This is due to increased metabolism in areas of the brain associated with movement, such as the nigrostriatal pathway. This causes reward systems in the brain to become more active, which may induce certain individuals to behave in an uncharacteristically loud and cheerful manner.
Alcohol has been known to mitigate the production of antidiuretic hormone, which is a hormone that acts on the kidney to favour water reabsorption in the kidneys during filtration. This occurs because alcohol confuses osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which relay osmotic pressure information to the posterior pituitary, the site of antidiuretic hormone release. Alcohol causes the osmoreceptors to signal that there is low osmotic pressure in the blood, which triggers an inhibition of the antidiuretic hormone. As a consequence, one's kidneys are no longer able to reabsorb as much water as they should be absorbing, leading to creation of excessive volumes of urine and the subsequent overall dehydration.
Excessive doses.
Acute alcohol intoxication through excessive doses in general causes short- or long-term health effects. NMDA receptors start to become unresponsive, slowing areas of the brain for which they are responsible. Contributing to this effect is the activity that alcohol induces in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system. The GABA system is known to inhibit activity in the brain. GABA could also be responsible for the memory impairment that many people experience. It has been asserted that GABA signals interfere with the "registration" and "consolidation" stages of memory formation. As the GABA system is found in the hippocampus (among other areas in the CNS), which is thought to play a large role in memory formation, this is thought to be possible.
Anterograde amnesia, colloquially referred to as "blacking out", is another symptom of heavy drinking. This is the loss of memory during and after an episode of drinking. When alcohol is consumed at a rapid rate, the point at which most healthy people's long-term memory creation starts to fail usually occurs at approximately 0.20% BAC, but can be reached as low as 0.14% BAC for inexperienced drinkers.
Another classic finding of alcohol intoxication is ataxia, in its appendicular, gait, and truncal forms. Appendicular ataxia results in jerky, uncoordinated movements of the limbs, as though each muscle were working independently from the others. Truncal ataxia results in postural instability; gait instability is manifested as a disorderly, wide-based gait with inconsistent foot positioning. Ataxia is responsible for the observation that drunk people are clumsy, sway back and forth, and often fall down. It is presumed to be due to alcohol's effect on the cerebellum.
Pathophysiology.
[[Image:Alcohol use disorders world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg|thumb|350px|Epidemiology: Disability-adjusted life year for alcohol use disorders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.
At low or moderate doses, alcohol acts primarily as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA. Alcohol binds to several different subtypes of GABAA, but not to others. The main subtypes responsible for the subjective effects of alcohol are the α1β3γ2, α5β3γ2, α4β3δ and α6β3δ subtypes, although other subtypes such as α2β3γ2 and α3β3γ2 are also affected. Activation of these receptors causes most of the effects of alcohol such as relaxation and relief from anxiety, sedation, ataxia and increase in appetite and lowering of inhibitions that can cause a tendency toward violence in some people.
Alcohol has a powerful effect on glutamate as well. Alcohol decreases glutamate's ability to bind with NMDA and acts as an antagonist of the NMDA receptor, which plays a critical role in LTP by allowing Ca2+ to enter the cell. These inhibitory effects are thought to be responsible for the "memory blanks" that can occur at levels as low as 0.03% blood level. In addition, reduced glutamate release in the dorsal hippocampus has been linked to spatial memory loss. Chronic alcohol users experience an upregulation of NMDA receptors because the brain is attempting to reestablish homeostasis. When a chronic alcohol user stops drinking for more than 10 hours, apoptosis can occur due to excitotoxicity. The seizures experienced during alcohol abstinence are thought to be a result of this NMDA upregulation. Alteration of NMDA receptor numbers in chronic alcoholics is likely to be responsible for some of the symptoms seen in delirium tremens during severe alcohol withdrawal, such as delirium and hallucinations. Other targets such as sodium channels can also be affected by high doses of alcohol, and alteration in the numbers of these channels in chronic alcoholics is likely to be responsible for as well as other effects such as cardiac arrhythmia. Other targets that are affected by alcohol include cannabinoid, opioid and dopamine receptors, although it is unclear whether alcohol affects these directly or if they are affected by downstream consequences of the GABA/NMDA effects. People with a family history of alcoholism may exhibit genetic differences in the response of their NMDA glutamate receptors as well as the ratios of GABAA subtypes in their brain.
Contrary to popular belief, research suggests that acute exposure to alcohol is not neurotoxic in adults and actually prevents NMDA antagonist-induced neurotoxicity.
Research.
Animal models using mammals and invertebrates have been informative in studying the effects of ethanol on not only pharmacokinetics of alcohol but also pharmacodynamics, in particular in the nervous system. Ethanol-induced intoxication is not uncommon in the animal kingdom, as noted here:
More recently, studies using animal models have begun to elucidate the effects of ethanol on the nervous system. Traditionally, many studies have been performed in mammals, such as mice, rats, and non-human primates. However, non-mammalian animal models have also been employed; in particular, Ulrike Heberlein group at UC San Francisco has used "Drosophila melanogaster", the fruit fly, taking advantage of its facile genetics to dissect the neural circuits and molecular pathways, upon which ethanol acts. The series of studies carried in the Heberlein lab has identified insulin and its related signaling pathways as well as biogenic amines in the invertebrate nervous system as being important in alcohol tolerance. The value of antabuse (disulfiram) as a treatment for alcoholism has been tested using another invertebrate animal model, the honey bees.
It is important to note that some of the analogous biochemical pathways and neural systems have been known to be important in alcohol's effects on humans, while the possibility that others may also be important remains unknown. Research of alcohol's effects on the nervous system remains a hot topic of research, as scientists inch toward understanding the problem of alcohol addiction.
In addition to the studies carried out in invertebrates, researchers have also used vertebrate animal models to study various effects of ethanol on behaviors.

Alison Mau

Alison "Ali" Mau (born 14 February 1965) is an Australian-born New Zealand television journalist and presenter. She was a co-host of TVNZ show "Seven Sharp", but left at the end of 2013 to work at Radio Live.
Career.
Born in Melbourne, Mau's first reporting job was for the "Warracknabeal Herald" in northern Victoria at age 18. In 1984 she was hired by the "Melbourne Herald". She moved to London in 1990 and presented and reported for "World Business Report" on BBC World. She returned to Australia in 1993 but moved to New Zealand soon after, where she was soon employed by Television New Zealand.
Her first television appearance was on the business-related current affairs show "Made in New Zealand". Mau would later present late-night current affairs programming including "Eyewitness" and "Newsnight", the latter of which she presented alongside Marcus Lush and her future husband Simon Dallow.
After a period reporting for ONE News, Mau began presenting the "Breakfast" programme with Mike Hosking. She returned to ONE News after the birth of her second child and, from 1999 to 2003, presented the weekend news alongside husband Simon Dallow. She returned to "Breakfast" in 2004 but left at the end of the year to join rival network Prime Television, where she worked with former TVNZ presenter Paul Holmes. She was made redundant from Prime when the station was taken over by Sky in early 2006 and returned to TVNZ in 2008.
Upon her return to TVNZ, Mau worked as a backup host for "Breakfast" and also appeared in other news, non-news, and current affairs shows including the home and lifestyle show "Home Front", which she presented alongside future Dunedin mayor Dave Cull. In 2010, she became co-host of weekly consumer affairs programme "Fair Go".
In 2013, she moved to co-host the nightly current affairs programme "Seven Sharp". Mau says that when she was recruited for Seven Sharp, the programme pitched to her was quite different from the one that eventuated. If she had known what the show would be like, she "never would have left the job at Fair Go". In 2014, she left to work at Radio Live.
Personal life.
Mau met Simon Dallow on a Contiki Tours tour in Europe in 1989. The pair began working together at TVNZ in 1994 and married in 1996. The couple divorced in 2009. They have two children. In 2010, following rumours of a same-sex relationship, she stated publicly that she is bisexual. She became engaged to Karleen Edmonds in February 2012.

James Deering Fessenden

James Deering Fessenden (September 28, 1833 – November 18, 1882) was a lawyer, politician, and soldier from the state of Maine who served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Primarily a staff officer and operations planner until the latter stages of the war, he commanded an infantry brigade in the Western Theater in 1864 and 1865. In 1862, he organized in South Carolina what became one of the first black regiments in the Federal army. He was a member of the powerful Fessenden family, which was prominent in national politics during the mid-19th century.
Early life and career.
James D. Fessenden was born in Westbrook, Maine, in the early autumn of 1833. He was the son of U.S. Senator William P. Fessenden and a brother of Francis Fessenden, who would also serve as a general in the Union army. Another brother, Samuel, would be killed at the Second Battle of Manassas during the war. Two uncles, Samuel C. Fessenden and T. A. D. Fessenden were U.S. Congressmen.
He was educated in the local schools and then graduated from Bowdoin College in 1852. He studied law, passed his bar exam, and joined his father's law firm.
Civil War.
After the outbreak of the Civil War in early 1861, Fessenden spent the summer recruiting and organizing a company of skilled riflemen and marksmen that became a company in the United States Sharpshooters. In November of that year, he received a commission as a captain in the sharpshooter company and served in the defenses of Washington, D.C. Through the influences of his powerful father, he received a promotion to lieutenant colonel and a new position as a staff officer and aide-de-camp to Union Maj. Gen. David Hunter. He held that position from March 1862 until January 1863, serving primarily in the Department of the South and the X Corps. During that period, he was promoted to colonel in July 1862. He was involved in planning the Union operations against the Confederate defenses of Charleston, South Carolina, but missed participating in the major attacks while recovering in Washington, D.C., from a riding accident suffered in the field. During his recuperation, he frequently used his oratory and organizational skills to recruit new volunteers for military service.
In November 1863, Fessenden became an aide-de-camp to Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, who had been sent to Tennessee with two corps of the Army of the Potomac to reinforce the Army of the Cumberland. Hooker commended him for his bravery at the Battle of Missionary Ridge and recommended his promotion to brigadier general. He was commended three times for his actions during the Atlanta Campaign and again recommended for higher rank by Hooker.
In August 1864, he finally received his long desired promotion to brigadier general, but did not get a field command initially as his sponsor Hooker had since left the army. He was assigned to command a brigade in the Army of the Shenandoah in the Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia, an assignment initially meant for his brother, who lost a leg in the Red River Campaign that precluded his taking the assignment. James Fessenden arrived in Virginia and assumed command of a brigade in the XIX Corps under Maj. Gen. William H. Emory. He participated in the Battle of Cedar Creek in October, engaged in scouting duty, and then was assigned command of the Union garrison in the defenses of Winchester, Virginia, in January 1865.
In May 1865, he led his brigade in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington, D.C., following the surrender of the two leading Confederate armies in the Eastern Theater. He subsequently commanded troops under Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock and an occupation garrison in South Carolina before mustering out of the army on January 15, 1866. He received a brevet promotion to major general before leaving the service.
Postbellum career.
Fessenden returned to Maine, where he resumed his law career in partnership with his surviving brother Francis. He entered local and state politics, and was elected to serve three terms in the Maine State Legislature. He also served the Federal government as the Register of Bankruptcy for his district. Late in his life, he edited his brother's book, "Life and Services of William Pitt Fessenden", which was published posthumously in 1907.
He was a member of the Maine Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States - a military society for officers who has served in the Union during the Civil War.
James D. Fessenden died in Portland, Maine, where he is buried in Evergreen Cemetery.

DB Class 65

The steam locomotives of DB Class 65 were newly designed, German, passenger train tank locomotives, built for the Deutsche Bundesbahn after the Second World War. They were intended for suburban and commuter trains serving German cities, where they were to replace Classes 78 and 93.5. As a result they were allocated to the locomotive depots ("Bahnbetriebswerke" or "BW") at Darmstadt, Düsseldorf and Letmathe. Between Düsseldorf and Essen they were even used on early S-Bahn services. And between Limburg/Lahn and Wiesbaden and in the area of Darmstadt they also hauled goods trains. 
The firm of Krauss-Maffei initially delivered 13 engines in 1951 and a further 5 from 1955 to 1956. The first engine, with operating number 65 001, was retired as early as 1966.
All the vehicles were given a welded, high-performance boiler. Operating numbers 65 001 - 65 013 were equipped with a surface economizer. Numbers 65 014 - 65 018 were given a mixer preheater. Numbers 65 012 - 65 018 were equipped for push-pull services. So there were three different variants of these two-cylinder, superheated steam engines in service with the Bundesbahn.
Class 65 locomotives proved to be exceptionally reliable engines, but they could not be used universally, because their coal bunkers and water tanks were small. As a result they could only be used for short-range goods traffic.
Locomotive 65 018 was given a special lightweight drive, which was later used on all the engines. This locomotive is the only representative of its class to have survived in working order and is owned by the "Stoom Stichting Nederland" society in the Netherlands, having been donated by a German railway museum in 1981. It was retired from "Bw" Aschaffenburg in 1972, the last one of these attractive locomotives to be paid off.

Bell Labs Holmdel Complex

The Bell Labs Holmdel Complex functioned for forty-four years as a research and development facility, initially for the Bell System. The centerpiece of the campus is an Eero Saarinen designed structure that served as the home to over 6,000 engineers and researchers. This modernist building, dubbed "The Biggest Mirror Ever" by "Architectural Forum", due to its mirror box exterior, was the site of at least one Nobel Prize discovery, the laser cooling work of Steven Chu.
__TOC__
History.
Before the present building, the site was used by Bell Telephone Laboratories for research, most notably Karl Guthe Jansky invented radio astronomy there. A monument was placed at the former location of the antenna almost seventy years later in 1998. The monument is a stylized sculpture of the antenna and is oriented as Jansky's antenna was at 7:10 p.m. on September 16, 1932, at a moment of maximum signal caused by alignment with the center of our galaxy in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.
In 1957 the Bell Telephone Company began to plan a research laboratory in Holmdel Township, New Jersey Constructed between 1959 and 1962, this complex was one of the final projects of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen before his death in 1961. Used as a research and development complex, it served the needs of the Bell Laboratories division of Bell Telephone, later known as AT&T, Lucent, and Alcatel-Lucent. Basic research, applied hardware development, and software development occurred in the building.
The building's distinctive features, including its mirror-like appearance, led to recognition as the Laboratory of the Year by R&D in 1967.
The building was subsequently expanded in 1966 and 1982 to its final size of two million square feet of office and laboratory space. Despite these expansions, the original curtain wall design remained intact, as did the unique layout of the site, which included a large elliptical master plan and country-road like approach. Over its active life-span, the facility and its layout was studied in universities as a model of modernist architecture. Internally, the building is divided into four pavilions of labs and offices, each around an atrium. The internal pavilions are linked via sky-bridges and perimeter walkway.
Also of note is the water tower on the complex, which was designed to look like the then-new transistor and is still in usable condition more than 40 years after its construction.
Post Alcatel-Lucent.
In 2006, Alcatel-Lucent contracted to sell the facility to Preferred Real Estate Investments in the process of restructuring the company's research efforts. Despite initial plans to maintain the original buildings and keep the complex as a corporate office park, economic developments later resulted in Preferred seeking to re-zone as residential property. As a result, the complex was added to The Cultural Landscape Foundation's list of 10 Most Endangered Historic Sites in New Jersey in May 2007. Additionally action led to the creation of a citizen's group, Preserving Holmdel, by former Bell employees, to lobby for keeping the complex as it was when in use as a laboratory. Working with the community, ideas for changes such as a university center or recreational complex, in portions of the former facility are under consideration.
The Preferred transaction did not close and on May 17, 2012 Holmdel Township declared the site as an "Area in Need of Redevelopment" and adopted a Redevelopment Plan for the property that included various adaptive reuses of the main building and the construction of up to 40 single family homes and 185 age-restricted townhouses outside the main ring road surrounding the building. The Redevelopment Plan is available on the Township's website. The complex is currently under contract to Somerset Development LLC. Somerset has provided concept plans for the redevelopment of the complex in accordance with the Redevelopment Plan and is in discussions with Township officials concerning the details of those plans. Somerset's Redevelopment Concepts are available online and on the Township's website.

Smith predictor

The Smith predictor (invented by O. J. M. Smith in 1957) is a type of predictive controller for systems with pure time delay. The idea can be illustrated as follows. 
Suppose the plant consists of formula_1 followed by a pure time delay formula_2.
As a first step, suppose we only consider formula_1 (the plant without a delay) and design a controller formula_4 with a closed-loop transfer function formula_5 that we consider satisfactory.
Next, our objective is to design a controller formula_6 for the plant formula_7 so that the closed loop transfer function formula_8 equals formula_9.
Solving formula_10,
we obtain
formula_11. The controller is implemented as shown in the following figure, where formula_1 has been changed to formula_13 to indicate that it is a model used by the controller.
Note that there are two feedback loops. The outer control loop feeds the output back to the input, as usual. However, this loop alone would not provide satisfactory control, because of the delay; this loop is feeding back outdated information. Intuitively, for the k seconds during which no fresh information is available, the system is controlled by the inner loop which contains a predictor of what the (unobservable) output of the plant G currently is. 
To check that this works, a re-arrangement can be made as follows:
Here we can see that if the model used in the controller, formula_14, matches the plant formula_7 perfectly, then the outer and middle feedback loops cancel each other, and the controller generates the "correct" control action.

Tony Brooker

Ralph Anthony "Tony" Brooker (born 1925, England) is a British academic who was a computer scientist known for developing the Mark 1 Autocode.
He graduated in Mathematics from Imperial College in 1945 and returned there in 1947 as Assistant Lecturer. His first computer project was the construction of a fast multiplier unit from electro-mechanical relays. This was taken over by K. D. Tocher and incorporated into ICCE, the Imperial College Computing Engine based on the same technology. By then (1949) Tony had moved to the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory to work for Maurice Wilkes on software development for EDSAC.
In October 1951 Tony joined the Computing Machine Laboratory at Manchester University, where he took over from Alan Turing the task of writing programming manuals and running a user service on the Ferranti Mark 1 computer. It was his experience with the rather tedious Manchester machine-coding conventions that led him to devise what was probably the world's first publicly available High-Level Language. This was the Mark 1 Autocode available from March 1954 and therefore about two years ahead of the first Fortran compiler.
Throughout the 1950s Tony led a group at Manchester working on the theoretical underpinnings of compilers. This culminated in the compiler-compiler, a seminal idea first presented at a British Computer Society Conference in July 1960 by Brooker and Morris. This was subsequently implemented on the Ferranti ATLAS and used for high-level language development. The ATLAS was regarded as the world's most powerful computer when it was brought into service in December 1962.
In the mid-1960s Tony helped to inaugurate the UK's first Computer Science degree course at Manchester. He moved to Essex University in 1967 to take up the University's founding Chair of Computer Science. The first Essex Computer Science graduates obtained their degrees in the summer of 1970. He retired in 1988.

Sanlu Group

Sanlu Group CO., Ltd. (SJZSGCZ) was a state-owned Chinese dairy products company based in Xinhua District, Shijiazhuang, the capital city of Hebei Province. It produced one of the oldest and most popular brands of infant formula in China. New Zealand's Fonterra owned 43% of Sanlu.
In September 2008, it was involved in an adulterated milk powder scandal, affecting some 294,000 Chinese infants and killing six. Their baby milk powder had been tainted with melamine, which can cause kidney stones and other complications. It received a bankruptcy order from Shijiazhuang Court on 24 December 2008, and several of its top managers were sentenced to long prison terms.
Ownership and business.
The company began as Shijiazhuang Dairy Company (SDC). After several acquisitions in 1995, Sanlu Group was formed in 1996. Tian Wenhua, then General Manager of SDC, became President and General Manager of Sanlu. Under Tian, Sanlu led the Chinese powder market for 13 consecutive years in terms of sales. Tian was considered one of the most successful entrepreneurs in China for her role in building the company. She was named deputy chairman of the China Dairy Industry Association (中国乳制品工业协会), and elected to the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The company was a collective; managers and workers both owned shares of Sanlu.
Sanlu became Shijiazhuang's largest taxpayer since it had become the largest formula seller in China for a continuous 15 year period. Richard McGregor, author of "", said that Sanlu became "an invaluable asset for a city otherwise struggling to attract industry and investment on a par with China's premier metropolises."
In December 2005, a joint venture agreement was signed which involved New Zealand dairy cooperative Fonterra taking a 43% equity stake in the Chinese dairy by injecting ¥864 million. The joint venture company started trading in 2006. The majority 56% stake is owned by Shijiazhuang Three Deers Limited (石家庄三鹿有限公司).
Expansion.
In February 2006, the group opened a dairy plant in Tangshan with annual capacity of 200,000 tons of formula milk powder. At the time of signing the joint venture contract with Fonterra, the company declared it would invest 3 billion yuan for external growth, with the aim of forming a national industrial network over the next three years. In April 2006, Sanlu acquired a liquid milk production base in Weifang, Shandong,capable of producing 300,000 tons of liquid milk every year, at an outlay of 400 million yuan. In October of the same year, the company invested in a production facility with capacity of 100,000 tons of lactic acid bacteria drink and yoghurt in Xinxiang, Henan, at a cost of 120 million yuan.
In 2007, its sales reached ¥10 billion. Milk powder sales of the group ranked number 1 for 15 consecutive years, with a market share of 18 percent. The company prided itself on its stringent quality control procedures, boasting its extremely rigorous tests on its products. "Made in China", a special edition of the CCTV program ""Quality Reports Weekly"", aired on 2 September 2007, and focused on the company. It claimed over 1,000 different tests were carried out before its products leave the factory. To that end, on 8 January 2008, it was awarded second prize at the 2007 National Scientific Techniques Awards in the category of 'Innovative infant formula research and other related techniques'. A number of its products were exempt from government inspection for having passed government quality checks three times in succession. Sanlu is one of the largest employers in Shijiazhuang, with close to 10,000 people on its payroll.
Demise.
In September 2008, Sanlu came to international attention due to product concerns regarding its infant milk formula, which was discovered to have been contaminated with melamine, a non-alimentary chemical which causes kidney stones. An estimated 300,000 babies became ill, and six cases resulted in death.
The Xinhua News Agency reported that Sanlu received its first complaints about baby milk in December 2007. Fonterra was alerted to the contamination on 2 August. There was an immediate trade recall, but Fonterra said that local administrators refused an official recall. Fonterra notified the New Zealand government on 5 September. Three days later, Prime Minister, Helen Clark had Beijing officials alerted directly. Clark accused the company and officials of covering up to avoid an official recall.
On 15 September, the company issued a public apology for the contaminated milk powder; Sanlu was ordered to halt production, and to destroy all unsold and recalled products. Authorities reportedly seized 10,000 tons of product.
After testing samples from 491 batches of products sold by all 109 companies producing baby milk powder, the National Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said that all 11 samples from Sanlu failed the melamine test. Sanlu, whose products sell at half the price of equivalents on the market, recorded the highest levels of contamination among all the samples tested, at 2,563 ppm.
Tian Wenhua (田文華), Chairman and General Manager of Sanlu and Party Secretary was stripped of her party and functional posts during an extraordinary meeting of the Hebei provincial standing committee of the Communist Party of China. Four Shijiazhuang officials, including vice mayor in charge of food and agriculture, Zhang Fawang, were reportedly removed from office. Mayor Ji Chuntang reportedly resigned on 17 September; Tian was charged under Articles 144 and 150 of the criminal code.
Since Sanlu, the region's largest purchaser of milk, was ordered to halt production, many small dairy farmers were put into hardship. On 24 September, Fonterra announced that it had written down the carrying value of its investment by NZ$139 million (two-thirds), reflecting the costs of product recall and the impairment of the 'Sanlu' brand "as a direct consequence of the criminal contamination of milk in China". Chairman Henry van der Heyden said that the contamination was a criminal act which Fonterra could not have prevented. On 26 September, Fonterra CEO denied that Fonterra is selling its stake of 43% of Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group Co.
Breakup.
On 27 September 2008, China Economic Net reported that Sanlu may have been bankrupted and soon be taken over by Beiijng Sanyuan Food Company Ltd.. In November, it was announced that the Sanyuan Group would acquire 4 of Sanlu's Shijiazhuang plants, and plants in Tangshan, Shandong and Henan, and would assume some of Sanlu's debt. Consideration was not disclosed, but sum is said to be of the order of ¥ 800 million.
On 19 December, Sanlu secured a loan of ¥902 million to pay medical expenses of and compensation to children affected by tainted milk powder it produced. It was announced on 25 December that Shijiazhuang court accepted a creditor's bankruptcy petition against Sanlu, which reportedly had net debt of ¥1.1 billion. Shijiazhuang city, the controlling shareholder, hopes to sell its distribution network as a going concern.
Trial of executives.
Four Sanlu executives went on trial on 31 December 2008 charged with producing and selling fake or substandard products. Tian Wenhua, former general manager, former deputy general managers Wang Yuliang and Hang Zhiqi, and Wu Jusheng, a former head of Sanlu's milk division appeared in court. Tian pleaded guilty to her role in the scandal, and expressed her remorse, and also called for China to consider embracing the European Union's standards on melamine. Wang, who had leaped off a building in a suicide attempt, offered his apology and remorse: "When I think of the children who were harmed ... I feel extreme inadequacy towards these sick children and their parents."
On 22 January 2009, Tian was sentenced to life imprisonment, while other Sanlu executives received sentences of five to fifteen years. Two other men were sentenced to death. Tian was also ordered to pay a fine of 20 million yuan (US$2.9 million). Sanlu was fined 50 million yuan ($7.3 million) despite its bankruptcy.

You Can Heal Your Life

You Can Heal Your Life is 1984 self-help and new thought book by Louise L. Hay. It was the second book by the author, after "Heal your Body" which she wrote at age 60. After Hay appeared on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" and "Donahue" in the same week in March 1988, the book landed on the New York Times Best Seller list and by 2008 over 35 million copies worldwide had been sold, in over in 30 languages. The book was also instrumental in the success of her publishing company, Hay House Inc. Today, due to the book she is "one of the best-selling authors in history", and one of largest selling women authors, after J. K. Rowling, Danielle Steel and Barbara Cartland. 
Premise.
The key premise of the book is that because the mind and body are connected, illnesses of the body have their root causes in emotional and spiritual aspects of the mind and its beliefs and thought processes. While modern medicine concerns itself solely with eliminating the negative symptoms of disease in the body, using tools such as chemotherapy and other pharmaceutical drugs and various surgical techniques, Hay's approach is to identify and work to resolve the mental root causes of disease. If it is accepted that the causes of "dis-ease" include stress and unhealthy thought patterns and beliefs about oneself, then it follows that the most fundamental way to affect positive change in the body is to change the way we think, using tools such as "mirror work" and affirmations. At the end of book, a separate section lists numerous illnesses and the emotional thought patterns that tend to cause them; this was derived from Hay's earlier book, "Heal Your Body", which had its origins in a pamphlet she published in 1979. 
The film.
In 2007, the book was adapted into a documentary film of the same name, with screenplay written by Gay Hendricks and directed by Michael A. Goorjian.
