George Barlow (poet)

George Barlow (19 June 1847, London – 1913 or 1914) was an English poet, who sometimes wrote under the pseudonym James Hinton. 
Barlow was the son of George Barnes Barlow, Master of the Crown Office, and was educated at Harrow School and Exeter College, Oxford. He moved to London in 1871, and continued to live there after his marriage a year later. A prolific poet, his collected "Poetical Works" amounted to over 3,000 pages of verse. Barlow was dubbed the 'Bard of the sixteen sonnets a day' by his acquaintance Charles Marston, and 'the Poet of spiritualism' by Edward Bennett; his sonnet sequences explored spiritualism and erotic love.
In addition to his published poetry oeuvre, Barlow wrote at least two non-fiction books, "History of the Dreyfus case" (1898) and "The genius of Dickens". He was a regular contributor to the "Contemporary Review".

Born in the Gardens

Born In The Gardens is a comedy play by Bristol-born playwright Peter Nichols.
Nichols wrote the play in 1979, after his now famous drama "Privates On Parade" was rejected by the Bristol Old Vic for being too controversial. "Born In The Gardens" was staged in the Theatre Royal (now the Bristol Old Vic) to celebrate its 200th anniversary. The cast for the premiere included Beryl Reid, Peter Bowles, Barry Foster and Jennie Linden and the production transferred to the Gielgud Theatre in London where it played for nine months. A TV version with Constance Chapman replacing Reid was shown in 1986.
The play centres on an elderly Bristolian mother and son living in a crumbling Victorian manor house.
The title comes from a sign in the Polar Bear enclosure in Bristol Zoological gardens and referred to a polar bear called Misha.
It was revived by the Peter Hall Company in 2008, beginning a run at the Theatre Royal, Bath, before embarking on a national tour. Stephanie Cole starred as Maud, and the cast also included Simon Shepherd, Allan Corduner, and Miranda Foster.

Voralpen Express

The Voralpen-Express (VAE, Pre-Alpine Express) is a named train connecting medium sized cities in central and eastern Switzerland, carrying this name since 1992. It is operated by Südostbahn (SOB) and runs every hour between St. Gallen and Lucerne.
History.
The first through trains from Romanshorn to Arth-Goldau started in 1940 after the electrification of the Südostbahn line between Rapperswil and Arth-Goldau. Romanshorn–Rapperswil had been under wires since 1926/31. The trains were jointly operated by Bodensee–Toggenburg-Bahn (BT), Südostbahn (SOB) and the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB). 1944 BT added buffet cars to the trainsets. 1947 some trains continued from Arth-Goldau to Lucerne. In 1960 operation was changed to push-pull operation with very powerful motor coaches. The trainsets were now painted in green an cream. 1982 brought the clock-face timetable with a train Romanshorn–Lucerne every two hours but also the end for buffet cars. In 1991 BT and SOB bought EW IV inter-city coaches to replace the push-pull sets. 1995 unnamed trains every two hours were added between Romanshorn and Arth-Goldau, again with push-pull sets. After Revvivo-coaches had been used for these trains from 1997 on, it was decided to sell the EW IV to SBB and buy more Revvivos to allow an hourly push-pull trainset between Romanshorn and Lucerne. 2001 BT and SOB merged into the new SOB, which reduced the number of participating companies to two. VAE ran as an InterRegio (IR) express train until 2013.
On 15 December 2013 the concept changed and SOB became the sole operator. VAE became a distinct train category but the train was limited to St. Gallen–Lucerne. To cope with the increasing number of passengers, trains now generally have seven coaches, which means that two locomotives or motor coaches are needed. This is due to the 50‰ (1:20) grades between Pfäffikon SZ and Arth-Goldau. Motive power is at each end, allowing a push-pull service without driving trailers.
Geography.
Besides creating a tangential link on the southern edge of the greater Zurich area, it is popular for the pre-alpine scenery. The most important stations with connecting trains and regular boat lines on the lakes are:
Rolling stock.
Fourteen locomotioves and motor coaches form seven pairs of motive power for the Voralpen-Express:
The different types cannot be combined. If less than five pairs are available, SOB leases a Re 4/4 II from SBBC (in February 2014 it was Re 421 393) which can be used together with an Re 446.
Five trainsets are needed for the daily operation and a sixth set is in Herisau as a reserve. It allows to exchange the sets in order to clean and maintain them. The six sets are formed from two locomotives with seven coaches:
or with two motor coaches and six coaches:
The seventh pair of locomotives is an additional reserve. Thus, if one motor coach RBDe needs maintenance, an additional set with locomotives will be formed.
31 air-conditioned Revvivo coaches, 1997/99 rebuilt from Einheitswagen I coaches, are the backbone of the VAE coaching stock. Ten quite recent NPZ vehicles (1991/95) were added to the stock to allow for enough capacity. Four older coaches are kept as a reserve but the Revvivo prototype of 1995 (BR 748) has been withdrawn.

Boys of Steel

Boys of Steel: The Creators of Superman is an all-ages picture book written by Marc Tyler Nobleman and illustrated by Ross MacDonald. It's the first picture book biography of Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, and is the first ever stand-alone biography of the pair.
Synopsis.
Jerome Siegel and Joseph Shuster are meek, bespectacled teens in Depression-era Cleveland who seek escape in the worlds of science fiction and pulp magazine adventure tales. 
"In a crowded high school hallway, Jerry wishes he could be with his 'friends,' and a turn of the page reveals Tarzan, Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers. Joe, 'lousy at sports and mousy around girls,' draws sci-fi heroes with a passion. In 1934, when both are 20, Jerry dreams up the Superman concept and Joe draws prototypes labeled 'S' for 'super.' And for 'Siegel' and 'Shuster.'" 
It is four more years before they convince a publisher to take a chance on their character in the new comic book format. 
"In June 1938, their creation launches in "Action Comics". Nobleman details this achievement with a zest amplified by MacDonald's punchy illustrations, done in a classic litho palette of brassy gold, antique blue and fireplug red. MacDonald's Depression-era vignettes picture Siegel pondering his superhero's powers and the friends casting a single, caped shadow. A cautionary afterword chronicles their protracted financial struggles with DC Comics--when Siegel and Shuster sold their first Superman story, they also sold all rights to the character, for $130." 
Background.
Nobleman revealed to Newsarama's Zack Smith that he first heard the origin story in high school, around 1988, but it wasn't until college graduation that he decided to write it up as a screenplay. However, warnings that the reclusive Siegel was unlikely to talk about Superman's beginnings discouraged Nobleman enough to give up the idea. He got into children's publishing, and a few years later decided to tell the story as a picture book. 
He set a timeframe of about ten years, closing his tale before the bitter legal battles that ultimately separated the idealistic young creators from their creation. The writer wanted "Boys of Steel" to end on a high note, emphasizing the friendship and initial triumph of two Depression-era underdogs who wouldn't stop believing in Superman. 
While conducting his research, the writer was not able to contact the Siegel or Shuster families. Between published interviews with the creators (from which he cribbed his dialogue) and archival information gathered in Cleveland, Nobleman easily was able to build the framework for his version of the story. 
The search for an illustrator didn't commence for at least six months after Nobleman sold "Boys of Steel" to Random House in March '05. The publisher pitched MacDonald ("Another Perfect Day"), whose Art Deco style already was familiar to Nobleman. 
Praise.
“robust treatment does [Shuster and Siegel’s story justice.”
"Booklist, June 1, 2008" 
Trivia.
"I never say the word 'Superman,'" Nobleman pointed out. "I say the word 'Super,' but never 'Superman' in the story proper. It's a fun little trick about the power of observation and the power of picture books. I had an illustrator to show it, so I never had to say 'Superman' even once."

Big Brother Norway

Big Brother Norge was the Norwegian version of reality TV show Big Brother and was aired from 2001 to 2003 on TV Norge for three moderately successful seasons. In 2005 and 2006 it was merged with the Swedish version of the show. A new season of the programme was launched in late August 2011 on TV2 Bliss.
The Grand Prize.
Big Brother Norge Season 1, Big Brother Norge Season 2, Big Brother Norge Season 3, and Big Brother Norge Season 4 had grand prize 1,000,000 NOK.
Big Brother Norge - Tilbake I Huset had no grand prize.
Big Brother 1.
Season 1 of "Big Brother Norge" premiered on February 24, 2001 and ran until May 31, 2001. 10 housemates entered the house on launch night with two Intruders immediately following on the second day of the Show. The original housemates then had to decide whom of Natalie and Roy they wanted to keep in the house. Natalie was evicted. First victim of the public voting was Rebekka, who eventually made a return to the show as one of the twists of the season. When Per Morten made the shows only voluntary exit on Day 85 the audience had the chance to vote yet another former evictee back into the house. Since Rebekka already returned and Natalie not recognized as an official housemate by Big Brother (they put her profile off the homepage once she was evicted) the audience had to choose out of Trond, Mónica, Roy and Rodney. With massive support, the latest evictee Rodney was allowed to make a comeback.<br>
Two showmances had huge impact on the show since both resulting couples (Annette and Rodney; Anne Mona and Ramsy) remained in the house until the last week. However it was Lars Joakim Ringom who gained the most popularity and was crowned the winner of the season in a close vote beating runner-up Anita E. Sundt Olsen by 2% only. Both housemates have been quite popular and have never been nominated.<br>
Annette Young, who gained the 3rd runner-up position on final night, eventually became a co-host of future "Big Brother Norge" seasons.<br>
This was the first time that the rules of a Big Brother edition were changed to a minimum of three housemates being up for eviction on every nomination round in comparison to the usual two.
Nominations Table.
Housemates Nominate for 2 Points (top of box) and 1 Point (bottom of box) and the three or more Housemates with the most Nomination Points face the Public Vote to evict.
<br>Notes:
<br> On Day 2 two new Housemates, Natalie and Roy, entered the House. On Day Four the Housemates had to decide which one of them to evict, and Natalie left the House after receiving the most votes.
<br> Rebekka returned to the House on Day 65.
<br> On Day 85 Per Morten left the House voluntarily. He was facing Eviction along with Anne Mona and Rebekka, but all votes for him were discounted and the Eviction left between Anne Mona and Rebekka, with Rebekka laving after receiving 53% to Anne Mona's 47%. Viewers voted for which Ex-Housemate they wanted to replace Per Morten. They voted for Rodney who re-entered the House on Day 86, shortly after Rebekka's second Eviction. Rodney was chosen with 56% of the vote, to Trond's 17%, Mónica's 14% and Roy's 13%.
<br> There were no Nominations this Week, instead all Housemates faced the vote to win.
Big Brother Norge - Tilbake I Huset.
"Big Brother Norge - Tilbake I Huset (Back In The House)" was a spin-off of the first season which was set 100 days after that seasons final and lasted 9 days running from November 17 to November 25, 2001. Several season 1 housemates re-entered the house together with four new personalities: Annika, Christian, Claus and Leena, who competed to become a housemate on the shows next regular season. Since Claus made a voluntary exit halfway through the audience had to choose between the remaining three and voted Leena (real name: Lina) Breeke the winner who was therefor the first known housemate for the next season.<br>
The main highlight of the show was the wedding between season 1 houseguests Ramsy and Mona which marked the first time worldwide that a couple would marry inside a Big Brother house. Boyband Westlife made an appearance as live guests during the wedding and performed.
Big Brother 2.
The second season of "Big Brother Norge" started on February 24, 2002 and ended on June 2 of the same year. As it was decided on "Tilbake I Huset", Leena Brekke, now under her real name Lina, was already certain to move into the house together with 11 others on launch night. Juse like in the other year, two intruders made their way to the house on Day 2: Gro Anita and Espen. Both of them were automatically up for eviction, however, next to them two of the original housemates who received the most nominations, Jan Arne and Verónica were also in danger of leaving the house on what was a double elimination in the very first week. Jan Arne and Gro Anita, whoms stay in the house only lasted for 2 days, got evicted.<br>
Although being elected by the public to enter the house, Lina found herself in the unlucky position to get nominated by Big Brother in week 2 and immediately getting the boot out of five nominated housemates.<br>
After 99 Days, Verónica Agnes Roso from Lørenskog was voted the winner over Espen Vesterdal Larsen and three others. Both Verónica and Espen have been up for eviction in the very first week and Verónica got nominated even 5 out of the 8 nomination rounds.
Nominations Table.
<br>Notes:
<br> Line and Verónika-Kathrin were automatically nominated for discussing nominations.
<br> Lise-Marie and Kristian were automatically nominated for cheating in the weekly task.
<br> There were no Nominations this Week, instead all Housemates faced the vote to win.
Big Brother 3 - Next Generation.
Under the Name "Big Brother Norge - Next Generation" the show returned in its third year running from March 8 to May 15, 2003. Running for only 69 days, it was the shortest main season of the show and saw a major twist in a house divide which was already used in several "Big Brother" versions worldwide before: The household was split into two parts with one living on the luxurious side of the house having access to privileges like a jacuzzi, hot water and comfort beds while the other side was lacking of all of this and was forced to live with basics only.<br>
In this edition, the audience got the chance to nominate their two most disliked housemates with the most vote getter receiving two, and the 2nd most vote getter receiving one point for nomination.<br>
Although lasting for only ten weeks the season saw the most voluntary exits in the history of "Big Brother Norge" with three male housemates walking and therefor making place for three replacement contestants.<br>
With 39.4% to win Eva Lill Baukhol triumphed over Halvor Kvikstad, who achieved 36.4% in a close race.<br>
Three years after his participation contestant Ronny Furnes was found dead on May 30, 2007 at the age of 37.
Big Brother 4.
The series started on Monday 29 August 2011, and was aired on TV 2 Bliss for 98 days with the finale on 4 December 2011. TV2 bought the Norwegian television rights for Big Brother and will air a fourth season in 2011. The main presenters are Petter Pilgaard and Sarah Natasha Melbye. Tine Barstad won series on 4 December 2011.

<doc id="19245547" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19245547" title="Deductive fallacy">
Deductive fallacy

A deductive fallacy is defined as a deductive argument that is invalid. The argument itself could have true premises, but still have a false conclusion. Thus, a deductive fallacy is a fallacy where deduction goes wrong, and is no longer a logical process.
Logical fallacy.
The standard Aristotelian "logical fallacies" are:
Other logical fallacies include:
In philosophy, the term "logical fallacy" properly refers to a formal fallacy—a flaw in the structure of a deductive argument, which renders the argument invalid.
However, it is often used more generally in informal discourse to mean an argument that is problematic for any reason, and thus encompasses informal fallacies as well as formal fallacies—valid but unsound claims or poor non-deductive argumentation.
The presence of a formal fallacy in a deductive argument does not imply anything about the argument's premises or its conclusion (see fallacy fallacy). Both may actually be true, or even more probable as a result of the argument (e.g. appeal to authority), but the deductive argument is still invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises in the manner described. By extension, an argument can contain a formal fallacy even if the argument is not a deductive one; for instance an inductive argument that incorrectly applies principles of probability or causality can be said to commit a formal fallacy.
Example.
[[File:Logical fallacy.svg|thumb|250px|A Venn diagram illustrating a fallacy:
Statement 1: Most of the green is touching the red.<br>
Statement 2: Most of the red is touching the blue.<br>
Logical fallacy: Since most of the green is touching red, and most of the red is touching blue, most of the green must be touching blue. This, however, is a false statement.]]
In the strictest sense, a logical fallacy is the incorrect application of a valid logical principle or an application of a nonexistent principle:
This is fallacious. And so is this:
Indeed, there is no logical principle that states:
An easy way to show the above inference as invalid is by using Venn diagrams. In logical parlance, the inference is invalid, since under at least one interpretation of the predicates it is not validity preserving.
People often have difficulty applying the rules of logic. For example, a person may say the following syllogism is valid, when in fact it is not:
"That creature" may well be a bird, but the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Certain other animals also have beaks, for example, an octopus has a beak. Errors of this type occur because people reverse a premise. In this case, "All birds have beaks" is converted to "All beaked animals are birds." The reversed premise is plausible because few people are aware of any instances of "beaked creature" besides birds—but this premise is not the one that was given. In this way, the deductive fallacy is formed by points that may individually appear logical, but when placed together are shown to be incorrect.

The Age of Stupid

The Age of Stupid is a 2009 British film by Franny Armstrong, director of "McLibel" and "Drowned Out", and founder of , and first-time producer Lizzie Gillett. The Executive Producer is John Battsek, producer of "One Day in September".
The film is a drama-documentary-animation hybrid which stars Pete Postlethwaite as a man living alone in the devastated world of 2055, watching archive footage from the mid-to-late 2000s and asking "Why didn't we stop climate change when we had the chance?"
The makers of "The Age of Stupid" were among the first to use the crowdfunding model and pioneered a new distribution system, Indie Screenings, which allows anyone, anywhere, to hold a screening of the film and keep the profits for themselves.
Plot.
The film begins in the year 2055 in a world ravaged by catastrophic climate change; London is flooded, Sydney is burning, Las Vegas has been swallowed up by desert, the Amazon rainforest has burnt up, snow has vanished from the Alps and nuclear war has laid waste to India. An unnamed archivist (Pete Postlethwaite) is entrusted with the safekeeping of humanity's surviving store of art and knowledge. Alone in his vast repository off the coast of the largely ice-free Arctic, he reviews archive footage from back "when we could have saved ourselves", trying to discern where it all went wrong.
Amid news reports of the gathering effects of climate change and global civilization teetering towards destruction, he alights on six stories of individuals whose lives in the early years of the 21st century seem to illustrate aspects of the impending catastrophe. These six stories take the form of interweaving documentary segments that report on the lives of real people around the year 2008, and switch the film's narrative form from fiction to fact. In addition to the framing narrative in 2055, the news clips and the documentary footage of the six personal stories, the films includes animated segments and brief interviews with Mark Lynas and George Monbiot, created for the film.
Release.
The film's UK premiere was on 15 March 2009 in London's Leicester Square. The screening was held in a solar-powered ‘cinema tent’ and conducted without use of mains
electricity. An independent audit conducted by Carbon Accounting Systems found the event's carbon emissions to be 1% of those produced by a normal blockbuster premiere. Linked by satellite to 62 cinemas around the UK, the premiere received a Guinness World Record for being the largest film premiere ever, based on number of screens.
During the post show discussion, President Mohamed Nasheed received a standing ovation for announcing that the Maldives would be the world's first carbon neutral country. Star of the film Pete Postlethwaite threatened to return his OBE if the government gave the go-ahead to the controversial Kingsnorth coal-fired power station in Kent. A month later the Government announced a change to its policy on coal - no new coal-fired power station will get government consent unless it can capture and bury 25% of the emissions it produces immediately - and 100% of emissions by 2025. This, a source told the Guardian, represented “a complete rewrite of UK energy policy”.
The UK premiere received the accolades of ‘Best Green Event’ from Event Awards and best Live Brand Experience in the PR Week Awards.
In the UK, "The Age of Stupid" was released in 62 cinemas in its opening week and hit the top of the Box Office charts (by screen average). The total run was 13 consecutive weeks, playing in 263 cinemas in all, with the longest single run being four weeks at London's Odeon Panton Street.
"The Age of Stupid" was launched in Australia and New Zealand on 19 August 2009 with simultaneous green carpet premieres in Auckland and Sydney, linked by satellite to 32 cinemas in Australia and 13 in New Zealand. The film was then released in all 13 cinemas in New Zealand and many of the 32 in Australia.
The film was released internationally on 21 September and 22 September 2009 at the "Global Premiere". A green carpet cinema tent in downtown New York, powered by locally sourced biodiesel, was linked by satellite to 442 cinemas across the USA and to more than 200 cinemas in more than 30 other countries, as well as another 33 countries which hosted independent screenings with no satellite link. Popular musicians Moby and Thom Yorke from Radiohead performed live. Special guests at the New York premier included Kofi Annan, Ed Miliband, Mohamed Nasheed, Rajendra Pachauri, Heather Graham, and Gillian Anderson. Pranksters, The Yes Men, walked up the green carpet in their “survivaballs”. Many guests arrived by low-carbon transport, including sailboat, rowing boat, electric car, bicycle, bicycle rickshaw and rollerblades.
In Germany, the film was premiered in Berlin and Hamburg on 1 June 2010, followed by a limited cinema release in twelve cities: Berlin, Hamburg, München, Nürnberg, Bonn, Frankfurt, Potsdam, Gütersloh, Freiberg, Göttingen, Bremen, Hannover and Köln.
The film had limited theatrical releases via distributors Mongrel Media in Canada and via Arts Alliance in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, Micronesia, Moldova, Mozambique, Nepal, Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Palestinian Territories, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Vietnam and Zimbabwe.
The film continues to be shown in local venues worldwide through Indie Screenings - a web-based form of film distribution, pioneered by Franny Armstrong, Age of Stupid’s Director, which allows anyone to buy a license to hold a screening of the film, keeping the profits for themselves.
Reception.
Writing for "The Guardian", environmental activist George Monbiot, who appears in the film, said its "message, never stated but constantly emerging, is that we all have our self-justifying myths. We tell ourselves a story of our lives in which we almost always appear as the heroes. These myths prevent us from engaging with climate change." The Financial Times critic described the film as intelligent and provoking, giving “The wisdom of hindsight, today”.
"Time Out London's" film editor, Dave Calhoun, said, "Armstrong's prognosis is apocalyptic, but her journalism is solid, instructive and pleasingly thoughtful," and described the film as "entertaining and provocative".
"The Times" called the film "the most imaginative and dramatic assault on the institutional complacency shrouding the issue", saying, "The power of this shameless campaigning film is that it gives dates and deadlines. It explores options and ideas. It names culprits..."
"The Telegraph's" reviewer, Sukhdev Sandhu, said, "Bold, supremely provocative, and hugely important, [Armstrong's] film is a cry from the heart as much as a roar for necessary change."
Based on only 12 reviews Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 73%. "The New York Times" described the film as a "much sterner and more alarming polemic than "An Inconvenient Truth"". The review noted the "gallows humor" throughout the film, although the review was critical of the crude animated sequences.
"The Sydney Morning Herald" described the film as "a wake-up call with an elegiac tone — not quite hectoring but pressing. This is about human nature, greed and personal responsibility. It aims to scare and galvanize — and it's pretty good at both." In a double-page spread under the headline “Oblivious to oblivion” "The Sun"'s environment editor said "reality has caught up with the apocalyptic images."
William Nicholson, writer of Shadowlands and Gladiator, said “I hate this film. I felt as if I was watching all my own excuses for not doing anything about climate change being stripped away from me.”
Background.
Shot in seven countries over a period of three years, the film features six separate documentary stories, archive footage and lots of animation from, amongst others, Passion Pictures, creators of the Gorillaz animations. The original rough cut did not include the archivist which was added later to frame the story and better tie together the six parts.
Crowd funding.
Franny Armstrong adopted a new model to fund the production of The Age of Stupid. Now popular with independent film makers, crowdfunding involves the pooling of money and other resources to support efforts initiated by other people or organizations. The film was "crowd-funded", with the £450,000 budget being raised by selling "shares" to 223 individuals and groups who donated between £500 and £35,000. These groups range from a hockey team to a health centre. This was mostly to give it the best chance of reaching a mainstream multiplex audience, but also to retain complete editorial control. These investors all own a percentage of the film and have received a pro-rata share in the profits, alongside the 105 crew who worked for survival wages.
In the Huffington Post, Jon Reiss described Armstrong’s approach as trailblazing: “the future of film, film culture and film distribution and marketing”.
Production.
In a 55 minute documentary, "The Making of The Age of Stupid" 'Team Stupid' reveal the lengths to which they went to make the film.
Carbon footprint.
The producers calculated the carbon footprint of the film's production to be around 95 tonnes of CO2, and its promotion around 57 tonnes.
Distribution.
On 22 May 2009, "The Age of Stupid" team launched their Indie Screenings model, a new form of film distribution which allows anyone, anywhere to buy a license to hold a screening of the film - with the price set according to the screener's means - and then, crucially, to charge for tickets and keep any profits for themselves. The launch on 22 May was held at The RSA, following which there was a webcast panel discussion with director Franny Armstrong, journalist George Monbiot, economist Nicholas Stern, and the Met Office head of climate impacts Richard Betts. The panel discussion was around the country watched at 71 local screenings which had been organised through the Indie Screenings system.
The Indie Screenings model immediately proved extremely popular, with 682 screenings booked in the first four months, generating more than £55,000. After the cost of writing the software was paid off, 100% of the proceeds goes to pay back the crowd-funding investors. There were no wholesalers or resellers.
Music.
The soundtrack includes songs from Radiohead, Depeche Mode, Dragnerve and The Band of Holy Joy, as well as an original orchestral score written by Chris Brierley.
"The Stupid Show".
To help demystify the geo-political intricacies surrounding climate change, "The Age of Stupid" team staged a guerrilla production from the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference (7 December to 18 December 2009), called "The Stupid Show". Franny Armstrong hosted the run of eight 40-60 minute shows which were broadcast live on the web daily from Friday 11 December until the final day of the conference, Saturday 19 December. Armstrong has described "The Stupid Show" as 'a budget version of "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" but much sillier and more interactive'.
"The Stupid Show" aimed to make the Copenhagen talks comprehensible to ordinary people using a mix of humour, stunts, video clips, graphic illustrations and interviews with delegates, climate change experts and activists billeted in the Danish capital Copenhagen for the summit. Highlights from the run included punditry from Radiohead singer Thom Yorke, an interview with author Naomi Klein, an interview with Ed Miliband conducted by Franny Armstrong whilst standing on her head, and a live link-up to an underwater camera in Belize which showed how climate change is devastating coral reefs. The production team consisted of nine people, all of whom worked with Armstrong on "The Age of Stupid". Key members of The Stupid Show crew include producer Lizzie Gillett, writer Mark Lynas and editor Justin Badger.
10:10.
An offshoot of "The Age of Stupid" project is , a UK-wide campaign encouraging everyone in the United Kingdom to reduce their carbon emissions by at least 10% in twelve months. Franny Armstrong conceived the 10:10 campaign to complement the ongoing promotion of her film: while "The Age of Stupid" is primarily aimed at raising awareness of climate change as a pending global humanitarian crisis, 10:10 is presented as a strategy for people to take positive action in the face of such an urgent and daunting problem.

Partial molar property

A partial molar property is a thermodynamic quantity which indicates how an extensive property of a solution or mixture varies with changes in the molar composition of the mixture at constant temperature and pressure. Essentially it is the partial derivative with respect to the quantity (number of moles) of the component of interest. Every extensive property of a mixture has a corresponding partial molar property. 
Definition.
The partial molar volume is broadly understood as the contribution that a component of a mixture makes to the overall volume of the solution. However, there is rather more to it than this:
When one mole of water is added to a large volume of water at 25 ºC, the volume increases by 18 cm3. The molar volume of pure water would thus be reported as 18 cm3 mol-1. However, addition of one mole of water to a large volume of pure ethanol results in an increase in volume of only 14 cm3. The reason that the increase is different is that the volume occupied by a given number of water molecules depends upon the identity of the surrounding molecules. The value 14 cm3 is said to be the partial molar volume of water in ethanol.
In general, the partial molar volume of a substance X in a mixture is the change in volume per mole of X added to the mixture.
The partial molar volumes of the components of a mixture vary with the composition of the mixture, because the environment of the molecules in the mixture changes with the composition. It is the changing molecular environment (and the consequent alteration of the interactions between molecules) that results in the thermodynamic properties of a mixture changing as its composition is altered
If, by formula_1, one denotes a generic extensive property of a mixture, it will always be true that it depends on the pressure (formula_2), temperature (formula_3), and the amount of each component of the mixture (measured in moles, "n"). For a mixture with "m" components, this is expressed as
Now if temperature "T" and pressure "P" are held constant, formula_5 is a homogeneous function of degree 1, since doubling the quantities of each component in the mixture will double formula_1. More generally, for any formula_7:
By Euler's first theorem for homogeneous functions, this implies
where formula_10 is the partial molar formula_1 of component formula_12 defined as:
By Euler's second theorem for homogeneous functions, formula_10 is a homogeneous function of degree 0 which means that for any formula_15:
In particular, taking formula_17 where formula_18, one has
where formula_20 is the concentration, or mole fraction of component formula_12.
Since the molar fractions satisfy the relation
the "xi" are not independent, and the partial molar property is a function of only formula_23 mole fractions:
The partial molar property is thus an intensive property - it does not depend on the size of the system.
Applications.
Partial molar properties are useful because chemical mixtures are often maintained at constant temperature and pressure and under these conditions, the value of any extensive property can be obtained from its partial molar property. They are especially useful when considering specific properties of pure substances (that is, properties of one mole of pure substance) and properties of mixing. By definition, properties of mixing are related to those of the pure substance by:
Here formula_26 denotes the pure substance, formula_27 the mixing property, and formula_28 corresponds to the specific property under consideration. From the definition of partial molar properties,
substitution yields:
So from knowledge of the partial molar properties, deviation of properties of mixing from single components can be calculated.
Relationship to thermodynamic potentials.
Partial molar properties satisfy relations analogous to those of the extensive properties. For the internal energy "U", enthalpy "H", Helmholtz free energy "A", and Gibbs free energy "G", the following hold:
where formula_2 is the pressure, formula_35 the volume, formula_3 the temperature, and formula_37 the entropy.
Differential form of the thermodynamic potentials.
The thermodynamic potentials also satisfy 
where formula_42 is the chemical potential defined as (for constant nj with j≠i):
This last partial derivative is the same as formula_44, the partial molar Gibbs free energy. This means that the partial molar Gibbs free energy and the chemical potential, one of the most important properties in thermodynamics and chemistry, are the same quantity. Under isobaric (constant "P") and isothermal (constant "T ") conditions, knowledge of the chemical potentials, formula_45, yields every property of the mixture as they completely determine the Gibbs free energy.
Calculating partial molar properties.
To calculate the partial molar property formula_46 of a binary solution, one begins with the pure component denoted as formula_47 and, keeping the temperature and pressure constant during the entire process, add small quantities of component formula_48; measuring formula_1 after each addition. After sampling the compositions of interest one can fit a curve to the experimental data. This function will be formula_50.
Differentiating with respect to formula_51 will give formula_46.
formula_53 is then obtained from the relation:

China P. Arnold

China Arnold (born March 29, 1980, in Dayton, Ohio) is an American convicted murderer.
Case.
Arnold, who had been convicted of abduction in 2000 and forgery in 2002, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on 8 September 2008 for killing her 28-day-old daughter, Paris. The infant was placed in a microwave oven for what analysts suspect was longer than 2 minutes and died shortly after removal. Death occurred because her internal temperature reached critical temperatures. In the words of medical examiner, Dr. Marcella Fierro, "she was cooked." 
At the time, Arnold lived with her children and her boyfriend, Terrell Talley, in a housing complex. Prosecutors said that she placed Paris into the microwave after an argument with Talley over the baby's paternity; she told investigators that she was intoxicated. Arnold took Paris to the hospital the next day, where she died of her injuries. Arnold was arrested initially, then released due to lack of evidence. She was re-arrested in November 2006. 
Shortly after Arnold's first trial began, Talley told the "Dayton Daily News" that his son told him that he pulled the baby's lifeless body out of the microwave after a neighbor's boy had put her in there; the claim resulted in a mistrial. However, at the second trial, the mother of the boy in question established that he was not at the housing complex when Paris died, and Arnold was convicted of aggravated murder. 
On 5 November 2010, the Second District Court of Appeals reversed Arnold's conviction, citing misconduct by prosecutors and that the court erred by not allowing material witnesses to testify in Arnold's defense. 
On 13 May 2011, a jury found Arnold guilty of aggravated murder. Her attorney had argued that the evidence pointed as much to Talley as it did Arnold, to no avail. 
Aftermath.
Arnold has been incarcerated at the Ohio Reformatory for Women since 11 September 2008.
On May 20, 2011, Arnold was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Her attorney says they will appeal the decision.

Yiohan

The Yiohan was the name of a ship involved in human trafficking. It made its way to the coast of Sicily, on the night of December 25, 1996 (Christmas Eve), carrying illegal immigrants from Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan. Its drunken captain Yusuf Al Halal forced over 300 immigrants at gun-point onto another smaller ship. Survivors claim that he deliberately steered & rammed the huger Yiohan metal ship onto the smaller wooden ship, thereby causing the deaths of 283 people. He was charged with murder, as he didn't even bother to save the lives of people who were drowning in water. But the charges against him were dropped due to a technical issue, the accident happened 19 miles away from the Sicilian coast in international waters and didn't fall under Italian jurisdiction. The incident was downplayed and denied for very long until 2001, when a fisherman found an ID card of a drowned Sri Lankan victim and contacted a journalist of "La Repubblica" newspaper in Rome.

Seisho Maru

Seisho Maru (, "Seishō Maru" ) was a cargo ship for Mitsui Bussan Kaisho in military service that was sunk by an American submarine during World War II. The ship had been built as SS "West Caruth", a cargo ship for the shortly after the end of World War I. Shortly after completion, the ship was inspected by the United States Navy for possible use as USS "West Caruth" (ID-2850) but was neither taken into the Navy nor ever commissioned under that name. Before being sold to Japanese owners in 1928, she was also known as SS "Exmoor" and SS "Antonio Tripcovich".
"West Caruth" was built in 1918 for the , as a part of the "West" boats, a series of steel-hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort, and was the second ship built at Southwestern Shipbuilding in San Pedro, California. After operating for four years under American registry, she was sold several times and operated under British, Italian, and Japanese registry throughout the remainder of her career. In November 1944, while serving as Japanese transport "Seisho Maru" during World War II, she was sunk by U.S. Navy submarine .
Design and construction.
The "West" ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the for emergency use during World War I. All were given names that began with the word "West", like "West Caruth", the second of some 18 "West" ships built by the Southwestern Shipbuilding of San Pedro, California. "West Caruth" (Southwestern Shipbuilding No. 2) was launched at 08:00 on 31 December 1918 by sponsor Betty Howard, the nine-year-old daughter of company vice president, William F. Howard, and completed in February 1919.
"West Caruth" was , and was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam. The ship had a single triple-expansion steam engine that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to .
Career.
"West Caruth" was inspected by the 12th Naval District of the United States Navy after completion for possible use as a service collier and was assigned the identification number of 3850. Had she been commissioned, she would have been known as USS "West Caruth" (ID-3850), but the Navy neither took over the ship nor commissioned her.
The cargo ship sailed for the under American registry for the first four years of her existence, and sailed to the west African ports of Dakar and Monrovia through 1921. The "Los Angeles Times" reported that "West Caruth" sailed out of Los Angeles in both transpacific and European–Pacific service for two years.
In 1923, "West Caruth" was sold to the North Devon Steamship Company and operated as tramp steamer "Exmoor" under the British flag. In 1924, she was purchased by the Tripcovich Shipping Company of Trieste and sailed under the Italian flag as "Antonio Tripcovich". Four years later, she was renamed "Seisho Maru" as a part of Oguma Shoten Gomei Kaisha of Tsurumi under Japanese registry. By the early 1930s "Seisho Maru" had been sold to Mitsui Bussan Kaisho.
There is scant record of the ship's movements under any of her later names. The "Los Angeles Times" reports her arrival at West Coast ports as "Seisho Maru" at least twice. In March 1930, the ship arrived at Tacoma, Washington, from Singapore to pick up a load of logs for export. Another notice in November 1933 noted her impending return to Los Angeles, where she was scheduled to take on a load of borax and scrap brass. In early May 1939, "Seisho Maru" ran aground in Tokyo Bay, but was refloated after several days.
During World War II, "Seisho Maru" served as an army transport, but sources reporting her movements are incomplete. It is known that she was one of some 20 ships that departed Takau as part of three combined convoys—TASA-17, TE-03, and No. 82—in mid-April 1944.
"Seisho Maru" and seven other ships formed convoy MI-27 which departed Moji for Miri, Borneo, on 15 November that same year. Escorted by a converted minesweeper and three smaller vessels, the convoy hugged the coast of the Korean peninsula to try to avoid American submarines. Nevertheless, a group of three submarines—, , and —found and attacked the convoy on the night of 17/18 November. Torpedoes from "Sunfish" sank "Edogawa Maru" and damaged "Seisho Maru" shortly after 22:00, while "Peto" sank "Osakasan Maru" at 23:40. At 01:30, the damaged "Seisho Maru" engaged in a gun battle with a surfaced submarine. Then, at 03:17, another spread of torpedoes from "Sunfish" finished off "Seisho Maru", which sank at position in the East China Sea.

Brouwer–Hilbert controversy

In a foundational controversy in twentieth-century mathematics, L. E. J. Brouwer, a supporter of intuitionism, opposed David Hilbert, the founder of formalism.
Background.
The background for the controversy was set with David Hilbert's axiomatization of geometry in the late 1890s. In his biography of Kurt Gödel, John W. Dawson, Jr summarizes the result as follows:
Dawson observes that "partisans of three principal philosophical positions took part in the debate" ("ibid.") – the logicists (Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell), the formalists (David Hilbert and his "school" of collaborators), and the constructivists (Henri Poincaré and Hermann Weyl); within this constructivist school was the radical self-named "intuitionist" L.E.J. Brouwer.
The following sections will expand these disputes noted by Dawson.
Brief history of Brouwer and Intuitionism.
Brouwer in effect founded the mathematical philosophy of intuitionism as a challenge to the then-prevailing formalism of David Hilbert and his collaborators Paul Bernays, Wilhelm Ackermann, John von Neumann and others (cf. Kleene (1952), pp. 46–59). As a variety of constructive mathematics, intuitionism is essentially a philosophy of the foundations of mathematics. It is sometimes and rather simplistically characterized by saying that its adherents refuse to use the law of excluded middle in mathematical reasoning.
In 1908:
"After completing his dissertation (1907: see Van Dalen), Brouwer made a conscious decision temporarily to keep his contentious ideas under wraps and to concentrate on demonstrating his mathematical prowess" (Davis (2000), p. 95); by 1910 he had published a number of important papers, in particular the Fixed Point Theorem. Hilbert – the formalist with whom the intuitionist Brouwer would ultimately spend years in conflict – admired the young man and helped him receive a regular academic appointment (1912) at the University of Amsterdam (Davis, p. 96). It was then that "Brouwer felt free to return to his revolutionary project which he was now calling "intuitionism" " ("ibid.").
In the later 1920s, Brouwer became involved in a public and demeaning controversy with Hilbert over editorial policy at "Mathematische Annalen", at that time a leading learned journal. He became relatively isolated; the development of intuitionism at its source was taken up by his student Arend Heyting.
Origins of disagreement.
The nature of Hilbert's proof of the Hilbert basis theorem (dating from 1888) turned out to be more controversial than Hilbert could have imagined at the time. Although Kronecker had conceded, Hilbert would later respond to others' similar criticisms that "many different constructions are subsumed under one fundamental idea" — in other words (to quote Reid):
Not all were convinced. While Kronecker would die soon after, his constructivist banner would be carried forward by sharp criticism from Poincaré, and later in full cry by the young Brouwer and his developing intuitionist "school"—Weyl in particular, much to Hilbert's torment in his later years (Reid 1996, pp. 148–149). Indeed, Hilbert lost his "gifted pupil" Weyl to intuitionism:
Brouwer the intuitionist in particular objected to the use of the Law of Excluded Middle over infinite sets (as Hilbert had indeed used it). Hilbert would respond:
Validity of the law of excluded middle.
In the same paper – the text of an address delivered in 1927 ("cf." van Heijenoort: Hilbert (1927)) – Hilbert clearly expresses himself. At first he attempts to defend his axiomatic system as having "important general philosophical significance" (van Heijenoort: Hilbert 1927 p. 475). For him, the statement of "definite rules" expresses "the technique of our thinking". Nothing is hidden, no tacit assumptions are admitted: "after all, it is part of the task of science to liberate us from arbitrariness, sentiment and habit, and to protect us from the subjectivism that ... finds its culmination in intuitionism". ("ibid.").
But then Hilbert gets to the nub of it – the proscription of the law of excluded middle (LoEM):
To doubt the LoEM—when extended over the completed infinite—was to doubt Hilbert's axiomatic system, in particular his "logical ε-axiom". To take away the LoEM was to destroy the "science of mathematics". Finally, Hilbert singles out one man—by inference, not by name—for the cause of his present tribulation:
Brouwer answers pique with pique:
Deeper philosophic differences.
A philosophical defeat in the quest for "truth" in the choice of axioms.
However "truth" is ultimately defined, for a few mathematicians Hilbert's formalism seemed to eschew the notion. And at least with respect to his choice of axioms the case can be made that indeed he "does" eschew the notion. The fundamental issue is just "how" does one choose "the axioms"? Until Hilbert proposed his formalism, the axioms were chosen on an "intuitive" (experiential) basis. Aristotelian logic is a good example – based on one's life-experiences it just seems "logical" that an object of discourse either has a stated property (e.g. "This truck is yellow") or it does not have that property ("This truck is not yellow") but not both simultaneously (the Aristotelian Law of Excluded Middle). The primitive form of the induction axiom is another – if a predicate P(n) is true for n = 0 and if for all natural numbers n it is true that P(n) => P(n+1), then P(n) is true for all natural numbers n.
Hilbert's axiomatic system – his formalism – is different. At the outset it declares its axioms. But he doesn't require the selection of these axioms to be based upon either "common sense", a priori knowledge (intuitively derived understanding or awareness, innate knowledge seen as "truth without requiring any proof from experience" ), or observational experience (empirical data). Rather, the mathematician in the same manner as the theoretical physicist is free to adopt any (arbitrary, abstract) collection of axioms that they so choose. Indeed Weyl asserts that Hilbert had "formalizit [classical mathematics, thus transforming it in principle from a system of intuitive results into a game with formulas that proceeds according to fixed rules" ("loc. cit." p. 483). So, Weyl asks, what might guide the choice of these rules? "What impels us to take as a basis precisely the particular axiom system developed by Hilbert?" ("ibid."). Weyl offers up "consistency is indeed a necessary but not sufficient condition" but he cannot answer more completely except to note that Hilbert's "construction" is "arbitrary and bold" ("ibid."). Finally he notes, in italics, that the "philosophical result" of Hilbert's "construction" will be the following:
In other words: the role of innate feelings and tendencies (intuition) and observational experience (empiricism) in the choice of axioms will be removed except in the global sense – the "construction" had better work when put to the test: "only the theoretical system as a whole ... can be confronted with experience" ("ibid.").
The Law of Excluded Middle extended to the infinite.
Cantor (1897) extended the intuitive notion of "the infinite" – one foot placed after the other in a never-ending march toward the horizon – to the notion of "a completed infinite" – the arrival "all the way, way out there" in one fell swoop, and he symbolized this notion with a single sign ℵ0 (aleph-null). Hilbert's adoption of the notion wholesale was "thoughtless", Brouwer believed. Brouwer in his (1927a) "Intuitionistic reflections on formalism" states:
This THIRD INSIGHT is referring to Hilbert's second problem and Hilbert's ongoing attempt to axiomatize all of arithmetic, and with this system, to discover a "consistency proof" for all of mathematics – see more below. So into this fray (started by Poincaré) Brouwer plunged head-long, with Weyl as back-up.
Their first complaint (Brouwer's SECOND INSIGHT, above) arose from Hilbert's extension of Aristotle's "Law of Excluded Middle" (and "double negation") – hitherto restricted to finite domains of Aristotelian discourse – to "infinite" domains of discourse". In the late 1890s Hilbert successfully axiomatized geometry. Then he went on to successfully (or so Hilbert thought) use the Cantorian-inspired notion of the completed infinity to produce elegant, radically abbreviated proofs in analysis (1896 and afterwards). In his own words of defense Hilbert believed himself quite justified in what he had done (in the following he calls this type of proof an existence proof):
What Hilbert had to give up was "constructability" – his proofs would not produce "objects" (except for the proofs themselves – i.e. symbol strings), but rather they would produce contradictions of the premises and have to proceed by reductio ad absurdum extended over the infinite.
Hilbert's quest for a generalized proof of consistency of the axioms of arithmetic.
Brouwer viewed this loss of constructability as bad, but worse when applied to a generalized "proof of consistency" for all of mathematics. In his 1900 address Hilbert had specified, as the second of his 23 problems for the twentieth century, the quest for a generalized proof of (procedure for determining) the consistency of the axioms of arithmetic. Hilbert, unlike Brouwer, believed that the formalized notion of mathematical induction could be applied in the search for the "generalized" consistency proof.
A consequence of this marvelous proof/procedure P would be the following: Given any arbitrary mathematical theorem T (formula, procedure, proof) put to P (thus P(T)) "including P itself" (thus P(P)), P would determine conclusively whether or not the theorem T (and P) was "provable" – i.e. derivable from its premises, the axioms of arithmetic. Thus for all T, T would be "provable" by P or not "provable" by P and "under all conditions" (i.e. for any assignment of numerical values to T's variables). This is a perfect illustration of the use of the Law of Excluded Middle extended over the infinite, in fact extended "twice" – first over all theorems (formulas, procedures, proofs) and secondly for a given theorem, for all assignment of its variables. This point, missed by Hilbert, was first pointed out to him by Poincaré and later by Weyl in his 1927 comments on Hilbert's lecture:
In his discussion preceding Weyl's 1927 comments van Heijenoort explains that Hilbert insisted that he had addressed the issue of "whether a formula, taken as an axiom, leads to a contradiction, the question is whether a proof that leads to a contradiction can be presented to me" ("loc. cit.", p. 481).
If successful the quest would result in a remarkable outcome: Given such a generalized proof, all mathematics could be replaced by an automaton consisting of two parts: (i) a formula-generator to create formulas one after the other, followed by (ii) the generalized consistency proof, which would yield "Yes – valid (i.e. provable)" or "No – not valid (not provable)" for each formula submitted to it (and every possible assignment of numbers to its variables). In other words: mathematics would cease as a creative enterprise and become a machine.
The problem of the Law of Excluded Middle with respect to induction.
In van Heijenoort's commentary preceding Weyl's (1927) "Comments on Hilbert's second lecture on the foundations of mathematics" Poincaré points out to Hilbert (1905) that there are two types of "induction" (1) the intuitive animal-logic foot-following-foot version that gives us a sense that there's always another footstep after the last footstep, and (2) the formal version – e.g. Peano's version: a string of symbols. The gang of three – Poincaré, Weyl and Brouwer – claimed that Hilbert tacitly, and unjustifiably, adopted as one of his premises formal induction (the symbol string). Poincaré (1905) asserted that, by doing this, Hilbert's reasoning became circular. Weyl's (1927) agreement and Brouwer's polemics ultimately forced Hilbert and his disciples Herbrand, Bernays and Ackermann to reexamine their notion of "induction" – to eschew the assumption of a "totality of all the objects x of an infinite collection" and (intuitionistically) assume that the general argument proceeds one x after another, ad infinitum (van Heijenoort p. 481, footnote a). This is in fact the so-called "induction schema" used in the notion of "recursion" that was still in development at this time ("cf." van Heijenoort p. 493) – this schema was acceptable to the intuitionists because it had been derived from "the intuition".
To carry this distinction further, Kleene 1952/1977 distinguishes between three types of mathematical induction – (1) the formal Induction Rule (Peano's axiom, see the next section for an example), (2) the inductive definition (examples: counting, "Proof by induction"), and (3) the definition by induction (recursive definition of "number-theoretic functions or predicates). With regards to (3), Kleene considers primitive recursive functions:
Echoes of the controversy.
Brouwer's insistence on "constructibility" in the search for a "consistency proof for arithmetic" resulted in sensitivity to the issue as reflected by the work of Finsler and Gödel. Ultimately Gödel would "numeralize" his formulae; Gödel then used primitive recursion (and its instantiation of the intuitive, constructive form of induction – i.e. counting and step-by-step evaluation) rather than a string of symbols that represent formal induction. Gödel was so sensitive to this issue that he took great pains in his 1931 to point out that his Theorem VI (the so-called "First incompleteness theorem") "is constructive;45a, that is, the following has been proved in an intuitionistically unobjectionable manner ... ." He then demonstrates what he believes to be the constructive nature of his "generalization formula" 17 Gen r. Footnote 45a reinforces his point.
Gödel's 1931 does include the formalist's symbol-version of the Peano Induction Axiom; it looks like this, where "." is the logical AND, f is the successor-sign, x2 is a function, x1 is a variable, x1Π designates "for all values of variable x1":
But he does not appear to use this in the formalist's sense.
Note that there is contention around this point. Gödel specifies this symbol string in his I.3. (p. 600 in van Heijenoort), i.e. the formalized inductive axiom appears as shown above – yet even this string can be "numeralized" using Gödel's method. On the other hand, he doesn't appear to use this axiom. Rather, his recursion steps through integers assigned to variable k (cf his (2) on page 602). His skeleton-proof of Theorem V, however, "use(s) induction on the degree of φ", and uses "the induction hypothesis". Without a full proof of this, we are left to assume that his use of the "induction hypothesis" is the intuitive version, not the symbolic axiom. His recursion simply steps up the degree of the functions, an intuitive act, ad infinitum. But Nagel and Newman note that Gödel's proofs are "in"finitary in nature (cf Nagel and Newman p. 98), not finitary as Hilbert requested (see Hilbert's second problem) while Gödel insisted that they are intuitionistically satisfactory. These are not incompatible truths, as long as the LoEM over the infinite isn't invoked anywhere in the proofs.
Despite the last-half-twentieth century's continued abstraction of mathematics, the issue has not entirely gone away. Here are two examples. First, the premises of an argument – even ones considered beyond questioning – are always fair game. A hard look at the premises of Turing's 1936–7 led Robin Gandy (1980) to propose his "principles for mechanisms" that throw in the speed of light as a constraint. Secondly, Breger (2000) in his "Tacit Knowledge and Mathematical Progress" delves deeply into the matter of "semantics versus syntax" – in his paper Hilbert, Poincaré, Frege, and Weyl duly make their appearances. He examines a core problem: in axiomatic proofs the tacit assumption of an experienced, thinking mind: to be successful it must come to the argument equipped with prior knowledge of the symbols and their use (the semantics behind the mindless syntax): "Mathematics as a purely formal system of symbols without a human being possessing the know-how for dealing with the symbols is impossible to the chemist Polanyi (1969, 195), the ideal of a form of knowledge that is strictly explicit is contradictory because without tacit knowledge all formulas, words, and illustrations would become meaningless" (brackets in the original, Breger 2000:229).
Kleene on Brouwer–Hilbert.
A serious study of this foundational controversy can be found in Stephen Kleene's "Introduction to Metamathematics", particularly in Chapter III: A critique of mathematical reasoning. He discusses §11. "The paradoxes", §12. "First inferences from the paradoxes" definitions, Logicism etc., §13. "Intuitionism", §14. "Formalism", §15. "Formalization of a theory". Kleene takes the debate seriously, and throughout his book he actually builds the two "formal systems", e.g. on page 119 he shows those logical laws such as double negation that are disallowed in the intuitionist system.

Plazuelas

Plazuelas is a prehispanic archaeological site located just north of San Juan el Alto, some 2.7 kilometers (1.57 mi.) north of federal highway 90 (Pénjamo-Guadalajara), and about 11 kilometers (6.8 mi.) west of the city of Pénjamo in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. The site is open to the public; it is dominated by a large, rectangular plaza with several pyramidal structures and platforms, along with a massive ball court. To the north of the structures is a field of boulders with thousands of glyphs carved into them.
The original settlement was considerably larger, with a large, circular structure called El Cajete marking its eastern extent.
According to INAH, site remains and evidence confirms the influence of many cultures merging on this site, although it is not certainly known who constructed this city, INAH believes the hunter-gatherer Chichimecas inhabited the Bajio region at the end of the postclassical period, and that many other sedentary cultures lived here before, but these cultures are not mentioned nor identified.
Plazuelas (600-900 CE) is located in the same Municipality as the Barajas (archaeological site) (? – 1000 CE) and some 46 kilometers (28.6 mi.) west of Peralta (100 – 900 CE), and share similar settlement mesoamerican classical period, hence it is possible that these three cities shared constructors, inhabitants, religion, governments and traded as part of a common “Bajio Tradition”.
Very little is known about these societies inhabiting the Bajio Region, they are thought to have been members of hunter-gatherer, fishing Chichimec groups, it is now known that these places were trading confluence routes between central Mexico with northern and western Mesoamerica.
Over 1400 years ago, in addition to Plazuelas, there were other five known important cities in the region; San Bartolome (Tzchté), San Miguel Viejo, Tepozán, Loza Los Padres and Peralta (Mesoamerican site). Circular structures confirm the Tradition constant ancient relations with other civilizations. Circular structures are common across prehispanic Mesoamerica.
Background.
The area north of the Lerma River, is presumed to have been originally occupied by hunter-gatherer nomadic groups, the surrounding area city construction was probably made by late occupants. Characteristics indicate that these constructions were sedentary establishments. Lifestyles and social characteristics follow the Mesoamerican model. It is estimated that the site was abandoned around year 1000 CE.
In prehispanic times, the Bajio region saw the most human development due to the fertility of the soil and the presence of surface water for agriculture. The oldest group to inhabit the area are called the Chupícuarios, who dominated the center of the Bajío area and were active in between 800 BCE and 300 CE. Their largest city is now the site called Chupícuaro, and their influence was widespread being found in the modern states of Zacatecas, Querétaro, Colima, Nayarit, Hidalgo, State of Mexico, Michoacán and Guerrero. Chupícuaro cities were associated with the Toltec city of Tula and when this city fell, these agricultural cities of Guanajuato also went into decline. This and a prolonged drought cause these cities to be abandoned between the 10th and 11th centuries with only the Guamares left ethnically.
Then Chichimeca and other nomadic groups entered the area. These nomadic indigenous groups are generically referred to as Chichimeca, but in reality they were a variety of ethnicities such as the Guachichiles, Pames and Zacatecos. These groups were warriors, semi nomadic and did not practice significant agriculture, nor did they construct cities. Part of the state was also inhabited by the Otomi but they were mostly displaced or dominated by the P’urhépecha in the southwest and the Chichimeca in other parts. By the 16th century, most of Mesoamerica was dominated by either the Aztec or P'urhépecha empires, but Guanajuato was under the control of neither. It was on the northern border of the P’urhépecha empire with southern Guanajuato showing significant cultural influence in the southern valleys, and Aztecs had ventured into the area looking for minerals. However, most of the state was dominated by various Chichimeca tribes as part of what the Spanish would call the “Gran Chichimeca.” These Chichimeca were mostly nomadic with some scattered agricultural communities, mostly in the north.
Northern Mexico has been studied by Pedro Armillas (1964, 1969), Braniff (1989, 1994). More recent archaeological has been made by France, with research periods in 1998, 1999 and 2000.
Bajio Tradition.
Not too long ago, the Bajio Region and a good part of the Mexican central plateau were considered of little archaeological interest. Little was known of native regional societies, beyond the historical data describing an almost uninhabited area two centuries before the conquest.
Data from historical documents indicated that the prehispanic Bajio inhabitants were only Chichimeca, nomadic groups with appropriation economies and belligerents. By 1972, Beatriz Braniff began to explain the Bajio cultures and proposed the contours of a "marginal" region of Mesoamerica, located on the edges of the high cultured regions The apparent influence of large Mesoamerican cities, mainly Teotihuacan in regional development, also departed from the academic debate the possibility of identifying and explaining the specific role played by local societies in the Mesoamerican development.
During the last ten years, archaeological studies have had a major boost in Guanajuato, and several myths of the Bajio past became truth, have provided better founded explanations based on the prehispanic life in this geographic area.
Three aspects seem fundamental: a) the Bajio as an important part of the Mesoamerican universe was a trade communication region and a link between three the cultural areas proposed by Paul Kirchhoff (1967): Central, North and West Mexico; b) theories based on influences determination from major population centers, has now been replaced by understanding the interactions and bi-directional relationships, where the implications of local societies such as Peralta have barely been addressed but no doubt will continue to investigate; c) during the mesoamerican classical period, between 300 and 700 CE, the Bajio developed a notable agricultural population, with a social and political organization structure, in addition to its deep regional cultural roots, that has been identified as the Bajio tradition.
Chichimeca.
Chichimeca was the name that the Nahua peoples of Mexico generically applied to a wide range of semi-nomadic peoples who inhabited the north of modern-day Mexico and southwestern United States, and carried the same sense as the European term "barbarian". The name was adopted with a pejorative tone by the Spaniards when referring especially to the semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer peoples of northern Mexico. In modern times only one ethnic group is customarily referred to as Chichimecs, namely the Chichimeca Jonaz, although lately this usage is being changed for simply "Jonáz" or their own name for themselves ""Úza"".
The Chichimeca peoples were in fact many different groups with varying ethnic and linguistic affiliations. As the Spaniards worked towards consolidating the rule of New Spain over the Mexican indigenous peoples during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the "Chichimecan tribes" maintained a resistance. A number of ethnic groups of the region allied against the Spanish, and the following military colonization of northern Mexico has become known as the "Chichimeca Wars".
Many of the peoples called Chichimeca are virtually unknown today; few descriptions mention them and they seem to have been absorbed into mestizo culture or into other indigenous ethnic groups. For example, virtually nothing is known about the peoples referred to as "Guachichiles", "Caxcanes", "Zacatecos", "Tecuexes", or "Guamares". Others like the "Opata" or ""Eudeve"" are well described but extinct as a people.
Other "Chichimec" peoples maintain a separate identity into the present day, for example the "Otomies", "Chichimeca Jonaz", "Coras", "Huicholes", "Pames", "Yaquis", "Mayos", "O'odham" and the "Tepehuánes".
The first description of a modern objective ethnography of the peoples inhabiting "La Gran Chichimeca" was done by Norwegian naturalist and explorer Carl Sofus Lumholtz in 1890 when he traveled on mule through northwestern Mexico, meeting the indigenous peoples on friendly terms. With his descriptions of the rich and different cultures of the various "uncivilized" tribes, the picture of the uniform Chichimec barbarians was changed, although in Mexican Spanish the word "Chichimeca" remains connected to an image of "savagery".
The historian Paul Kirchhoff, in his work "The Hunting-Gathering People of North Mexico," described the Chichimecas as sharing a hunter-gatherer culture, based on the gathering of mesquite, agave, and tunas (the fruit of the nopal). While others also lived off of acorns, roots and seeds. In some areas, the Chichimecas cultivated maize and calabash. From the mesquite, the Chichimecas made white bread and wine. Many Chichimec tribes utilized the juice of the agave as a substitute for water when it was in short supply.
The Site.
The site was built over an artificial plateau, comprising a civic-religious complex and a ballgame court on the southern side. The structure complex known as Casas Tapadas comprises 4 buildings, a palace and a small altar bordered by a thick wall with a seating bench on the inside. There are several accesses, with a main access on the west side. A Large road leads to this entrance.
The place is believed to have worshiped gods representing water, earth, fire and wind. This worship is depicted in the architectonic manifestations, sculptures and ornamental articles found. Rays, clouds, serpents, snails and spirals are symbols represented in stone glyphs, and structures.
Plazuelas was built over three hill sides, divided by two ravines, overlooking a large valley to the south.
The eastern ravine has a water spring, considered the main water source, while western ravine, known as “Los Cuijes” only has seasonal rain water.
It can be said that the plateau where the site was constructed is surrounded by natural ravines in three sides (east, north and west), some deeper than others, the southern side, where the access to the site is located, is composed by a smooth slope towards the valley.
The esplanade to the west has remains of a second ballgame court, and possibly other remains, yet to be explored.
The central esplanade contains five buildings; it is believed to have represented the larger construction effort, in leveling the terrain. The buildings are the Casas Tapadas Complex, a ballgame court to the south, two structures just west of the court, a Temazcal and a large concentration of petroglyphs at the northern and western edges of the esplanade.
An interesting consideration is that the main three structures at Casas Tapadas, resemble three hills on the background and would seem to have been purposely aligned. See photograph.
The eastern esplanade has an unexplored circular basement.
The site structures seem to be aligned north south with a few degree deviation to the east.
Structures.
Casas Tapadas and the ballgame court to the south are connected by a 220 meter (720 ft.) long road 
The building decoration depicts the stylized motif of “atadura de años” (bundle of years), the design was modified in several occasions to commemorate the end of a life cycle. It is also depicted in ray shaped sculptures ornamenting the eastern pyramid.
Casas Tapadas.
The complex was built over a large rectangular platform oriented east-west, measuring approximately 132 by 89 meters (433 by 291 ft.) over which several structures were built, three main structures are aligned east - west.
The complex has a perimeter wall with a large walkway built into the interior facade, interrupted by seven entrances: three to the north, three to the south and one to the west.
The site contains a traditional Bajio element, known as a sunken patio, as it is located at a lower level within the complex.
The complex had several expansions, to the north by a square patio at the west side and to the south by a rectangular patio at the eastern end, communicated by a hall way parallel to the basement. This expansion communicates with the exterior by four stairways. To the south, because of the terrain level contour, the expansion forms a large terrace similar to the northern expansion, and on the center of the south side has a stairway that leads onto the road that connects with the ballgame court.
The north and south basements were modified three times, when originally built they had certain symmetry, with an overhang decoration over the wall sides, it became more complex on the second stage of the north basement, while on the south basement it was simpler; in both cases, a stone slab holds most of the ornament weight.
During the third constructive stage the building design changes completely, to the south, the building design is very basic, the walls has no ornaments, while the northern side the structure is conformed by large engraved self-supported stones, supporting the stone slabs weight.
The structure has rather rare elements in Guanajuato. The architectonic layout is T shaped and unfortunately was found in bad conditions; apparently was destroyed towards its decline (900 CE). The profile of its perimeter wall also has the northern structure monolithic stones and among the remains are large engraved stones depicting cut spirals that most have been part of the structure. Inside are traces of a wall that possibly divided the space, covered with a clay floor, probably remains of two small patios.
The main Access to Casas Tapadas is by a road limited by low walls on the western side. On the northern side there are several steps that indicate a straight line smooth route down towards the water spring.
Caracoles.
This structure is actually part of the Casas Tapadas complex, it is called “Caracoles”, because of spiral figures found as part of the structure ornament.
The building on the back contained carved stones with lightning representations and the year symbol, over a cane bundle. Possibly in memory of an important event or the beginning of a new 52 year cycle.
In addition to its political function, it was probably dedicated to the earth, by the inverted T shape related to the underworld. Its walls contain carved stones with a cut spiral.
Circular Basement.
Un unexplored circular basement with a 48 meter (157 ft.) diameter is located some 624 meters (2047 ft.) east of the Casas Tapadas complex, over the eastern ravine, it is believed to be somehow part of the Circular Building Tradition of Teuchitlán, Jalisco /> on the Guachimontones three pyramidal basements conforming an open plaza and subtle terraces.
Ballgame Court.
The structure is the first architectural element seen upon entering the site, with Casas Tapadas in the background to the north.
The structure has bigger constructions on the western side, while walls on the eastern side are lower, both sides possibly had stands for spectators attending the game.
The ballgame court is I shaped, measuring some 65 by 31 meters (213 by 101 ft.) 
It presumably had a religious sense, it is believed that the game purpose was to assure the victorious rising of the sun every morning, with renewed energy to provide life on earth.
In the four corners of the court were found sculptures representing a serpents and at the center, as marker a serpent –lizard.
These mythological serpent presentations were offerings at the ballgame courts and also share features of the rain god and lightning. The claws below and the headdress displayed towards the back, symbolizes the power of nature elements.
The marker found at the eastern side of the court, depicts attributes of the ancient rain gods, reiterating their association with fertility. This is expressed by the feather headdress, eye circles, the spiral depicting a mouth, the coiled nose, gums with teeth and the lower jaw.
Ballgame ceremonial structures.
These two square structures sit just west of the ballgame court, hence it is assume they were related to the game, probably with ceremonial purposes, following the ritual bath at the Temazcal structure, further to the west.
Notice the opposing steps into the structures; the structure on the south (left on the photograph) has protruding steps, while the structure to the right has recessed steps.
Temazcal.
To the west of the ballgame court (and ceremonial structures) is a Temazcal or ceremonial bath house, were players probably took purifying baths, before the ceremonial game.
Petroglyphs.
There are apparently two main zones with many petroglyphs, one to the east of the ball game, near the Temazcal and another more important section to the north.
The petroglyphs were engraved on the surface of igneous rock outgrowths, by natives, in high and low relief, holes, circles, dotted lines, continuous lines, spiral, concentric circles, zoomorphic figures, planes and isolated building models and complex sites.
The model outline Bajio architectonic elements, such as sunken patios and other features from gar away regions, such as Teuchitlán (Guachimontones), that confirms the multi-ethnicity hypothesis of these lands.
An important sample is the model, depicting details of the Casas Tapadas complex, the details of elements engraved such as accesses, stairways, walkways and structures architectonic lay out is remarkable.
Sculptures.
Among the relevant findings at the site, are several fragments of anthropomorphic stone sculptures that presumably were destroyed along with the site structures. These include a male figure, mutilated of hands, legs and head, seems to be a captive representation, its slim body, the back curvature and the arms are stiff up against its body, would indicate a person tied and captive, similar to others observed in other regions.
Phallus.
Was found at the main entrance of casas tapadas, it was broken in for pieces. It is believed that it was vertically set originally. This is a male attribute marker to the site, representing fertility. It has many carvings, similar to others found in the site.
Turquoise.
It was a high valued stone for jewels manufacturing, it was associated with water and the morning sky. Many pieces were found with various designs, among them are miniature figures (measuring about 3 mm or 1/8 of an inch), shaped as water droplets, lightning and dogs, animals associated with water.
Site Museum.
Upon entering the site, the Museum is on the right hand side, it contains a large number of pieces found in the site.
Site facilities are well kept, including parking space, toilets, souvenirs and a well-marked site visit route. The museum offers guided tours, by trained junior high schools children.

Kan-on

They were borrowed from the Tang Dynasty during the 7th to 9th century, introduced by, among others, envoys from Japanese missions to Tang China. This period corresponds with the Japanese Nara period. Not to be confused with Tō-on which literally translates as "Tang sound" but refers to later phonetic loans.
"Kan-on" is based on the central Chang'an pronunciation. The name "Kan" ("Han" in Chinese) could refer to the Han Dynasty, which also had Chang'an as its capital. Farthermore "Kan" has also become a description for all things Chinese, e.g., Kanji ('Chinese characters').
It partly displaced the earlier "go'on", which were "just imitations of Korean imitations, but "Kan-on" were imitations of the real things."
A minority of characters never had their "Kan-on" transmitted to Japan, their "Kan-on" are sometimes reconstructed in Japanese dictionaries, although they are usually not specifically marked as such. Sometimes actually attested "Kan-on" might even be discarded in favour of more systematic pronunciations in dictionaries.

Catalysis software design method

Catalysis is a software design method for the specification and design of component-based computer systems originally developed by Desmond D’Souza and Alan Cameron Wills in their 1999 book. 
Catalysis focuses on how to make precise abstractions, and emphasizes the formal specification of use cases using pre- and postconditions and ‘guarantees’ clauses. It also places stress on the specification of collaboration protocols so that kits of components can interact in a coherent ‘pluggable’ fashion. This removes much of the need to build translation or ‘mapping’ code. 
Catalysis therefore enhances the Unified Modelling Language (UML) with a definite method, showing how the various UML diagrams relate to each other and offering many design heuristics and process and design patterns. Catalysis builds on the Syntropy method and key ideas from both influenced the development of UML 2.0.
More recently, building on the work of D’Souza, Wills and that of John Cheesman and John Daniels, Derek Andrews of consultancy Trireme International has developed Catalysis II, which extends Catalysis to address the key issues of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Also building on the same foundation, Ian Graham developed Catalysis Conversation Analysis, a method of business process modelling with its roots in Semiotics and the idea of a use case ("cf". Graham, 2008).

Venetian People's Unity

The Venetian People's Unity ("Unitá Popołare Veneta", UPV) is a Venetist socialist and separatist political party.
Founded in 2008, the party seeks to represent the "Venetian left" and takes example from Herri Batasuna. According to its website, the party's goal is to create a "sythesis between socialist ideals, the defense of Venetian national identity and the fight for the self-determination of Venetian lands": in this respect, the UPV seeks to "spread Venetism within the left-wing and the left-wing within Venetism, in order to form a Venetian independentist and identitarian left".
In November 2009 the UPV joined other separatist parties, including the more mainstream Liga Veneta Repubblica and grassroots Venetians Movement, to form Veneto Freedom. However, as soon as in January 2010, the coalition was disbanded and its independentist core formed a more coherent outfit, the Party of the Venetians (PdV). In September 2010 the PdV was merged into Veneto State, but the UPV retained its identity within the new party.
In January 2012 the UPV endorsed the faction of Veneto State led by Antonio Guadagnini. Riccardo Lovato, the UPV spokesperson, addressed the party's congress and proposed a coalition between the two parties.

Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four

Oceania, Eurasia and Eastris are the three fictional superstates in George Orwell's futuristic dystopian novel "Nineteen Eighty-Four".
In the novel, the boundaries of these three powers are described, via a quote from chapter 3 of Goldstein's Book,
History.
The history of how the world evolved into these three states is vague. They appear to have emerged from nuclear warfare and civil dissolution over a twenty year period between 1945 (the end of the Second World War) and 1965. Eurasia was likely formed first, followed closely afterwards by Oceania with Eastasia emerging a decade later.
Oceania.
Oceania is the location of the novel's version of London, where Winston Smith, the main character, lives. It is apparently composed of the Americas, the British Isles (called "Airstrip One" in the novel), Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa below the River Congo. It also controls—to different degrees and at various times during the course of its eternal war with either Eurasia or Eastasia—the polar regions, India, Indonesia and the islands of the Pacific. Oceania lacks a single capital city, although what could be seen as regional capitals, such as London and apparently New York City, are in place. In the novel, Emmanuel Goldstein, Oceania's declared Public Enemy Number One, describes it in the fictional book "The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism" as a result of when the United States absorbed the British Empire. Goldstein's book also states that Oceania's primary natural defence is the sea surrounding it. This may be the reason why the Party highlights the Floating Fortresses.
The ruling doctrine of Oceania is Ingsoc, the Newspeak term for English Socialism, which is ultimately devoted to the naked exercise of power. Its nominal leader is Big Brother, who is believed by the masses to have been the leader of the revolution and is still used as a figurehead by the party, but may now be dead, or may have never existed. The personality cult is maintained through Big Brother's function as a focal point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which are more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organisation.
The unofficial language of Oceania is English (officially Oldspeak) and the official language is Newspeak. The restructuring of the language is intended to ultimately eliminate even the possibility of unorthodox political and social thought, by eliminating the words needed to express it.
The society of Oceania is sharply stratified into three groups: the small power-seeking and government controlling Inner Party, the more numerous and highly indoctrinated Outer Party, and the large body of politically meaningless and mindless Proles. Except for certain rare exceptions like Hate Week, the proles remain essentially outside Oceania's political control and are kept placated by distractions such as trivial sports and entertainment; the Thought Police easily manage any Prole socially aware enough to be a problem. 
Oceania's national anthem is "Oceania, Tis For Thee" which, in one of the three film versions of the book, takes the form of a crescendo of organ music along with operatic lyrics. The lyrics are sung in English, and the song is reminiscent of "God Save the Queen" and "Die Stem van Suid-Afrika".
Airstrip One.
Airstrip One, a province of Oceania, acts as the primary setting. It is located in what "had been called England or Britain", and is the home of the main characters of the book, including its protagonist, Winston Smith.
Even the names of countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip One, for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called England, or Britain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always been called London.
Like Europe as a whole, Britain was hit with some number of atomic weapons in the devastating conflicts that came before the revolutions in Oceania and then elsewhere. One British town, Colchester, is referenced specifically as having been destroyed; flashbacks to Smith's childhood also include scenes of Londoners taking refuge in the city's underground transit tunnels in the midst of the bombing.
Eurasia.
It is stated that Eurasia was formed when the Soviet Union annexed the rest of continental Europe, creating a single polity stretching from Portugal to the Bering Strait. Orwell frequently describes the face of the standard Eurasian as "mongolic" in the novel, and not as European. The only soldiers other than Oceanians that appear in the novel are the Eurasians. When a large number of captured soldiers are executed in Victory Square, some Slavs are mentioned, but the stereotype of the Eurasian maintained by the Party is Asian, like O'Brien's servant, Martin. This implies that the Party uses racism in order to dehumanise the enemy in a way that would be more difficult to accomplish if they were depicted as white Europeans.
According to Goldstein's book, Eurasia's main natural defence is its vast territorial extent while the ruling ideology of Eurasia is reported in the book to be "Neo-Bolshevism"
Eastasia.
Eastasia's borders are not as clearly defined as those of the other two superstates, but it is known that they at least comprise most of modern day China, Japan, Taiwan and Korea. Eastasia repeatedly captures and loses Indonesia, New Guinea and the various Pacific archipelagos. Its political ideology is, according to the novel, "called by a Chinese name usually translated as Death-worship, but perhaps better rendered as 'Obliteration of the Self'". No such word exists in Chinese (The literal translation is 死亡崇拜, or "Sǐwáng chóngbài"), although the North Korean ideology of "Juche" has a roughly similar trait of not being able to be translated easily into English. In any case, the totalitarian regime depicted could be expected to create its own version of Newspeak, with new Chinese words not known before. 
Not much information about Eastasia is given in the book. It is known that it is the newest and smallest of the three superstates. According to Goldstein's book, it emerged a decade after the establishment of the other two superstates, placing it somewhere in the 1960s, after years of "confused fighting" among its predecessor nations (at the time of writing, the victory of Mao Zedong's Communists in the Chinese Civil War was not yet taken as a foregone conclusion). It is also said in the book that the industriousness and fecundity of the people of Eastasia allows them to overcome their territorial inadequacy in comparison to the other two powers. At the time Orwell wrote the book, East Asians, including the Japanese, all had birth rates higher than those of Europeans.
It is noteworthy that H.G. Wells' 1908 novel "The War in the Air" – with which Orwell might have been familiar – depicts a future in which Japan and China have united into a single "Confederation of East Asia" which becomes a major world power.
Disputed area.
The "disputed area", which lies "between the frontiers of the super-states", is "a rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville, Darwin, and Hong Kong" This area is fought over during the perpetual war among the three great powers, with one power sometimes exerting control over vast swathes of the disputed territory, only to lose it again the next time the alliances switch. Control of the islands in the Pacific and the polar regions is also constantly shifting, though none of the three superpowers ever gains a lasting hold on these regions. The inhabitants of the area, having no allegiance to any nation, live in a constant state of slavery under whichever power controls them at that time.
Eastasia and Eurasia fight over "a large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet."
At one point during the novel Julia is able to procure real tea to share with Winston, and remarks that she thinks Oceania recently captured India (or perhaps parts of India, but such "control" is usually transient).
International relations.
The world of "Nineteen Eighty-Four" exists in a state of perpetual war among the three major powers. At any given time, two of the three states are aligned against the third; for example Oceania and Eurasia against Eastasia or Eurasia and Eastasia against Oceania. However, as Goldstein's book points out, each Superstate is so powerful that even an alliance of the other two cannot destroy it, resulting in a continuing stalemate. From time to time, one of the states betrays its ally and sides with its former enemy. In Oceania, when this occurs, the Ministry of Truth rewrites history to make it appear that the current state of affairs is the way it has always been, and documents with contradictory information are destroyed in the memory hole.
Goldstein's book states that the war is not a war in the traditional sense, but simply exists to use up resources and keep the population in line. Victory for any side is not attainable or even desirable, but the Inner Party, through an act of doublethink, believes that such victory is in fact possible. Although the war began with the limited use of atomic weapons in a limited atomic war in the 1950s, none of the combatants use them any longer for fear of upsetting the balance of power. Relatively few technological advances have been made (the only two mentioned are the replacement of bombers with "rocket bombs" and of traditional capital ships with the immense "floating fortresses").
Ambiguity.
Almost all of the information about the world beyond London is given to the reader through government or Party sources, which by the very premise of the novel are unreliable. Specifically, in one episode Julia brings up the idea that the war is fictional and that the rocket bombs falling from time to time on London are fired by the government of Oceania itself, in order to maintain the war atmosphere among the population (better known as a false flag operation). The protagonists have no means of proving or disproving this theory. However, during preparations for Hate Week, rocket bombs fell at an increasing rate, hitting places such as playgrounds and crowded theatres, causing mass casualties and increased hysteria and hatred for the party's enemies. War is also a convenient pretext for maintaining a huge military–industrial complex in which the state is committed to developing and acquiring large and expensive weapons systems which almost immediately become obsolete and require replacement.
Because of this ambiguity, it is entirely possible that the geopolitical situation described in Goldstein's book is entirely fictitious; perhaps The Party controls the whole world, or perhaps its power is limited to just Great Britain as a lone and desperate rogue nation using fanaticism and hatred of the outside world to compensate for political impotence. It's also possible that a genuine resistance movement exists, or that Oceania is indeed under attack by outside forces.

Höglund murder.
On April 5, 2008, 10-year-old Engla Juncosa Höglund went missing on her way home from football practice in Stjärnsund, Sweden. When she did not answer her mobile phone, Engla Höglund's mother, Carina Höglund, went looking for her. Carina Höglund found her daughter's abandoned bicycle in the woods. A person had taken photos after testing his new digital camera on the road and snapped a photo of Höglund on her way home. He had also snapped a photo of a car following the girl; the photo was of a red Saab 900 driven by Eklund. After the photographer stepped forward, Eklund was arrested and told police where to find Höglund's body on April 13, 2008. Höglund's death became headline news, as most people had high hopes of finding the girl alive.

Greeks in Albania

"About a general view on history, geography, demographics and political issues concerning the region, see Northern Epirus."
The Greeks of Albania are ethnic Greeks who live in or originate from areas within modern Albania. They are mostly concentrated in the south of the country, in the areas of the northern part of the historical region of Epirus, in parts of Vlorë County, Gjirokastër, Korçë and Berat County. The area is also known as Northern Epirus. Consequently, the Greeks hailing specifically from South Albania/Northern Epirus are widely known as Northern Epirotes ( "Vorioipirotes", ). The Greeks who live in the 'minority zones' of Albania are officially recognized by the Albanian government as the Greek minority in Albania (, ).
In 1913, after the end of five centuries of Ottoman rule, the area was included under the sovereignty of the newly founded Albanian state. The following year, Greeks revolted and declared their independence, and with the following Protocol of Corfu the area was recognized as an autonomous region under nominal Albanian sovereignty, however, this was never implemented.
In modern times, the Greek population has suffered from the prohibition of the Greek language if spoken outside the recognized so-called 'minority zones' (which have remained after the communist era) and even limitations on the official use of its language within those zones. According to Greek minority leaders, the existence of Greek communities outside the 'minority zones' is even outright denied. Many formerly Greek place-names have been officially changed to Albanian ones. Greeks from the 'minority zones' were also frequently forcibly moved to other parts of the country since they were seen as possible sources of dissent and ethnic tension. During communist rule many Greek members of Albanian political parties were forced to cut off their ties with the Orthodox Church. In more recent times, the numbers of the minority have dwindled.
Northern Epirus.
The Greek minority in Albania is concentrated in the south of the country, along the border with Greece, an area referred to by Greek as "Northern Epirus". The largest concentration is in the districts of Sarandë, Gjirokastër (especially in the area of Dropull), Delvinë, and in Himara (part of the district of Vlorë). Smaller groups can be found in the districts of Kolonjë, Përmet and Korçë. In addition, Greeks communities are found in all the large cities of Albania, including the capital Tiranë, Fier, Durrës, Elbasan, and Shkodër. In more recent times, the numbers of the minority have dwindled. According to an estimate in 2005 more than 80% have migrated to Greece. However, in more recent years the majority of emigrants holding Albanian citizenship in general dropped and many of them eventually returned from Greece to Albania. As a result in regions such as Himara, part of the ethnic Greek communities that initially moved to Greece have returned.
Recognized Greek 'minority zone'.
During the communist regime (1945–1991), Enver Hoxha, in order to establish control over the areas populated by the Greek minority, declared the so-called “minority zones” (), consisting of 99 villages in the southern districts of Gjirokastër, Sarandë and Delvina.
Tirana's official minority policy defines the Greek origin of Albanian citizens according to the language, religion, birth and ancestors originating from the areas of the so-called “minority zones”. The Albanian law on minorities acknowledges the rights of the Greek minority only to those people who live in the areas which are recognized as minority zones. The last census that included ethnicity, from 1989, included only the numbers of the Greek minority in the minority zones. Ethnic Greeks living outside those areas were not counted as such. This has had a practical effect in the area of education: With the exception of the officially-recognized Greek minority zones, where teaching was held in both the Greek and Albanian languages, in all other areas of Albania lessons were taught only in the Albanian language.
Other Greek communities in Albania.
However, the official Albanian definition about minorities did not recognize as members of a minority ethnic Greeks who live in mixed villages and towns inhabited by both Greek and Albanian speaking populations, even in areas where ethnic Greeks form a majority (e.g. Himara). Consequently, the Greek communities in Himarë, Korce, Vlorë and Berat did not have access to any minority rights.
Contrary to the official Albanian definition, that generally provides a limited definition of the ethnic Greeks living in Albania, Greek migration policy defines the Greek origin on the basis of language, religion, birth and ancestors from the region called Northern Epirus. In that way, according to the Greek State Council, the Greek ethnic origin can be granted on the basis of cultural ancestry (sharing “common historical memories” and/or links with “historic homelands and culture”), Greek descent (Greek Albanians have to prove that the birthplace of their parents or grandparents is in Northern Epirus), language, and religion.
Albanian sources often use the pejorative term 'filogrek' (pro-Greek) in relation to ethnic Greeks, usually in a context disputing their Greek ancestry.
Aromanians.
A substantial number of Vlachs (Aromanians) in the region have historically self-identified as Greeks. They are mostly concentrated in the southern part of the country in the districts of Sarandë, Vlorë, Fier, Gjirokastër, Përmet, Tepelenë, Devoll and Korçë. Vickers suggests that a certain number of them have claimed to be Greek in exchange for benefits such as Greek pensions, Greek Passports and visas.
Diaspora.
Greece.
At the end of the second World War approximately 35,000 Northern Epirotes found refuge in Greece.
Since the collapse of the communist regime in Albania in 1990, an estimated 200,000 ethnic Greeks from Albania are believed to live and work (some of them on a seasonal basis) in Greece as immigrants. They are considered 'omogeneis' (co-ethnics) by the Greek Ministry of the Interior and have received special residency permits available only to members of the Greek minority from Albania.
North America.
A number of Northern Epirotes have migrated since the late 19th century to the Americas, and are generally integrated in the local Greek-American communities. The Pan-Epirotic Union of America, an organization which consists of 26 branches in various cities, according to its estimates counted nearly 30,000 Northern Epirotes in North America in 1919. Notably, in the same year around 1,700 members of the Greek Northern Epirote diaspora from Korce (Korytsa) and Kolonje (Kolonia) petitioned the on-going Paris Peace Conference for the unification of the region with Greece.
According to post-war sources, Northern Epirotes in America numbered over 15,000 families in 1965.
Australia.
Northern Epirotes also emigrated in Australia, where they are active in raising political issues related to their motherland and the rights of the Greek populations still living there. The largest number of such persons are in the state of Victoria.
Culture.
Language.
Northern Epirotes speak a southern Greek dialect. In addition to Albanian loanwords, it retains some archaic forms and words that are no longer used in Standard Modern Greek, as well as in the Greek dialects of southern Epirus. Despite the relatively small distances between the various town and villages, there exists some dialectal variation, most noticeably in accent. Though Northern Epirote is a southern dialect, it is located far north of the reduced unstressed vowel system isogloss with the archaic disyllabic -ea. Thus, the provenance of the dialect ultimately remains obscure, and more research in this direction is needed.
The local Greek dialects (especially the Chimariotic and the Argyrokastritic) are a more conservative and a purer Greek idiom (similarly to that spoken in the Mani peninsula in Greece, and the Griko language of Apulia in Italy), because they were spoken by populations living under virtual autonomy during Ottoman rule due to the rugged nature of the region. Thus, separated from other Greek dialects, the Northern Epirote Greek dialect underwent slower evolution, preserving a more archaic and faithful picture of the medieval Greek vernacular. The isolation of Albania during the years of communist rule, which separated the Greeks living in Albania from other Greek communities, also contributed to the slower evolution and differentiation of the local Greek dialects.
Religion.
Christianity spread to the region during the 4th century. The following centuries saw the erection of characteristic examples of Byzantine architecture such as the churches in Kosine, Mborje and Apollonia. Later, between 1500–1800, impressive ecclesiastical art flourished across Northern Epirus. In Moscopole there were over 23 churches during the city's period of prosperity in the mid 18th century. Post-Byzantine architectural style is prevalent in the region, e.g. in Vithkuq, Labove, Mesopotam, Dropull.
Music.
Epirote folk music has several unique features not found in the rest of the Greek world. Singers from the Pogon region (as well as in the Greek part of Upper Pogoni) perform a style of polyphony -typically shared with the Albanian and Vlach music of Epirus- that is characterized by a pentatonic structure. Another type of polyphonic singing in the region seems to have features in common with the lament songs () sung in some parts of Greece. The female lament singing of Northern Epirus is similar in nature and performance with that of the Mani peninsula in Greece.
In recent years there has been a growing interest in polyphonic music from this region, most notably by noted musician Kostas Lolis, born near what the Greeks call Sopiki in Albania but now resident in Ioanina in the Hellenic Republic.
Education.
Ottoman era.
During the first period of Ottoman occupation, illiteracy was a main characteristic of the wider Balkan region, but contrary to that situation, Epirus was not negatively affected. Along with the tolerance of the Turkish rulers and the desires of wealthy Epirote emigrants in the diaspora, many schools were established.
The spiritual and ethnic contribution of the monastery schools in Epirus such as Katsimani (near Butrint), Drianou (in Droviani), Kamenas (in Delvina) and St. Athanasios in Policani (13th-17th century) was significant. The first Greek-language school in Delvine was founded in 1537, when the town was still under Venetian control, while in Gjirokastër a Greek school was founded in 1633. The most important impetus for the creation of schools and the development of Greek education was given by the Orthodox missionary Cosmas of Aetolia together with the Aromanian Nektarios Terpos from Moscopole. Cosmas the Aetolian founded the Acroceraunian School, harkening back to the region's name in classical antiquity, in the town of Himara in 1770.
In Moscopole, an educational institution known as the ""New Academy" () and an extensive library were established during the 18th century. A local Epirote monk founded in 1731 the first printing-press in the Balkans (second only to that of Constantinople). However, after the destruction of Moscopole (1769), the center of Greek education in the region moved to nearby Korçë.
In the late 19th century, the wealthy banker Christakis Zografos founded the Zographeion College in his hometown of Qestorat, in the region of Lunxhëri. Many of the educated men that supported Greek culture and education in the region, then the culture of the Orthodox Patriarchate, were Vlachs by origin. In 1905, Greek education was flourishing in the region, as the entire Orthodox population, including Orthodox Albanians, was educated in Greek schools.
However, in the northernmost districts of Berat and Durrës, the above numbers do not reflect the ethnological distribution, because a large number of students were Orthodox Albanians.
Albanian state (1912-1991).
When Albania was created in 1912, the educational rights of the Greek communities in Albanian territory were granted by the Protocol of Corfu (1914) and with the statement of Albania's representatives in the League of Nations (1921). However, under a policy of assimilation, the Greek schools (there were over 360 until 1913) were gradually forced to close and Greek education was virtually eliminated by 1934. Following the intervention by the League of Nations, a limited number of schools, only those inside the "official minority zones", were reopened.
During the years of the communist regime, Greek education was also limited to the so-called "minority zone", in parts of the districts of Gjirokastër, Delvina and Sarande, and even then pupils were taught only Albanian history and culture at the primary level. If a few Albanian families moved into a town or village, the minority's right to be educated in Greek and publish in Greek newspapers was revoked.
Post cold war period (1991-present).
One of the major issues between the Albanian government and the Greek minority in Albania is that of education and the need for more Greek-language schools, due to overcrowded classrooms and unfulfilled demand. In addition, the Greek minority remands that Greek language education be made available outside the "official minority zones". In 2006, the establishment of a Greek-language university in Gjirokastër was agreed upon after discussions between the Albanian and Greek government. Also in 2006, after years of unanswered demands by the local community, a private Greek-language school opened in the town of Himarë, at the precise location where the Orthodox missionary Cosmas the Aetolian founded the Acroceraunian School. The school currently has five teachers and 115 pupils.
Benefaction.
A number of people from the prosperous Northern Epirote diaspora of the 18th-19th centuries made significant contributions not only to their homeland, but also to the Greek state and to the Greek world under Ottoman Turkish domination. They donated fortunes for the construction of educational, cultural and social institutions. The Sinas family supported the expansion of the University of Athens and sponsored the foundation of the National Observatory. Ioannis Pangas from Korcë gave all of his wealth for educational purposes in Greece. The Zappas brothers, Evangelos and Konstantinos, endowed Athens with an ancient Greek-style marble stadium (the Kallimarmaro) that has hosted Olympic Games in 1870, 1875, 1896, 1906 and 2004, and the Zappeion exhibition center. The Zappas brothers also founded a number of hospitals and schools in Athens and Constantinople. Christakis Zografos in the Ottoman capital offered vast amounts of money for the establishments of two Greek schools (one for boys, known as Zographeion Lyceum, as well as one for girls), and a hospital.
Organizations.
Albania.
During the years of communist rule, any form of organization by minorities was prohibited. In 1991, when the communist regime collapsed, the political organization Omonoia () was founded, in the town of Dervican by representatives of the Greek minority. The organization has four affiliates, in Sarandë, Delvinë, Gjirokastër and Tirana, and sub-sections in Korçë, Vlorë and Përmet. Its leading forum is the General Council consisting of 45 members, which is elected by the General Conference held every two years.
The Chair of Omonoia called for the autonomy of Northern Epirus in 1991, on the basis that the rights of the minority under the Albanian constitution were highly precarious. This proposal was rejected and thereby spurred the organization's radical wing to "call for Union with Greece".
Omonoia was banned from the parliamentary elections of March 1991 on the grounds that it violated an Albanian law forbidding the "formation of parties on a religious, ethnic and regional basis". This situation was contested during the following elections on behalf of Omonoia by the Unity for Human Rights Party - a party which represents the Greek minority in the Albanian parliament. Omonoia still exists as an umbrella social and political organization, and represents approximately 100,000 to 150,000 ethnic Greeks.
Omonoia has been the center of more than one political controversy in Albania. A major political controversy erupted in 1994 when five ethnic Greek members of Omonoia were arrested, investigated, and tried for treason. Their arrest was substantially marred by procedural shortcomings in the search of their homes and offices, their detention, and their trial. None of the arrestees had access to legal counsel during their initial detention. Four of the five ethnic Greek members of Omonoia stated that, during their detention, authorities subjected them to physical and psychological pressure, including beatings, sleep deprivation, and threats of torture. The Albanian Government rejected these claims. The five ethnic Greeks also complained of lack of access to their families during the first 3 months of their 4-month investigation. During their trial, a demonstration by a group of about 100 Greek lawyers, journalists, and ethnic Greek citizens of Albania took place outside the courthouse. The Albanian Police violently broke up the protest and detained about 20 lawyers and journalists. The members of Omonoia were eventually sentenced to 6 to 8 year prison terms, which were subsequently reduced on appeal.
North America.
The Panepirotic Federation of America () was founded in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1942, by Greek immigrants from Epirus (both from the Greek and Albanian part). One of the organization's main goals has been the protection of the human rights of the Greek minority in Albania and to call on the Albanian Government to enhance its full acceptance within the community of responsible nations by restoring to the Greek minority its educational, religious, political, linguistic and cultural rights due them under bilateral and international agreements signed by Albania's representatives since the country was created in 1913, including the right to declare their ethnic and religious affiliation in a census monitored by international observers.
The organization played and still plays essential part in promoting the Northern Epirote issue. It is claimed that the Albanian-American relations worsened in 1946 due to successful lobbying by the Panepirotic Federation in promoting the Northern Epirote issue among American political circles. Albanian leader Enver Hoxha, opposing the restoration of an autonomous Northern Epirus, decided not to pursue diplomatic relations with the United States.
Australia.
The Panepirotic Federation of Australia () was founded in 1982 as a Federation of various organizations representing migrants who originated from the region of Epirus throughout Australia. It is known for its dedication to the maintenance and development of Epirotic culture in Australia, its passionate championing of the rights of the Greek minority of Northern Epirus, and plays a prominent role in the life of the Greek community in Australia. It has donated over one million dollars to works of a charitable and philanthropic nature for the Greeks of Northern Epirus. It is also affiliated with the World Council of Epirotes Abroad and the World Council of Hellenes Abroad.
The Panepirotic Federation of Australia's former president, Mr Petros Petranis has notably completed a study of Epirotic migration to Australia, which is titled "Epirots in Australia" (Greek: Οι Ηπειρώτες στην Αυστραλία), published by the National Centre for Hellenic Studies, LaTrobe University, in 2004.

TerraFire

TerraFire is a multidirectional shooter for MS-DOS. It was originally released on October 1, 1997 as shareware with a demo limiting the player to only the first 8 levels. However, in 2007 it was re-released as freeware.
The game is best called a shoot 'em up, but unlike most games of this genre, the player is free to move in any direction, with physics similar to the well-known arcade game Asteroids. Bullet patterns from enemies and obstacles are also far more sparse and predictable, and there are no bosses. The game has a total of 27 levels, where every fourth level is a bonus level which is a direct clone of the aforementioned Asteroids. The normal levels, which scroll both horizontally and vertically and wrap horizontally, have gravity and are completed by finding a nuke and dragging it out of the top of the level.
TerraFire uses pre-rendered 3D graphics and full animation, making it very graphically detailed for its time and system.

Roy Pritchard

Roy Thomas Pritchard (9 May 1925 – January 1993) was an English footballer who played 247 league games at full back in the Football League for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Aston Villa, Notts County, and Port Vale. He also played war-time football for Wolves, Mansfield Town, Notts County, Swindon Town and Walsall, and later played Southern League football for Wellington Town. He won the Fourth Division title with Port Vale in 1958–59, and won both the FA Cup with Wolves in 1949, as well as the First Division title in 1953–54.
Playing career.
Pritchard joined local side Wolverhampton Wanderers straight from school in 1941. The suspension of league football due to World War II delayed the official start of his Wolves career, though gave him the opportunity to play as a guest for Mansfield Town, Notts County, Swindon Town and Walsall. He finally made his First Division debut after the resumption of the Football League on 12 October 1946, in a 6–1 thrashing of Huddersfield Town at Molineux. This was one of just four starts under the stewardship of Ted Vizard during the 1946–47 season. Under the management of Stan Cullis, Pritchard became a regular fixture at full-back in the Wolves side over the next seven seasons. They reached fifth and sixth in the league in the 1947–48 and 1948–49 seasons, though their great success was to come in the FA Cup. Pritchard helped the team to battle through the 1948–49 FA Cup campaign, beating Chesterfield, Sheffield United, Liverpool, West Bromwich Albion and Manchester United (in a semi-final replay) to reach the 1949 FA Cup Final. He played all ninety minutes at Wembley, as Wolves defeated Leicester City 3–1. Wolves then came second in the league in the 1949–50 season, as Portsmouth's superior goal average proved decisive. They dropped to 14th place in 1950–51, but did manage to reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup. A 16th place finish in 1951–52 was then followed by a third-place finish in 1952–53. He played 27 league games in the 1953–54 season, as Wolves won their first league title with a four-point lead over Midlands rivals West Bromwich Albion. They came close to retaining their title in the 1954–55 campaign, as Chelsea won the title by four points; Pritchard featured just seven times and also missed the 1954 FA Charity Shield, as a defensive reshuffle saw him out of favour.
In February 1955, Pritchard switched clubs to fellow Midland rivals Aston Villa. His career at Villa Park never got going, and he only played three times for their first team over a two-and-a-half-year stay. Eric Houghton's "Villans" finished sixth in 1954–55, though only avoided relegation in 1955–56 on goal average. They rose to tenth in 1955–56 and won the FA Cup, though Pritchard did not feature in the final. He moved on to Notts County in November 1957, and played out the remainder of the 1957–58 season at Meadow Lane, featuring in 18 Second Division games as Tommy Lawton's side were relegated in last place. Pritchard joined Port Vale in the close season, and played 18 league games as the "Valiants" won the Fourth Division title in 1958–59. He played just six Third Division games in the 1959–60 campaign, after which manager Norman Low allowed him to leave Vale Park on a free transfer. In May 1960 he joined Southern League side Wellington Town, and remained at the club until his retirement.

Cordelia Malone

"Cordelia Malone" is a novelty song written in 1904 by Billy Jerome and Jean Schwartz, and recorded that same year by popular Irish American singer Billy Murray. The lyrics are a stableboy's first-hand account of his courtship of Cordelia Malone, a "smart Irish girl". Over the course of the song, he describes his seemingly successful efforts to woo Cordelia through use of the then newly invented telephone, stating that: 
""...Young suitors can all nightly flock 'round the door,"
"since her sister Bedelia won fame," 
"but her smiles don't you see,"
"they are only for me,"
"so they might as well leave her alone,"
"'cause she seems to rejoice at the sound of my voice "
"when I sing through the Bell telephone:"
""Hello, hello, sweet Cordelia""..."
The name given to Cordelia's sister, 'Bedelia', may be in reference to a popular 1903 song, "Bedelia (I Want to Steal Ye, Bedelia, I Love You So)", also written by Billy Jerome and Jean Schwartz.

Interferon alfa

Interferon alfa (INN, or HuIFN-alpha-Le), trade name Multiferon, is a natural interferon alpha (IFN-α) which is obtained from the leukocyte fraction of human blood following induction with Sendai virus. Interferon alfa contains several naturally occurring IFN-α subtypes and is purified by affinity chromatography.
Composition.
Interferon alfa contains a mixture of several proteins, all with structural, serological, and functional properties typical for natural interferon alpha (IFN α). The major subtypes identified are IFN-α1, IFN-α2, IFN-α8, IFN-α10, IFN-α14 and IFN-α21. Of these, IFN-α2 and IFN-α14 are glycosylated. The IFN-α content is expressed in International Units per milliliter, and the drug product is formulated in isotonic phosphate buffer solution at pH = 7.2, and supplemented with human albumin at 1.5 milligrams per milliliter. The albumin used is a medicinal product approved in several countries, and is indicated for subcutaneous injection therapy.
Pharmacology.
Summary of differences between IFN subtypes.
IFN-α8 enhances the proliferation of human B cells, as well as being able to activate NK cells.
The subtypes α10 and α2, along with α8, are the most efficient and powerful NK cell activators.
Subtypes α21 and α2 enhance the expression of IFN-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) in dendritic cells. Activated dendritic cells initiate immune responses and induce the expression of IP-10, a chemokine which promotes a Th1 inflammatory response.
IFN-α1 causes increased HLA-II expression, and can directly inhibit tumor cell growth "in vitro". However, it is a poor activator of NK cells, has relatively little anti-viral activity, does not induce B cell proliferation, and does not enhance HLA-I or tumor antigen expression. Despite its apparent inactivity, it is still used clinically in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, with a reported lower toxicity than the recombinant IFN-α2.
Overall, IFN-α has a general inflammatory action which skews the immune response towards a Th1 profile. 
Subtype α2 increases the expression of HLA-I molecules, which correlate with IFN-α mediated activation of memory CD8 cells and increased cytolytic action against virally infected cells and tumor cells (via cytotoxic CD8 cells).

FORAS (football supporters' trust)

FORAS is an Irish industrial and provident society established in 2007 to act as a Cork City Football Club supporters' trust. FORAS now operate Cork City, Cork's League of Ireland side. The name is both the Irish language word for "development" and an acronym of Friends Of (the) Rebel Army Society.
Trust formation.
A major recruitment drive was launched in September 2008, in the wake of revelations that the club was to enter the examinership process through the Irish courts. Members of the trust include former Lord Mayor of Cork, councillor Brian Bermingham, Sinn Féin TD Jonathan O'Brien and several other local politicians. Since its establishment, a significant sum of money has been raised via membership fees and donations.
Resurrection of the club.
On 23 February 2010, following the winding up and denial of a League of Ireland licence to Cork City Investments Fc Ltd (Cork City FC's holding company), FORAS were granted a First Division licence. They entered under the temporary name Cork City FORAS Co-Op. On 1 June 2010 the club completed the purchase and restoration of the Cork City FC name and history from Cork City Investments FC Ltd's liquator. The team continued to compete in the League as Cork City FORAS Co-op but the supporters, the club and most Irish media returned to referring to the club as Cork City FC.

In Public (film)

In Public () is a short documentary film directed by sixth generation filmmaker Jia Zhangke. "In Public" was filmed digitally for the 2001 Jeonju International Film Festival.
In many ways, the film was a test-run for the feature length fiction film, "Unknown Pleasures". Both films are shot in digital film (a medium Jia would return to in "Still Life" (2006) and "24 City" (2008)), both are set in the city of Datong, and both share the same shooting locations. As usual, Jia's regular collaborator Yu Lik-wai served as the film's director of photography.
The film also screened at the 2002 Marseille Festival of Documentary Film, where it won the Grand Prix.
Background.
"In Public" was made and submitted by Jia as part of a program at the 2001 Jeonju International Film Festival, where three directors were asked to produce a short film in digital video. The other two directors who produced entries that year were Taiwanese filmmaker Tsai Ming-liang and British director John Akomfrah. Setting up his camera in a train station in Datong, Jia would eventually cobble together a film consisting of thirty shots over forty-five days. 
Lacking in any formal plot, the film instead is content to capture seemingly mundane moments, customers asking for the train schedule, shots inside public buses, etc. The result, according to Chinese film scholar Berenice Reynaud, is a film that captures the "ennui, backwardness, and dreary atmosphere of a small town, and the impatience, hidden desires and private concerns of its inhabitants." For Jia, the film was a chance to focus on the public spaces in a modern provincial city of China: the train stations, discos, and karaokes of Datong.
Relationship to "Unknown Pleasures".
While filming "In Public", Jia became interested in not only the desolate-looking buildings that had originally attracted him to the city, but to the people who inhabited them. Moreover, Jia came to realize that filming with digital video would allow him unprecedented flexibility and movement, inspiring him to begin production of "Unknown Pleasures". As Jia stated at a news conference following the release of "Unknown Pleasures": "At first it was the bleak and lonely buildings that attracted me. When I saw the streets filled with lonely, directionless people, I became interested in them."
One critic, however, sees the film as more of a positive depiction of humanity than seen in "Unknown Pleasures", noting that the film's final scene of people dancing in a dilapidated community center (the same center that opens the later film) elicits a sense of "people persevering despite the impoverishment of their existence." "Unknown Pleasures", in contrast, is "incendiary bleakness and outrage."
Stylistically, "In Public" fits well into the Jia oeuvre. It situates itself between Jia's "Platform" and "Unknown Pleasures", with the long takes of the former and the same desolate locations of the latter.

Cardwellia

Cardwellia is a genus of a sole described species of large trees, constituting a part of the plant family Proteaceae. The species Cardwellia sublimis (northern silky oak) grows naturally only (endemic) in the rainforests of the wet tropics region of north eastern Queensland, Australia. Other common names include bull oak, golden spanglewood, lacewood, oak and oongaary. The compound leaves have up to 17 leaflets. It produces white inflorescences followed by woody fruits which are prominently displayed outside the canopy.
Taxonomy and naming.
Ferdinand von Mueller named the genus in honour of Edward Cardwell, who had been Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1864 to 1866. The species name is the Latin adjective "sublimis" "lofty". The type specimen was collected by John Dallachy in Rockingham Bay.
Molecular analysis indicates "Cardwellia sublimis" is a member of the subtribe Gevuininae, and is the earliest offshoot from the main ancestor of the other genera. It is thought to have separated around 35 million years ago in the late Eocene.
Description.
"Cardwellia sublimis" grows as a tall, often emergent, tree in its native rainforest habitat, reaching in height, though likely to only grow half this size in cultivation. The bark is thin, and there is no buttressing. The initial leaves are entire but juvenile leaves are generally pinnate and large, reaching long. They are composed of 3 to 10 pairs of oval to oblong leaflets, each of which is long and wide. Flowering is profuse, and the canopy can be covered with the cream-white flowerheads in late spring and summer. The inflorescences are long.
The flowers are followed by woody oval follicles, which are long and wide and contain 8 to 12 winged seeds each.
Distribution and habitat.
"Cardwellia sublimis" grows naturally in wet tropics rainforests between Townsville and Cooktown from sea level to an altitude of .
Uses and cultivation.
"Cardwellia sublimis" has potential as a specimen tree in parks, and has showy flowers and follicles. It is readily propagated from seed and has been grown successfully in Melbourne. It is a valuable timber tree in Queensland, which is easy to work with and shows an attractive grain similar to that of oak. It is used for cabinet and veneer work. Attempts to grow "Cardwellia sublimis" in plantations have not been very successful.

Bhalobasa Bhalobasa (2008 film)

Bhalobasa Bhalobasa (translation: "Love Love") is a 2008 Bengali film by Rabi Kinagi. This movie is the second film of both Hiran Chatterjee and Srabanti Malakar. After five-week running success prompted producer Ashok Dhanuka added one more song "Bol Raja Chai Kemon Rani" to the film after shooting it right after Kali Puja. This is the first Bengali film which were shoted at Salzburg in Austria. This film is the remake of the Telugu film "Bommarillu" directed and co-written by Bhaskar, starring Prakash Raj, Genelia D'Souza and Siddharth Narayan. The film primarily revolves around a father and son relationship with the father's dote on his son ironically leaving a bitter taste with the latter. The Title Track music of this film is also taken from "Bommarillu".
Plot.
The film begins with a baby taking his initial steps on a beach while the father is supporting him. The narrator in the background (Prasenjit) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child’s hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Siddhu (Hiran Chatterjee) begins uttering abuses at all the fathers in the world. When inquired about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind (Sabyasachi Chakrabarty), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairdo and many others are stashed away by his father’s. However, he vows that the two things that will be of his choice would be, his career and the woman he would marry.
Post-credits, Satya (Subhasis Mukherjee), the Arvind dutiful household’s servant wakes up Siddhu in the morning. In the background, we see Siddhu’s mother, Lakshmi (Laboni Sarkar) singing a devotional song while cooking. At the dining table, Arvind, Managing Director of their construction company, inquires if Siddhu will join their office for managing their business. When Siddhu deliberates, his father doesn’t stand any longer and instead plans for his marriage despite Siddhu's silent protest. The next week, he returns home to realize that he is going to get engaged to Subbulakshmi (Locket Chatterjee) against his wishes. He speaks with her only to realize that she is a "daddy’s girl" and she not being to his liking. However, with Arvind’s final say, they eventually get engaged.
While contemplating on his options in a temple, Siddhu accidentally meets Priya (Srabanti Malakar), an engineering student. Seeing her chirpy nature and vibrance, Siddhu begins to like her. He makes attempts to know her by meeting her on a regular basis. In the process, he starts liking her cherubic and ever-friendly nature and as someone who does what she loves. As days go by, he realizes about so many small things in her company that gave him happiness. He realizes that he has fallen in love with her.
Alongside this, Siddhu applies for a bank loan to start out on his dream of building his career. When his love for Priya deepens, he wishes to propose to her. He confesses to her that he is engaged to get married to Subbulakshmi against his wishes, but what he really wants is her. On knowing of him being engaged, Priya gets dejected, but comes back a day later and asks him to do what he wishes for and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Siddhu is seen by a furious Arvind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marriage with Subbulakshmi. When asked for his reason to like Priya, Siddhu replies saying that if Priya can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Priya to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao (Sushanta Dutta) that she is going on a college tour.
When Priya is introduced to Siddhu’s family, she gets a lukewarm welcome. As she settles down in the house, one after the other begins to like her. Even though getting used to the living habits of the authoritarian Arvind's household was difficult, Priya stayed put for Siddhu's sake. In the meanwhile, Arvind reprimands Siddhu when he knows of his bank loan and his plans, only to further enrage Siddhu. One day the entire family along with Priya attends a marriage ceremony. A cheerful Priya cheers up the ceremony with her playful nature. Coincidentally, Kanaka Rao who happens to be around, recognizes Siddhu as the drunken young man whom he encountered on an earlier occasion. Priya realizes her father's presence and quickly exits to avoid his attention. After saving their grace, Siddhu admonishes Priya for her antics at the marriage. A sad and angry Priya moves out of the house saying that she does not find Siddhu the same and that she cannot put on an act if she stays in their house. After getting back to her house, she rebuilds the trust her father has in her while Siddhu is left forlorn. Lakshmi confronts Arvind on Siddhu’s choices and wants. In the process, Siddhu opens up his heart and leaving Arvind to repent on his foolishness. Siddhu requests Subbulakshmi and her parents to call off the impending marriage. While they relent, Arvind manages to convince Kanaka babu about Siddhu and Priya's marriage. In return, Kanaka wants to know more about Siddhu by having him live in house for a week. Arvind agrees with this and as the story returns to the pre-credits scene, the viewers are left to assume about the happy marriage of the protagonists.

The music of "Bhalobasa Bhalobasa", composed by S. P. Venkatesh, was released in India on 22 September 2008 The soundtrack has been at the number one spot on the music charts for several consecutive weeks. Media partner of "Bhalobasa Bhalobasa" is Bengali Music Channel Sangeet Bangla.

Biography.
He was a cameraman during the Nazi era, and worked with Leni Riefenstahl on several of her Nazi propaganda films as well as on her Olympia film. During World War II he was among the preferred cameramen accompanying (then) General Rommel which earned him a reputation as "Rommel's photographer".
In the mid-1950s he resettled in Bolivia where he made two "expedition film"-like documentaries of feature length. He embarked on a third, but ceased after his tractor crashed through a wooden bridge with two thirds of the (uninsured) exposed footage on board. Frustrated he then decided to become a farmer and retired to a piece of semi-jungle land in Eastern Bolivia.
Ertl was the father of the guerrilla Monika Ertl, he was also an acquaintance of Klaus Barbie and, earlier, supposedly a lover of Riefenstahl. He rarely returned to Germany where he felt cheated out of an important film award, but days before his death he reportedly asked his daughter in Bavaria to send him a bag of German soil. Ertl died in 2000 and he was buried on his farm which is now a museum.

Dunfermline City Chambers

Dunfermline City Chambers is a building historically designed to be the centre of local government in Dunfermline, Fife. In more recent times most of these functions have been devolved to other locations, but of 2008 the impressive edifice still houses the Council Chambers, the Burgh Court and Dunfermline's Registrar Office. 
The building, constructed in the period 1875-79, was created by James C Walker who also designed the first Carnegie Library. It employs a harmonious composite of French, Gothic and Scots baronial architectural styles and features a prominent four-face clock tower. It was constructed on the site of an older Town House of 1771 which was in its turn built to replace the 17th century Town House, demolished as part of 18th century improvements to make way for Bridge Street. 
There are many features of historic and architectural significance in the building. The structure includes heraldic stones recovered from the demolished 1771 Town House. These are plausibly believed to have originated from the now derelict Royal Palace of Dunfermline a few hundred yards to the south. The finely designed interior of the City Chambers incorporates many notable features, in particular the oak hammer beam roof which provides the ceiling for the Council Chamber itself. The historic police cells, although no longer in use, have also been preserved. 
Furnishings include a number of notable artworks including busts of several Scottish sovereigns, a statue of Robert Burns, Sir Joseph Noel Paton's painting, "Spirit of Religion", and an early twentieth century portrait of King Malcolm and Queen Margaret.

A forest chapel dedicated to saint Anne was burned down shortly before this church's construction. The inhabitants of Waterloo wished to rebuild it but were prevented from doing so by financial difficulties. The wood-producers in the area paid a tax - every hundredth denier - on their sales to raise money, but even after 20 years the total sum raised was not enough. 
The new governor-general of the Spanish Netherlands, Don Francisco Antonio de Agurto, marquis de Gastañaga, then intervened. The marquis decided that building a new chapel on the site dedicated to saint Joseph (a spiritual model to Agurto's sovereign Charles II) would be a good way of remedying the sickly Charles's continuing and desperate sterility (despite his two marriages he had produced no heir). The ceremony of laying the first stone took place on 26 June 1687, in the presence of the Archbishopr of Mechelen. Like all buildings of this era, the edifice's architecture (attributed to the Wallonian architect Philippe Delsaux) borrows from the language of French Baroque classicism - a rotonda, a dome and above all a colonnaded portico refer to classical antiquity and give the edifice a wholly royal solemnity. This is reinforced by the presence of two lions on the portico's pediment. It is an imposing monument, in contrast to the modest size of the hamlets which it serves. Inaugurated with great ceremony on 19 February 1690, the marquis's pious intentions had no effect on Charles' sterility or on his own career - he was recalled to Madrid for not defending Mons well enough to prevent its capture by the French.
Heyday.
The hazards of administrative divisions complicated the life of the new royal chapel. Built on the edge of the Sonian Forest, at the place called "petit Waterloo", it depended on the parish of Sint-Genesius-Rode and partly on the Diocese of Mechelen. Most of the hamlet, "grand Waterloo", was within the parish of Braine-l'Alleud, in the Diocese of Namur. To avoid split loyalties, the priest at Braine wanted to merge the chapel into his parish and, despite opposition, he temporarily managed to save the old priest at St. Genesius Rode the long and dangerous trip across the forest. The death of Rode's priest brought the question up again, with the Habsburg government Brussels keeping a firm hand on the nomination of the chapel's rector, since it was a royal foundation paid for by the Spanish government. Despite fierce proposals, the priest at Braine was separated in favour of Guillaume-Albert Le Roy, who had been chaplain for 3 years.
French Revolution.
Shortly after the French Revolution and France's annexation of the southern Netherlands, the royal chapel was sold as state property of the French Republic. An unscrupulous Parisian businessman Thomas Gillet bought it at a knock-down price, having already acquired the neighbouring abbeys of Aywiers and Wauthier-Braine. From then on mass was celebrated secretly in a barn at the farm of Philippe Pastur's widow by the brave abbot Bierlaire, an opponent of the French occupied like most of his Brabançon fellow-priests. To cash in on his investments, the speculator dismantled the buildings and sold the materials, stripping the lead off the royal chapel's roof to sell to army suppliers to make rifle bullets, but local opposition was so strong that he hesitated to continue. In the meantime Napoleon signed the Concordat of 1801 with the pope and Waterloo became an autonomous parish. The town called on their fellow-countrymen's generosity to buy back the chapel and put it back in religious use, with the first ceremony being on 10 June 1806.
The building contains several memorial plaques to officers falling at the Battle of Waterloo. In particular, several refer to Restalrig barracks in Edinburgh, home of the Scots Greys who made a famous cavalry charge during the battle.
The baroque building proved too small to accommodate the congregations of up to 1,500 coming to mass here (a first expansion project had already been designed by Louis Montoyer in 1789 shortly before the Revolution). Having for a moment thought of demolishing the chapel anew and rebuilding a church at Mont-Saint-Jean, the idea of expansion resurfaced and was felt to be an easier option, since the town had access to sufficient land to do so. After some time raising gifts and subsidies, the works were completed in 1823 and 1824. A brick hall with a slate roof extended the dome towards the back. Closed off towards the street, it then joined the choir. The masterpieces of church furniture - the pulpit and the massive sculpted-oak communion benches - were recovered from the abbey of the Blanches Dames at Aywier.
Thirty years later, between 1855 and 1858, the structure was again restored and extended, giving it three neo-classical naves, a dome on the west side, and a square brick tower with (from 1899) a 22m high copper spire. The interior was rebuilt in white stone and stucco, with Ionic pilasters supporting a heavy entablature on which were supported the crossed arches of the roof and the calotte of the cupola, lit up by a lantern and six bull's-eyes. The British participated financially in the project. The architects Émile Coulon and Joseph Dumont, major specialists in religious architecture, were brought in. A renowned organ maker called Pierre-Hubert Anneessens added such a good organ that it was sold a century later, in troubled circumstances, by a less scrupulous restorer (it is now in a small church in the southern Netherlands).
20th century.
Despite the rotonda and portico being named as historic monuments in 1956, the church was in a poor state due to the two World Wars, storms and the first effects of car air-pollution. An urgent intervention project was launched on the 150th anniversary of the nearby Battle of Waterloo in 1965, with British help and led by the descendents of soldiers who fought there. The architect Albert Degand was put in charge of removing the 19th century additions which spoiled the structure, such as the rood screen, commemorative plaques, and the coatings covering the stone. The renovation was completed in 1972 and consecrated the division between the royal chapel and the body of the church. The entry arch towards the church was walled in, leaving only the a glass door evoking the dimensions and frame of the portico.
The presbytery.
To the right of the church, the former presbytery (built during the first expansion) shows a beautiful neo-classical façade. The entrepreneur was inspired by Louis Montoyer's plans, archived on the Revolution, to build this hôtel on a square plan, with a set of steps up to it formerly surmounted by a pedimented porch. Falling out of use in 1968 due to its poor state, it housed various associations, community services and even the mayoral office until it was renovated in 1995 to house the tourist federation of the new province of Brabant Wallon. 
Later when the tourist federation was dismantled, the tourist office for Waterloo and the neighbouring municipalities was established in the building. There is also a museum about the history of the commune of Waterloo on the first floor.

Electoral district of Wembley Beaches

The Electoral district of Wembley Beaches was a Legislative Assembly electorate in the state of Western Australia. The district was named for the inner western Perth suburb of Wembley, which fell within its borders. 
Wembley Beaches came into existence at the 1950 election, and was largely created from the northern and coastal sections of the Leederville, which had grown considerably in population in the years immediately following World War II. The seat included the inner suburbs of Floreat Park, Jolimont and Wembley, and areas further north including Doubleview, Gwelup, Innaloo, North Beach, Scarborough, Trigg and Watermans Bay. While reasonably safe for the Liberal Party, Wembley Beaches was won for a term by the Labor, who were relatively strong in the Scarborough and Innaloo region throughout the seat's existence.
The seat was abolished ahead of the 1962 election, with its area being split between the seats of Wembley and Karrinyup. Les Nimmo, the sitting member, contested and won the latter.

Mr. Gannosuke

Professional wrestling career.
Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (1991–1995).
In 1987, he met Eiji Ezaki, while attending Kumamoto Gakuen University. In February 1991, Ezaki and Honda joined the Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) Dojo, where they were trained by Tarzan Goto. Honda made his debut for FMW in June 1991 against Akihito Ichihara. He and Ezaki wrestled as a tag team and against each other on the cards, until Onita saw potential in Honda. Onita gave him the name Mr. Gannosuke, after actor Ashiya Gannosuke.
With a new name, Mr. Gannosuke moved up to the upper mid-card, with the occasional main event status. In main events, Gannosuke would team up with Atsushi Onita in numerous tag team death matches. In February 1995, Gannosuke won his first championship, the FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship with Onita, defeating Mr. Pogo and The Gladiator. Their reign was short-lived, as they lost the belts two months later back to Mr. Pogo and his new partner, Yukihiro Kanemura. On April 23, 1995, however, Gannosuke, along with Tarzan Goto and Flying Kid Ichihara, announced that they were leaving FMW.
International Wrestling Association of Japan (1995–1996).
Upon his arrival in International Wrestling Association of Japan in May 1995, Mr. Gannosuke was heavily pushed alongside Tarzan Goto and Flying Kid Ichihara as the top villains, as the stable, Shin-FMW. Gannosuke also aligned himself with Terry Gordy.
In August 1995, Gannosuke took part in the IWA King Of The Deathmatch tournament, losing to Tiger Jeet Singh in a Barbed Wire Chain Death match in the first round. Two months later, he teamed with Tarzan Goto to win the IWA World Tag Team Championship, defeating Cactus Jack and Tracy Smothers. Another two months later, Gannosuke and Goto won their second set of tag team gold in the NWA World Tag Team Championship, defeating Cactus Jack and Tiger Jeet Singh, despite having a bye to the finals. Despite holding two sets of tag team titles, IWA Japan lost tons of money and suspended operations. In October 1996, Shin-FMW left, forcing Gannosuke and Goto to vacate both the IWA and NWA World Tag Team titles, although they wrestled their last match for the promotion in November 1996.
Tokyo Pro Wrestling (1996–1997).
Mr. Gannosuke, along with Goto and Ichihara ended up in Tokyo Pro Wrestling, but by December 1996, it went out of business.
Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (1997–2002).
In January 1997, Mr. Gannosuke and Ichihara returned to FMW, confronting Hayabusa, upset that Hayabusa did not leave FMW with him. They joined Terry Funk's Funk Masters of Wrestling stable. In February 1997, he wrestled his first match back, teaming with Hisakatsu Oya to defeat Hayabusa and Ricky Fuji. Gannosuke went on a vicious streak, defeating other wrestlers and calling them victories over Hayabusa. In April 1997, Hayabusa and Gannosuke finally wrestled one-on-one in a mask vs. hair match. Despite Hayabusa winning the match, Hayabusa did not want to cut Gannosuke's hair, instead he wanted to shake hands and be friends again. Instead, Gannosuke attacked him and ripped off his mask, before Jinsei Shinzaki made the save.
In August 1997, Gannosuke won the FMW World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship with Oya and The Gladiator, defeating Fuyuki-Gun (Kodo Fuyuki, Jado, and Gedo) in a tournament final. Two weeks later, Gannosuke and Oya won the FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship, defeating W*ING Kanemura and Bad Boy Hido. By the end of the month, Gannosuke lost the 6-Man Tag Team title to Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka, and Koji Nakagawa. By October, Gannosuke had joined ZEN, led by Atsushi Onita. Within weeks, however, Gannosuke and Kanemura were arguing with Onita. In November 1997, Gannosuke and Kanemura won back the FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship that Onita and Kanemura vacated. In December 1997, Gannosuke, Kanemura, and Hido broke away from ZEN to form their own group, alongside Miss Mongol.
In January 1998, Gannosuke defeated Masato Tanaka to win the FMW Double Title. A day later, Gannosuke's group and Fuyuki-Gun merged to form Team No Respect, with Gannosuke as their leader. In March 1998, he and Kanemura lost the Brass Knuckles Tag Team title to Kodo Fuyuki and Bad Boy Hido. By the end of April 1998, Gannosuke lost the Double Title to Hayabusa. During the match, Gannosuke dislocated his knee, which required reconstructive surgery and to be out of action for six months. Kodo Fuyuki took over as leader of Team No Respect.
Gannosuke made his in-ring return in November 1998, defeating Tetsuhiro Kuroda. He won the Over The Top tournament, defeating Koji Nakagawa, Yukihiro Kanemura, Bad Boy Hido, and Hisakatsu Oya to become the number one contender to the Double title, now held by Kodo Fuyuki. Gannosuke formed Gannosuke's Outlaws with Hideki Hosaka and Super Leather. His title shot occurred in March 1999, losing to Fuyuki; it would be his final shot at the title.
In May 1999, Gannosuke rejoined Team No Respect, disbanding Gannosuke's Outlaws. He was given the FMW Independent Heavyweight Championship by Kodo Fuyuki, who was splitting the Double Title. He lostthe title in August 1999 to Masato Tanaka. Five days later, he challenged Hayabusa for the FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship in Hayabusa's final match under the persona, which Gannosuke lost. Two days later, Hayabusa, now known as H, supposedly injured Gannosuke in a match, causing him to be out of action for a while. In September, a major swerve occurred when Gannosuke returned as "Hayabusa." Hayabusa and H were involved in a feud for much of 1999, which ended in November in a match, where Shawn Michaels was the special referee. After the match, H and Gannosuke embraced. In December, H and Gannosuke won the WEW Tag Team Championship, defeating Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Hisakatsu Oya. In February 2000, H and Gannosuke lost the title to Kodo Fuyuki and Kyoko Inoue. In May 2000, Gannosuke betrayed H and joined Shin-Fuyuki-Gun. Gannosuke, however, started to question Shoichi Arai about FMW's direction. After clotheslining Arai, he was (kayfabe) fired. In November 2000, he lost to Tetsuhiro Kuroda, which caused him to (kayfabe) retire from wrestling (in reality, he was taking time off for the birth of his daughter).
In April 2001, Gannosuke made his full-fledged return, aligning himself with Tetsuhiro Kuroda in his feud with Hayabusa and The Great Sasuke, which culminated on May 5 in an Exploding Octagon Cage Death match, which he lost. In June 2001, he realigned with Kodo Fuyuki in his feud with Shoichi Arai and Hayabusa. In July 2001, Gannosuke, Fuyuki, and Kintaro Kanemura defeated Ricky Fuji, Hisakatsu Oya, and Flying Kid Ichihara to win the WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship. Two months later, he and Mammoth Sasaki won the WEW Tag Team Championship, defeating GOEMON and Onryo. The same month, Gannosuke, Fuyuki, and Kanemura lost the 6-Man Tag Team title to Hayabusa, Kuroda, and GOEMON.
Tragedy struck in FMW in October 2001, as Gannosuke's closest friend and rival, Hayabusa, suffered a career-ending neck injury in a match against Mammoth Sasaki. In January 2002, Gannosuke injured both his ankles in a six-man tag team match, causing him to be out of action as well. With Hayabusa and Gannosuke out of action and millions of dollars in debt, FMW shut down in February 2002.
Later Career (2002–2008).
Between August 2002 and December 2008, Mr. Gannosuke wrestled for several promotions, including Wrestling Marvelous Future, Apache Pro-Wrestling, Fuyuki Army, Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE, All Japan Pro Wrestling, Fighting World of Japan Pro Wrestling, Kings Road, Dradition, Ice Ribbon, DDT, and his own promotion. He wrestled his final match on December 27, 2008, teaming with Jinsei Shinzaki and Mammoth Sasaki to defeat Masato Tanaka, Kintaro Kanemura, and Tetsuhiro Kuroda when he pinned Kanemura.
Gannosuke now promotes shows under his own name about every four months and is a trainer for Emi Sakura's Ice Ribbon promotion. He also runs his bar called "NOV Bar" every night.

SS City of Peking

SS "City of Peking" was an iron-hulled steamship built in 1874 by John Roach & Sons for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. "City of Peking" and her sister ship "City of Tokio" were at the time of construction the largest vessels ever built in the United States, and the second largest in the world behind the British leviathan .
Like "Great Eastern", construction of the two Pacific Mail ships was to be plagued with financial difficulties, which threatened to bankrupt the shipbuilder. Unlike "Great Eastern", however, which was a commercial failure, "City of Peking" would go on to have a long and successful commercial career.
In addition to her cargoes, "City of Peking" brought many Chinese and Japanese immigrants to the United States, and later served as a troopship in the Spanish-American War.
Construction.
In 1865 the Pacific Mail Steamship Company had obtained a $500,000 annual subsidy from the U.S. Congress to operate a steam packet between the United States, China and Japan. On June 1, 1872, Congress approved an additional $500,000 subsidy, raising the company's total subsidy to one million dollars annually. Under the terms of the statute, the new subsidy was contingent upon the company increasing its packet to a monthly service beginning on October 1, 1873 and continuing for a period of ten years. The statute also stipulated that the company must utilize iron ships of at least 4,000 tons for the service, built in the United States and suitable for conversion into naval auxiliaries in the event of war.
With the incentive of the new half million dollar subsidy, Pacific Mail decided to upgrade its entire fleet of aging wooden side-wheelers with new iron vessels. The company it chose to build its new fleet was John Roach and Sons, which had recently opened a state-of-the-art shipyard, the Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Company, in Chester, Pennsylvania.
Pacific Mail ordered a total of nine iron ships from Roach, the first of which were to include the 4,000 ton sister ships "City of Peking" and "City of Tokio". During construction however, rumors abounded that a newly established British company, China Transpacific, was building even larger ships in England for service on the same route. Pacific Mail concluded that it would require larger ships than originally envisaged to successfully compete, and submitted new specifications, which upgraded the two ships from 4,000 to 5,000 tons. The change required a complete redesign of the hull and machinery, and Roach, who had already laid the keels and constructed the frames to meet the original specification, was forced to start from scratch, delaying the ships' completion.
Financial crisis.
Roach had initially welcomed the Pacific Mail contracts, anticipating that they would help establish a sound financial foundation for his new company. Unfortunately, in the spring of 1873, eight months into construction of the new ships, Pacific Mail reported an inability to meet its payments. Pacific Mail's President, Alden B. Stockwell, had attempted to manipulate his firm's stock price with company funds, depleting cash reserves and borrowing money to meet the company's obligations. When the stock scheme fell through, Pacific Mail's cash reserves had effectively been substituted with debt. Stockwell and another company director, Richard B. Irwin, then pocketed a loan from Roach and misappropriated about $750,000 in company funds before fleeing the country.
But worse was to come. Before his flight, Stockwell had exchanged 20,000 company shares with the notorious stock speculator Jay Gould for the sum of a million dollars. Gould now had influence on the company board, but he had no interest in immediately reviving the company's fortunes. Instead, he hatched a scheme to drive the price of the company's stock down still further, to a point where he and his co-conspirators could purchase the undervalued stock—and thus gain control of the company—at the lowest possible price. In order to realize this aim, Gould needed to somehow persuade shareholders that the company was facing financial ruin.
When Pacific Mail proved unable to initiate its new packet service on the date stipulated in the June 1872 statute, Congress was obliged to decide whether or not to cancel the subsidy. Gould seized on this issue to further his scheme of damaging the company's reputation. He organized a lobbying campaign to persuade Congress to rescind the subsidy, while Roach, concerned that without the subsidy Pacific Mail might be unable to meet its debts, lobbied for retaining it. Unknown to Roach, his trusted friend and adviser, the lawyer William E. Chandler who was acting as Roach's main Washington lobbyist, also had Gould as a client, a conflict of interest that encouraged Chandler's reticence. As a result, Roach's lobbying was ineffective at combating Gould's attempt to portray Roach as an unethical raider of the public purse.
Gould's campaign was ultimately successful and Congress canceled the subsidy. Owed a million dollars by Pacific Mail, Roach was now in financial difficulty himself as nervous creditors began calling for immediate settlement of their debts. Roach bluffed his way out of the crisis by declaring his readiness to settle any debt within three days of receiving a detailed statement. But he now had to decide whether to foreclose on Pacific Mail in order to secure at least some of his investment in the ships, or to renegotiate the payment plan. He chose the latter, accepting Pacific Mail's old ships for their scrap value as part payment, and reducing its monthly payment obligation from $75,000 to $35,000. Roach was embittered by the affair, but ironically, his handling of the crisis increased his reputation as a businessman able to deal with adverse circumstances.
Service history.
Early problems.
"City of Peking", the largest ship ever built in the United States at the time, was finally launched in March 1874 to great fanfare. Roach himself was honored with a testimonial dinner at which he was toasted—quite inaccurately, and to the chagrin of older, more established shipyards—as "the father of iron shipbuilding in America".
However, "City of Peking"'s first voyages proved troublesome. For her maiden voyage around Cape Horn to her operating port of San Francisco, she was heavily loaded with railroad iron fore and aft, while her coal was stored amidships. As the coal was consumed on the voyage, the increasingly uneven weight caused the vessel's hull to "hog" or strain excessively, loosening approximately 5,000 rivets, while some propeller blades were also lost. When she arrived in San Francisco, Roach found himself faced with a stiff $300,000 repair bill.
On her next voyage, which was also her first transpacific crossing, the problems recurred, and when she arrived in Hong Kong, Roach suffered the embarrassment of having his celebrated new vessel declared unseaworthy by the British authorities. Roach was forced to dispatch a team of workmen to effect on-the-spot repairs, and he now found himself denigrated in the American press as a builder of inferior ships. Even with the problems however, "City of Peking" had still managed to set a new speed record of 22 days on her first San Francisco to Hong Kong crossing.
Concerns about the ship's quality ultimately proved groundless. The damage sustained on these two initial voyages was determined to be caused by improper loading of the ship combined with weakness of the wooden decks, which were subsequently replaced with iron. After these repairs and modifications, "City of Peking" went on to establish an enviable record of reliability, suffering only one complete mechanical breakdown over the course of almost three decades of transpacific service. By 1879, American editorialists were again singing the praises of the great ship, while a period in drydock proved her still capable of attracting thousands of curious sightseers. "City of Peking" would eventually make a total of 116 round trips between San Francisco and Yokohama/Hong Kong in the period from 1875 to 1903.
Passengers, cargo and crew.
As a passenger-freighter, "City of Peking" was designed to carry either passengers or cargo, or both. She was outfitted to accommodate about 1,400 passengers — 120 first class, 250 second class and 1,000 steerage. The ship brought many Chinese and Japanese immigrants to the United States, many of whom settled in Hawaii or California. Cost of passage was $150 between San Francisco and Yokohama or $200 between San Francisco and Hong Kong, although the passage for Asian immigrants was frequently subsidized by government or employers.
Cargoes exported to Asia by the vessel were mostly foodstuffs, but also included hardware items such as sewing machines, stoves, clocks, trunks, furniture, firearms, leather goods, candles etc. A large range of staple foods were transported, including barley, bran, bread, beans, oats and flour, as well as processed foods such as molasses, olive oil, butter, cheese, yeast powder and whiskey. For her voyage on May 15 1875, for example, "City of Peking" carried 23,476 quarter sacks of flour, 2,193 packages of shrimp, plus meal, abalone, bread, codfish, salmon and mineral water in addition to a range of hardware items.
Cargoes imported typically included items such as silk, tea, sugar, rice, hemp, spices and opium, although again food tended to dominate. To pay for these goods, one of the ship's most valuable exports was "treasure", which could sometimes be as much as a million dollars or more in coins or bullion.
All the ships of Pacific Mail were manned by Chinese crews but commanded by American or European officers. Chinese employees were willing to work for half the wage of Westerners—$15 a month as opposed to $30—and they lacked union protection. However, their employment also meant language difficulties and it was not unusual for officers and crew to be forced to resort to communication by sign language.
Incidents and accidents.
The Chinese and Japanese immigrants brought to the United States on the "City of Peking" came via the port of San Francisco, where they were obliged to undergo a period of quarantine before entering the country. The quarantine period was served on board aging, unseaworthy hulks in the harbor that were leased by the company, and this arrangement occasionally led to problems. On March 4 1888, a violent gale blew up after passengers had been transferred from "City of Peking" to the hulk "Alice Garrett", which then broke its moorings with the passengers still on board. Drifting helplessly in high waves, the hulk was swamped and quickly sank. Fortunately, no lives were lost, but the passengers lost all their belongings which went down with the ship. On an earlier occasion, in January 1880, Chinese immigrants from "City of Peking" were blamed for an outbreak of smallpox in the city, but a more likely cause was the fraternization of the ship's Caucasian officers—for whom quarantine restrictions were less diligently policed—with the local citizenry. 
Another accident involving "City of Peking" occurred in Hong Kong on November 29 1886, when the vessel rammed a French passenger ship, the "Saghalien", causing severe damage. Both vessels survived the encounter.
"City of Peking" usually made the voyage from Yokohama to San Francisco in about sixteen days, but on one occasion the vessel took almost twice as long. The ship left the Port of Yokohama on January 10 1893. After she was almost a week late in arriving, concern increased to the point that the steamship "San Juan" was dispatched to Honolulu with relief supplies, intending to trace the route of the missing vessel. However, "City of Peking" finally arrived unassisted, thirteen days late. It transpired that she had broken a propeller shaft and been forced to revert to her auxiliary sails, but since she had been carrying only enough sail for two of her four masts, progress had been unusually slow.
Spanish-American War.
When the Spanish-American War broke out in late April 1898, the U.S. government quickly moved to charter a number of commercial vessels for service as naval auxiliaries. On May 1 1898, a few days after the declaration of war, "City of Peking" was chartered by the U.S. government for service as a troop transport, at the rate of $1,500 a day.
On May 13, the 49 officers and 979 men of the First California Volunteer Regiment boarded the "City of Peking", on their way to Manila in the Spanish colony of the Philippines. The historic moment was captured by the Thomas A. Edison Company on one of the earliest surviving film reels. The ship was accompanied on her voyage by the "City of Sydney" and "Australia", which jointly carried five companies of the regular 14th Infantry and 22 officers and 699 men of the Second Oregon Volunteer Regiment. 
After a stopover of several days at Honolulu, the small convoy was joined by the protected cruiser , which was to provide the armed escort to Manila. The Captain of "Charleston", Henry Glass, had been ordered to take the surrender of Guam, which was achieved peacefully in late May. The convoy then proceeded on to Manila Bay, arriving 30 June.
After disembarking the troops, the small convoy waited several weeks before returning to San Francisco via Nagasaki. "City of Peking" arrived back at San Francisco with ten sailors and some naval officers on 22 August. On September 1, the ship was handed back to Pacific Mail.
On her next voyage however, loaded with 3,000 barrels of beer intended for the Philippines' occupation troops, "City of Peking" suffered a mechanical breakdown off Lime Point, and for the only time was unable to complete a scheduled transpacific crossing. She was towed back to port and the problem eventually diagnosed as a broken piston follower.
Retirement.
After repairs, "City of Peking" resumed service on her regular San Francisco-Hong Kong route, which continued for another five years. On 21 September 1903, the aging vessel was finally retired from transpacific service by Pacific Mail. The ship was eventually scrapped sometime after 1909.

Monika Ertl

Monika Ertl (August 7, 1937 – May 12, 1973), the daughter of the cameraman Hans Ertl, was a member of the armed political underground movement in Bolivia.
Biography.
Ertl was born 1937 in Munich. After World War II her father emigrated to Bolivia, where he continued to film for some time and became a farmer. 
Monika Ertl came to Bolivia in 1952 when her father brought the family over from Germany. In Bolivia she accompanied her father on several filming expeditions and learnt to use both a film camera and firearms. Later she entered a marriage briefly, but felt unhappy playing the "trophy wife" of a Bolivian-German mining engineer. After her divorce she became involved with the survivors of Ché Guevara's routed guerrilla. After helping out in minor occasions she finally joined the political underground. In Germany, she became known as "Che Guevara's avenger" because of her alleged involvement in the murder of Colonel Roberto Quintanilla Pereira in Hamburg, Germany: although this has never been completely proven it can safely be assumed that she did shoot Quintanilla who, at the time, was serving in Hamburg as the Bolivian consul. A former leader of the ELN, Osvaldo "Chato" Peredo, confirmed in an interview filmed by Gernan director Christian Baudissin in 1988 that Quintanilla was a prime target of the Bolivian ELN, because he had been responsible for ordering the hands of Guevara be cut off and sent to La Paz for further identification. He also states that Ertl "after carrying out the mission in Hamburg" returned to Cuba where she met with Régis Debray. 
After being under covert observation for several days she and another guerrilla were eventually ambushed and killed by Bolivian security forces on May 12, 1973 in El Alto/La Paz where she was reorganizing the ELN. According to Régis Debray she was also preparing the abduction of the former Gestapo Chief of Lyons Klaus Barbie to bring him to Chile and consequently to justice in France where he was wanted as a Nazi war criminal. At the time Barbie was known to be an adviser of the secret police in Bolivia. Her body was not turned over to her family to be buried and she rests in an unknown grave.

SS City of Tokio

SS "City of Tokio (sometimes spelled City of Tokyo") was an iron steamship built in 1874 by John Roach & Sons for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. "City of Tokio" and her sister ship "City of Peking" were at the time of construction the largest vessels ever built in the United States, and the second largest in the world behind the British leviathan .
Like "Great Eastern", construction of the two Pacific Mail ships was to be plagued with financial difficulties, which threatened to bankrupt the shipbuilder. Unlike "Great Eastern", however, which was a commercial failure, "City of Tokio" was to enjoy a successful commercial career until being wrecked at the entrance of Tokyo Bay in 1885. 
"City of Tokio" holds the distinction of being the first ship to bring members of the "Issei", or first-generation Japanese migrants, to the United States.
Construction.
"City of Tokio" and "City of Peking" were ordered by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company in order to take advantage of a new $500,000 congressional subsidy for the company's steam packet service to the Far East. After contracting with the shipyard of John Roach and Sons for construction, Pacific Mail ran into financial difficulties after two company directors squandered the company's cash reserves in a stock speculation scheme and then fled the country with the balance.
Pacific Mail's woes were exacerbated after the stock speculator Jay Gould, in a clandestine attempt to acquire the company's stock cheaply, persuaded the U.S. Congress to rescind its $500,000 annual subsidy. Pacific Mail's inability to meet its financial obligations threatened in turn the survival of the shipbuilder John Roach and Sons, which had already invested more than a million dollars in constructing the two ships, but Roach was able to hold off his own creditors. Roach eventually renegotiated the Pacific Mail contract, reducing the latter's monthly obligations from $75,000 to $35,000, and the two vessels were launched in 1874.
Service history.
Maiden voyage.
On her maiden voyage in February 1875, "City of Tokio"'s sister ship "City of Peking" lost propeller blades, and also required the replacement of 5,000 rivets, amounting to a total repair bill of $300,000. When "City of Tokio" made her own maiden voyage in April of the same year, she too suffered the loss of propeller blades.
The problems were eventually diagnosed as improper loading of the ships combined with weak wooden decks. The wooden decks on both vessels were subsequently replaced by iron, after which both established an enviable record of reliability.
Route, cargo and passengers.
Like her sister ship "City of Peking", "City of Tokio" was utilized exclusively on the Far Eastern steam packet service, operating from the Port of San Francisco to Yokohama, Japan and Hong Kong. Both vessels transported Chinese, and later Japanese, migrants to the United States, as well as exporting foodstuffs and manufactured goods and importing a range of goods including silk, tea, hemp, spices and opium.
President Grant's world tour.
In 1877, United States President Ulysses S. Grant embarked on a highly successful world tour, during which he was greeted at every port of call as the hero of the recently concluded Civil War.
Grant departed the United States on the first leg of his tour on May 17, 1877 on the American Line's "Pennsylvania" class steamship "Indiana". He returned home almost two and a half years later on board "City of Tokio", arriving at San Francisco on September 20, 1879.
A contemporary account described the arrival thus: 
A fleet of steamers and yachts met the "City of Tokio" down the bay, while guns boomed until the harbor was cloudy with smoke, bells rang, and factory whistles tooted and screamed. Every vantage point overlooking the channel was black with cheering crowds.
It was dusk when the General landed. A great procession was awaiting him, and escorted him, through streets draped with bunting and bright with thousands of lights and bonfires, to the Palace Hotel, where a chorus of five hundred voices sang an ode of greeting.
Cheered by crowds at every station, Grant eventually reached Philadelphia, his original point of departure two and half years earlier, on December 12, 1879.
Japanese migrants.
After the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed in 1882, American industrialists began to look elsewhere for reliable sources of cheap labor. The Japanese government had forbidden emigration since 1868, but in the 1880s it relaxed some of its restrictions. In 1884, the government of Hawaii offered to subsidize the transport of Japanese labourers to its territory, and advertised a set of conditions under which the migrants would be employed on its sugar plantations.
On February 8, 1885, the first group of 943 Japanese — 676 men, 159 women, and 108 children — arrived in Honolulu, on board "City of Tokio". This group was the very first in the wave of immigration whose members would later be dubbed "Issei", or first-generation Japanese migrants to the United States.
Shipwreck.
"City of Tokio"'s service was to end prematurely. In the early hours of 24 June 1885, in conditions of poor visibility, "City of Tokio" was grounded on rocks at the entrance to Tokyo Bay. At first it seemed as if the ship could be refloated, but the onset of a typhoon rendered salvage impossible, and the storm damaged the ship beyond repair. Fortunately, all of the passengers and some of the cargo were safely removed before the vessel foundered.

728th Military Police Battalion

The 728th Military Police Battalion performs Military Police operations to allow US forces to move through an assigned area. The 728th Military Police has four line companies, and two Detachments, the 39th MP Det. and the 13th MP Det. The 728th Headquarters is located at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. The Battalion works in support of Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment (HHD) and the soldiers assigned to it.
History.
The 728th was activated 19 January 1942, at Fort Custer, Michigan. The primary mission of the 728th was at first the training of men for combat and maintaining alert status for the protection of war production industry in Detroit, Michigan. During the Detroit race riot the 728th helped maintain security in Detroit. On 28 October 1946, after the cessation of World War II hostilities, the 728th was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for its valiant performance of duty during the period 1942 through 1945. From 1946 until 1950 the 728th remained stateside where its mission was focused on maintaining domestic security in various areas in the United States. Soon thereafter the battalion was transferred to Yokohama, Japan. When North Korea invaded South Korea and the United States began their intervention the 728th was reassembled in Pusan, South Korea. Their new mission was operation and maintaining traffic on the Green Diamond Main Supply Route (MSR). During the next eight months, many soldiers of the unit took active part in combat to suppress guerrilla activities and respond to ever changing battles. At some point after the “MacArthur Invasion” the Battalion Headquarters was transferred to Incheon, South Korea. As security conditions in the Korean theater improved the battalion headquarters was again transferred, this time to Seoul. In 1951 the Battalion began assisting in traffic control and other civil law enforcement duties. The unit was a major participant in the Korean War until the signing of the in 1953.
Since the end of Korean War the mission of the 728th has been to provide Military Police support to the U.S. troops around the Republic of Korea and to maintain order in the assigned area. The 728th Military Police Battalion missions have included providing security for the return of hostages of the USS Pueblo and maintaining security in support of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.
Activities in Iraq.
On 21 October 2004, two platoons of the 728th MP Battalion (70 personnel) deployed to Iraq in support of the United States mission in the Iraqi War. The 57th Military Police Company at Camp Carroll in Waegwan, and the 552nd Military Police Company at Camp Hialeah in Pusan, each supplied 35 troops for this deployment. Prior to their departure, the troops received two weeks of Iraq-specific combat training which included how to deal with roadside bombs and other improvised explosive devices; and information on the culture and peoples of Iraq. “This redeployment does not represent the start of a trend of sending soldiers from the peninsula South Korea to Southwest Asia,” Maj. Kate Johnson, an 8th U.S. Army spokeswoman in Seoul, stated. “Our mission is the deterrence on the peninsula, and remains deterrence on the peninsula.” This assignment was expected to last at least six months, after which, the troops would return to their duties in Korea.
On 10 December 2007, the 728th MP Battalion took over the duties of the 97th Military Police Battalion in Iraq. These duties include helping to educate and train the Iraqi Police in all operations and policing tactics.

List of locations in the Port of London

This is a list of about 680 former or extant wharves, docks, piers, terminals, etc. of the Port of London, the majority of which lie on the Tideway of the River Thames, listed from upstream to downstream.
Many of the docks closed after the mass uptake of containerisation changed the face of the industry and bringing about an end to an era, and a demise to the occupation of the docker as it then was.
Those marked with a † have at present the status of a safeguarded wharf. Those in "italics" are no longer used for port or river transit related activities. Further remarks are made in brackets, including in some cases the present operator or cargo handled.
In 1937 at the height of London's trade it is estimated that there were around 1700 wharves between Brentford and Gravesend. Today there are around 70 active terminals, each generally handling much greater volumes. Much of the cargo and commodities handling by the Port of London takes place in the downstream stretches of the Thames beyond Greater London, on the banks of south Essex (Thurrock) and north Kent. The Port of London Authority controls operations from its base in Gravesend. The main container terminal is currently at Tilbury, though in 2008 construction began on the London Gateway project, which will become the largest single component of the Port of London when completed.

Alonso de Reinoso

Alonso de Reinoso (or Reynoso) (1518–1567) was a Spanish Conquistador in Honduras, Mexico, Peru and Chile. He was born in Torrijos Toledo, Spain in 1518. He was married to Catalina Flores de Riofrío before he came to the Americas in 1535.
He first disembarked in Cartagena de Indias in Colombia but soon moved on and fought for twelve years in Honduras and the Yucatán with Pedro de Alvarado and Francisco de Montejo and was one of the first Alcaldes of the new city of Mérida. Leaving Mérida he went to fight in Peru for two years until he met Francisco de Villagra who was recruiting more men for Pedro de Valdivias campaign in Araucanía. 
In 1551 he came to Chile with Francisco de Villagra. An experienced soldier he soon be became Corregidor of the city of Angol in 1554 after the death of Valdivia. Francisco de Villagra then appointed him as Maestro de Campo for his army in 1554. After fighting in the Battle of Marihueñu, he survived the defeat and evacuation of Concepcion. Returning to Santiago, he supported Villagra against the attempt of Francisco de Aguirre to become governor of Chile. 
Under the new governor García Hurtado de Mendoza Reinoso was made a Captain of Cavalry and fought in the Battle of Lagunillas and Battle of Millarapue. Moving into the Tucapel region he broke up an assembly of Mapuche in Cayucupil with a night march and morning surprise attack. Soon afterward near the valley of Purén, Reinoso rescued a column under Pedro de Avendaño from a Mapuche ambush. 
Mendoza appointed him as the Corregidor of his new town of Cañete de la Frontera when he bagan his expedition to the south. Attempting to throw off the Spanish occupation Caupolicán attacked the fort of Cañete expecting the gates to be opened by the treachery of a yanacona within but he was betrayed instead. Reinoso took advantage of the opportunity to lure the toqui Caupolican into a trap in the city and destroyed his army. 
Later Reinoso found an Indian who led his subordinate Pedro de Avendaño into the mountains during the night and on February 5, 1558, captured Caupolican. Returned to Cañete Reinoso saw to the Toqui's execution by impalement. This measure did not stop the Mapuche revolt and they fortified Quiapo. Mendoza returned and with Reinoso captured the fort and destroyed the army defending it in the Battle of Quiapo. Afterward Reinoso carried out the punishment of the prisoners taken in the battle, seven hundred were hanged without mercy on the battlefield.
In the middle of January 1559, Alonso de Reinoso was elevated to the rank of Maestro de Campo by Mendoza who left him in charge of all the troops south of the Bio Bio River. From 1559 he lived in the city of Concepcion where he was named as its Cabildos Alcalde Ordinario and its Corregidor. He continued as the Maestro de Campo for Mendoza's successor the new governor Francisco de Villagra. 
He died, drowned in a shipwreck near the city of Concepcion in 1567, escorting the new "oidores" of the new Real Audiencia of Chile to the city.

Phan Thanh Giản

Phan Thanh Giản (November 11, 1796–1867) was a Grand Counsellor at the Nguyễn court in Vietnam. He led an embassy to France in 1863, and committed suicide when France completed the invasion of Southern Vietnam (Cochinchina) in 1867.
Phan Thanh Giản's grandfather was an ethnic Chinese (with ancestry from Fujian Province in China), while his grandmother was a Hoa woman.
Life.
Treaty of Saigon.
Phan Thanh Giản was one of the foremost mandarins of the Nguyễn court. He played a key role in negotiating the Treaty of Saigon with the French in 1862. The negotiations led to the formal cession of Vietnamese territory that the French Expeditionary Corps had occupied in 1861 (the first parts of the future colony of Cochinchina): the provinces of Già Dinh, Mỹ Tho, Bien Hoa, and the Poulo Condore islands were ceded, and war reparations paid to the French.
Because of his role in these negotiations, Phan Thanh Giản became rather unpopular, both with the Vietnamese population, and with the court of king Tự Đức.
Embassy to France (1863).
In 1863, Phan Thanh Giản was sent by the king on an embassy to France to visit Napoleon III, in order to negotiate the return of the territories given to the French. Phan Thanh Giản was accompanied by Michel Duc Chaigneau (the son of Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau) on this embassy. Phan Thanh Giản with a 70-strong embassy met with Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie in November 1863. Napoleon III, moved by Phan Thanh Giản's plea, accepted to return the provinces in exchange for a war indemnity, an agreement to station troops in Saigon, My Thau and Thủ Dầu Một, and recognition of French military protection. The French Navy Minister Chasseloup-Laubat however, opposed to the return of Cochinchinese territory, threatened Napoleon III with his resignation and that of the whole cabinet, forcing him to order the cancellation of the agreement in June 1864
Through his visit to France, Phan Thanh Giản obtained a first hand understanding of the level of advancement of France compared to Vietnam, was astonished at examples of technological innovation such as steam trains, and stated on his return to Vietnam that France's "wealth and strength are beyond description". Tự Đức only responded to this warning with admonitions of moral rectitude:
Governorship.
Upon his return, Tự Đức nominated Phan Thanh Giản governor of the remaining southern provinces. When France invaded the rest of the southern territories in 1867, Phan Thanh Giản chose to avoid armed resistance and failed to defend the citadel of Vĩnh Long, waiting for orders that never came, resigned from his position and took his own life through poisoning.
Family.
Phan's family was of Sino–Vietnamese descent. His grandfather, Phan Thanh Tap was a native of Haicheng (near modern day Longhai, Fujian) in Zhangzhou prefectrure of Fujian province at the beginning of the 17th century due political sentiments against the ruling Qing government. Phan Thanh Tap migrated to Vietnam in the early 18th century, along with his family and relatives and settled in the village of Hoi Trung at Bình Định Province. Upon settling in Vietnam, he married a Vietnamese woman, Huynh Thi Ngoc, with whom his Phan's father, Thanh Ngan was born from this union. Phan Thanh Ngan began his career as a clerk to the Nguyễn court. In 1798, Phan Thanh Ngan was appointed as the chief supplier for Phuc Anh's (Emperor Gia Long from 1802) navy and was sent on a diplomatic mission to Tourane, but was later shipwrecked at lost at sea.
Phan's mother was also of Chinese descent; her great-great grandfather migrated to Vietnam from Fujian province during mid 17th century. He had three sons, Phan Thanh Liem, Phan Thanh Tong and Phan Thanh Huong, of which the first two organised an armed rebellion against the French soldiers who had colonised Vĩnh Long and were later captured and killed.
In popular culture.

Canadian Radio-Television Commission

The Canadian Radio-Television Commission came into being as a result of federal government legislation enacted in 1967 and coming into force in 1968. It was the culmination of more than 30 years of wrangling amongst radio and television broadcasters, their stakeholders, and politicians, and it has since become the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.
Many committees and commissions had been struck by Canada's Parliament since 1928 to address the issues of radio, and eventually television, broadcasting. During the period 1936 to 1958 the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was both the national broadcaster and regulator of other broadcasting undertakings. Being both a broadcaster and regulator was seen as a conflict of interest and the Board of Broadcast Governors was created to oversee the regulatory side of the broadcasting industry. Even the BBG had problems with political gerrymandering and, eventually, in 1965, the Fowler Committee was struck to see if anything could be done to remove political clout from the regulatory process. Fowler noted in his report that the Broadcasting Act of 1958 gave only five words of instruction to the CBC as to its mission. The CBC was charged with "operating a national broadcasting service" and, Fowler continues, "this is all the guidance given to those charged with the responsibility for administering the public broadcasting agency. If this interpretation has failed to conform to the wishes of Parliament, it is clear where the responsibility rests." 
The final document prior to the creation of the CRTC was the White Paper produced by the Standing Committee on Broadcasting, Films, and Assistance to the Arts and released in March 1967. The paper made several points.
• First, there were problems with the regulatory structure. The powers of the BBG were ill-defined and the role of the CBC was unclear.
• Second, the Committee rejected the Fowler proposal that the CBC and the BBG be reconstituted as one board.
Finally, the Paper made an explicit mention that the "Canadian broadcasting system, comprising public and private sectors, must be regarded as a single system which should be regulated and controlled by a single independent authority." This was in direct contradiction to the thoughts of Alphonse Ouimet who, in particular, had been urging for years that the Government give "de jure" recognition to the fact that Canada had a dual system of broadcasting and also in contradiction to Dr. Stewart, who felt that the regulator was to be formally acknowledged as the regulator of the private sector only.
This contradiction of thoughts was a repetition of the contradictions incurred in the development of broadcasting policy over the forty years from 1928 to 1968. The government's first broadcast venture, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Corporation, was created by a Conservative government; dismantled by a successor Liberal government and replaced with a much stronger and more effective operating body, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The first separate regulatory body, the Board of Broadcast Governors, was created by a Conservative government; dismantled by a successor Liberal government and replaced with a much stronger and more effective regulatory body, the Canadian Radio-Television Commission.

John Bernhard

John Bernhard (born May 17, 1957, Geneva, Switzerland) is a Swiss American artist and photographer best known for his surrealist nude studies. Rather than merely showing women’s bodies, Bernhard overlaid elements of the earth through projections and worked with myths of metamorphosis as a subtext for his model photography. The resulting images include allusions to the material by which the models are absorbed or into which they disappear. His work was included in the 120 year survey of the nude exhibition “Body Work” at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, alongside the work of Edward Weston, Bill Brandt, Eadweard Muybridge, E. J. Bellocq, and Edward Steichen. Bernhard later continued to devote all his energy taking photographs and bringing them together to enhance their meaning with visual interplay. This is evident in his “Diptychs” and sequencing series “Drift”. He was profiled in the documentary show “Temps Present” on Swiss Television TSR (Switzerland) and the global network TV5 Monde. His work is widely published and exhibited throughout the U.S. and Europe. His photographs are collected by many museums including the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Akron Art Museum, Ohio; Denver Art Museum; Musée de l'Élysée, Site officiel Lausanne, Switzerland; Museet for Fotokunst, Site officiel Denmark; the New Mexico Museum of Art; Polk Museum of Art, Florida and the Swiss National Library, Bern. His work was shown in 2004 as a major mid-career retrospective exhibition at the Musee des Suisses dans le Monde in Geneva. John Bernhard lives and works in Houston, Texas.

Groovin' Blocks

"Groovin' Blocks" is a puzzle video game for Wii by Empty Clip Studios. It was released in North America on September 8, 2008 as a downloadable WiiWare game. It also released as an expanded retail of the game in North America on August 11, 2009. The game was later released for the iPhone OS platform and on PlayStation Network on March 18, 2010.
Gameplay.
"Groovin' Blocks" is a falling block-type puzzle game with gameplay that has been likened to "Columns" and "Lumines". The game sees players having to clear lines of three or more blocks of the same color, and like "Columns" players can cycle through the falling lines of blocks, with adjacent blocks of the same color also disappearing with the matched lines. In addition, extra points can be scored when players bring their falling blocks down to the downbeats (called "Superbeats") of the game's electronica soundtrack, adding to a score multiplier. 
By setting high scores, players collect stars to unlock new songs and power-ups. Unlike most puzzle games which are played to infinity, each stage in "Groovin' Blocks" lasts for the duration of the song if the player has not yet failed the stage by filling their play area with blocks.
The game also features offline two player competitive and co-operative modes, as well as an option for colorblind players that turns the different colored blocks into shapes.
Reception.
IGN gave "Groovin' Blocks" a 7.6/10, calling the game a fun "one trick pony" and a "pretty impressive" first effort from the developers. Siliconera called it "a deceptively addictive, fun little gem" that is "a great hybrid of the puzzle and music genres".

Reception.
Released on August 29, 2008, the film opened to good reviews. "Rediff.com" thought that Chakravarthy fared better as an actor than as a director. While continuing in its discussion, it specifically commends Jagapathi Babu and Mahesh Manjrekar for their performances. The female actors, Mamta Mohandas and debutant Madhurima were added to the glamor quotient. Another such review equally praised Babu and Chakravarthy for their histrionics. While discussing the technical aspects of the film, the reviewer thought that Chakravarthy "scripted the screenplay with perfection and did not lose grip on the story at any point of time." From certain scenes and filming methodology, another review thought that Chakravarthy's direction was influence by his mentor Ram Gopal Varma. While the music was termed as tasteless, cinematography and editing were acceptable by the reviewer. Overall, the film was rated as hit and the review suggested that its plot was inspired by the 2002 Hong Kong crime thriller "Infernal Affairs" (which this movie was remade as 2006 Hollywood movie, "The Departed", directed by Martin Scorsese). Director Chakravarthy corroborated this fact in an interview where he said that the movie The Departed (remade based on the original Infernal Affairs) was inspiration to some extent, but his film varied a lot in its narration and treatment.

MyPods and Boomsticks

"Mypods and Boomsticks" is the seventh episode of the twentieth season of "The Simpsons" and first aired on Fox, November 30, 2008. Homer becomes suspicious of Bart's new Muslim friend, Bashir, and decides to invite his family for dinner; having offended them, Homer goes to their home to apologize but discovers what he believes to be a terrorist plot to blow up the Springfield Mall. Homer immediately goes on a rampage through Springfield to warn the residents about the impending disaster. In the episode's subplot, Lisa gets her very own MyPod (a parody of iPod). It was written by Marc Wilmore and directed by Steven Dean Moore with Shohreh Aghdashloo of "24" guest starring as Bashir's mother, Mina. The episode was largely known for being the first episode of "The Simpsons" to have Islam portrayed in a large role.
Plot.
During a trip to the mall, Lisa obtains a "MyPod" from Krusty at the Mapple Store. After Bart interrupts an important message from Mapple founder Steve Mobbs, insulting "Mapple's" user base, he runs into a Muslim boy from Jordan named Bashir and befriends him. After meeting Bashir, Homer is impressed by the boy's manners, but Lenny, Carl and Moe convince him that all Muslims are terrorists. He invites Bashir's family over to dinner in an attempt to expose them, but openly discriminates. Offended, they leave. Later that evening, while going to their home to apologize, Homer catches a glimpse of Bashir's father working with TNT in his garage; due to a nightmare featuring the Genie of "Aladdin" in which he transforms Homer's "decadent, Western society" into a stereotypical Islamic republic, he decides to eavesdrop on Bashir's parents talking about Bashir's father's job in building demolition, but misses part of the conversation and thinks that Bashir's father is a suicide bomber. As soon as the father departs for work, Homer convinces Bashir's mother to invite him in for a proper pardoning of his dinner prejudice. In reality, he hacks into the family's laptop and discovers a diagram of demolition plans for the Springfield Mall.
He rushes to the Springfield Mall to warn the shoppers (except Patty and Selma), and sees Bart standing near a detonator with Bashir and his father. Homer tries to get rid of the dynamite by throwing it into the river, but it blows up a bridge which leads to the Duff Beer brewery. It actually turns out that the old mall was slated for destruction, which the city council wanted, while the bridge leading to the brewery was supposed to open the next day. Realizing his mistake, Homer apologizes, and the Simpson family throws a "Pardon My Intolerance" party for Bashir's family. Meanwhile, Lisa becomes obsessed with her new MyPod until she gets a US$1200 "MyBill". She goes to Mapple's undersea headquarters and begs Steve Mobbs to consider a reduced payment plan. Steve Mobbs offers Lisa a job at Mapple to help with her bill. Much to her chagrin, Lisa is given a job where she must stand on a street corner dressed as a MyPod, handing out Mapple pamphlets and telling people to "Think Differently."
Cultural references.
The episode features numerous parodies of Apple Inc. and its products. Apple is portrayed as Mapple, with the MyPod, MyPhone, MyTunes, MyCube, Mapple Store and Brainiac Bar referring respectively to the iPod, iPhone, iTunes, Power Mac G4 Cube, Apple Store and Genius Bar. Later episodes of the show also feature a MyPad, a reference to the iPad. The CEO of Mapple is Steve Mobbs, a parody of Apple Inc.'s then-CEO Steve Jobs. The scene where Comic Book Guy throws a sledge hammer at the screen is a reference to the famous "1984" Apple commercial.
The scene where Homer is on a flying carpet is a parody of the film "Aladdin"; the Genie also makes an appearance. "The Simpsons" regular Dan Castellaneta does the voice of the Genie in this episode. He had previously performed the Genie's voice in the "Aladdin" television series, "The Return of Jafar", and the "Kingdom Hearts" video game series. Steve Mobbs operating a series of holographic screens with his hands is a reference to the 2002 film "Minority Report".
The episode features Minnie Riperton's song "Lovin' You" and Miles Davis' "Moon Dreams", while the episode's "Itchy & Scratchy" cartoon features Ludwig van Beethoven's "Symphony No. 5" and the Alicia Bridges song "I Love the Nightlife".
Reception.
The episode was generally praised by critics. Robert Canning of IGN praised the episode; as a whole, he called the episode funny and strong and "gave the now familiar 'suspected terrorist' plot a Simpsons twist," but called the remainder of the Mapple storyline less impressive. Canning ends his review by saying that minus Lisa's involvement after act one, it was a decently funny episode of "The Simpsons". He gave the episode a rating of 7.6/10. Daniel Aughey of TV Guide also praised the episode for its jokes but lack of flow, calling it "one step behind". "Entertainment Weekly"'s Five Best TV quotes of the week includes Bart's line of "Wow, all these years I've been patting lambs when I should have been shoving them in my mouth."
The Council on American–Islamic Relations praised the episode and sent a commending letter to Matt Groening. Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the council in Los Angeles, wrote "I applaud your effort in Sunday's episode of 'The Simpsons' to humanize American Muslims by challenging anti-Muslim sentiment in our society. [...] By introducing a professional Muslim family, the 'Mypods and Boomsticks' episode highlighted the diverse make-up of Springfield and brought to light how Americans can work toward mutual respect and inclusion by getting to know their neighbors." During the episode, Homer mistakenly calls God (Allah) "Oliver", and the Islamic holy book (the Qur'an) "the Corona". A spokesperson for Britain's Islamic Cultural Center and London Central Mosque commented on the episode before it aired, telling the U.K. tabloid "The Daily Star", "I hope Muslims take no notice of the show."<ref name="Oliver/Corona"/> Creator Groening defended the episode by saying, "Cartoons deal in stereotypes. We try to be sensitive."<ref name="Oliver/Corona"/>

Pedro Teotónio Pereira

Pedro Teotónio Pereira (Lisbon, Mártires, November 7, 1902 – Lisbon, February 14, 1972) was a Portuguese Politician and Diplomat.
Background.
He was a son of João Teotónio Pereira, Jr. (Lisbon, 1869 - Lisbon, São Domingos de Benfica, 1948), Administrator of the Companhia de Seguros Fidelidade, and wife Virgínia Hermann von Boetischer (Lisbon, Santa Engrácia, 1871 - Lisbon, 1969), paternal grandson of João Teotónio Pereira (1832–1916) and wife Clara Sobral (1840 - Freixo de Espada à Cinta, Fornos, 1910) and maternal grandson of Maximilian August Hermann von Boetischer, an Engineer, linked to the installation of the telephones in Portugal, and wife Maria José da Silva. His older brother Luís Teotónio Pereira was also a Politician.
Career.
He considered himself a «faitheful servant of Salazar».
He was one of the main builders of the «corporativist politics» of the Portuguese Estado Novo. Subsecretary of State (1933–1936) and Minister of Commerce and Industry (1936–1937), he was appointed by António de Oliveira Salazar Special Agent of Portuguese government near Franco's government during the II World War.
The Aristides de Sousa Mendes affair.
Pedro Teotónio Pereira, then Portugal's Ambassador to Spain, was reported by Consul Machado, subordinate in Bayonne of the Portuguese Consul in Bordeaux Aristides de Sousa Mendes, of the taken over his responsibilities from him there in order to set up a second assembly line to process thousands more exit documents. Teotónio Pereira, whose maternal grandfather was German, who favored Germany and worried that accepting those unacceptable to Hitler would ruin Portugal's relationship with Franco, promptly set out for the French border.

Charlotte Guillard

Charlotte Guillard (died 1557) was the first woman printer of importance. Guillard worked at the famous Soleil d’Or printing house from 1502 until her death. Annie Parent described her as a "notability of the Rue Saint-Jacques", the street where the shop was located in Paris, France. She became one of the most important printers of the Latin Quarter area in the city of Paris.
Biography.
Early life.
Guillard was very likely born in the late 1480s in Paris, France. Her name is sometime spelled "Guillart" and in Latin books as Carola Guillard. Her parents were Jacques Guillard and Guillemyne Saney. The professions of her parents are unknown, nor is recorded their social status. The family’s exact place of residence is not known. They had many connections with the province of Maine in France. She could very well have been born there instead of Paris. Guillard had at least three and possibly four sisters and one brother.
Mid life.
Guillard showed interest in the printing business as early as 1500 when she was still a teenager. Guillard first married Berthold Rembolt in 1502. Her first husband worked with the earliest French printer Ulrich Gering. Their printing business went so well that they eventually took over a small hotel that housed their family and employees. Rembolt died in 1519.
Paris businesses and crafts in the sixteenth century were regulated by the guild system. Normally women were not allowed to own a business, however they were allowed by these guilds to take over the business of their husband after their death. Guillard took over management of her husband's print shop after his death. She took on the duties of proofreading the Latin publications. Her works were recognized for their beauty and accuracy. In fact she built up such a good reputation of accuracy that she was commissioned by the Bishop of Verona to publish his works. She was often associated with Guillaume des Boys, her brother-in-law.
Later life and death.
In 1520 Guillard married Claude Chevallon, a bookseller who also printed theological books. From this time forward, Guillard was known as "Madame Chevallon." Thereafter, Madame Chevallon ran his printing business on her own. She probably died in 1557. 
More than 400 different libraries worldwide have books printed by Guillard. There are over 200 different publications by Guillard available worldwide.

Battle of San Roque

The Battle of San Roque was part of the Argentine Civil War. It was fought on the Primero River, near the city of Córdoba, Argentina, on 22 April 1829. The Federalist forces of Córdoba Province governor Juan Bautista Bustos were defeated by the Unitarian forces of General José María Paz. As a result of his victory, Paz assumed the office of provincial Governor.
Prelude.
General Bustos had governed Córdoba since the days of the Arequito Revolt, in 1820. His confrontation with Paz, who had fought with him in the revolt, had started a few months earlier: Paz thought Bustos had betrayed the rebel group, not carrying his army to the seat of the independence war in Upper Peru.
After a lacklustre career in Salta Province, Paz had made a name for himself in the war with Brazil, where he was promoted to the rank of general after the Battle of Ituzaingó. He then declared himself to be against the Buenos Aires governor Manuel Dorrego who had been forced to sign a peace treaty with the Empire of Brazil which granted the independence of Uruguay and its separation from the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. Paz supported the a revolution against Dorrego, organized and fought the forces of Juan Lavalle.
As Lavalle had not been able to vanquish the dissidents in his province, Paz gathered his troops in the interior of the country and marched north, with the excuse of returning his men to their provinces. Instead, he reached Córdoba's provincial capital city, where he demanded Bustos's resignation, whose mandate had expired, and wanted to elect a new governor (the provincial constitution had term limits and prohibited a third mandate), while everybody at the time knew that Paz had in mind to be a candidate himself.
Paz attacked Córdoba with his powerful army, but Bustos escaped to a ranch at San Roque, in the foothills near the city. Bustos tried to negotiate an agreement by which neither would be the new governor. Paz disagreed, and broke relations, accusing Bustos of delaying tactics while awaiting reinforcements. Bustos had sent a message to Juan Facundo Quiroga, the caudillo and militia commander in La Rioja Province, asking for help.
Battle development.
Before Bustos could receive reinforcements, Paz advanced towards San Roque. Bustos made a last effort, sending his son-in-law Arredondo to negotiate peace. Paz attacked without answering. It is possible, judging by the lack of movements or preparations on the part of Bustos, that Arredondo had not yet arrived with a response, so the federalist commander would have thought they were still within a period of truce. Paz's behavior the next year at the Battle of Oncativo supposes this was the case.
Bustos was not very experienced in battle, and the few he had won were from defensive positions. He therefore just waited for the unitarians, protecting his position with artillery. Paz simply divided his forces and commanded his lieutenants to just walk over anybody on their front. The order was followed in each of his groups, after a severe bombardment over the federalist positions by commander Arengreen's artillery. The divisions commanded by Román Deheza, Gregorio Aráoz de Lamadrid and Juan Esteban Pedernera displaced the enemy's forces before them with ease.
The federalist troops, on their side were severely affected by the unitarian bombardment, and after the capture of their artillery and heavy loses of their men, they simply ran. The unitarian cavalry slaughtered the running enemy causing miore than 100 dead in a few minutes. In a little more than a half hour of combat, Bustos ordered a retreat of his remaining forces.
Consequences.
Bustos was forced to leave, running for refuge within Quiroga's troops, therefore abandoning his province. Only a month later, Bustos and Quiroga tried again for revenge: invaded the province of Córdoba, occupied most of the western hills and marched on the provincial capital. They confronted Paz at the Battle of La Tablada but ultimate victory was again on Paz's side.
Córdoba province remained under Paz's and unitarian control, joined with the federalists that had left Bustos plus the young class of city lawyers and merchants. He then set to make at least a tacit alliance with the unitarian governments of the provinces of Tucumán and Salta, and after the next battles he could formalize the Unitarian League (a.k.a. "Liga del Interior")
San Roque was the first of four battles commanded by general Paz. He won all four decisively, distinguishing himself as the best Argentine general of the time.
The Battle of San Roque's field is today under the waters of San Roque Lake, near today's city of Villa Carlos Paz.

Maltese Church, Vienna

The Maltese Church ( (full name - Church of Saint John the Baptist) is a Roman Catholic Gothic church of the Knights Hospitaller in Vienna, on Kärntner Straße in the 1. Wiener Gemeindebezirk Innere Stadt.
The first church on this site is mentioned in 1217, as a "House of the Prueder of the Order of Saint John", a commandry to care and support crusaders. The current building was built in the mid 15th century. In the 17th century it was a favoured preaching location for Abraham a Sancta Clara. This building was rebuilt to fit contemporary taste in the Baroque era and in 1806, and the Kommendenhaus (1839) and parts of the church (1857) had stained glass added during the 19th century. The Order ran into financial trouble after the First World War and in 1933 had to sell the church and the Johanneshof, and the church was given over to other uses within a historical preservation order. It was bought back in 1960 and restored in stages in 1968, 1972 and 1983-84, finishing with a general restoration in 1998.
The church's high altarpiece was painted in 1730 by Johann Georg Schmidt.

White lias

White lias is a rare, fine-grained form of limestone from the late Triassic period, occurring only in certain parts of Somerset and infrequently in Warwickshire. It gets the name ‘lias’ from the quarrymen’s dialect for ‘layers’, referring to its natural state when quarried. 
White lias is part of the Penarth Group, a multi-layered bed of stone formed from shale and limestone. At its base is a bone-bed yielding ancient marine, reptilian and ammonite fossils. 
White lias varies in colour from white-cream to pale grey and is traditionally used for building and flooring. Evidence of its use can be seen in manor houses, churches and cathedrals all over the UK. It is most prevalent in the Somerset towns of Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Langport and Wincanton. 
Bowdens quarry in Langport is presently the only supplier of white lias, as well as the more commonly found blue lias and grey varieties.

Beryozovskaya GRES

Beryozovskaya GRES is a coal-fired power plant near the town of Sharypovo in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia. The installed capacity of the plant is 1,600 MW.
Its flue gas stack is tall and the tallest free-standing structure in Russia outside the Moscow area. It is also the fourth tallest chimney in the world.
General information.
The primary role of the power plant is to provide extra electricity for the Russian power grid during winter, when electrical demand peaks. In other seasons the average load of "Beryozovskaya GRES" is below half of its capacity since the Central Siberian region uses several more efficient hydro power plants. The production cost for one kilowatt-hour by station is close to 0.01 USD, the annual production reaches values above 10,000 GWh in some years.
The lignite used by the power plant belongs to Kansk-Achinsk basin with total reserves 600 bln t, one third of it is available for surface mining. The plant consumes coal-field with proved reserves 3,7 bln t, which is as close as 14 km away. The transportation of this fuel from pit to thermal station goes through transporter line, which is capable to transfer up to 40 mln t of coal annually.
The production grows last years and there is plans to develop station adding new generators. The power plant also performs centralized heat supply. For self-cooling purposes it uses reservoir, which holds back the river Beresh (Chulym basin), instead of applying a cooling towers.
History.
According to original soviet project the final installed capacity of the power plant should be 6,400 GW with eight 800 MW generators. The construction of Beryozovskaya GRES began in 1970, its first two generators was commissioned in 1990. Mounting of the chimney was completed in 1985, its height is 370 m.
Present activities.
As of 2010 year, the power plant is undergoing modernization program, which must improve efficiency and output of existing generators. According to plans of OGK-4, capacity of station will raise to 1,600 MW in 2011. Also construction of third unit with 800 MW continues and should be accomplished in 2014. Company develops network of pipelines in the region for centralized heat supply to localities around.

__NOTOC__
The Curtiss XF15C was a mixed-propulsion fighter prototype of the 1940s.
Development.
By the late 1940s, the United States Navy was interested in the mixed-power concept for its shipborne fighters - i.e. aircraft with a mixture of propellor and turbojet engines, such as the FR Fireball. As such, an order was placed with Curtiss on 7 April 1944 for delivery of three mixed-power aircraft, designated the F15C. Powered by both a 2,100 hp (1,566 kW) Pratt & Whitney propellor engine, and an Allis-Chalmers J36 turbojet, the aircraft was in theory the fastest fighter in the US Navy at that time.
Operational history.
The first flight of the first prototype was on 27 February , without the turbojet installed. When this was completed in April of the same year, the aircraft flew several mixed-power trials, however on May 8 it crashed on a landing approach. The second prototype flew for the first time on 9 July, again in 1945, and was soon followed by a third prototype. Both aircraft showed promise, however by October the Navy had lost interest in the mixed-power concept and cancelled further development.

The Schueberfouer starts on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday before Saint Bartholomew's day (24 August) and closes on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday before 12 September in order to last 20 days every year. In 2010, the fair comprised 184 attractions including 27 major rides, 13 children's rides and 54 restaurants and snacks bars. In 2007 the fair attracted over 2 million visitors.
History.
John the Blind, King of Bohemia and Count of Luxembourg, founded the Schueberfouer on 20 October 1340. The founding document stated:
Even today, it remains linked to St Bartholomew's day, 24 August, the traditional opening date. 
The name "Schueberfouer" is thought to originate from the name of the market place where it was first held: the "Schuedburg", today's Plateau St Esprit. For almost 450 years, it was indeed just a large market for everything from food and livestock to cloth and pottery. The fair moved to the Glacis in 1610 after the Limpertsberg wood had been removed to improve the city's fortifications. During the 18th century, shows and games became part of the fair but it was not until the 20th century that a Ferris wheel and a rollercoaster first appeared.

"When The Boat Comes In" (or "Dance Ti Thy Daddy") is a traditional English folk song, originating in North East England.
It was popularised as the theme tune to the 1970s BBC drama serial "When The Boat Comes In" in an arrangement by the composer David Fanshawe.
The song was also used in the TV advertisement for Young's fish, Sea to Plate campaign.
Dance to your Daddy, my little laddy
Dance to your Daddy, my little man
Thou shalt have a fish and thou shalt have a fin
Thou shalt have a codlin when the boat comes in
Thou shalt have haddock baked in a pan
Dance to your Daddy, my little man
Dance to your Daddy, my little laddie
Dance to your Daddy, my little man
When thou art a young boy, you must sing and play
Go along the shore and cast your shells away
Build yourself a castle, watch the tide roll in
Dance to your Daddy, my little man.
Dance to your Daddy, my little laddie
Dance to your Daddy, my little man
When thou art a young man, go unto the trades
Find yourself a skill, and wages you’ll be paid
Then with all your wages, buy yourself some land
Dance to your Daddy, my little man
Dance to your Daddy, my little laddie
Dance to your Daddy, my little man
When thou art a man and go to take a wife
Find yourself a lass and love her all your life
She shall be your wife and thou shalt be her man
Dance to your Daddy, my little man
Dance to your Daddy, my little laddie
Dance to your Daddy, my little man
When thou art an old man, father to a son
Sing to him the old songs, sing of all you've done
Pass along the old ways, then let his song begin
Dance to your Daddy, my little man

Agnes McLaren

Agnes McLaren (4 July 1837 – 17 April 1913) was a respected Scottish doctor who was the first to give medical assistance to women in India who, because of custom, were unable to get medical help from male doctors.
Background.
McLaren was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. The daughter of Duncan McLaren, a Presbyterian businessman and politician, she entered the school of medicine at the University of Montpellier in 1876, eventually becoming only the tenth woman in Britain to graduate as a doctor. By 1882, she was a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, and set up a practice in Cannes around 1879.
India.
In 1899 she converted to the Roman Catholic Church, and went to India with a Catholic mission, where she learned of the tremendous health needs of women in India. Because of India’s custom of seclusion for women ("purdah"), they could not be seen by men other than their immediate family, a custom which meant they also could not receive medical care from male physicians. With so few women doctors in the early 1900s, literally thousands of women died in illness or in childbirth each year and many babies also died in infancy. McLaren responded to this problem by establishing the Medical Mission Committee in London, which financed the opening of a small hospital, St. Catherine’s Hospital, in Rawalpindi, a particularly needy area.
During her search for women who could help run the hospital, McLaren discovered that Catholic Canon Law prohibited Religious Sisters from giving this level of medical care. She petitioned the Holy See to lift the restriction and, while waiting for a response, continued looking for women interested in health care abroad. Anna Maria Dengel, an Austrian, responded to McLaren’s request, but was never able to meet McLaren, who died shortly after their correspondence began. However, before her death, McLaren encouraged Dengel to study medicine at the Cork University, setting into motion Dengel’s becoming a physician and, years later, her starting a new religious congregation, the Medical Mission Sisters. They are a Catholic congregation of Sisters who are trained as doctors and nurses and other forms of healthcare professionals, dedicated to providing healthcare to women and children around the world. 
McLaren died in 1913 and was buried in Antibes, France.

The Suplacu de Barcǎu Viaduct is a future viaduct between Suplacu de Barcău and Borş 90% built, and then abandoned by the American company Bechtel, on the route of the future A3 Transylvania Motorway.
Suplacu de Barcău viaduct is the largest structure along the length of the Transylvania Motorway and will be, once completed, the largest viaduct in southeast Europe. The viaduct will be a traditional piled structure with a length of 1.8 km (1.1 mi) and 45 spans of 40 m (131 ft).
To build this structure will require 88,000 m3 (115,000 yd3) of concrete, 6.5 tonnes of reinforcement steel, and 1.3 tonnes of stressing cable, 360 pre-cast U-beams each weighing 160 tonnes. Construction work at the viaduct is underway and includes foundation activities, piling installation, reinforcement of concrete pile caps, pier elevations and pier heads. The next phase of construction will involve the U-Beam installation and afterwards, once the U-beams are installed, the placement of the deck slab. Finally, when the deck is completed, the paving activities will be ready to start.

Anna Maria Dengel

Mother Anna Maria Dengel, S.C.M.M., (16 March 1892-17 April 1980) was an Austrian physician, Religious Sister and missionary. She was the founder of the Medical Mission Sisters, which was among the first congregations of Religious Sisters authorized by the Roman Catholic Church to provide full medical care to the poor and needy in the overseas missions.
Biography.
Early life and education.
Anna Maria Dengel was born 16 March 1892, in Steeg, Austria, to Edmund Wilhelm Dengel and Maria Gertrud (Scheidle) Dengel. Anna had four brothers and sisters, and four half-brothers and sisters. After her mother died when Anna was nine, she was enrolled in the boarding school of the Visitation monastery in Hall in Tirol. After completing her schooling there, she was offered a position to teach German in Lyons, France. Dengel accepted the offer and taught there for two years before returning home to Austria.
Career.
When Anna Dengel was in her mid-20s she heard that a Scottish physician and Catholic missionary, Agnes McLaren, was looking for women doctors for a hospital in Rawalpindi, India (now Pakistan), which had been established to provide medical care for the Muslim women of the region who were barred from care by male physicians. She was overjoyed and immediately wrote to McLaren of her interest, and a lively correspondence between them began. McLaren was already in her mid-70s at this time, however, and died before she and Dengel could meet, but Dengel followed the course of preparation for her mission in India which she and McLaren had set. Dengel took McLaren’s advice to attend medical school at University College in Cork, Ireland. In 1919, after graduating, she went to England for a nine-month internship. The following year she left for Rawalpindi to continue the work that McLaren had begun.
For four very difficult years, Dr. Dengel struggled to make an impact on the health care of the women and children in northern India. She became convinced that many more professionally trained and spiritually dedicated women were needed in order to effect real healing among the people. So she set out for the United States to seek help.
Foundation of the Medical Mission Sisters.
Dengel spent months of travel and meetings to make the needs of India known, including discussions with the Reverend Michael A. Mathis, C.S.C., and other Catholic priests, bishops and cardinals, about how best to meet these needs. She encountered the same barrier which her mentor, McLaren, had in her own pioneering service in healthcare to the women and children of Muslim India, namely, the prohibition in Church law barring members of religious institutes from practicing medicine.
After this experience, Dengel came to the conclusion that she needed to establish a new religious congregation dedicated to the cause. She drew up a Constitution for the congregation she had in mind and wrote that the members were “to live for God…to dedicate themselves to the service of the sick for the love of God and …to be properly trained according to the knowledge and standards of the time in order to practice medicine in its full scope, to which the Sisters were to dedicate their lives.”
Permission was granted on 12 June 1925 to begin the new congregation, and on 30 September that year the “First Four”--Anna Dengel along with Johanna Lyons, M.D., of Chicago, Evelyn Flieger, R.N., originally from Great Britain, and Marie Ulbrich, R.N., of Luxemburg, Iowa—came together in Washington, D.C., to found the Society of Catholic Medical Missionaries.
The “First Four” were unable to profess canonical vows because the Catholic Church had yet to approve the practice of medicine by Religious Sisters, yet they lived as Sisters just the same. Lifting this restriction had been a goal of Dengel's mentor, Agnes McLaren, who had petitioned the Vatican to have Church authorities do so. Finally, in 1936, after the Medical Mission Sisters had grown, the Catholic Church approved Sisters’ working in medicine and all of its branches and recognized the women as a religious congregation, now known as the Sisters of the Catholic Medical Missions. The members of the Medical Mission Sisters then made their first public vows and Sister Anna Dengel was elected the first Superior General.
Death and afterward.
Mother Anna died in Rome, Italy, on 17 April 1980, and a Mass of the Resurrection was celebrated for her at the Campo Santo in the Vatican on 21 April. Her body was buried in the Teutonic Cemetery (reserved to natives of Germanic nations serving the Catholic institutions of Rome), which is within the territory of Vatican City.

Priscilla Leung Mei-fun (Chinese:梁美芬; born 18 November 1960, Hong Kong) is a Legislative Councillor, representing the Kowloon West constituency since 2008. She is also a member of Kowloon City District Council. She is a barrister and an associate professor at the City University of Hong Kong's School of Law where her husband is the Dean.
LegCo member.
Leung was supported by the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government and the pro-Beijing Federation of Trade Unions in her bid for a Legco seat. She blamed that she was on being an independent and not a Beijing loyalist. But she supported the government's bill in most of the period. 
During her LegCo election campaign, she staged a publicity stunt of catching rats in Yau Tsim Mong District, earning her the nickname "Queen of Rats" .
Leung is a social conservarive, she is extremely opposed to Same-sex marriage and rejected all rights to the gay couples.
Controversies.
On 13 January 2010 she walked out from the LegCo chamber after fellow legislator Albert Chan had said "some people teach dog shit laws" ("教狗屎法律") in an apparent reference to Leung. Chan refused to withdraw his comment and LegCo president Tsang Yok-sing subsequently ruled that no LegCo rules had been violated.
On 21 January 2010, in a response to the quasi-referendum on universal suffrage which was triggered by the resignation of five pan-democracy members of LegCo, Leung announced she would introduce a private member's bill which would forbid legislators from resigning unless they became ill or were convicted of a crime. Ronny Tong criticised her move as a contravention of the Basic Law: he said such a bill would infringe the right to stand for elections protected under Article 26 and would be inconsistent with Article 74 which prohibits individual legislators from tabling bills that relate to the political structure. She also went on record stating that the resignations of the five legislators contravened the Basic Law of Hong Kong. However, in spite of her background as a teacher of constitutional law, she failed to substantiate her claim. 
On 25 January 2010, she stated that the LegCo resignations were a form of abuse, although such resignations are common in many parliamentary democracies. She also stated that amending the relevant legislation to prevent those who resigned from running in by-elections would put Hong Kong in line with practice in Britain. However, as the 2008 resignation and subsequent re-election of the former Chairman of the Conservative Party, David Davis, shows, quasi-referendums are perfectly legal in Britain.

1954 FA Charity Shield

The 1954 FA Charity Shield was the 32nd FA Charity Shield, a football match between the winners of the previous season's First Division and FA Cup titles. This year's match was contested by league champions Wolverhampton Wanderers and FA Cup winners West Bromwich Albion. 
The two Black Country rivals had been the main contenders for the league championship of the previous campaign, with Wolves edging out their challengers by four points in the end to claim their first ever league title. Albion had gained some consolation in winning their fourth FA Cup. 
The match was held at Wolves' stadium, Molineux, in keeping with the trend of using the league champions' home that had been established at the turn of the decade. It was staged on an "international week" during the season, which caused several players – most notably, Wolves' captain Billy Wright – to miss the game as they were on duty with their national sides. 
The hosts led the contest both 2–0 and 4–2, but were twice pegged back by rapid-fire replies. The game eventually ended 4–4, meaning the Shield was shared for the second time in its history.

Lord Kingsland said: 
On the substance of the matter, as your Lordships are well aware, jury trial has been a central component in the conduct of all serious criminal trials for about the past 700 years. Its contribution to the preservation of the liberty of the individual, and to the legitimacy of Government, is quite incalculable.

Thomas White (1667–1732)

Thomas White (1667 – 30 September 1732) of Tuxford was the son of John White of Tuxford and Jane, daughter of Sir Thomas Williamson, Bt.. He was a substantial landowner in Nottinghamshire, owning the Manor of Tuxford, which had been in the family for several generations by this time.
He was the man responsible for the family eventually settling at Wallingwells – the result of losing his way one night. White was on his way home from a journey and had hoped to make the final leg of the trip to Tuxford from Sheffield in one evening. He was on horseback, followed by his servant and baggage. The land between Sheffield and Tuxford was in those days unenclosed and the roads were little more than packhorse tracks. Thomas lost his way in the darkness, but happened to stumble upon an ancient moated house, which had formerly been a nunnery. The house was owned by Richard Taylor, a captain in the Nottinghamshire Militia, MP for East Retford and lately High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire. Taylor put White up for the night and showed great hospitality to him.
Richard Taylor was married to Bridget, daughter of Sir Ralph Knight of Langold and Warsop – a famous and prominent person during the Civil War and the restoration of the monarchy. They had a sole daughter, Bridget, who was then aged 16 years. Thomas White was 31 years old at this time. Following the accidental meeting of White and the Taylor family, Thomas White regularly repeated his visits and became good friends with the Taylors and eventually Thomas White married Bridget Taylor at Carlton Church on 28 July 1698. Through this marriage to the heraldic heiress, the estates at Wallingwells and Buerly (Pately Bridge) were added to Thomas’s already considerable holdings, as Richard Taylor died in the spring of 1699, and Thomas and Bridget inherited his possessions. They decided to move into Wallingwells at this time, making it their home and seat.
Thomas White was described by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (his third cousin) as a jovial countryman. He was MP for East Retford (most of which belonged to him) in many Parliaments of King William and Queen Anne’s reigns and was a Deputy Lieutenant for Nottinghamshire. In 1717 Thomas was appointed Clerk of the Ordnance of the Tower.
Thomas and Bridget had five children:
Thomas White died suddenly of an apoplectic fit at Wallingwells on 30 September 1732 aged 63 years. He is buried under the High Altar in Tuxford Church. His widow Bridget continued to live at Wallingwells until her death on 17 January 1761.

Ausable Club

__notoc__
The Ausable Club, in St. Huberts, New York, is the name of a club and the clubhouse of the Adirondack Mountain Reserve (AMR), which upon the initiative of William George Neilson, formed in 1887 to save the lands around Beede's Hotel from lumbering. The Reserve once owned most of the Adirondack High Peaks. The club is also the home of the Adirondack Trail Improvement Society, known as A.T.I.S, which developed and still maintains many of the trails to the high peaks. The clubhouse property, also known as St. Hubert's Inn, Beede House, or Beede Heights Hotel, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Club members have included Harvard president James Conant, clergyman Henry Sloane Coffin, aeronautical engineer Jerome Hunsaker, painter Harold Weston, and US Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who blazed a trail up nearby Noonmark Mountain that is still in use.
Certain Easement Trails on AMR/AC lands are open to the public, with restrictions, and provide access to many of the High peaks trails: Basin Mountain, Mount Skylight, Mount Marcy, Mount Haystack, Mount Colvin, Nippletop Mountain, Dial Mountain, Lower Wolfjaw Mountain, Upper Wolfjaw Mountain, Armstrong Mountain, Gothics, Sawteeth, Saddleback Mountain, Noonmark Mountain, Round Mountain, and Rainbow and Beaver Meadow Falls.
History.
The present clubhouse sits on the site of Beede's Hotel, built in 1876. Beede's was one of the first of the Adirondack hotels to cater to wealthy sportsmen eager to escape city life during the summer, a phenomenon that predated the Civil War, but that was greatly accelerated by advances in transportation offered by steam ships and railroads. Beede's was notorious for its austere accommodations, but no less famous for its setting near Upper and Lower Ausable Lakes and the Ausable River, and for its views of Giant and Noonmark Mountains, Sawteeth and Mount Colvin. Guides were available to lead parties up the rocky ravine of the Ausable to lean-to shelters on the lakes, and thence to the high peaks above.
When it became known that the woods around Beede's was going to be timbered by the lumber company which owned them, a prominent Philadelphia mining engineer and summer resident William G. Neilson, secured a two month option on the property dated September 20th 1886. Neilson approached several friends to join in the purchase of , including the two lakes and nearby mountains. By December 1st 1886, William Neilson, William Alderson, George Burnham, Charles Hinchman, J.W. Fuller, Richard Dale and Edward Howell successfully raised the down payment to secure a two year warranty deed which was signed by Neilson and Alderson. By October of 1887, twenty-nine stockholders had formed a corporation, the Adirondack Mountain Reserve. Although the Reserve prohibited hunting and camping, the land remained open to the public for hiking. The AMR added to its holdings, reaching a peak of in 1910. However, in 1933 and again in 1978, land was sold to the state of New York as part of the Adirondack Park, so that present holdings amount to about .
In 1890, the owners of the Reserve formed the Keene Heights Hotel Company, with a plan to purchase Beede's Hotel, but the building burned to the ground in March. Philadelphia architectural firm Wilson Brothers & Company was hired to design St. Hubert's Inn, and four months later the new hotel was opened in the present structure. However, by 1904, the venture proved unprofitable, and was closed. The following year, the AMR's owners formed the Ausable Club, and purchased the hotel property as a clubhouse.
The clubhouse.
The clubhouse is a -story clapboard building with sparing use of Queen Anne details, arranged in two long blocks joined at a 22.5 degree angle where a large 3-story octagonal porch provides sheltered access to the surrounding views. In addition, a porch runs the full length of the first floor. Protected by its status as a clubhouse, the building has suffered remarkably little change, inside or out, since it was built.

List of British finalists at Grand Slam tennis tournaments

Despite being the founders of the sport of tennis, Britain has not enjoyed much success in the four Grand Slams, the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. The most recent winner was Andy Murray, who won the 2013 Wimbledon title against Novak Djokovic. The last woman to win a major was Virginia Wade, who won Wimbledon in 1977.
The greatest British tennis player was Fred Perry who won three of the four majors in 1936. He is easily Britain's most successful player ever, the only one to have won all four Grand Slams. 
This table lists British Grand Slam singles tennis finalists. Competitors normally only competed in their home countries in the early years of the championships, and British players always won the men's tournament at Wimbledon until 1906, and the women's tournament until 1905.

Melkorka

Melkorka is the name given in "Landnámabók" and "Laxdœla saga" for the Irish mother of the Icelandic goði Ólafr Höskuldsson. According to "Laxdœla saga", Höskuldr purchased Melkorka, who he believed to be a mute thrall-woman, from a Rus' merchant on Brännö while on a trading expedition to Norway, and made her his concubine while away from his wife Jórunn Bjarnadóttir. When Höskuldr returned home to Iceland, he took her with him. Despite Jórunn's irritation, the concubine was accepted into Höskuldr's household, though he remained faithful to Jórunn while in Iceland. The following winter the concubine gave birth to a son, to whom they gave the name Ólafr after Höskuldr's uncle, Olaf Feilan, who had recently died. "Landnámabók" mentions that Höskuldr and Melkorka had another son, Helgi, but he does not appear in "Laxdœla".
According to "Laxdœla saga", Ólafr was a precocious child, and could speak and walk perfectly by the age of two. One day Höskuldr discovered Ólafr's mother speaking to her son; she was not, in fact, mute. When he confronted her she told him that she was an Irish princess named Melkorka carried off in a viking raid, and that her father was an Irish king named "Myrkjartan" (Muirchertach). Shortly thereafter squabbling between Jórunn and Melkorka forced Höskuldr to move his concubine and his son by her to a different farm, which thereafter was known as Melkorkustaðir.
Around 956, Ólafr, at Melkorka's urging, decided to go abroad to seek his fortune. Melkorka taught Ólafr Irish Gaelic and urged him to visit her family. Höskuldr was opposed to the expedition and would not provide trade wares, and the property of Ólafr's foster-father Þórðr was mostly in immobile goods and land. In part to arrange financing for his expedition, his mother Melkorka married Þorbjörn skrjúpur ("the Feeble"), a farmer who had previously assisted her in the management of Melkorkustaðir. Melkorka and Þorbjörn had a son named Lambi.
Ólafr visited Ireland, where he met Melkorka's father and kinsmen. Ólafr remained with Myrkjartan for a time, and the king, according to "Laxdœla saga", even offered to make Ólafr his heir. Ólafr, however, ultimately returned to Norway, afraid of provoking Myrkjartan's sons.
Media.
Melkorka is featured in the 2007 young adult novel "" by author Donna Jo Napoli. The novel depicts how she became a slave and why she decided to remain mute. The novel ends as she is being taken to Iceland by Höskuldr.

FetLife

FetLife is a social networking website that serves people interested in BDSM, fetishism, and kink. On its homepage, FetLife describes itself as, "Similar to Facebook and MySpace but run by kinksters like you and me." FetLife distinguishes itself from competitors by emphasizing itself as a social network rather than a dating site.
History.
FetLife was launched in January 2008 by John Baku, a software engineer in Montreal, Quebec. Frustrated by attempts to find women who had the same sexual interests as he did, Baku created a website in 2007 called “FriendsWithFetishes”. While working on release 2.0 of FriendsWithFetishes, Baku decided to launch it as a separate site and named it FetLife.
In 2012, FetLife found itself at the center of a controversy regarding its policy that users pledge not to "make criminal accusations against another member in a public forum," which many of its users object to on the basis that it prevents them from warning other users of alleged rapists, murderers, and sexual predators who frequent the site.
Features.
Members may create a personal profile and list which fetishes they are "into" or are "curious about." The search feature is deliberately limited to prevent members from finding users with specific characteristics, such as age, sex, or location. Members can also upload pictures and videos, including sexually explicit ones often rejected by other sites. They can write journal entries (called Writings), and send and receive private messages (called Conversations) with other members. Users can create "fetishes" both for genuine and satirical purposes.
Groups on FetLife are subject categories in which users may start Discussions. Members must join the particular group in order to comment on "Discussion" threads. Events are listings of in-person events such as conventions, workshops, parties, and meetings to which members can RSVP as going or maybe going.
Members may report illegal content as well as terms of use violations to the administrators of FetLife.
Criticism.
An account is required to view content on FetLife, although since membership is free, the level of privacy offered by the site is minimal. In practice, this means the site is not indexed by search engines and, partly because of this, critics have argued that FetLife presents itself as being more private than it is.
Technology.
FetLife runs on a custom nginx variant of the Ubuntu/Debian distribution of GNU/Linux; it was adapted from the brightbox version.

The Sanford-Wang parameterisation is an empirical formula used to model the production of pions in nuclear interaction of the form p+A → formula_1+X where a beam of high-energy protons hit a material.
Its formula for the double-differential cross section with respect to momentum (p) and solid angle (formula_2) is as follows.

Sir Thomas Woollaston White, 1st Baronet

Thomas Woollaston White (died 28 October 1817) was the eldest son and heir of Taylor and Sarah White. Prior to inheriting his father’s substantial estate and fortune, he occupied himself primarily with the army and militia. In 1789 he was a lieutenant in the 4th Light Dragoons.
When it appeared that an invasion of England by Napoleon was imminent Thomas twice raised, quartered, fed, clothed and armed a force of volunteers to help defend the nation. King George III heard of these deeds and offered to share half of the cost from his privy purse, as he saw this as too much a burden for a private gentleman to bear. Thomas declined His Majesty’s generous offer, saying that he considered it the duty of every loyal gentleman to assist to the utmost of his means at such a crisis. He was subsequently rewarded by the King with a Baronetcy being conferred upon him on 20 December 1802. Thomas was subsequently known as Sir Thomas White, Bt. of Tuxford and Wallingwells.
When the corps was raised, a barrack was erected in Wallingwells Park. Some trees still stand which formed the corners of it. An oak tree is also shown at the side of the drive to Langold, in which a platform was erected. On this a sentry was posted day and night to watch for the lighting of the beacon on Gringley Hill, near Gainsborough, as a signal of the landing of the French. Two horses in the stable were kept constantly saddled, in readiness to send out to assemble the men. When the French camp at Boulogne was broken up and all fear of an invasion was past, the English Government decided to test through some part of the country the popular feeling, and to see whether there would be a general rising of the people. With this object they caused several beacons to be lighted, amongst which was Gringley. The alarm soon spread; the men of Sir Thomas’ regiment assembled at Wallingwells at once, and were marched to Doncaster, the place of rendezvous. Here they learnt that the French had not landed, and after Sir Thomas had treated them to breakfast and given them a guinea a piece - he dismissed them to their homes.
The corps raised by Sir Thomas eventually became what is today known as ‘S’ Squadron (Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry Cavalry), The Royal Yeomanry.
Sir Thomas was at the same time Colonel of the 3rd Nottinghamshire Militia.
As well as his military life, Thomas was a keen sportsman and kept a substantial stable and hawking establishment at Wallingwells. These met most days of the week and his house was renowned for its hospitality.
On 3 January 1801 Thomas married Elizabeth Blagg, daughter of W. Blagg of Tuxford. They had 11 children, of whom 7 died young.
Sir Thomas died of heart disease after an hour’s illness on 28 October 1817. He was buried in the new vault in the White Chapel at Tuxford Church. His widow, Elizabeth lived until her death on 16 July 1850 at Tuxford Hall.

Lily Gower

Lily Gower, birth name Lilias Mary Gower (5 October 1877 — 29 July 1959) was a Welsh croquet player, a four time winner of the Women's Championship. She was one of the three women who have won the Open Championship, winning in 1905.
She had won her very first public tournament at Budleigh Salterton, in 1898 and won the Ladies Championship for the next three years. In 1901, she started entering tournaments with men and in that year she won the Open Gold Medal, with a controversy. In semi-final her opponent (a man) accused her of "spooning". This sparkled heated discussions as to whether this was a gentlemanly way to do. 
During her peak she was also three times Open Gold Medalist (contestants being both men and women) and even Men's Gold Medalist. The latter case was a result of confusion in rules: after "Open" and "Women's" were renamed into "Men's" and "Women's", the inadequately modified rules contained a loophole which allowed women to enter the "Men's Gold" contest. 
In 1906 she married Reginald CJ Beaton, who was also a leading croquet player.
As an administrator she served on the Council of the Croquet Association between 1939 and 1954.

His part in the plot was to have been a minor one whereby he was to have arrange the robbery of the Exchequer to provide finance for the plotters to pay for the army of exiles and mercenaries they were attempting to bring over from the Continent. White became frightened as time went on, and confessed to Cardinal Pole all he knew. The plot was foiled. As a reward for his loyalty, White was rewarded by the gracious gift of four estates from the Queen. The estates were: Cotgrave, Notts., and Preston, Stone, and Kynwadeston, in Somerset. "In consideration," so runs the Originalia Roll, 3 and 4 Phil, and Mary, "of good and faithful service by our beloved servant, Thomas White, gentleman, in that late conspiracy against us, our crown and dignity attempted not long since by Henry Dudley and his accomplices." Thomas’s wife is called Agnes Cecil throughout this grant.
In addition to these manors and his Collingham property, Thomas possessed the manor of Ruddingston, Notts.; lands at Holbich, Lincoln; Stilton, Hunts.; and the estate of Woodhead, in Rutland. In 1560, he purchased the greater part of the remaining portion of the manors of Tuxford, and his son, Sir John White, completed the acquisition of the whole. Thomas White died on 26 October 1580, and is buried with his wife (who survived him) in the smaller of the two vaults of the White’s mortuary chapel on the north side of the Church of St. Nicholas, Tuxford.

William R. Boggs

William Robertson Boggs (March 18, 1829 – September 11, 1911) was a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He was noted as a civil engineer who constructed the military fortifications that protected some of the Confederacy's most important seaports.
Early life and career.
Boggs was born in Augusta, Georgia. Comparatively little is known of his early youth, but it is known he studied at the Augusta Academy. Two of his brothers would also serve in the Confederate Army. They spent their summers at the Sand Hills near what is now Summerville, South Carolina, a popular tourist resort. At the age of twenty in July 1849, he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point as a cadet from Georgia. He graduated four years later among the first five in his class. Among Boggs' classmates were James B. McPherson, Philip H. Sheridan, and John M. Schofield, later Union generals, and John B. Hood of the Confederate service.
On graduation he was brevetted as a second lieutenant and assigned to the Topographical Bureau. He spent some time in the office of the Pacific Railroad Surveys. In 1854 he was transferred to the Ordnance Corps and was made assistant at the Watervliet Arsenal in Troy, New York. In December of the same year he became second lieutenant and in 1856 he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. While at Watervliet Arsenal, on December 19, 1855, he married Mary Sophia, daughter of Col. John Symington, the commandant. To them were born five children–William R., Jr., a mining engineer who was murdered in Mexico in 1907; Elizabeth McCaw, John Symington, Edith Allston,and Henry Patterson Boggs. (For some unknown reason a sixth child, Archibald Boggs (1860–1881) was omitted from the biographical data published for General Boggs.)
In 1857 Boggs was transferred to the Louisiana Arsenal at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In 1859 he became inspector of ordnance at Point Isobel, Texas. On December 14, 1859, he took part in an engagement with Cortino's Mexican marauders near Fort Brown, for which he was given honorable mention by General Winfield Scott. Soon after, he was transferred to the Alleghany Arsenal at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to which his father-in-law Colonel Symington had also been assigned.
Civil War service.
Boggs resigned from the U.S. Army the very day that the Georgia Convention adopted its ordinance of secession. However, his father-in-law stayed in the Federal service. Early in the war, Boggs was appointed by Governor Joseph E. Brown as the purchasing agent to procure arms, ammunition, and supplies for Georgia's state troops. Later, in the Provisional Confederate Army, Boggs' duties were again as an engineer and ordnance officer, given primarily to staff duty for such officers as Braxton Bragg. He was never given the command of troops in combat, although he commanded all engineers and artillery in Pensacola, Florida. His major accomplishments were to perfect and complete fortifications and supply depots in 1861 (including the defenses of Charleston, South Carolina, and Pensacola); to engineer Kirby Smith's invasion of Kentucky in 1862; and to assist Smith's military administration west of the Mississippi River from 1863 to 1865.
In 1862, he was appointed Colonel, Chief Engineer of the State of Georgia. In recognition of his efforts in constructing the fortifications that defended Savannah, Georgia, one of the earthworks was named Fort Boggs. During the Kentucky campaign, Colonel Boggs, by then back in the Confederate national service, won the confidence of his superiors. On General Kirby Smith's recommendation, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and became Chief of Staff under him in the Trans-Mississippi Department in the spring of 1863. Late in the war, Boggs resigned after a quarrel with Smith. For a short time thereafter, he commanded the District of Louisiana, but was soon superseded by Brig. Gen. Harry T. Hays and he subsequently awaited orders at Shreveport, Louisiana.
Early in 1865 he enlisted in an expedition to enter military service in Mexico. Finding that the purpose of its leaders was to fight for Maximilian, rather than Juarez, he withdrew his name and returned to the Confederate army. With the collapse of the Confederate armies in the East, Kirby Smith moved his headquarters to Houston, Texas. The surrender of his army was made by Smith's subordinates, in which General Boggs participated, the parole of Boggs being dated June 9, 1865.
Postbellum career.
After the war, Boggs engaged in the profession of engineering, participating to a great extent in railroad construction in the West. In 1875 he was appointed Professor of Mechanics in the Virginia Polytechnic Institute at Blacksburg, a position he held until a reorganization of the faculty in 1881. One of his colleagues wrote, "He was highly valued by his associates as a man of force and culture; was esteemed by the student body as an attractive and honest teacher; by the people of the community as an upright, genial, agreeable gentleman. Politics was alone responsible for his removal." 
The later years of his life were spent in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where he died at the age of eighty-two. He was buried in Salem Cemetery.
One of his nephews, Major Archibald Butt, perished in the sinking of the British cruise liner, RMS "Titanic".

1920 Open Championship

The 1920 Open Championship was the 55th Open Championship, held 30 June to 1 July at Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club in Deal, Kent, England. George Duncan erased a 13-stroke deficit after 36 holes to win his only major title, two strokes ahead of runner-up Sandy Herd, the 1902 champion. Due to World War I, it was the first Open in six years, the last was played in 1914.
Herd and Ted Ray, the 1912 winner, shared the first round lead after each opened with 72 on Wednesday morning. Both faltered in the afternoon's second round while Abe Mitchell shot a 73 for a 147 to open up a six-stroke lead over Herd and Jim Barnes after 36 holes. Ray was eight back, Len Holland 11 behind, while Duncan was 13 back after consecutive rounds of 80 for 160. Duncan played himself back into contention with a 71 in the third round on Thursday morning. Mitchell began that round with three bogeys, made a seven at the 5th hole, and finished with an 84. After 54 holes, Holland was at 229 and led by one over Herd and Barnes, with Mitchell and Duncan two back. Duncan carded a final round of 72 to finish at 303 total. Holland and Barnes both shot 79 for a 308 and 309, respectively. Mitchell rebounded with a 76 which left him at 307. Only Herd could match Duncan's score, but he found trouble on the 16th and settled for a 305, two strokes back of Duncan.
Six-time and defending champion Harry Vardon, age 50, finished at 318, fifteen strokes back in a tie for fourteenth place.
Two future champions from the United States, Walter Hagen and Scottish-born Tommy Armour, both made their Open Championship debuts this year and both finished at 329, 26 strokes back in a tie for 53rd.
Armour was an amateur at the time.
This was the second and final Open Championship held at Royal Cinque Ports, which also hosted in 1909. Near the English Channel, the course is directly south of Royal St George's, which became the sole Open venue in southeastern England in the course rota. An exception was in 1932, when Prince's Golf Club hosted its only Open. All three courses are adjacent, with Prince's the furthest north.

1921 Open Championship

The 1921 Open Championship was the 56th Open Championship, held 23–25 June at the Old Course at St Andrews in St Andrews, Scotland. Former local Jock Hutchison won his only Open Championship, in a 36-hole playoff over amateur Roger Wethered. It was Hutchison's second and final major title.
During the first round, Hutchison made a hole-in-one at the 8th and then drove the green at the par-4 9th, his ball settling inches from the hole. He finished with a round of 72 and a two-shot lead. By the end of the third round, however, he trailed Jim Barnes by four shots. Wethered, a student at Oxford, carded a 71 in the final round to finish at 296, while Hutchison shot 70 to tie and force a Saturday playoff. Wethered almost did not make it to the playoff, as he was scheduled to play for his cricket team that day and had to be persuaded to stay and play golf. In the end, the playoff was anti-climatic as Hutchison prevailed by nine shots.
Although a native of St. Andrews, Hutchison had become a United States citizen and is thus credited as being the Open's first American champion. The following year, Walter Hagen became the first U.S.-born winner. Bobby Jones, 19, played at St. Andrews and the Open for the first time, and was the low amateur after 36 holes. He withdrew in the third round after taking four shots to get out of a bunker at the 11th.

The 1922 Open Championship was the 57th Open Championship, played 22–23 June at Royal St George's Golf Club in Sandwich, England. Walter Hagen became the first American-born winner of the Open Championship, one stroke ahead of runners-up Jim Barnes and George Duncan. It was the first of Hagen's four Open Championships and the fourth of his eleven major titles.
Hagen, the winner over Barnes in the PGA Championship finals in 1921, was the 36-hole leader at 149, two strokes ahead of Duncan, Barnes, and five-time champion J.H. Taylor. In the third round, defending champion Jock Hutchison shot 73 and moved to the lead, one shot ahead of Taylor and Jean Gassiat, and two shots over Hagen and Barnes. Despite a seven on the fourth hole, Hutchison carded a 36 on the front nine of the final round, but a 40 on the final nine led to a 76 and a fourth place finish. Hagen and Barnes battled for the championship, but Barnes' 73 was one off Hagen's 72, his lowest round of the championship. Duncan, the 1920 champion, shot an 81 in the third round and fell six strokes back into a tie for tenth, then rebounded with a 69 in the afternoon to climb the leaderboard and tie Barnes for second. Taylor and Gassiat shot high scores in the final round and dropped to sixth and seventh, respectively.
For the final time, two members of the Great Triumvirate finished in the top-10 at the Open Championship; Taylor, age 51, finished sixth and six-time champion Harry Vardon, age 52, tied for eighth.

The 1923 Open Championship was the 58th Open Championship, held 14–15 June at Troon Golf Club in Troon, South Ayrshire, Scotland. Arthur Havers holed a bunker shot on the 72nd hole to win his only major title, one stroke ahead of defending champion Walter Hagen, who won the following year.
Havers opened with three consecutive even-par rounds of 73 and carried a two-stroke lead over Hagen into the final round on Friday afternoon. Hagen threatened the lead throughout the round, and when Havers found a bunker on his approach shot at the 18th it appeared as if the door was open for Hagen. Havers, however, chipped in from the bunker to post a 76 and 295 (+3) total. Hagen found the same bunker and needed to hole out to force a 36-hole playoff on Saturday, but his shot narrowly missed and he finished a shot behind Havers. Macdonald Smith finished a stroke behind Hagen in third place.
The tournament at Troon was played in near-gale force conditions. An incident that occurred during the qualifying rounds best illustrates how windy conditions were. Aubrey Boomer hit a shot from a bunker, only to have the ball get blown back by the wind and land in his jacket pocket.
After his win here, Havers made a tour of the United States and defeated both Bobby Jones and Gene Sarazen in match play contests.
This was the first Open Championship played at Troon, which was granted its "Royal" accolade in 1978. It replaced nearby Prestwick as the primary Open venue in southwestern Scotland. Prestwick hosted its 24th and final Open in 1925.

Karol Wedel

Karol Ernest Wedel (1813 - 1902) was a candy maker of German ancestry member of the Wedel family, who settled in (then partitioned) Poland.
He was faithful of the Evangelical-Augsburg Church in Poland.
Wedel was a German candy maker who came to Warsaw in the beginning of 1845 and began to cooperate with Karol Grohnert who was an owner of a confectionery store at 12 Piwna Street. The cooperation between two men lead to success and to a large faithful group of consumers.
Soon after, around 1851, Karol Wedel became financially independent and opened his own store at 12 Miodowa Street, and next to it, a steam-powered factory making chocolates. His company, E.Wedel, would grow to become a leading confectionery company of Poland. One year later, he introduced his great hit "karmelki smietankowe" ("cream caramels"); the "karamelki smietankowe" success was aided by a successful commercial campaign in "Kurier Warszawski" newspaper.
"Totally new and distinct "confectioner’s" composition, and over all a substance that cures and alleviates all chest pains, extremely effective for the aliments of the spring months, and even for those not suffering and those who favour great delicate flavour -- very pleasant product."
Another product made popular by Wedel was hot chocolate. The store was selling over fifty cups a day of the hot chocolate. As the years passed, more products were introduced. By 1862, the "C.E. Wedel" company placed ads in Warsaw's newspapers for chocolates such as "Brilliant" and "Dessert". These were described as "Chocolat praline a'la crem aux nougat, aux pistaches, napolitan, de demes, de brilliant a'la vanille royal, a'la sultan" -- in different shapes and flavours, candy made of almonds, royal marcepan, caramels, and prepared fruit -- "prunelles glaces -- reingloud glaces et fruits cristallises."
Wedel married Karolina Wisnowska (1819-1893), daughter of another famous Warsaw candy and sweets maker. In 1864, Wedel's son, Emil Albert Fredryk Wedel (1841-1919) returned from an apprenticeship tour of confectioneries in Germany, Switzerland, England, and France, and received a Ph.D. in Chemistry (Food Chemistry). Immediately, he started helping in the running of the family business. In 1876, his father gave him the company as a wedding gift on the very day of his marriage to Karolina.

1924 Open Championship

The 1924 Open Championship was the 59th Open Championship, held 26–27 June at Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake, England. Walter Hagen won the second of his four Open Championships, one stroke ahead of runner-up Ernest Whitcombe. It was the fifth of Hagen's eleven major championships. Two years earlier in 1922, he became the Open's first winner born in the United States.
Cyril Tolley, the 1920 British Amateur champion, took the first round lead with a 73, but his 82 in the second round dropped him out of contention. Meanwhile, Whitcombe carded a 70 after a first round 77 to take a two-stroke lead over five-time champion John Henry Taylor. Hagen and Macdonald Smith were in third place, three behind. Hagen closed the deficit in the third round with a 74 to Whitcombe's 77, while George Duncan, Frank Ball, and Smith were three back. In the final round, Duncan finished at 308 while Ball and Smith both finished on 304, which left Hagen and Whitcombe to battle for the title. Whitcombe shot 43 on the front-nine but responded with a 35 on the back to post 302. Hagen also shot 43 on the front but played his trademark brand of golf on the back. He sliced his second shot on the 12th and found a bunker on the 13th, but both times recovered with a pitch and a putt. Hagen needed a 6-footer on the final hole to win and sank the downhill putt to post 301 for a one stroke victory. (Had the putt not dropped, a 36-hole playoff was in order for Saturday.)
Smith was three strokes back in a tie for third place, one of twelve times he finished in the top-5 of a major championship without a victory. Taylor finished in fifth at the age of 53, thirty years after his first Open title. Gene Sarazen, age 22, played in his first British Open this year and placed 41st. He won the championship in 1932 and played in the Open until 1976.

1925 Open Championship

The 1925 Open Championship was the 60th Open Championship, held 25–26 June at Prestwick Golf Club in Prestwick, South Ayrshire, Scotland. In the final Open at Prestwick, Jim Barnes captured his only Open title, one stroke ahead of runners-up Ted Ray and Archie Compston. It was Barnes' fourth and final major title; he won the first two PGA Championships in 1916 and 1919, and the U.S. Open in 1921.
Born and raised in Cornwall, England, Barnes opened with a course record 70 to take a four stroke lead as the course was dry and fast. In the second round, Macdonald Smith carded a new course record 69 for the lead at 145, two shots ahead of Barnes, who only managed a 77. Smith followed with a 76 in the third round on Friday morning and took a five-shot lead over Barnes and Compston into the final round. Barnes finished his round early and posted a 74 for a 300 total. Beginning his round after Barnes had already finished his, Smith knew that a round of 78 would win him the championship. But after starting with a 4-3 on the first two holes, he dropped three shots on the next three holes. Smith took a 6 at the 7th and 8th and went out in 42. He found a bunker on the 11th and took a 5, and shot another 6 on the 15th. Smith finished the round with an 82 and a 303 total, good enough only for fourth place. Ted Ray, the 1912 champion, finished tied for second with Compston at 301.
Smith's problems in the final round were possibly due to the huge gallery that followed him. Anticipating that he would easily win, 10,000 spectators crowded around Smith, more than the course layout or tournament stewards could handle. Ray's runner-up finish was his final top-ten in a major, as was John Henry Taylor's sixth place showing. Smith never won a major, but was runner-up on three occasions.
This was the last of the 24 Opens played at Prestwick, which hosted the first twelve. It was replaced by adjacent Troon Golf Club ("Royal Troon" since 1978) as the Open venue for southwestern Scotland. Turnberry was added to the rota in 1977, southwest of Prestwick.
It was the last Open scheduled for just two days, at 36 holes each. In 1926, the first two rounds were on Wednesday and Thursday, and following a 36-hole cut, the final two rounds were played on Friday. This format was continued through 1965.

1926 Open Championship

The 1926 Open Championship was the 61st Open Championship, held 23–25 June at the Royal Lytham & St Annes Golf Club in Lytham St Annes, England. Amateur Bobby Jones won the first of his three Claret Jugs, two strokes ahead of runner-up Al Watrous. Jones was the first amateur to win the title in 29 years, last by Harold Hilton in 1897. Americans finished in the top four spots and it was the fifth victory by an American in six years.
Walter Hagen opened with a 68 to take the lead, but a 77 in the second round dropped him back. In his second Open and already the winner of two U.S. Open titles, Jones played steady golf and carded rounds of 72-72-73, but trailed leader Watrous by two strokes after 54 holes. Jones was still two behind as he and Watrous reached the decisive 17th hole. Jones hit his drive into deep rough, but a superb approach allowed him to reach the green in two. Watrous also reached the green in two but three-putted. Jones played the tough final 5 holes in 4-3-4-4-4 to post a 74 and 291 total, while Watrous struggled to a 78 and 293. Hagen, playing behind Jones and Watrous, had a chance to tie by holing his second shot on the 18th, but his shot rolled past the hole and into a bunker and he settled for third place.
Jones, age 24, won his first Open Championship in just his second appearance. His first was five years earlier and was less than pleasant: he walked off the Old Course at St Andrews in 1921 in frustration after taking several shots to get out of a bunker. He went on to win two more Opens; his successful defense in 1927 was back at the Old Course, and his third in 1930 at Royal Liverpool was the second leg of his celebrated grand slam. Its first leg was the 1930 British Amateur, won two weeks earlier.
This Open Championship witnessed a number of firsts. For the first time, an admission fee was charged for spectators. Also, sectional qualifying was introduced for the first time to reduce the field. The championship was also expanded to three days for the first time. And Harry Vardon, aged 56, missed his first cut in the Open Championship; he had made the cut in every Open he played since 1893.

Aubrey Boomer and Fred Robson tied for second place, six shots back.
Future three-time champion Henry Cotton, age 20, made his Open debut and finished in ninth place. Five-time champion John Henry Taylor made his last cut in the Open at the age of 56.
In this era there were no exemptions, not even for the defending champion, and Jones had to qualify with the rest of the field. The 36-hole qualifier was held on Monday and Tuesday on the Old and New courses, and reduced the field for the tournament proper to the top hundred, plus ties. In heavy rain early that flooded the bunkers, Jones shot 76 on Monday at the Old Course and 71 on Tuesday at the New Course for 147, three strokes behind the low qualifier, Cyril Tolley, the 1920 (and 1929) British Amateur champion.

1928 Open Championship

The 1928 Open Championship was the 63rd Open Championship, held 9–11 May at Royal St George's Golf Club in Sandwich, England. Walter Hagen won the third of his four Open Championship titles, two strokes ahead of runner-up Gene Sarazen. Hagen again prevailed at Royal St George's, site of his first Open win in 1922. It was the tenth of his eleven major titles. His second Open victory came in 1924 at Royal Liverpool.
Two-time defending champion Bobby Jones decided not to make the trip across the Atlantic this year, meaning all eyes were on the other American stars, Hagen and Sarazen. Two weeks prior, Hagen played a match against Archie Compston and lost badly, 18 & 17. Realizing he needed practice, Hagen resolved to skip the parties for which he had become famous and concentrate on his game. His work paid off, as he carried an one-stroke lead over Sarazen into the final round, with Compston two back. A final round 72 left Hagen at 292 total, two better than Sarazen and three ahead of Compston.
Hagen, 35, successfully defended the Open title the following year for his fourth and final championship. Six-time champion Harry Vardon, age 58, made his last cut in the Open Championship and finished in 47th. He played the Open just once more, the following year.
For this year and again in 1929, the Open was played earlier than usual, in early May: Hagen won both.

Percy Alliss held the lead after the first round with a 69, while Leo Diegel matched that score in the second round to take the 36-hole lead. After a first-round 75, defending champion Hagen recorded an Open Championship record 67 in the second round on Thursday and was two back of Diegel. Scores on Friday over the final two rounds soared. Diegel shot 82 in the third round, with Alliss and Abe Mitchell at 76 and 78, respectively. Hagen, meanwhile, finished with two rounds of 75, giving him 292 total. Diegel was a shot behind runner-up Farrell in third place, while Alliss and Mitchell shared fourth at 300. Alliss and Mitchell were the only non-Americans to finish in the top-10.
Hagen, age 36, played the tournament just twice more, in 1933 and 1937. Six-time champion Harry Vardon, age 59, played the Open for the final time and missed the cut. Similar to 1928, this Open was played earlier than usual, in early May.

The 1930 Open Championship was the 65th Open Championship, held 18–20 June at Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake, England. Bobby Jones won his third Open Championship title, two strokes ahead of runners-up Leo Diegel and Macdonald Smith, on his way to the single-season Grand Slam. 
Jones arrived in Hoylake after winning the British Amateur championship a week before. He opened with a 70, leaving him in a tie for the lead with Henry Cotton and Smith. Jones followed with a 72 to take an one-stroke lead over Fred Robson after 36 holes. Archie Compston's third round score of 68 gave him an one-shot lead over Jones heading to the final round, but he then collapsed with an 82 and finished in sixth. Jones also struggled on the round, but a brilliant bunker shot on the 16th to within inches of the hole helped him card a 75 and a clubhouse lead of 291. Diegel was tied with Jones after the 13th, but he dropped shots at 14 and 16 and finished two behind. Smith came to the 17th needing to play the final two holes in no worse than six shots to tie Jones, but he missed his putt for a 3 and tied Diegel for second place.
Jones became the first player since John Ball in 1890 to win both the British Amateur and British Open in the same year. Returning to the United States with the first two jewels of the Grand Slam, he completed the feat by winning the U.S. Open in July and the U.S. Amateur in late September. Jones then retired from competitive golf at age 28 and never played in the Open Championship again; through 2012, he remains the last amateur to win it.
Arnaud Massy, the 1907 champion, played in his final Open at age 52 and missed the cut.

1931 Open Championship

The 1931 Open Championship was the 66th Open Championship, held 3–5 June at Carnoustie Golf Links in Carnoustie, Angus, Scotland. Scottish-born Tommy Armour outlasted José Jurado of Argentina by a single stroke to win his only Open title, and his third and final major championship.
Johnny Farrell, Henry Cotton, and William Twine each owned a share of the lead after the first round after shooting even-par 72. Cotton shared the lead with Jurado after the second round, with Armour a stroke behind. Cotton slipped back with a 79 in the third round, while Jurado shot 73 to open up a three shot lead over Macdonald Smith and Arthur Havers, with Farrell and Reg Whitcombe four back and Armour, Percy Alliss, and Gene Sarazen five back. Despite a shaky finish which saw him need 11 strokes on the last two holes, Alliss took the clubhouse lead of 298 after a 73. Armour surpassed that total after a course-record 71, finishing at 296 total. Still on the course when Armour finished, Jurado needed a 75 to win the title. After making the turn in 36, he found trouble on the back-nine. Jurado arrived at the 17th needing to finish with fives on the last two holes to tie Armour, but his drive found the burn and he carded a 6. Now needing a 4 on the last, he hit his approach to , but his putt to tie just missed, securing the championship for Armour.
Armour, age 36 and a U.S. citizen, played the Open Championship just once more. He returned to Britain to defend his title in 1932 and finished in 17th place.
Defending champion Bobby Jones retired from competition in 1930 and did not compete.

Sarazen opened the tournament with a 70 (–4) and took a one stroke lead over four players. He followed with a 69 for 139 (–9) and had a three-stroke lead over Percy Alliss after 36 holes. Sarazen increased his lead to four after a third round 70, this time over Arthur Havers, who shot a course-record 68 (–6). An even-par 74 in the final round saw Sarazen post a tournament record 283 total. Havers, playing well behind Sarazen, needed a 69 to win, but made the turn in 37 and could not close the gap. He could only manage a 76 for a total of 289. Smith finished with scores of 71-70 to finish in solo 2nd place at 288 (–8).
Two weeks later in New York, Sarazen won the U.S. Open and joined Bobby Jones (1926, 1930) as the only two to win both the British Open and U.S. Open in the same year. Subsequent winners of both were Ben Hogan (1953), Lee Trevino (1971), Tom Watson (1982), and Tiger Woods (2000).
This was the only Open Championship held at Prince's, just north of Royal St George's, which has since been the only venue in southeastern England to host.

Bridge Island Meadows

Bridge Island Meadows is an inaccessible nature reserve owned by The Trustees of Reservations on the floodplains of the upper Charles River in Millis, Massachusetts. The property was a 1974 gift from Dr. and Mrs. John D. Constable to the Trustees of Reservations.
Description.
This wooded upland rises to the east above the floodplains of the Charles River where the intermittent waters of Bogastow Brook enter South End Pond. Lower terrain around this point is wetland, making access to Bridge Island Meadows extremely difficult.
Because it is surrounded by wetlands and is accessible only by boat, Bridge Island Meadows is a "private favorite of intrepid paddlers." The town of Millis offers three canoe launch points into the Charles River near this greenspace. One can approach the property by paddling a kayak or other small, maneuverable boat up the Charles River and turning west near the Medfield State Hospital up a small stream that leads to South End Pond. The passage to South End Pond through Bogastow Brook is even more challenging as it is a small, intermittent tributary that is thick with vegetation.
Boat landing is made very difficult by the grasses and other plants that grow tall and thick but, according to the Trustees of Reservations, a "successful journey is rewarded by bushwhacking to a 130-foot tree-covered knoll at the south end of the Reservation offering glimpses of the surrounding floodplain." This isolated place is also of interest to birdwatchers.
The reservation is "open" all year, sunrise to sundown.
Upper Charles River Valley.
The Trustees of Reservations protection on Bridge Island Meadows in its untamed state is a part of a collaborative effort between municipalities, non-profit organizations, and individuals committed to the "protection of the natural beauty and environmental value of the Upper Charles River Valley" From its source in Hopkinton, Massachusetts until it flows into Boston Harbor, the eighty-five mile long waterway is "one of the most beautiful and accessible of America's urban rivers."

1933 Open Championship

The 1933 Open Championship was the 68th Open Championship, held 5–8 July at the Old Course at St Andrews in St Andrews, Scotland. Denny Shute defeated fellow American Craig Wood by five strokes in a 36-hole Saturday playoff to win his only Open title, the first of his three major championships.
A group of four players shared the 54-hole lead at 216 (–3): Henry Cotton, Abe Mitchell, Syd Easterbrook, and Leo Diegel. Wood began the final round a stroke behind, while Shute was three back at even par. The final round was a disaster for the leaders as Easterbrook shot 77 (+4), while Cotton and Mitchell both carded 79 (+6). Shute and Wood tied for the clubhouse lead with rounds of 73 and 75, respectively. Diegel found the 18th green in two and needed only a two-putt to join the playoff. He left his first putt short, then completely missed the ball on his second attempt. The untimely mistake caused him to miss out on the playoff by a single stroke, as did American Gene Sarazen.
During the playoff, Wood opened with a pair of sixes and was four strokes down after two holes. He managed to hit a drive at the 5th, but he found a bunker and lost a stroke on the hole. Shute prevailed over Wood in the 36-hole playoff by five shots. Wood lost playoffs at all four major championships before finally winning one, this loss was the first.
This was the first playoff at the Open in a dozen years, since 1921, also won by an American at St Andrews; Jock Hutchison (1884–1977) was born in Scotland but became a U.S. citizen the previous year.
The Old Course was par 73 in 1933; the #17 Road Hole was a par-5 through the 1946 Open.

Henry Cotton began the tournament with a round of 67, then shot a tournament-record 65 in the second round to open up a ten shot lead over the field. After a third round of 72 he still led by 10 going into the final round. Despite his comfortable lead, Cotton suffered from nerves and began to feel the pressure in the final round. He made the turn in 40, then dropped three shots on the next three holes. Suddenly it appeared as if his lead was in jeopardy. He managed to get up-and-down on the 13th, however, and steadied himself on his way to a 79 and a five shot win over Sid Brews. His 283 total tied the tournament record set by Gene Sarazen two years earlier.
Cotton was the first Englishman to win the Open Championship since Arthur Havers in 1923. The past 10 Opens had all been won by American-born players or Englishmen living in the United States. Cotton's win here was part of a long period of sustained excellence in the tournament. From 1930 through 1952, he finished in the top-10 of every Open he played except one. In all, he played in 20 Opens between 1927 and 1958, winning three and finishing in the top-10 in 17 of them.

Defending champion Henry Cotton took the first round lead after an opening 68, with Alf Perry a stroke behind. Charles Whitcombe carded his own round of 68 in the second round and took the lead by three over Cotton and Alf Padgham after 36 holes, with Perry falling five back. In the third round it was Perry who caught fire, shooting a 67 and moving ahead of Cotton and Whitcombe, who shot 76 and 73, respectively. A 72 in the final round was enough for Perry to prevail by four over Padgham. Whitcombe finished in third place, while Cotton fell to seventh with a final round 75. Amateur Lawson Little, the reigning British Amateur champion, finished in a tie for 4th. Perry's winning total of 283 equaled the tournament scoring record.
Perry's win was the first of any kind for him as a professional golfer, and he only won three more times. He finished in third place in the 1939 Open, but otherwise had no other top-10 finishes in a major championship. He was a member of three Ryder Cup teams.

After the second round, W. J. Cox and Adams were tied for the lead, with five players a shot back, including Padgham and Henry Cotton. Adams and Cotton shared the 54-hole lead, with Padgham and Tom Green a stroke behind. In the final round, Padgham tied Adams for the lead at the turn. He made a 4 on the 17th, then made a 15-footer for a 3 at the 18th to post a 287 total. Adams stood on the 17th knowing that he needed to play the last two holes in eight strokes to tie Padgham. His approach shot found a greenside bunker, and after he failed to get up-and-down he now needed a 3 on the 18th. He found the green in two, but his putt lipped out and he finished a stroke behind Padgham. Cotton and Green were still on the course, but neither could mount a charge, giving Padgham the championship.
Future four-time Open champion Bobby Locke finished tied for 8th in his major championship debut. Jim Ferrier, the winner of the 1947 PGA Championship, also made his debut in a major and finished in 44th.
The two-day qualifier on Monday and Tuesday was delayed by weather for a day, which pushed the schedule back. The first round was played on Thursday, second on Friday, and the final two rounds on Saturday.

The 1937 Open Championship was the 72nd Open Championship, held 7–9 July at Carnoustie Golf Links in Carnoustie, Scotland. Henry Cotton won the second of his three Open titles, prevailing by two strokes over a tough field that included many American stars.
The Ryder Cup was held just prior to the Open Championship and the members of the victorious American team decided to stay for the tournament, creating a star-studded field. An American, Ed Dudley, took the first round lead with a 70. Reg Whitcombe moved into the lead after the second round, with his brother Charles and Dudley two back. At this point, Henry Cotton was in 6th place, five shots back. The final two rounds were played in a steady, cold rain. Whitcombe maintained his lead with a third-round score of 74, two shots ahead of his brother, while Cotton moved up to three behind. The weather proved to be Whitcombe's downfall in the final round. On the 7th tee, his club slipped out of his hands as he was swinging and the ball traveled only 40 yards. He ended up taking a six and finished with a 76 and 292 total. Cotton did not seem affected by the conditions and arrived at the 18th needing only a six to win. His approach shot found a greenside bunker, but he was able to get down in five to post a 290 total. Only Charles Whitcombe could catch Cotton, but he could manage no better than a 76 and finished four strokes behind.
The American contingent that played the tournament included Byron Nelson and Sam Snead, both of whom were making their Open Championship debuts. Nelson played the Open just once more, not returning until 1955. Snead played four more Opens, but he won the championship in 1946. The American Ryder Cup captain, four-time Open champion Walter Hagen, finished in 26th place in his final Open appearance at age 44.

1938 Open Championship

The 1938 Open Championship was the 73rd Open Championship, held 6–8 July at Royal St George's Golf Club in Sandwich, England. In terrible weather conditions that caused scores to soar, Reg Whitcombe prevailed by two strokes over runner-up Jimmy Adams to win his only major title. The purse was £500 with a winner's share of £100.
Dick Burton, John J. Busson, and Bill Cox shared the 36-hole lead at even par 140, with Whitcombe two strokes back after consecutive rounds of 71. In the last two rounds, however, the weather turned from challenging to treacherous. Gale force winds ripped apart the large exhibition tent and scattered debris for a mile around. Alf Padgham drove the green on the 11th hole, while Cyril Tolley cleared the water on the 14th only to have the wind blow his ball back into the hazard. Only seven sub-80 scores were recorded in the final round. The leaders suffered terribly in the conditions: Burton finished 78-85, Busson shot 83-80, while Cox went 84-80. Whitcombe's scores of 75-78 were enough to post a 295 total, two ahead of Adams and three clear of defending champion Henry Cotton.

Occoneechee Council

The Occoneechee Council (421) of the Boy Scouts of America serves some 20,000 youths and 7,000 adults in central North Carolina, USA. The Occoneechee Council is the largest Boy Scout council in North Carolina and serves Chatham, Cumberland, Durham, Franklin, Granville, Harnett, Lee, Moore, Orange, Vance, Wake and Warren counties. These twelve counties are divided into thirteen districts.
Organization.
The Council headquarters is located in Raleigh, North Carolina, in the Highwoods Office Complex. Occoneechee Council operates three year-round camping properties, available for use by the units and districts of the Council and non-Scouting groups. The Occoneechee Scout Reservation, which includes Camp Durant and Camp Reeves, is a wilderness property in Moore County. Camp Campbell, a primitive camping facility, is located on Kerr Lake in Virginia.
The Council derives its name from the Occaneechi Indian tribe, a band of the Saponi Nation, which lived throughout the North Carolina Piedmont and still maintains a community in Hillsbourough, a town served by the Occoneechee Council.
The twelve counties that comprise the Occoneechee Council are divided into twelve districts. Each district is led by a volunteer District Chairman, a volunteer District Commissioner and a professional District Executive, employed by the Occoneechee Council. The districts of the Occoneechee Council are organized as follows:
Finance.
The Occoneechee Council is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. The Executive Committee of the Executive Board serves as trustees and officers of the corporation. The annual budget of the Occoneechee Council is $3.5 million. Of this, $1.25 million is raised through the annual Friends of Scouting giving campaign. The Council also participates in the annual popcorn product sale, which generates $1.5 million to support Scouting programs in the Council.
The Occoneechee Council is in the final stages of the $8.6 million “Come With Us and Build Leaders” Capital Campaign to improve the physical plant of Camp Durant and Camp Campbell. The highlight of the campaign is the fully air-conditioned Grand Lodge Dining Hall at Camp Durant, which opened in 2009. The Capital Campaign also included a complete renovation of each program area at Camp Durant, and the construction of the Charlie Sullivan Lodge Building, to serve as the headquarters of Order of the Arrow Occoneechee Lodge, #104. The Come With Us and Build Leaders Capital Campaign is chaired by O. Temple Sloan, Jr., the Chairman of General Parts, Inc., which owns CarQuest Auto Parts.
Camps.
Camp Durant.
Camp Durant is the primary summer camping facility of the Occoneechee Council. Camp Durant is a part of the Occoneechee Scout Reservation, a tract in northwestern Moore County, North Carolina. The property straddles the geographic division of the Piedmont and Sandhills regions of North Carolina.
Camp Durant operates as a full-service summer camp for the Scouts of the Occoneechee Council during the months of June, July and August. The Council currently offers five weeks of summer camp but will expand as the attendance increases.
As a result of the “Come with Us and Build Men” Capital Campaign, the Occoneechee Council has completed a complete renovation of the camp. The hallmark of the campaign is the completion of the 700-seat Grand Lodge Dining Hall. This fully air conditioned dining hall will seat the entire camp population at one setting, and boasts four serving lines and a full-service Trading Post and Grill below. Other facilities improvements include:
Camp Durant has fourteen campsites, each divided into two sides. Each campsite also has a shower house, complete with three hot/cold showers and three flushing toilets. These shower houses also allow for electric power during summer camp. The entire camp has also been wired with fiber optic cables, which allows for both wired and wireless highspeed internet connections.
Camp Reeves.
Situated on the remainder of the Occoneechee Scout Reservation, Camp Reeves provides primitive facilities for unit and district camping. The camp has several large Jamboree-style camping fields, as well as unit campsites and several buildings. Camp Reeves was the original summer camp for the Occoneechee Council after the Moore County property was purchased.
Camp Campbell.
Camp Campbell is the most primitive of the camping properties operated by the Occoneechee Council. Located on Kerr Lake, in Townsville, Virginia, just north of Henderson, North Carolina, Camp Campbell offers Scouting units access to Kerr Lake.
Occoneechee Lodge.
The Occoneechee Council is the home council of Occoneechee Lodge #104, the local branch of the Order of the Arrow, Scouting’s National Honor Society. Occoneechee Lodge 104 is regarded as the best Lodge in the country by many of it's members and is also one of the biggest in the country. The Occoneechee Lodge has more than 2,000 members and meets several times a year at Camp Durant for fellowship and service. They recently hosted the largest Conclave the Order of the Arrow has ever seen.

1939 Open Championship

The 1939 Open Championship was It was the 74th Open Championship, held 5–7 July at the Old Course at St Andrews in St Andrews, Scotland. Dick Burton of England won his only major title, two strokes ahead of runner-up Johnny Bulla. The purse was £500 and the winner's share was £100. It was the last Open played for seven years.
Despite taking an 8 at the 14th hole, Bobby Locke of South Africa opened the tournament on Wednesday with a round of 70 (−3), tying Burton for the lead. In the second round, Locke again found trouble on 14, and after a ball out of bounds he was out of contention. John Fallon of Scotland was the surprise leader after 54 holes by two shots, but he could not cope with the strong winds and fell back to 3rd place with a final round 79 (+6).
Bulla, the only American to make the 36-hole cut, began the final round on Friday afternoon four strokes behind Fallon. At the 2nd hole he hooked his drive over the parallel 17th fairway and into a railway yard; he finished with a round of even-par 73 and established a clubhouse lead of 292, even par. Burton, setting out just as Bulla was finishing, needed a 72 to win the title and came to the 18th needing a par four. He hit a drive over , pitched to , and then holed the putt for a birdie 3 and a two-shot win.
The previous three Opens at St Andrews had been won by Americans; Burton was the first Briton to win the Open at the Old Course since 1910, won by James Braid of Scotland. Since Burton's 1939 win, the sole British winner at St Andrews was Nick Faldo of England in 1990.
This was the last Open played for seven years, until 1946. World War II started in September 1939 and caused the cancellation of the tournament from 1940 through 1945. Burton himself enlisted in the Royal Air Force shortly after his win.

Mariner-class gunvessel

The "Mariner" class was a class of 8-gun gunvessels (sloops from 1884) built for the Royal Navy between 1883 and 1888. "Melita" was built in the Malta Dockyard, the only substantial ship of the Royal Navy ever to be built in the island.
Construction.
Design.
Designed by Nathaniel Barnaby, the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction, the hull was of composite construction; that is, iron keel, frames, stem and stern posts with wooden planking. The entire class were re-classified in November 1884 as sloops before they entered service.
Propulsion.
Propulsion was provided by a 2-cylinder horizontal compound-expansion steam engine of driving a single screw. This arrangement provided enough power to drive the ships at , although "Icarus" and "Melita" recorded 12.5 knots.
Sail plan.
All the ships of the class were built as barque-rigged vessels, except "Icarus", which had no main yards provided, making her a barquentine.
Armament.
The class was designed and built to carry eight 5-inch 38cwt breech-loading guns, one light gun and eight machine guns. "Melita" had 40cwt guns instead of 38cwt, and "Reindeer" had two of her guns removed.
Construction.
All the ships were laid down in 1882-83. While most of the ships were completed relatively quickly, "Melita" took six years to build. The intention behind building her at Malta was to make use of the substantial workforce at Malta Dockyard who were otherwise (it was felt) unemployed when the Mediterranean Fleet was away. The experiment cost £10,000 more than the British-built versions, and incurred substantial delay; it was not repeated, and "Melita" remained the only warship of any significant size ever built in Malta for the Royal Navy.

The White Tiger

The White Tiger is the debut novel by Indian author Aravind Adiga. It was first published in 2008 and won the 40th Man Booker Prize in the same year. The novel provides a darkly humorous perspective of India’s class struggle in a globalized world as told through a retrospective narration from Balram Halwai, a village boy. In detailing Balram’s journey first to Delhi, where he works as a chauffeur to a rich landlord, and then to Bangalore, the place to which he flees after killing his master and stealing his money, the novel examines issues of religion, caste, loyalty, corruption and poverty in India. Ultimately, Balram transcends his sweet-maker caste and becomes a successful entrepreneur, establishing his own taxi service. In a nation proudly shedding a history of poverty and underdevelopment, he represents, as he himself says, "tomorrow."
The novel has been well-received, making the "New York Times" bestseller list in addition to winning the Man Booker Prize and holds the rating of 4.5 stars out of 5. Aravind Adiga, 33 at the time, was the second youngest writer as well as the fourth debut writer to win the prize in 2008. Adiga says his novel "attempt
to catch the voice of the men you meet as you travel through India — the voice of the colossal underclass." According to Adiga, the exigence for "The White Tiger" was to capture the unspoken voice of people from "the Darkness" – the impoverished areas of rural India, and he "wanted to do so without sentimentality or portraying them as
mirthless humorless weaklings as they are usually."
Plot summary.
"The White Tiger" takes place in India. The protagonist Balram Halwai is born in Laxmangarh, a rural village in "the Darkness". Balram narrates his life in a letter, which he wrote in seven consecutive nights and addressed to the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao. In his letter, Balram explains how he, the son of a rickshaw puller, escaped a life of servitude to become a successful businessman, describing himself as a successful entrepreneur. Balram begins the novel by describing his life in Laxmangarh. There he lived with his grandmother, parents and brother and extended family. He is a smart child; however, he is forced to quit school in order to help pay for his cousin sister's dowry. He begins to work in a teashop with his brother in Dhanbad. While working in the teashop he begins to learn about India's government and economy from the customers' conversations. Balram describes himself as a bad servant and decides that he wants to become a driver.
Balram learns how to drive and gets a job driving Ashok, the son of the Stork, one of Laxmangarh's landlords. During a trip back to his village, Balram disrespects his grandmother and tells the reader and the Chinese Premier that in the next few months he intends to kill his boss. Balram moves to New Delhi with Ashok and his wife Ms Pinky. Throughout their time in New Delhi, Balram is exposed to the extensive corruption of India's society, including the government. In New Delhi the separation between poor and wealthy becomes even more evident by the juxtaposition of the wealthy with poor city dwellers.
One night Pinky decides to drive the car by herself and hits something. She is worried that it was a child in the hit and run. Ashok becomes increasingly involved with the corrupt government itself. Balram then decides that the only way that he will be able to escape India's "Rooster Coop" will be by killing and robbing Ashok. One raining day he murders Ashok by bludgeoning him with a bottle. He then manages to move to Bangalore. There he bribes the police in order to help start his own business. When one of his drivers kills a bike messenger Balram pays off the family. Balram explains that his family was almost certainly killed by the Stork as retribution for Ashok's murder. At the end of the novel Balram rationalizes his actions by saying that his freedom is worth the lives of his family and Ashok.
Topics.
Globalization.
"The White Tiger" takes place in a time in which increased technology has led to world globalization, and India is no exception. In the past decade, India has had one of the fastest booming economies. Specifically Americanization in India has played its role in the plot, since it provides an outlet for Balram to alter his caste. To satisfy Pinky’s want for American culture, Ashok, Pinky, and Balram simply move to Gurgaon instead of back to America. Globalization has assisted in the creation of an American atmosphere in India. Ashok justifies this move by explaining "Today it’s the "modernest" suburb of Delhi. American Express, Microsoft, all the big American companies have offices there. The main road is full of shopping malls—each mall has a cinema inside! So if Pinky Madam missed America, this was the best place to bring her". By blackmailing Ram Persad, the other driver, Balram is promoted and drives Ashok and Pinky to their new home.
Ashok is even convinced India is surpassing the USA, "There are so many more things I could do here than in New York now...The way things are changing in India now, this place is going to be like America in ten years". Balram is noticing the rapid growth as well. From the beginning of his story he knows that in order to rise above his caste he should become an entrepreneur. Although his taxi service is not an international business, Balram plans to keep up with the pace of globalization and change his trade when need be. "I‘m always a man who sees ‘tomorrow’ when others see ‘today.’" Balram's recognition of the increasing competition resulting from globalization contributes to his corruption.
Individualism.
Throughout the book, there are references to how Balram is very different from those back in his home environment. He is referred to as the "white tiger" (which also happens to be the title of the book). A white tiger symbolizes power in East Asian cultures, such as in Vietnam. It is also a symbol for freedom and individuality. Balram is seen as different from those he grew up with. He is the one who got out of the "Darkness" and found his way into the "Light".
Freedom.
In an interview with Aravind Adiga, he talked about how "The White Tiger" was a book about a man’s quest for freedom. Balram, the protagonist in the novel, worked his way out of his low social caste (often referred to as "the Darkness") and overcame the social obstacles that limited his family in the past. Climbing up the social ladder, Balram sheds the weights and limits of his past and overcomes the social obstacles that keep him from living life to the fullest that he can. In the book, Balram talks about how he was in a rooster coop and how he broke free from his coop. The novel is somewhat of a memoir of his journey to finding his freedom in India’s modern day capitalist society. Towards the beginning of the novel, Balram cites a poem from the Muslim poet Iqbal where he talks about slaves and says "They remain slaves because they can’t see what is beautiful in this world." Balram sees himself embodying the poem and being the one who sees the world and takes it as he rises through the ranks of society, and in doing so finding his freedom.
Immoral corruption.
Balram was born to the low caste in India, meaning that he grew up in very poor living conditions. As a child, Balram was seen as being smart. However, growing up, he was exposed into a lot of corruption and immoral behavior, e.g., the shopkeeper selling his employees' votes to the Great Socialist during election time. His childhood molded the person he was going to become in the future. Balram ends up doing anything to get himself into a higher caste and into the "Light". Balram becomes very selfish, evident by his many of his actions being equivocal in nature. This can be seen as both an immoral and moral way to improve oneself, especially if the country as a whole cheats, lies, and is full of deceit. His actions might be justified from the standpoint that anything since he was part of the losing crowd he might as well join the crowd that is winning, also known as "if you can't beat them join them." Finding ways to ensure the competition does not succeed, finding ways to get ahead of everyone else, and coming out on top are all a big part of the world and if you are constantly losing then you might as well play dirty to win. It can be seen as being moral because of the competitive nature of our globalized capitalist economic system. In a capitalist economy, any way one can get ahead is fair game. However, if one is looking at this from a non-personal standpoint, the actions Balram does are very immoral. He cheats people to put himself in a position to gain for himself. Balram does everything in his power for personal gain, even killing his boss.
Social class/caste.
The book shows a modern day, capitalist Indian society with free market and free business. It also shows how it can create economic division. In India there are not social classes, there are social castes. The novel portrays India’s society as very negative towards the lower social caste. Balram refers to it as the "Darkness". When Balram was asked which caste he was from, he knew that it could ultimately cause a biased stance in his employer and determine the future of his employment. There is definitely a big difference seen in Balram’s lower caste from back home and his current higher caste in their lifestyles, habits, and standards of living. This novel is showing how our economic system today creates socioeconomic gaps that create a big division in society. It limits opportunity, social mobility, health, and other rights and pleasures that should be given to all. There is a big difference in the amount of money spread around in society today and this book is alluding to that fact.
The rooster coop.
The author frequently mentions the rooster coop when describing the situation or characteristics of the servant class in India and he also defends himself for murdering his master with it. The author first describes how the rooster coop looks like in the market in Old Delhi, in order to give the visualization to the target audience:
"Hundreds of pale hens and brightly coloured roosters stuffed tightly into wire-mesh cages, packed as tightly as worms in a belly, pecking each other and shitting on each other, jostling just for breathing space; the whole cage giving off a horrible stench…The roosters in the coop smell the blood from above. They see the organs of their brothers lying .es those chickens living in a miserable condition with the poor class in India. "The very same thing is done with human beings in this country" From his analysis of the structure of the inequality in the country, the author comes to believe that liability for the suffering of the servant also lies with the mentality of the servant class, which he refers as "perpetual servitude". This ideology is so strong that "you can put the key of his emancipation in a man’s hands and he will throw it back at you with a curse".
According to his philosophy, individual action is the key to break out of the rooster coop and the servants are self-trapping. He validates his evil actions to his master by saying, "I think the Rooster Coop needs people like me to break out of it. It needs masters like Mr. Ashok – who, for all his numerous virtues, was not much of a master – to be weeded out, and exceptional servants like me to replace them.’’
The caste system.
A key component in "The White Tiger" is the discussion of the India caste system. The caste system in India is a social system that divides the Indian population into higher and lower social classes. Although said to be disappearing in urban India, the caste system still remains in rural India. A person is born into a caste, and the caste one belongs in determines his or her occupation. Balram gives his own breakdown of the caste system in India, describing that it was a "...clean, well-kept orderly zoo". But no longer - because that caste system broke down, and the powerful with the big bellies took over anything they could - and now there are only 2 castes in India - the haves and the have nots. Balram was born into the Halwai caste, meaning "sweet-maker", and was the son of a rickshaw puller - not a sweet-maker, because someone with power stole his destiny of being a sweet-maker from him.
Adiga brings awareness to the corrupt India caste system by having Balram work the country’s system to get what he wants and to become an entrepreneur by any means necessary, including murdering his boss. Balram educates the Chinese Premier throughout his letters about the corruption and immoral ways of India’s caste system and its economic gap. Although it may seem that Balram’s position in society will forever remain the same, he manages to go from a sweet shop worker, to a personal driver for a rich man, and finally to an owner of a small business.
Balram’s quest to becoming an entrepreneur shows the oppression of the lower caste system and the superiority of the upper caste. He tells the story of how India still has a caste system and political and economic corruption is still present. Balram shows the country of India in which a person high on the caste system can bribe people such as police officers with money to cover up murders, sabotage political opponents by rigging votes and money, and have privileges such as shopping in a mall specifically for those of high social and economic importance. He also shows the side of India in which those who are born into poverty and low castes may forever remain there and so will their children. Balram is a rare exception, as he experiences both sides of the caste system and manages to move up the social ladder.

Synchronica

Synchronica plc was a public listed (, ) software vendor which developed and marketed mobile messaging solutions for mobile network operators and mobile phone manufacturers. Its flagship product provided push email, instant messaging and social networking to a wide range of mobile phones, and was branded as Unity.
Synchronica was one of the industry's principal users of open industry standards, and their products supported the relevant standards developed by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA). In 2004, Synchronica became the first company to deploy a live installation of a SyncML device management (now OMA DM) server in a carrier-grade environment, with Siemens Mobile AG.
On 16 April 2012, Synchronica was acquired by Switzerland’s Myriad Group, in an all-share deal which valued the company at £23.9 million (around US$38 million). Myriad delisted Synchronica from the London Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange during Mid-May 2012.
History.
Synchronica Software GmbH was founded in 2004, specializing in open industry standards-based synchronization and device management solutions for the mobile industry. 
In March 2005, Synchronica was acquired by AIM listed infrastructure consultancy DAT Group, headquartered in the village of Bodiam in East Sussex. Later that year, the newly created group company underwent a management restructuring and rebranding to Synchronica plc. 
In April 2006, Synchronica moved headquarters from Bodiam to the historic town of Royal Tunbridge Wells in Kent.
In September 2011, the founder and CEO of the company, Carsten Brinkschulte, resigned from his position citing disagreements with the other board members regarding future strategy. 
At the time of the acquisition of Synchronica by Myriad, it emerged that the CFO, Angus Dent had acquired 800,000 shares in the company after the initial approach by Myriad - generating a profit of £48,000 following the sale. This transaction was investigated by the FSA under the insider trading regulations.
Acquisitions.
Synchronica engaged in several strategic acquisitions in an effort to bolster its competitive position in the fiercely contested mobile messaging market.
In November 2007, Synchronica acquired the assets and intellectual property of the US-based mobile email specialist GoodServer whose email enablement and integration technology was already a key part of Synchronica’s Mobile Gateway product.
Another key deal, which was completed in September 2008, was the acquisition of AxisMobile Limited. AxisMobile Limited was the operating subsidiary of Synchronica’s competitor, AxisMobile plc. AxisMobile developed a number of email technologies suitable for the consumer mass-market, and this intellectual property is now fully owned by Synchronica, who have integrated it into their Mobile Gateway product.
In March 2010, Synchronica acquired the OMA Instant Messaging and Presence Service business, reseller agreements, and existing worldwide mobile operator customer base, of the Instant Messaging developer Colibria AS. Synchronica integrated Colibria's IM technology into Mobile Gateway. In September of the same year, Synchronica acquired its Canadian mobile email rival, iseemedia Inc. As part of the deal, Synchronica acquired iseemedia's patent-pending document streaming technology, as well as contracts with three large mobile operators in India and South-East Asia. 
In February 2011, Synchronica acquired the assets of instant messaging vendor Neustar NGM including product, intellectual property and eleven customer contracts with international mobile operators and two tier-1 device manufacturers. In August 2011, Synchronica completed its final acquisition by taking the operator-branded messaging (OBM) assets from the Nokia Corporation which provided email and instant messaging (IM) services to tier one mobile operators in North America.

Chew Green

Chew Green is the site of the ancient Roman encampment Ad Fines in Northumberland, England, north of Rochester and west of Alwinton. The encampment was adjacent to Dere Street, a Roman road that stretched south to York (Eboracum), and almost on the present-day border with Scotland.
Archaeological excavation at Chew Green has uncovered a complex of Roman military camps consisting of a Roman fort, two fortlets, two camps and a section of Roman road. The Roman remains were overlaid with evidence of a medieval settlement that included a small chapel. The largest camp structure is a square that encloses about with a defensive rampart and ditch. Evidence inside the fort indicates it was used as permanent settlement. Ad Fines likely served only as a military base, not a colonial settlement.
The site is within the Northumberland National Park and within the Military Training Area at Otterburn.

Marquette Branch Prison

The Marquette Branch Prison (MBP) is located in Marquette, Michigan on the south shore of Lake Superior. The prison, which opened in 1889, is a state facility that holds about 1,100 inmates in maximum and minimum-security housing. The inmate population consists of adult males, aged twenty-one and older. The prison was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as State House of Correction and Branch Prison on November 23, 1977. MBP was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in order to maintain its original buildings. MBP has become one of the state's most outstanding tourist attractions because of the beautiful flower gardens and other landscaping around the prison grounds. MBP was a prison full of attempted escapes, bloodshed, and reconstruction during the 19th century. 
The first outdoor game to feature an official NHL team was held on February 2, 1954. The Detroit Red Wings played an exhibition game on an outdoor ice surface, in degree weather, against inmates at Marquette Branch Prison. After the first period the Red Wings led in the game 18–0; the rest of the game the score was not kept.
Origin.
During the late 19th century the population in the Upper Peninsula quickly grew as did the number of criminal convictions. Lower Michigan prisons (Ionia and Jackson) were becoming overpopulated and the cost of moving prisoners from the Upper Peninsula to the Lower Peninsula prisons was becoming expensive. Talk of building a prison in the Upper Peninsula began. The Business Men’s Association of Marquette, Michigan argued that Marquette provided a “centrally located community with excellent transportation and water facilities as well as the natural resources required to build the prison.” The Michigan legislature appropriated $150,000 to fund the proposed prison. The prison board of commissioners approved the site for the Marquette Branch Prison. A total of ten companies submitted bids for the prison. The lowest bid ($135,817.00) belonged to Wahlman and Grip of Ishpeming and they were given the contract. The first buildings included an administration building, east and west cell block wings connected by a rotunda, a dining hall, a hospital, and a power house. Construction began with the rotunda and west wing in July 1886 and all buildings were completed by June 22, 1889.
1800s.
Governor Cyrus G. Luce appointed Orison C. Tompkins as the first warden. The selection angered many people in the Upper Peninsula because Tompkins was from the Lower Peninsula. Tompkins’ first action was to get inmate tradesman from the prison in Jackson, Michigan so they could start construction of additional buildings. The first three prisoners, William Durno, Horace Becker, and Gust Peterson, were transferred from the prison at Jackson on June 22, 1889.
Early prisoners provided an array of nationalities. Convict #4, Alphonse Hetu, was a French-Canadian; convict #5, Paddy Brennan, was from Ireland; and convict #6, Mattis Walli, was born in Finland and sentenced from New York. Women were also sentenced to MBP at this time and their work was in the kitchen, laundry room, hospital, and hosiery mill. In 1893, women were no longer sentenced to MBP but to the Detroit House of Correction.
1900s.
Warden Catlin's murder.
In 1921 the sixth warden of MBP, Theodore Burr Catlin, was appointed. Soon after his appointment a grand jury began investigating the prison. The chief clerk was found guilty of embezzling prison funds. Then, September brought the escapes of three prisoners. First was Arthur “Gypsy Bob” Harper who escaped by hopping the fence. This was the first escape in seventeen years. Ten days later, two other convicts escaped over the same fence by using a ladder they had made from scrap lumber found in the prison yard that was being used during construction of additional cell blocks. All three convicts were caught and returned to MBP.
This was not the end of “Gypsy Bob’s” trouble-making. On December 11, 1921, along with two other convicts (Jasper Perry and Charles Roberts), Gypsy Bob attacked Warden Catlin, Deputy Fred Menhennett, the deputy’s son Arthur, and prison guard Charles Anderson in the prison movie theatre. The three convicts were armed with knives. They stabbed their four unsuspecting victims numerous times. The movie theatre was in total chaos, yet surprisingly, no other inmates got involved in the attacks. The main target of the three attackers was Warden Catlin who managed to close himself in a room until other prison guards were able to restore order and detain the three attackers. All four victims eventually died from complications caused by their knife wounds.
The attackers were flogged on three different occasions. On Monday December 12, 1921 Harper and Perry received 30 lashes each and Roberts received 25 lashes. Then Perry and Roberts each received 25 more lashes each on Tuesday and Wednesday. Harper was not flogged because he was acting insane (smashing his head on the floor) and eventually put in a straitjacket to avoid other personal harm. The punishment of flogging was approved by the governor in certain cases such as this. The murder case was eventually dismissed because the flogging had served as their punishment. They could not be legally punished again because that would be considered “double jeopardy” so the state of Michigan no longer had a case against Harper, Perry, and Roberts. The three remained at MBP to serve out their life sentences with no further punishment. After the death of Warden Catlin, a prisoner was quoted as saying, “Warden Catlin was a man of intense courage. He was fair and just to everyone and compromised on nothing. Punishment was meted out when deserved, and encouragement when appropriate. He was everything a prison warden should be.”
Escape attempts.
In March 1922, five inmates attempted to escape through the roof of the west wing. They were successful, but were recaptured by prison officials soon after their escape. In May, “Slippery Jim” Cushway and two other inmates escaped while at work. The three escaped in a car that Leo Carney stole from a place near where he worked and picked up the other two on the way to Milwaukee. Cushway had escaped numerous times from prison. Many other escapes were successful in the 1920s. In April 1923, two fugitives, Steve Madaja and Russell Smith, escaped through the roof of the west wing and were never retrieved. On June 21, two inmates working at the prison lumber yard were found missing. George Bloochas and George Natchoff had escaped; Natchoff had stolen a .45 caliber automatic and about 40 rounds of ammunition. The hunt began for these two fugitives. Bloochas was captured first and he warned the police of the danger of Natchoff because of the weapon he possessed. During days of swamp battle, Natchoff shot many rounds, killing one deputy, Frank Curran, and injuring another. Eventually they killed Natchoff, who had a total of 14 bullet holes in his body. These escapes represent a few of many escapes that occurred during the 1920s at MBP. Also in the 1920s additional cell blocks were constructed as well as new boilers and a new dining hall that could seat around 500 inmates.
Dr. Hornbogen's murder.
On August 27, 1931, three convicts (Andrew Germano, Charles Rosbury, Martin Duver) from Detroit opened fire in the hospital. The three first shot Doctor A.W. Hornbogen and then proceeded to the second level of an old factory and barricaded themselves. Exchange of fire continued for two hours. At one point a white flag was waived and a bottle with a note attached was thrown at the warden. The note read, “We have a bottle of explosives that will wreck this place, unless you give us a car and open the gates.” The warden responded with “Start shooting again, boys!” Tear bombs were eventually used and the three mobsters killed themselves as they realized that their capture was inevitable.
The mobsters’ motive seemed to be revenge on Dr. Hornbogen for the death of their friend, Fred Begeman, who had died of heart disease and kidney trouble under Dr. Hornbogen’s watch. The three intended to escape but their plan failed and the fatality list consisted of Dr. Hornbogen, Frank Oligschlager (trusty shot trying to help the doctor), Andrew Germano (convict), Charles Rosbury (convict), Martin Duver (convict), Frank Hohfer (convict who was armed but never engaged in the shoot-out and killed himself after his other three confederates killed themselves). This attempted escape caught national headlines, including "The New York Times".
2000s.
There are six level-V housing units surrounded by a twenty feet of stone wall and 10 feet of metal fencing. These units consist of single-prisoner cells and have a capacity of 546. The perimeter of the maximum security section is monitored by eight gun towers. Five of the eight gun towers have the capability to monitor activity inside the housing units.
There are four housing units for level-I inmates. This section consists of four dormitories, O Dorm, A Dorm, N Dorm, and P Dorm. “Both A and N Dorms have full-size gymnasiums and classrooms in them while O and P Dorms have large recreational dayrooms. All level-I housing units are double bunked. The capacity of the level-I housing units is 670.”
The Brooks Medical Center is an inpatient health care facility and outpatient clinic. There are more than 30 staff at the medical center, one doctor, two dentists, a dozen nurses, and several other support staff. There are two full service kitchens at MBP, a dairy farm, and a heating and power plant.
Programming at MBP currently consists of prisoner work assignments, psychological services, library services (MBP has one main law library and four other mini law libraries), a large volunteer program, religious, as well as recreation and educational programs. The programs provide inmates with opportunities to learn job skills, good habits, and good attitudes. The staff as MBP consists of 282 custody personnel and 145 other personnel.

Kom Peak

Kom Peak (, "vrah Kom") or Golyam Kom (Голям Ком, "Big Kom") is a peak in the western Balkan Mountains, located in western Bulgaria, not far from the Serbian border. The peak is 2,016 metres high and lies south of the town of Berkovitsa, of which it is a traditional symbol. Kom, along with the lower peaks Sreden Kom ("Middle Kom") and Malak Kom ("Little Kom") to the east, form a west-east elevation with a round grassy ridge, a steep rocky northern slope and a slant grassy southern slope. Looking north, one can see Berkovitsa and the surrounding fields, as well as Montana and the Ogosta Reservoir some 30 kilometres away.
The peak inspired national writer Ivan Vazov to create the poem "On Kom". In his honour, a bas-relief plaque bearing his image and excerpts from the poem has been installed on the peak. Kom also marks the start of the Bulgarian section of the European walking route E3, also known as the Kom-Emine path along the main ridge of the Balkan Mountains, as well as the eponymous off-road race.
There are several climbing routes to the summit, such as from the Kom chalet (two-hour climb), from the Petrohan Pass (taking 3 hours 30 minutes to reach the peak), from the villages of Komshtitsa and Gintsi (3 hours away).
The Nishava River, a major tributary of the South Morava, originates east of Kom Peak, as does the Visochitsa. Along with Midzhur, Kom is among the highest and best known peaks of the western Balkan Mountains. A Bulgarian brand of mineral water is branded after Kom. The peak is part of the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria, together with the museum of ethnography in Berkovitsa. There are several ski pistes descending from the peak.

Electoral district of Mount Hawthorn

The Electoral district of Mount Hawthorn was a Legislative Assembly electorate in the state of Western Australia. The district was named for the inner northern Perth suburb of Mount Hawthorn, which fell within its borders.
Mount Hawthorn was a new seat created under the "Redistribution of Seats Act 1929", which took effect at the 1930 election. The Labor member for Leederville and Collier Government minister, Harry Millington ran for and won the seat, holding it until his retirement from politics at the 1947 election, in which Labor lost government after 14 years in office. Les Nimmo of the Liberal Party narrowly won the seat, but with a redistribution prior to the 1950 election reducing the likelihood of a repeat, Nimmo opted to contest the new seat of Wembley Beaches. The redistribution had also merged the North-West Labor-held seats of Pilbara and Roebourne, so Pilbara MLA Bill Hegney contested and won Mount Hawthorn, which he held until his retirement in 1968. Ron Bertram then held the seat until its abolishment at the 1983 election. The redistribution which effected the end of the seat split its voters between the seat of Subiaco, Balcatta (which Bertram contested and won) and Perth.

De Walcott family

The de Walcott family were Lords of the Manor of Walcott from the late 12th century until the late 14th century.
"This article is adapted from The Historic Happing Website with permission."
Manor houses.
Originally there were two Halls in Walcott, East Hall and West Hall. William Faden's map of Norfolk dated 1797 shows Walcott Hall but unfortunately it is not entirely clear if this is West or East Hall. However between 1386 & 1486, there is note of a manor called 'Masons' in Walcott.
Chronology.
The de Walcott family is first noted in East Hall in Walcott during the reign of Henry II (1154 to 1189) when William de Edgefield was living when his mother, Maud de Walcott who granted two parts of the tithe of her lands in Walcott to the monks of Bromholm Priory in Bacton.
Peter de Edgefield, father of William and his wife (Hawise) had a daughter (Letitia) who married Sir William de Rosceline and brought this manor into that family.
In 1240 and possibly 1281, Thomas de Walcott held part of the advowson (income) of Walcott church and was lord of West Hall in Walcott.
In 1286, Peter de Rosceline claimed wreck at sea and frankpledge, he and his wife were living in 1316. Their son, Sir Thomas de Roseceline inherited the manor afterwards.
In 1286, Sir Walter de Walcott held a moiety in Hempstead and was patron of Wallington in 1302. Walter was married to Lucia.
In 1286, Alexander de Walcott, son of Walter de Walcott, and his brother Thomas had 16 messuages, of land, of pasture, of wood in Eccles, Hempstead, Palling and Stalham.
Alexander de Walcott was lord of West Hall in 1302, a lord in Walcott in 1315, and in 1316 he and his wife (Maud) held West Hall.
Alexander de Walcott presented his brother Hugh as Rector of Walcott church in 1302 and presented John de Walcott as Rector of Walcott church in 1322.
There is confusion about whom Alexander de Walcott married. Francis Bloomfield states that in 1333 he was married to Joan and paid 15 marks to the King for an interest in Hempstead. However, he is also noted as being married to Maud and had four daughters called Cecilia, Elizabeth, Mariota and Margaret. Possibly he was married twice.
In 1340 Alexander de Walcott conveyed his right in West Hall in Walcott to Sir Walter de Walcott , his son Alexander de Walcott died in 1341.
Sir Walter de Walcott was a lord in Walcott in 1347 and in 1355 he presented to Walcott church.
In 1347 Simon de Walcott was presented to Walcott church by Thomas de Walcott, Rector of Felbrigg.
Walter married Millicent, daughter and heir of Walter de Gunton and held the manor of Gunton. Walter and Millicent had three daughters – one was Margaret, who married Thomas de Wymondham – and a son, also called Walter .
Sir Walter de Walcott died in 1355.
Sir Walter de Walcott died in 1366. He was married to Joan, daughter of Walter de Clopton. Walter and Joan had four daughters: Elizabeth who married Ralph Bray of Wickhampton; Catherine who married John Durward; Margery a nun of Carrow Priory in Norwich; and Margaret who married Sir Robert Berney of Wickhampton and had the manor of Gunton.
There was a Sir Alexander de Walcott living around 1377, although what relation he was to the above is unknown. Walter Rye states that he was not the brother of Sir Walter de Walcott. Alexander probably married a daughter from the Westingthorpe family and had a daughter who married Andrew Brampton plus a son. This son had a son called John de Walcott of Wallington who had a daughter called Isabel who married Robert Brampton.
The last note of the family in Walcott was in 1377 with Sir Alexander de Walcott.
In 1378 William le Parker sold the manor of Brumstead and the manor of Eccles to Simon de Walcote, Rector of Walcote.

Mobile Tigers

The Mobile Tigers, a semi-professional baseball team composed entirely of African-American players based in Mobile, Alabama, was among the leading teams in the Negro League. It was one of several Negro League teams based in Mobile during the same period and was a training ground for at least three Negro League players who later joined professional teams.
Significant players.
Shortly after leaving a reform school in Mount Meigs, Alabama, Satchel Paige started his career with the Mobile Tigers at age 18. The employed Paige had been job hunting but in his spare time enjoyed watching his older brother Wilson playing for this team. Presenting himself in a try out to "Candy Jim" Taylor, the Mobile Tigers's manager at that time, Paige fired ten fastballs past Taylor. After ten pitches and ten Strikes, Paige got a job with the Mobile Tigers in 1924. According to Paige, the Mobile Tigers paid him "$1 when the gate was good and a keg of lemonade when it wasn't."
According to a sports writer for the "Birmingham-Pittsburg Traveller", Paige's position pitching for the semi-pro Mobile Tigers was the launching pad for "one of the most successful careers in baseball history." After playing for the Mobile Tigers for one year, Paige began his professional baseball career with the Chattanooga White Sox of the Negro Southern League.
Future Negro League stars Ted Radcliffe (as well as his brother Forney) and Bobby Robinson also played on the Mobile Tigers at the same time as Paige. Radcliffe began his professional career with the Detroit Stars and went on to play for the St. Louis Stars, Homestead Grays, Pittsburgh Crawfords (1932), Columbus Blue Birds, New York Black Yankees, Brooklyn Eagles, Cincinnati Tigers, Memphis Red Sox, Birmingham Black Barons, Chicago American Giants, Louisville Buckeyes and Kansas City Monarchs. Robinson moved on to the Pensacola Giants and went on to play for the Birmingham Black Barons, the Chicago American Giants, the Memphis Red Sox, and the Detroit Stars over the next eight years.

Kinesis Myofascial Integration

Kinesis Myofascial Integration (KMI) is a form of Structural Integration (a form of alternative medicine). It involves deep tissue manipulation combined with movement education. KMI Structural Integration is designed to restore structural balance, ease of movement, and a feeling of ‘fitting in your skin’.
History.
KMI is an evolution of the fascial work of Dr. Ida P. Rolf, the movement insights of Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais, the whole-systems geometry of Buckminster Fuller, and many other influences, directed by Thomas Myers.
Myers studied with Ida Rolf between 1975 and her death in 1978, and has practiced Rolfing and been a member of the Rolf Institute since 1976, practicing in more than 10 countries and 16 cities over 30 years in a variety of clinical settings. Searching for a way to teach "connected anatomy", in the early 1990s Myers developed a game of connecting up the muscles in linked series - like the cars on a train - that he called "Anatomy Trains". In 1998, Myers had the insight that Ida Rolf's original Structural Integration "recipe" could be reconfigured in terms of these Anatomy Trains 'lines'. Unable to explore such a radical departure from orthodoxy within the Rolf Institute, Myers started KMI, which continues to explore Structural Integration from the point of view of myofascial continuities.
KMI trains manual therapists in the art and science of Structural Integration in a 500+-hr training that takes place in six sessions over a year's time in various locales around the US and Europe. KMI has about 200 graduate practitioners as of the end of 2008.

Unwanted Cinema

Unwanted Cinema is a documentary film by Petrus van der Let and Armin Loacker that looks at the lives and careers of Jewish filmmakers in Budapest and Vienna during the 1930s after Hitler came to power. "Unwanted Cinema" features Henry Koster, Felix Jackson, Joe Pasternak, Otto Wallburg, Hans Jaray, Franziska Gaal, Rosy Rarsony, Hortense Raky, Oskar Pilzer, Zolan Vidor, Ernst Verebes. The documentary shares clips from their films and interviews with their family.
Summary.
On his American debut, director Henry Koster stood in the lobby waiting to see if the audience would laugh at his film. If they laughed, he knew he could make a career for himself. If they didn’t, he’d have to return to Europe, where he could be killed by the Nazis. The audience laughed uncontrollably. "Unwanted Cinema" profiles Koster and other Jews who were involved in the movie business before and during WWII, as they struggled to preserve both their careers and their lives.
Until the dawn of Hitler, Jewish actors and producers throughout Europe enjoyed critical acclaim and stardom. But once anti-Semitism began to spread, it threatened not only their celebrity but also their lives. Filmmakers and actors moved to Vienna and Budapest where their “unwanted cinema” was produced independently. Later, in hopes of escaping war-torn Europe, many Jews involved in cinema traveled to Hollywood to test their skills and their luck.
The documentary points to both the cruelty and irony of anti-Semitism. Talent that was “unwanted” in Europe because of prejudice was celebrated on the other side of the ocean. The charming clips interspersed throughout the documentary prove the injustice of rejecting Jewish talent. 100 Men and a Girl, which was nominated for five Oscars, is just one example of the exceptional films that these refugees were responsible for.

Miss HIV

Miss HIV is a feature length documentary by Ethnographic Media, released to DVD on August 26, 2008. Written and directed by Jim Hanon (Beyond the Gates of Splendor, End of the Spear), and produced by Mart Green, the film explores the international collision of HIV/AIDS policies while following the journey of two HIV-positive women who enter a pageant in Botswana. What is happening in Botswana, where half of all pregnant women are HIV positive, is set contrasted with the past successes of Uganda, which has experienced one of the largest reductions in HIV infections ever recorded.
Inspiration.
According to Hanon, HIV/AIDS is an almost unimaginable tragedy that everyone acknowledges at some level; but Hanon believes it is largely compartmentalized by those Westerners who have no direct experience with the disease. Hanon wanted to find out why, unlike previous pandemics, people are still dying of a preventable disease. He traveled to the International AIDS Conference in Toronto and found that answering that question meant addressing the issue of controlling sexual behaviors and moral judgement, which is already a point of conflict between many church and homosexual communities. Controlling sex also raises issues of women's rights in parts of the world where women are not able to refuse their partners. 
Producer Mart Green had read a book by Dr. Edward C. Green, which shared the success of the Uganda ABC program (Abstinence, be faithful, use a condom) and how this program is under attack from AIDS activists. Questions emerged about sex, human rights, and ideology. Hanon felt that the Miss HIV pageant in Botswana was a place to explore these questions.

VP-8

Patrol Squadron Eight (VP-8) is a U.S. Navy land-based patrol squadron that was based at the Naval Air Station Brunswick, Maine, but is now stationed at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida. VP-8 is tasked to undertake maritime patrol, anti-submarine warfare (ASW), and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.
VP-8 served as a land-based anti-submarine patrol squadron in the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. VP-8 also became the first operational P-3 Orion squadron in the United States Navy, occurring in October 1962 just prior to the Cuban Missile Crisis.
Squadron History.
World War II.
The lineage for Patrol Squadron 8 can be traced to Patrol Squadron 201 (VP-201), a unit of Fleet Air Wing 5 (FAW-5), which was established at Brunswick Naval Air Station in Brunswick, Maine, on September 1, 1942.
VP-201 underwent flight training at the Naval Air Station Banana River, Florida, beginning October 9, 1942, and the squadron began receiving its new Martin PBM-3C Mariner patrol bomber flying boats starting on December 1, 1942.
VP-201 returned to the Naval Air Station Norfolk on February 6, 1943, following the completion of flight training, and began patrol operations along the Atlantic seaboard as a unit of Task Force 28 within the U.S. Navy Eastern Sea Frontier’s area of responsibility (AOR).
VP-201 began receiving the latest model of Mariner flying boats, the PBM-3S, which featured an improved radar system. Refitted with the PBM-3S aircraft, on May 27, 1943, a six-aircraft detachment was deployed to Naval Air Station Bermuda to protect Allied convoys en route to Europe. Beginning August 1, 1943, the entire squadron was transferred to NAS Bermuda under the administrative control of the Commander Bermuda Air Group
On June 8, 1944, VP-201 was transferred back to NAS Norfolk, and as a unit of Fleet Air Wing Five (FAW-5), began flying personnel and supplies between Norfolk and Bermuda.
Following ASW refresher training, the squadron was transferred to Naval Air Station Coco Solo in the Panama Canal Zone, beginning July 12, 1944, as a unit of Fleet Air Wing Three (FAW-3) under the operational control of the Commander Panama Sea Frontier.
On July 27, 1944, VP-201 was re-deployed to Naval Air Station Key West, and as a unit of Fleet Air Wing Twelve (FAW-12), continued to fly ASW patrol and convoy escort missions. The squadron began outfitting its PBM-3S aircraft with new L-8C Leigh searchlights, and also began rotating to Harvey Point, South Carolina, for replacement aircraft training.
VP-201 was re-designated as Patrol Bomber Squadron 201 (VBP-201) effective October 1, 1944. Starting May 29, 1945, VP-201 finished its wartime service at NAS Coco Solo in the Canal Zone.
In total, during World War II, VP-201 flew more than 28,000 hours as a unit of the U.S. Navy involved in the Battle of the Atlantic.
Cold War.
1946–1949.
On March 1, 1946, the squadron was assigned to Naval Station San Juan, Puerto Rico, under the operational control of Fleet Air Wing (FAW-11). A detachment was sent to Trinidad to serve as a unit of the Air Sea Rescue Task Unit. In June 1947, the squadron was assigned to Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island.
VBP-201 was re-designated as Patrol Squadron 201 (VP-201) effective May 15, 1946, and was subsequently re-designated as Patrol Squadron, Medium Seaplane 1 (VPMS-1) effective November 15, 1946 and Patrol Squadron, Medium Landplane 8 (VP-ML-1) effective June 5, 1947. During December 1947, VP-MS-1 received its first Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune at NAS Norfolk, its new home base, and began the transition to this new aircraft.
The squadron became the second U.S. Navy land-based patrol squadron to be assigned the VP-9 designation when it was re-designated as Patrol Squadron 8 on September 1, 1948. On March 1, 1949, the squadron deployed to Naval Air Station Argentia, Newfoundland, to begin testing the P2V-2 under cold weather conditions.
1950–1959.
VP-8 made its first deployment to NAS Argentia with it new P2V-5F aircraft July 15, 1955 Detachments from the squadron operated out of Goose Bay, Frobisher Bay, and Thule, Greenland, providing air cover to supply convoys for Distant Early Warning (DEW) radar installations.
In April 1958, VP-8 transferred to its new home base at Chincoteague, Virginia, and began operating with Task Force Alfa, a Hunter-Killer (HUK) group created to develop improved ASW tactics and technology by integrating carrier-based ASW aircraft, land-based patrol aircraft, refitted destroyers, and hunter-killer submarines into a single task force structure.
During the next two years, VP-8 actively participated in the evolution of antisubmarine warfare, to including the development and evaluation of new tactics and equipment.
1960–1969.
The VP-8 moved to Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland in July 1961. After relinquishing the last of its P2V-5FS aircraft to the U. S. Naval Reserve in October 1962, VP-8 became the first operational P-3A Orion squadron in the U.S. Navy.
During the Cuban Missile Crisis, VP-8 sent a four-aircraft detachment to Bermuda to support the naval quarantine, including monitoring of Soviet submarines operating in the Caribbean and Eastern Atlantic. VP-8 subsequently deployed detachments to Iceland, Ireland, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and Caribbean bases.
VP-8 made the first trans-Atlantic flight by a P-3 Orion when it flew to West Malling, England, on March 9, 1963. During 1964, VP-8 participated in Fleet Exercise Steel Pike I from bases in Spain. The squadron also began its first P-3B Orion aircraft in December 1965.
VP-8 made its first deployment to the Western Pacific when it relieved VP-28 at Naval Station Sangley Point, Republic of the Philippines, on May 25, 1966. During this deployment, VP-8 carried out combat missions throughout Southeast Asia for the U.S. Seventh Fleet in support of the Vietnam War.
1970–1979.
From 1969 to 1974, VP-8 made several deployments to Bermuda, and it was transferred to its current homeport at Naval Air Station Brunswick, Maine, in July 1971.
From March 1 to March 2, 1972, P-3B Orion aircraft from VP-8 maintained a constant surveillance of the stricken Soviet nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine "K-19" which had been forced to surface because of an onboard fire that broke ot on February 24.
Starting in February 1976, VP-8 closed out the decade with a number of split deployments.
1980–1991.
From 1980 through 1988, VP08 carried out deployments to Rota, Lajes, Bermuda, and Sigonell. Its deployment to Sigonella included VP-8 participating in numerous ASW exercises with detachments operating out of Rota, Souda Bay, Crete, and Nîmes-Garon, France.
Between October 27 to December 8, 1985, a two-aircraft detachment on rotation at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, Puetro Rico, assisted the U.S. Coast Guard in anti-drug interdiction operation the Caribbean Sea.
Operation Desert Storm.
Starting December 31, 1990, VP-8 deployed to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to support carrier battle groups for "Operation Desert Shield" and "Operation Desert Storm", as well as monitor Soviet, Libyan, and Iraqi naval units in the Mediterranean from Naval Air Station Sigonella in coordination with U.S. Sixth Fleet carrier battle groups.
Post-Cold War.
