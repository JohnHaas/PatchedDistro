Chromodoris magnifica

Chromodoris magnifica is a species of nudibranch, a shell-less marine gastropod mollusk in the family Chromodorididae.
Distribution.
This nudibranch is found in the central area of the Indo-Pacific region from Indonesia and the Philippines to New Guinea and Eastern Australia.
Description.
"Chromodoris magnifica" can reach a maximum size of 5 cm length. 
The body is elongate with a foot which is distinct from the upper body by a skirt like mantle hiding partially the foot.
The branched gills and the rhinophores are orange colour and can be withdraw in specific pockets under the skin in case of danger.
The specific epithet "magnifica" in "Chromodoris magnifica" means magnificent, so-named because of this nudibranch's striking, vibrant colors.
The background colour of the body is bluish which intensity varies from a specimen to another.
On the mantle, the bluish area is outlined by two continuous black lines and a median continuous line cross it also. These bluish parts are often marked with dash-like black lines.
The margin of the mantle is bordered with a large white band with a central orange colour line, the width of these lines is variable for each specimen.
The foot has three black continuous longitudinal lines. Its background colour is the same as its mantle. The margin of basis foot is outlined by an orange and a white line.
This species is easily confused with the similar looking "Chromodoris quadricolor". "Chromodoris magnifica" can be distinguished by its submarginal orange border.
Ecology.
"Chromodoris magnifica" feeds on sponges and has been observed feeding on red sponges of the genus "Negombata".

The Bantu Authorities Act, 1951 (Act No. 68 of 1951; subsequently renamed the Black Authorities Act, 1951) was one of the pillars of apartheid in South Africa during the apartheid era. This legislation, succeeding the Native Affairs Act (Act No. 23 of 1920), created the legal basis for the deportation of blacks into designated homeland reserve areas and established tribal, regional and territorial authorities. This Act was augmented by the Bantu Homelands Citizens Act of 1970.
After the end of apartheid, with the introduction of democratic local government and a new framework for traditional leadership, the act became obsolete, and it was formally repealed in 2010.

John Vincent (composer)

John Nathaniel Vincent, Jr (May 17, 1902 – January 21, 1977) was an American composer, conductor, and music educator. 
He was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and studied at the New England Conservatory of Music under Frederick Converse and George Chadwick graduating with a diploma in 1927. He continued his studies at George Peabody College where he earned a bachelors and a masters degree followed by doctoral studies at Harvard University from 1933–1935. While at Harvard studying under Walter Piston he won the John Knowles Paine Traveling Fellowship for two years of study with Nadia Boulanger. After transferring to Cornell University he earned his PhD in 1942. Vincent was head of the music department at Western Kentucky University from 1937–1945 and Schoenberg’s successor as professor of composition at UCLA, a position he held from 1946–1969. He died in Santa Monica, California in 1977.
As a composer, Vincent's music is known for its rhythmic vitality and lyricism. Although his music is essentially classical in form it is distinctly individual. The free tonality of his work makes use of what he calls ‘paratonality’: the predominance of a diatonic element in a polytonal or atonal passage. Vincent wrote numerous orchestral works, chamber music pieces, art songs, and choral works. He also wrote one ballet, "3 Jacks" (1942), a film score, "Red Cross" (1948), and an opera, "Primeval Void" (1969).
In 1951 his book "The Diatonic Modes in Modern Music" was published. He also conducted orchestras throughout the USA and South America, and he was a director of the Huntington Hartford Foundation from 1952–1965.

Fred R. Klenner

Frederick Robert Klenner (October 22, 1907 – May 20, 1984) was an American medical researcher and doctor in general practice in Reidsville, North Carolina. From the 1940s on he experimented with the use of vitamin C megadosage as a therapy for a wide range of illnesses, most notably polio. He authored 28 research papers during his career. He was one of the originators of orthomolecular medicine, but his work remains largely unaddressed by established medicine. Klenner is the subject or mentioned or referenced in a number of orthomolecular medicine related papers and articles. A recent book broadly updating Klenner's cumulative vitamin C work is dedicated to him and he is profiled in "Medical Mavericks". Some of his work is presented in free book about intervenuous vitamin C.
Life.
Klenner was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania on October 22, 1907 to Mary (née Bewak) and Frank Klenner, the youngest of their eight children. His parents had come to this country from Austria as children. When Fred was born, Frank and Mary were living on a farm near Johnstown, although his father Frank continued to work at Bethlehen Steel Corp. where he had worked since a young man. In 1908, his sister Gertrude died at the age of 16 from respiratory problems which were suspected of being caused by the smoke pollution in the skies from Johnstown's blast furnaces. It was said that he was a smart child, some said the smartest of all the Klenner children, sensitive and earnest. In his free time he enjoyed playing in an Austrian band and could play several instruments including the cornet, violin, harpsicord, zither and piano. Klenner attended St. Vincent College for two years and St. Francis College now Saint Francis University, Loretto, Pennsylvania where he received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in biology in 1931. He graduated with honours and was awarded a teaching fellowship. He was also awarded the college medal for scholastic philosophy. He then took another teaching fellowship in chemistry at Catholic University, where he studied for his doctorate in physiology.
He graduated from Duke University, School of Medicine in 1936. After three years of hospital training and his marriage to Annie Hill Sharp, sister of Susie Sharp, he entered private medical practice in her hometown of Reidsville, North Carolina. He continued to work there all his life.
In 1946, in Reidsville, North Carolina, he delivered the "Fultz Quadruplets", the world's first recorded set of identical black quadruplets and the first quadruplets to survive in the Southern United States. He subsequently brokered a 'corporate adoption' by Pet Milk, a Saint Louis dairy, which provided a foster home, foster care, living expenses, a farm, clothes, medical and dental care through majority in return for promotional rights. All were born under Klenner's noteworthy high vitamin C maternity regimen for over 300 births.
Vitamin C studies.
Klenner's main subspecialty was diseases of the chest, but he became interested in the use of very large doses of Vitamin C in the treatment of a wide range of illness. Many of his experiments were performed on himself. In 1948, he published his first paper on the use of large doses of Vitamin C in the treatment of virus diseases. 
In 1949 Klenner published in and presented a paper to the American Medical Association detailing the complete cure of 60 out of 60 of his patients with polio using intravenous sodium ascorbate injection Galloway and Seifert cited Klenner's presentation to the AMA in a paper of theirs. Generally, he gave 350 to 700 mg per kilogram body weight per day. 
He described giving up to 300,000 milligrams (mg) per day of neutral pH sodium ascorbate. Klenner published 27 medical papers, most about vitamin C applications for over 30 diseases, two about treatment of severe neuropathies including multiple sclerosis using aggressive supplementation. He wrote a 28th paper ca 1980, an unpublished update about MS treatment. It was posthumously summarized by Lendon Smith in the "Clinical Guide to the Use of Vitamin C".
His maxim: the patient should ""get large doses of vitamin C in all pathological conditions while the physician ponders the diagnosis.""
He inspired Linus Pauling and Irwin Stone to expand the research on the wider benefits of Vitamin C. In the foreword of the "Clinical Guide", Linus Pauling wrote: ""The early papers by Dr. Fred R. Klenner provide much information about the use of large doses of Vitamin C in preventing and treating many diseases. These papers are still important.""

Armar Lowry-Corry

Rear Admiral Armar Lowry Corry (1793 - 1 May 1855, in Paris) was a British naval officer.
Naval career.
Corry entered the Royal Navy on 1 August 1805, became a Lieutenant on 28 April 1812, a Commander on 13 June 1815, and Captain on 23 July 1821. From 1835 to 1839 he was captain of HMS "Barham" on the coast of Spain and in 1844-45 served in the Channel Squadron as Captain of HMS "Superb". Promoted to Rear-Admiral on 8 March 1852, he was employed "in command of the Western Squadron" until 1853. He commanded the Channel Squadron from 24 May that year until February 1854, flying his flag in HMS "Prince Regent". He was then assigned as second-in-command to Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Napier, who was to command the British fleet in the Baltic. While Napier left for the Baltic with the steam ships of the line, Corry, flying his flag in HMS "Neptune", followed some weeks later with the division of ships powered only by sail. He fell ill during the campaign and was invalided home, but never fully recovered and died in Paris on 1 May 1855.
In 1817 Corry visited Egypt as the captain of his brother's yacht "Osprey". There he and his brother, Lord Belmore, of Enniskillen, visited such sights as the Temple of Dendur, where Corry inscribed his name as graffiti in the Temple of Dendur. It can be seen today prominently inscribed at the Temple, which resides at the New York Metropolitan Museum. The inscription reads: "A L Corry RN 1817" ("RN" stands for "Royal Navy").
Family.
In 1842 he married Elizabeth Rosetta Massy-Dawson.

Tom Patterson (cartographer)

Tom Patterson is a cartographer working for the United States National Park Service in Harper's Ferry, West Virginia. He has developed several widely used open-source tools and bases for cartographers.
His earliest public work aside from maps for the Park Service was a set of papers in 1997 and 1998 explaining techniques for generating shaded relief using Adobe Photoshop and Bryce.
In 2000, he explored ways of digitally producing panoramic maps like those of Heinrich Berann.
In 2005, he released the open-source Natural Earth database, which combines land-use data with shaded relief for land and ocean areas. It was inspired by the cartography of Hal Shelton. A second release in 2007 (Natural Earth II) used more generalized land-use information based on natural rather than human-made landscapes.
In 2006 he released plan oblique relief, inspired by Erwin Raisz's physiographic map. These maps are in "2.5 dimensions", allowing the relief equivalent of an axonometric plan. His resulting physical maps of the world and the United States are, as with Natural Earth, free for public use.
In 2007 he released Flex Projector together with Bernhard Jenny (cartographer at the ETH Zurich), an open-source tool to develop pseudocylindrical projections, including his own Natural Earth projection.

Ricardo Calvo

__FORCETOC__
José Ricardo Gomez Calvo (October 22, 1943 – September 26, 2002) was a Spanish chess player, doctor, author, reporter, and chess historian, who was awarded the title of International Master in 1973 and played for Spain at the Chess Olympiads of 1966, 1968, 1972 and 1974. He died in 2002 from esophageal cancer.
Early life.
Calvo spoke fluent Spanish, German, and English. As a chess historian, Dr. Calvo set out to prove that Spain was central to the monumental changes that occurred in chess late in the fifteenth century. It is most widely believed that the increased powers of the queen and the bishop were introduced during the Renaissance in Italy; however, Calvo insisted that Spain played a major role.
Politics.
Dr. Calvo was deeply involved in chess politics. In 1987, he was condemned by FIDE and declared ""persona non grata"" (Latin: "An unwelcome person") by a vote of 72-1, for writing a controversial article in "New in Chess". The article, according to FIDE, was a "racial attack on Latin Americans". In response, Calvo wrote a letter to FIDE titled "On the Nature of FIDE Legitimacy" in which he disputed their decision: 
Notable Games.
Ricardo Calvo vs Viktor Korchnoi.

Nb3 Ba7 7. c4 Nc6 8. O-O Qh4?!, a dubious move by Korchnoi that will allow his queen to be targeted: 9. N1d2 Nge7 10. c5 Ne5 11. Be2 b6 12. f4 N5c6 13. Nc4 bxc5 14. g3 Qh6 15. f5 Qf6 16. fxe6 Qxe6 17. Nd6+ Kf8 18. Bc4!, now Korchnoi will lose his queen or be checkmated, so resigns: 1-0.
Ulf Andersson vs Ricardo Calvo.
This game, played in 1997, was between Ulf Andersson and Ricardo Calvo: 1.Nf3 d5 2.c4 d4 3.g3 Nc6 4.d3 e5 5.Bg2 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 a5 7.O-O Nge7 8.a3 Bd6 9.Ne4 Ng6 10.e3 Be7 11.exd4 exd4 12.Nfg5 h6 13.Nh3 O-O 14.f4 f5 15.Neg5 hxg5 16.Bd5+ Rf7 17.Qh5 Qd6 18.Re1 Bd7 19.fxg5 Nce5 20.Nf4 Ra6 21.Bd2 Bf8 22.Rac1 c5 23.h4 Nh8 24.Qe2 Ng4 25.h5 g6 0-1.

Annals of Quedlinburg

The Annals of Quedlinburg (, ) were written between 1008 and 1030 in the convent of Quedlinburg Abbey. In recent years a consensus has emerged that the annalist was a woman.The annals are mostly dedicated to the history of the Holy Roman Empire; they also contain the first written mention of the name of Lithuania ("Litua"), dated to 1009. The original document has disappeared, surviving only as a 16th-century copy held in Dresden, but its contents endure as a scholarly resource.
Background.
The city of Quedlinburg, Germany, was first mentioned in writing in a document dated to 922. Saint Mathilda founded a religious community for women at its abbey, serving as abbess from 966 to 999. The abbey became a premier educational institution for the female nobles of Saxony, and maintained its mission for nearly 900 years. The city served as an imperial palatinate of the Saxon emperors, where Henry the Fowler, the founder of the Ottonian dynasty, was buried. Quedlinburg was situated not far from Magdeburg, the Royal Assembly of the empire, and its annalists could therefore rely on genuine information from the royal house and obtain eyewitness accounts. The city lost some stature under the rule of Henry II, who broke with the tradition of celebrating Easter there; the Annals portray him unfavorably, and demonstrate the extent to which a royal monastery was entitled to criticize its monarch.
Annals.
The Annals open with a chronicle of world history from the time of Adam to the Third Council of Constantinople in 680-681, based on chronicles by Jerome, Isidore, and Bede. The narrative is largely borrowed from multiple older sources until the year 1002, although original reports from as early as 852 are present. Beginning in 993, the narrative begins including events which represent the annalist's own eyewitness testimony concerning events at and around Quedlinburg. The amount of detail increases significantly from 1008 onwards, leading some analysts to conclude that 1008 was the actual date that the Annals were first compiled, although Robert Holzman argues for a start date of 1000. It has been suggested that the annalist temporarily abandoned the project between 1016 and 1021. The exact reasons for this suspension of the work are unknown. Work on the project continued between 1021 and 1030, when its authors were able to report a military victory against Mieszko II.
The primary task of the annalists was to record the heritage of the Ottonian dynasty and of Quedlinburg itself. The Annals incorporate the stories of a number of historic and legendary figures such as Attila the Hun, King Dietrich of the Goths, and others. The historian Felice Lifshitz has suggested that amount of saga material integrated into its narrative is without parallel.
The Annals of Quedlinburg became an important research source; during the 12th century they were used at least by five contemporary historians. Felice Lifshitz asserts that the Annals of Quedlinburg played a key role in shaping the ways in which influential Germans of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw their medieval past. They continue to be analyzed in other contexts: by scholars of Beowulf discussing its use of the term "Hugones" to mean Franks, by climatologists, and in a book discussing fear of the millennium.
Mention of Lithuania.
The first written occurrence of Lithuania's name has been traced to the Quedlinburg Annals and dated to 9 March 1009. The passage reads:
From other sources that describe Bruno of Querfurt, it is clear that this missionary attempted to Christianize the pagan king Netimer and his subjects. However, Netimer's brother, refusing to accept Christianity, killed Bruno and his followers. The historian Alfredas Bumblauskas has suggested that the story records the first baptismal attempt in the history of Lithuania.

<doc id="19132559" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19132559" title="Version targeting">
Version targeting

In computing, version targeting is a technique that allows a group of (presumably knowledgeable) users (including software developers) to utilise some advanced software features that were introduced in a particular software version while allowing users accustomed to the prior versions to still utilise the same software as if the new features were never added to the software. It is a way to ensure backwards compatibility when new software features would otherwise break it.
The term "version targeting" is mostly applied in the context of Web browsers, although the concept is not limited to any specific kind of software application. In Web browsers, a DOCTYPE declaration serves a similar purpose.
In Mozilla Firefox.
Version targeting has been used in Mozilla Firefox when it introduced JavaScript 1.6 in Firefox 1.5 and JavaScript 1.7 in Firefox 2.0: developers willing to use the new scripting engine had to explicitly opt-in.
Use in Internet Explorer.
Version targeting was proposed by Microsoft for use in its Internet Explorer 8 product-in-development, but the idea was later discarded.
The proposal came after the release of Internet Explorer 7 which improved its CSS 2.1 support at the cost of causing some websites that were developed for Internet Explorer 6 to be rendered incorrectly when viewed with the new browser version.
Microsoft contacted the Web Standards Project and experts on Web standards and asked for assistance in devising a new DOCTYPE-like technique that could work across browsers and let Web developers specify exact browser versions under which their Web sites are known to work correctly, and browsers implementing this form of version targeting would utilise the correct rendering engine versions to display the site correctly. Members of the WaSP Microsoft Task Force were involved in the proposal, albeit not every member backed it.
Some commentators suggested that it would be possible to use Internet Explorer 8's support for new DOCTYPEs in order to avoid using its version targeting meta tag.
Criticism.
The concept of version targeting, especially as proposed by Microsoft, has been criticised for being a new form of browser sniffing and for violating the principle of forward-compatible development where progressive enhancement is preferred.
Version targeting has been criticised for not giving incentives to developers to plan ahead for forward compatibility.
Positive reception.
Version targeting has been welcomed by some people as a means to enable browsers to adopt Web standards without breaking compatibility with Web sites depended on old rendering engines for their functionality.

The Prussian T 13 was a series of tank locomotives built in large numbers for the various German state railways, notably the Prussian state railways, and the Deutsche Reichsbahn during the early part of the 20th century.
T 13.
The physically identical T 13 locomotives of the Prussian state railways, the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine and the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways were goods train, tank locomotives with an 0-8-0T wheel arrangement. They were primarily employing on shunting duties. Between 1910 and 1916 a total of 512 were built by various manufacturers for the Prussian state railways. As a result of heavy losses after the First World War, another 72 were ordered by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and 12 by the Saar Railways which were delivered in 1921 and 1922. The Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine also had 60 T 13s and Oldenburg had ten of this class. 
They were incorporated in 1925 into the DRG renumbering plan for steam locomotives as DRG Class 92.5–10 and given operating numbers 92 501–913 and 92 1001–1072. Of these, numbers 92 585–588, 92 606, 92 607, 92 910–913 were locomotives that originated in the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways and 92 732–738 from the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine. 
In 1935, locomotives 92 919–950 were transferred from the Saar Railways to the Deutsche Reichsbahn. In 1943 they were joined by a further five locomotives from the "Zschipkau-Finsterwald Railway Company" with numbers 92 991–995. During the Second World War, numbers 92 951–990 and 996 from Poland and 92 1101–1112 from Czechoslovakia were added. The Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany) took over in 1950 locomotives 92 6401 and 92 6501–6504 from private railways. Numbers 92 6502–6504 were T 13s that had been procured directly by the "Brandenburg Städtebahn".
The Deutsche Bundesbahn retired the last engine in 1965 at Kassel locomotive depot ("Bahnbetriebswerk" or "Bw"); the Reichsbahn followed suit in 1968.
Four representatives of the D-h2t Class 92.10 remained in Austria after the Second World War. These were numbers 92 1052, 1055, 1063 and 1068. The ÖBB retained their serial numbers but grouped them into ÖBB Class 792. All the engines in this class had been retired by 1962.
T 13.1.
In the early 1920s, the newly founded Reichsbahn ordered 13 of the proven T 13 engines in a superheated variant, the T 13.1, for the Oldenburg division (the former Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways) and Altona division. They were goods train, tank locomotives with a 0-8-0T wheel arrangement and were subsequently incorporated into the Deutsche Reichsbahn's renumbering plan as DRG Class 92.4 with operating numbers 92 401–413.
The Saar Railways, too, procured five T 13.1s in 1922 from Krauss in Munich, which were however somewhat different. Amongst other things, they had a differently designed driver's cab and additional equipment on top of the boilers. They were numbered by the Reichsbahn as 92 414–418.
Other former private railway locomotives, that were numbered as 92 421, 92 431–437 and 92 441 and 442 by the Reichsbahn were "not" Prussian T 13.1s.
The engines remaining in the western zones of occupation after the Second World War were sold by 1948 to private railways.
T 13 Hagans variant.
The T 13 Hagans Variant built for the Prussian state railways was also a goods train, tank engine, with an 0-8-0T wheel arrangement, but had "Hagans" driving gear. The firm of Hagans in Erfurt developed this design with a split locomotive frame in order to achieve better curve running qualities. In the main frame were located the two front driving axles, whilst the rear two, were housed in a swivelling frame and driven via a specially developed arrangement of levers by the front axles. The "Hagans" T 13 was built as a smaller version of the Prussian T 15 by the firm of Henschel from 1899to 1902. It was delivered to the railway divisions of Erfurt, Saarbrücken, Magdeburg and Frankfurt am Main. Unfortunately its complicated construction proved to be very maintenance-intensive, which had a negative impact on its economy. As a result the locomotives were retired as early as 1923. Two similar engines had been supplied by Henschel to the Baden state railways as the Class VIII d.
The Deutsche Reichsbahn grouped five of these locomotives into its 1923 renumbering plan as 92 501–505, but in 1925 they were no longer in service.
T 13 Mallet variant.
Within the T 13 class of locomotives were also the five Mallet tank engines that were taken over on 1 January 1913 along with the Bergheimer Kreisbahn and Mödrath-Liblar-Brühler railway west of the Rhine. This handful of B'B n4vt engines was acquired by the Royal Prussian Railway Division of Cöln (Cologne) and they were numbered as Cöln 7946–7950. They were the only Mallet tank locomotives in Prussia. At the same time several locomotives of the Hohenzollern version were delivered to the Filderbahn and Moselbahn. The Cologne engines were retired in 1920/21.

WISE Campaign

The WISE Campaign (Women into Science, Engineering and Construction) encourages women and girls to value and pursue Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths or Construction related courses in School or College and move on into related careers and progress. Its mission statement aims to facilitate understanding of these disciplines among women and girls and the opportunities which they present at a professional level. 
One of WISE's main objectives is to listen to students and women qualified or working in these sectors, and understand and voice their opinions to academic institutions, policy-makers and employers. It then works creatively with delivery agencies and others, offering models, tools and approaches to support them in challenging traditional approaches, so as to demonstrate equitable involvement. WISE combats gender stereotypes to get more girls and women involved in careers where female participation was once considered near impossible.
WISE operates throughout the UK, with specialist committees in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Volunteers, from industry and relevant organisations, attend the various WISE committee meetings, and undertake projects with WISE.
In 2011 the UKRC - an organisation specialising in gender equality in science, engineering and technology - took on leadership of WISE. WISE counts The Princess Royal, The Baroness Platt of Writtle, Dame Julia Higgins, Kate Bellingham and Joanna Kennedy as its patrons.

Luigi Giuliano

Luigi Giuliano (born 1949) is a former Italian Camorrista who was the boss of the powerful Giuliano clan, based in the district of Forcella, Naples. He had multiple nicknames including ""'o rre"" and ""Lovigno"", which is an amalgamation of Luigi and love. In 2002, he decided to collaborate with Italian law enforcement and became a "pentito", a co-operating witness against organised crime.
Early life.
Giuliano was born into the family of Pio Vittorio Giuliano, a well-known smuggler. Pio Vittorio Giuliano had 11 children. Six boys, Luigi "o re or the king", Guglielmo "o stuorto or the crooked one", Nunzio Giuliano, Carmine "o lione or the lion" (1952-2004), Salvatore "o montone or the ram", Raffaele "o zui", Neapolitan slang for being the youngest son. The other four girls, Erminia Giuliano, who was called Celeste, Patrizia, Silvana and Anna. Nunzio dissociated himself from the Camorra and, by extension, his own family in the eighties, following the drug-related death of his son. In later years, he fought to keep young people away from the Camorra, and was about to publish a book containing numerous interviews and anti-Camorra appeals which were directed towards the people of Campania, before he was killed on March 21, 2005.
At the age of 14, Giuliano stole a car belonging to an American expatriate together with Giuseppe Misso, the future boss of the Misso clan. His father found a briefcase containing hundreds of US dollars in the car. Pio Vittorio Giuliano was a powerful member of the Giuliano clan, which had traditionally controlled the Forcella, or ""Casbah"" area in the centre of Naples. Luigi Giuliano replaced his father as head of the clan in the mid-1970s.
War with the NCO.
The Giuliano clan was on such bad terms with rival mobster Michele Zaza that it launched an attack against his nephew Pasquale in December 1979. The Giuliano clan had been in good terms with the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, headed by Raffaele Cutolo until the first half of 1979, but the two clans then broke out into conflict. Cutolo demanded to receive a cut from the Giulianos' illegal gambling centres and lottery system in his power base of Portici. Following this, the Vollaro clan leader named Luigi Vollaro raised the idea of an anti-Cutolo alliance with Giuliano. A provisional death squad was set up, which contributed to the dozens of gangland deaths that year.
The breaking point was reached when the NCO tried to move into the Giulianos' stronghold of Forcella, Piazza Mercato and Via Duomo, in the centre of Naples. A few days before Christmas, 1980, two NCO members presented themselves at an unloading of contraband cigarettes at Santa Lucia and demanded immediate payment of $400,000 to their organization, as well as insisting on future payment of $25 for every crate of cigarettes brought ashore. They then proceeded to shoot and injure one of the Giuliano gang members unloading the cigarettes. On Christmas Eve, Luigi Giuliano himself was wounded in an attack.
Nuova Famiglia.
The clash, which had occurred in a period of growing tension, led to the formation of the Nuova Famiglia (NF) to oppose Cutolo’s predominant NCO, consisting of Giuliano, Zaza, the Nuvolettas and Antonio Bardellino from Casal Di Principe (the Casalesi clan). After the defeat of Cutolo, the leaders of the NF achieved absolute dominance over all criminal rackets in the city of Naples. Luigi Giuliano relinquished control of the Quartieri Spagnoli (Spanish Quarters) to the Di Biase brothers, Luigi and Mario who ruled the area under the approval of Giuliano. He later became a founding member of the Secondigliano Alliance, a consortium of Camorra clans formed in Naples towards the end of the 1980s.
Arrest.
Luigi Giuliano held the reins of his clan undisturbed for nearly thirty years. However, he was arrested in early 2000 and was succeeded by his sister, Erminia, who was ranked as one of Italy's 30 most dangerous criminals, and eventually arrested after being a fugitive for over 10 months. She became the boss because the only direct male heir to the family business still unimprisoned, Giuliano's nephew Pio Vittorio Giuliano, was deemed inept.
In January 2001, his wife Carmela Marzano was arrested and charged with threatening the widow of Giuseppe Ginosa, a rival Camorrista. She wanted to testify against Giuliano's son-in-law and two associates accused of murdering her husband in 1999. Their daughter, Marianna, was also arrested.
Pentito.
In September 2002, Giuliano decided to collaborate with the Italian authorities and became a government witness. He cited his willingness to change his life as a reason for his collaboration with the authorities. The former boss revealed many secrets and revealed details which opened several branches of investigation, some of which are still ongoing. The information divulged featured corrupt police officers, corrupt judges, rigged auction houses, and complacent courts. He even made several statements against his former ally, Giuseppe Misso, and revealed specific details regarding the murder of the Vatican's banker Roberto Calvi, who was found hanging from scaffolding beneath Blackfriars Bridge in the financial district of London in 1982.
Luigi Giuliano's collaboration with the Italian authorities was preceded by that of his two brothers, Guglielmo and Raffaele. In retaliation for the defection of the three Giuliano brothers, Nunzio Giuliano was killed by the Camorra during an ambush at the Via Tasso in Naples in 2005, followed by Luigi Giuliano's son Giovanni on December 7, 2006. Giovanni had previously refused to join the Witness Protection program.

<doc id="19132676" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19132676" title="Zhang Gao">
Zhang Gao

Zhang Gao (張鎬) (died 764), courtesy name Congzhou (從周), formally the Duke of Pingyuan (平原公), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Suzong. He was known for his blunt suggestions, which eventually led to his removal as chancellor.
Background.
It is not known when Zhang Gao was born, but it is known that his family was from Bo Prefecture (博州, roughly modern Liaocheng, Shandong). His great-grandfather Zhang Shanjian (張善見), grandfather Zhang Wuding (張武定), and father Zhang Zhigu (張知古) all served as prefectural-level officials.
Toward the end of "Tianbao" era (742-756) of Emperor Xuanzong, the chancellor Yang Guozhong wanted to retain talented men on his staff. He summoned Zhang and, after meeting him, recommended Zhang to be "Zuo Shiyi" (左拾遺), a low-level official at the examination bureau of government (門下省, "Menxia Sheng"). After the general An Lushan rebelled in 755 and established his own state of Yan, Yang often consulted Zhang on military matters, and it was at the recommendation of Zhang and another consultant, Xiao Xin (蕭昕), that Yang made another official, Lai Tian (來瑱), a general, and Lai enjoyed some successes against Yan forces. In summer 756, Yan forces approached Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to flee toward Chengdu. Zhang followed Emperor Xuanzong on foot to Chengdu.
During Emperor Suzong's reign.
Emperor Xuanzong's son and crown prince Li Heng, however, did not follow him to Chengdu but fled to Lingwu instead, where he was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong of Tang). When the news reached Emperor Xuanzong, he recognized Emperor Suzong as emperor and took the title of "Taishang Huang" (retired emperor). He sent a number of officials, including Zhang Gao, to attend to Emperor Suzong, and in 757, Zhang reached Emperor Suzong's makeshift court at Fengxiang (鳳翔, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). As Emperor Suzong was impressed by Zhang's suggestions, he made Zhang "Jianyi Daifu" (諫議大夫), a consultant at the examination bureau. He soon further promoted Zhang to be "Zhongshu Shilang" (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau (中書省, "Zhongshu Sheng") and gave him the designation "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor "de facto". At that time, Emperor Suzong retained several hundred Buddhist monks to recite sutras day and night, hoping to draw divine favor, and their voices carried within and without the makeshift palace. Zhang, wanting to end the practice, spoke to Emperor Suzong:
Emperor Suzong was said to agree with his words, but historical accounts did not indicate whether the practice stopped. Meanwhile, as Emperor Suzong believed Zhang to be capable in both civilian and military matters, he soon made Zhang the military governor ("jiedushi") of Henan Circuit (河南, roughly modern Henan and Shandong) and commander of the forces in the region, replacing Helan Jinming (賀蘭進明). Zhang knew that, at that time, the general Zhang Xun and the city that he was defending, Suiyang, were under heavy siege, and he therefore tried to march his troops at twice the speed to try to save Suiyang. He also ordered the generals in the region to report to Suiyang to try to save it, but by the time that he arrived in the locale, Suiyang had already fallen, and Zhang Xun was killed by the Yan general Yin Ziqi (尹子奇). In anger, Zhang Gao summoned one of the generals who had disobeyed his order and who had refused to try to save Suiyang, Luqiu Xiao (閭丘曉) and executed Luqiu by caning. Subsequently, after a joint Tang and Huige force recaptured the Tang eastern capital Luoyang (the force had recaptured Chang'an earlier), Zhang and five military governors under his command, Lu Jiong (魯炅), Lai Tian, Li Zhi (李祇) the Prince of Wu, Li Siye, and Li Huan (李奐), recaptured the commanderies throughout the Henan and Hedong (河東, i.e., modern Shanxi) region, except for two commanderies where the Yan generals Neng Yuanhao (能元皓) and Gao Xiuyan (高秀巖) held out. He was created the Duke of Nanyang.
Meanwhile, Tang forces were putting An Lushan's son and successor An Qingxu under siege at Yecheng, and with the siege proceeding and the last major remaining Yan general, Shi Siming, submitting his post of Fanyang (范陽, in modern Beijing) to Tang, it appeared that the realm would be soon peaceful. However, Zhang distrusted Shi, believing that Shi was merely buying time and would soon rebel himself; he thus advised Emperor Suzong to use extreme caution with regard to Shi. He also distrusted another Tang general, Xu Shuji (許叔冀) and suggested that Emperor Suzong recall Xu to the capital. However, Emperor Suzong trusted the reports of eunuchs he sent to meet with Shi and Xu, which stated that both Shi and Xu were trustworthy. In spring 758, Emperor Suzong thus removed Zhang from his posts as chancellor and military governor, instead sending him to Jing Prefecture (荊州, roughly modern Jingzhou, Hubei) to serve as its defender. (Zhang's warnings proved to be prescient, however, as Shi soon rebelled, and after Shi's forces had some preliminary victories over Xu, Xu surrendered to him.) Zhang was soon recalled to serve on the staff of Emperor Suzong's crown prince Li Yu and "Zuo Sanqi Changshi" (左散騎常侍), a high-level advisor at the examination bureau. In 761, however, after a plot to make Emperor Suzong's cousin Li Zhen (李珍) the Prince of Qi emperor was discovered, as Zhang had previously purchased a mansion from Li Zhen, he was considered Li Zhen's associate. Emperor Suzong thus exiled him to Chen Prefecture (辰州, roughly modern Huaihua, Hunan) to serve as the census officer.
During Emperor Daizong's reign.
Emperor Suzong died in 762, and Li Yu succeeded him (as Emperor Daizong). Emperor Daizong pardoned many officials who had been punished during Emperor Suzong's reign, and he made Zhang Gao the prefect of Fu Prefecture (撫州, roughly modern Fuzhou, Jiangxi). He soon made Zhang the prefect of Hong Prefecture (洪州, roughly modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) as well as the commander of the forces in the seven prefectures around Hong Prefecture. He also created Zhang the Duke of Pingyuan. Subsequently, when forces under the agrarian rebel Yuan Chao (袁晁) were disturbing the region, Zhang led his own forces at Shangrao (上饒, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi) and defeated Yuan's forces, killing several thousand. He also killed two other significant agrarian rebels, Yang Zhao (楊昭) and Shen Qianzai (沈千載). Zhang was thereafter made the governor (觀察使, "Guanchashi") of Jiangnan West Circuit (江南西道, roughly modern Jiangxi). He died in 764.
It was said that, despite Zhang's meteoric rise -- becoming chancellor within three years of being a civilian -- he was respected for his honesty and humility, as well as his willingness to open himself to his subordinates and good insight. Therefore, despite his lack of seniority, he was respected as any other senior official.

Photometric stereo

Photometric stereo is a technique in computer vision for estimating the surface normals of objects by observing that object under different lighting conditions.
The technique was originally introduced by Woodham in 1980. The special case where the data is a single image is known as shape from shading, and was analyzed by B. K. P. Horn in 1989.
Methods.
Under Woodham's original assumptions — Lambertian reflectance, known point-like distant light sources, and uniform albedo — the problem can be solved by inverting the linear equation formula_1, where formula_2 is a (known) vector of formula_3 observed intensities, formula_4 is the (unknown) surface normal, and formula_5 is a (known) formula_6 matrix of normalized light directions.
Photometric stereo has since been generalized to many other situations, including non-uniform albedo, extended light sources, and non-Lambertian surface finishes. Current research aims to make the method work in the presence of projected shadows, highlights, and non-uniform lighting.

Anything (Eric Burdon and The Animals song)

"Anything" is a song performed by Eric Burdon & The Animals in 1967. It was featured on their psychedelic rock album "Winds of Change". While the singles "San Franciscan Nights", "Good Times" and the album were released, "Anything" was also released as a single, peaking #80 on the United States pop singles chart. Allmusic critic Bruce Eder described it as a "relatively straightforward, brooding, moody rocker."
The song is credited to Vic Briggs, Eric Burdon, Barry Jenkins, Danny McCulloch and John Weider. This song is the one Burdon is most proud of writing. He described it as a "love-generation song". He explained; "It's more than just a song about a love for your woman; it's about love for everything, from the Earth, to your friends, and even your enemies." In 1995, Burdon re-recorded the song. It was featured on "Absolutely the Best" (1999).

USS Tracer (AGR-15)

USS "Tracer" (AGR-15) – also known as USS "Interrupter" (AGR-15) – was a "Guardian"-class radar picket ship acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1957 from the "mothballed" reserve fleet. She was reconfigured as a radar picket ship and assigned to radar picket duty in the North Pacific Ocean as part of the Distant Early Warning Line.
Because of the closeness of the sound of names issued for radar picket ships at the time, "Interrupter" had her name changed by the Navy to "Tracer" so as not to confuse her with and 
Liberty ship built in Florida.
"William J. Riddle" -- a "Liberty ship"; -- was laid down under a U.S. Maritime Commission contract (MC hull E-2340) on 24 December 1944 at Panama City, Florida, by the J. A. Jones Construction Co., Inc.; launched on 31 January 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Marion Harders; and, upon completion in early 1945, was delivered to the War Shipping Administration, Maritime Commission.
World War II-related service.
"William J. Riddle" operated with Moore-McCormack Lines and the Waterman Steamship Corporation from 1945 to 1947. When hostilities ended in the Par East in mid-August 1945, the "Liberty ship" was steaming from Hawaii to the Philippines. 
Converted to a cattle carrier the following year, she operated as such through the end of 1946. Changed back to a dry cargo carrier by March 1947, she voyaged to European and Mediterranean ports until the summer of 1947 when she was laid up in the U.S. Maritime Commission's National Defense Reserve Fleet and berthed in the James River, Virginia. She remained there for 10 years.
Conversion to radar picket ship.
The Navy selected "William J. Riddle" for conversion to a radar picket ship in May 1957. Towed to the Charleston Naval Shipyard (South Carolina) soon thereafter, conversion work began on 24 May 1957. Renamed "Interrupter", and classified as "AGR-15", the erstwhile "Liberty" was commissioned at Charleston, South Carolina, 16 October 1958, Lt. Comdr. George S. Harrison in command.
Following shakedown in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and post-shakedown availability at her conversion yard, "Interrupter" sailed for the Pacific Ocean. She transited the Panama Canal on 26 January 1959 and arrived at her home port, San Francisco, California, on 12 February, the sixth "AGR" to join newly formed Radar Picket Squadron 1.
Fitted out with the latest radar detection equipment, "Interrupter" and her seven "Guardian"-class sister ships were designed to serve as the seaborne eyes of the North American Air Defense Command -- the naval link in the chain of early-warning stations covering the Pacific approaches to the United States. Her mission was to "detect, report, and track enemy airborne threats approaching by overseas routes and to control the intercepts used to destroy such threats."
Before putting to sea for her first patrol, she conducted training evolutions with U.S. Air Force officers embarked on board for familiarization with the ship's mission. In addition, "Interrupter's", officers and men familiarized themselves with the Air Force's part in this vital mission. On 6 March 1959, "Interrupter" sailed from San Francisco on her first barrier patrol.
Solving the name problem.
On 4 September 1959, "Interrupter" was renamed "Tracer" to eliminate confusion with some of her sister ships with similarly sounding names.
Between 1959 and 1965, "Tracer" conducted patrols at sea, at various picket stations in the Western Contiguous Radar Line. The ship proved to be an efficient vessel and received awards for administrative and operational efficiency on several occasions. As more sophisticated early-warning systems came into operational use, the need for the "AGR's" diminished accordingly.
Deactivation.
Deactivated in 1965, "Tracer's" name was struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1965. She was then transferred to the U.S. Maritime Commission and laid up at Suisun Bay, California, where she remained until sold, 15 July 1974. Before being scrapped in China in 2000, "Tracer" – renamed "Unisea" – served as a fish processing plant in Unalaska, Alaska.
Honors and awards.

Erard of Brienne-Ramerupt

Érard de Brienne (c. 1170 † 1246) was a French nobleman. He was lord of Ramerupt and of Venizy, and also a pretender to the county of Champagne as an instigator of the Champagne War of Succession. He was a son of André of Brienne and of Alix of Vénizy.
Early ife.
He was born in Ramerupt, Aube, Champagne, France.
A social-climber from a minor branch of the Brienne family, Erard actually held no lands in Brienne and had little just cause to appropriate the name "of Brienne" for himself. His grandfather Erard II of Brienne had indeed ruled as count of Brienne. Andre, the fourth son of Erard II, was the father of Erard of Brienne-Ramerupt. Erard was actually lord of Ramerupt, which wasn't very impressive compared to the holdings of the more senior branches of the Brienne family. Within his own letters, Erard thus tried to enhance his prestige by consistently referring to himself as "Erard of Brienne" and not even mentioning Ramerupt. The name "Erard of Brienne-Ramerupt" is retroactively applied by historians for the sake of clarity.
While Andre was the fourth son of Count Erard of Brienne, his second son - and thus Erard of Brienne-Ramerupt's uncle - was the famous crusader knight John of Brienne (1170-1237), who in 1210 wed the heiress Maria of Jerusalem to become the nominal King of Jerusalem by marriage (albeit, the crusaders had lost control of the city of Jerusalem itself by this point). Perhaps seeking to emulate the success of his uncle, who found great prestige traveling to the east and marrying a powerful heiress, thus in June 1213 he left Champagne for the Latin East with the stated intention of marrying Philippa of Champagne, the younger half-sister of Maria of Jerusalem.
The War of Succession of Champagne.
The line of succession of the counts of Champagne had become complicated in the current generation. Count Henry I had two sons with Marie of Champagne, Henry II and Theobald III. Henry II succeeded as count on his father's death, but left France within a few years to fight in the Third Crusade. Before he left in 1190, Henry II had his barons swear that should he never return, his younger brother Theobald III was his designated heir. The problem was that Henry II never returned from the Latin East, but instead chose to marry the then-heiress to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Queen Isabella I - eight days after the assassination of her husband Conrad of Montferrat, which Henry II might possibly have had a hand in orchestrating. Moreover, Isabella I was already visibly pregnant with Conrad's child - Maria of Jerusalem, who later married John of Brienne - thus the marriage was considered scandalous by many. Henry II fathered two daughters with Maria, Queen Alice of Cyprus and Philippa. 
Henry II died in a fall from a balcony seven years later in 1197. Since 1190, Henry II's mother Marie had been ruling Champagne as regent, and continued to do so past Henry II's death on behalf of her younger son Theobald III until her own death the following year in 1198. Technically, Henry II's young daughters were the rightful heirs to Champagne in line of succession. However, their family made no attempt to press the claim and return to Champagne. Theobald III, in contrast, was living in Champagne and already eighteen years old (slightly short of the unusually late age of majority in Champagne at twenty-one years old). Particularly, the barons of Champagne had sworn to recognize Theobald III as Henry II's heir should he not return to Champagne, never considering that Henry II would choose to stay in the Latin East and father children there. Thus when Marie died in 1198, Theobald III succeeded her as count of Champagne, with the mediation and approval of King Philip II Augustus, to whom Theobald III officially swore homage. Theobald III died of a sudden illness only three years later in May 1201, but he left behind his young and heavily pregnant wife Blanche of Navarre. Blanche already had an infant daughter with Theobald III, but quickly traveled to Philip II's court to implore him to recognize her unborn child's claim if it was a son, citing the agreements Henry II's barons had sworn to recognize Theobald III as his heir should he not return. Blanche formally performed the homage ceremony with Philip II, and a week later indeed gave birth to a son, Theobald IV. Given that local custom in Champagne stipulated that the age of majority was twenty-one (unusually late compared to other regions of France), all knew that Champagne was now in the vulnerable position of facing a twenty-one year-long regency under Blanche, under a young and inexperienced Basque-speaking foreign princess. Blanche and Theobald IV were already in a vulnerable position, but it was known that Henry II left daughters behind in the Latin East who were technically ahead of Theobald IV in the rightful line of succession. 
Perhaps inspired by his uncle John's marriage to Maria of Jerusalem, in June 1213 Erard announced his intention to travel to the Latin East to marry Maria's younger step-sister Philippa. He returned to Champagne with his new bride in January 1216. Armed clashes soon broke out, and the War of Succession of Champagne began.
King Philip II imposed a truce in April 1216 to put a stop to the fighting, and held a court at Melun in July 1216 to hear Edard and Philippa's case. Unfortunately for Erard, the court ruled that because Theobald III had already done homage for Champagne to the king for several years, yet Philippa and her family never challenged his succession in all that time, Henry II's daughters could no longer make a claim for the inheritance. Blanche again presented the signed agreements of Henry II's barons which swore that Theobald III was to be his heir if he never returned from the crusade. Unsatisfied, Erard returned to open rebellion in spring 1217. Erard gathered to himself a large number of barons from the fringes of Champagne or from old and powerful aristocratic families, who were not pleased with the increasing efforts of Theobald III and Blanche to bring them all under centralized control. Most of Erard and Philippa's supports came from the fringes of Champagne, along the southern and eastern borders, away from the core territories of "Champagne and Brie" in the west. One of Erard's major supporters was Simon of Joinville, hereditary seneschal of Champagne and leader of one of the most powerful noble families in the county. Further, Erard allied with Theobald I, Duke of Lorraine, significantly bolstering the rebel faction.
By 1218, however, the tide had turned, as Blanche secured papal excommunications against the rebel lords, and gained the support of the neighboring duke of Burgundy and count of Bar. Further, Blanche allied with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II to counterbalance Duke Theobald I of Lorraine. By May 1218 Blanche and her army rode with Frederick II's forces to Lorraine's capital of Nancy and burned it to the ground. By June 1218, the rebellion had largely collapsed and individual lords began to make their own separate peaces. Erard and Philippa established a truce agreement in July 1218, which ultimately lasted the rest of Blanche's regency until 1222, during which time other rebel lords continued to haggle for better peace terms. 
Blanche offered peace on generous terms to Erard and Philippa, wanting to end the challenge to her son's rule as quickly as possible. Erard received a surprisingly large payment of 4,000 livres, with a lifetime rent of 1,200 livres.
Only after the war ended, when hope of becoming count of Champagne was lost, did Erard stop the charade of presenting himself as "Erard of Brienne". Instead, after 1222, he would specify in his letters that he was "Erard of Brienne, lord of Ramerupt".
Later Life.
Despite losing the war, on the whole Erard did quite well for himself. He had started out as a grasper from a minor branch of the Brienne family, clinging to a name he didn't technically have the right to use because it enhanced his social prestige. The massive payoff that Blanche gave Erard in the peace agreement that ended the war, however, propelled him to a place alongside the highest level of regional barons. Erard used his newfound wealth to buy up lands surrounding his own, so that he was able to cobble together his own larger barony. By 1227, he even bought up the other half-share of Ramerupt - he had only owned a half-share of his own castle up to this point - uniting it under his sole possession.
Erard did not intervene against Theobald IV during the difficult invasion of other northern barons of France in 1229, because anticipating that Erard might try to challenge him again, Theobald IV bought him off with a 200 livre fief, and in return had to swear to surrender his castles of Ramerupt and Venizy until the invasion was over.
Erard died at roughly the age of sixty in 1243. All that he had striven to achieve for himself and his children, however, evaporated within only a few years. Both of his sons died on the Seventh Crusade in 1250, and his wife Philippa died that same year. Erard had six daughters, one of whom had predeceased him without issue and another who became a nun. Ramerupt was subsequently divided into quarters between the remaining four daughters, whose husbands absorbed the lands into their own separate lordships.
Marriage and issue.
Erad married Philippa of Champagne, they had the following children:
Philippa died on 20 December 1250, a little more than six years after her husband. She was aged about fifty-three.

Anselm Haverkamp (born July 18, 1943) is a German-American professor of literature and philosophy. He received his academic education in Freiburg/Brsg, Zurich, Bonn and Konstanz. After his PhD in Heidelberg and his Habilitation in the Konstanz School of Criticism, he moved from Konstanz to Yale; since 1989 he has taught as professor of English at New York University, where he also founded the Poetics and Theory Program. Since 1994 he has served as founding member of the newly established European University Viadrina in Frankfurt an der Oder, East of Berlin. In 2009, he was made a Honorary Professor of Philosophy at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. 
Haverkamp was a member and co-editor of the research group Poetik und Hermeneutik in its later phase, 1979-1996. Under the influence of the Yale School of deconstruction (Paul de Man, Jacques Derrida), he developed the Konstanz School's Rezeptionsästhetik (Wolfgang Iser, Hans Robert Jauß, Wolfgang Preisendanz) from a theory of literary response (Reader-response criticism) to a theory of literary latency. Relevant parts of this theory are the theory of metaphor or metaphorology, including the history of rhetoric and historical epistemology, as well as the relationship of philosophy and literature. 
Main references of his work include the Poetics of Aristotle, the Rhetoric of Quintilian, the Aesthetics of Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten, as well as the work of Benjamin and Derrida, Hans Blumenberg and Stanley Cavell. Relevant literary authors include Ovid, Shakespeare and Keats, Hölderlin, Joyce and Beckett. 
More recently, Haverkamp has extendes the theory of latency into the fields of historical epistemology, art theory and legal studies. He is a regular contributor and editor of "Texte zur Kunst" (Berlin) und "Law and Literature" (Berkeley).

It was produced by Chorokbaem Media as a 47th Anniversary Special Project Drama for Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC). It aired on MBC from August 25, 2008 to March 10, 2009 on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 for 56 episodes. The drama tells the story of the brothers Dong-chul (Song) and Dong-wook (Yeon). Their fates diverge after the murder of their coal miner father, with one joining the mob and the other becoming a successful lawyer. 
Plot.
A period epic that spans the years 1960 to 2000, "East of Eden" tells a saga of the bitter rivalry between two men who are eternally bound by fate.
Shin Tae-hwan (Jo Min-ki) is the managing director of a coal mine in Taebaek. The true embodiment of ruthless ambition, he strives to inherit the coal mining company Taesung Group. In the process, he kills Lee Ki-chul (Lee Jong-won), a miner crusading for worker's rights who has been blocking his path to success. He also seduces Yoo Mi-ae (Shin Eun-jung), a nurse at Taebaek Hospital, only to coldly brush her away after he's tired of her.
At the same moment that Yang Chun-hee (Lee Mi-sook), wife of the deceased Ki-chul, is giving birth to a son at Taebaek Hospital, Shin Tae-hwan's wife also gives birth to a baby boy. Filled with rage at Shin Tae-hwan's betrayal, the nurse Mi-ae comes up with a scheme to fulfill her own revenge. She switches the two babies. By doing so, she viciously transforms the fates of not just two lives, but those around them.
Years later, Chun-hee's sons Lee Dong-chul (Song Seung-heon) and Lee Dong-wook (Yeon Jung-hoon) are the closest of brothers. To alleviate their poverty, Dong-chul becomes a gangster, while the younger Dong-wook dreams of becoming a prosecutor to help the family seek revenge on Shin Tae-hwan. Two women enter Dong-chul's life: the smart and sensible Min Hye-rin (Lee Da-hae), and Gook Young-ran (Lee Yeon-hee), the willful daughter of his gang boss (Yoo Dong-geun). Meanwhile, Shin Myung-hoon (Park Hae-jin), who's been molded in his father Tae-hwan's spiteful, selfish image, sets his eye on Kim Ji-hyun (Han Ji-hye), Dong-wook's sweetheart.
Until a revelation shakes Dong-chul to his core: that his real brother was raised by Shin Tae-hwan and that the beloved brother that had been beside him all these years is actually the son of his enemy.
International broadcast.
The series aired in Japan on TBS in 2009. Selected scenes were also screened in theaters, free of charge, in eight major Japanese cities including Osaka, Sapporo, Fukuoka and Hiroshima over 23 sessions in October 2008.

André of Brienne

André de Brienne (c. 1135 – 4 October 1189), lord of Ramerupt, was a French nobleman of the Third Crusade.
Life.
He arrived in the Holy Land on 28 August 1189 to participate in the Siege of Acre with the first French troops, which he led alongside James of Avesnes, Henry I of Barres and Philip of Dreux. On 4 October that year, Saladin launched a new attack against the crusader army besieging the town. The battle was quickly won by the crusaders, but when they had victory within their grasp the crusaders' camp descended into anarchy and began to flee. André of Brienne, in command of the rearguard, tried to stop the fleeing crusaders and send them back into battle, but he was thrown from his horse. Covered in injuries, his screams of despair did not move his companions, not even his brother Erard, as they fled, leaving him to die there. 7000 other crusaders were also killed in this battle, including Gerard of Ridefort, grandmaster of the Templars.
Family, marriage and issue.
He was the son of Gautier II of Brienne, comte of Brienne and his second wife. The identity of his mother is debated. Some believe her to be Humbeline, the widow of Anseric de Chacenay. Others believe her to be the daughter of Jean de Soissons & his wife Aveline de Pierrefonds.
In around 1167 he married Adélais of Trainel-Venisy (daughter of Anseau of Vénisy). They had 5 children :

Take the Train

Take the Train is a card game marketed by the U.S. Playing Card Company under its Bicycle Games sub-brand. The object of the game is to have the most train fares remaining at the end of the game; train fares are distributed evenly among players, and are lost when a player cannot play from their hand and for each card left when a player empties their hand.
Setup.
The game includes:
Players choose the dealer by some fair means. For the normal game, the Transfer cards are removed, but they can be left in for a more advanced variation. The dealer shuffles while the train fares are distributed evenly (any remainder is placed in the tray, known as the Conductor's Pot). The dealer then deals the cards face-down, one at a time; 13 cards each for 2 or 3 players, 8 for 4 or more. The remaining cards are placed face-down to form the draw pile, known as the Conductor's Hand.
Play.
Starting on the dealer's left, a player checks to see if they have a Station card. If so, they play it to start the first line. If not, their turn passes (they do "not" need to pay a Fare at this time). If no player has a station, players draw in turn until one is found (again, not yet paying fares).
Once the first Station has been played, that line is open. Players in clockwise fashion proceed to make one of the following plays per turn:
Ending the game.
The game is over when one player empties his hand of cards, or alternately if a player runs out of Fares. All other players pay one Fare to the pot for each card, and the player with the most Fares left wins.
Multi-round play.
The game can be played in rounds, with score kept based on the number of Fares the winning player had left. Play can then be to 100 or 250, or the highest total after a number of rounds.
Specialty Cards.
Free Ride.
A Free Ride card is a wild card that can stand in for any one number card (it cannot be a specialty or Station card). As the number card it stands in for exists, a player may, on their turn, play the card for which the Free Ride is standing in, and take the Free Ride for their own use. This counts as the play for their turn.
End of Line.
An End of Line card, when placed on one end of a line, prohibits players from adding to that side of the line. To play cards that would normally be played on that end, the players must instead "wrap around" the other end of the line. For instance, if the End of Line was played on the 8 of a line, the 9 of that color, which would normally be played on the 8, instead becomes the last card that can be played on that line; the descending side must "wrap around" from 1 to 12 to 11 etc. until the 9 can be played.
Transfer.
A Transfer card, used in more advanced variants, allows a player to "split" a line by branching off a sequence of a differing color, beginning from a card of which the player holds a card of the same number in a different color. For instance, with the Magenta line open, a player may not have a playable Magenta card, but DOES have an Orange 5 and a Transfer card, and the Magenta 5 has been played. The player plays the Transfer card next to the Magenta 5, then plays the Orange 5 on the other side. Orange cards 4 to 1 can now be played off of the 5 heading away from the station. Any cards that would normally lie between the Station and the number at which the Transfer was played, as well as anything to the other side of the Station, cannot be played until the Station is played.

Frank King (British Army officer)

General Sir Frank Douglas King GCB MBE (9 March 1919 – 30 March 1998) was a British Army officer who was General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the British Army in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles. He held a number of other senior posts in the British Army, having begun his military career in the ranks during the Second World War.
Early life and Second World War.
King was born on 9 March 1919 in Brightwell, which was then in Berkshire, where his parents, Arthur and Kate King, were farmers. He was educated at Wallingford Grammar School, and but for the outbreak of the Second World War would have carried on the family farm. Initially in the ranks of a Territorial Army unit, he was commissioned into the Royal Welch Fusiliers as a second lieutenant on 4 July 1940. Now a war substantive lieutenant, he briefly transferred to the Royal Fusiliers from 14 June 1941, and then to the Reconnaissance Corps on 15 July, and finally to the Parachute Regiment on 19 October 1943. He participated in Operation Market Garden, and was wounded and taken prisoner of war at Arnhem.
Post-war.
King was selected for staff training, and was one of the first students to pass through the Royal Military College of Science, Shrivenham Technical Staff course in 1946; he was then granted a regular commission as a lieutenant in the Wiltshire Regiment on 22 February 1947 (with seniority from 7 November 1941), and he was subsequently promoted to captain from the same date (with seniority from 1 July 1946). 1947 also saw his marriage to Joy Emily Ellen Taylor-Lane. In 1950 he passed the General Staff course at Staff College, Camberley, he also qualified as pilot, He was promoted major on 7 May 1953 (with seniority from 9 March 1953). For two years prior to this he had served as a General Staff Officer Grade II in the Infantry Directorate at the War Office, working on standardisation of infantry weapons with his Belgian, Canadian and American counterparts, this work led to his appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1953 Coronation Honours. He transferred back to the Parachute Regiment on 31 May 1958, serving as second-in-command of the 1st battalion. After a brief spell as Assistant Military Secretary at the War Office, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 1 April 1960, and became commanding officer of 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, based in Cyprus and Bahrain, and also during its participation in the British intervention in Kuwait.
King was promoted colonel on 10 December 1962, and then commanded the 11th Infantry Brigade group, based at Minden in Germany, from 1963–65. He became Military Adviser (Overseas Equipment) in the Ministry of Defence in 1965, and was promoted brigadier on 17 December 1965, continuing in the same role for the rest of 1966. On 1 January 1967 he was promoted Major-General and appointed Director, Land/Air Warfare, and Commandant of the Army Air Corps. On 5 August 1968 he became Director, Military Assistance Overseas, back at the Ministry of Defence, stepping down on 15 May 1969. He was then appointed Commandant of the Royal Military College of Science on 10 July 1969, and in the 1971 New Year Honours was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB), he relinquished the post on 1 October 1971. It was widely expected that given his technical background he would become Master-General of the Ordnance; but his command experience was equally strong and as a result, on promotion to lieutenant-general on 1 November 1971 (with seniority from 2 February 1971), he was appointed General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Army Strategic Command, and in the 1972 New Year Honours was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). The home commands were abolished in 1972, and so on 1 April King became Deputy Commander-in-Chief UK Land Forces, subordinate to General Sir Basil Eugster, the Commander-in-Chief, he stepped down on 15 January 1973.
Northern Ireland.
On 1 February 1973 King succeeded Sir Harry Tuzo as GOC Northern Ireland and Director of Operations. This was the worst period of the Troubles, nearly 12,000 bombing and shooting incidents had occurred the year before King's appointment, but by the end of his period in command, the figure was down to just under 2,500 a year. His obituary in "The Times" states that he "was regarded by many as the best and most successful Director of Operations in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s", though it also notes that he himself would be happy to attribute much of the preparatory work to Tuzo (who has been described in similar terms). His success was attributable to a number of factors: he regularly visited the troops on the ground which gave him a good picture of the difficulties faced in particular areas; once a unit or commander had proved itself, he was happy to delegate considerable authority, in particular to his immediate subordinate, Commander Land Forces (Sir) Peter Leng; he had a good relationship with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Merlyn Rees, who said of King "You have never played at politics and I have never played at being a soldier; that's why we have got on so well." He was replaced in the post by Lieutenant-General Sir David House on 1 August 1975. King was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 1976 New Year Honours.
Later career and retirement.
On 20 January 1976, King was granted local rank as general, and appointed Commander NATO Northern Army Group and Commander-in-Chief British Army of the Rhine, again succeeding Tuzo. He was promoted to substantive general on 16 March 1976 (with seniority from 1 September 1975). He delivered the Kermit Roosevelt lectures in the United States' staff colleges in 1977, and relinquished his appointment on 30 September 1978, and retired from the army on 27 December 1978.
In addition to his command roles, King held the largely honorary appointments of colonel commandant of the Army Air Corps from 1 November 1974 to 1 January 1980, and of Aide de Camp General to the Queen from 1977 to his retirement.
Following his retirement from the army, he served as a director and company chairman for a variety of firms, was chairman of the Arnhem Veterans' Association, and kept in close contact with the Parachute Regiment. He died on 30 March 1998, and was honoured with a memorial service at the Royal Garrison Church, Aldershot Garrison on 8 June 1998.

Irving M. Binik

Yitzchak M. "Irv" Binik (born February 6, 1949) is an American-Canadian psychologist whose main research interest is human sexuality, specifically sexual pain (vaginismus and dyspareunia).
Career.
In 1970, Binik earned B.A. in History from New York University and a B.H.L. in Jewish Studies from the Jewish Theological Seminary. He then studied experimental psychopathology and Clinical Psychology at University of Pennsylvania, earning a M.A. in 1972 and a Ph.D. in 1975, following a Clinical Internship at Warneford Hospital's Department of Psychiatry at University of Oxford in 1974-1975. His dissertation was on circadian rhythms and escape learning in the laboratory rat.
He has taught at McGill University since 1975 and has been a full professor since 1992. He coordinates the Sex and Couple Therapy Service of Royal Victoria Hospital, part of the McGill University Health Centre in Montreal. Binik is a fellow of the Canadian Psychological Association and a diplomate of the American Board of Sexology. In 2003 Binik was awarded the Canadian Psychological Association prize for 
distinguished contribution to professional psychology. In 2006, he received the Masters and Johnson 
Award for lifetime achievement from the Society for Sex Therapy and Research. 
Much of his research has focused on sexual response in women, including women who have experienced menopause. Binik reported that sexual response in women and men was not markedly different in terms of speed.
Binik has also studied male sexual response, reporting that circumcision may not affect sensation.
He has written on how sexual pain should be reclassified from a sex disorder to a pain disorder in the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders". In 2008, Binik was selected for the "DSM-V" Sexual & Gender Identity Disorders Work Group chaired by Kenneth Zucker.

HotShot (video game)

HotShot is a pinball/breakout game published in 1988 for 8-bit and 16-bit platforms.
Two competitors play with a ball, in an arena which is split into two halves with breakable blocks on both sides. The aim is to get a higher score than your opponent by breaking more blocks on your side than your opponent does. Competitors are in the form of humanoids, robots and aliens, all of which have a 'gun' of some sort enabling them to take control of the ball. The range of arenas have several pinball-style flippers which make the ball bounce off at unpredictable angles. The game can be played as one player versus a computer player (controlled with good AI for its time), or as two players competing against one another. Players can suck the ball into their gun then fire it at their blocks for points, or deliberately shoot the ball into their opponent to make them lose points. When hit, players disintegrate but instantly re-spawn with control of the ball going to the opponent.
There are six characters to choose from: Maxx, a humanoid armed with a magnetic gun to control the ball; Wobbly, an alien blob of slime with eyes on stalks who sucks in and fires the ball with his elephant-like trunk; Triffid, a tripedal robot with a magnet gun built into his head; Killer, a bipedal robot with a magnet gun for a head; Tojoi, a humanoid holding a magnet gun in a spacesuit with large 80s shoulder pads; Yuri, physically identical to Maxx but with different abilities.

John Eliot Howard

John Eliot Howard (11 November 1807 – 22 November 1883) was an English chemist of the nineteenth century, who conducted pioneering work with the development of quinine. 
Howard was born in Plaistow, London, the son of Luke Howard a noted meteorologist, chemist and Quaker. He worked at the family pharmaceutical manufacturing business of Howards and Sons. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1874.
He was the author of scientific works including "The Quinology of the East Indian Plantations (1869–1876)", religious works including a commentary on the book of Hebrews and histories including "The Island Of The Saints", about the Reformation in Ireland.
Howard was originally a Quaker, but became connected with Christians meeting at the new Brooks Street Meeting House in Tottenham, now Brook Street Chapel, which was founded in 1838–1839 by a number of other Christians including Howard's brother Robert; his father Luke (the 'namer of clouds') helped to finance the building of the Chapel: a portrait of the father and son hangs in the National Portrait Gallery.
Howard married Maria Crewdson on 9 September 1830 and the couple had seven children, including Joseph Howard, who was later Liberal MP for Tottenham. The family lived at Lord's Meade, Lordship Lane, Tottenham. Howard died in Edmonton, London at the age of 76 and is buried in Tottenham Cemetery. One of his grandchildren was the ornithologist, Henry Eliot Howard.
The genus "Howardia" of the "Rubiaceae" was dedicated to him.

<doc id="19133309" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19133309" title="EID2">
EID2

EP300 interacting inhibitor of differentiation 2, also known as EID2 is a human gene.
Function.
The protein encoded by this gene may function as an endogenous suppressor of TGF-beta signaling and inhibits differentiation by blocking the histone acetyltransferase activity of p300, class I histone deacetylase, HDACs. The N-terminal portion of EID-2 was required for the binding to HDACs. This region was also involved in the transcriptional repression and nuclear localization, suggesting the importance of the involvement of HDACs in the EID-2 function. EID-2 inhibits TGF-beta/Smad transcriptional responses. EID-2 interacts constitutively with Smad proteins, and most strongly with Smad3. Stable expression of EID-2 in the TGF-beta1-responsive cell line inhibits endogenous Smad3-Smad4 complex formation and TGF-beta1-induced expression of p21 and p15.
EID-2 displays developmentally regulated expression with high levels in adult heart and brain. Overexpression of EID-2 inhibits muscle-specific gene expression through inhibition of MyoD-dependent transcription. This inhibitory effect on gene expression can be explained by EID-2's ability to associate with and inhibit the acetyltransferase activity of p300.

Joe Bageant

Joe Bageant (1946–2011) was an American author and columnist known for his book "Deer Hunting With Jesus".
Life and Work.
Bageant was originally raised in Winchester, Virginia. He left Winchester and worked as a journalist and editor. In 2001, Bageant moved back to Winchester.
In "Deer Hunting With Jesus: Dispatches From America's Class War" Bageant discusses how Democrats have lost the political support of poor rural whites and how the Republican Party has convinced these individuals to "vote against their own economic self-interest." The book is mainly centered on his hometown, Winchester.
In 2010, Bageant published a similarly themed book, "Rainbow Pie: A Redneck Memoir". Bageant used his extended family’s post WW II years experience to describe the social hierarchy in the United States of America. The book examines the post-war journey of 22 million rural Americans into the cities, where they became, the author argues, the foundation of a permanent white underclass and comprise much of today’s heartland “red state” voters.
Bageant frequently appeared as a commentator on radio and television internationally, and wrote a progressive online column distributed to hundreds of blogs and websites. He maintained his own blog, called Joe Bageant, and also served as a senior (roving) editor with Cyrano's Journal Today and The Greanville Post, two sites devoted to progressive political and media analyses.
Death.
During the last years of his life, Bageant lived in Mexico. He had been living in Ajijic, Mexico where he wrote "Rainbow Pie," when he learned that he had a fast growing and inoperable cancer. On January 4, 2011, Bageant announced on his web site that he had been "struck down by an extremely serious form of cancer" which was inoperable and was unable to engage in correspondence or his usual work, but hoped to be able to resume them in the future.
After Joe died, his Australian publisher asked Bageant's literary executor, Ken Smith, to select and edit about 80,000 words worth of Joe's essays. This book was published in November 2011 as "Waltzing at the Doomsday Ball: The Best of Joe Bageant". Upon its original publication, this posthumous collection was only available in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa where, according to Smith, it sold reasonably well. According to Smith: "no American publisher is yet interested in a book by a redneck socialist -- and that says a lot about American culture and the US book business." When his friends at "The Greanville Post" learned about the seriousness of his condition, he was unanimously voted as Editor Emeritus of the publication .
On March 27, 2011, it was announced on his website that he had died on March 26 following "a vibrant life" and a four-month struggle with cancer.

Cowboys &amp; Aliens (comics)

Cowboys & Aliens is a 100-page Platinum Studios 2006 graphic novel created by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg and written by Fred Van Lente and Andrew Foley, with illustrator Dennis Calero and penciler Luciano Lima.
Publication history.
Platinum Studios founder & chairman Rosenberg created the "Cowboys & Aliens" concept in 1997, describing it as a "graphic novel in development. In 2006 Platinum Studios Comics published the "Cowboys & Aliens" original graphic novel.
Plot synopsis.
In 1873, gunslingers Zeke Jackson and Verity Jones are hired to protect a caravan that is heading to Silver City, Arizona, to work at a silver mine. They are ambushed by Apache Indians in the desert and the two groups witness the crash-landing of an alien spaceship. Its inhabitants, led by Commander Rado Dar, exterminate some of the Indians, allowing Zeke and Verity to escape, as the aliens set out to conquer the planet Earth. While the aliens regroup and destroy a nearby fort, Zeke and Verity arrive at Silver City with the settlers, only to discover that, aside from a handyman named Alan Cross (the original founder and mayor of the city), most of the town's inhabitants left after it was discovered that the silver mines were empty.
The cowboys are attacked by aliens riding in flying motorcycle-like vehicles and are chased to a cliff, where they are rescued by Apache Indians led by Chief Medicine Crow and the warrior Warhawk, who ambush the aliens. The two groups decide to join forces in order to defeat the aliens, and scavenge the fallen ones for weapons. Zeke steals a microwave-emitting pistol, Verity steals an energy whip, Warhawk steals X-Ray goggles and the other Indians steal explosives that they attach to their arrows. A blacksmith uses the scraps of the motorcycles to forge anti-gravity horseshoes that allow the Indians to ride on flying horses.
The humans also receive the assistance of Commander Dar's assistant, Ra Chak Kai, who has switched sides and falls in love with Zeke. She reveals that the aliens (who call themselves The Caste) have taken over Silver City and are building a communication device that will allow them to call in troops from their homeworld to enslave the entire Earth. Verity and Warhawk also fall in love. Cross offers to lead a decoy group on a frontal attack against the aliens, allowing a second group led by Zeke to infiltrate the city through the empty silver mines and attack. Cross betrays them, in hopes of being spared by the aliens. The humans are captured, including Cross, who, despite his treachery, is thrown in with the other human prisoners and is killed by Verity. The captured humans are set for execution at dawn, just as the beacon is about to send its transmission, but the rest of the Indians arrive on their flying horses and defeat most of the aliens. Zeke and Kai kill Commander Dar while Verity and Warhawk deal with his second-in-command and destroying the aliens' communications tower. As the humans celebrate their victory, Kai is secretly revealed to be part of a race of shapeshifting aliens that have organized a resistance against the Caste warlords. For their bravery, the humans are added to the list of races with the strength needed to stand against the Caste.

Jackson Police Department (Mississippi)

The Jackson Police Department provides law enforcement services to approximately 185,000 citizens encompassing of Jackson, Mississippi. JPD is composed of approximately 430 sworn officers who are supported by over 250 civilian personnel.
Brief history.
The Jackson Police Department was established in 1822. 
An ordinance dated January 1864 set a policeman's wages at $40.00 per month, with the exception of the city marshall who received half the fee paid by each person put in jail. Off-duty police officers took the ferry below LeFleur's Bluff across the Pearl River into what is now Rankin County to bring back firewood to sell. 
Eventually, pay was raised to $60.00 per month for men working twelve-hour shifts, seven days a week. There were no holidays, vacation days or days off.
1873 marked the appearance of the first uniformed police officers with caps, badges, and batons. 1878 marked the turning point of specialized police services, when the first police detective was appointed. In 1901, "patrol" became a rank, and men were hired for that position. In 1909, "desk sergeants" were appointed, along with mounted police, and detectives wore plain clothes for the first time. In 1917, greatly expanded specialized bureaus and divisions were formed. Early police communications were strictly one-way. The transmitter and radio operator were located at City Hall with the call letters WAMK. Officers had to depend on "call boxes" located on light poles in the downtown area to reply. It was 1952 when the department occupied a modern headquarters building at 327 East Pascagoula Street. This allowed the Jackson Police Department to operate both a municipal court and jail from one location. 
The Police Training Academy was constructed in 1965 to consolidate instruction and training of personnel. The pistol range, included as a part of the training academy, was built on East McDowell Road. In 1972, the first female officer was sworn in. In 1978, the city's growth prompted the police department to move to the precinct system. 
There are now four precincts. In 1979, officers were provided with individual walkie-talkies which gave them an emergency distress button. In 1983, the size of the department grew to over 400 sworn police officers. In 2005, Shirlene Anderson was sworn in as the first female chief of police.

<doc id="19133401" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19133401" title="Google Chrome">
Google Chrome

Google Chrome is a freeware web browser developed by Google. It used the WebKit layout engine until version 27 and, with the exception of its iOS releases, from version 28 and beyond uses the WebKit fork Blink. It was first released as a beta version for Microsoft Windows on September 2, 2008, and as a stable public release on December 11, 2008.
As of 2013, StatCounter estimates that Google Chrome has a 39% worldwide usage share of web browsers, making it the most widely used web browser in the world.
In September 2008, Google released the majority of Chrome's source code as an open source project called Chromium, on which Chrome releases are still based. Notable components that are not open source are the built-in PDF viewer and the built-in Flash player.
History.
Google's Eric Schmidt opposed the development of an independent web browser for six years. He stated that "at the time, Google was a small company," and he did not want to go through "bruising browser wars." After co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired several Mozilla Firefox developers and built a demonstration of Chrome, however, Schmidt admitted that "It was so good that it essentially forced me to change my mind."
Announcement.
The release announcement was originally scheduled for September 3, 2008, and a comic by Scott McCloud was to be sent to journalists and bloggers explaining the features within the new browser. Copies intended for Europe were shipped early and German blogger Philipp Lenssen of Google Blogoscoped made a scanned copy of the 38-page comic available on his website after receiving it on September 1, 2008. Google subsequently made the comic available on Google Books and mentioned it on their official blog along with an explanation for the early release.
Public release.
The browser was first publicly released for Microsoft Windows (XP and later versions) on September 2, 2008 in 43 languages, officially a beta version.
On the same day, a CNET news item drew attention to a passage in the Terms of Service statement for the initial beta release, which seemed to grant to Google a license to all content transferred via the Chrome browser. This passage was inherited from the general Google terms of service. Google responded to this criticism immediately by stating that the language used was borrowed from other products, and removed this passage from the Terms of Service.
Chrome quickly gained about 1% usage share. After the initial surge, usage share dropped until it hit a low of 0.69% in October 2008. It then started rising again and by December 2008, Chrome again passed the 1% threshold.
In early January 2009, CNET reported that Google planned to release versions of Chrome for OS X and Linux in the first half of the year. The first official Chrome OS X and Linux developer previews were announced on June 4, 2009 with a blog post saying they were missing many features and were intended for early feedback rather than general use.
In December 2009, Google released beta versions of Chrome for OS X and Linux. Google Chrome 5.0, announced on May 25, 2010, was the first stable release to support all three platforms.
Chrome was one of the twelve browsers offered to European Economic Area users of Microsoft Windows in 2010.
Development.
Chrome was assembled from 25 different code libraries from Google and third parties such as Mozilla's Netscape Portable Runtime, Network Security Services, NPAPI, Skia Graphics Engine, SQLite, and a number of other open-source projects. The V8 JavaScript virtual machine was considered a sufficiently important project to be split off (as was Adobe/Mozilla's Tamarin) and handled by a separate team in Denmark coordinated by Lars Bak at Aarhus. According to Google, existing implementations were designed "for small programs, where the performance and interactivity of the system weren't that important", but web applications such as Gmail "are using the web browser to the fullest when it comes to DOM manipulations and JavaScript", and therefore would significantly benefit from a JavaScript engine that could work faster.
Chrome uses the Blink rendering engine to display web pages. Based on WebKit, Blink only uses WebKit's "WebCore" components while substituting all other components, such as its own multi-process architecture in place of WebKit's native implementation.
Chrome is internally tested with unit testing, "automated user interface testing of scripted user actions", fuzz testing, as well as WebKit's layout tests (99% of which Chrome is claimed to have passed), and against commonly accessed websites inside the Google index within 20–30 minutes.
Google created Gears for Chrome, which added features for web developers typically relating to the building of web applications, including offline support. However, Google phased out Gears in favor of HTML5.
On January 11, 2011 the Chrome product manager, Mike Jazayeri, announced that Chrome would remove H.264 video codec support for its HTML5 player, citing the desire to bring Google Chrome more in line with the currently available open codecs available in the Chromium project, which Chrome is based on. Despite this, on November 6, 2012, Google released a version of Chrome on Windows which added hardware-accelerated H.264 video decoding. In October 2013, Cisco announced that it was open sourcing its H.264 codecs and will cover all fees required.
On February 7, 2012, Google launched "Google Chrome Beta" for Android 4.0 devices. On many new devices with Android 4.1 and later preinstalled, Chrome is the default browser.
On April 3, 2013, Google announced that it would fork the WebCore component of WebKit to form its own layout engine known as Blink. The aim of Blink will be to give Chrome's developers more freedom in implementing its own changes to the engine, and to allow its codebase to be trimmed of code that is unnecessary or unimplemented by Chrome.
Enterprise deployment.
In December 2010 Google announced that to make it easier for businesses to use Chrome they would provide an official Chrome MSI package. For business use it is helpful to have full-fledged MSI packages that can be customized via transform files (.mst) - but the MSI provided with Chrome is only a very limited MSI wrapper fitted around the normal installer, and many businesses find that this arrangement does not meet their needs. The normal downloaded Chrome installer puts the browser in the user's local app data directory and provides invisible background updates, but the MSI package will allow installation at the system level, providing system administrators control over the update process — it was formerly possible only when Chrome was installed using Google Pack. Google also created group policy objects to fine tune the behavior of Chrome in the business environment, for example setting automatic updates interval, disable auto-updates, a home page and to workaround their basic Windows design flaws and bugs if it comes to roaming profiles support, etc. Until version 24 the software is known not to be ready for enterprise deployments with roaming profiles or Terminal Server/Citrix environments.
Chromium.
In September 2008, Google released a large portion of Chrome's source code as an open source project called Chromium. This move enabled third-party developers to study the underlying source code and to help port the browser to the OS X and Linux operating systems. The Google-authored portion of Chromium is released under the permissive BSD license. Other portions of the source code are subject to a variety of open source licenses. Chromium is similar to Chrome, but lacks built-in automatic updates, built-in PDF reader and built-in Flash player, as well as Google branding and has a blue-colored logo instead of the multicolored Google logo. Chromium does not implement user RLZ tracking.
Features.
Google Chrome aims to be secure, fast, simple and stable. There are extensive differences from its peers in Chrome's minimalistic user interface, which is atypical of modern web browsers. For example, Chrome does not render RSS feeds. One of Chrome's strengths is its application performance and JavaScript processing speed, both of which were independently verified by multiple websites to be the swiftest among the major browsers of its time. Many of Chrome's unique features had been previously announced by other browser developers, but Google was the first to implement and publicly release them. For example, a prominent graphical user interface (GUI) innovation, the merging of the address bar and search bar (the "Omnibox"), was first announced by Mozilla in May 2008 as a planned feature for Firefox. Both Internet Explorer 9 and Safari (version 6) have since merged the search and address bar.

Chrome allows users to synchronize their bookmarks, history, and settings across all devices with the browser installed by sending and receiving data through a chosen Google Account, which in turn updates all signed-in instances of Chrome.
This can be authenticated either through Google credentials, or a sync passphrase.
Web standards support.
The first release of Google Chrome passed both the Acid1 and Acid2 tests. Beginning with version 4.0, Chrome has passed all aspects of the Acid3 test.
Chrome currently has very good support for JavaScript/ECMAScript according to Ecma International's ECMAScript standards conformance Test 262 (version ES5.1 of 2012-05-18). This test reports as the final score the number of tests a browser failed; hence lower scores are better. In this test, Chrome version 28.0.1500.95 scored 10 failed/11573 passed. For comparison, Firefox 19 scored 193 failed/11752 passed and Internet Explorer 9 has a score of 600+ failed, while Internet Explorer 10 has a score of 7 failed.
On the official CSS 2.1 test suite by standardization organization W3C, WebKit, the Chrome rendering engine, passes 89.75% (89.38% out of 99.59% covered) CSS 2.1 tests.
On the HTML5 test, Chrome 32 on desktop scores 505 out of 555 points, which makes it the first place among desktop browsers. Chrome 32 for Android holds the first place among tablet browsers and the second place among mobile browsers, with 484 points.
Security.
Chrome periodically retrieves updates of two blacklists (one for phishing and one for malware), and warns users when they attempt to visit a site Chrome sees as potentially harmful. This service is also made available for use by others via a free public API called "Google Safe Browsing API".
Chrome uses a complex process-allocation model to allocate different tabs to fit into different processes to prevent what happens in one tab from affecting what happens in others. Following the principle of least privilege, each process is stripped of its rights and can compute, but cannot interact with sensitive areas (e.g. OS memory, user files) — this is similar to the "Protected Mode" used by Internet Explorer 9 and 10. The "Sandbox Team" is said to have "taken this existing process boundary and made it into a jail." This enforces a computer security model whereby there are two levels of multilevel security ("user" and "sandbox") and the "sandbox" can only respond to communication requests initiated by the "user". On Linux sandboxing uses the seccomp mode.
In December 2011 a report by Accuvant, funded by Google, rated the sandbox security of Google Chrome 12 and 13 as better than either Internet Explorer 9 or Mozilla Firefox 5.
Since 2008 Chrome has been faulted for not including a master password to prevent casual access to a user's passwords. Chrome developers have indicated that a master password does not provide real security against determined hackers and have refused to implement one. Bugs filed on this issue have been marked "WontFix".
Security vulnerabilities.
No security vulnerabilities in Chrome had been successfully exploited in the three years of Pwn2Own from 2009–2011.
However, Chrome was defeated at Pwn2Own 2012, by a French team who used zero day exploits in the version of Flash shipped with Chrome to take complete control of a fully patched 64-bit Windows 7 PC using a booby-trapped website that overcame Chrome's sandboxing.
Chrome was also compromised twice at the 2012 CanSecWest Pwnium. Google's official response to the exploits was delivered by Jason Kersey, who congratulated the researchers, noting "We also believe that both submissions are works of art and deserve wider sharing and recognition." Fixes for these vulnerabilities were deployed within 10 hours of the submission.
Version 23 fixed 15 security vulnerabilities of which six were rated as high priority.
Malware blocking.
Google introduced download scanning protection in Chrome 17. Chrome tries to prevent malware with Sandboxing. The Sandbox monitors each and every webpage tab separately. When the user opens a malicious website, Chrome contains the malware in an area called a sandbox. The other tabs that the user has open are unaffected. When the user closes the bad page, the malware goes with it leaving other tabs and the computer unaffected. Chrome also automatically updates to the latest security features to maximize user protection from malware.
Privacy.
Privacy mode.
The private browsing feature called "Incognito" mode prevents the browser from permanently storing any history information or cookies from the websites visited. Incognito mode is similar to the private browsing feature in other web browsers. Chrome was the second browser to implement this feature, after Safari.
User tracking.
Chrome sends details about its users to Google through both optional and non-optional user tracking mechanisms.
Some of the tracking mechanisms can be optionally enabled and disabled through the installation interface and through the browser's options dialog. Unofficial builds, such as SRWare Iron and CoolNovo (previously known as ChromePlus), seek to remove these features from the browser altogether. The RLZ feature is not included in the Chromium browser either.
In March 2010, Google devised a new method to collect installation statistics: the unique ID token included with Chrome is now only used for the first connection that Google Update makes to its server.
The optional suggestion service included in Google Chrome has been criticized because it provides the information typed into the Omnibox to the search provider before the user even hits return. This allows the search engine to provide URL suggestions, but also provides them with web usage information tied to an IP address.
The optional feature to use a web service to help resolve spelling errors has privacy implications.
Do Not Track.
In February 2012, Google announced that Chrome would support Do Not Track by the end of 2012 and the protocol was implemented on version 23.
Speed.
The JavaScript virtual machine used by Chrome, the V8 JavaScript engine, has features such as "dynamic code generation", "hidden class transitions", and "precise garbage collection".
Several websites performed benchmark tests using the SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark tool as well as Google's own set of computationally intense benchmarks, which include ray tracing and constraint solving. They unanimously reported that Chrome performed much faster than all competitors against which it had been tested, including Safari (for Windows), Firefox 3.0, Internet Explorer 7, Opera, and Internet Explorer 8. However on October 11, 2010 independent tests of JavaScript performance, Chrome has been scoring just behind Opera's Presto engine since it was updated in version 10.5.
On September 3, 2008, Mozilla responded by stating that their own TraceMonkey JavaScript engine (then in beta), was faster than Chrome's V8 engine in some tests. John Resig, Mozilla's JavaScript evangelist, further commented on the performance of different browsers on Google's own suite, commenting on Chrome's "decimating" of the other browsers, but he questioned whether Google's suite was representative of real programs. He stated that Firefox 3.0 performed poorly on recursion-intensive benchmarks, such as those of Google, because the Mozilla team had not implemented recursion-tracing yet.
Two weeks after Chrome's launch, the WebKit team announced a new JavaScript engine, SquirrelFish Extreme, citing a 36% speed improvement over Chrome's V8 engine.
Chrome uses DNS prefetching to speed up website lookups, as other browsers like Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer (called DNS Pre-resolution), and in Opera as a UserScript (not built-in).
Chrome utilizes the faster SPDY protocol instead of HTTP when communicating with servers that support it, such as Google services, Facebook, Twitter, and other websites.
Stability.
A multi-process architecture is implemented in Chrome where, by default, a separate process is allocated to each site instance and plugin. This procedure is termed process isolation, and it prevents tasks from interfering with each other, raising security and stability. An attacker successfully gaining access to one application gains access to no others, and failure in one instance results in a "Sad Tab" screen of death, similar to the well-known "Sad Mac", but only one tab crashes instead of the whole application. This strategy exacts a fixed per-process cost up front, but results in less memory bloat overall as fragmentation is confined to each instance and no longer needs further memory allocations. This architecture is being adopted in upcoming versions of Safari and Firefox.
Chrome includes a process management utility called "Task Manager" which lets users see what sites and plugins are using the most memory, downloading the most bytes and overusing the CPU and provides the ability to terminate them. Chrome Version 23 ensures its users an improved battery life for the systems supporting Chrome's GPU accelerated video decoding.
User interface.
By default, the main user interface includes back, forward, refresh/cancel and menu buttons. A home button is not shown by default, but can be added through the Settings page to take the user to the new tab page or a custom home page.
Tabs are the main component of Chrome's user interface and as such, have been moved to the top of the window rather than below the controls. This subtle change contrasts with many existing tabbed browsers which are based on windows and contain tabs. Tabs, with their state, can be transferred seamlessly between window containers by dragging. Each tab has its own set of controls, including the "Omnibox".
The "Omnibox" is a URL box that combines the functions of both the address bar and search box. If a user enters the URL of a site previously searched from, Chrome allows pressing "Tab" to search the site again directly from the Omnibox. When a user starts typing in the Omnibox, Chrome provides suggestions for previously visited sites (based on the URL or in-page text), popular websites (not necessarily visited before — powered by Google Instant), and popular searches. Although Instant can be turned off, suggestions based on previously visited sites cannot be turned off. Chrome will also autocomplete the URLs of sites visited often. If a user types keywords into the Omnibox that don't match any previously visited websites and presses enter, Chrome will conduct the search using the default search engine.
One of Chrome's differentiating features is the "New Tab Page", which can replace the browser home page and is displayed when a new tab is created. Originally, this showed thumbnails of the nine most visited web sites, along with frequent searches, recent bookmarks, and recently closed tabs; similar to Internet Explorer and Firefox with Google Toolbar, or Opera's Speed Dial. In Google Chrome 2.0, the New Tab Page was updated to allow users to hide thumbnails they did not want to appear.
Starting in version 3.0, the New Tab Page was revamped to display thumbnails of the eight most visited web sites. The thumbnails could be rearranged, pinned, and removed. Alternatively, a list of text links could be displayed instead of thumbnails. It also features a "Recently closed" bar that shows recently closed tabs and a "tips" section that displays hints and tricks for using the browser.
Chrome includes a "bookmarks" submenu that lists the user's bookmarks, provides easy access to Chrome's "Bookmark Manager," and allows the user to toggle a "bookmarks bar" on or off.
For web developers, Chrome features an element inspector (Inspect Element), similar to the browser extension in Firebug, which allows users to look into the DOM and see what makes up the webpage.
Chrome has special URLs that load application-specific pages instead of websites or files on disk. Chrome also has a built-in ability to enable experimental features. Originally called codice_1, the address was changed to codice_2 to make it less obvious to casual users.
In March 2011, Google introduced a new simplified logo to replace the previous 3D logo that had been used since the project's inception. Google designer Steve Rura explained the company reasoning for the change: "Since Chrome is all about making your web experience as easy and clutter-free as possible, we refreshed the Chrome icon to better represent these sentiments. A simpler icon embodies the Chrome spirit – to make the web quicker, lighter, and easier for all."
In September, 2013, Google started making Chrome apps "For your desktop." This meant offline access, desktop shortcuts, and less dependence on Chrome- They launch in a window separate from Chrome, and look more like native applications.
Desktop shortcuts and apps.
Chrome allows users to make local desktop shortcuts that open web applications in the browser. The browser, when opened in this way, contains none of the regular interface except for the title bar, so as not to "interrupt anything the user is trying to do". This allows web applications to run alongside local software (similar to Mozilla Prism and Fluid).
This feature, according to Google, will be enhanced with the Chrome Web Store, a one-stop web-based web applications directory which opened in December 2010.
Chrome Web Store.
Announced on December 7, 2010, the Chrome Web Store allows users to install web applications as extensions to the browser, although most of these function simply as links to popular web pages and/or games, but some of the apps like Springpad do provide extra features like offline access. The themes and extensions have also been tightly integrated into the new store, allowing users to search the entire catalog of Chrome extras.
The Chrome Web Store was opened on February 11, 2011 with the release of Google Chrome 9.0.
Extensions.
On September 9, 2009, Google enabled extensions by default on Chrome's Dev channel, and provided several sample extensions for testing. In December, the Google Chrome extension gallery beta began with over 300 extensions.
Along with Google Chrome 4.0, the extension gallery was officially launched on January 25, 2010, containing over 1500 extensions.
As of February 4, 2011, the extension gallery featured more than 11,500 extensions, including official extensions from the Independent, CEOP, Transport for London, Cricinfo, and FIFA.
Many Chrome extensions, once installed, have access to the user's data. There are three levels of permissions that an app or extension may request.
Themes.
Starting with Google Chrome 3.0, users can install themes to alter the appearance of the browser. Many free third-party themes are provided in an online gallery, accessible through a "Get themes" button in Chrome's options.
Automatic web page translation.
Starting with Google Chrome 4.1 the application added a built-in translation bar using Google Translate. Translation is currently available for 52 languages. When Chrome detects a foreign language other than the user's preferred language as set during the installation time, it asks the user whether or not to translate. It is optional for usage, and not that Chrome will translate the text upon detection.
Release channels and updates.
On January 8, 2009, Google introduced a new release system with three distinct channels: Stable, Beta, and Developer preview (called the "Dev" channel). Before this change there were only two channels: Beta and Developer preview. All previous Developer channel users were moved to the Beta channel. The reason given by Google is that the Developer channel builds are less stable and polished than those that Developer channel users were getting during Google Chrome's Beta period. The stable channel will be updated with features and fixes once they have been thoroughly tested in the Beta channel, and the Beta channel will be updated roughly monthly with stable and complete features from the Developer channel.
The Developer channel is where ideas get tested (and sometimes fail) and can be very unstable at times. On July 22, 2010, Google announced it will ramp up the speed it will release new stable versions; they will shorten the release cycles from quarterly to 6 weeks. The faster release cycle brought a fourth channel: the "Canary" release; the name refers to using canaries in coal mines, so if a change "kills" Chrome Canary, they will block it from the developer build. Canary will be "the most bleeding-edge official version of Chrome and somewhat of a mix between Chrome dev and the Chromium snapshot builds". Canary releases run side-by-side with any other channel; it is not linked to the other Google Chrome installation and can therefore run different synchronization profiles, themes, and browser preferences. It does not natively include the option to be the default browser, although on OS X it can be set through Safari's preferences. Canary was Windows-only at first; an OS X version was released on May 3, 2011.
Chrome beta for Android was launched on January 10, 2013; like Canary, it runs side-by-side with the stable channel for Android.
Chrome automatically keeps itself up-to-date. The details differ by platform.
On Windows, it uses Google Update, and auto-update can be controlled via Group Policy. Alternatively, users may download one of two standalone installers of a version of Chrome that does not auto-update. On OS X, it uses Google Update Service, and auto-update can be controlled via the OS X "defaults" system. On Linux, it lets the system's normal package management system supply the updates.
Color management.
Chrome supports color management by using the system provided ICC v2 and v4 support on OS X, and from version 22 supports ICC v2 profiles by default on other platforms.
Platforms.
Below is a list of platforms for which Chrome is available.
Android version.
A beta version for Android 4.0 devices was launched on February 7, 2012, available for a limited number of countries from Google Play.
Notable features: synchronization with desktop Chrome to provide the same bookmarks and view the same browser tabs, page pre-rendering, hardware acceleration.
Many of the latest HTML5 features: almost all of the Web Platform’s features: GPU-accelerated canvas, including CSS 3D Transforms, CSS animations, SVG, WebSocket (including binary messages), Dedicated Workers; it has overflow scroll support, strong HTML5 video support, and new capabilities such as IndexedDB, WebWorkers, Application Cache and the File APIs, date and time pickers, parts of the Media Capture API. Also supports mobile oriented features such as Device Orientation and Geolocation.
Mobile customisations: swipe gesture tab switching, link preview allows zooming in on (multiple) links to ensure the desired one is clicked, font size boosting to ensure readability regardless of the zoom level.
Missing in the mobile version are sandboxed tabs, Safe Browsing, apps or extensions, Adobe Flash (now and in future), Native Client.
Development changes: remote debugging, part of the browser layer has been implemented in Java, communicating with the rest of the Chromium and WebKit code through Java Native Bindings. The code of Chrome for Android is a fork of the Chromium project. It is a priority to upstream most new and modified code to Chromium and WebKit to resolve the fork.
The April 17, 2012 update included the availability to access in 31 additional languages and in all countries where Google Play is available. A desktop version of a website can also be requested as opposed to a mobile version. In addition, Android users can now add bookmarks to their Android home screens if they choose and decide which apps should handle links opened in Chrome.
On the June 27, 2012 Google Chrome for Android exited beta and became stable.
Chrome 18.0.1026311, released at September 26, 2012 was the first version of Chrome for Android to support Intel x86 based mobile devices.
Starting from version 25, the Chrome version for Android is aligned with the desktop version, and usually new stable releases are available at the same time between the Android and the desktop version. Google released a separate Chrome for Android beta channel on January 10, 2013, with version 25. Currently, a separate beta version of Chrome is available in the Google Play store and it can run side-by-side with the stable release.
Chrome OS.
Google Chrome is the basis of Google's Chrome OS operating system that ships on specific hardware from Google's manufacturing partners. The user interface has a minimalist design resembling the Google Chrome browser. Chrome OS is aimed at users who spend most of their computer time on the Web; the only applications on the devices are a browser incorporating a media player and a file manager.
Google announced Chrome OS on July 7, 2009.
iOS version.
Chrome is available on Apple's mobile iOS operating system as "Google Chrome for iOS." Released in the Apple App Store on June 26, 2012, it supports the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch, and requires that the device have iOS version 6.0 or greater installed. Per Apple's requirements for browsers released through their App Store, this version of Chrome uses the "iOS WebKit" - which is Apple's own mobile rendering engine and components, developed for their "Safari" browser - but is restricted from using their Nitro JavaScript engine. Chrome is the default web browser for the iOS "Gmail" application, but it cannot be used as the device-wide default application for opening webpages because Apple has not provided iOS users with the option to change the default from Safari.
In a review by Chitika, Chrome was noted as having 1.5% of the iOS web browser market as of July 18, 2012.
Windows 8 version.
In June 2012, "Windows 8 mode" was introduced to Dev channel, which enables Windows 8 users to run Chrome in a full-screen, tablet-optimized interface within the Metro shell, with access to snapping, sharing, and search functionalities. In October 2013, Windows 8 mode on Dev channel changed to use a desktop environment mimicking the interface of Chrome OS with a dedicated windowing system and taskbar for web apps.
Usage.
In 2008, Matthew Moore in the "The Daily Telegraph" summarized the verdict of early reviewers: "Google Chrome is attractive, fast and has some impressive new features, but may not — yet — be a threat to its Microsoft rival."
Initially, Microsoft reportedly played down the threat from Chrome and predicted that most people would embrace Internet Explorer 8. Opera Software said that "Chrome will strengthen the Web as the biggest application platform in the world". But by February 25, 2010, "BusinessWeek" had reported that "For the first time in years, energy and resources are being poured into browsers, the ubiquitous programs for accessing content on the Web. Credit for this trend—a boon to consumers—goes to two parties. The first is Google, whose big plans for the Chrome browser have shaken Microsoft out of its competitive torpor and forced the software giant to pay fresh attention to its own browser, Internet Explorer. Microsoft all but ceased efforts to enhance IE after it triumphed in the last browser war, sending Netscape to its doom. Now it's back in gear." Mozilla said that Chrome's introduction into the web browser market comes as "no real surprise", that "Chrome is not aimed at competing with Firefox", and furthermore that it would not affect Google's revenue relationship with Mozilla.
Chrome overtook Firefox in November 2011 in worldwide usage. , according to StatCounter, Google Chrome had 34% worldwide usage share, making it the most widely used web browser, while Internet Explorer had 33% and Firefox had 22%.
Along with Safari and Mozilla Firefox, Chrome receives a weekend "bump", which boosts its marketshare by as much as three percentage points on week-ends, at the expense of Internet Explorer.
It was reported by StatCounter, a web analytics company, that for the single day of Sunday, March 18, 2012 Chrome was the most used web browser in the world for the first time. Chrome secured 32.7% of the global web browsing on that day, while Internet Explorer followed closely behind with 32.5%.
From May 14–21, 2012 Google Chrome was responsible for more Internet traffic than Microsoft's Internet Explorer (for the first time), which long had held its spot as the most used web browser in the world. According to StatCounter, 31.88% of web traffic was generated by Chrome for a sustained period of one week and 31.47% by Internet Explorer. Though Chrome has topped Internet Explorer for single day's usage in the past, this is the first time it has led for one full week.
At the 2012 Google I/O developers' conference, Google claimed that there were 310 million active users of Chrome, almost double the number in 2011, which was stated as 160 million active users.
As of June 2013, according to StatCounter, Chrome overtook Internet Explorer for the first time in the US.
As of August 2013, Chrome was used by 43% of internet users worldwide. This study was done by Statista, which also noted that in North America, only 34% of people use Chrome, the lowest in the world.
Developing for Chrome.
It is possible to develop Apps, Extensions, and Themes for Chrome. They contain a manifest file that specifies basic information (such as version, name, description, privileges, etc.), and other files for UI (icons, popups, etc.). Google even has an official developer's guide.

PocketDisc

Pocket Disc were a type of flexidisc, made by Americom Coperation and experimented with in the late 1960s by 28 major record labels, (but some major labels such as Columbia Records, RCA Records, Motown Records, and MCA Records chose not to participate) and included popular artists of the era such as The Beatles, Aretha Franklin, The Beach Boys, Steppenwolf and Jimi Hendrix, that were small enough (four inches in diameter) to be carried in one's pocket or shipped in an envelope and not be as fragile as a standard record, but could still be played on the standard manual-only phonograph or record player (at 33 RPM). 
Philco manufactured these types of disks under the name "Hip Pocket Records" and sold them to be played on portable record players, which were specially created for the disks. Artists who appeared on these disks included Neil Diamond, The Five Americans, The Doors, Sonny and Cher, Merrilee Rush, and Joan Baez. The disks were sold in vending machines for 50 cents or counter displays at stores for 49 cents and could hold a capacity of about 3.5 minutes of music. Due to this reason songs like The Beatles' Hey Jude, which was 7 minutes long, could not be played in their entirety Pricing was later dropped to 39 cents.
They were first officially released on September 15, 1968 and test marketed in several major cities in the United States, but did not catch on or become a standard music format like their creators and marketers had hoped. They were discontinued in 1969.

<doc id="19133431" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19133431" title="Duvvuri Subbarao">
Duvvuri Subbarao

Duvvuri Subbarao (దువ్వూరి సుబ్బారావు), born on 11 August 1949, is an Indian economist, central banker, and civil servant. He was the 22nd Governor of Reserve Bank of India, served under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 
Subbarao is a 1972 batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer of Andhra Pradesh cadre. On 5 September 2008, he was appointed the twenty-second Governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI); his term was to end in September 2011. But breaking from tradition, the Prime Minister's Office extended his term by two years until 4 September 2013.
Early life.
Subbarao's hometown is Eluru in West Godavari district, a city near Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. He did his schooling from the Sainik School in Korukonda, Andhra Pradesh. He graduated in Physics B.Sc Hons. from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (class of 1969) where he was the recipient of Director's Gold Medal.
He received a M.Sc degree also in Physics from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. Subbarao topped the Civil Services Examination in 1972 and was assigned the Andhra Pradesh cadre.
In 1978, he did a Masters degree in economics from Ohio State University, United States. After a few years, Subbarao joined the Humphrey Fellowship program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study Quantitative Economic Modelling. He became a Humphrey Fellow at MIT in 1982. He later received a Ph.D. in Economics from Andhra University. His doctoral thesis was titled "Fiscal reforms at the sub-national level" (1998).
Career.
Dr.Subbarao worked as the joint secretary in the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India between 1988 and 1993. Subsequently he became the Finance Secretary to the Government of Andhra Pradesh between 1993 and 1998. On completion of his term, he was deputed as lead economist in the World Bank from 1994 to 2004. On completion of his term, he was appointed to the Prime Ministers’ Economic Advisory Council from 2005 to 2007 before he was elevated as the Finance Secretary in 2007.On 5 September 2008, he was appointed the twenty-second Governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Arun Ramanathan was appointed as Finance Secretary on 21 September 2008 in his vacancy. His term was extended for two more years in 2011.
Dr.Subbarao was involved in the initiation of fiscal reforms at the state level and had managed a flagship study on decentralisation across major countries of East Asia including China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines and Cambodia.He is credited with financial turnaround of Andhra Pradesh in late nineties when the state had slipped into an unprecedented fiscal crisis
Achievements.
During his tenure as Governor of RBI, Dr Subbarao took initiatives for demystification of the Central Bank, including lucid presentation of terse macro economic concepts in the RBI publications and grassroots level interaction with the masses through various financial inclusion, financial literacy and village outreach programmes. He was instrumental in ensuring 100% meaningful financial inclusion in Ernakulam district of Kerala. In February 2012, Subbarao expounded his world famous theory on the New Trilemma of Central Bankers, which he named as the "Holy Trinity" of "price stability", "financial stability" and "sovereign debt sustainability" as against Mundell's well known "Impossible Trinity" of "fixed exchange rate", "free capital flows" and "independent monetary policy". Subbarao's erudite exposition on "holy trinity" firmly established the Indian perspective in the scholastic debate on the global central banking trilemma.
Dr Subbarao's taking charge as RBI Governor in 2008 was coincident with the outbreak of the Global Financial Crisis. Subbarao is generally credited as having safely stewarded Indian economy through the financial crisis. However, it was during Subbarao's tenure that the value of Indian Rupee tumbled spectacularly, with USD/INR exchange rate for the first time breaching the psychological barrier of 60, and even hitting a new low of 69.
Controversies.
Dr Subbarao is known to have a mind of his own and frequently vetoes / overrides the opinion of his fellow members in the Technical Advisory Group on Monetary Policy. He is criticized as lacking "democratic spirit" by regularly going against majority opinion of fellow experts in the apex level committee.
During Subbarao's last days at the helm of RBI, the banking industry in India was rocked by the infamous CobraPost exposé of money laundering by leading Indian banks through violation of RBI's KYC guidelines, which pointed to the slackness and loopholes in the supervisory role of RBI. Dr Subbarao was also drawn into controversy when a whistleblowing complaint written to him in October 2012 by the noted activist Devidas Tuljapurkar against fraudulent activities of Bank of Maharashtra, was routinely and unthinkingly forwarded by the RBI Governor to the very organisation against which the complaint had been made. This led to alleged harassment of Tuljapurkar (an ex-Director of Bank of Maharashtra) by the bank management, undermining the abject failure of whistle-blowing policy in both RBI and BoM.
Personal life.
He is married to Urmila Subbarao. They have two sons, Mallik and Raghav. Mallik, a graduate from IIT Kanpur works at the World Bank while Raghav, a graduate from IIT Delhi works in London.

USS Watchman (AGR-16)

USS "Watchman" (AGR-16/YAGR-16) was a "Guardian"-class radar picket ship acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1958 from the "mothballed" reserve fleet. She was reconfigured as a radar picket ship and assigned to radar picket duty in the North Pacific Ocean as part of the Distant Early Warning Line.
Liberty ship built in Florida.
"SS Vernon S. Hood" was laid down under a U.S. Maritime Commission contract (MCE hull 2343) on 17 January 1945 at the Wainwright yard of the J. S. Jones Construction Co. in Panama City, Florida; launched on 20 February 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Inez Bulifant; and delivered to the Maritime Commission on 7 March 1945.
World War II-related service.
Following a shakedown cruise in the Gulf of Mexico, the freighter was turned over to the Overtakes Freight Corporation to be operated by that firm under a contract with the Maritime Commission. During her brief period of active operations with the Maritime Commission, 1945 to 1947, she also served under contract with the Moore-McCormack Lines. Later that year, she was placed out of service and was berthed with the National Defense Reserve Fleet at James River, Virginia.
Reconfigured as a radar picket.
The ship remained there until mid-1958 when she was taken over by the Navy and converted to a radar picket ship at the Charleston Naval Shipyard (South Carolina). During conversion, she was renamed "Watchman" and received the designation "YAGR-16". However, that designation was changed to "AGR-16" before she completed her conversion late in the year. On 5 January 1958, "Watchman" was placed in commission at Charleston, Lt. Comdr. Irvin Boaz in command.
"Watchman" conducted shakedown training in the Guantanamo Bay operating area during February. Following post-shakedown availability at Charleston from 5 to 18 March, she completed repairs and got underway for the U.S. West Coast. After transiting the Panama Canal and visiting Acapulco, Mexico, she arrived in her new home port --San Francisco, California -- on 11 April. 
Assigned to the Continental Air Defense Command, she served as one of several radar picket ships operating as seaborne extensions of the command's contiguous radar coverage system. She operated from her base at San Francisco during her entire naval career, spending an average of 200 days per year actually at sea engaged in picket patrols. 
That routine continued until 1 September 1965, at which time she and the remaining "AGR's" were placed out of commission.
Deactivation.
Her name was struck from the Navy List that same day, and she was returned to the Maritime Administration for lay up with the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California. She remained there until 3 October 1974 when she was sold to American Ship Dismantlers for scrapping.
Honors and awards.
"Watchman" personnel qualified for the following medal:

Alexandre Bultos

Alexandre Bultos (18 June 1749, Brussels - 20 September 1787) was a Belgian comic actor and theatre director.
Life.
The seventh child of Pierre-François Bultos and his wife Marie-Josèphe Lambert, wine merchants and hotelliers, Alexandre made his stage debut in December 1761 aged 12, in "La Servante maîtresse" by Pierre Baurans, after the work by Pergolesi, beside his close contemporary Angélique D'Hannetaire (like him, a student of Ignaz Vitzthumb, music-master of the Théâtre de la Monnaie). When this play was reprised two month later, François-Antoine de Chevrier wrote:
From 1767 to 1770 he was part of the Ghent troupe, acted at Strasbourg in 1770, and then acted at Maastricht in Charles Bernardy's troupe, before finally getting to Copenhagen under his own steam. Taken on at Brussels in 1772 as an ensemble member then as Laruette and his comic leads from 1773, he divided his duties with Dazincourt, which sometimes led to tension between Dazincourt and Bultos. Dazincourt left Brussels for Paris in 1776, leaving Bultos alone to fill the lead roles. In 1777 Bultos and his father obtained permission to open a vauxhall in the Parc de Bruxelles and the same year Alexandre became co-director of the Théâtre de la Monnaie alongside Louis-Jean Pin. Five years later, he made his brother Herman (1752-1801) his co-director. Around 1785 he tried to make a debut at the Comédie-Française but was dissuaded by his contemporaries.

Rezovo

Rezovo (, pronounced ) is a village and seaside resort in southeastern Bulgaria, part of Tsarevo Municipality, Burgas Province, in the coastal Strandzha geographical region. Lying at the mouth of the Rezovo River in the Black Sea, Rezovo is the southernmost point of the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast and the southeastern-most inhabited place in Bulgaria and the European Union mainland. The village is located 11 kilometres south of Sinemorets, 17 km from Ahtopol and 36 km from Lozenets. As the Rezovo River constitutes the border between Bulgaria and the European part of Turkey, Rezovo directly overlooks the Turkish bank of the river and the Turkish village of Beğendik, in Demirköy district, Kırklareli Province.
History.
Researchers have attempted to link the village's name to that of Rhesus of Thrace, a Thracian king of the "Iliad", and although the existence of an ancient settlement at the place of the modern village has been proven (with the oldest artifacts dating to the 4th century BC), it is hard to establish any connection with Rhesus' personality. In ancient times, the area was subject to large-scale metallurgical activity, with the largest ancient deposit of slag in Bulgaria. It is believed that the medieval fortress of "Castrition" lay on Cape Kastrich north of modern Rezovo.
Today's village was first mentioned in Ottoman registers as "Rezvi", a village of 41 Christian families. In the 18th century, it was noted as "Büyük Rezve" ("Big Rezve") and marked as a sea port on Ottoman maps. According to Austrian Wenzel von Bronjar and other 18th-century western travellers, the river mouth at that place had a good wharf suitable as a storm and winter shelter. Rezovo has changed its location slightly several times: its oldest known location is the same as today's, at the coast. However, the locals were forced to move inland because of persistent raids by Caucasian Laz pirates, settling during the 19th century in the "Kladarsko Bardo" area 10 kilometres to the west, also along the Rezovo River. By 1900, that "Old Rezovo" had 70–80 houses and an Eastern Orthodox church of Saint Elijah the Forerunner. The seaside land was not completely abandoned, as it was used as a pasture because of the favourable climate.
In 1903, the residents of Rezovo took an active part in the Bulgarian Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising, seeking unification with their compatriots in the Principality of Bulgaria. However, the revolt was crushed by the Ottoman authorities and most of Old Rezovo was burned to the ground. The surviving locals settled on the coast, approximately where the oldest known incarnation of the village had been. The Church of Saints Constantine and Helena was built in 1906. After the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, Rezovo became part of the Kingdom of Bulgaria and a limited number of Bulgarian refugees (25 families) from other parts of Eastern Thrace that remained under Ottoman rule settled in the village. According to Lyubomir Miletich's demographic survey of the Ottoman province of Edirne in "The Destruction of Thracian Bulgarians in 1913", published in 1918, before the wars Rezovo (Рѣзово) was a village in the district of Vassiliko inhabited by 70 Bulgarian Exarchist families.
After the wars, the main occupation of the locals was charcoal production and logging, with some agriculture, cattle breeding and fishing. Wood and charcoal were exported by means of the wooden pier in the Rezovo River. The population has gradually declined, however, but today Rezovo is a popular beach resort and a spot frequented by tourists because of its southeasternmost location. Until recently, it was part of the border zone and visitors were required to be checked by Border Police officials. As Bulgaria joined the European Union on 1 January 2007, Rezovo became the contiguous EU's southeasternmost point. On 2 January 2007, municipal mayor Petko Arnaudov hoisted the flag of Europe in the village, along with the national and municipal flags, and the street starting from the Bulgarian border sign was renamed the Europe Alley.
In January 2011 a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak was registered in the village of Rezovo.
Rezovski Creek on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Rezovo.

Maria Orsola Bussone

Maria Orsola Bussone was a young woman from Vallo Torinese, Piedmont, Italy, who was declared a Servant of God in December 2000.
Life.
Maria Orsola Bussone came from a family of blue collar workers. Her father owned a car repair office and her mother was a basic tailor (a "sarta"). Since her childhood she attended with great participation to the activities in her parish and could be present to several meetings of young Italian people in the Gen Movement, the young's section of Focolare Movement. The spirituality of that movement impressed very much the young girl, that in a letter sent to Chiara Lubich, the founder of the "focolarini", said that she wanted to inspire all her life to the unconditional love towards other people, letting "God use me as He wants... because that's the only thing that's worth in our life...". 
In July 1970 Maria Orsola, who liked to play guitar and to sing with other young people
of her parish, went to a trip near to Venice, as an animator in the parish school-camp located at Ca' Savio. 
During this stay a trivial incident (She died of an electrical discharge while she dried hair with a defective hair-dryer) provoked her death when she was only 15 years old. This happened precisely in the area of Cavallino-Treporti.
On 26 May 1996 Cardinal Giovanni Saldarini (Turin's archbishop), opened a diocesan inquiry in order to begin a beatification process, that closed with a positive ending on 17 December 2000.

Tea (poem)

"Tea" is a poem from Wallace Stevens's first book of poetry,
"Harmonium." It was first
published in 1915 in the journal "Rogue", so it is in the public domain.
Eleanor Cook observes that "Tea" is one of two "seemingly (but far from) slight poems that close both editions of "Harmonium"," adding that this "eight-line, one-sentence, free-verse virtuoso performance" offers a very effective implicit leave-taking. (The other poem she is referring to is "To the Roaring Wind", quoted at the bottom of the main "Harmonium" essay.)
Cook compares "Tea" to Domination of Black, as being representative of "all the troping of leaves through the collection". She suggests that the reference to Java may be significant not only because it was a center of tea-trade, but also because its sophisticated court culture at one time, notable for its subtleties and appreciation of artists, "made it the kind of culture that Stevens especially liked". She also suggests that the poem expresses "Stevens's delicately implicit trope of drinking tea as a metaphor for reading (ingesting a drink from leaves)." She notes that Stevens was a tea-fancier.
Robert Buttel characterizes this poem as light, witty, and rococo, and as displaying compression, concentration, and precision. "The last four lines set the world of civilized order against the outdoor coldness," he writes, "ending on a note of exotic beauty, color, and elegance..." He suggests that the experience or feeling of being civilized is presented symbolically in "Tea". It is one of the two earliest Stevens poems to combine wit and elegance, according to Buttel, the other being "Cy est Pourtraicte, Madame Ste Ursule, et les Unze Mille Vierges", also published in 1915. The two poems are proofs that by 1915 Stevens had mastered the tools in the workshop of nineteenth-century poetry that he had set himself to learn, including imagism, impressionism, and symbolism.
As mentioned in the main "Harmonium" essay (see the section "The Mind of China"), the poem shows the influence of orientalism on Stevens's work.

Plot.
The plot centers around the murder of the curator of the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. The police call in Professor Langford Fife (a pastiche of both Robert Langdon from the book and Barney Fife from The Andy Griffith Show), a professor of symbology at a local community college, to help them solve the mystery. As the curator was dying, he put on a pair of rubber overalls. He held a lemon in one hand and a can of Chicken of the Sea in the other. He called the police as he was dying and told them that Mr. Fife could decode the message.
Mr. Fife meets Sopha Poisson during the course of his investigation. She informs him that the murdered curator was her grandfather. Together they work to decode a series of messages hidden in the paintings of Norman Rockwell, leading to a shocking discovery: Sopha is a mermaid. The movie ends with Mr. Fife taking her to the sea.

Dwight Stansel (born July 6, 1947) is a Florida politician of the Democratic Party and a former member of the Florida House of Representatives from District 11.
Early life and education.
Dwight Stansel was born in Lake City, Columbia County, Florida to Bobby E. and Maudell J. Stansel, both of whom came from farming families. He grew up on the family farm in Wellborn, and graduated from Suwannee High School in 1964. Stansel was raised Southern Baptist, and is a member of Mt. Beulah Baptist Church, in Wellborn, Florida.
Career.
Early career, and career outside politics.
After high school, Stansel joined the Florida National Guard, where he served for 10 years. Prior to purchasing the family farm and taking over the operations in 1986, Dwight was an airport manager at the Suwannee County airport. His father had already decided that the farm would be divided up amongst the four children and they could do as they pleased with their share of the land. Dwight's siblings, however, really had no interest in farming, and conceded their share of the land, allowing Dwight to take majority ownership, keep the farm going, and ensure that the land would remain with the family. Thus it became the Dwight Stansel Farm and Nursery. After taking over the operation of the farm that was started in the 1880s in Wellborn, by his grandparents, John Vincent Stansel, and Kate Geneva (Stevens) Stansel, Dwight grew the farm into a very profitable business growing pine trees, tobacco, and peanuts, and raising chickens. Since 1986, the farm has more than doubled in size, and now covers several hundred acres of land. Today, Dwight is still general manager, mostly overseeing the tree farm. He stopped growing tobacco, son Erwin manages the peanut farm, and Erwin's wife, Glenda manages the poultry farm.
House of Representatives (1998-2006).
Dwight Stansel was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, District 11 seat in 1998.
When he took office in 1998, his District included the following counties: Columbia County, Hamilton County, Lafayette County, Madison County, Suwannee County and parts of Dixie County and Gilchrist County. In 2003, the area his district covered was then changed to include the following counties: Gilchrist County, Lafayette County, Suwannee County and parts of Alachua County, Columbia County, and Dixie County. Today, the district still represents the same general area, excluding Dixie County.
While in Legislature, Stansel became Vice Chairman of the State Agriculture Committee. He also served on the Agriculture and Environment Appropriations Committee, The Select Committee to Protect Private Property Rights, The State Infrastructure Council, State Resources Council, and The Transportation Committee.
While in office, Stansel sponsored seven bills. All but two of them died. The University of Florida Men's Basketball Team Bill (HR 9089) that Stansel sponsored passed unanimously, and state of Florida honored the 2006 UF Men's Basketball Team for winning the championship. He co-sponsored several other bills which includes the Affordable Housing Bill (HB 1363), and the Land Acquisition Management Bill (HB 1347). Being a farmer, and avid hunter, Stansel sponsored many land ownership and property rights bills as well as gun laws, and hunting regulations bills.
Stansel is also known for cracking the whip during the Florida House's annual "Boot Day", and explaining how it was used much more commonly in the early days of Florida, for cattle drives- which is where the term "cracker", or "Florida Cracker" came from.

Muhammad I Abu 'l-Abbas

Muhammad I Abu 'l-Abbas (died 856) was the fifth emir of the Aghlabids in Ifriqiya (ruled 841–856).
Muhammad I was the son of the fourth emir, Abu Iqal (838–841). Under him the Aghlabids continued their expansion into the Mediterranean, conquering Taranto and Bari (841) in Apulia and Messina in Sicily (843). In 846 an Aghlabid force seized Rome and plundered the Vatican, though they were not able to hold onto Rome and Taranto and Bari soon detached themselves from the Aghlabids and submitted to the Abbasids in Baghdad.
In Ifriqiya agriculture and trade flourished and there was new urban construction, notably of the great mosques of Sousse und Sfax. Muhammad's reign was briefly interrupted by the usurpation of his brother Abu Ja'far Ahmad, who like his Abbasid contemporary Al-Wathiq supported the Mu'tazili and persecuted their Sunni opponents, executing some and imprisoning others, like the Maliki jurist Sahnun; when Muhammad I regained the throne in 847, he sent his brother into exile and rehabilitated the Sunnis, making Sahnun chief qadi of Ifriqiya.
Muhammad I was succeeded by his son Ahmad ibn Muhammad (856–863).

Cocodrie is an unincorporated fishing, shrimping and crabbing village in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, ten miles south of Chauvin and due south of the city of Houma. It is part of the Houma–Bayou Cane–Thibodaux Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Acadian settlement is known for being very near the landfall location for Tropical Storm Matthew on October 10, 2004, and Hurricane Gustav on September 1, 2008.
The name "Cocodrie" derives from a Louisiana Creole French term for alligator. It is a waterfront town, located due west of Grand Isle, on an inlet of another bay blocked by several barrier islands along the Gulf of Mexico. 
Cocodrie is connected to Houma, due north, by Louisiana state highway 56. It is at the end of the highway. All buildings in Cocodrie are now elevated on pilings to minimize flood damage.
Cocodrie is home to the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) W. J. DeFelice Marine Center, which was completed in 1986.[http://www.lumcon.edu/facilities/marinecenter/]
Impact from Hurricane Gustav.
On September 1, 2008, Hurricane Gustav, coming from Cuba, made a technical landfall near Cocodrie, around 9:30 a.m. CDT. When Hurricane Gustav came from the southeast, the hurricane force winds (up to 115 mph, 180 km/h) extended for 70 miles from the eye center, impacting the area with north-to-south winds for over five hours before making landfall.

Cocodrie is mentioned in the Swamp Thing comic books.
Cocodrie, Louisiana was featured in the Insomniac Games PlayStation 3 game Resistance 2 between the Holar Tower and Chicxulub Crater levels. The level consists of a plantation style environment surrounded by swamp and marshlands and includes a large bridge later on into the level which highly resembles a single span of the Crescent City Connection which is located in New Orleans, approximately 85 miles northeast of Cocodrie.

Vauxhall, Brussels

The Vauxhall (), otherwise known as the Waux-Hall, is a historic building in "Parc de Bruxelles" in Brussels, Belgium. It is named after the pleasure gardens of Vauxhall in London, which only became known to the inhabitants of Brussels in 1761, when a ballet entitled "Le Phaxal" was put on at the "Théâtre de la Monnaie". In Paris, the stage-builder Torré opened a "garden of amusements" in 1764, which the public came to call the "Vaux-Hall de Torré". A "Vaux-Hall d'hiver" (a winter Vauxhall) was set up in 1769 at the "foire Saint-Germin".
The history of the ""Vauxhall de Bruxelles"" is intimately linked to that of the "Théâtre Royal du Parc". It was opened in 1781 by Alexandre Bultos and his brother Herman Bultos (co-directors of the "Théâtres de la Monnaie" and of the Parc). It was initially a drinking palace, concert hall and theatre. Since 1818, it is the property of the City of Brussels. It has been used by the arts and literature club Cercle Gaulois and its predecessors as a venue for meetings, dinners, exhibitions and concerts.

Sara Whalen

Sara Whalen Hess (born April 28, 1976), née Whalen, is an American retired professional soccer player. Whalen played for the United States Women's National Soccer Team from 1997 to 2000, and was a founding player of WUSA. 
Early life.
Born in Natick, Massachusetts to John and Linda Whalen, Sara was raised in Greenlawn, New York with her sister Deborah. She attended Harborfields High School in her hometown where she played varsity soccer, basketball, and track (as a sprinter). 
Connecticut Huskies.
After high school, Whalen went to The University of Connecticut, where she was a defender and forward for their women's soccer team. While playing soccer for Connecticut, Whalen was a three-time All-American and was the 1997 NSCAA Division 1 National Player of the Year as well as being named to Soccer America's Collegiate Team of the Decade for the 1990s. Whalen scored both goals in the 1997 NCAA Final Four semifinal match against Notre Dame, as Connecticut won 2–1 to record one of the biggest upsets in NCAA women's soccer history by defeating the previously unbeaten Irish. Whalen was the 1995 and 1996 Big East Defensive Player of the Year, before playing striker her senior season where she recorded 21 goals and 22 assists to lead her team in scoring.
Playing career.
International.
In 1997, Whalen began her career for the US Women's National Soccer Team as an outside defender. She earned her first cap against France, while still in college. The following year, 1998, Whalen had a very successful season scoring two goals and garnering three assists. In 1999, Whalen helped the US Women's National Team win the Women's World Cup, playing every minute of extra-time in the final against China. Whalen was pictured on the cover of "Time Magazine" hugging Brandi Chastain. The following year, Whalen won a silver medal as a part of the US Women's team at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
Club.
In 2001, Whalen was a founding player of the Women's United Soccer Association, playing alongside US teammates Christie Pearce and Tiffeny Milbrett for the New York Power. On June 26, 2002, in a game against the Carolina Courage, Whalen tore her ACL and MCL after a collision with German international Birgit Prinz. This occurred just after recovering from a broken rib. Whalen had surgery, but noticed her knee was infected shortly thereafter. During her second surgery Whalen had a severe allergic reaction, nearly dying. The doctors realized that the infection was in one of the screws, within the ligament of her knee, which had to be removed. Whalen had to go through five surgeries, including moving ligaments from her right to left knee, to repair her injury. This marked the end of Whalen's professional soccer career.
Personal life.
Whalen, who is Jewish, graduated from the University of Connecticut with a degree in psychology. She received her masters degree in psychology from Fordham University and her doctorate from Fairleigh Dickinson University. Whalen lives in New York with her husband, Jon Hess, a Nasdaq trader and former Princeton University lacrosse player and children. In 2004, she ran the New York Marathon in 4 hours 19 minutes 38 seconds.

Simulations and games in economics education

A simulation game is "a game that contains a mixture of skill, chance, and strategy to simulate an aspect of reality, such as a stock exchange". Similarly, Ruohomaki states that "a simulation game combines the features of a game (competition, cooperation, rules, participants, roles) with those of a simulation (incorporation of critical features of reality). A game is a simulation game if its rules refer to an empirical model of reality." A properly built simulation game used to teach or learn economics would closely follow the assumptions and rules of the theoretical models within this discipline.
__TOC__
In economics education.
Economics education studies recommend the adoption of more active and collaborative learning methodologies (Greenlaw, 1999). Simkins (1999) stated “… "teaching practices, which rely heavily on the lecture format, are not doing enough to develop students’ cognitive learning skills, attract good students to economics, and motivate them to continue coursework in the discipline."” (p. 278). This is consistent with the results of a survey published in the American Economic Review by Allgood (2004) that shows that students “rarely take economics as a free elective – especially beyond principles.” (p. 5). More is needed to be done in the classroom to excite students about economics education.
Simulations supplement the standard lecture. Both computerized and non-computer based simulation and games show significant levels of growth in education (see Lean, Moizer, Towler, and Abbey, 2006; Dobbins, Boehlje, Erickson and Taylor, 1995; Gentry, 1990;.
Example in monopolistic competition.
Through a simulation game, students may participate directly in a market by managing a simulated firm and making decisions on price and production to maximize profits. An excellent review of the use of a successful market simulation is given by Motahar (1994) in the Journal of Economics Education. 
A monopolistic competition simulation game can be used as an example in the standard economics classroom or for experimental economics. Economic experiments using monopolistic competition simulations can create real-world incentives that may be used in the teaching and learning of economics to help students better understand why markets and other exchange systems work the way they do. An explanation of experimental economics is given by Roth (1995).
Assumptions of monopolistic competition
A simulation game in monopolistic competition needs to incorporate the standard theoretical assumptions of this market structure, including: 
In a simulation of monopolistic competition, each firm must be small in size, and should not be able to influence the direction of the overall market. Yet each firm has some control over price owing to product differentiation. To be consistent with economic theory, the simulation model should allow entry of new firms to occur as long as profits are greater than normal, and economic profits exist. The entry of new firms will decrease the market price, and eventually cause economic profits to return to zero (see Baye, 2009). 
Controllable decisions in monopolistic competition
To simulate monopolistic competition, the controllable firm decisions of the participants (students) must include, at a minimum, those specified in the standard theoretical model, including (see Baye, 2009): 
Simulation game experience
From an educational point of view, students will have an “opportunity” to learn by their own observations and experience through participation in a simulation game (see Schmidt, 2003). Consistent with the theoretical model of monopolistic competition (see Baye, 2009), student participants would observe and experience that their pricing decisions are controlled by the market. They would “experience” that in the simulation they would have to lower their firm’s price to be competitive as new firms entered the market. In the long-run, they would see the impact of changing plant size. They would observe that the successful firms would take advantage of economies of scale, but would also be careful not to incur diseconomies of scale in the long-run. Students would experience that economic profits cannot be maintained in the long-run. They would see, first hand, that their accounting profits will inevitably decline and move closer to normal profits. This experience provides students an opportunity to learn (as a supplement to the lecture and readings) the economic messages of monopolistic competition.

The Gargoyle (novel)

The Gargoyle is the debut novel by Andrew Davidson and it was published in 2008.
Plot.
The Gargoyle follows two different time lines, one in the form of a story ‘memory’, and one in real time. In real time, an unnamed atheist and former hardcore porn star with a troubled childhood is driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Hallucinating that a volley of arrows is being shot at him from a forest, he swerves off the road and into a ravine. There his car sets alight, and he begins to burn. Just as he thinks he will die, the car tips into a creek and he survives, though badly burned. While recovering, the Burned Man becomes addicted to morphine and believes there is now a snake in his spine. Hatching a suicide plan, he gets a visitor named Marianne Engel, who is a sculptress suspected of having Manic Depression or Schizophrenia. Humoring her at first as she believes she knew him several hundred years prior, they soon begin a friendship/ relationship, and he moves in with her. Throughout, Marianne reveals their ‘past’, and tells tales of love and hope, inspiring the Burned Man to live.
Their ‘past’ story begins in fourteenth-century Germany, at a monastery named Engelthal. A baby is found at the gates, and taken in and raised as a nun. The young sister Marianne is soon found to possess incredible language skills, understanding languages she has never been taught. One day, a man is brought to the monastery. He is severely burned, except for a small rectangle over his heart where there is an arrow wound. The man is a member of a Condotta, a mercenary troop. The nuns believe the burned man is too injured to live. Marianne however looks after him, and he survives. Finding love with each other, the Burned Man and Marianne flee the monastery and begin a new life together, getting married and conceiving a baby.
One day while out shopping, they see the troop that the Burned Man was once a part of. If he is found alive, he will be put to death for being a deserter. Seeing an old friend of his, Brandeis, still with the Condotta, Marianne lures him back to their apartment where the two soldiers reunite like brothers. Brandeis too is eager to escape, so they hatch a plan. After a few months, Brandeis has escaped, and comes to live with Marianne and the Burned Man. But trouble follows as they are hunted down by the Condotta. Heavily pregnant, Marianne and the two men try to escape. Eventually they are caught. Brandeis is executed and the Burned Man is tied up and burned alive once more. In order to spare him pain, Marianne shoots an arrow through his heart, exactly through the first wound. However, the Condotta see her, and chase her over a frozen river. Falling through, Marianne encounters three ‘presences’, who claim they are now her three masters. As penance for the sins she had committed, she was told she now has a chest full of ‘hearts’, that she must give away, which she does in the form of sculpting. She will have one heart left for her lover, who must ‘accept it, and then give it back’ to set her free.
As their love story unfolds past and present, Marianne also spins romantic tales from across the centuries and around the world that defy pain and suffering and bring hope and succor to her deeply damaged friend. But as he starts to fight his demons and the morphine-addicted serpent embedded in his spine, Marianne begins the count down of her hearts...
Reception.
Janet Maslin of "The New York Times" reviewed the book, saying "So for all those who enter here, there is no need to abandon hope. Lessons are learned, love is found, spirits are restored, and faith is revealed, all in the overheated cauldron of Mr. Davidson’s imagination.

Rock art of the Djelfa region

The rock art of the Djelfa region (Algeria) consists of prehistoric engravings of Neolithic age which have been recognized since 1914. Following the Saharan Atlas Mountains they follow on from those, to the west, of south Oran (the regions of Figuig, Ain Sefra, El-Bayadh, Aflou and Tiaret), to which they are related. Comparable engravings have also been described further to the east, in the Constantine (Algeria) region.
Localities and descriptions.
Some of the engravings of the Djelfa region seem to have been known since the 1850s (El Idrissia). Among the best-known, those of Zaccar were discovered in 1907, and Flamand described in 1914 the station of Daïet es Stel. In the mid-1960s the active Djelfa Council of Initiatives undertook to record engravings and paintings, and Father F. de Villaret, who accompanied the visitors, thus made known works from some twenty new stations, notably those of Oued el Hesbaïa and Aïn Naga. In total more than 1,162 engravings have been discovered in the region.
Henri Lhote referred to these engravings in his major work, "Les Gravures rupestres du Sud-oranais", which he published in 1970 in the series of the "Mémoires du Centre de recherches anthropologiques préhistoriques et ethnographiques" (CRAPE). For him they could not "be separated archaeologically from those of south Oran, because they show with some variations the same style, the same technical formulae, the same patinations and the same fauna"(p. 194). It may therefore be possible to analyse them making use of the hypotheses and the classification which he developed. The engravings of the Djelfa region appeared to him like "foreign works, which are a copying (always of inferior quality) from those of south Oran", (p. 193), a region which for the author was "the principal centre of the rock art of the pre-Saharan regions." Some belong to the earliest stage of the large-scale Hartebeest school, like "The Apollo of Ouled Naïl", others are more recent or indeed (stylistically) more decadent.
Regretting "the misreading of the importance of the south Algerian rock art" in the work of Lhote, P. Huard and L. Allard published in 1976 in "Lybica" (CRAPE, Algiers) an important study on "Les figurations rupestres de la région de Djelfa, Sud Algérois." The authors therein recorded forty-three numbered sites or stations which are with some exceptions located near the interior or at the edges of a triangle formed on the north by the town of Djelfa, on the south-west by the village of Sidi Makhlouf and on the south-east by the town of Messaad.
Around the road from Djelfa to Laghouat (just south of Sidi Makhlouf) twenty-three stations are shown: no 28 (Zaccar), 38 (Ishak), 39 (Oued el Youhi), 40 (Guelt el Bidha), 30 (Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur), 31 (Sreissir), 32 (Ben Hallouane), 27 (El Gour), 26 (Ben Hadid), 25 (Kheneg Hilal), 24 (Theniet bou Mediouna II), 23 (Theniet bou Mediouna I), 22 (Theniet el Mzab), 21 (Daïet Geklil), 16 (Oued Mergueb), 20 (Djebel Doum), 19 (Safiet el Baroud), 18 (Morhoma), 33 (Oued Remeila), 34 (Rocher des Pigeons "Pigeon Rock"), 41 (Oued Cheguieg), 17 (Oued el Hesbaïa), 42 (Ntsila). Three stations are in addition mentioned to the east of Djelfa: no 1 (Feidjet Elleben), 2 (Sidi Abdallah ben Ahmed), 3 (Argoub Ezzemla). Three other sites are found to the west: n° 37 (Chouchet Esnober), 36 (Koreiker), 35 (El Idrissia).
Around the road from Djelfa to Messaad (by Moudjbara) twelve stations follow roughly from north to south: no 29 (Saouiet), 4 (Aïn Mouilha), 5 (Daïet es Stel), 6 (Hadjra Mokhotma north), 7 (Hadjara Mokhotma south), 10 (Safiet Bou Khenan)), 9 (Station de l'Autruche "Ostrich"), 8 (Daïet el Hamra), 11 (Bou Sekkin), 12 (Aïn Naga), 13(Atef el Ghorab), 14 (Oued Tamdit). To the east of Messad two final stations are named: no 43 (Oued el Bouir) and 15 (Amoura).
The engravings are located near dwelling sites, shown by the presence of worked flints and debitage, "stratified in various levels or at the foot of cliffs of reddish sandstone, the patina of which can become nearly black, which run along the djebels or stand at the edges of the oueds." They are "by-and-large arranged in little separate groups", the monumental friezes or very richly decorated murals like those of Oued el Hesbaïa or Aïn Naga being "exceptions".
Recognizing that the engravings of the Djelfa region are "similar to those of south Oran by subject and technique", P. Huard and L. Allard judge however that they have a rich cultural content of their own which, notably, show the ancient buffalo as bearers of attributes of the heads, and the fact that almost all the ovines (sheep) are endowed with classic spheroids or horns enclosed in a ring, which are a later stylization of the motif"(p. 67). According to these authors "The introduction in the most ancient stage of the south-Oranian of rams with spheroids can hardly tally with the south-Algerian material, where the most accomplished depictions are often associated with men in developed costume, whereas others, associated with cattle, are clearly of a pastoral epoch" (p. 71).
What is more "The 'bovidian' stage, which would come only in the fourth place in the sequence of the south-Oranian, where it shows a 'decadent' character, is much more developed in the south Algerian." Deducing that these evidences "show that in the two sectors, its origin must certainly be more ancient", Huard and Allard prefer to speak "of a pastoral stage of long duration, with cows and sheep"(p. 71).
The "Hunters" Stage.
In the stage of Hunters the authors gather the depictions of the large wild fauna: ancient buffalo (or Hartebeest), elephants, rhinoceros, lions, ostriches and human figures.
Of the seventeen buffalo recorded in the region, twelve belong to the large, naturalistic art and are similar to those of the south-Oranian. They are found at Oued el Hesbaïa (frieze of three buffalo, including one of more than two meters), Aïn Naga (two buffalo in procession), at Station de l'Autruche (buffalo of 1.50 meters surmounted by a hollowed disc), Djebel Doum (buffalo of 2.35 meters of which the left horn supports a "lengthened semi-circular attribute"), Safiet el Baroud, Hadjra Mokhotma north (buffalo of 2.63 meters, where a human figure seems to touch the horns), Kheneg Hilal (buffalo of 1.20 m.) and Ben Hallouane.
Large, medium or small, the twenty-two elephants seem to belong to various ages. The largest (1 to 2 m), naturalistic in style, are found at Aïn Naga, Theniet bou Mediouna I, Oued Remeilia, Aïn Mouilha, Oued el Hesbaïa (where the "elephant panel", an accumulation of depictions superimposed through the centuries, shows six), Safiet Bou Khenan, Zaccar, Feidjet Elleben and Bou Sekkin.
Seven rhinoceros, of lesser quality and often decadent in style, are recorded at five stations, at Oued Remeila (the oldest), Feidjet Elleben, Bou Sekkin, Aïn Naga, and Oued el Hesbaïa.
Nine representations of Hartebeest antelopes (Bubalis alcelaphus boselaphus) are in naturalistic style. The most famous is that of Zaccar, devoured by a lion (1.50 m in length). A similar scene is found at Daïet el Hamra. At Hadjra Mokhotma north, the animal is confined within a circular trap. Other antelope have been engraved at Safiet el Baroud, Theniet el Mzab and Feidjet Elleben. Otherwise there are numerous antelope-type creatures, often much stylized and in small-scale, like those of Sidi Abdallah ben Ahmed and Safiet bou Khenan, related to the style called "the Tazina School", found in south-Oran.
Eighteen in number, the lions represented can be classed into three groups: "naturalistic lions in profile, three times shown in hunting scenes" (Oued el Hesbaïa, Zaccar, Daïet el Hamra, Hadjara Mokhotma north, Oued Remeilia), "fairly large lions with the stylized head facing and the body in profile", "weaker in style and carving method", "late by comparison with the south-Oran prototypes" (Djebel Doum, Kheneg Hilal, Hadjra Mokhotma south), and thirdly the "smaller felines, lightly drawn and generally late", "of mediocre style and carving method"(pp. 81–85).
The ostriches, fairly numerous, are (with the exception of the representations at Safiet bou Khenan and at Oued el Hesbaïa) "generally of a poor quality." boars, in a group of three, are on the other hand rare, limited to the stations of El Idrissia (a lost group) and Sreissir.
The human depictions are forty in number notably at Oued el Hesbaïa, El Gour, Theniet bou Mediouna II, Aïn Naga, Daïet es Stel, Oued Remeilia, Safiet bou Khenan, Hadjra Mokhotma south and Ben Hadid. Authors attribute to them the model of the "twenty-five characteristic traits of physical or psychic valour of the hunter culture" which they have identified "in the Nile area and in various Saharan regions" (p. 85).
Thus they explain the images of men under animal skins, the wearing of false tails and phallic protections, masks, the presence of ithyphallic depictions and of men touching animals (buffalo, antelopes and elephants at Hadjra Mokhotma north, Theniet bou Mediouna II and Bou Sekkin). Among the weapons they record bows, long and curved weapons, clubs, a hatchet and a shield. Several traps are depicted as well as the hands. Thus, "all the cultural traits of hunters are attested in the Djelfa region, apart from the lasso and the "spirale" (?bolas), which are by compensation strongly represented at Tassili in the Oued Djerat sector."(p. 93).
Early stages of domestication.
Several antelopes and cattle carry signs of human appropriation, especially collars. But it is above all about thirty representations of rams which belong rather to the world of shepherds than of hunters, stretching "through a long period going all the way forward to an advanced stage of domestication" (p. 97). Eight among them are rams with spheroids, of which five are associated with human figures (Aïn Naga, Daïet es Stel, Oued el Hesbaïa, Saouiet).
It is in this group that some of the most famous masterpieces of the region are found, such as the Ram of Aïn Naga, about twice natural size, found by Father F. de Villaret and published by the Djelfa Syndicate of Initiative. The animal, which wears a spheroid framed by feathers, a cheek pendant and a collar with chevrons, is led by a man dressed in a loin-cloth with buttons, wearing bracelets, whose hair-do falls across the nape of his neck in three swathes.
Of the other ovines (sc. sheep), sometimes wearing collars, show their horns enclosed in a ring or by discs (only four depictions show only a collar, or appear without attributes). At Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur a group composed of a ram, a ewe and a large bull denotes "a well established domestication" (p. 106). Other rams can be seen at Khenneg Hilal, Oued el Hesbaïa, Safiet bou Khenan, Theniet el Mzab, Hadjra Mokhotma and Aïn Naga.
The rock art of the Djelfa region shows large naturalistic cattle (Zaccar) and sub-naturalistic ones (Bou Sekkin), the others being of the pastoral era. Their horns are similarly closed into a ring and they sometimes wear devices in segments of a circle, or of textile, which are perhaps means of carrying things (Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur, Teniet el Mzab, Hadjra Mohkotma, Ben Hadid, Bou Sekkin, Safiet bou Khenan and Oued Mergueb).
The "pastoral scenes" often associating men and animals are found at Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur, Hadjra Mohkotma sud, Aïn Mouilha (men with "bandes molletières"), ]Morhoma, Daïet es Stel and Zaccar. Other humanly-signifying depictions, ithyphallic images and women displaying, are found at Safiet bou Khenan, Theniet bou Mediouna II and Daïet el Hamra. Theniet el Mzab there is also found the famous engraving of a man with three-segmented hair style and square shirt-front, and at Aïn Naga that of the "timid lovers" in which the man carries an object like a haricot, shield or quiver surmounted by arrows, (as in south Oran at Khreloua), a hairdo or a headpiece with a tuft of hair falling forwards and with three swathes falling over the neck (a detail which one sees again at Aïn Naga and in south Oran) while the woman shows a carefully maintained hair arrangement, held behind with a clip.
One also finds among the engravings of the Djelfa region hounds and horses of various dates.
In addition three sites with rock paintings are located at Djebel Doum, at Zaccar south (several archers, a possibly human figure and tortoises) and at Hadjra Mokhotma sud.
In 1968 elements of a lithic industry belonging to the Capsian have been found in situ by D. Grébénart at Aïn Naga and dated to 5500 B.C., plus or minus 220.
The probable ancient regional ecology.
North Africa enjoyed a fertile climate during the subpluvial era; what is now the Sahara supported a savanna type of ecosystem, with elephant, giraffe, and other grassland and woodland animals now typical of the Sahel region south of the desert. Historian and Africanist Roland Oliver has described the scene as follows:

Maschinenfabrik Christian Hagans

Maschinenfabrik Christian Hagans (Christian Hagans Engineering Works) was a German locomotive manufacturer founded on 1 July 1857 in Erfurt, Germany, by Christian Hagans.
By the mid-1860s, the company had started building locomotive boilers and other components; in 1872 the first locomotive followed, a narrow gauge engine for a rail gauge of 750 mm. As a result of shortages of space, Hagans often had to limit its operations. For example, the T 15 was built by Henschel because Hagans did not have the necessary capacity. In 1903 the factory site was moved to Ilversgehofen north of the city; only then was large-scale production possible.
On 30 June 1915 the locomotive factory was sold, with effect from 1 April 1916, to the "Maschinenbau R. Wolf Magdeburg-Buckau". In 1928, steam locomotive manufacture finally came to an end in Erfurt. By then Hagans had built 1,251 locomotives. The last Hagans engine was a DRG Class 64.
Hagans locomotive.
A type of articulated steam locomotive is named after Hagans. It had two groups of coupled wheels that moved together and which were connected via swinging lever system ("Schwinghebelsystem"), so that the locomotive managed with one pair of cylinders.
Examples are the Baden VIII d, the Prussian T 13 and the Prussian T 15.

Antonio Bardellino

Antonio Bardellino (San Cipriano d'Aversa, May 4, 1945 – Rio de Janeiro, May 26, 1988) was a powerful Neapolitan Camorrista and boss of the Casalesi clan, having a prominent role in the organized crime in the province of Caserta during the 1980s. He was one of the last of the old style Camorra godfathers.
Powerful Camorrista.
Originally from San Cipriano d'Aversa in the Province of Caserta, Bardellino was an important Cosa Nostra affiliate in the region of Campania. "Bardellino was the reference point of all Camorra clans, even the ones that could not stand him. With his charisma he managed to maintain a certain equilibrium in Campania", according to the "pentito" Pasquale Galasso. He was the founder of the Casalesi clan, around which for almost a decade moved a united confederation of families (Schiavone, Bidognetti, Zagaria, Iovine, Venosa) rooted in a large territory which extended from southern Lazio through the "agro aversano" (countryside near Aversa), to Naples.
Ties with Cosa Nostra.
He had close and powerful contacts within the Sicilian Mafia, initially with the Porta Nuova family of Pippo Calò. He was one of the few Camorra bosses who were also initiated in Cosa Nostra. Together with Lorenzo Nuvoletta and Michele Zaza he was sworn in to seal a pact on cigarette smuggling in 1975. 
In contrast to the Nuvoletta brothers who were allied with the Corleonesi headed by Luciano Leggio and Salvatore Riina, Bardellino was allied with Rosario Riccobono, Stefano Bontade, Gaetano Badalamenti, and Tommaso Buscetta, all heads of fallen Palermo families which were defeated by the Corleonesi in the Second Mafia War, and forced to flee.
Underworld Rackets.
It is believed that Antonio Bardellino was the initiator of the Casalesi clan in the area of Casal di Principe and San Cipriano d'Aversa, especially due to the transformation he implemented within the clan. The rituals of affiliation remained as well as the rate of murders, but the leap in quality was the continued infiltration of the legal capitalist economy with the proceeds of illicit drug trafficking. This was favoured by the 1980 Irpinia earthquake and the subsequent reconstruction, that prompted the families to create a consortium for their companies that performed the work of earth-moving, building houses and roads. Another factor was the great entrepreneurial ability of Bardellino himself. He owned an import/export firm of fish meal together with other clans, which in fact covered up a cocaine smuggling operation from Brazil to Italy. Besides trafficking cocaine trade, he was involved in the heroin trade with Lorenzo Nuvoletta and Ciro Mazzarella, supplying the Sicilian Mafia.
In the 1980s, Bardellino realized that cocaine, not heroin, would become the more profitable drug and organized a trafficking operation smuggling it from Latin America to Aversa via a fish flour import-export business. Heroin was smuggled as well, and shipments to the Gambino crime family were concealed inside espresso filters. When one shipment was intercepted by the authorities, Bardellino reportedly called John Gotti and told him; "Don't worry, now we're sending twice as much the other way".
Nuova Famiglia.
Bardellino was the main exponent of the Nuova Famiglia (NF), a confederation of clans that was formed to contrast the growing power of the predominant Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO), led by Raffaele Cutolo. The NF consisted of Bardellino, Michele Zaza (a Camorra boss with strong ties with Cosa Nostra), the Gionta clan (from Torre Annunziata), the Nuvoletta clan from Marano, the Alfieri clan of Saviano led by Carmine Alfieri, the Galasso clan of Poggiomarino (led by Pasquale Galasso), the Giuliano clan from Naples' quarter Forcella (led by Luigi Giuliano and the Vollaro clan from Portici (led by Luigi Vollaro). 
The resulting war between the NF and the NCO resulted in a large number of victims from both sides, and ended with the NCO's defeat and the victory of the NF. However, with Cutolo and the NCO out of the picture, the NF alliance soon disintegrated, with a war breaking out between the Bardellino and Nuvoletta clans towards the end of 1983.
War with the Nuvolettas.
While the Second Mafia War between the Corleonesi and the Bontade-Buscetta-Inzerillo-Badalamenti faction was being fought in Sicily, its effects were being felt on the Campanian underworld. The Corleonesi boss, Salvatore Riina, mandated Lorenzo Nuvoletta to order the murder of Tommaso Buscetta. Nuvoletta, in turn, passed the order to Bardellino. The order was not brought to an end, because Bardellino had been good friends with Buscetta in Sicily, and had once shared the same house with Buscetta in Brazil when the latter was absconding. He also deeply distrusted the Nuvoletta's and was unwilling to accept the supremacy of the Nuvoletta brothers with the interference of the Corleonesi. Bardellino's attitude soon marked him for death, and he would spend the last years of life in hiding outside Italy, including Spain, Brazil and Santo Domingo. 
Towards the end of 1982, thanks to a tip off from the local police, Antonio Bardellino managed to evade capture in his Rio de Janeiro apartment. Despite this setback, a meeting was soon arranged between Bardellino and the Nuvolettas in Zurich, but Aniello Nuvoletta was arrested at the rendezvous. Many other leaders of the Nuvoletta clan would have been arrested had they not suffered a chance accident in Northern Italy, near the Swiss border. Bardellino was arrested in Barcelona in Spain in November 1983, but he was inexpicably released on bail and disappeared soon afterwards.
Victory.
The clash with the Nuvoletta clan resulted in Bardellino's victory. An attack was made at the Nuvoletta family's farm in Marano which resulted in the death of Ciro Nuvoletta, one of the brothers. Two months later, events culminated with an attack at Torre Annunziata, an area infamous for its illegal activities, which led to the massacre of eight members of the Gionta clan allied with the Nuvolettas at the Circolo dei Pescatori (fisherman's club). Another twenty four were wounded. This episode was known as the Torre Annunziata massacre in the local press, and is perhaps the worst gangland massacre to ever take place in Italy. 
This victory further allowed Antonio Bardellino to expand his sphere of control and influence to include almost the entire province of Caserta and Naples. In spite of being a fugitive sought by Interpol, Bardellino could exercise his power and coordinate criminal activities unhindered, but the disagreements came with the Casalesi itself.
Assassination.
According to the official version of the story, on May 26, 1988, Antonio Bardellino was murdered by his right hand man, Mario Iovine in his Brazilian home at Búzios, a beach side resort for the rich and famous in the State of Rio de Janeiro, as part of an internal feud within the Casalesi. However, this story has never been clarified because his body was never found and the alleged assassin, Iovine, was himself murdered in Portugal in 1991 while using a phone booth. These circumstances have fueled a legend that Bardellino is still alive, and has left power in the hands of the other families within the Casalesi clan in order to ensure the survival of his family. 
When his old friend, Tommaso Buscetta who later became a "pentito" was asked about the status of Bardellino during a testimony before the Antimafia Commission, he replied: "Is it already obvious that Bardellino died? I do not know, but I do not believe that he is dead." After the news of Bardellino's death spread, his family left their homes and native areas to take refuge in Formia where they still reside. After the disappearance of Antonio Bardellino, the five families (Schiavone, Iovine, Bidognetti, De Falco and Zagaria) took control, each with their own army.
His former ally Umberto Ammaturo, who turned state witness (pentito) also said Bardellino was still alive when he gave a rare interview to La Repubblica newspaper in May 2010.

Dazincourt

Joseph-Jean-Baptiste Albouy (Marseille, 11 December 1747 - Paris, 28 March 1809), stage name Dazincourt, was a French actor.
Life.
Educated by the Oratorians, Dazincourt entered the service of the maréchal de Richelieu in 1766 and had a taste of acting in comedies of manners. Deciding to make this his profession, he left Paris in secret for Brussels to study under D'Hannetaire, then at the peak of his reputation.
After acting at the Théâtre de la Monnaie from 1771 to 1776, Dazincourt returned to Paris and made his debut at the Comédie-Française on 21 November 1776 in the rôle of Crispin in "Les Folies amoureuses" by Jean-François Regnard. He became a sociétaire of this theatre in 1778 and remained one until his death.
In December 1776 the "Mercure de France" commented on his débuts : "This actor has a well-formed talent, a reasoned manner, and much intelligence, finesse and truth-to-life. He is a good comic-actor without being a farceur, and pleasing without being anything more."
During the night of 2 September 1793, he and 12 other actors of the Théâtre Français also felt to have remained faithful to the monarchy were arrested and imprisoned in the prison des Madelonnettes, for putting on the allegedly seditious play "Pamela".
His greatest role was that of Figaro in "Le Mariage de Figaro" and in "Le Barbier de Séville". His memoirs were published by Henri-Alexis Cahaisse in the year of his death.

Madelonnettes Convent

The Madelonnettes Convent ("couvent des Madelonnettes") was a Paris convent in the 3rd arrondissement of Paris. It was located in what is now a rectangle between 6 rue des Fontaines du Temple (where there are the remains of one of its walls), rue Volta and rue du Vertbois, and part of its site is now occupied by the lycée Turgot. As the Madelonnettes Prison ("prison des Madelonnettes") during the French Revolution, its prisoners included the writers the Marquis de Sade and Nicolas Chamfort, the politician Jean-Baptiste de Machault d'Arnouville and the actor Dazincourt.
Convent.
Origins.
Its origins date back to 1618, when the wine merchant Robert de Montry - after being rebuffed by the local prostitutes in his attempts to reform them - finally decided to put them back to the right path whilst being accommodated in his own home. With the aid of M. Du Pont (curé of Saint-Nicolas des Champs), the Capuchin Father Athanase Molé and M. de Fresne (an officer of the Gardes du Corps du Roi and a friend of Saint Vincent de Paul among others), Montry worked to spread his charitable work to other prostitutes. Quickly overtaken by their success, at first they rented rooms in the "faubourg Saint-Honoré", before Robert de Montry lent them a house he owned in the "quartier de la Croix-Rouge". A chapel for the house was improvised, served by Benedictines from "Saint-Germain des Prés".
The idea of creating an actual convent was down to the patronage of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul and the generosity of the Marquise de Maignelay (née Claude-Marguerite de Gondi, sister of Jean-François de Gondi, archbishop of Paris), who, on 16 July 1620, acquired from sister Dubuisson a property in "rue des Fontaines", between the "Abbaye Saint-Martin des Champs" and the "Temple" fortress enclosure, and left them 101,600 livres in her will. In 1625, Louis XIII granted them 3,000 livres in rents, and they were accorded a constitution by pope Urban VIII in 1630]. Most of the buildings were constructed in 1637, with the first chapel inaugurated by Anne of Austria on 22 March 1648 and a church built from 1680 onwards and consecrated on 2 September 1685.
History.
This large gathering of sinners freely choosing the way of redemption slowly evolved into a more classical convent establishment in which women or girls suspected of misconduct would be confined on the orders of the king, judges or even just at their family's request, the most famous example being the courtesan Ninon de l'Enclos, imprisoned there in 1657 at the request of Anne of Austria, now queen-mother (though according to Gédéon Tallemant des Réaux, Ninon did not remain there long, so strong was the pressure of her gallants that gathered around the convent to demand her release). A number of them came from rich families who provided the convent with a large pension. It was thus necessary therefore to strengthen the supervision, which was confided in turn to four sisters of the "Visitation of Saint-Antoine" (1629–1677), the Ursulines (1677–1720) and finally to the nuns of Saint-Michel (1720 onwards), renowned for their severity.
The convent at its peak housed 165 "pensionnaires", organized in three orders, each with a separate building: 
Prison.
French Revolution.
After the decree of the National Assembly of 13 February 1790 abolishing convents, a last inventory of the convent's goods and income was carried out on 17 March that same year. Though the convent officially closed in 1790, the nuns were only dispersed by stages, since a new mother-superior and bursar were named on 21 March 1791. 
In the face of a new wave of imprisonments, in 1793 the convent buildings were converted into a prison for political prisoners and common criminals, with its first prisoners arriving on 4 April under the direction of the "commissaire" Marino and the "concierge" Vaubertrand. The tempo of arrests quickened from May 1793 (up to 47 a day) and this led to overcrowding, with a prison only originally meant for 200 people housing up to 319 by 27 Messidor, crammed into cells only each. Common criminals, nicknamed "les pailleux", were held on the ground floor, with people of varying origins referred to as "suspects". Despite the crowded conditions, the mood was good, with improvised poems, singing, music-making and gymnastics, all under the jailors' eyes, but despite this, the prison regime was hard and insanitary. Commissaire Marino forbade prisoners to go into the courtyard, under the pretext that their detention was only provisional whilst they were awaiting transfer to another location. Promiscuity favoured the spread of infectious diseases such as smallpox, which claimed several victims.
At the end of December 1793, the political prisoners were moved to (among others) the Port-Libre, Picpus, and Saint-Lazare prisons, and the common criminals were sent to Bicêtre. Little by little the "Madelonnettes" was emptied of prisoners after the events of Thermidor, and it reopened in 1795 as a women's prison for female criminals and debtors and young women shut up for correction by their fathers (as an annex to the prison Saint Lazare). An image of the prison can be seen in a painting by Louis Léopold Boilly now at the Musée Carnavalet.
19th century.
The prison remained a women's prison until April 1831, and also had the population of other prisons transferred to it, such as the public daughters of the "Petite Force" (1828) and the prisoners at the "Prison Sainte-Pélagie" (1831). Finally all the prisoners from La Roquette Prisons were transferred to the "Madelonnettes" in 1836 and it became a "maison d'arrêt" for men on their way to "La Force". In the wake of the 1848 Revolution large numbers of politicians were imprisoned here, and in 1865-1866 the "Madelonnettes" was finally demolished by Haussmann to build the "rue de Turbigo" (in works which were photographed by Charles Marville) and replaced by the still existing "Prison de la Santé".
Pour ne pas gâcher une telle force de travail, on créa alors des ateliers ; 219 d'entre elles furent affectées aux travaux du linge, des cardes ou de la gomme, tandis que 86 restaient inoccupées, 86 à l'infirmerie des syphilitiques, 54 à celle des fiévreuses et 11 à celle des galeuses.
De telles conditions de détentions en menèrent plus d'une au suicide, comme l'illustre une gravure d'un ouvrage de médecine consacré à cette matière.
Les bâtiments furent à nouveau vidés de leurs prisonnières à la suite de la révolution de 1830, et transformés en prison pour enfants du 8 août 1831 jusqu'au 11 septembre 1836, à l'ouverture de la prison spécialisée de la Petite Roquette (on comptait 300 enfants détenus en 1833).
Temporairement succursale de La Force, la prison devint à partir du 1er janvier 1838 une maison d'arrêt (c'est-à-dire lieu de détention provisoire) pour adultes et enfants, répartis à partir de 1842 en 8 catégories, selon leur âge et la gravité de leurs crimes. Les bâtiments furent aménagés pour isoler les groupes les uns des autres. La tradition des ateliers se perpétua (tailleurs, chaussonniers, cordonniers, serruriers, ébénistes, semeleurs et... fabrication de baleines pour corsets). Autre tradition, la croissance de la population carcérale fut vertigineuse : de 240 en 1842 à 442 en 1845.

<doc id="19133893" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19133893" title="Korzok Monastery">
Korzok Monastery

Korzok, also known as Karzok or Kurzok, is a Tibetan Buddhist monastery belonging to the Drukpa Lineage and ancient village on the western bank of Tsomoriri Lake in Leh District, Ladakh, India. Korzok, situated at , houses a Shakyamuni Buddha and other statues. It is home to about 35 monks.
In the past, the monastery was the headquarters of the Rupshu Valley. As a Drugpa order monastery, it was under the jurisdiction of the Hemis monastery. Two or four monks were assigned to run the monastery.
The highly revered monastery is 300 years old. The Tsomoriri Lake in front of it is also held in reverence, and considered equally sacred by the local people. With the efforts of the WWF-India the Tsomoriri has been pledged as a 'Sacred Gift for a Living Planet' by the local community (mostly Chang-pa herdsmen). As a result, the area has been opened up for tourists.
Etymology.
The word ‘Korzok’ is a derivative of two words, namely ‘Kor’ meaning a place in the Ladakhi language and ‘Zok’ which is said to be a derivative of the word ‘dzot-pa’ meaning “manager”. Over the years, the last letter of the word was changed to ‘k’ to the derivative word Zok and together with Kor came to be known as “Korzok”. Another explanation attributed is that shepherds working for the monasteries in the nearby hamlets kept the king’s cattle at this place, not only to tend them but to also extract milk, cheese and butter. Hence, the place came to be known as “Korzok”.
It is said that the nomads were exploited by the Monastery as they were paid very meagre amounts for the services rendered. Hence the place was given the name 'Korzok' (meaning: acquired by unfair means).
History.
The history of Korzok is traced back to kings who ruled in the inhospitable terrain and fought several wars. They suffered several setbacks in wars and had to lead a nomadic life in isolation. One of the kings of this nomadic lineage had sent his emissary to Tibet seeking help. He brought a Lama from Tibet who established the monastery at Korzok about 300 years ago. Since then the nomads preferred to change their animistic religion and adopt to Buddhism. They preferred living peacefully and in harmony with their surroundings and animals. The reign of the nomadic kingdom ended with their last King Tsewang Yurgyal, who ruled until August 1947 when India became a democratic country.
Korzok was in the Central Asian trade route till 1947 and was the headquarters of Ripshu Valley. One of the kings, Rupshu Goba, who lived there with his family, built nine permanent houses there.
Now there are 50 houses in the village but the floating population of the nomads, establishing their tents (made of yak hair or skin) in summer, adds to the agricultural operations in the region. The tents are provided with vents at the top to let out smoke. Pashmina (yak’s wool) is the valuable product that the Changmas trade along with the salt that they extract from large salt fields in the area, such as the springs at Puga. They barter these two products for food grains and other necessities. In Korzok, in recent years, building activity is on the rise with the nomadic tribes changing their life style.
Structures.
Korzok monastery as seen now is said to have been re-built in the 19th century on the right bank of the Tsomoriri River. The old monastery was built on a gentle slope, unlike other monasteries that are generally perched on hill tops. An impressive "photong" is also located near to the Gompa. A number of Chortens are also seen near the monastery. Korzok settlement is considered as one of the oldest settlements of the world.
The monastery houses the statue of Shakyamuni Buddha along with images of other deities. The monastery has beautiful paintings (Thangkas); old paintings which have been restored.
Geography.
Korzok Monastery is situated on the western bank of India's Tsomoriri Lake, one of the highest lakes in the world. It covers an area of . The water of the lake is partly brackish and partly sweet. Its depth in the lake is . The valley formed by the Tsomoriri and other lakes, is known as the Rupshu Valley. The lake and its surrounding area is a Ramsar designated wetland.
Korzok is hemmed between Ladakh in the north and Tibet in the east and Zanskar in the west. The Changthang plateau is the geographical setting with snow peaks that is the source of water to the Lake. The Rupshu Valley, also called the Chungthang valley, is a unique landscape. The barley fields around Korzok village inhabited by the nomadic Chang-pa herdsmen (apart from the monks staying in the monastery), have been described as the highest cultivated land in the world. The nomadic herdsmen seen here living in tents only, rear herds of goats, cows and yaks. The wildlife seen in the area consists of Himalayan birds, wild ass (Kiang), foxes and marmots. The streams, which rise in the valley, are used for irrigation. Summer temperatures in the area reach a high of and a low of .
Local festival.
The Korzok Gu-stor festival is held at the monastery and attracts many Chang-pa, the Tibetan plateau nomadic herdsmen. The festival lasts for two days (July/August) and ends with the dismemberment and dispersal of the 'Storma' (sacrificial cake) by the leader of the Black Hat dancers in a ceremony called 'Argham' (Killing). The ceremony symbolizes the destruction of evil and pays homage to the assassination of the Tibetan apostate King Lang-dar-ma, by a Buddhist monk in the mid 9th century. At the festival masks are worn by the dancers to represent the Dharmapalas (guardian divinities of the Buddhist pantheon), and the patron divinities of the Drukpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism.
The annual monastic festival is also held not only at Korzok but also at the Thuje in the Chungthan valley where the nomadic tribes fervently participate in the rituals. They not only make donations to the monasteries but also dedicate one son from each family to the monastery. It is said that the local nomads are so dedicated to Buddhism that opposite to their tents they allocate space to keep symbolic statue images of the Rinpoche, usually the Dalai Lama, along with the seven offering cups, in perfect harmony with their own folk (nomadic) religious deities and spirits.
Visitor information.
The monastery is located to the southeast of Leh in eastern Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir, at a road distance of . It is also approachable from Manali. The Leh-Manali Highway or Manali-Tsokar route leads to Tsomoriri Lake and the Korzok Monastery. The Leh-Manali route passes through Upshi, Chungthang to Tsomoriri Lake, a distance of . The road, climbing though the Tanglang La Pass, is the second highest in the world.
Leh is also connected by air with many destinations in India.
A permit (obtainable at Leh only) is essential for entry into the area. Only tented accommodation, pitched on the banks of the Tsomoriri Lake, is available for visitors.

History of Shit

"History of Shit" ("Histoire de la merde: Prologue") is a 1978 book by French psychoanalyst Dominique Laporte (1949–1984). It uses an idiosyncratic method of historical genealogy derived from, among others, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Georges Bataille, and Michel Foucault, to show how the development of sanitation techniques in Western Europe affected the formation of modern notions of individuality. Laporte examines this influence through the historical processes of urbanization, the apotheosis of nationalism, practices of capitalist exchange, and linguistic reform.
In the English translation of the book by Nadia Benabid and Rodolphe el-Khoury in 1993, el-Khoury explains how for Laporte, "the history of shit becomes the history of subjectivity" and how his book becomes a "a prehistory to modernity and the modern subject" (viii). el-Khoury identifies Laporte's scholarly strategy of joining the ridiculous and the profound as inherently political. Laporte's stated ambition is to "remove a few masks with the roar of our laughter, laugh them off the figures of power" (ix).
In a previous work with Renée Balibar, "Le Français national: politique et pratiques de la langue nationale sous la Revolution Française", Laporte studied language reforms carried out in the name of the French Revolution.

Woodbrook Golf Club

Woodbrook Golf Club is a golf club located in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland. It was established as a private club in 1921 by Sir Stanley Cochrane. Woodbook was first affiliated to the Golfing Union of Ireland (GUI) in 1926. Sir Stanley had previously indulged his enthusiasm for cricket at Woodbrook, a fact that is still reflected in the pavilion style clubhouse and the cricket bell which tolled the start and finish of play and now hangs in the bar.
However it is as a venue for top-class international golf that Woodbrook is primarily famous. Woodbrook hosted the first major professional tournament in Ireland, the Hennessy Tournament in 1958. This one-off event proved so popular amongst the Irish sporting public that the following year it became the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes Tournament with the then-biggest prize fund of 5,000 guineas. Woodbrook also played host to the Carroll's International tournament on ten occasions between 1963 and 1974, and as a result, was the first host of the revived Irish Open when it returned in 1975.
Woodbrook has also hosted the Irish PGA Championship on six occasions (1977, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1990 and 1991).

Self Destruct Tour

Self-Destruct Tour (a pun on the name of "Mr. Self Destruct") was a concert tour in support of industrial rock act Nine Inch Nails' "The Downward Spiral " album, which took place in early 1994, running until mid-1996, and was broken into 8 legs.
The tour was filmed for the "Closure" tour documentary, a double-VHS set that documented live performances of the tour as well as the band from 1989–1991, and an extra VHS tape featuring the band's music videos, which was released in late 1997. It was rumored to have been re-released in 2005, but Interscope Records refused to release it, which led the content's mysterious leak onto torrent websites in DVD format - supposedly at the hands of Reznor himself.
This was Nine Inch Nails' first tour since the early 1990s shows for Pretty Hate Machine. During this time, Nine Inch Nails' music became angrier and more aggressive with releases like Broken and "The Downward Spiral", which led to the concerts being often very violent and personal, with band members often injuring themselves. The stage set-up consisted of grungy curtains which would pulled down and up for visuals which might be played during songs (such as 'Hurt'), or pulled up for live performances of more aggressive songs. The back of the stage was littered with darker and standing lights, with very little actual lights.
Trent Reznor overhauled the band line-up and image for the tour; guitarist Robin Finck joined to play guitar while Danny Lohner joined on to play bass guitar. However, Chris Vrenna and James Woolley were brought back from the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series. Image-wise, instead of the sloppy, low-budget style for previous tours, the band often dressed in black leather smothered in cornstarch, with band members often changing their hairstyles to radical hair styles for every concert. Robin Finck used makeup to hide his eyebrows, and Reznor would often don his 'fishnet gloves' (as they would come to be known) for the show. The band's showy yet intense tour style gave the band comparisons to David Bowie, whom Reznor was a big fan of. Later in the tour, Bowie and Reznor's protégé, Marilyn Manson, would often join the frontman on stage to sing their songs—as evident in the "Closure" tour documentary.
North American Leg.
Reeling from the success of" Pretty Hate Machine" and "Broken" as well as the band's divorce from TVT Records, the nearly immediate success of "The Downward Spiral "led to Nine Inch Nails playing larger venues. This debuted the band's new grungy and messy image in which band members would often come out in ragged clothes slathered in corn starch. They would often destroy their instruments at the end of concerts, attack each other, and stage-dive into the crowd. This led to Nine Inch Nails's notoriety as a live act. The shows often consisted of songs from "Pretty Hate Machine", "Broken", "The Downward Spiral", as well as songs such as "Get Down Make Love" and "Dead Souls", which were formerly staples of their live show.

D'Hannetaire

Jean-Nicolas Servandoni, stage name D'Hannetaire, (3 November 1718 - 1 January 1780) was a French actor and theatre director.
Life.
He was born in Grenoble, the son of the Florentine painter Giovanni Niccolò Servandoni (also known as Jean-Nicolas Servandoni) and his wife Marie-Josèphe Gravier, known for his façade for the église Saint-Sulpice in Paris. D'Hannetaire seems to have begun his acting career in Germany, around 1740. He played at the château d'Arolsen, for the prince of Waldeck, around 1743 and was in Aix-la-Chapelle in 1744, from whence he arrived in Liège around the end of the year. In November he presented a "Divertissement nouveau de chants et de danses" for prince-bishop Jean-Théodore of Bavaria and, also whilst in Liège, married the comic-actor Marguerite-Antoinette Huet (stage name Mllle Danicourt) on 17 February 1745. The couple arrived in Brussels in October 1745 and D'Hannetaire took up leadership of the Théâtre de la Monnaie, from which he was dislodged four months later by Favart. He and his wife integrated into the troupe of maréchal de Saxe and he once again took direction of the theatre on the departures of the French troupes at the end of 1748.
He then played at Toulouse and Bordeaux, then made his debut at the Comédie-Française on 27 April 1752 in the rôle of Orgon in "Tartuffe". However, he preferred to return to Brussels, in Durancy's troupe, in which he was entrusted "les rôles à manteaux" and "les rôles de Crispin". In 1755 he took over from Durancy as head of this troupe, and stayed so until 1771, sometimes alone, sometimes in association with other actors.
D'Hannetaire and his wife had 8 children, 2 of whom also became notable actors :
In 1768, he renounced acting to become a notary, in the historic context of the excommunication of actors "in virtue of an old usage of comedy". Nevertheless, he continued to act at Brussels for several years, before having to retire until his death in Brussels.

Chink-a-chink

Chink-a-Chink is a magic trick in which four small objects, usually arranged in a square, rectangular or diamond formation, are covered by the magician's bare hands, two at a time. The objects appear to jump invisibly from corner to corner, usually ending up all together. Objects most commonly used for the trick are corks, dice, bottle caps, brass weights, and coins. However, the coin version of the trick has now evolved into a more or less separate and distinct magical genre known as "Matrix" whose inventor and chief exponent is Al Schneider. 
The trick was famously covered in Edwin Sach's seminal book "Sleight of Hand" in 1877, utilizing four sugar cubes. Max Malini popularized the trick in the early 20th century using cut-down wine corks and is generally credited with naming the trick. Although the name was probably meant to be onomatopoetic, it can be misinterpreted as a racial slur and has been given alternative names. Leo Horowitz perpetuated Malini's version while adding refinements of his own (using covered sugar cubes of a type popular in supper clubs and night spots in the 30s, 40s and 50's). The late magician, Doug Henning, performed Chink-a-Chink on television in the early 1970s, using seashells. 
Sean McWeeney, the author of the first e-book om the has demonstrated that the trick is a lot older than was previously thought, with a history stretching back to early/mid 19th century Germany. Prefabricated Chink-a-chink sets are, or were until recently, available on special order from various magic-makers, including François Danis of France and Jim Riser of the USA. Professional magicians, however, apparently prefer the traditional "found objects" to the artificial ones, reducing demand for the product.

Don Broadhurst

Don Broadhurst is an English professional boxer who competes in the Flyweight division. He hails from Birmingham and currently boxes for Frank Warren's Sports Network. He held the Commonwealth super flyweight champion from October 31, 2008 to December 11, 2009.
Amateur career.
Broadhurst was a standout amateur who won the Flyweight ABA championship in 2003 and Gold for England in the 2006 Commonwealth Games. He defeated South Africa's Jackson Van Chauke in the final of the games and was the first of five boxers to win gold for England that day. The fight lasted into the 3rd round when it was stopped on the 'outscored' rule.
Early Professional career.
Don decided to turn pro in June 2006 and signed for Sports Network saying "“I feel the time is right to turn professional. I have represented England and the UK as an amateur, and they were the greatest times of my life, part of me wants to go to the Olympics still, but I'm positive now is the time, and I can go on to better my amateur achievements as a pro”". His first fight was 3 months later when he defeated journeyman Delroy Spencer at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton. In June 2008 he fought in his home city of Birmingham for the first time beating Frenchman Alain Bonnel on points over six rounds. it was also the first time he had fought in the whole of 2008 following a string of cancelled bouts.
Commonwealth Champion.
Despite not fighting regularly in 2008, Don still managed to win his first professional title in October. Fighting in his home town of Birmingham once more he headlined a bill that saw him win the vacant Commonwealth super flyweight crown. The opponent in the other corner was Isaac Quaye of Ghana with Broadhurst winning a unanimous decision over 12 rounds. The win meant that he had now won the Commonwealth title as an amateur and as a professional. Despite this fact the bill itself at the Aston Villa Leisure Centre will no doubt be more remembered for Peter Buckley, the journeyman, winning in his 300th and last bout. Broadhurst made the first defence of his title in March 2009 at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham defeating another boxer from Ghana, Isaac Owusu in the 11th round. On the 24th April Broadhurst fought his third Ghanain boxer in a row with a 6th round stoppage of Asamoah Wilson for his second title defence.
Unification bout with Haskins.
On December 11, 2009 after 11 straight wins and two defences of his belt Broadhurst lost to reigning British super flyweight champion Lee Haskins in a unification clash. The fight, in Newport Wales, saw Haskins become a double champion after scoring a unanimous decision over 12 scrappy rounds. Speaking of his disappointment at having lost for the first time Broadhurst claimed that it was ""one bad night"" told Boxing News ""I just stayed in my bed, depressed. It was one of the worst things that has ever happened to me, it was like a family member had died or something – that is how bad it was"."
Defeat to Ali.
Broadhurst didn't return to the ring until 18 September 2010 when he hoped that an appearance on Frank Warrens 'Magnificent Seven' event held at the LG Arena in Birmingham would re-ignite his career. It was not to be however as he lost for the second time in a row, this time to Najah Ali a fighter who had fought only five professional contests. The contest was fought at bantamweight which was above Broadhursts natural weight but the loss to Ali by two rounds was bitterly disappointing for the local man.

Adrian Kantrowitz

Adrian Kantrowitz (October 4, 1918 – November 14, 2008) was an American cardiac surgeon whose team performed the world's first pediatric heart transplant at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn on December 6, 1967. The actual surgery was performed in the middle of the night by his resident. It was only the second time that a human heart had been transplanted into another human being, taking place just three days after Christiaan Barnard's seminal attempt in South Africa made headlines around the world and ushered in a new era in clinical organ transplantation. Kantrowitz also invented the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), a left ventricular assist device (L-VAD), and an early version of the implantable pacemaker.
Biography.
Kantrowitz was born in New York City on October 4, 1918. His mother was a costume designer and his father ran a clinic in the Bronx. He told his mother as a three-year old that he wanted to be a doctor, and as a child built an electrocardiograph from old radio parts together with his brother.
Education and military service.
He graduated from New York University in 1940, having majored in math. He attended the Long Island College of Medicine (now SUNY Downstate Medical Center) and was awarded his medical degree in 1943 as part of an effort to accelerate the availability of physicians during World War II. During an internship at the Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn, he developed an interest in neurosurgery, and had a paper published in 1944 paper, "A Method of Holding Galea Hemostats in Craniotomies", in which he proposed a new type of clamp to be used while performing a craniotomy during brain surgery.
He served for two years as a battalion surgeon in the United States Army Medical Corps. Kantrowitz was discharged from the Army in 1946 with the rank of major.
After his military service, he switched to specialize in cardiac surgery due to the paucity of positions in neurosurgery. In 1947, he was an Assistant Resident in Surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan.
Montefiore Hospital.
He was on the surgical staff of Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx from 1948 until 1955. He started at Montefiore as Assistant Resident in Surgery and Pathology, and progressed to Cardiovascular Research Fellow before becoming Chief Resident in Surgery. At the New York Academy of Medicine, on October 16, 1951, he screened the world's first movies taken inside a living heart, showing the sequential opening and closing of the mitral valve inside a beating heart. Using dogs and other animals as experimental subjects, Kantrowitz developed an artificial left heart, an early version of an oxygen generator for use as a component in a heart-lung machine and a treatment for coronary artery disease in which blood vessels would be rearranged during surgery. He also developed a device that allowed individuals who were paralyzed to have their bladders empty through a signal sent from a radio-controlled device.
Maimonides Medical Center.
From 1955 to 1970, he held surgical posts at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. In February 1958, a heart-lung machine Kantrowitz had developed was used during open heart surgery on a six-year-old boy while the surgeons repaired a one-inch hole between the chambers of the boy's heart that was present since birth. In an October 1959 lecture at the American College of Surgeons, Kantrowitz and colleague Dr. William M. P. McKinnon reported on a procedure in which a portion of muscle from the diaphragm was used to create a "booster" heart to help pump blood in a dog, taking over as much as 25% of the pumping burden of the natural heart. The booster heart functions by receiving a signal sent by a radio transmitter triggered by the pulse of the natural heart. Kantrowitz noted that the procedure was not ready to be performed on humans. Ruff, a "friendly dog of unknown ancestry" was honored by the New York Academy of Sciences as "research dog of the year" for his unwitting participation in the implantation of a booster heart 18 months earlier in a procedure performed by Kantrowitz.
In the early 1960s, Kantrowitz developed an implantable artificial pacemaker together with General Electric. The first of these pacemakers was implanted in May 1961. The device included an external control unit that could adjust the pacing rate from 64 to 120 beats per minute to allow the patient to deal with physical or emotional stress.
Throughout the 1960s, he collaborated with a team that included his brother, engineer Arthur Kantrowitz, on the development of a left ventricular assist device. Building on his experiments with dogs, he performed the world's second permanent partial mechanical heart implantation in a human on February 4, 1966, which was successful, though the patient died 24 hours after surgery as a result of preexisting liver disease. His second implant of a partial mechanical heart on a 63-year old woman, on May 18, 1966, lasted 13 days, until the patient died of a stroke. During these almost two weeks after the surgery, the patient was improving, and was able to sit up and eat well. This surgery used a valveless device developed with his brother Arthur in which the natural electrical impulses of the patient's heart controlled the action of the pump.
In what turned out to be a race with South African cardiac surgeon, Dr. Christiaan Barnard and Americans Norman Shumway and Richard Lower, Kantrowitz prepared for a potential human heart transplant by transplanting hearts in 411 dogs over a five-year period together with members of his surgical team. On June 29, 1966, by which time Kantrowitz had completed the necessary technical research, he and his team had located a donor and recipient. Due to disagreements with senior staffers Howard Joos and Harry Weiss, Kantrowitz was forced to wait until cardiac death (instead of the more modern use of brain death) to retrieve the donor heart, which was found to be useless. Barnard performed the first human-to-human heart transplant on December 3, 1967, almost a year and half after Kantrowitz's first attempt
On December 6, 1967, Kantrowitz performed the first human heart transplantation in the United States, removing the heart of a brain-dead baby and implanting it into the chest of a 19-day-old infant who had a heart defect that would have been fatal. The recipient lived for a little more than six hours after the surgery. As part of Kantrowitz's research for this project, he conceived of ABO-incompatible heart transplantation, though it would be three decades before it would be put into practice.
The intra-aortic balloon pump was invented by Adrian Kantrowitz, working in conjunction with his brother, Arthur Kantrowitz. Inserted through the patient's thigh, it was directed into the aorta, and alternately expanded and contracted in order to reduce strain on the heart. Based on Kantrowitz's theory of "counterpulsation", the device inflated the balloon with helium gas when the heart relaxed and deflated it when the heart pumped blood. The pump did not require surgery and could be inserted using local anesthetic in an emergency room or at a patient's bedside. The device was first used in August 1967 to save the life of a 45-year-old woman who was having a heart attack. The device could be used in the 15% of heart attack patients who went into severe shock, 80% of whom could not be helped by the protocols that existed before the balloon pump. Since the device went into widespread use in the 1980s, it had been used in some three million patients by the time of his death.

He and his entire team of surgeons, researchers, biomedical engineers, and nurses relocated to Sinai Hospital (now Sinai-Grace Hospital) in Detroit in 1970, where he assumed the position of attending surgeon and Chairman of the Department of Surgery.
At Sinai Hospital, Kantrowitz experimented further with heart transplants and continued development of the balloon pump, and partial mechanical hearts. In August 1971, he implanted an artificial heart booster in a 63-year-old man whose weakened heart could not pump sufficient oxygenated blood to his body. The patient became the first partial mechanical heart patient to be sent home, and died three months after the surgery.
Personal.
Kantrowitz married Jean Rosensaft on November 25, 1948. His wife was an administrator on the surgical research laboratories at Maimonides Medical Center while he was there. In 1983, they co-founded L.VAD Technology, Inc., a company specializing in research and development of cardiovascular devices, with Dr. Kantrowitz as president and his wife as vice president.
Kantrowitz died at age 90 in Ann Arbor, Michigan on November 14, 2008 of heart failure.

Geography.
Kirk Smeaton and its sister village Little Smeaton face each other across the River Went, the most southerly boundary of the Celtic Kingdom of Elmet. A footbridge links the two, providing both villages with walks to Brockadale [http://www.brockadale.org.uk/Home.html] and Wentbridge.
The Doncaster / North Yorkshire boundary lies close to the south of the village, and to the east it begins to follow the River Went all the way to the River Don. A railway from the Leeds - Doncaster line past Drax Power Station used to run close to the south of the village, with a railway station that opened in 1885 and part of the Hull and Barnsley Railway. The station was closed to passengers in 1932, and closed completely in 1959.

<doc id="19134028" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19134028" title="Kuala Sanglang">
Kuala Sanglang

Kuala Sanglang is a small coastal village town at the border of the northern Malaysian states of Perlis and Kedah. It was founded by Penghulu Said bin Jaafar bin Enjang (1860-1960) circa 1900, when he opened up an early settlement on the Kedah side of the border.
Penghulu Said is a Punghulu (a sort of village or county chief) of Mukim Sanglang in 1900 until the Japanese occupation of Malaya.In Kampung Masjid, where the descendants of his followers settled, he donated two pieces of land; one for the mosque and the other for a Muslim cemetery. The rest of the land was used for housing.
Penghulu Said's Origin and Family.
Penghulu Said's grandfather Enjang was probably from Perak as the name Enjang signifies a Perakian origin. While Jaafar was a seaman in Penang who later migrated to Kampung Sanglang where he got married and had 6 children. Penghulu Said was the eldest among his siblings, and he was later appointed as Panglima(a bodyguard and head of the local militia) to the Penghulu before being appointed as Penghulu himself, under the Sultan of Kedah.
Penghulu Said's military service.
His military service was fighting in Penang during the War of Che Nyoya and arresting the infamous bandit Salleh Tui in Kampung Sanglang.
His nephews who became Penghulu and Panglima were Penghulu Saari and Panglima Chin.
Origin of Name Kuala Sanglang.
Kuala is essentially an estuary where a river meets the sea. According to Penghulu Said, the origin of the word Sanglang is Sarang Helang which means "eagle nest". These nests ware said to be found along the coast and estuary of the area. Thus Kuala Sarang Helang is the original name, before later becoming Sanglang. 
Economy.
The main economic activity in Kuala Sanglang is fishing. However in the past, when the sea and rivers were the primary means of transportation, Kuala Sanglang played a major role as a port as well as a trade centre. With the hinterland planted with rice, rice processing too become an important industry. With the development of roads, Kuala Sanglang declined as a port and transport centre, but the recent activity of rearing prawns has become an important industry besides traditional fishing.

John Theodore of Bavaria

John Theodore of Bavaria (3 September 1703 – 27 January 1763), a son of Elector Maximilian II Emanuel of Bavaria and Teresa Kunegunda Sobieska, and a grandson of King John III Sobieski of Poland. In 1743, John Theodore was a cardinal, prince-bishop of Liège from 1744 until 1763, and also prince-bishop of Freising and Regensburg.
Early life.
Theodore was educated at the University of Ingolstadt in Bavaria and the University of Siena. He was elected bishop of Regensburg on 29 July 1721, at age 17. A little more than four months later, he was elected bishop of Freising, on 5 November 1723.
Even though Theodore was already a bishop-elect, he wasn't ordained as a priest until 9 April 1730.
Cardinalate.
Theodore was created a Cardinal-Priest of "San Lorenzo in Panisperna" on 9 September 1743 by Pope Benedict XIV. He did not participate in the conclave of 1758 following the death of Benedict. He was the last representative of the Wittelsbach family to occupy the bishopric of Liège. In March 1761, shortly after the death of his elder brother Clemens August, Pope Clement XIII rejected his succession as Archbishop and Prince-Elector of Cologne because the pope entertained some doubt as to Theodore's moral conduct.
Theodore was known as a great hunter, patron of music (he played the violincello) and theatre, and held a splendid court at Liège. He was said to have had affairs with several women despite his clerical status and was liked by the inhabitants of the bishopric. Asthmatic and tubercular, he gave into the advice of his doctor, a physician named Steppler (a German from Munich), who pretended that his sickness originated from coal vapours. He thus went for regular stays in Germany, though this did not improve his health.
Death.
Theodore died on 27 January 1763, in Liège, Belgium. He was buried in Saint-Lambert Cathedral in Liège while his heart was buried in Grace Chapel, Altötting.

No-Cal Soda

No-Cal was the first zero-calorie soda.
History.
Hyman Kirsch and his son Morris, both Russian immigrants living in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York, began selling sodas in 1904. Their involvement with the Jewish Sanitarium for Chronic Disease (now known as Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center), led them to the invention of a sugar-free drink to meet the needs of the hospital’s diabetic patients.
Hyman and Morris developed a line of carbonated, sugar-free, zero-calorie soft drinks which they called No-Cal, that they began selling in 1952. The soda was produced at the company’s plant in College Point, Queens, New York.
Advertising.
No-Cal used up-and-coming Hollywood starlets such as Kim Novak and Julie Adams in their print ads. Cartoonist Stan Goldberg did the advertising art for a No-Cal Soda billboard in Times Square.
Decline.
As major soda producers such as the Coca Cola Company and Pepsico launched their own diet brands in the 1960s, No-Cal found it hard to compete, lost market share, and slowly disappeared.

Bristol Palin

Bristol Sheeran Marie Palin (born October 18, 1990) is an American speaker and reality television personality. She is the oldest daughter and second of five children of Todd and Sarah Palin, the 9th Governor of Alaska and Republican candidate for Vice President during the 2008 Presidential Election.
Palin competed in the fall 2010 season of "Dancing with the Stars" and reached the finals, finishing in third place. In summer 2011, Palin released a best-selling memoir '. In summer 2012, she starred in the Lifetime show '. Her most recent television series was Palin as member of the fall 2012 all-star cast of "Dancing with the Stars"'s 15th season, where she was eliminated in the fourth week of competition.
Early life and education.
Palin was born and raised in Wasilla, Alaska. She was named "Bristol" after the Bristol Inn where her mother Sarah was employed; Bristol, Connecticut, the headquarters city of ESPN, where her mother Sarah hoped to work as a sportscaster; and the Bristol Bay area of Alaska, where her father Todd grew up.
Beginning in 2005, Palin attended Juneau-Douglas High School In 2008, she briefly lived in Anchorage with her aunt and uncle and attended West Anchorage High School. She returned to Wasilla, where she graduated from Wasilla High School in May 2009.
Career.
Teen pregnancy prevention spokesperson.
Palin first became the subject of media attention when her pregnancy was announced during her mother's unsuccessful run for Vice President. In February 2009, she told Fox News that abstinence is "not realistic at all," but that she would like it to become more accepted among people her age.
In May 2009, at age 18, Palin began working with The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, to inform young people about the negative consequences of teenage pregnancy. The campaign's spokesman said that working with Palin made sense, because "she's had the highest-profile teen pregnancy of the year." Palin said that her abstinence quote of February had been "taken out of context."
Also in May 2009, Palin was named a Teen Pregnancy Prevention Ambassador for the Candie’s Foundation, a teen pregnancy prevention organization that is a division of the Candie's clothing brand. Her duties as a paid spokeswoman involved attending town hall meetings, public service announcements, and giving interviews on morning talk shows.
In May 2009, on "Good Morning America", Palin said, "Regardless of what I did personally, abstinence is the only 100% foolproof way you can prevent pregnancy." In another interview on "Good Morning America" in April 2010, she said that "Pause Before You Play campaign of Candie's hits a wider range of message, it can mean pause and go get a condom, it can be pause and think about your life, or it could be pause and wait until marriage."
Her role as a spokesperson drew some public criticism. Bonnie Fuller, former editor-in-chief of "YM", questioned, shortly after Palin became a spokesperson, whether the net effect of Palin's presentations has glamorized rather than discouraged teen pregnancy, noting that the "picture perfect" imagery of a "People" magazine spread seemed to make her "the poster girl for teen momhood." That same month, Meghan McCain stated her support for sex education and criticized Palin's sexual abstinence campaign, saying it was "not realistic for this generation."
In November 2010, former MSNBC commentator Keith Olbermann declared Palin his "Worst Person in the World" for her advocacy, to which Palin replied "Accusing me of hypocrisy is by now, an old canard... Parents warn their children about the mistakes they made so they are not repeated. Former gang members travel to schools to educate teenagers about the risks of gang life. Recovered addicts lecture to others about the risks of alcohol and drug abuse. And yes, a teen mother talks about the benefits of preventing teen pregnancy."
In April 2011 it was reported that Palin was paid more than $262,000 by Candie's Foundation for her work in 2009. This level of compensation, which constituted 12 percent of the foundation's annual budget, was criticized by some commentators as excessive.
In a July 2011 interview with Drew Pinsky, Palin said she doesn’t want to "be named as an abstinence preacher ... I’m not out there saying don’t have sex. I hate that kind of stuff. Birth control needs to be used effectively each and every single time if you’re gonna be having sex. ... I’m not advocating for everyone else."
Business venture.
In September 2009, Palin formed BSMP, a lobbying, public relations and political consulting services firm. While the initial focus was to be working with Candie's Foundation, BSMP planned to work with additional clients.
Paid speeches.
In May 2010 it was reported that Palin had signed with the company Single Source Speakers, asking between $15,000 and $30,000 for each appearance. She was listed on the company's website as available for conferences, fundraisers, special events and holidays, as well as women's, youth, abstinence, and pro-life programs.
In January 2011, Palin was invited to speak at Sexual Responsibility Week at Washington University in St. Louis, but students protested the high fee she was to be paid out of student-generated funds. Her appearance was cancelled.
Television.
"The Secret Life of the American Teenager".
Palin appeared in an episode of the ABC Family network series, "The Secret Life of the American Teenager", playing a friend of the fictional character Amy, a 15-year-old who is dealing with an unexpected pregnancy. She filmed the scenes in Los Angeles in March 2010; the episode aired on July 5, 2010. "I like doing speaking engagements and stuff like that," she told "E!". "I don't think I'll be doing any more acting in the future."
"Dancing with the Stars", season 11.
Palin was a competitor on the fall 2010 season of "Dancing with the Stars" (DWTS). She was partnered with professional Mark Ballas, a two-time champion on the show who won with Olympic figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi in season 6, and with Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson in season 8. The show was televised from September through November 2010.
Despite getting the lowest scores from the judges for a number of weeks, Palin and Ballas avoided being eliminated during the season. That attracted media attention and speculation. Questions were raised about the integrity of the public voting process including allegations of fraudulent online voting using multiple e-mail addresses. Executives at ABC and the show's executive producer, Conrad Green, stated that "checks and balances" in the system, including IP address verification, prevent such voting practices, and that "here's nothing in the voting that looks dissimilar to previous seasons." Nonetheless, Green speculated that Palin may have received votes from her mother's fans and other supporters, and from older viewers who had maternal feelings toward her due to her youth and lack of prior experience. Palin credited her success to the support of her fans who were tuning in each week to see her improvement.
Palin's success on the show attracted other negative attention, including death threats against her. In one instance, suspicious white powder was received by the show. The powder turned out to be harmless, but security on the show was tightened.
On the final show of the season, Palin and Ballas finished in third place. Prior to that show, Palin said that winning "would be like a big middle finger out there to all the people out there who hate my mom and hate me." Following the competition, she remarked that she was happy with her third place finish, that prayer and faith had helped her, and that she had grown as a person.
"Sarah Palin's Alaska".
In November 2010, Bristol Palin made an appearance on the TLC travelogue/documentary "Sarah Palin's Alaska", helping on a commercial halibut fishing boat.
"Bristol Palin: Life's a Tripp".
Palin's docu-series "Life's A Tripp", produced by Associated Television International, premiered on June 19, 2012, in the United States, on Lifetime TV. Lifetime ordered 14 episodes for original broadcast. The series followed Palin as she moved to Los Angeles, then back to Alaska, with two episodes set in Arizona (where her sister Willow was attending beauty school) and one episode in Washington, D.C.
"Dancing with the Stars", season 15.
Palin competed on the all-star season 15 of "DWTS", which began in late September 2012. She was again partnered with Mark Ballas. The two were eliminated in week 4 of the season, in which they had the second-lowest score from the judges.
Music video.
In October 2010, while competing on "Dancing With the Stars" season 11, Palin appeared in a music video for an Alaskan symphony rock band, Static Cycle. The video was shot at the Ice Museum in Chena Hot Springs, Alaska, with Palin dressed in a fur hat and coat, playing a mother-nature-type role of melting the ice.
Memoir.
In June 2011, Palin's memoir, "Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far", co-authored by Nancy French, was released. In the book, Palin candidly discusses aspects of her personal life, including tensions with the McCain family and losing her virginity. The book received mixed reviews from critics and readers. It was a New York Times bestseller.
Personal life.
2008 Republican National Convention and pregnancy announcement.
When Sarah Palin was chosen as John McCain's vice presidential running mate in late August 2008, his advisers already knew of Bristol's pregnancy, which they believed would be a political liability. On September 1, the opening day of the 2008 Republican National Convention, it was publicly announced that Palin was pregnant and engaged to Levi Johnston, the father of her child. Palin's entire family, along with Johnston, appeared at the convention. McCain's advisers reportedly thought a wedding between Johnston and Palin would boost the waning popularity of the McCain-Palin ticket. Johnston denied claims that he was being pressured into a shotgun wedding, stating, "We were planning on getting married a long time ago with or without the kid. That was the plan from the start."
Motherhood.
Palin and Johnston's son, Tripp Easton Mitchell Johnston, was born in December 2008. She denied claims that her mother's pro life views influenced her decision to give birth to and raise her son Tripp: "It doesn't matter what my mom's views are on it. It was my decision."
Palin and Johnston broke off their engagement in March 2009. In November 2009, a custody and child support case was filed in a local Alaska court. Palin asked the court to use pseudonyms for herself and Johnston to keep the normally public proceedings private, arguing that the media attention would not be good for the child. Johnston argued for open proceedings, saying he wanted the case to be decided on the merits, and that he did "not feel protected against Sarah Palin in a closed proceeding." In December 2009, on Tripp's first birthday, the judge ruled in favor of Johnston, and it was publicly announced that the pair had been battling for legal custody. Palin, who wished to win full custody rights and child support consistent with Johnston's income, stated that Johnston had "exercised sporadic visitation rights" and "wants the rights for his own self-promotion". Johnston sought shared custody and lower child support payments. In February 2010 a judge ruled that Johnston had to pay back child support, with a hearing set to determine the amount of ongoing support payments.
That month, Palin and her son began living in a condo she had purchased in Anchorage, where she was working at a dermatologist's office and taking business courses at a community college. In July 2010, Palin and Johnston announced that they had reunited and were again engaged, but less than three weeks later, they ended their second engagement.
In August 2010 she moved out of the condo and returned to her parents' home, and the couple reached an agreement giving primary custody to Palin and visitation rights and child support responsibility to Johnston. In December 2010, Palin purchased a five-bedroom house in Maricopa, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, for $172,000 in cash, according to Pinal County property records. The house was sold in May 2012 for $175,000 and Palin moved back to Alaska.

Cathedral of the Sacred Heart (Pueblo, Colorado)

Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Pueblo or Sacred Heart Church is a historic church building in Pueblo, Colorado.
History.
In October 1860, Fr. Projectus Machebeuf, and Fr. J.B. Raverdy began the 400-mile journey from Santa Fe, New Mexico, north into Colorado Territory. Months later they arrived at the Arkansas River, at the present site of the city of Pueblo. Initially the priests celebrated mass in the homes of local Catholics, then they began to hold public services in the old Courthouse on 3rd and Santa Fe Avenue, until finally a proper church was established on 13th and West Streets. In 1873 it was the first parish in Pueblo, and it was called St. Ignatius.
A fire destroyed St. Ignatius and its rectory in 1882. Under the direction of the Jesuit priests assigned to serve it, money was raised and second church was built. This time St. Ignatius was situated near the heart of the city, on Grand between 10th and 11th Streets.
Eventually it served as the parish hall when the present church was built under the pastorate of Msgr. Thomas Wolohan. In 1910, Msgr. Wolohan began planning for a new church to be dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. On May 5, 1912, the church cornerstone was laid, and within a year, Sacred Heart was dedicated by the Most Reverend Nicholas Matz, Archbishop of Denver.
The construction costs of the church was $48,000, and was realized with the help of the congregation of 190 families. Msgr. Wolohan served as pastor of Sacred Heart for thirty-six years. He is buried in a crypt in the cathedral.
On November 15, 1941, Sacred Heart was elevated to the status of a Cathedral with the establishment of the new Diocese of Pueblo. Since the establishment of Sacred Heart as a Cathedral, it has been served by eight rectors and administrators. In the past few years, the parish has grown from 930 families to well over 1,200. It truly has become a model of good liturgy and ministry for other parishes to emulate as the parish church of the Bishop.
In 1997, the Cathedral celebrated its 125th anniversary with a year long series of events. It adopted as its motto that year, Strong at Heart after 125 years.
In 1989, the Cathedral was added to the National Register of Historic Places by the U.S. Department of the Interior.[http://www.dioceseofpueblo.com/parishes/City/bccathedral.htm#Cathedralhistory]
In 2008, the steeple of the cathedral was stuck by lightning and was engulfed by flames and was damaged. Work is being done to replace the steeple and install a lightning rod. Work was completed by HW Houston Construction and Vision Mechanical and the new cross was dedicated.
The Current Bishop of the Cathedral is Fernando Isern.

Brugia timori

Brugia timori is a human filarial parasitic nematode (roundworm) which causes the disease "Timor filariasis." While this disease was first described in 1965, the identity of "Brugia timori" as the causative agent was not known until 1977. In that same year, "Anopheles barbirostris" was shown to be its primary vector.
Characteristics of "Brugia timori".
The microfilariae of "Brugia timori" are longer and morphologically distinct from those of "Brugia malayi" and "Wuchereria bancrofti", with a cephalic space length-to-width ratio of about 3:1. Also, the sheath of "B. timori" does not stain pink with Giemsa stain as is observed with "B. malayi" and "W. bancrofti".
"Brugia timori" filariasis.
Like other human filariasis infections, "Brugia timori" filariasis causes acute fever and chronic lymphedema. The life cycle of "Brugia timori" is very similar to that of "Wuchereria bancrofti" and "Brugia malayi", leading to nocturnal periodicity of the disease symptoms.
So far "Brugia timori" has only been found in the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia. It is locally confined to areas inhabited by its mosquito vector, which breeds in rice fields. One study of the prevalence of infection in Mainang village, Alor Island, found microfilariae in the blood of 157 of 586 individuals (27%), with 77 of them (13%) exhibiting lymphedema of the leg.
Treatment.
Anthelmintics such as diethylcarbamazine and albendazole have shown promise in the treatment of "Brugia timori" filariasis. Some researchers are confident that "Brugia timori" filariasis may be an eradicable disease.

Montana Stream Access Law

The Montana Stream Access Law says that anglers, floaters and other recreationists in Montana have full use of most natural waterways between the high-water marks for fishing and floating, along with swimming and other river or stream-related activities. In 1984, the Montana Supreme Court held that the streambed of any river or stream that has the capability to be used for recreation can be accessed by the public regardless of whether the river is navigable or who owns the streambed property.
Details of Stream Access.
The core law creating the Montana Streambed Access law began with Article IX, section 3 of the 1972 Montana Constitution, which addressed state ownership of Montana waters. In 1984 in "Montana Coalition for Stream Access, Inc. v. Curran," the Montana Supreme Court held that “under the public trust doctrine and the 1972 Montana Constitution, any surface waters that are capable of recreational use may be so used by the public without regard to streambed ownership or navigability for nonrecreational purposes.” This decision was expanded upon in the same year by "Mont. Coalition for Stream Access, Inc. v. Hildreth". Both cases noted that stream access did not imply that the public had a right to cross private lands to access streams. Following "Curran" and "Hildreth", the Montana Legislature enacted the Stream Access Law in 1985. An Attorney General's opinion added trapping to the list of permissible recreational uses.
Classification of waters.
The law creates two classifications of waters capable of recreational use: Class I and Class II. Class I are waters which are capable of recreational use and have been declared navigable or which are capable of specific kinds of commercial activity including commercial outfitting with multi-person watercraft. Class II waters are all other rivers and streams capbable of recreational use that are not Class I waters.

Sarah's storylines have included a controversial and ground-breaking underage pregnancy, which saw her giving birth to her daughter Bethany and saw Sarah deal with motherhood in her teens, her relationships with Todd (Bruno Langley) and Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) and her sibling rivalry between her and her half-brother David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd).
Storylines.
Sarah was born prematurely, the daughter of Brian Tilsley (Christopher Quinten) and Gail Tilsley (Helen Worth). Questions are raised about whether Brian is Sarah's father, due to Gail's affair with Brian's cousin, Ian Latimer (Michael Loney). Brian rejects Sarah, thinking she is not his daughter until a blood-test reveals otherwise, but it still takes time for him to bond with Sarah. Brian is murdered just two weeks after her second birthday, and Sarah is subsequently adopted by Gail's second husband Martin Platt (Sean Wilson) who raises Sarah.
In February 2000, just after her 13th birthday, Sarah discovers she is five months pregnant. Her baby daughter Bethany is born four months later. The father, Neil Fearns (Paul Holowaty), has no interest in Bethany but when Neil dies in a car crash in September 2003, Sarah takes Bethany to his funeral and makes friends with his mother, Brenda Fearns (Julia Deakin). This nearly leads to Bethany's death, when Brenda tries to commit suicide with Bethany, fearing that Bethany is being raised in a house of sin; Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire), however, finds them and stops Brenda before harm is done.
During autumn 2002, Sarah becomes rebellious, splitting with her boyfriend Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) and moving on to a mischievous romance with troublemaker, Aiden Critchley, who introduces her joyriding and crashes the car, leaving Sarah with severe head injuries. She survives and dumps Aiden, disgusted that he had left her for dead in the wreckage. Sarah reconciles with Todd in early 2003 and they move into the flat over the bookies, causing problems between Gail and Sarah, particularly when Sarah tells her that she is pregnant again, aged 16. She is unsure about having the baby but Todd convinces her to go ahead with the pregnancy and they get engaged, despite their families' disapproval. However, Sarah is unaware that Todd is struggling with his emerging homosexual feelings and begins a secret fling with nurse Karl Foster (Chris Finch). When Sarah finds out, she dumps him and suffers a placental abruption shortly afterwards. She has to have an emergency caesarean and her baby son, Billy, dies soon after birth. Sarah blames Todd and refuses to allow him to attend their son's funeral but Todd ignores her and goes regardless.
Sarah dates Asian skip man, Scooter Makuna (Sushil Chudasama), briefly in 2005 before embarking on a more serious relationship with Todd's brother, Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), destroying his relationship with Violet Wilson (Jenny Platt). Sarah and Jason get engaged in March 2006, but once again, their families oppose the marriage. Jason gets cold feet on their wedding day and jilts her at the altar; it takes Sarah time to forgive him but they eventually reconcile and the wedding is re-organized. 
Sarah's relationship with her brother David is strained in 2007, when Bethany takes an ecstasy pill that David had hidden in one of her dolls, and nearly dies. David and Sarah continue to bicker continuously up until Sarah's wedding day, when he attempts to kill himself. The police interrupt the ceremony to inform the Platts of the attempted suicide; Sarah marries Jason regardless. Shortly after, Sarah's uncle Stephen Reid (Todd Boyce) visits and offers David a job in Milan. Jealous, Sarah sabotages this by planting drugs on him so Stephen withdraws the offer and offers it to Sarah instead. She accepts, and on 30 December 2007, she, Jason and Bethany leave for the airport to fly to Milan. However, at Manchester Piccadilly, Sarah tells Jason that she planted the drugs on David. Disgusted, he walks away, leaving Sarah to fly to Milan alone with Bethany.
Creation and development.
Casting.
She was played by Lynsay King from 1987 to 1999. Lynsay's twin sister Leah, who died of cot death in 1987, alternated in the role of Sarah with Lynsay for a brief period until her death. Tina O'Brien was recast in the role in 1999. O'Brien was given the part when she was 16, playing the character who was still only 12 at the time. She left the role in 2007, but has said that she would consider returning to the role in the future.
Storyline development.
The characters' teenage-pregnancy storyline was created to highlight the risks of teenage pregnancy. However, the storyline has been a highly controversial and discussed storyline because of the possibility that it glamorised the idea. Despite this, it has been praised for its message. Actress Tina O'Brien has revealed that she was "naive" over the plot at the time of filming, oblivious that it would create much controversy. The storyline has been discussed in "Television and criticism" published by "Intellect Books", which talked about the character and the storyline's impact.
In late 2005, Sarah began dating Jason Grimshaw. they had an on off relationship and were due to marry in 2006. Speaking of the storyline Ryan Thomas said: "Jason was thinking about getting married in four years rather than four months. It was just a gesture, and that’s all he wanted it to be. He thought they would just get engaged and they didn’t have to get married for ages yet. It was more of a stepping stone for him. It has come round quickly for Jason, and he is sort of being pushed into it. He doesn’t want to lose Sarah so he is going along with it because he does actually love her." Asked if Jason would settle down Thomas also said: "He's had a bit of a past and he's a bit of a Jack The Lad around Charlie but on this occasion, for once, he's actually showing some grown-up qualities and, when faced with the prospect of losing Sarah, he chose to bite the bullet."There's no grey area with Jason because there's not that much grey matter! Everything's in black and white. It's either marry Sarah and keep her or don't marry Sarah and lose her forever." Speaking about if Jason will also be able to handle Bethany, Thomas said: "He certainly will – he pulls her to one side during the ceremony and makes her a pledge. He realises he can't have Sarah without Beth – they come as a package." The storyline resulted in Jason leaving Sarah and also resulted in Sarah leaving the street for a new life abroad with Beth. leaving Jason alone and upset.
Departure.
In April 2007, it was announced that Tina O'Brien had quit her role as Sarah. Speaking of her reason for her quitting O'Brien said: "This has been an extremely difficult decision to make. I love playing Sarah and have had an amazing seven-and-a-half years in "Coronation Street". But I feel that the time has come to see what else is out there for me as an actress". She also thanked the producers and the writers for giving her fantastic storylines during her stint on the show. She also revealed that she will miss everyone. Producer Steve Frost commented on her departure: "Tina is a fabulous actress and we will be sorry to see her go. However, we fully understand her ambition and desire to play other roles". O'Brien's final scenes aired in December 2007. In February 2011, O'Brien revealed that leaving "Coronation Street" was the right decision, she went on to say: "Leaving Corrie was the hardest decision I ever made, but it was the right one," she said. "I'm really glad I've had the opportunity to do different things. I still watch the show occasionally and get sucked in instantly".
Possible return.
In November 2011, the "Daily Star" revealed that "Coronation Street" producer Phil Collinson was planning on bringing back O'Brien and Nikki Sanderson who played Candice Stowe between 2000 and 2005 in a bid to fill the gap left by the departures of Helen Flanagan who played Rosie Webster and Katherine Kelly who played Becky McDonald. A source told the paper: "He's aware that Sarah-Lou and Candice were hugely popular characters. He thinks it would be a ratings winner to bring them back. Losing Katherine and Helen is a big blow to the show so Phil wants to beef things up a bit with the return of a couple of big names. O'Brien revealed in January 2012 that bosses had not approached her about a return to the soap. O'Brien has since revealed that she is worried that another actress might take over the role of Sarah. In December 2012, a reporter from "The Sunday Mirror" reported that O'Brien would reprise her role in 2013, but the actress later denied the report.
Reception.
For her portrayal of Sarah, O'Brien was nominated in the category of "Most Popular Newcomer" at the National Television Awards in 2000. She was nominated for"Best Actress" at the 2005 British Soap Awards.

MTRF1

Mitochondrial translational release factor 1, also known as MTRF1 is a human gene.
The protein encoded by this gene directs the termination of translation in response to the peptide chain termination codons. Initially thought to have a role in the termination of mitochondria protein synthesis. mtRF1 has been hypothesized to recognize non-standard stop codons AGA and AGG in vertebrates. Alternatively, based on detailed 3D modelling, it has been proposed to recognize stalled ribosomes in which a tRNA is still bound to the peptide chain, but in which the A-site of the ribosome is empty.

Bankers Securities Corporation (B.S.C.) was a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based investment company formed in 1927, by Albert M. Greenfield for general investment banking and trading in securities. It eventually became the parent company for virtually all of Greenfield's financial interests. B.S.C. bought control of Lit Brothers department store, then subsequently sold it to City Stores Company. On December 1, 1931, City Stores Company could no longer meet its financial obligation to B.S.C. and Greenfield took control of City Stores. Greenfield was now a retail magnate. B.S.C bought other stores outside the City Stores umbrella including: N. Snellenburg & Company; Bonwit Teller & Company; Tiffany & Co.; and Loft Candy Corporation. The Greenfield B.S.C. empire also included a number of Philadelphia based hotels including the Bellevue Stratford, Benjamin Franklin, Sylvania, Adelphia, Essex, John Bartram and the Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia and Atlantic City, New Jersey. Greenfield resigned as chairman of B.S.C. in March 1959, and was succeeded by Gustave G. Amsterdam.

Cheese pudding

Cheese pudding is a pudding made with cheese, which unlike cheesecake can be served at room temperature or frozen.
History.
A dish known as a cheese pudding was mentioned in "The Carolina Housewife" in 1874. However this was a savoury pudding which resembled a souffle. Another savoury dish adds cheese to a bread pudding. In 1934 the sweet version was mentioned as a new addition to menus. One version is considered a Latin dish and is intensely sweet.
One version involves boiling cottage cheese, paneer or goats cheese, (rather than a cheesecake, which is based on cream cheese) with a sugar syrup, then adding extra ingredients such as pistachios or soft fruits such as cherries or cranberries, and freezing. Unlike a cheesecake, it is frozen or served at room temperature rather than chilled. Paneer Kheer is an Indian cheese pudding, made with sugar and milk.
It is inexpensive and in the past was recommended to families wanting three meals a day for a week, for $3, if they ate this and as another meal, stewed tripe.

The President's Mistress

"The President's Mistress" is a 1978 American television film produced by Kings Road Entertainment featuring Beau Bridges, Susan Blanchard and Larry Hagman.
Plot.
Donna Morton has been having an affair with the President of the United States for several months, regularly meeting with him for assignations in a safe house in Washington, D.C.. She is always picked up in a car by a Secret Service agent.
In Moscow, an agent in the Kremlin manages to get hold of a secret document identifying Donna Morton as a KGB agent sent to spy on the president. This document is passed back to Washington where it comes into the possession of the CSA (a loosely-disguised version of the CIA). They begin to put Donna Morton under surveillance.
The same day, her brother Ben Morton - a Washington businessman and occasional courier for the CSA - arrived back in the city. On the plane he meets and romances Mugsy Evans. When Donna Morton suddenly turns up dead in her apartment moments before she was due to be picked up by her Secret Service driver, he begins to investigate.
He discovers her affair with the President, and through his contacts with the Secret Service, he discovers a CSA agent was seen leaving her apartment building around the time of his death. The Secret Service agent who regularly drove Donna, informs him that the CSA were there, but before any more information can be passed on he is killed.
Realising now that the CSA had played a large role in her death, Ben Morton confronts the head of the CSA who tells him it was the Soviets who killed her, and that she was a Soviet agent. He explains that the man who probably performed the deed was the head KGB agent in Washington, Anatoly.
Anatoly is the Soviet Naval Attaché who he interrogates at gunpoint in the car. He tells him everything he knows - that the classified document identifying Donna Morton as a Soviet agent was a fake, designed to throw the CSA off-balance, which had always been intended to fall into American hands. The KGB had thus hoped to destabilise the White House during crucial talks with China.

C9orf3

Chromosome 9 open reading frame 3 (C9ORF3) also known as aminopeptidase O (APO) is an enyzme which in humans is encoded by the "C9ORF3" gene. The protein encoded by this gene is an aminopeptidase which is most closely related in sequence to leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H). APO is a member of the M1 metalloproteinase family.
Structure.
The C9ORF3 aminopeptidase enzyme contains the following domains:
Function.
The C9ORF3 aminopeptidase cleaves the N-terminal amino acid from polypeptides and shows a strong preference for peptides in which the N-terminus is arginine and to a lesser extent asparagine. Furthermore the activity of the enzyme is inhibited by o-phenanthroline, a metalloprotease inhibitor and by arphamenine A, a potent inhibitor of aminopeptidases such as LTA4H. Also able to cleave angiotensin III to generate angiotensin IV, a bioactive peptide of the renin-angiotensin pathway.
Due to its aminopeptidase activity this enzyme may play a role in the proteolytic processing of bioactive peptides in those tissues where it is expressed.
Tissue distribution.
C9ORF3 Messenger RNA has been detected in human pancreas, placenta, liver, testis, and heart. The expression in the heart suggests this enzyme may also play a role in the regulating the physiology of cardiac muscle. Several ApO isoforms are expressed predominantly in blood vessels suggesting that ApO plays a role in vascular cell biology.
Clinical significance.
High expression levels of C9ORF3 is positively correlated with maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) and the amount of "slow-twitch" type 1 muscle fibers.

Glenmere Lake

Glenmere Lake is a colonial mill pond or reservoir located in Orange County, New York, USA. It is New York State's largest and virtually last habitat of the Northern Cricket Frog ("Acris crepitans"), listed as endangered by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The lake is threatened by both private and municipal development.
The lake is part of the greater Orange County-owned Glenmere Preserve, one of the largest wild areas in Orange County. Glenmere Lake is the most biologically diverse natural feature of Orange County, with hardwood swamp, shale ridgelines, wide marsh, mossy bogs, vernal pools and an open-water reservoir. Such biodiversity, present in New York’s fastest-growing county, underscores the critical nature of Glenmere’s unique habitat. The Glenmere Reservoir lands are home to Bald Eagles, six species of hawk and six of owl. Endangered plant and animal species inhabit the Glenmere lands- in fact, New York State’s largest and virtually last population of endangered Northern Cricket Frogs inhabits the entire parcel.
Glenmere straddles Orange County’s two largest Hudson River watershed basins: The Wallkill, on its western side, and the Moodna, on its east (Represented by its westernmost tributary, the Black Meadow creek) . The Glenmere Reservoir Lands include a "watershed ambiguous zone" where small brooks split off into either watershed. The lake and associated county lands comprise sections of the towns and villages of Warwick, Chester, Sugar Loaf and Florida.
The 1912 Glenmere mansion still overlooks the reservoir.
Studies of the lake and its associated periphery are performed by the educational non-profit Glenmere Conservation Coalition.
The state recently slapped Orange County, the Town of Chester and Village of Florida with a $350,000 penalty, finding they had blown off decades of warnings to keep the Glenmere Lake Dam in safe condition and had attempted repairs on the dam without obtaining permits.

Larive

Jean Mauduit, stage name Larive or de La Rive, was a French actor. He was born in La Rochelle on 6 August 1747 and died at Montlignon on 30 April 1827.
Life.
The son of a grocer, he left his father's home to devote himself to the theatre and presented himself to Lekain in Paris for a job. Engaged in Madame Montansier's company, he played at Tours, then at Lyon, and came back to Paris where Mademoiselle Clairon took him under her protection.
Larive made his debut at the Comédie-Française on 3 December 1770 but was not well received. He left for Brussels where D'Hannetaire engaged him for the lead rôles at the Théâtre de la Monnaie and where he spent 4 years, acting alongside Dazincourt, Grandmesnil and Florence. It was here that he got to known his future wife, Eugénie D'Hannetaire, the director's eldest daughter, who he married in Paris on 18 June 1776 (they divorced in 1794). He was a friend of Voltaire and interpreted many of his lead roles.
On 29 April 1775, Larive made another first appearance at the Comédie-Française and was admitted as a sociétaire on the following 18 May. Three years later, the death of Lekain put him in first place among the sociétaires. He regularly toured the provinces and appeared in his birthplace in 1780, as well as in Lille, Geneva and Bordeaux. He left the Comédie-Française in 1788 but returned to it in 1790, after appearing in Lille.
Supplanted by Talma, he was imprisoned several times during the French Revolution and retired to his property at Montlignon, becoming the town's mayor.
Works.

Chinese science fiction (traditional Chinese: 科學幻想, simplified Chinese: 科学幻想, pinyin: "kēxué huànxiǎng", commonly abbreviated to 科幻 kēhuàn, literally "scientific fantasy") is genre of literature that concerns itself with hypothetical future social and technological developments in the Sinosphere.
Mainland China.
Late-Qing Dynasty.
Science fiction in China was initially popularized through translations of Western authors during the late-Qing dynasty by proponents of Western-style modernization such as Liang Qichao and Kang Youwei as a tool to spur technological innovation and scientific progress.
With his translation of Jules Verne's "Fifteen Little Heroes" into Classical Chinese, Liang Qichao became one of the first and most influential advocates of science fiction in Chinese.
In 1903, Lu Xun，who later became famous for his darkly satirical essays and short stories, translated Jules Verne's "The Cannon Club" and "Journey to the Centre of the Earth" from Japanese into Classical Chinese (rendering it in the traditional "zhang wei ban" style and adding expository notes) while studying medicine at the Kobun Institute (弘文學院 "Kobun Gakuin") in Japan. He would continue to translate many of Verne's and H.G. Wells' classic stories, nationally popularizing these through periodical publication.
The earliest work of original science fiction in Chinese is believed to be the unfinished novel "Lunar Colony" (月球殖民地小說), published in 1904 by an unknown author under the pen name Old Fisherman of the Secluded River (荒江釣叟). The story concerns Long Menghua, who flees China with his wife after killing a government official who was harassing his wife's family. The ship they escape on is accidentally sunk and Long's wife disappears. However, Long is rescued by Otoro Tama, the Japanese inventor of a dirigible who helps him travel to Southeast Asia searching for his wife. They join with a group of anti-Qing martial artists to rescue her from bandits. Deciding that the nations of the world are too corrupt, they all travel to the moon and establish a new colony.
Republican Era.
Following the collapse of the Qing-dynasty in 1911, China went through a series of dramatic social and political changes which affected the genre of science fiction tremendously. Following the May Fourth Movement in 1919 vernacular Chinese began to replace Classical Chinese as the written language of the Chinese mainland in addition to Chinese-speaking communities around the world. China's earliest purely literary periodical, "Story Forest" (小說林), founded by Xu Nianci, not only published translated science fiction, but also original science fiction such as "New Conch Shell Mr. Tan" (新法螺先生譚). Meanwhile Lao She employed science fiction for the purpose of social criticism in his science fiction novel "Cat Country" (貓城記) which was also published during this time period.
People's Republic of China.
1949 - 1966.
Following the Chinese civil war (1945–49) and the establishment of the People's Republic of China on the Chinese mainland, works with an ethos of socialist realism inspired by Soviet science fiction became more common while others works were suppressed. Still, many original works were created during this time, particularly ones with "popular science" approach aim to popularize science among younger readers and promote the country's wonderful socialist future. Zheng Wenguang in particular is known as the ‘father of Chinese science fiction’ for his writings in during this period up until the beginning of Cultural Revolution (1966–76) when the printing of non-revolutionary literature was suspended.
1978 - 1983.
During the Cultural Revolution very little literature was printed and science fiction essentially disappeared in mainland China. However, following the March 1978 National Science Congress convened by the Central Committee and the State Council and its proclamation that "science's spring has come," a greater enthusiasm for popular science (and thus science fiction) followed, with the publication of the children’s novel Ye Yonglie's "Xiao Lingtong's Travels in the Future" (《小灵通漫游未来》) in the same year as the 1978 National Science Congress marked a revival of science fiction literature in China.
In 1979 the newly founded magazine "Scientific Literature" (《科学文艺》) began publishing translations and original science fiction and Zheng Wenguang again devoted himself to writing science fiction during this period. Tong Enzheng wrote "Death Ray on a Coral Island", which was later adapted into China's first science fiction movie. Other important writers from this time period include Liu Xingshi, Wang Xiaoda, and Hong Kong author Ni Kuang. In his monograph, Rudolf G. Wagner argues during this brief rebirth of science fiction in China scientists used the genre to symbolically describe the political and social standing to which the scientific community desired following its own rehabilitation.
This rehabiliation suffered a setback during the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign (1983-1984), when Biao Qian labelled science fiction as "spiritual pollution." This led to authors such as Ye Yonglie, Tong Enzheng, Liu Xingshi, and Xiao Jianheng being condemned for slander and the publication of science-fiction in mainland China once again being prohibited indefinitely.
1991 - Present.
In 1991 Yang Xiao, then the director of the magazine "Scientific Art and Literature" which had survived the ban on science fiction during the 1980s by changing their name to "Strange Tales" and publishing non-fiction works, decided to run a science fiction convention in Chengdu, Sichuan. Not only was this the first ever international science fiction convention to be held in mainland China, it was also the first international event to be hosted in since China the student protests of 1989. "Scientific Literature" changed its name to "Science Fiction World" (《科幻世界》) and by the mid-90s had reached a peak circulation of about 400,000. Authors who came to prominence during the 1990s include Liu Cixin, Han Song, Wang Jinkang, Xing He, Qian Lifang, and He Xi. In particular, Liu, Han and Wang became popularly known as the 'Three Generals of Chinese Sci-fi'.
Wang Jinkang is the most prolific of the three, having published over 50 short stories and 10 novels. While working as a chassis engineer for oil rigs, he began writing short stories as a way to entertain his son and teach him scientific concepts, a focus he has maintained throughout his writing career. In an article published in the Commercial Press's bi-monthly magazine on Chinese culture, "The World of Chinese", Echo Zhao (赵蕾) describes his writing as being prevaded with 'a sense of heroic morality' that avoids the 'grim finality' of an apocalyptic future, citing examples of clones with bumps on their fingers to distinguish them from non-clones and robots whose hearts explode when they desire life.
Liu Cixin's work has been especially well-received, with his "Three Bodies" (三体) trilogy selling over 500,000 copies in China (as of the end of 2012). The books, which describe an alien civilization that invades earth over a vast span of time, have drawn comparisons to the works of Arthur C. Clarke by fellow science fiction author Fei Dao while Echo Zhao describes Liu Cixin's writing as 'lush and imaginative' with a particular interest in military technology.
Han Song, a journalist, writes darkly satirical novels and short stories which lampoon modern social problems. His novel "" which describes a Chinese invasion and takeover of the United States, and his short story collection "Subway" which features alien abductions and cannibalism on a never-ending train ride, have been lauded for their sense of social justice. He has been quoted as saying, "“It’s not easy for foreigners to understand China and the Chinese. They need to develop a dialectical understanding, see all sides, just as we appreciate the ‘yin’ and the ‘yang.’ I hope to prevent tragedy in China, and in the world, with my writing. I don’t think humans have rid themselves of their innate evil. It’s just suppressed by technology. If there is a spark of chaos, the worst will happen. That goes for all people, whether Chinese or Western. We should keep thinking back to why terrible things have happened in history and not allow those things to happen again.”
Meanwhile in the area of film and television, works such as the science fiction comedy "Magic Cellphone" (魔幻手机) explored themes of time travel and advanced technology. On March 31, 2011, however the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT) issued guidelines that strongly discouraged television storylines including "fantasy, time-travel, random compilations of mythical stories, bizarre plots, absurd techniques, even propagating feudal superstitions, fatalism and reincarnation, ambiguous moral lessons, and a lack of positive thinking" indicting that in the near future science fiction shows will likely not be allowed to be aired on mainland Chinese television.
Taiwan.
Following the defeat of the Qing Dynasty in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the island of Taiwan came under the sovereign rule to the Empire of Japan who eventually instituted a policy of 'Japanization' that discouraged the use of Chinese languages and scripts in Taiwan. When the island was ceded to the Republic of China after the end of World War II in 1945 the majority of Japanese colonialists were repatriated to Japan and the KMT, the ruling party of the RoC, quickly established control of the island. This was to prove key to the survival of the RoC government, who were forced to move their capital to the island after their defeat by the communists in the Chinese Civil War. The KMT pursued a policy of rapid sinification which, in combination with an influx of mainland intellectuals, spurred the development of Chinese language literature in Taiwan and along with it, science fiction.
Taiwanese science fiction authors include Wu Mingyi (吳明益), Zhang Xiaofeng (張曉風), Zhang Ziguo (张系国), Huang Hai (黃海), Huang Fan (黃凡), Ye Yandou (葉言都), Lin Yaode (林燿德), Zhang Dachun (張大春), Su Yiping (蘇逸平), Hong Ling 洪凌, Ye Xuan (葉軒), Mo Handu (漠寒渡), Yu Wo (御我), and Mo Ren (莫仁).
Hong Kong.
In Chinese, Hong Kong’s best known science fiction author is the prolific Ni Kuang, creator of the Wisely (衛斯理) series. More recently, Chan Koonchung’s dystopian novel ‘’The Fat Years’’ about a near future mainland China has been compared to George Orwell’s ‘’1984’’ and Aldous Huxley’s A Brave New World.
Malaysia.
Zhang Cao (張草) is a Malaysian-Chinese science fiction author who has published several novels in Chinese.
English translations and academic studies.
Joel Martinsen, a translator who works for the website Danwei.org, has promoted Chinese science fiction in English for a number of years, both on his blog "Twelve Hours Later: Literature from the other side of the globe — Chinese SF, fantasy, and mainstream fiction" and also on various websites around the Internet, often posting under the username 'zhwj'. Along with Ken Liu and Eric Abrahamsen, Martinesen will be translating Liu Cixin's Three Bodies trilogy for China Educational Publications Import & Export Corporation Ltd (CEPIT), with print and digital editions of the first two novels due out in the first half of 2013 and the third in 2014. 
The second issue of the literary monthly "Chutzpah!" edited by Ou Ning contains a in-depth history of Chinese fiction compiled by Kun Kun entitled "Some of Us Are Looking at the Stars", and translations of Chinese science fiction authors Han Song, Fei Dao, Chen Qiufan, Yang Ping into English, in addition to translations of English-language science fiction authors such as William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Paolo Bagicalupi and Jeff Noon into Chinese.
In 2012, the Hong Kong journal "Renditions: A Chinese-English Translation Magazine" issued a special double issue ("Renditions" No. 77 & 78) with a focus on science fiction, including works from both the early 20th century and the early 21st century. In March 2013, the peer-reviewed journal "Science Fiction Studies" released a special issue on Chinese Science Fiction, edited by Yan Wu and Veronica Hollinger.

Tequila Express

The Tequila Express (or Tequila Train) is a Mexican regional train service that operates from Guadalajara, Jalisco, to the Tequila Herradura distillery at the San José del Refugio Hacienda in the municipality of Amatitán, Jalisco. Amatitán is approximately northwest of Guadalajara and southeast of the town of Tequila, Jalisco. The train service is so named because it features tequila tastings and transports its passengers through blue agave fields to the distillery in Amatitán and towards (but not into) the town of Tequila.
The service began operating in 1997, concurrent with the elimination of general passenger rail service by Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México. The service is operated by Ferromex, owner of the Guadalajara train station and the rail line on which the service runs, under contract with the chamber of commerce. Service operates on weekends, usually from Friday through Sunday with sporadic trips on Mondays. The excursion includes live mariachi music on board the train, a tour of the hacienda and distillery, as well as a dinner on the hacienda premises.
The train is quite popular especially during the "Encuentro Internacional del Mariachi y la Charrería" festival held in Guadalajara.

Thavung language

Thavưng, or Aheu, is a language spoken by the Phon Sung people in Laos and Thailand. There are thought to be some 1,770 speakers in Laos, largely concentrated in Khamkeut District. A further 750 speakers live in 3 villages of Song Dao District, Sakon Nakhon Province, Thailand, namely Ban Nongwaeng (in Pathum Wapi Subdistrict), Ban Nongjaroen, and Ban Nongmuang (Suwilai Premsirat 1996).
Thavung makes a four-way distinction between clear and breathy phonation combined with glottalized final consonants. This is very similar to the situation in the Pearic languages in which, however, the glottalization is in the vowel.[http://sealang.net/mk/vietic.htm]

Albert M. Greenfield

Albert Monroe Greenfield (August 4, 1887 – January 5, 1967) was a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based real estate, banking, retailing, hotel, and transportation industry leader. Over time, he became increasingly influential in the civic and philanthropic arenas, and in local and national politics.
Early life and business activities.
Greenfield was born Avrahm Gruenfeld in 1887 to trader Jacob Gruenfeld and wife Esther (née Serody) in Lozovata, a village in what is now south-central Ukraine. Emigrating to New York City in 1896, he and his family (with names anglicized) soon moved to Philadelphia, settling in South Philadelphia where Jacob Greenfield ran a general store and Albert and his siblings attended school. While the younger Greenfield excelled at his studies (eventually gaining admission to the prestigious Central High School), he left high school at age 15 to become a clerk for a prominent local real estate lawyer. In this position, Greenfield found his calling, as he rapidly gained interest in, and knowledge of, the real estate business. 
Just two years later, in May 1905, Greenfield opened his own real estate firm, Albert M. Greenfield & Co., at 218 South 4th Street, with $500 that his mother borrowed for him from her brother. The money was rapidly repaid, as Greenfield was earning $60,000 a year by age 23; by 1917, his personal wealth had increased to $15 million. The alliances created through his growing real estate business led to investments in motion picture theaters, building and loan associations, and mortgage financing.
By the early 1920s he controlled 27 building and loan associations. In 1924, Greenfield and his father-in-law Sol C. Kraus formed Bankers Bond & Mortgage Company to handle first mortgages on real estate in Philadelphia. After expanding to the New York City market, the firm was renamed Bankers Bond & Mortgage Company of America. From 1925, until its closing on December 22, 1930 as a result of the crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression, he ran the Bankers Trust Company of Philadelphia. In 1927, Greenfield formed the Bankers Securities Corporation (BSC) for general investment banking and trading in securities, serving as its chairman until March 1959. It eventually became the parent company for virtually all of Greenfield's financial interests, including City Stores Company.
In common with many investors during the Depression, Greenfield was financially wiped out. Worse was to come; after Bankers Trust went under, he took another hit when City Stores was declared insolvent in 1931. However, after Greenfield himself took over the chairmanship of City Stores upon bankruptcy, CSCo realized a profit of $32 million in his first year at its helm, and he never looked back as the company expanded throughout the East Coast over the next 20 years, earning profits in the hundreds of millions of dollars. When asked much later about his negative experiences during the Depression, Greenfield replied, "It wasn't too bad. I've always treated both success and failure as imposters. I like making money, but I can get along without it. I never worried about having it because I knew I could always make more."
Board memberships.
Greenfield's reputation for producing results placed him in high demand. He was involved or interested in almost everything, becoming known in his time as "Mr. Philadelphia". At one point in the 1940s, he sat on forty-three boards. A few significant ones included the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company and successor Philadelphia Transportation Company (predecessors of SEPTA), Girard College, the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, the Urban Land Institute, the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the American Jewish Tercentenary Committee, the Sesquicentennial Exposition, Albert Einstein Medical Center, and the Federation of Jewish Charities.
Greenfield was also greatly involved in educational endeavors. He served as a trustee of Lincoln University, Temple University, Delaware Valley College of Science and Agriculture, Pennsylvania Military College, the American Heritage Foundation and the Kennedy and Truman Presidential Libraries.
Politics.
In 1917, Greenfield was elected to a seat on the Philadelphia Common Council and served until 1920. Originally a Republican, he switched parties with the advent of the New Deal and remained a strong Democratic supporter until his death. He enjoyed a close relationship with many Presidents from Herbert Hoover to Lyndon Johnson. Greenfield served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1928 and to the Democratic National Conventions from 1948-1964. He was also a presidential elector in 1956 and 1960. Through his political connections he received appointments to various committees and commissions. These included appointment by Philadelphia Mayor Richardson Dilworth in 1956 as Chairman of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission. In order to accept the position, Greenfield had to retire from his real estate business, stepping down on January 1, 1956 after fifty years as head of Albert M. Greenfield & Co. He became a strong advocate of urban renewal. Although on the commission for only a little over a year, his work laid the foundation for the development of Penn Center, Society Hill, the Independence Square area surrounding Independence Hall, and Veterans Stadium. Also because of his political activism, in 1948 Philadelphia hosted both the Republican and the Democratic party conventions.
Philanthropy and legacy.
In the early 1950s, Greenfield donated $1 million to the University of Pennsylvania for development of a human relations center. The center was named in his honor, The Albert M. Greenfield Center for Human Relations. It was established to offer graduate and undergraduate instruction on intergroup relations, to advance knowledge in the field of group relations by fostering both basic and applied research, and to provide community service. The Center existed through the late 1960s.
In 1953, he established The Albert M. Greenfield Foundation to provide grants to a variety of local Philadelphia institutions. The Foundation has supported the Albert Monroe Greenfield Memorial Lecture in Human Relations, an annual event at the University of Pennsylvania held under the terms of the endowment of the Greenfield Professorship of Human Relations. The professorship was established in 1972. In 1992, the Foundation endowed The Albert M. Greenfield Student Competition, The Philadelphia Orchestra, to recognize extraordinary young musical talent in the Greater Delaware Valley region. The Foundation has also funded the Albert M. Greenfield Digital Imaging Center at The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, the Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and the digital and print Albert M. Greenfield Center for 20th-Century History at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. 
His philanthropic endeavors transcended religious and racial lines. He was praised for his work by such organizations as the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the World Brotherhood Organization, the Urban League, and the Catholic Interracial Council. For his philanthropic work, he was bestowed with the rank of Commander of the Order of Pius IX by Pope Pius XI. He was the first Jew in America to receive such an honor.
The Albert M. Greenfield Elementary School (part of the School District of Philadelphia), located at 22nd and Chestnut Streets, Philadelphia, is named in his honor.
Greenfield died on January 5, 1967 at his estate, "Sugar Loaf", in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia. He was survived by his third wife, the former Elizabeth Hallstrom, as well as five children (two sons and three daughters) from his first marriage, 21 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. The Sugar Loaf estate remained in the hands of the Greenfield Foundation as their headquarters, and as the Albert M. Greenfield Conference Center of Temple University, until 2006 when the entire property was sold for $11 million to Chestnut Hill College.

Libertarian perspectives on revolution

Libertarian perspectives on revolution include the disparate views held by various libertarians on the desirability of creating fundamental change in power or organizational structures in a relatively short time. Libertarian revolutionary goals often include dissolution of current states, creation of new states on the ocean (seasteading) and even the abolition of all states.
Perspectives.
Murray Rothbard, after noting that convincing the ruling groups, and the recipients of their largesse, of their own iniquity would be almost impossible in practice, opines:
Samuel Edward Konkin III, who founded agorism, and Wally Conger wrote:
The Libertarian Party, U.S. platform quotes the U.S. Declaration of Independence in the “Self-determination” plank of its platform: "Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of individual liberty, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to agree to such new governance as to them shall seem most likely to protect their liberty."
Lew Rockwell states that libertarianism is a revolutionary movement and raises the example of the American Revolution, asking, "who writing about politics today might have joined the founding fathers in their conspiracy to overthrow imperial rule? The question is an important one because this event, more than any other in our history, embodies the core of the American political idea, that men are entitled to liberty from despots. This idea, the founders believed, ought to be acted upon by real people against really existing governments."
Author Pierre Lemieux writes: "Could we say that the more powerless the tyrant, the less likely it is that the revolution will devolve into the destruction of all social authorities? If so, it would mean that a libertarian revolution now would be much less dangerous than a revolution when tyranny has become unbearable. Better to make the revolution when it does not have to be devastating; better to do it sooner than later."
Professor Bruce L. Benson writes about the interaction of rebellion and state power: "Unfortunately, once an economy becomes strong, the opportunity costs of rebellion and other efforts to constrain the state become higher and the temptations to use the state as an internal wealth transfer mechanism get stronger, so resistance to the state can decline. When that happens, the state grows faster, and the economy can collapse under its weight unless the state is rolled back (New Zealand is a recent example that comes to mind)."
Methods.
Nonviolent action and non-cooperation.
"The Voluntaryist", a publication founded in 1982, promotes a libertarian form of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience they call voluntaryism. Its statement of purpose reads: “Voluntaryists are advocates of non-political, non-violent strategies to achieve a free society. We reject electoral politics, in theory and in practice, as incompatible with libertarian principles. Governments must cloak their actions in an aura of moral legitimacy in order to sustain their power, and political methods invariably strengthen that legitimacy. Voluntaryists seek instead to delegitimize the State through education, and we advocate withdrawal of the cooperation and tacit consent on which State power ultimately depends.”
Otto Guevara of Movimiento Libertario told "Reason" that the "revolutionaries of the 60s and 70s were all socialists. Now the natural impulse of youth to rebel is being channeled against the socialist establishment." He used as examples young people engaging in acts of "self-ownership" like tattooing and piercing, sexual liberty, the freedom to use drugs, as these are all areas where our position is appealing to the young. He described supporting one form of rebellion: "a huge, subterranean informal economy that's opposed by the larger, established companies...'el diputado pirata.' Someone wants to import and sell a used car... we said, 'what's the problem?' Used clothing, used shoes, these are big markets, and we thought it was absurd that there should be legal obstacles to people trading in these things."
John T. Kennedy promoted the libertarian/anarchist technique economic secession, for example, replacing use of fiat money with barter or commodity money, refusing to submit to government regulations and licensing and avoiding taxation. Sam Konkin created the similar term counter-economics. Survivalist-libertarian author Claire Wolfe writes about economic and political freedom and withdrawing from state control in her Backwoods Home Magazine column and her books, starting with "101 Things to Do 'Til the Revolution: Ideas and Resources for Self-Liberation, Monkey Wrenching and Preparedness."
In the novel The Diamond Age, speculative fiction author Neal Stephenson imagines a sudden fall of nation-states brought about by a rapid rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies similar to Bitcoin. Governments are unable to track transactions and income in this scenario and collapse when faced with severely reduced revenues.
Libertarians support the right of individuals, communities, states and regions to secede from larger entities. Libertarian professor Walter Block writes: "Those who are not free to secede are in effect (partial) slaves to a king, or to a tyrannous majority under democracy. Nor is secession to be confused with the mere right to emigrate, even when one is allowed to take one’s property out of the country. Secession means the right to stay put, on one’s own property, and either to shift alliance to another political entity, or to set up shop as a sovereign on one’s own account."
Many anarcho-capitalists of the Free State Project support non-violent revolution.
Violent rebellion or terrorism.
"Reason" senior editor Brian Doherty observes in "Radicals for Capitalism" that "libertarians have always been more likely to head to a bookstore than an armory, which some think is half the problem."
In "The Ethics of Liberty", Murray Rothbard notes: "To say that someone has the absolute right to a certain property but lacks the right to defend it against attack or invasion is also to say that he does not have total right to that property." However, Rothbard warns against harming innocents: "…the libertarian goal, the victory of liberty, justifies the speediest possible means towards reaching the goal, but those means cannot be such as to contradict, and thereby undercut, the goal itself. We have already seen that gradualism-in-theory is such a contradictory means. Another contradictory means would be to commit aggression (e.g., murder or theft) against persons or just property in order to reach the libertarian goal of nonaggression."
Rothbard's "For a New Liberty" cites the revolutionary war of the Bengali public against the Punjabi occupying state as being the recent conflict that comes closest to satisfying his criteria for a just war – namely, that it avoids injuring civilians in their persons or property; and uses volunteer rather than conscript armies; and is financed by voluntary methods instead of taxation. In response to Rothbard's rebuttal of the New Libertarian Manifesto, Konkin writes, "Rothbard’s statement that violent revolution (what other kind is there against a ruling class — would he like to mention an Establishment that stepped down peacefully?) never succeeded in history distorts either the language or history," and cites many examples of freedom-fighters throwing off oppressive democratic governments. But Konkin also spoke out against initiating violence against the State in his "New Libertarian Manifesto", as mentioned below.
The "Libertarian Forum" newsletter that Rothbard edited frequently addressed issues related to revolution. Rothbard condemned, on several occasions, "going over into armed struggle" on tactical even if not on moral grounds.
In 1996, Claire Wolfe wrote in her "101 Things to Do 'Til the Revolution": "America is at that awkward stage. It's too late to work within the system, but too early to shoot the bastards." But in her more recent 2003 book, "I Am Not A Number: Freeing America from the ID State", she recommended to readers the writings of nonviolent resistance theorist Gene Sharp.
Libertarian and crypto-anarchist Jim Bell invented the concept of an assassination market, a prediction market or dead pool where any party can place a bet on the date of death of a given individual, and collect a payoff if they "guess" the date accurately. After he was found in possession of various allegedly suspicious materials and weapons, and after placing a “stink bomb” in an Internal Revenue Service office, he was prosecuted and convicted of two felonies, for which he served eleven months in prison.
Opposition to violence.
David D. Friedman argues in "The Machinery of Freedom" that "civil disorder leads to more government, not less. It may topple one government, but it creates a situation in which people desire another and stronger. Hitler's regime followed the chaos of the Weimar years. Russian communism is a second example, a lesson for which the anarchists of Kronstadt paid dear. Napoleon is a third."
In "The Market for Liberty", Linda and Morris Tannehill argue that "not only is violent revolutionary action destructive, it actually strengthens the government by giving it a 'common enemy' to unite the people against. Violence against the government by a minority always gives the politicians an excuse to increase repressive measures in the name of 'protecting the people.' In fact, the general populace usually join the politicians' cry for 'law and order.'"
The Tannehills fear the tendency of revolutionary leaders to seize power: "…revolution is a very questionable way to arrive at a society without rulers, since a successful revolution must have leaders. To be successful, revolutionary action must be coordinated. To be coordinated, it must have someone in charge. And, once the revolution has succeeded, the 'Someone in Charge' (or one of his lieutenants, or even one of his enemies) takes over the new power structure so conveniently built up by the revolution. He may just want to 'get things going right,' but he ends up being another ruler. Something like this happened to the American Revolution, and look at us today."
Libertarian and anarcho-capitalist professor Bryan Caplan argues that "when terrorism succeeds in destroying an existing government, it merely creates a power vacuum without fundamentally changing anyone's mind about the nature of power. The predictable result is that a new state, worse than its predecessor, will swiftly appear to fill the void."
Samuel Edward Konkin III wrote, in "The New Libertarian Manifesto": "Heed well, you who would be a paladin of Liberty: never initiate any act of violence regardless how likely a 'libertarian' result may appear. To do so is to reduce yourself to a statist. There are no exceptions to this rule. Either you are fundamentally consistent or not.
Robert LeFevre based his view of libertarian theory on aggression itself being inherently statist, and opposed both retaliatory and initiatory violence. He wrote, "We must concern ourselves with the moral recognition that we must not join the ranks of the aggressors, even for what may appear to be cause. Governments, by their nature, are invariably agencies of aggression [...] But to the degree that we rely on government, which is our agency of aggression, to this degree do we reject civilization. If we can learn to recognize the merit of non-aggression, and hence of voluntary action, we will begin to employ the market place to a fuller degree and ultimately we may be able to abandon government reliance totally"
Seasteading.
Seasteading is the movement towards creating independent ocean colonies in international waters, outside the jurisdiction of current states. A high barrier of entry (building an artificial island or buying a sufficiently large ship), high upkeep costs, and the difficulty of securing supplies from the mainland, have so far prevented the successful creation of such colonies.

Nicholas Thompson (golfer)

Nicholas Thompson (born December 25, 1982) is an American professional golfer who has played on the PGA Tour and the Web.com Tour.
Thompson was born in Plantation, Florida. He graduated from Georgia Tech in 2005 with a degree in business management and was a member of the 2002 ACC championship team. He turned professional after graduating.
Thompson won his PGA Tour card for 2006 by finishing third in the 2005 qualifying school. He made only 15 of 32 cuts, with one top 10 finish in 2006 and lost his tour card when he finished 180th on the money list. In 2007, he played on the Nationwide Tour, winning once, the HSBC New Zealand PGA Championship, and finishing sixth on the money list, thus earning his PGA Tour card for 2008. He recorded 6 top-10 finishes in the 2008 season, including a tie for seventh at The Barclays, which was the first tournament in the 2008 FedEx Cup. With the tie for seventh he jumped to 20th in the FedEx Cup Standings - he eventually finished 41st. Later in the season, he cashed his largest paycheck when he earned $276,000 for finishing in a tie for 2nd at the Ginn sur Mer Classic, a Fall Series event, behind Ryan Palmer. He has now earned over three million dollars since turning professional in 2005. 
After his successful 2008, Thompson has struggled more on the PGA Tour. In 2009, he recorded only one top-10 finish, at the Frys.com Open, and kept his Tour card by just two places on the final money list. To date, he has again had just one top-10 in 2010, at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans.
Family.
His sister, Alexis, was the youngest player to ever play in the U.S. Women's Open, when she played in 2007. Nicholas helped her in practice rounds before going to that week's Nationwide Tour event.

Charles D. McAtee

Charles D. McAtee (July 8, 1928 – April 8, 2005) was a Marine Corps officer, FBI agent, director of Kansas prisons, attorney, and Republican candidate for both Congress and Kansas Attorney General.
Early life.
McAtee was born on July 8, 1928 to Lloyd M. McAtee and Grace V. Woodman. McAtee was raised two miles south of the Kansas-Nebraska border in Mahaska, a Washington County, Kansas town named by his grandfather.
The Great Depression hit about a year after McAtee was born. Their lender foreclosed on the McAtee family farm. His family was able to save the farm by raising turkeys and sheep, selling butter, cottage cheese and produce. This experience seems to have shaped McAtee’s political views at an early age.
McAtee graduated from Mahaska High School in 1946 and then enrolled at Washburn University. His parents helped him financially, but he earned cash by washing dishes in the school cafeteria and at the Kansas Beta Chapter of Phi Delta Theta, where he was a member. He also worked as a clerk at Helzberg's Jewelers and used some money he had saved from 4-H projects. In 2008, Phi Delta Theta announced a scholarship for Washburn students would bear his name.
McAtee graduated from Washburn with an undergraduate degree in political science and history on June 4, 1950. He also received a second lieutenant's commission in the United States Marine Corps Reserve.
U.S. Marine Corps.
McAtee, who had been in the Platoon Leaders program at Washburn, said he joined the Marine reserves because he wanted to fight the spread of communism. Three weeks after he was commissioned, war broke out in Korea when the north attacked the south. McAtee, who was enrolled in law school, had to withdraw and went on active duty in October 1950.
After receiving intensive training to become a combat lieutenant, he found himself in the Pusan Perimeter in South Korea, a tiny pocket of allied troops holding out against the North Koreans. At Pusan, he joined a line company in "G-3-7" – George Company in the 3rd Battalion of the 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division.
After the Korean War, McAtee remained a committed supporter of his Marines. He was the legal officer for 1st Marine Division Association. He was also judge advocate for the General Lewis Walt Chapter of the Marine Corps League in Topeka and judge advocate of the Kansas Department of the Marine Corps League. McAtee was president of the Northeast Kansas Korean War Memorial, which was dedicated on July 4, 2003. McAtee was also a key supporter of the Topeka High School Junior ROTC program. He was also involved in the effort to clear the names and reinstate Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short who were demoted after the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
After leaving active duty in 1953, McAtee returned to law school at Washburn. McAtee graduated from law school in the fall of 1955.
]Upon graduation from Washburn Law School, McAtee joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In a Topeka Capital-Journal story years later when he was running for Kansas Attorney General, McAtee said he wanted to join the FBI because he fought in Korea to stop communism, and that war ended in a stalemate. "I wanted to continue the fight against international communism." McAtee sought an assignment in New York to work in counterespionage, but instead was sent to Texas and later Montana.
In 1957, McAtee told an FBI official he was unhappy with his assignments because he wasn't in counterespionage. Within two weeks, he got a letter of censure from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover for his attitude and 30 days later received an honorable discharge as a captain from U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, which was arranged by the FBI against his will.
McAtee remained in the FBI until December 31, 1959, when he resigned after being assigned to become a Polish-speaking FBI agent, which would have required him to stay in bureau for another four years.
Legal career.
Following the FBI were stints as an assistant U.S. attorney in Kansas and the pardon and parole attorney and administrative assistant to Kansas Governor John Anderson.
In the spring of 1961, McAtee was appointed the director of penal institutions (later renamed the secretary of corrections). As director, McAtee supervised the hanging executions of four men at Lansing State Penitentiary in April 1965.
During his time as director of penal institutions, McAtee came to know Perry E. Smith and Richard E. Hickock, killers of four members of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas who were slain on November 15, 1959. Smith and Hickock were immortalized in author Truman Capote's book In Cold Blood. McAtee left this position in 1969.
After serving as director of penal institutions, McAtee worked a second stint in the U.S. attorney's office in Kansas starting in 1969, this time as the first assistant U.S. attorney. He entered private practice in 1970 and was a partner in Eidson, Lewis, Porter and Haynes, a Topeka law firm, until 1989 when it dissolved. He next served as an attorney of counsel in Schroer, Rice, Wisler & Morton.
McAtee was one of two attorneys representing the Topeka school district when the Brown v. Board of Education case was reopened. After a six-week hearing in 1986 in U.S. District Court, District Judge Richard Rogers found the school district was substantially in compliance with the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision that ended racial segregation in American schools. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision and sent the case back to Rogers, who monitored it for another 13 or 14 years. Rogers then ruled the school district was in compliance and that decision was accepted.
During the course of his legal career, McAtee argued cases before the Kansas Court of Appeals, the Kansas Supreme Court and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and was admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court. He was listed in Best Lawyers in America, under the category of business litigation, since it was first published in 1983 and was rated "AV," the highest professional and ethical rating given, in the Martindale-Hubbell directory of attorneys in all states.
Political Campaigns.
In the 1964 primary election, McAtee ran fourth among four Republican candidates seeking the party's nomination for the 2nd Congressional District. In the August 1968 primary election for the attorney general's office, McAtee ran fourth in a field of six Republicans. He took another stab at politics in 1972, when he again ran for the 2nd Congressional District seat. McAtee beat Joan Finney, then a Republican, in the primary election. In the general election, McAtee got 63,000 votes to Democrat Bill Roy's 101,000 votes. He ran for the Republican nomination for Kansas Attorney General in 2002 finishing third.

<doc id="19134437" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19134437" title="Investiture of the Prince of Wales">
Investiture of the Prince of Wales

The Investiture of the Prince of Wales is the ceremony marking the formal creation of the title of Prince of Wales, similar to a coronation. An investiture is not required for the Princes of Wales, as the title is created via letters patent, and consequently the ceremony is for formal purposes only.
History.
The tradition of investing the heir of the English, and subsequently British, monarch with the title of "Prince of Wales" began in 1301, when King Edward I of England, having completed the conquest of Wales, gave the title to his heir, Prince Edward (later King Edward II of England).
Form.
Princes of Wales may be invested, but investiture is not necessary to be created Prince of Wales. Peers were also invested, but investitures for peers ceased in 1621, during a time when peerages were being created so frequently that the investiture ceremony became cumbersome. Most investitures for Princes of Wales were held in front of Parliament, but in 1911, the future King Edward VIII was invested in Caernarfon Castle in Wales. The present Prince of Wales, Charles, was also invested there in 1969.
Regalia.
During the reading of the letters patent creating the Prince, the Honours of the Principality of Wales are delivered to the Prince. The coronet of the heir-apparent bears four crosses pattée alternating with four fleurs-de-lis, surmounted by a single arch (the Sovereign's crowns are of the same design, but use two arches). A gold rod is also used in the insignia; gold rods were formally used in the investitures of dukes, but survive now in the investitures of Princes of Wales only. Also part of the insignia are a ring, a girdle, a sword and a robe.
Coronets.
It is recorded that Llywelyn the Last had deposited his coronet along with his other regalia with the monks at Cymer Abbey for safekeeping at the start of his final campaign in 1282. He was killed later that year. It was seized and presented to King Edward I of England as a token of the complete annihilation of the independent Welsh state.
Frederick, Prince of Wales, later had the Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales, made at a cost of one hundred and forty pounds and five shillings in 1728. It is unknown whether Frederick ever wore the coronet himself but it was used both by his son, George III, and his grandson, George IV, when each was Prince of Wales.
Due to age Frederick's coronet was replaced by the Coronet of George, Prince of Wales, made for the future King George V. At George's own coronation in 1911, the coronet was worn by his son, Edward, the next Prince of Wales.
When the former King Edward VIII went into exile as the Duke of Windsor in 1936 (following his abdication), he took with him the Coronet of George, Prince of Wales, a highly controversial—and illegal—act. This coronet had been specially created for King George V, then Prince of Wales, and he wore it at his father's coronation in 1902. The traditional coronet being unavailable, and with the older Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales being viewed unusable due to age, the only option was the creation of a new Prince of Wales crown to be used for the investiture of the current heir apparent to the throne as Prince of Wales. The Coronet of Charles, Prince of Wales, was produced by a committee under Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, then husband of Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon.
Investiture of Prince Charles.
Prince Charles was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester by Letters Patent on 26 July 1958, though his actual investiture did not take place until 1 July 1969. The ceremony at Caernarfon was well received by the majority of Welsh people but some nationalists view it as being associated with the subjugation of Welsh people since the 13th century, when Edward I deposed the last native Prince of Wales, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. Previous investitures had taken place at various locations, including the Palace of Westminster, the seat of Parliament. The Welsh borough of Swansea was granted city status to mark the occasion. Taught by Edward Millward, Prince Charles spent ten weeks leading up to his Investiture learning about Welsh culture and language and during the ceremony he gave his replies in both English and Welsh.
The investiture was watched by millions on television, and attracted large and excited crowds in Caernarfon, but it also aroused considerable hostility among a minority of nationalist and republican Welsh people, some of whom were under constant police surveillance and were the subject of much intimidation from the secret services. Threats of violence ensued as well as a short bombing campaign, although these acts were generally more related to the greater nationalist campaign for Welsh independence. The nationalist campaign against the investiture culminated with an attempted bombing by two members of the Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (Movement for the Defence of Wales). On the eve of the investiture 2 bombers were killed whilst placing a bomb outside government offices in Abergele. In recent years, it has been claimed that the KGB plotted to disrupt the proceedings by bombing a bridge in Porthmadog.
In recent opinion polls the majority of Welsh people have remained in favour of the monarchy with 70% plus support the usual figure; a poll in North Wales in 2003 by the Daily Post found 80% of respondents wanted Prince William to become the next Prince of Wales. Welsh speakers are no less likely to be monarchist, with a BBC Wales poll in 1999 finding that 73% of Welsh speakers want the position of Prince of Wales to continue. A BBC poll to mark the 40th anniversary of the investiture showed that 58% of the Welsh population were in favour of a similar public ceremony for Prince William when Charles becomes king.
On the evening of 28 June 2009—to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the investiture—BBC Parliament broadcast a repeat of the original BBC TV colour outside broadcast from 1 July 1969, fronted by Cliff Michelmore and Richard Baker. This was preceded by an interview with Prince Charles recorded a few days before his investiture.

Roy Hart

Roy Hart (born Rubin Hartstein; 30 October 1926 – 18 May 1975) was an actor from South Africa at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. He was a pupil of Alfred Wolfsohn's for many years and then furthered the work on voice after Wolfsohn's death. Hart's vocal range and virtuosity led composers such as (Hans Werner Henze and Peter Maxwell Davies to write musical works specifically for his voice. Hart founded the Roy Hart Theatre in 1968 and developed the Roy Hart Theatre approach, which is still taught and practised in the south of France at Malérargues and around the world today.
Early life.
Hart was born as Reuben Hartstein on 31 October 1926 to Polish-Lithuanian parents in Johannesburg, South Africa. He had an Orthodox Jewish education, but felt that he never made friends easily. He studied English, the history of music, philosophy and psychology at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. In 1946, he performed "Peer Gynt" in a University production to much acclaim. Due to the conflict between his innate desire to go on stage and his families’ Rabbinical origin, he decided to leave South Africa.
Move to London and meeting with Alfred Wolfsohn.
In May 1947, Hart Joined the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, London, as a scholarship student, using the name Royden Hart. At RADA. he was a successful student, yet felt "that the characters I performed so convincingly were merely figments of my imagination . . . something was lacking". On 5 June 1947, he met Alfred Wolfsohn, and wrote of him in his diary that he was "a man who I feel has the ability to bring out the very best in me. … He is indubitably the finest thing that has happened in my life". His work with Wolfsohn created problems at RADA. In 1949, he graduated from RADA and the director wrote of him: "A good voice but is inclined to over-voice… He deserved his free fee place."
In the 1950s, As Wolfsohn became ill, Hart took on some of the teaching of other students. Hart gave vocal demonstrations to experts in music or theatre, such as Yehudi Menuhin, Laurence Olivier, and Peter Ustinov, and was in contact with the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. These initial contacts generated interest in his work, but not much came of them.
In 1960 he began to work at Shenley Psychiatric Hospital, and maintained contacts with the psychotherapuetic world for the rest of his career. In 1962, Wolfsohn died, and Hart created a group of students to continue Wolfsohn's legacy.
In 1964, a Documentary film was made of the group (available on DVD "Theatre of Being") http://www.roy-hart.com/being.htm .
Roy Hart Theatre.
Hart found the Roy Hart Theatre in 1967. In 1969 he began a period of intense international artistic and psycho-therapeutic activity, including solo performances in Henze's "Versuch über Schweine", Peter Maxwell Davies's "Eight Songs for a Mad King", Stockhausen's "Spiral", and Euripides's "The Bacchae" performed with his own company. He was a guest speaker at psycho-therapeutic and theatre congresses throughout the world; Jerzy Grotowski and Peter Brook held discussions with him in his studio in London.

HNK Borovo

HNK Borovo is a Croatian football club based in the Borovo Naselje area of the river port of Vukovar.
History.
The club was formed in 1933 as Bata SK by Tomáš Baťa, and it was the promotional team for the Bata Borovo factory. Initially the company didn´t have its own club, but it was represented by the earlier existing VASK (Vukovarski Amaterski Sportski Klub). With the creation and official opening of a new football field in 1933, VASK was disestablished, and in its place was created in October 1933 a new club, SK Bata.
Between 1933 and 1939 the club competed in the regional league of Osijek. In 1939, after winning their provincial league (župa) they earned the first ever opportunity to play at national level. For that season, Bata brought to their ranks a new coach, the Hungarian Károly Nemes, and players such as Milan Antolković from Građanski Zagreb, Đorđe Lojančić and Nikola Perlić from SK Jugoslavija, Slavko Šurdonja from BSK Belgrade, among others. They were placed in the Serbian League, which, after the creation of a separate league of the Banovina of Croatia in 1940, became the only Croatian club to compete in the 1940-41 Serbian League. After that season, however, it joined other Croatian clubs in the 1942 Croatian First League.
After the end of the Second World War and with the re-establishment of the Yugoslav league system, the club changed its name to SFD Slaven, to be renamed again in 1954 into NK Borovo and to play as such all the way until the Croatian War of Independence and subsequent disintegration of Yugoslavia beginning in 1991. Its more successful period was between the mid 1950s until mid 1970s when the club in several occasions fights for promotion into the Yugoslav First League. It played mostly in the Yugoslav Second League and on three occasions reaches the quarter-finals of the Yugoslav Cup.
The club was re-established in 2005 as HNK Borovo and begins competing in the local lower leagues. After a series of promotions, HNK Borovo reaches in 2010 the Croatian Third League.

Moniru Ravanipor

Moniro Ravanipor (1952, Bushehr – Present) Moniro Ravanipour is an internationally acclaimed innovative writer who is the author of ten titles published in Iran, including two collections of short fiction, Kanizu and Satan’s Stones, and the novels The Drowned, Heart of Steel, and Gypsy by Fire. Her tales, described as “reminiscent in their fantastic blend of realism, myth, and superstition of writers like Rulfo, Garcia Marquez, even Tutuola,” frequently take as their setting the small, remote village in southern Iran where she was born. Nahid Mozaffari, editor of Strange Times, My Dear: The International PEN Anthology of Contemporary Iranian Literature, writes that Ravanipour “has been successful in the treatment of the complex subjects of tradition and modernity, juxtaposing elements of both, and exposing them in all their contradictions without idealizing either.” Ms. Ravanipour was among seventeen activists to face trial in Iran for their participation in the 2000 Berlin Conference, accused of taking part in anti-Iran propaganda. Copies of her current work were recently stripped from bookstore shelves in Iran in a countrywide police action. She is a former Brown University International Writers Project Fellow.
Early life.
Moniro Ravanipour was born on 1952, in Bushehr, South of Iran. Lived in Bushehr till she was 17, and moved to Shiraz for Pahlavi Private High school. 
Joined Shiraz Pahlavi University in 1972 and studied Chemistry, and then changed major and took a degree in Psychology.
She started theatre in Bushehr and joined the Theater and Literary Society of Bushehr.
Acting and Theatre Experience.
Moniro joined a theatre group in Bushehr called The Theatre and Literary Society of Bushehr. In 1967 Moniro acted in Mother, A play by Manouchehr Atashi. She then continued to act and participated in the production of several plays in Shiraz. Moniro worked with a group of college students for a play called Abazar Ghafari which was banned later. In 1975 she joined Shiraz Theatre Group for producing a play named Moalem, by Shapour Jowrkesh, and in 1976 participated in Tous Theatre Festival, and worked with Shapour Jowrkesh again, for a play named Khoubchehr.
Post Revolution.
In early post revolution years she was involved in political activities and was banned from studying. During these years, her brother was executed, all her sister were banned from education in elementary and high school, one of her sisters and her husband were sentenced to death penalty and escaped Iran, one of her brother in laws got arrested several times. For a decade, she couldn't have a stable place of residence due to the mentioned situation, and she moved from one place to another. She wrote her first short story collection in 1977 named "The Sparrow and Mr. President" which was immediately banned from publishing and collected from shelves. After their house was attacked and pillaged in Bushehr, her family moved to Shiraz, and then Moniro moved to Tehran and using a fake name, worked as a worker in Daroupakhsh Factory. After her true identity was revealed using another fake name she worked for another six months in Amidi Factory. Later she worked the grave yard shift nurse in a private hospital, again using a fake name. In 1983 Moniro went back to Shiraz to visit her parents, and she got arrested on the street, when the regime was doing the random arrest of the citizens. It was during the terrible prison days that she decided to become a writer of big fame and success when she is free again, so she would not get killed and forgotten like many others were.
Writing career.
Moniro started writing again from 1965, and wrote children's books and screen plays. 
A year after Iran-Iraq War she went to the City Khanaqin boundaries, for writing a novel about war using the identity of a Martyr's mother. 
After 1988 Moniro published her works using her real name and in 1994 for the first time she was invited the Women's studies Organization of Vienna. Later she was invited for speeches to 21 countries, and then she was invited by: Khaneh Farhanghaye Jahan, Goethe-Institut, Literary Center of Gumusluk, Bodrum, Gothenburg expo in Sweden, Heinrich Böll Foundation, in Germany, France, U.S.A., and ...
Style.
She is famous for using magic realism, but the truth is that she uses the bitter reality she found in the happenings and real life in her homeland. Despite the bold use of surrealism and magical realism, she uses realism too. The settings of her stories are not just the rural world, but her work pictures life and culture in the urban life as well.
In 2006 she moved to the U.S. getting a scholarship in Brown university and then at UNLV's Black Mountain Institute's City of Asylum as a visiting author for three years. 
During her stay in the U.S. she has gone to Sacramento, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Providence, for lectures and speeches. Her short stories have been translated into: French, German, Swedish, Turkish, English, Arabic, Kurdish, Chinese...

Randall House Publications

Randall House Publications is an American publisher of Christian literature and church resources. Based in Nashville, Tennessee, it produces about forty pieces of Sunday School curriculum each quarter. Although chartered as the publishing arm of the National Association of Free Will Baptists to produce materials for use in Sunday School classrooms that adhered to Free Will Baptist doctrine, in recent years the company has expanded their product offerings to include a variety of church resources: Bible study materials, trade books, commentaries, teacher training workshops, youth and youth worker conferences, and digital products, useful to other denominations as well. 
In 2004, Randall House released its newest line of Sunday School curriculum named CLEAR Curriculum, [http://www.CLEARcurriculum.com] based on the CLEAR Learning System. For the first time, Sunday School teachers of all age groups (infants to adults) were able to use materials specifically designed to help a teacher communicate information that was educationally conducive to comprehension, retention, and application while keeping everyone on the same biblical topic. Randall House has 11 departments: Administrative, Book Division, Training, Design, Distribution, Digital/IT, Editorial, Marketing, Printing, Sales, and Student & Children’s Ministry. Randall House is one of the few Christian publishers remaining that houses its own design, printing, and distribution services.
History.
In 1935, the National Association of Free Will Baptists (NAFWB) selected Rev. Winford Davis of Missouri to become the first Sunday School Secretary. Only three years later, the NAFWB elected the first Sunday School Board, which developed the National Sunday School Convention (NSSC) in 1940. For the next seven years (1940-1947), the NSSC functioned as the Sunday School Board, promoting its principles and acting upon directives. In fact, they worked so closely together the chairman of the Sunday School Board, W. E. Coville was also elected president of the NSSC. The Sunday School Board served as the Nominating Committee for NSSC officers, which assured that elected officers were qualified and competent individuals.
During the first year the NSSC elected 10 officers, two of which became notable men in Free Will Baptist ranks. L.C. Johnson, the Chairman of Denominational Enterprise, later became the first president of the Free Will Baptist Bible College in Nashville, Tennessee. The Chairman of Literature was L. R. Ennis who became the second president of FWBBC.
Since 1940, the work of the Sunday School Board has been promoted via the NSSC. In order to increase participation, the Sunday School Board brought back that work under the direct supervision of the Board in 1947. The NSSC continued its conventions but voted in 1950 to dissolve as a separate entity. The conventions continued to meet, however, under the direction of the Sunday School Board. There is mention of a 10th annual NSSC in the 1952 "Minutes". The 1953 "NAFWB Minutes" says that future conventions will meet biennially (every two years). Thus, in reality the 1938 Sunday School Board had started a separate organization (under the auspices of the NAFWB) to promote Sunday School.
The year 1955 held another turning point in the organization of the Sunday School movement within the Free Will Baptist denomination. Rev. William J. Mishler, the first full-time Sunday School Promotional Secretary (elected in 1954), began promoting regional conventions, sponsored by the Sunday School Board, to replace the NSSC, which met biennially. The purpose was to obtain more participation than was possible in national rallies. During 1955 as well, the Sunday School Department moved into its first offices at 3801 Richland Avenue, Nashville, Tennessee.
Because of the increased promotion of Sunday School benefits to churches’ spiritual growth, attendance, and effectiveness, the NAFWB approved launching their own Free Will Baptist-produced Sunday School literature program, which was initiated in early 1958. However, in 1959 the worked ceased and the office doors closed due to financial difficulties. Thus, the Sunday School Board contracted Sunday School materials from the Free Will Baptist Press (now Ayden Press, which was never under the auspices of the NAFWB) in Ayden, North Carolina as it did in the 1940s. Yet, at the same time in 1960, the Oklahoma State Association of Free Will Baptists seeing the need to publish the adult study materials began to do so when the National Nashville offices closed. They maintained the production of these materials until 1962.
Thanks to the determination of several leaders within the Free Will Baptist ranks, especially Rev. Roger Reeds who was the Sunday School Board Secretary, the Nashville office reopened and literature publishing resumed in 1962. Roger Reeds became the first full-time General Director of the Sunday School Department (SS Department). Finally, Free Will Baptist churches now had an established curriculum by Free Will Baptists for Free Will Baptists.
The next few years boasted several milestones for the SS Department. In 1965, the SS Department took up residence in the new NAFWB offices on Murfreesboro Road in Nashville, Tennessee. The SS Department occupied of floor space, sharing shipping and warehouse space with the other departments. Its first non-curriculum publication—"Pauline Epistles" by Dr. Robert E. Picirilli—released in 1967. One year later, the SS Department moved into its new building behind the Murfreesboro Road office complex. The following year in 1969 the first Sunday School curriculum for adults was created, marking the first time every age level had Free Will Baptist curriculum.
In 1971 the company expanded to a building on of land on Bush Road, still the location for Randall House Publications. In 1972 the SS Department adopted Randall House Publications as their trade name in honor of Benjamin Randall, the founder of the Northern line of Free Will Baptists. The next year brought a record sales of $1 million. 
The Church Training Service (CTS) and the SS Department (Randall House) merged in 1978. CTS created materials and curriculum for use during Sunday night and Wednesday evening church services. These products were also used as preparatory materials for students competing in various Bible competitions at the NAFWB Convention held every July. The joining of these two departments meant all curriculum publishing was now governed under one board. At that time, Dr. Malcolm Fry served as the General Director for CTS. 
Alongside its curriculum publishing, Randall House intermittently published trade books, mostly concerning Free Will Baptist distinctives and Arminian theology. The year 1987 marked the first installation of the Randall House Commentary—"Romans" by Leroy Forlines—with all remaining New Testament volumes to be completed in the following years.
After 31 years of service, Dr. Roger Reeds retired, making way for the newly elected General Director, Dr. Alton Loveless. Dr. Loveless began his tenure at Randall House in 1994. Under Dr. Loveless’ direction, Randall House upgraded much of the Department’s prepress technology and developed an extensive backlist of print-on-demand titles. He also developed a solid editorial team. His business acumen set Randall House in the direction for a sound financial future.
In 2002, Dr. Alton Loveless retired, and Ron Hunter Jr. became the third Executive Director and CEO of Randall House Publications. Under his creative and visionary leadership, Randall House made great strides in producing more relevant and reputable publisher. (You may want to follow his blog WriteIdeaOnLeadership In 2004, the launch of CLEAR Curriculum marked a huge feat in the redevelopment of curriculum targeted not only at Free Will Baptist churches, but all evangelical denominations. In 2005, the new Book Division released its first children’s book to the CBA [http://www.cbaonline.org marketplace—"The Case of Stewart’s Ship" by Stan Toler and Debra White Smith. What followed was a concerted effort to provide not only quality Sunday School curriculum for all age levels, but also trade books, Bible studies, and other church resources to the whole Church community. In 2007, the NAFWB voted to file “Randall House Publications of the National Association of Free Will Baptists” as the official name. Randall House is their DBA name.
Thanks to Randall House's belief in building believers through Christian education, they launched the longterm D6 campaign in 2007. Over the next decade, this movement will encourage church members to adopt the D6 [http://www.D6Family.com lifestyle where parents reconnect to their kids and transfer their spiritual heritage and values by regular interaction every day. D6 is where the parents are to be the spiritual leaders of the home teaching morals, character, and biblical insights as prescribed in Deuteronomy 6:7. Randall House believes that most parents want to connect with their kids in order to pass along their faith and values, but discovered so many simply do not know how. By using D6family.com as a resource, Randall House allows parents to subscribe to free resources that can help them launch forward in leading their family. The principles and products of D6 help parents reconnect to their kids.
Divisions.
Editorial.
The Editorial Department is responsible for the production (writing, proofing, editing) of printed and digital Sunday School curriculum, small group Bible studies, materials for Student & Children ministries, and all marketing pieces associated with these products. The Sunday School curriculum provides studies for all ages: nursery, preschool, elementary, junior high, senior high, young adult (college and career), and adult—a total of 39 curriculum pieces each quarter.
The Editorial department produces digital curriculum or “curriculum-on-demand,” delivered primarily on the Internet as well as electronic resources that supplement existing printed curriculum and products. The goal of the digital curriculum area is the publication of professionally written, edited, and designed materials for purchase, download, and immediate use.
To date, the Editorial Department’s most noted achievement is developing and implementing the CLEAR Learning System. CLEAR Curriculum is a coordinated, whole family approach to Bible study that enables the entire family to study the same scriptural theme each week. CLEAR is an acronym that stands for five steps in the learning process. Each lesson is built around these five steps: Connect, Learn, Explore, Apply, and Respond. "Connect" captures the student’s attention and plugs the lesson into life. "Learn" presents the facts of the Bible logically and chronologically. "Explore" delves deeper into the historical and background elements. "Apply" involves the student to see how biblical principles should be lived out today. Then, finally, "Respond" calls for a decision or action that reflects the work of the Holy Spirit impacting daily life. Through this interrelated Sunday School curriculum families have the opportunity to discuss and apply truths learned together as they study God’s Word. 
Since its release in 2004, CLEAR Curriculum has received recognition and various awards from throughout the publishing industry. CLEAR Curriculum received Best of Division and the Award of Excellence from the Printing Industry Association of the South 2006 Graphic Awards for "CLEAR Living": Character of Christ. The Award of Excellence was awarded to "Explorer’s Guide 2:" The Gift of Grace; "CLEAR Horizon": On a Mission From God; and "My Cuddle Time Bible Storybook": I Believe in God! The same year the Evangelical Press Association [http://www.epassoc.org/ awarded "CLEAR Horizon" 1st place in Publication Design.
Book publishing.
In 2004, Randall House separated book publishing from the curriculum editorial department. This allowed new guidelines and greater resources to enable the Book Division to grow. The Book Division publishes various genres—Christian living, Bible reference, pastoral helps, small group studies (book and DVD), fiction, and theological materials.
Vertical Three.
Vertical Three (the student ministry of Randall House) serves to equip youth workers to be more effective in ministry. This goal is achieved through training and ministry programs for youth and youth workers. The annual National Youth Conference (NYC) [http://www.fwbnyc.com] draws young people from across the country to participate in worship services, training opportunities, service projects, and more. The Truth & Peace Leadership Conference provides intensive leadership training for high school students. Truth & Peace (T&P) celebrates its 30th year in 2013. T&P alumni serve in leadership positions around the world in local church ministries, national ministries, and international missions.
Over two thousand hours of community service are logged in three days during the NYC by the students who participate in Reach That Guy, serving homeless shelters, rescue missions, and other charitable agencies. The Music and Arts Festival and Bible Competition encourages students to discover, develop, and dedicate their talents to God’s service. Select participants are chosen for the National Youth Evangelistic Team, which travels during the summer to minister in churches and youth camps.
Vertical Three continues to develop Bible studies and programs to assist local churches and youth workers. Networking opportunities encourage youth workers to share their experience, needs, and challenges.

Johann Vogel (composer)

Johann Christoph Vogel (also given as Fogel) (18 March 1756 Nuremberg-28 June 1788 Paris) was a German composer. 
Life.
He spent most of his life working in France. He moved to Paris in 1776, and entered the service of the Duke of Montmorency and then of the Count of Valentinois as a horn player. He composed a great number of orchestral and chamber works but is best remembered for his oratorio "Jephté", performed at the Concert Spirituel in September 1781, and for his two operas. Although his music was received favourably, his works never became extremely popular because they were deemed as 'too complicated and baroque'. 
Vogel was an enthusiast for the operas of Gluck, and his first opera, "La toison d'or", is dedicated to the composer as 'législateur de la musique'. In places it appears to be a faithful stylistic imitation of Gluck's two Iphigenia operas, "Iphigénie en Tauride" and "Iphigenie auf Tauris ", but with a fuller orchestration and a greater lyricism in the arias. The opera was written in 1781 but was not performed until 5 September 1786 at the Opéra National de Paris. It played for only 12 performances and was met with limited success since it seemed old-fashioned and contained no ballet. Philippe Desriaux, for many years the secretary of Baron von Tschudi, wrote the librettos for both "La toison d'or" and Vogel’s second opera, "Démophon". Its posthumous première (at the Opéra on 22 September 1789) was given only after the première of Cherubini's opera on the same subject. Among the musical qualities of this work are the variety of recitative forms, the treatment of the woodwind as solo instruments and the harmonic colour of the choruses. The overture, composed in monothematic sonata form, remained popular into the early 19th century, and was incorporated into Pierre Gardel's ballet-pantomime "Psyché" (1790), which had more than 1000 performances at the Opéra National de Paris between its première and 1829.

Wang Yu (chancellor)

Wang Yu (王璵) (died 768) was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, who became trusted by Emperor Suzong due to his studies in witchcraft and the employment of such witchcraft on Emperor Suzong's behalf, such that Emperor Suzong eventually made him chancellor.
Background.
It is not known when Wang Yu was born. He was a fifth-generation descendant of Wang Fangqing, who served as a chancellor during the reign of Wu Zetian. His intervening ancestors' names were recorded as Wang Jiao (王曒), Wang Chong (王寵), Wang Zhonglian (王仲連), and Wang Shao (王紹), none of whom was recorded to have carried any official titles except for Wang Zhonglian, who served as a secretarial officer at Yang Prefecture (揚州, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). Wang Yu himself was said to be well-studied in the worshipping of gods and spirits and particularly paid attention to the proper times to offer sacrifices.
During Emperor Xuanzong's reign.
Toward the end of the "Kaiyuan" era (713-742) of Wu Zetian's grandson Emperor Xuanzong, Emperor Xuanzong was paying great attention to Taoist doctrines and ceremonies. Wang Yu made a submission to Emperor Xuanzong requesting that an altar, to be called the Spring Altar (春壇, "Chun Tan"), be built to the east of the capital Chang'an and dedicated to the Blue Emperor (青帝, "Qing Di"). Emperor Xuanzong agreed, and he made Wang an official-scholar at the ministry of worship (太常寺, "Taichang Si") and an imperial censor (侍御史, "Shiyushi"), as well as a special emissary of worship (祠祭使, "Ciji Shi"). It was said that Wang drew favors from the emperor due to his dedication to worshipping gods on Emperor Xuanzong's behalf. It was further said that while previously, the common populace already had a custom of sacrificing joss paper to the spirits, it was Wang who brought this custom into official ceremonies.
During Emperor Suzong's and Emperor Daizong's reigns.
After Emperor Xuanzong's son Emperor Suzong became emperor in 756, Wang Yu was promoted to be the minister of worship (太常卿, "Taichang Qing"). Because his worship of the gods pleased Emperor Suzong, Emperor Suzong often gave him rewards. In 758, when Emperor Suzong removed the chancellors Cui Yuan and Li Lin from their posts, he made Wang "Zhongshu Shilang" (中書侍郎) -- the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, "Zhongshu Sheng") and gave him the designation "Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi" (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor "de facto". It was said that even before this, Wang did not have a good reputation among the people, and after he was made chancellor, his reputation grew worse due to his incompetence.
At Wang's suggestion, Emperor Suzong built an altar dedicated to the god "Taiyi" (太一 or 太乙) to the south of Chang'an. Around this time, Emperor Suzong was ill, and the fortunetellers told him that he was being cursed by a god of a mountain or a river. Wang thus suggested that a group of witches and eunuchs be commissioned to go to various mountains and rivers of the empire to pray for Emperor Suzong. The witches that Wang selected used this opportunity to extort bribes from the local officials. One of them, who was sent to Huang Prefecture (黃州, in modern Wuhan, Hubei), took an entourage of several tens of young hoodlums with her and stayed at the station for imperial messengers with them. When the prefect of Huang Prefecture, Zuo Zhen (左震), visited in the morning, he found the station door locked. He became angry, and he ordered that his police officers break into the station and that the witch be dragged out to be decapitated. He also killed the hoodlums that she was with, and then confiscated the bribes that they were carrying. He submitted the funds to Emperor Suzong and requested that the funds be used to pay the taxes that the people of Huang Prefecture would otherwise be responsible for. Emperor Suzong accepted the funds but did not punish Wang. In 759, indeed, pursuant to Wang's suggestions, he personally offered sacrifices to the gods of the nine palaces (九宮神, "Jiugong Shen"). Later that year, however, he made Wang the minister of justice (刑部尚書, "Xingbu Shangshu") and removed him from the chancellor position.
In 760, Wang was made the prefect of Pu Prefecture (蒲州, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), as well as the military governor ("jiedushi") of the surrounding prefectures. In 761, Wang was made the secretary general at Yang Prefecture as well as the military governor of Huainan Circuit (淮南, i.e., the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River). After an occasion after Emperor Suzong offered sacrifices, he made Wang the governor of Yue Prefecture (越州, roughly modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang) as well as the military governor of Zhedong Circuit (浙東, i.e., the region east of the Qiantang River). Sometime thereafter, he was recalled to serve as "Taizi Shaobao" (太子少保) and then "Taizi Shaoshi" (太子少師) -- both positions advisorial positions to the crown prince. Wang died in 768, during the reign of Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong. He was buried with honors and given the posthumous name "Jianhuai" (簡懷, meaning "undiscriminating and just"). His great-grandson Wang Tuan later served as a chancellor near the end of Tang Dynasty, under Emperor Zhaozong.

Ossie Brown

Ossie B. Brown (March 19, 1926 – August 28, 2008) was a Baton Rouge Democrat who served two six-year terms as district attorney of East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, from 1972 to 1984. In 1970, he successfully defended United States Army Sergeant David Mitchell in the My Lai Massacre cases. Brown was also a talented musician and an active Baptist layman.
Ossie (pronounced OH SEE) Brown was born to George F. Brown and the former Lovie Phenald in Winnfield, the seat of Winn Parish and the traditional home of the Long political dynasty. He was reared in Baker in East Baton Rouge Parish and graduated from Baker High School, where he was named president of Boys State and composed the Baker High "alma mater". He attended Napa Junior College in Napa, California, and then entered the United States Navy during World War II. Thereafter, he procured his Bachelor of Arts degree in pre-law from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, where he was the university drum major. He lettered in basketball and tennis and was president of Sigma Chi social fraternity. Brown also graduated from the LSU Paul M. Hebert Law Center. He then launched a half-century-long criminal law practice in Baton Rouge. Prior to his tenure as district attorney, Brown was the Baton Rouge municipal court judge. In 1970, former LSU quarterback and future East Baton Rouge Parish Mayor-President Pat Screen joined Brown's firm.
The My Lai case.
Brown's most memorable court victory was in the 1970 trial of Sergeant Mitchell (born 1940) held at Fort Hood in central Texas. Mitchell was accused by the Army of having committed war crimes against the Vietnamese during the Vietnam War. Brown predicted that Mitchell's prosectors, who rested their arguments early, had not "proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt." The next day, Brown collapsed in his motel room and was later taken to a hospital in Temple in Bell County. The judge, Colonel George R. Robinson, adjourned the case until Brown's recovery.
One of the witnesses against Mitchell was former radioman Charles Sledge (born 1947), an African American luggage-factory worker from Sardis in Panola County in northwestern Mississippi. Sledge said that he "positively" saw Mitchell shoot a group of Vietnamese women, children, and senior men who took cover in a ditch. Sledge also said that he saw Mitchell confer with Second Lieutenant William Calley Jr., at the edge of the trench before the two opened fire on the villagers from about five or six feet away. "They were falling and screaming," Sledge testified. Calley, meanwhile, was tried November 16, 1970, at Fort Benning, Georgia. Brown brought out several discrepancies between Sledge's courtroom statements and his earlier testimony before Army investigators; one was Sledge's earlier claim that he "believed" Mitchell had fired into the ditch and his claim at the trial that he was "positive" that Mitchell had killed the civilians.
Other controversies.
As DA, Brown was involved in several controversies. In 1975, he dropped twenty-six felony counts against Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Dave L. Pearce on grounds of Pearce's age and the state of Pearce's health. In 1984, as his tenure wound down, Brown was indicted by a federal grand jury for extortion, mail fraud, and perjury after he failed to indict two men for possession of ten grams of cocaine. The day after the East Baton Rouge Parish grand jury declined to take action against the two suspects, the wealthy father of one of the men lent Brown $168,000. A state district judge testified that Brown had asked him to suppress evidence in the case. Brown was acquitted and said that God wanted him to seek a third term. He had during his tenure crusaded against narcotics and pornography. Though Brown had been the first EBR DA in memory to have been unopposed for a second term in 1978, he was defeated in 1984 by the Republican 
Bryan Edward Bush, Jr., who was unseated after one term.
In 1973, Brown prevented Baton Rouge theaters from showing the X-rated film "The Last Tango in Paris" with Marlon Brando. So had the Rapides Parish District Attorney Edwin O. Ware, III, acted accordingly. In 1979, Brown blocked the showing of the comedy, “Monty Python’s Life of Brian”. Brown asked Baton Rouge magazine distributors not to offer the March 1977 issue of "Hustler", which a state court judge in Ohio ruled obscene.
In 1980, the black attorney Murphy Bell filed suit against the city of Baton Rouge and District Attorney Brown regarding civil rights protection for African-American suspects. The suit, which stemmed from the accidental fatal shooting by police of a black teenager named Clarence Morrison, Jr. (born ca. 1963), claimed, among various allegations, that Brown had used the grand jury investigative procedure as a "legal backup" to support arbitrary actions by the police department. The city and Brown, however, prevailed in the initial court and on appeal.
Activities as DA.
During his time as district attorney, Brown was elected president of both the Louisiana State and the National District Attorney's associations. He was also instrumental in the establishment of the Baton Rouge Rape Crisis Center, the Pretrial Intervention Program, the Victim and Witness Assistance Program, and "I Care", a drug prevention program. Brown served too on the executive council of the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement. He was chairman of the first child abuse committee formed by the National District Attorney's Association. He wrote "You and the Law", a book used in civics classes in the East Baton Rouge Parish school system.
Civic leadership, death and legacy.
He was a member of the advisory board of the Salvation Army and the executive committee of the Boy Scouts of America Istrouma Council. He also worked in the annual Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. He hosted the Lions Club Crippled Children's Telethon. He supported the Louisiana Baptist Children's Home orphanage in Monroe. Since 1964, Brown had been an active member of the Florida Boulevard Baptist Church, where he taught the Fellowship Bible class. Earlier, he had been music director of various churches.
After he left the office of district attorney, Brown resumed his law practice until he retired in the year 2000 from the still existing offices of Ossie Brown at 123 St. Ferdinand Street in Baton Rouge. One of the partners is Brown's son, Dana Brent Brown.
Services were held on August 30, 2008, at the Florida Avenue Baptist Church. Entombment was in the Green Oaks Memorial Park Mausoleum. Brown was survived by his wife of forty-eight years, the former Faye Underwood (born November 5, 1931); two sons, Dana Brown (born July 10, 1962) and wife Natalie (born November 29, 1970) and Kirk Brown of Napa, California; daughter, Kelli B. Leon (born December 24, 1968) of Baton Rouge; four grandchildren, Brycyn Brown, Max Brown, and Alexa and Amber Leon; and four great-grandchildren.
Current EBR District Attorney Hillar Moore, III, told the "Baton Rouge Morning Advocate" that Brown "stood for certain principles and took positions that were always firm. He was always for the victims of crime." Moore said that when he worked for Brown as an investigator while he was still in college and that the DA "adopted me as a son." Moore, who supported Brown in the 1984 election, remained an investigator under DA Bryan Bush despite their partisan difference.
