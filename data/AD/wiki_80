Robert Earl Grace was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for eight seasons between and .
Early minor league career.
Grace's professional baseball career began in , playing for the Lincoln Links and Little Rock Travelers. After playing for the Muskogee Athletics in , Grace did not play professionally in . He played for the Travelers again in , then was signed by the Chicago Cubs organization, where he started the season with the Reading Keystones.
Major league career.
Chicago Cubs.
Grace made his major league debut for the Chicago Cubs in 1929, playing in 27 games and batting .250. After a season back in the minor leagues with the Keystones, he returned to the Cubs for 7 games in before being traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for fellow catcher Rollie Hemsley.
Pittsburgh Pirates.
After batting .280 in 47 games for the Pirates after the trade, Grace was made the Pirates' regular catcher in . He finished the season having committed only 1 error in 413 total chances, to establish a National League fielding record with a .998 fielding percentage, breaking the record set by Shanty Hogan just one year earlier. Over the next three seasons, Grace's playing time decreased in favor of Tom Padden, and after the season, he was traded along with pitcher Claude Passeau for another fellow catcher, Al Todd.
Philadelphia Phillies.
Grace played two seasons for the Phillies, splitting time with Jimmy Wilson and Bill Atwood, Grace was traded a third time. Like each of the previous two trades, he was traded for another catcher, this time to the St. Louis Browns for Cap Clark. However, Grace never played for the Browns after the trade. Instead, he returned to minor league baseball, splitting the 1938 season between the Minneapolis Millers and the Columbus Red Birds. He continued to play in the minors until 1940.

Michael Buerk

Michael Duncan Buerk (born 18 February 1946) is a BBC journalist and newsreader. His reporting of the Ethiopian famine on 23 October 1984 inspired the Band Aid charity record and subsequently, the Live Aid concert.
Early life.
Buerk was born in Solihull, and was educated at Solihull School, an Independent school in the West Midlands where he was a member of the Combined Cadet Force and represented the school on the sports field.
Michael Buerk's hopes of a career in the Royal Air Force were dashed when he failed an eyesight test at the selection centre. After a brief spell as a hod carrier he began his career in journalism with the "Bromsgrove Messenger", "South Wales Echo" (where he shared a house with Sue Lawley in Cardiff), and the "Daily Mail", he joined Radio Bristol in 1970 before becoming a reporter for BBC News in 1973.
Reporter and newsreader.
He was awarded the Golden Nymph award at the Monte Carlo festival for his reports on the famine from Korem in Ethiopia, first broadcast on 23 October 1984. The footage of the famine was shot by Mohamed Amin. He later said that the broadcast was one of "the most influential pieces of television ever broadcast a surge of generosity across the world for Ethiopia[that raised more than $130 million". Another notable bulletin he is renowned for is being the first news reporter on the BBC News in the 2000s, making the bulletin at 0100 GMT on the 1 January 2000.
From 1983 until 1987, Buerk was the BBC's South Africa correspondent during the dying years of apartheid in South Africa. Buerk's uncompromising reports on the brutalities of the regime resulted in the South African government expelling him from the country after four years in the post.
Buerk has worked for
During the 2001 Oscars, Buerk commented live on air that the BBC's arts correspondent Rosie Millard was wearing the 'best supporting dress'.
On the BBC's "Children in Need" Buerk has performed several times along with an ensemble of BBC News presenters. In 2004 he dressed in leather to perform Duran Duran classics; in 2005 he sang the Queen song "Bohemian Rhapsody". He was sometimes imitated by Jon Culshaw on "Dead Ringers".
In 1991, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (MA) by the University of Bath.
Michael Buerk's life and career has been the subject of a comedy musical, "Buerk! The Newsical" which debuted in London at the Network Theatre in May 2013.
Presenting.
In 2010, he narrated Sky1 reality show "Pineapple Dance Studios". Buerk has also made five guest appearances on the BBC's "The One Show" in April and September 2010. He has also appeared as a sit in/cover presenter for Jason Manford on six occasions.
In July 2012, he began to co-present a series on ITV called "Britain's Secret Treasures" alongside Bettany Hughes, looking at fifty of the most remarkable archaeological finds made by the British public. The show returned for a second series in October 2013.
On 6 October 2013, he began hosting "Inside the National Trust", a new Sunday afternoon documentary series.
Other work.
In 2013, Buerk voiced a Marmite advert in which spoof rescue teams rescue lost forgotten jars at the back of cupboards and fridges and despite receiving a number of complaints the advert still continues.
Charity work.
On 28 July 2007, Buerk appeared on a special celebrity version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" with Jennie Bond to raise money for NCH, the children's charity. With a combined effort, they raised £64,000. He is also a supporter of the British Red Cross and in October 2008 came out in support of an Alternate Reality Game, Traces of Hope, which the charity developed.
Opinions.
Buerk asserted in a "Radio Times" interview in August 2005 that the "shift in the balance of power between the sexes" has gone too far and that men are now little more than "sperm donors". In particular, he objected to the many women now in senior positions within the BBC, echoing the outburst the previous year by sacked former Director General, Alasdair Milne. This was in anticipation of Buerk's 45-minute TV-essay, "Michael Buerk on What Are Men For?" as part of Five's six-part "Don't Get Me Started!" series, broadcast on Tuesday 23 August 2005. The reaction to "What Are Men For?" was quite severe, criticising in particular Buerk's choices of sympathetic interview subjects, including "an odious chauvinistic farmer" and "a ridiculous Sloane" according to Guardian journalist Sam Wollaston. Buerk has also criticised contemporary newsreaders for being overpaid Autocue-reading "lame brains". At the end of 2012 he despaired of the state of Britain, and of the BBC. Of the Corporation's coverage of the Thames River Pageant celebrating Britain and the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's accession to the throne, he wrote: "The Dunkirk Little Ships, the most evocative reminders of this country’s bravest hour, were ignored so that a pneumatic bird-brain from "Strictly Come Dancing" could talk to transvestites in Battersea Park."
Personal life.
Buerk lives in Guildford with his wife, with whom he has twin sons. One of his sons, Roland, who is also a BBC journalist, survived the South Asian tsunami on Boxing Day 2004, and was also in Tokyo when the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami struck. On 18 July 2013 he was awarded an honorary "Doctor of the University" degree at Surrey University's awards ceremony in Guildford Cathedral.

Église Notre-Dame de Toute Grâce du Plateau d'Assy

The church of Notre-Dame de Toute Grâce du Plateau d'Assy (Our Lady Full of Grace of the Plateau d'Assy) is a Roman Catholic church in France, constructed on the plateau d'Assy between 1937 and 1946. It faces Mont Blanc, and is within the territory of the commune of Passy, in the Haute-Savoie department. Constructed at the urging of canon Jean Devémy and designed by the Savoyard architect Maurice Novarina, the church is celebrated for its decoration, contributed by some of the best-known artists of the twentieth century. It is also viewed as an important landmark in the development of modern sacred art; its consecration in 1950 caused much consternation within the ranks of the clergy of France, who had hitherto been accustomed to more traditionally classical structures.
On June 11, 2004, Notre-Dame de Toute Grâce du Plateau d'Assy was classed as a "monument historique de France".
History.
Before World War II, the plateau d'Assy was known as a spa area, and was especially popular with sufferers of tuberculosis. At one point close to twenty sanatoriums could be found in the area. Some of these were equipped with small chapels, while others were visited by chaplains who catered to the sick. There was, however, no church for the area.
In 1935, Jean Devémy, then serving as chaplain to the sanatorium of Sancellemoz, hit upon the idea of building a church dedicated to serving not only the sick of the spas, but also the personnel who worked at them. With the blessing of the bishop of Annecy, Florent du Bois de la Villerabel, he decided to hold an architectural contest to design the new structure. The contest took place in 1937, and was won by the young architect Maurice Novarina. Novarina's plan was to use materials native to the region in the construction of the church; this would include various types of stone - including slate - and wood. The work would be given to local concerns. Construction began in 1938 and was for the most part concluded at the start of World War II.
Even as the church was being erected, Devémy was considering ways of decorating the new building. While he was considering his options, his friend, the artist and Dominican Marie-Alain Couturier, invited him to Paris to visit an art exhibition. Devémy was greatly taken with a stained glass window of Georges Rouault which depicted the Passion of Christ. Supposedly, when he measured the windows of the church upon his return, the Rouault window was found to be an exact fit for the structure. Devémy referred to this incident as the "miracle of Assy".
Notre-Dame de Toute Grâce du Plateau d'Assy was formally blessed in 1941; in that same year the crypt was opened for services.
Design.
Architecture.
In collaboration with Édouard Malot, Novarina designed a church to be built out of local stone, called Taveyannaz sandstone; it is the same type of stone frequently used to build chalets in the Savoie. The roof is pointed, and is meant to sustain large amounts of snow; the foundation of the structure is solidly anchored in the soil. The church is topped by a massive twenty-eight-metre bell tower, carefully designed to withstand local tectonic movements. Eight massive pillars support a hood to a depth of five metres. The interior of the building is meant to resemble a Roman chapel, with a rectangular nave flanked by two aisles. The choir is semicircular, surrounded by an ambulatory and sitting above the crypt. Arcades mounted on monolithic pillars separate different portions of the structure.
Decorative scheme.
The church is best known for its rich interior decoration, which Devémy commissioned from some of the most famous artists of the first half of the twentieth century; consequently, its interior scheme has been said to serve as a microcosm of early modernism and of the era's changing conception of sacred art. Devémy was able to contact many of the artists through Father Couturier, and most who were asked accepted with enthusiasm. Among those who contributed paintings, sculptures, tapestries, stained glass, ceramics, and mosaics to the church were Pierre Bonnard, Fernand Léger, Jean Lurçat, his student Paul Cosandier, Germaine Richier, Georges Rouault, Jean Bazaine, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque, Jacques Lipchitz, Marc Chagall, Constant Demaison, Ladislas Kijno, Claude Mary, Carlo Sergio Signori, and Théodore Strawinsky. The artists were chosen for their skill and not for their religious bent; this was a hallmark of Couturier's manner of thinking about religious art.

Moritz von Bethmann

Philipp Heinrich Moritz Alexander von Bethmann (from 1854: Freiherr von Bethmann), born 8 October 1811 in Frankfurt am Main, died 2 December 1877 in Frankfurt am Main, was a German banker.
Life.
The oldest son of Simon Moritz von Bethmann (1768-1826) and "Louise Friederike née Boode" was only 15 years old when his father died. In 1833 he became the head of the "Gebrüder Bethmann" bank. Von Bethmann focused especially on railway construction. Together with the House of Rothschild, he established three railroad companies in succession: Taunus-Eisenbahn AG in 1836, Frankfurt-Hanauer Eisenbahn in 1844, and the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Nordbahn. In the 1850s he also invested in (among others) the Italian central railroad company, the Austrian state-controlled railroad company, and the Rhein-Nahe-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft.
From 1854 until the loss of Frankfurt's status as a Free City in 1866, von Bethmann was the Prussian consul general in Frankfurt. In 1854 he was elevated to the status of a Freiherr in the Grand Duchy of Baden.
In 1863 he hosted the assembly of German princes in his garden house. Like his father before him, he generously contributed to philanthropic causes and to the arts in Frankfurt.
Von Bethmann, who had to cope with a lifelong handicap due to a hip impediment, was married to "Maria née Freiin von Bose" (1819–1882), with whom he had two sons and three daughters, among them "Ludwig Simon Moritz Freiherr von Bethmann", who was named after his grandfather "Simon Moritz" and who would later take the reins as the head of the House of Bethmann.

Tangent circles

In geometry, tangent circles (also known as kissing circles) are circles in a common plane that intersect in a single point. There are two types of tangency: internal and external. Many problems and constructions in geometry are related to tangent circles; such problems often have real-life applications such as trilateration and maximizing the use of materials. 
Three given circles: Apollonius' problem.
Apollonius' problem is to construct circles that are tangent to three given circles.
Apollonian gasket.
If a circle is iteratively inscribed into the interstital curved triangles between three mutually tangent circles, an Apollonian gasket results, one of the earliest fractals described in print.
Malfatti's problem.
Malfatti's problem is to carve three cylinders from a triangular block of marble, using as much of the marble as possible. In 1803, Gian Francesco Malfatti conjectured that the solution would be obtained by inscribing three mutually tangent circles into the triangle (a problem that had previously been considered by Japanese mathematician Ajima Naonobu); these circles are now known as the Malfatti circles, although the conjecture has been proven to be false.
Six circles theorem.
A chain of six circles can be drawn such that each circle is tangent to two sides of a given triangle and also to the preceding circle in the chain. The chain closes; the sixth circle is always tangent to the first circle.
Generalizations.
Problems involving tangent circles are often generalized to spheres. For example, the Fermat problem of finding sphere(s) tangent to four given spheres is a generalization of Apollonius' problem, whereas Soddy's hexlet is a generalization of a Steiner chain.

<doc id="19349161" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19349161" title="Cambrian explosion">
Cambrian explosion

The Cambrian explosion, or Cambrian radiation, was the relatively rapid appearance, around , of most major animal phyla, as demonstrated in the fossil record. This was accompanied by major diversification of other organisms. Before about , most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies. Over the following 70 or 80 million years, the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today. Ancestors of many of the present phyla appeared during this period, with the exception of Bryozoa, which made its earliest known appearance in the Lower Ordovician.
The Cambrian explosion has generated extensive scientific debate. The seemingly rapid appearance of fossils in the “Primordial Strata” was noted as early as the 1840s, and in 1859 Charles Darwin discussed it as one of the main objections that could be made against his theory of evolution by natural selection. The long-running puzzlement about the appearance of the Cambrian fauna, seemingly abruptly and from nowhere, centers on three key points: whether there really was a mass diversification of complex organisms over a relatively short period of time during the early Cambrian; what might have caused such rapid change; and what it would imply about the origin and evolution of animals. Interpretation is difficult due to a limited supply of evidence, based mainly on an incomplete fossil record and chemical signatures remaining in Cambrian rocks.
Phylogenetic analysis has supported the view that during the Cambrian radiation metazoa evolved monophyletically from a single common ancestor, flagellated colonial protists similar to modern choanoflagellates.
History and significance.
Geologists as long ago as William Buckland (1784–1856) realised that a dramatic step-change in the fossil record occurred around the base of what we now call the Cambrian. By 1859, leading geologists including Roderick Murchison were convinced that what was then called the lowest Silurian stratum showed the origin of life on Earth, though others including Charles Lyell differed. Charles Darwin considered this sudden appearance of many animal groups with no known antecedents to be the gravest single objection to his theory of evolution. In "On the Origin of Species", he reasoned that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but that their fossils had not been found due to the imperfections of the fossil record.
American paleontologist Charles Walcott, who discovered the Burgess Shale, proposed that an interval of time, the “Lipalian”, was not represented in the fossil record or did not preserve fossils, and that the ancestors of the Cambrian animals evolved during this time.
More recently, it was discovered that the history of life on earth goes back at least : Rocks of that age at Warrawoona in Australia contain fossils of stromatolites, stubby pillars that are formed by colonies of Microorganisms. Fossils ("Grypania") of more complex eukaryotic cells, from which all animals, plants and fungi are built, have been found in rocks from , in China and Montana. Rocks dating from contain fossils of the Ediacara biota, organisms so large that they must have been multi-celled, but very unlike any modern organism. In 1948, P. E. Cloud argued that there was a period of "eruptive" evolution in the Early Cambrian, but as recently as the 1970s there was no sign of how the "relatively" modern-looking organisms of the Middle and Late Cambrian arose.
The intense modern interest in this "Cambrian explosion" was sparked by the work of Harry B. Whittington and colleagues, who, in the 1970s, re-analysed many fossils from the Burgess Shale (see below) and concluded that several were complex, but different from any living animals. The most common organism, "Marrella", was clearly an arthropod, but not a member of any known arthropod class. Organisms such as the five-eyed "Opabinia" and spiny slug-like "Wiwaxia" were so different from anything else known that Whittington's team assumed they must represent different phyla, only distantly related to anything known today. Stephen Jay Gould’s popular 1989 account of this work, "Wonderful Life", brought the matter into the public eye and raised questions about what the explosion represented. While differing significantly in details, both Whittington and Gould proposed that all modern animal phyla had appeared rather suddenly. This view was influenced by the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which Eldredge and Gould developed in the early 1970s and which views evolution as long intervals of near-stasis "punctuated" by short periods of rapid change.
Other analyses, some more recent and some dating back to the 1970s, argue that complex animals similar to modern types evolved well before the start of the Cambrian. There has also been intense debate as to whether there was a genuine "explosion" of modern forms in the Cambrian and, if so, to what extent, how and why it happened then.
Types of evidence.
Deducing the events of five hundred million years ago is difficult, as evidence comes exclusively from biological and chemical signatures in rocks and very sparse fossils.
Dating the Cambrian.
Radiometric dates for much of the Cambrian, obtained by detailed analysis of radioactive elements contained within rocks, have only rather recently become available, and for only a few regions.
Relative dating ("A" was before "B") is often sufficient for studying processes of evolution, but this too has been difficult, because of the problems involved in matching up rocks of the same age across different continents.
Therefore dates or descriptions of sequences of events should be regarded with some caution until better data become available.
Body fossils.
Fossils of organisms' bodies are usually the most informative type of evidence. Fossilization is a rare event, and most fossils are destroyed by erosion or metamorphism before they can be observed. Hence the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so as earlier times are considered. Despite this, they are often adequate to illustrate the broader patterns of life's history. There are also biases in the fossil record: different environments are more favourable to the preservation of different types of organism or parts of organisms. Further, only the parts of organisms that were already mineralised are usually preserved, such as the shells of molluscs. Since most animal species are soft-bodied, they decay before they can become fossilised. As a result, although there are 30-plus phyla of living animals, two-thirds have never been found as fossils.
The Cambrian fossil record includes an unusually high number of lagerstätten, which preserve soft tissues. These allow paleontologists to examine the internal anatomy of animals, which in other sediments are only represented by shells, spines, claws, etc. – if they are preserved at all. The most significant Cambrian lagerstätten are the early Cambrian Maotianshan shale beds of Chengjiang (Yunnan, China) and Sirius Passet (Greenland); the middle Cambrian Burgess Shale (British Columbia, Canada); and the late Cambrian Orsten (Sweden) fossil beds.
While lagerstätten preserve far more than the conventional fossil record, they are far from complete. Because lagerstätten are restricted to a narrow range of environments (where soft-bodied organisms can be preserved very quickly, e.g. by mudslides), most animals are probably not represented; further, the exceptional conditions that create lagerstätten probably do not represent normal living conditions. In addition, the known Cambrian lagerstätten are rare and difficult to date, while Precambrian lagerstätten have yet to be studied in detail.
The sparseness of the fossil record means that organisms usually exist long before they are found in the fossil record – this is known as the Signor–Lipps effect.
Trace fossils.
Trace fossils consist mainly of tracks and burrows, but also include coprolites (fossil feces) and marks left by feeding. Trace fossils are particularly significant because they represent a data source that is not limited to animals with easily fossilized hard parts, and reflects organisms' behaviour. Also, many traces date from significantly earlier than the body fossils of animals that are thought to have been capable of making them. While exact assignment of trace fossils to their makers is generally impossible, traces may, for example, provide the earliest physical evidence of the appearance of moderately complex animals (comparable to earthworms).
Geochemical observations.
Several chemical markers indicate a drastic change in the environment around the start of the Cambrian. The markers are consistent with a mass extinction, or with a massive warming resulting from the release of methane ice.
Such changes may reflect a cause of the Cambrian explosion, although they may also have resulted from an increased level of biological activity – a possible result of the explosion. Despite these uncertainties, the geochemical evidence helps by making scientists focus on theories that are consistent with at least one of the likely environmental changes.
Phylogenetic techniques.
Cladistics is a technique for working out the “family tree” of a set of organisms. It works by the logic that, if groups B and C have more similarities to each other than either has to group A, then B and C are more closely related to each other than either is to A. Characteristics that are compared may be anatomical, such as the presence of a notochord, or molecular, by comparing sequences of DNA or protein. The result of a successful analysis is a hierarchy of clades – groups whose members are believed to share a common ancestor. The cladistic technique is sometimes problematic, as some features, such as wings or camera eyes, evolved more than once, convergently – this must be taken into account in analyses.
From the relationships, it may be possible to constrain the date that lineages first appeared. For instance, if fossils of B or C date to X million years ago and the calculated "family tree" says A was an ancestor of B and C, then A must have evolved more than X million years ago.
It is also possible to estimate how long ago two living clades diverged – i.e. approximately how long ago their last common ancestor must have lived  – by assuming that DNA mutations accumulate at a constant rate. These "molecular clocks", however, are fallible, and provide only a very approximate timing: they are not sufficiently precise and reliable for estimating when the groups that feature in the Cambrian explosion first evolved, and estimates produced by different techniques vary by a factor of two. However, the clocks can give an indication of branching rate, and when combined with the constraints of the fossil record, recent clocks suggest a sustained period of diversification through the Ediacaran and Cambrian.
Explanation of key scientific terms.
A phylum is the highest level in the Linnean system for classifying organisms. Phyla can be thought of as groupings of animals based on general body plan. Despite the seemingly different "external" appearances of organisms, they are classified into phyla based on their "internal" and developmental organizations. For example, despite their obvious differences, spiders and barnacles both belong to the phylum Arthropoda; but earthworms and tapeworms, although similar in shape, belong to different phyla.
A phylum is not a fundamental division of nature, such as the difference between electrons and protons. It is simply a very high-level grouping in a classification system created to describe all currently living organisms. This system is imperfect, even for modern animals: different books quote different numbers of phyla, mainly because they disagree about the classification of a huge number of worm-like species. As it is based on living organisms, it accommodates extinct organisms poorly, if at all.
The concept of stem groups was introduced to cover evolutionary "aunts" and "cousins" of living groups. A crown group is a group of closely related living animals plus their last common ancestor plus all its descendants. A stem group is a set of offshoots from the lineage at a point earlier than the last common ancestor of the crown group; it is a "relative" concept, for example tardigrades are living animals that form a crown group in their own right, but Budd (1996) regarded them as also being a stem group relative to the arthropods.
Triploblastic means consisting of 3 layers, which are formed in the embryo, quite early in the animal's development from a single-celled egg to a larva or juvenile form. The innermost layer forms the digestive tract (gut); the outermost forms skin; and the middle one forms muscles and all the internal organs except the digestive system. Most types of living animal are triploblastic – the best-known exceptions are Porifera (sponges) and Cnidaria (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.).
The bilaterians are animals that have right and left sides at some point in their life history. This implies that they have top and bottom surfaces and, importantly, distinct front and back ends. All known bilaterian animals are triploblastic, and all known triploblastic animals are bilaterian. Living Echinoderms (sea stars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, etc.) "look" radially symmetrical (like wheels) rather than bilaterian, but their larvae exhibit bilateral symmetry and some of the earliest echinoderms may have been bilaterally symmetrical. Porifera and Cnidaria are radially symmetrical, non-bilaterian and non-triploblastic.
Coelomate means having a body cavity (coelom) containing the internal organs. Most of the phyla featured in the debate about the Cambrian explosion are coelomates: arthropods, annelid worms, molluscs, echinoderms and chordates – the non-coelomate priapulids are an important exception. All known coelomate animals are triploblastic bilaterians, but some triploblastic bilaterian animals do not have a coelom – for example flatworms, whose organs are surrounded by unspecialized tissues.
Precambrian life.
Our understanding of the Cambrian explosion relies upon knowing what was there beforehand – did the event herald the sudden appearance of a wide range of animals and behaviours, or did such things exist beforehand?
Evidence of animals around 1 billion years ago.
Changes in the abundance and diversity of some types of fossil have been interpreted as evidence for "attacks" by animals or other organisms. Stromatolites, stubby pillars built by colonies of microorganisms, are a major constituent of the fossil record from about , but their abundance and diversity declined steeply after about . This decline has been attributed to disruption by grazing and burrowing animals.
Precambrian marine diversity was dominated by small fossils known as acritarchs. This term describes almost any small organic walled fossil – from the egg cases of small metazoans to resting cysts of many different kinds of green algae. After appearing around , acritarchs underwent a boom around , increasing in abundance, diversity, size, complexity of shape and especially size and number of spines. Their increasingly spiny forms in the last 1 billion years may indicate an increased need for defence against predation. Other groups of small organisms from the Neoproterozoic era also show signs of anti-predator defenses. A consideration of taxon longevity appears to support an increase in predation pressure around this time.
However, in general, the rate of evolution in the Precambrian was very slow, with many cyanobacterial species persisting unchanged for billions of years.
If these predatory organisms really were metazoans, this means that Cambrian animals did not appear "from nowhere" at the base of the Cambrian; their predecessors had existed for hundreds of millions of years.
Fossils of the Doushantuo formation.
The Doushantuo formation harbours microscopic fossils that may represent early bilaterians. Some have been described as animal embryos and eggs, although some of these may represent the remains of giant bacteria.
Another fossil, "Vernanimalcula", has been interpreted as a coelomate bilaterian,
but may simply be an infilled bubble.
These fossils form the earliest hard-and-fast evidence of animals, as opposed to other predators.
Burrows.
The traces of organisms moving on and directly underneath the microbial mats that covered the Ediacaran sea floor are preserved from the Ediacaran period, about . They were probably made by organisms resembling earthworms in shape, size, and how they moved. The burrow-makers have never been found preserved, but, because they would need a head and a tail, the burrowers probably had bilateral symmetry – which would in all probability make them bilaterian animals. They fed above the sediment surface, but were forced to burrow to avoid predators.
Around the start of the Cambrian (about ), many new types of traces first appear, including well-known vertical burrows such as "Diplocraterion" and "Skolithos", and traces normally attributed to arthropods, such as "Cruziana" and "Rusophycus". The vertical burrows indicate that worm-like animals acquired new behaviours, and possibly new physical capabilities. Some Cambrian trace fossils indicate that their makers possessed hard exoskeletons, although they were not necessarily mineralised.
Burrows provide firm evidence of complex organisms; they are also much more readily preserved than body fossils, to the extent that the absence of trace fossils has been used to imply the genuine absence of large, motile bottom-dwelling organisms. They provide a further line of evidence to show that the Cambrian explosion represents a real diversification, and is not a preservational artefact.
Indeed, as burrowing became established, it allowed an explosion of its own, for as burrowers disturbed the sea floor, they aerated it, mixing oxygen into the toxic muds. This made the bottom sediments more hospitable, and allowed a wider range of organisms to inhabit them – creating new niches and the scope for higher diversity.
Ediacaran organisms.
At the start of the Ediacaran period, much of the acritarch fauna, which had remained relatively unchanged for hundreds of millions of years, became extinct, to be replaced with a range of new, larger species, which would prove far more ephemeral. This radiation, the first in the fossil record, is followed soon after by an array of unfamiliar, large, fossils dubbed the Ediacara biota, which flourished for 40 million years until the start of the Cambrian. Most of this "Ediacara biota" were at least a few centimeters long, significantly larger than any earlier fossils. The organisms form three distinct assemblages, increasing in size and complexity as time progresses.
Many of these organisms were quite unlike anything that appeared before or since, resembling discs, mud-filled bags, or quilted mattresses – one palæontologist proposed that the strangest organisms should be classified as a separate kingdom, Vendozoa.
At least some may have been early forms of the phyla at the heart of the "Cambrian explosion" debate, having been interpreted as early molluscs ("Kimberella"), echinoderms ("Arkarua"); and arthropods ("Spriggina", "Parvancorina"). There is still debate about the classification of these specimens, mainly because the diagnostic features that allow taxonomists to classify more recent organisms, such as similarities to living organisms, are generally absent in the Ediacarans. However, there seems little doubt that "Kimberella" was at least a triploblastic bilaterian animal. These organisms are central to the debate about how abrupt the Cambrian explosion was. If some were early members of the animal phyla seen today, the "explosion" looks a lot less sudden than if all these organisms represent an unrelated "experiment", and were replaced by the animal kingdom fairly soon thereafter (40M years is "soon" by evolutionary and geological standards).
Ediacaran–Early Cambrian skeletonization.
The first Ediacaran and lowest Cambrian (Nemakit-Daldynian) skeletal fossils represent tubes and problematic sponge spicules. The oldest sponge spicules are monaxon siliceous, aged around , known from the Doushantou Formation in China and from deposits of the same age in Mongolia, although the interpretation of these fossils as spicules has been challenged. In the late Ediacaran-lowest Cambrian, numerous tube dwellings of enigmatic organisms appeared. It was organic-walled tubes (e.g. "Saarina") and chitinous tubes of the sabelliditids (e.g. "Sokoloviina", "Sabellidites", "Paleolina") that prospered up to the beginning of the Tommotian. The mineralized tubes of "Cloudina", "Namacalathus", "Sinotubulites" and a dozen more of the other organisms from carbonate rocks formed near the end of the Ediacaran period from , as well as the triradially symmetrical mineralized tubes of anabaritids (e.g. "Anabarites", "Cambrotubulus") from uppermost Ediacaran and lower Cambrian. It is interesting to notice that Ediacaran mineralized tubes are often found in carbonates of the stromatolite reefs and thrombolites, i.e. they could live in an environment adverse to the majority of animals.
Although they are as hard to classify as most other Ediacaran organisms, they are important in two other ways. First, they are the earliest known calcifying organisms (organisms that built shells out of calcium carbonate). Secondly, these tubes are a device to rise over a substrate and competitors for effective feeding and, to a lesser degree, they serve as armor for protection against predators and adverse conditions of environment. Some "Cloudina" fossils show small holes in shells. It is possible that the holes are evidence of boring by predators sufficiently advanced to penetrate shells. A possible "evolutionary arms race" between predators and prey is one of the hypotheses that attempt to explain the Cambrian explosion.
In the lowest Cambrian, the stromatolites were decimated. This allowed animals to begin colonization of warm-water pools with carbonate sedimentation. At first, it was anabaritids and "Protohertzina" (the fossilized grasping spines of chaetognaths) fossils. Such mineral skeletons as shells, sclerites, thorns and plates appeared in uppermost Nemakit-Daldynian; they were the earliest species of halkierids, gastropods, hyoliths and other rare organisms. The beginning of the Tommotian has historically been understood to mark an explosive increase of the number and variety of fossils of molluscs, hyoliths and sponges, along with a rich complex of skeletal elements of unknown animals, the first archaeocyathids, brachiopods, tommotiids and others. This sudden increase is partially an artefact of missing strata at the Tommotian type section, and most of this fauna in fact began to diversify in a series of pulses through the Nemakit-Daldynian and into the Tommotian.
Some animals may already have had sclerites, thorns and plates in the Ediacaran (e.g. "Kimberella" had hard sclerites, probably of carbonate), but thin carbonate skeletons cannot be fossilized in siliciclastic deposits. Older (~750 Ma) fossils indicate that mineralization long preceded the Cambrian, probably defending small photosynthetic algae from single-celled eukaryotic predators.
Cambrian life.
Trace fossils.
Trace fossils (burrows etc.) are a reliable indicator of what life was around, and indicate a diversification of life around the start of the Cambrian, with the freshwater realm colonized by animals almost as quickly as the oceans.
Small shelly fauna.
Fossils known as “small shelly fauna” have been found in many parts on the world, and date from just before the Cambrian to about 10 million years after the start of the Cambrian (the Nemakit-Daldynian and Tommotian ages; see timeline). These are a very mixed collection of fossils: spines, sclerites (armor plates), tubes, archeocyathids (sponge-like animals) and small shells very like those of brachiopods and snail-like molluscs – but all tiny, mostly 1 to 2 mm long.
While small, these fossils are far more common than complete fossils of the organisms that produced them; crucially, they cover the window from the start of the Cambrian to the first lagerstatten: a period of time that is otherwise lacking in fossils. Hence, they supplement the conventional fossil record, and allow the fossil ranges of many groups to be extended.
Early Cambrian trilobites and echinoderms.
The earliest trilobite fossils are about 530 million years old, but the class was already quite diverse and worldwide, suggesting that they had been around for quite some time.
It is important to remember that the fossil record of trilobites begins with the appearance of trilobites with mineral exoskeletons – not from the time of their origin.
The earliest generally accepted echinoderm fossils appeared a little bit later, in the Late Atdabanian; unlike modern echinoderms, these early Cambrian echinoderms were not all radially symmetrical.
These provide firm data points for the "end" of the explosion, or at least indications that the crown groups of modern phyla were represented.
Burgess shale type faunas.
The Burgess shale and similar lagerstatten preserve the soft parts of organisms, which provides a wealth of data to aid in the classification of enigmatic fossils. It often preserved complete specimens of organisms only otherwise known from dispersed parts, such as loose scales or isolated mouthparts. Further, the majority of organisms and taxa in these horizons are entirely soft bodied – hence absent from the rest of the fossil record. Since a large part of the ecosystem is preserved, the ecology of the community can also be tentatively reconstructed.
However, the assemblages may represent a "museum": a deep water ecosystem that is evolutionarily "behind" the rapidly diversifying faunas of shallower waters.
Because the lagerstatten provide a mode and quality of preservation that's virtually absent outside of the Cambrian, lots of organisms appear completely different to anything known from the conventional fossil record. This led early workers in the field to attempt to shoehorn the organisms into extant phyla; the shortcomings of this approach led later workers to erect a multitude of new phyla to accommodate all the oddballs. It has since been realised that most oddballs diverged from lineages before they established the phyla we know today – slightly different designs, which were fated to perish rather than flourish into phyla, as their cousin lineages did.
The preservational mode is rare in the preceding Ediacaran period, but those assemblages known show no trace of animal life – perhaps implying a genuine absence of macroscopic metazoans.
Early Cambrian crustaceans.
Crustaceans, one of the four great modern groups of arthropods, are very rare throughout the Cambrian. Convincing crustaceans were once thought to be common in Burgess shale-type biotas, but none of these individuals can be shown to fall into the crown group of "true crustaceans". The Cambrian record of crown group crustaceans comes from microfossils. The Swedish Orsten horizons contain later Cambrian crustacea, but only organisms smaller than 2 mm are preserved. This restricts the data set to juveniles and miniaturised adults.
A more informative data source is the organic microfossils of the Mount Cap formation, Mackenzie Mountains, Canada. This late Early Cambrian assemblage () consists of microscopic fragments of arthropods' cuticle, which is left behind when the rock is dissolved with hydrofluoric acid. The diversity of this assemblage is similar to that of modern crustacean faunas. Most interestingly, analysis of fragments of feeding machinery found in the formation shows that it was adapted to feed in a very precise and refined fashion. This contrasts with most other early Cambrian arthropods, which fed messily by shovelling anything they could get their feeding appendages on into their mouths. This sophisticated and specialised feeding machinery belonged to a large (~30 cm) organism, and would have provided great potential for diversification: specialised feeding apparatus allows a number of different approaches to feeding and development, and creates a number of different approaches to avoid being eaten.
Early Ordovician radiation.
After an extinction at the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary, another radiation occurred, which established the taxa that would dominate the Palaeozoic.
During this radiation, the total number of orders doubled, and families tripled, increasing marine diversity to levels typical of the Palaeozoic, and disparity to levels approximately equivalent to today's.
How real was the explosion?
The fossil record as Darwin knew it seemed to suggest that the major metazoan groups appeared in a few million years of the early to mid-Cambrian, and even in the 1980s this still appeared to be the case.
However, evidence of Precambrian metazoa is gradually accumulating. If the Ediacaran "Kimberella" was a mollusc-like protostome (one of the two main groups of coelomates), the protostome and deuterostome lineages must have split significantly before (deuterostomes are the other main group of coelomates). Even if it is not a protostome, it is widely accepted as a bilaterian. Since fossils of rather modern-looking Cnidarians (jellyfish-like organisms) have been found in the Doushantuo lagerstätte, the Cnidarian and bilaterian lineages must have diverged well over .
Trace fossils and predatory borings in "Cloudina" shells provide further evidence of Ediacaran animals. Some fossils from the Doushantuo formation have been interpreted as embryos and one ("Vernanimalcula") as a bilaterian coelomate, although these interpretations are not universally accepted. Earlier still, predatory pressure has acted on stromatolites and acritarchs since around .
The presence of Precambrian animals somewhat dampens the "bang" of the explosion: not only was the appearance of animals gradual, but their evolutionary radiation ("diversification") may also not have been as rapid as once thought. Indeed, statistical analysis shows that the Cambrian explosion was no faster than any of the other radiations in animals' history. However, it does seem that some innovations linked to the explosion – such as resistant armour – only evolved once in the animal lineage; this makes a lengthy Precambrian animal lineage harder to defend. Further, the conventional view that all the phyla arose in the Cambrian is flawed; while the phyla may have diversified in this time period, representatives of the crown-groups of many phyla do not appear until much later in the Phanerozoic. Further, the mineralized phyla that form the basis of the fossil record may not be representative of other phyla, since most mineralized phyla originated in a benthic setting. The fossil record is consistent with a Cambrian Explosion that was limited to the benthos, with pelagic phyla evolving much later.
Ecological complexity among marine animals increased in the Cambrian, as well later in the Ordovician. However, recent research has overthrown the once-popular idea that disparity was exceptionally high throughout the Cambrian, before subsequently decreasing. In fact, disparity remains relatively low throughout the Cambrian, with modern levels of disparity only attained after the early Ordovician radiation.
The diversity of many Cambrian assemblages is similar to today's, and at a high (class/phylum) level, diversity is thought by some to have risen relatively smoothly through the Cambrian, stabilizing somewhat in the Ordovician. This interpretation, however, glosses over the astonishing and fundamental pattern of basal polytomy and phylogenetic telescoping at or near the Cambrian boundary, as seen in most major animal lineages. Thus Harry Blackmore Whittington's questions regarding the abrupt nature of the Cambrian explosion remain, and have yet to be satisfactorily answered.
Possible causes of the “explosion”.
Despite the evidence that moderately complex animals (triploblastic bilaterians) existed before and possibly long before the start of the Cambrian, it seems that the pace of evolution was exceptionally fast in the early Cambrian. Possible explanations for this fall into three broad categories: environmental, developmental, and ecological changes. Any explanation must explain the timing and magnitude of the explosion.
Changes in the environment.
Ozone formation.
The amount of ozone required to shield Earth from biologically lethal UV radiation, wavelengths from 200 to 300 nanometers (nm), is believed to have been in existence around the Cambrian Explosion. The presence of the ozone formation enables the development of complex life and life on land, as opposed to life being restricted in the water.
Increase in oxygen levels.
Earth’s earliest atmosphere contained no free oxygen; the oxygen that animals breathe today, both in the air and dissolved in water, is the product of billions of years of photosynthesis. As a general trend, the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere has risen gradually over about the last 2.5 billion years.
The shortage of oxygen might well have prevented the rise of large, complex animals. The amount of oxygen an animal can absorb is largely determined by the area of its oxygen-absorbing surfaces (lungs and gills in the most complex animals; the skin in less complex ones); but, the amount needed is determined by its volume, which grows faster than the oxygen-absorbing area if an animal’s size increases equally in all directions. An increase in the concentration of oxygen in air or water would increase the size to which an organism could grow without its tissues becoming starved of oxygen. However, members of the Ediacara biota reached metres in length tens of millions of years before the Cambrian explosion. Other metabolic functions may have been inhibited by lack of oxygen, for example the construction of tissue such as collagen, required for the construction of complex structures, or to form molecules for the construction of a hard exoskeleton. However, animals are not affected when similar oceanographic conditions occur in the Phanerozoic; there is no convincing correlation between oxygen levels and evolution, so oxygen may have been no more a prerequisite to complex life than liquid water or primary productivity.
Snowball Earth.
In the late Neoproterozoic (extending into the early Ediacaran period), the Earth suffered massive glaciations in which most of its surface was covered by ice. This may have caused a mass extinction, creating a genetic bottleneck; the resulting diversification may have given rise to the Ediacara biota, which appears soon after the last "Snowball Earth" episode.
However, the snowball episodes occurred a long time before the start of the Cambrian, and it is hard to see how so much diversity could have been caused by even a series of bottlenecks; the cold periods may even have "delayed" the evolution of large size organisms.
Increase in the calcium concentration of the Cambrian seawater.
Newer research suggests that volcanically active midocean ridges caused a massive and sudden surge of the calcium concentration in the oceans, making it possible for marine organisms to build skeletons and hard body parts.
Alternatively a high influx of ions could have been provided by the widespread erosion that produced Powell's Great Unconformity.
Developmental explanations.
A range of theories are based on the concept that minor modifications to animals' development as they grow from embryo to adult may have been able to cause very large changes in the final adult form. The Hox genes, for example, control which organs individual regions of an embryo will develop into. For instance, if a certain Hox gene is expressed, a region will develop into a limb; if a different Hox gene is expressed in that region (a minor change), it could develop into an eye instead (a phenotypically major change).
Such a system allows a large range of disparity to appear from a limited set of genes, but such theories linking this with the explosion struggle to explain why the origin of such a development system should by itself lead to increased diversity or disparity. Evidence of Precambrian metazoans combines with molecular data to show that much of the genetic architecture that could feasibly have played a role in the explosion was already well established by the Cambrian.
This apparent paradox is addressed in a theory that focuses on the physics of development. It is proposed that the emergence of simple multicellular forms provided a changed context and spatial scale in which novel physical processes and effects were mobilized by the products of genes that had previously evolved to serve unicellular functions. Morphological complexity (layers, segments, lumens, appendages) arose, in this view, by self-organization.
Ecological explanations.
These focus on the interactions between different types of organism. Some of these hypotheses deal with changes in the food chain; some suggest arms races between predators and prey, and others focus on the more general mechanisms of coevolution. Such theories are well suited to explaining why there was a rapid increase in both disparity and diversity, but they must explain why the "explosion" happened when it did.
End-Ediacaran mass extinction.
Evidence for such an extinction includes the disappearance from the fossil record of the Ediacara biota and shelly fossils such as "Cloudina", and the accompanying perturbation in the record.
Mass extinctions are often followed by adaptive radiations as existing clades expand to occupy the ecospace emptied by the extinction. However, once the dust had settled, overall disparity and diversity returned to the pre-extinction level in each of the Phanerozoic extinctions.
Evolution of eyes.
Andrew Parker has proposed that predator-prey relationships changed dramatically after eyesight evolved. Prior to that time, hunting and evading were both close-range affairs – smell, vibration, and touch were the only senses used. When predators could see their prey from a distance, new defensive strategies were needed. Armor, spines, and similar defenses may also have evolved in response to vision. He further observed that, where animals lose vision in unlighted environments such as caves, diversity of animal forms tends to decrease. Nevertheless, many scientists doubt that vision could have caused the explosion. Eyes may well have evolved long before the start of the Cambrian. It is also difficult to understand why the evolution of eyesight would have caused an explosion, since other senses, such as smell and pressure detection, can detect things at a greater distance in the sea than sight can; but the appearance of these other senses apparently did not cause an evolutionary explosion.
Arms races between predators and prey.
The ability to avoid or recover from predation often makes the difference between life and death, and is therefore one of the strongest components of natural selection. The pressure to adapt is stronger on the prey than on the predator: if the predator fails to win a contest, it loses a meal; if the prey is the loser, it loses its life.
But, there is evidence that predation was rife long before the start of the Cambrian, for example in the increasingly spiny forms of acritarchs, the holes drilled in "Cloudina" shells, and traces of burrowing to avoid predators. Hence, it is unlikely that the "appearance" of predation was the trigger for the Cambrian "explosion", although it may well have exhibited a strong influence on the body forms that the "explosion" produced. However, the intensity of predation does appear to have increased dramatically during the Cambrian as new predatory "tactics" (such as shell-crushing) emerged.
Increase in size and diversity of planktonic animals.
Geochemical evidence strongly indicates that the total mass of plankton has been similar to modern levels since early in the Proterozoic. Before the start of the Cambrian, their corpses and droppings were too small to fall quickly towards the seabed, since their drag was about the same as their weight. This meant they were destroyed by scavengers or by chemical processes before they reached the sea floor.
Mesozooplankton are plankton of a larger size. Early Cambrian specimens filtered microscopic plankton from the seawater. These larger organisms would have produced droppings and corpses that were large enough to fall fairly quickly. This provided a new supply of energy and nutrients to the mid-levels and bottoms of the seas, which opened up a huge range of new possible ways of life. If any of these remains sank uneaten to the sea floor they could be buried; this would have taken some carbon out of circulation, resulting in an increase in the concentration of breathable oxygen in the seas (carbon readily combines with oxygen).
The initial herbivorous mesozooplankton were probably larvae of benthic (seafloor) animals. A larval stage was probably an evolutionary innovation driven by the increasing level of predation at the seafloor during the Ediacaran period.
Metazoans have an amazing ability to increase diversity through coevolution. This means that an organism's traits can lead to traits evolving in other organisms; a number of responses are possible, and a different species can potentially emerge from each one. As a simple example, the evolution of predation may have caused one organism to develop a defence, while another developed motion to flee. This would cause the predator lineage to split into two species: one that was good at chasing prey, and another that was good at breaking through defences. Actual coevolution is somewhat more subtle, but, in this fashion, great diversity can arise: three quarters of living species are animals, and most of the rest have formed by coevolution with animals.
Ecosystem engineering.
Evolving organisms inevitably change the environment they evolve in. The Devonian colonization of land had planet-wide consequences for sediment cycling and ocean nutrients, and was likely linked to the Devonian mass extinction. A similar process may have occurred on smaller scales in the oceans, with, for example, the sponges filtering particles from the water and depositing them in the mud in a more digestible form; or burrowing organisms making previously unavailable resources available for other organisms.
Discredited hypotheses.
As our understanding of the events of the Cambrian becomes clearer, data has accumulated to make some hypotheses look improbable. Causes that have been proposed, but are now discounted include the evolution of herbivory, vast changes in the speed of tectonic plate movement or of the cyclic changes in the Earth's orbital motion, or the operation of different evolutionary mechanisms from those that are seen in the rest of the Phanerozoic eon.
Complexity threshold.
The explosion may not have been a significant evolutionary event. It may represent a threshold being crossed: for example a threshold in genetic complexity that allowed a vast range of morphological forms to be employed.
Uniqueness of the explosion.
The "Cambrian explosion" can be viewed as two waves of metazoan expansion into empty niches: first, a coevolutionary rise in diversity as animals explored niches on the Ediacaran sea floor, followed by a second expansion in the early Cambrian as they became established in the water column. The rate of diversification seen in the Cambrian phase of the explosion is unparalleled among marine animals: it affected all metazoan clades of which Cambrian fossils have been found. Later radiations, such as those of fish in the Silurian and Devonian periods, involved fewer taxa, mainly with very similar body plans. Although the recovery from the Permian-Triassic extinction started with about as few animal species as the Cambrian explosion, the recovery produced far fewer significantly new types of animals.
Whatever triggered the early Cambrian diversification opened up an exceptionally wide range of previously unavailable ecological niches. When these were all occupied, limited space existed for such wide-ranging diversifications to occur again, because strong competition existed in all niches and incumbents usually had the advantage. If a wide range of empty niches had continued, clades would be able to continue diversifying and become disparate enough for us to recognise them as different phyla; when niches are filled, lineages will continue to resemble one another long after they diverge, as limited opportunity exists for them to change their life-styles and forms.
There were two similar explosions in the evolution of land plants: after a cryptic history beginning about , land plants underwent a uniquely rapid adaptive radiation during the Devonian period, about . Furthermore, Angiosperms (flowering plants) originated and rapidly diversified during the Cretaceous period.

Gazeta Lwowska

Gazeta Lwowska () is a Polish language biweekly magazine, published since 24 December 1990 in Lviv (also known as Lwów, Lvov, etc.), Ukraine. The publication refers to the traditions of a Polish language paper "Gazeta Lwowska", which was published between 1811 and 1944 and as such was one of the oldest Polish newspapers.
Originally, Gazeta Lwowska was a press organ of the Austrian authorities of Galicia and it limited itself to publishing legal announcements. In 1873, when Władysław Łoziński became editor-in-chief, it began inserting local and world news, and since 1874, it published a monthly addition "Przewodnik Naukowy i Literacki" ("Scientific and Literary Guide"), dedicated to history, literature, geography, economics and ethnography. Among writers who cooperated with Gazeta Lwowska, there were Adam Krechowiecki, Ludwik Kubala, Karol Szajnocha, Józef Szujski, Alfred Wysocki.
After 1918, when Lemberg was incorporated into the Second Polish Republic, Gazeta Lwowska was a local daily, popular in the Lwów Voivodeship. Following the joint Nazi and Soviet annexation of Poland, the newspaper stopped publication. It re-established publication briefly from July 1941 to July 1944 during the period of German occupation as vehicle for Nazi propaganda. 
During German occupation, Gazeta Lwowska was very popular among readers, with the circulation reaching 90,000 in August 1943. Known as "Lembergierka", the Gazeta was liked by Polish readers, as it was not as rabidly anti-Polish like the previous, defunct, Soviet-sponsored Czerwony Sztandar (1939–1941). Its editors-in-chief were only Germans, such as Felix Rufenach and A.G. Lehmann. Among Polish employees, a significant number was informally connected with the resistance movement. Gazeta's street vendors organized a patriotic demonstration in Lwów, on 11 November 1943 (Polish independence day). On that day, several copies of the newspaper were stamped with a Polish Eagle, and with an inscription "Poland will triumph". 
Gazeta Lwowska returned on 24 December 1990 as a biweekly, published by the Association of Polish Culture of the Lviv Land ("Towarzystwo Kultury Polskiej Ziemi Lwowskiej" - "TKPZL").

Pescarolo 01

The Pescarolo 01 is the first sports prototype racing car built entirely by French team Pescarolo Sport. It is designed to meet the LMP1 and LMP2 regulations for Le Mans Prototypes in the Le Mans Series as well as at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and replace Pescarolo's previous C60 chassis which had been heavily modified from cars purchased through Courage Compétition. The first 01s debuted at the 2007 1000 km of Monza, and are still used by several teams today.
Development.
At the end of 2006, new regulations came into effect for the various series supported by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO). These regulations required extensive changes to the layout of a chassis, leaving many teams to purchase or build new cars as their current cars would be ineligible in 2007. Pescarolo Sport at the time was campaigning two Pescarolo C60s, cars which Pescarolo Sport had extensively modified from their origins as Courage C60s a few years prior. The C60s however did not meet the 2007 regulations, and team owner Henri Pescarolo chose to become a full constructor for the first time. Many features from the C60 were carried over in the design of the 01.
Unlike the C60, the 01 was intended to be not only used by the Pescarolo Sport team, but also to be sold to customers. In order to broaden their customer base, the 01 was designed to meet the regulations of both the LMP1 and LMP2 classes with minor variation required.
Racing history.
2007.
As the first 01s were being completed, several teams announced their intent to purchase the chassis. British team Rollcentre Racing chose to re-enter the LMP1 category and campaign an 01-Judd alongside the two Pescarolo Sport cars. The German Kruse Motorsports team were the first to purchase an LMP2-spec car, using the smaller Judd V8 as a powerplant. Lister Cars also announced their intentions to purchase a chassis, which they would later modify, to replace their ineligible Storm LMP.
At the Pescarolo 01's debut in the Le Mans Series opener, the #16 car of Pescarolo Sport managed to finish in second place, between the two factory Peugeot diesels, while the #17 car finished fourth. The Rollcentre and Kruse cars also finished the event in points-earning positions. Pescarolo's #16 car earned two further second place finishes over the six race season, and was able to secure second place in the LMP1 Teams Championship. Pescarolo's #17 car struggled to earn points and finished seventh in points, but the Rollcentre team were able to outperform the one factory Pescarolo and finish fourth in the championship. Kruse's season was cut short as a fire on board the team's transporter destroyed their car.
At the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans, Pescarolo Sport was returning as the previous year's runner-up. All four 01s from the Le Mans Series were entered, and three of them were able to successfully reach the finish. The #16 Pescarolo of Emmanuel Collard, Jean-Christophe Boullion, and Romain Dumas was classified third, eleven laps behind the winning Audi, while Rollcentre Racing's car was a further eleven laps behind in fourth place. Pescarolo's #17 car finished well back in 13th, while Kruse's car suffered mechanical problems and retired in the first half of the event.
2008.
For the 2008 season, five Pescarolo 01s would once again be entered in the Le Mans Series. Pescarolo Sport and Rollcentre Racing remained as they had the year before, but two more 01s were entered by the French Saulnier Racing. The team, which had been purchased by Pescarolo Sport at the end of 2007, entered an 01 each in the LMP1 and LMP2 classes.
In the LMP1 category, the four teams faced stiffer competition from not only the returning Peugeots, but also newcomers Audi. Pescarolo Sport finished on the podium twice in five races, once each for the #16 and #17 cars. It was the #16 car which once again led amongst Pescarolos in the Teams Championship, finishing in sixth place, while every other Pescarolo team managed to earn at least a point during the year. In LMP2, the Saulnier car using the latest V8 from Judd had a best finish of second in class at the 1000 km of Nürburgring and successfully finished the year fourth in the Teams Championship, the best non-Porsche in the field.
As in the previous year, the entire contingent of 01s competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and once again nearly all were able to finish. #17 led the 01 field home in seventh place, the best finisher using petrol fuel. Rollcentre's race ended in eleventh place, while the LMP1 Saulnier entry survived for 26th. In LMP2, the Saulnier 01 was third in its class, 21 laps behind the winning Porsche, and ranked eighteenth in the overall standings. Only the #16 Pescarolo, which had earned a podium the previous year, was unable to complete the full race.
2009.
In 2009, Pescarolo Sport and OAK Racing, partnered with Mazda France, competed in the Le Mans Series season, each with two Evo chassis'. Pescarolo Sport #16 finished second in the LMP1 class Teams Championship thirteen points behind AMR Eastern Europe who ran a Lola-Aston Martin B09/60. They ran a #17 car for the first two round before replacing it with the Peugeot. OAK Racing managed sixth and eighth in the LMP2 Teams Championship with eighth place car #35 earning a ten point deduction. The car could have been placed in fourth position if the points deduction was not in place.
Pescarolo Sport competed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with only one car being #16. Their #17 car was be a Peugeot 908 HDi FAP. OAK Racing also campaigned their two LMP2-spec 01's at Le Mans. Pescarolo Sport managed to finish eighth overall and in class among tough opposition which included nine diesel-powered LMP1 cars as well as petrol opposition from Aston Martin Racing and Oreca. OAK Racing car #24 did well in LMP2 finishing third in class and 20th overall. Car #35 retired after 208 laps.
2011.
2011 saw the return of a Pescarolo works team under the form of a new team named Pescarolo Team, succeeding to Pescarolo Sport, being bankrupt in July 2010 after their financial difficulties. Pescarolo Team will be racing in the LMP1 class in the 2011 Le Mans Series season at the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans. OAK Racing will race their own modified version of the 01 with two LMP1 cars and two LMP2 cars. The No. 35 OAK Pescarolo 01 finished third in the LMP2 class at the 2011 12 Hours of Sebring, the other two cars OAK Racing brought along (which were LMP1 cars) both retired, one of which led the race overall for a brief period after a full course caution. Pescarolo Team competed at the 6 Hours of Castellet with one car. Pescarolo's return was a dream comeback as they won overall. The grandfathered V10-powered car finished one lap ahead of second place car with Emmanuel Collard, Christophe Tinseau and Julien Jousse piloting the car.
2012.
For 2012, OAK Racing will continue to run their modified version of the 01 in the LMP1 class for the upcoming 2012 FIA World Endurance Championship season. Their LMP2 car will be renamed the Morgan LMP2 due to OAK's partnership with Morgan Motor Company. Pescarolo Team used the 01 for the last time at the 2012 12 Hours of Sebring (with a 5-liter engine, finishing 6th overall and 3rd among WEC LMP1 teams, behind the two Joest Racing Audi R18 TDIs) before it will be replaced by the Pescarolo 03, a modified version of Aston Martin Racing's AMR One. OAK Racing managed to finish in 2nd in the LMP2-class of Sebring, but experienced a turbulent season and finished 4th in the LMP2 Trophy.
2013.
The OAK-Pescarolo 01 was retired at the beginning of 2013. OAK Racing decided to concentrate on running the Morgan LMP2. The Morgan LMP2, equipped with a Nissan VK45DE engine, enjoyed great success in 2013, winning the LMP2-class of the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans and both the Asian Le Mans Series and World Endurance Championship in the LMP2 category.

Guarded logic

Guarded logic is a choice set of dynamic logic involved in choices, where outcomes are limited. 
A simple example of guarded logic is as follows: if X is true, then Y, else Z can be expressed in dynamic logic as (X?;Y)∪(~X?;Z). This shows a guarded logical choice: if X holds, then X?;Y is equal to Y, and ~X?;Z is blocked, and a ∪block is also equal to Y. Hence, when X is true, the primary performer of the action can only take the Y branch, and when false the Z branch.
A real-world example is the idea of paradox: something cannot be both true and false. A guarded logical choice is one where any change in true affects all decisions made down the line.

Curtis Charles "Curt" Stone (born November 19, 1922) is a retired long-distance runner from the United States. He represented his native country in three consecutive Summer Olympics, starting in 1948. He was born in Brooklyn, Pennsylvania.
Stone was affiliated with Pennsylvania State University. During the 3,000m Steeplechase at the 1951 Pan American Games, Stone was easily ahead but slowed on the final straightaway to allow teammate Browning Ross to catch up. The two crossed the finish line hand in hand forcing a tie for first place. Argentine officials debated whether to disqualify the pair but ultimately let the results stand, ranking Stone as first after a close examination of the finish photograph.

Ron Gorchov

Ron Gorchov (born 1930) is an American artist who has been working with curved surface paintings and shaped canvases since 1967. Gorchov's primary invention consists of finely fitted, curved wooden frames resembling shields or saddles, across which is stretched linen or canvas. He uses simple paired strokes to create images that play with asymmetry within a basically symmetrical design, creating his emblematic doubled or mirrored image.
Gorchov's paintings are included in many prominent collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Detroit Institute of Art, and the Guggenheim.
Biography.
Gorchov's career as an artist began in 1944, at the age of fourteen, when he began taking classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. Many of his fellow students were servicemen returning from World War II who used G.I. Bill benefits to pay for art materials. "A veteran... gave me a paper bag with all his half-squeezed oil paint tubes and a whole bunch of old brushes and he said they'd be good luck.".
Gorchov attended the University of Mississippi in 1947 and called it "the most unlikely place I could go. The deep south was exotic. I went fishing with William Faulkner...but because of the horrific racial problem I was mentally not at all able to think about art." Gorchov returned to Chicago and took both academic and art classes at Roosevelt College and the Art Institute. In 1953, Gorchov came to New York with his wife and newborn son and eighty dollars. The family moved into the Marlton Hotel, across the street from where the Whitney Museum used to be and what is now the New York Studio School.
Gorchov's career has included impressive showings at Susan Caldwell and Pat Hamilton galleries in the 1970s, followed by Hamilton, Marlborough, and Jack Tilton galleries in New York and galerie m in Germany in the 1980s. In 1972, Gorchov installed two of his "experiments in neocontructivism: multipaneled stacks of heraldic monochromes" at the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, New York. One of these stacked works, titled "Set", was later included in "Rooms", the inaugural exhibition at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in New York in 1976, while the other, titled "Entrance," was also exhibited at P.S. 1 in 1979. In 2006 Gorchov's work was again shown at P.S. 1 in a solo show titled "Ron Gorchov: Double Trouble."
Tradition.
Gorchov is sometimes known as a "perennially emerging artist.". His first appearance on the scene was in 1960, when he was included in the Whitney Museum's "Young America 1960: Thirty American Painters Under Thirty-Six" exhibition. Some years later Gorchov was rediscovered by Dorothy Miller, then a curator at MoMA, who chose him for "Art in America"'s "New Talent U.S.A.: Painting."
Gorchov was part of a group of artists working in Manhattan in the 1960s and 70s that was responding to the concept of "Action Painting" as defined by Harold Rosenberg, a concept that purported to demolish pictorial conventions and held as suspect the notions of facility and harmonious composition. His work shows an affinity with that of Arshile Gorky (Gorchov was at one point affiliated with Gorky's mentor John D. Graham), Joel Shapiro and Richard Tuttle. He was a mentor to Willem de Kooning and friendly with Mark Rothko.

Fairfax County Economic Development Authority

The Fairfax County Economic Development Authority (FCEDA) is an independent authority in Fairfax County, Virginia, created under Virginia state law in 1964 and funded by Fairfax County government. The FCEDA exists to promote investment and business growth in Fairfax County in order to expand the commercial tax base. The FCEDA does this by managing marketing programs that encourage businesses to expand or relocate to the county. It is the largest non-state economic development authority in the nation.
In addition to its marketing programs, the FCEDA provides assistance to existing and new Fairfax County businesses by locating office space, providing market information, linking entrepreneurs with potential investors, and providing liaison services between businesses and Fairfax County regulatory agencies.
The FCEDA also offers monthly workshops for entrepreneurs interested in starting or expanding a business in Fairfax County. Other programs target foreign-owned and small, minority- and woman-owned businesses.
The FCEDA’s headquarters are in the Tysons Corner area of Fairfax County, with satellite offices located in Los Angeles, Bangalore, Munich, London, Seoul and Tel Aviv.
Early history.
In 1956 the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors formed an advisory group on economic development called the Industrial Development Commission. This group existed until 1964 when the Virginia General Assembly acted to create the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority. Acting on concerns about population increases and funding of county services, the Board of Supervisors in the late 1970s tasked the FCEDA with its mission to create a business retention and attraction campaign that formed the basis of the EDA’s current programs and purpose.
In his book ""Internet Alley: High Technology in Tysons Corner, 1945-2005,"" (The MIT Press, 2008), Paul E. Ceruzzi summarizes two critical events in the history of Fairfax County economic development: the production of the "Noman Cole Report" and the first salvo in what would become an international advertising strategy executed by the Economic Development Authority.
Ceruzzi explains that in 1976 the newly elected chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, Jack Herrity, commissioned a Blue Ribbon Panel for the purpose of examining the county’s existing ordinances and policies related to industrial development and growth. The panel, named for its chairman, Noman Cole, produced a report entitled the "Committee to Study the Means of Encouraging Industrial Development in Fairfax County."
The Board of Supervisors charged the Economic Development Authority with developing a business attraction and retention program. Earle Williams, one of the contributors to the report, joined the FCEDA Commission around this time and argued for a large increase in the authority’s marketing budget. As part of the marketing strategy, the authority bought a two-page ad in "The Wall Street Journal", the cost of which was beyond anything that group had ever done, as Ceruzzi notes. These early forays into advertising were preludes to what would become a robust global advertising effort that would establish Fairfax County as a "brand" unto itself.
The combined impact of pro-growth policies and the attraction and retention campaign (led by the FCEDA advertising program) would prompt Time magazine columnist Justin Fox in 2007 to call Fairfax County "one of the great economic success stories of our time".
Recent history.
In 2005 Site Selection Magazine named the FCEDA to its list of top economic development groups for the EDA's successful efforts to expand the number of defense contractors and research organizations in the county.
The FCEDA hosted the first National Conference on the Creative Economy, in Tysons Corner, Virginia in October 2007. The conference program included keynote addresses from Richard Florida, Thomas Friedman and Alvin Toffler.
In 2008 the Washington, D.C.-based International Economic Development Council (IEDC), the largest professional association of economic development practitioners in the world, recognized FCEDA with its 2008 Excellence in Economic Development Award for the FCEDA-produced “Power of Ideas” advertising campaign. The FCEDA received honorable mentions in two other IEDC awards categories in 2008: "Technology-Based Economic Development Program" category for localities with more than 200,000 residents and the "Special Event" category for localities with more than 200,000 residents, for the 2007 National Conference on the Creative Economy.
In February, 2009 Hilton Hotels announced it would move its corporate headquarters from Beverly Hills to Fairfax County, Virginia. The Washington Post reported that Hilton Hotels "surprised the local hotel community...by announcing it was moving to the Washington region from Beverly Hills, Fairfax after looking closely at a spot in Montgomery County near Marriott International." Hilton Hotels corporate headquarters are located in Tysons Corner.
On June 18, 2009, the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority (FCEDA) hosted “The New Urban Economic Model: The Transformation of Fairfax County" conference to examine growth in the county, MarketWatch reports. The conference was held at the Hilton McLean Tysons Corner in Fairfax County. As noted by Reuters keynote speakers included:
In August 2010, the Southern Economic Development Council (SEDC, [http://www.sedc.org]) announced that Fairfax County won a 2010 Community Economic Development Award in recognition of its success in business attraction.
In December 2010, FCEDA Gordon was named 2010 Virginia Business Person of the Year by Virginia Business magazine, which cited his role in helping attract major business headquarters to Fairfax, County as a key factor in their decision. Also in December, the FCEDA was cited as the top economic development project in the state when the Virginia Chamber of Commerce awarded the authority its Virginia Torchbearer award.
In November 2011, Bechtel, one of the world's largest engineering, construction and projects management companies, announced that it would relocate its Global Operations headquarters to the Reston area of Fairfax County, creating 625 new jobs.
In February 2012, national commercial real estate firm Transwestern honored Gerald L. Gordon, Ph.D, president and CEO of the FCEDA as the recipient of the “Trendsetter of the Year” award at the 15th annual Washington, D.C. TrendLines event. Transwestern cited Gordon’s “tireless advocacy and steadfast leadership” in promoting Fairfax County as a business location since joining the FCEDA in 1983.
Governance.
The FCEDA operates under the direction of seven commissioners, who are local business people appointed by the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. The commissioners govern and oversee the FCEDA’s policies and programs. Commissioners serve for four-year terms and hire the FCEDA president, who since 1987 has been Gerald L. Gordon, Ph.D.
Gordon is the author of 12 books, his most recent is _The Economic Viability of Micropolitan America_, published by CRC Press(2013). The book is part of CRC's American Society for Public Administration series designed to increase national and international interest for topics in public administration. The Economic Viability of Micropolitan America draws on Dr. Gordon's 30 years of experience as president of the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority, and his involvement in assisting communities around the world.
Research and Conferences.
According to the FCEDA website, the authority conducts research and stages conferences under the moniker Work/Life to “better understand broad workplace trends that impact businesses in Fairfax County and across the country.”
In September 2007, FCEDA commissioned Ipsos, an independent research firm, to undertake a national poll on creativity in the workplace. The poll found that that, while an overwhelming majority of American workers believe they are instinctively creative, fewer than two in three think they are tapping their creative capacities on the job. The results of the national survey were reported on by such publications as the Wall Street Journal, Christian Science Monitor and Washington Post. The poll results were published in advance of the 2007 National Conference on the Creative Economy, a conference presented by the FCEDA.
In October 2008, the FCEDA commissioned a new survey through Ipsos that examined American workers' opinions of technology in the workplace. The survey found that an overwhelming majority of U.S. workers place a high value on technology in the workplace, so much so that almost 40 percent of employees across the labor force would consider changing jobs to work for an organization that is more committed to providing access to and training in the latest technology. Results of the survey were covered by the Associated Press, the Washington Post and the Fox Business Network.
In May 2009, the FCEDA partnered with Ipsos once again. This time, FCEDA chose to examine issues facing communities that, like Fairfax County, after a long period of suburbanization and increased density, are in transition to a more urban environment. The survey revealed that "living or working in the suburbs might not be all that it’s cracked up to be." Of the one in three (32%) Americans who reportedly live in a suburban environment, a majority (51%) wishes their community had more of a wide variety of offerings. The results of survey were released ahead of the FCEDA conference: “The New Urban Economic Model: The Transformation of Fairfax County" and was picked up by the Washington Business Journal, WTOP and WMAL radio. The conference featured keynote addresses by Urban Land Institute Senior Resident Fellow (and former Indianapolis mayor) William Hudnut and Brookings Institution urban policy scholar Anthony Downs.
In Sept. 2012, the FCEDA presented a symposium titled America’s Aging Workforce, which featured talks from industry and government leaders from the Washington, D.C., area and beyond on a variety of topics related to issues and opportunities presented by demographic shifts in the U.S. workforce. According to FCEDA CEO Gerald Gordon, the number of workers 65 and over will increase 75 percent to 70 million in the next 18 years.
Also presented at the conference were results from a survey looking at how younger and older workers view those demographic shifts. Despite the changing demographics, the research found that different generations value each other's contributions, according to Forbes. Presenters at the conference included John Berry, director of the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM); John W. Martin, president and CEO of the Southeaster Institute of Research (SIR), co-founder of the Boomer Project and author of Boomer Consumer; Danny Felty, M.D., a healthy-aging expert at HCA Virginia Health System and executives from Fairfax County companies Capital One, Volkswagen Group of America and Balfour Beatty.

Apsidal precession

In celestial mechanics, perihelion precession, apsidal precession or orbital precession is the precession (rotation) of the orbit of a celestial body. More precisely it is the gradual rotation of the line joining the apsides of an orbit, which are the points of closest and farthest approach. Perihelion is the closest point to the Sun.
History.
The ancient Greek astronomers noted the apsidal precession of the Moon's orbit; the precession of the solar apsides was discovered in the eleventh century by al-Zarqālī. These remained difficult to account for until the 19th century.
Calculation.
There are a variety of factors which can lead to periastron precession, such as general relativity, stellar quadrupole moments, mutual star–planet tidal deformations, and perturbations from other planets.
˙ωtotal = ˙ωGR + ˙ωquad + ˙ωtide + ˙ωpert,
For Mercury, the perihelion precession rate due to general relativistic effects is 43" per century. By comparison, the precession due to perturbations from the other solar system planets is 532" per century while the oblateness of the Sun (quadrupole moment) causes a negligible contribution of 0".025 per century.
From classical mechanics, if stars and planets are considered to be purely spherical masses, then they will obey a simple r-2 force law and hence execute closed elliptical orbits. Non-spherical mass effects are caused by the application of external potential(s): the centrifugal potential of spinning bodies causes rotational flattening and the tidal potential of a nearby mass raises tidal bulges. Rotational and tidal bulges create gravitational quadrupole fields (r-3) that lead to orbital precession
Total apsidal precession broadly in order of importance for isolated very hot Jupiters is (considering only lowest order effects)
ωtot= ̇ωtid,p+ ̇ωGR+ ̇ωrot,p+ ̇ωrot,∗+ ̇ωtid,∗
with planetary tidal bulge being the dominant term, exceeding the effects of general relativity and the stellar quadrupole by more than an order of magnitude and thus can help us in understanding their interiors. For the shortest-period planets, the planetary interior induces precession of a few degrees per year and up to 19◦.9 per year for WASP-12b.
Newton's theorem of revolving orbits.
Newton derived an intriguing theorem showing that variations in the angular motion of a particle can be accounted for by the addition of a force that varies as the inverse cube of distance, without affecting the radial motion of a particle. Using a forerunner of the Taylor series, Newton generalized his theorem to all force laws provided that the deviations from circular orbits is small, which is valid for most planets in the Solar System. However, his theorem did not account for the apsidal precession of the Moon without giving up the inverse-square law of Newton's law of universal gravitation.
Perturbation theory.
The expected rate of apsidal precession can be calculated more accurately using the methods of perturbation theory.
General relativity.
An apsidal precession of the planet Mercury was noted by Urbain Le Verrier in the mid-19th century and accounted for by Einstein's theory of general relativity. To first approximation, this theory adds a central force that varies as the inverse fourth power of the distance.
Einstein showed that for a planet, the major semi-axis of its orbit being formula_1, the eccentricity of the orbit "e" and the period of revolution "T", then the apsidal precession due to relativistic effects, during one period of revolution in radians, is
where "c" is the speed of light. In the case of Mercury, half of the greater axis is circa 57,9 million kilometers or 57,9 · 109 m, the eccentricity of its orbit is 0,206 and the period of revolution 87,97 days, or 7,6 106 s. From these and the speed of light (which is 3 108 m/s), it can be calculated that the apsidial precession during one period of revolution is formula_3 = 5,028 · 10-7 radians, 2,88 · 10-5 degrees or 0,104 arc seconds. In one hundred years, Mercury makes circa 415 revolutions around the Sun, and thus in that time, the apsidal perihelion due to relativistic effects is circa 43 arc seconds, which corresponds almost exactly to the previously unexplained part of the measured value.
Long-term climate.
Because of apsidal precession the Earth's argument of periapsis slowly increases; it takes about over 134,000 years for the ellipse to revolve once relative to the fixed stars. The Earth's polar axis, and hence the solstices and equinoxes, precess with a period of about 25,771.4 years in relation to the fixed stars. These two forms of 'precession' combine so that it takes over 21,600 years for the ellipse to revolve once relative to the vernal equinox, that is, for the perihelion to return to the same date (given a calendar that tracks the seasons perfectly).
This interaction between the anomalistic and tropical cycle is important in the long-term climate variations on Earth, called the Milankovitch cycles. An equivalent is also known on Mars.
The figure illustrates the effects of precession on the northern hemisphere seasons, relative to perihelion and aphelion. Notice that the areas swept during a specific season changes through time. Orbital mechanics require that the length of the seasons be proportional to the swept areas of the seasonal quadrants, so when the orbital eccentricity is extreme, the seasons on the far side of the orbit may be substantially longer in duration.

Syarhey Vyeramko

Syarhey Mikalayevich Vyeramko (; ; born 16 October 1982 in Minsk) is a Belarusian footballer (goalkeeper), who is currently playing for FC Krylia Sovetov Samara and the Belarus national football team, both of which he captains.
Club career.
Vyeramko was born in the capital of Belarus and made his first steps in professional football with local outfit FC Dinamo-Juni Minsk in the early 2000s.
On 13 August 2008, Vyeramko was one of the key players for BATE Borisov in the Belarusians' away game against Bulgarian side Levski Sofia (third qualifying round of the Champions League), parrying a Georgi Ivanov shot from the penalty spot and making a number of other notable saves to deny the Levski Sofia forwards. The match ended 0:1 and a 1:1 home draw in Barysaw was sufficient to see the Belarusians progress to the group stages of the Champions League for the first time in their history. (Vyeramko did not play in the home leg due to a suspension attributable to accumulated yellow cards). However, Vyeramko was the starting goalkeeper in all of his team's games in the UEFA Champions League group stage, earning himself 1 yellow card during the Belarusians' 1:1 away draw against FC Zenit Saint Petersburg on 21 October 2008 (after a mild altercation with Portuguese forward Danny). On 9 April 2009, Vyeramko was shown a red card in the 17th minute of BATE Borisov's 0:1 away loss to FC Naftan Novopolotsk in a Belarusian Cup game for handling the ball outside his penalty area.
During the 2010 season, Vyeramko managed to keep a clean sheet in his first 6 games, but was subsequently injured. On 19 May 2010, he returned to first team action in the 1:0 home win against FC Dinamo Brest. Remarkably, he conceded his first goals for the season in the 1:2 home loss against FC Minsk on 13 June 2010. In the process, Vyeramko set a Belarusian Premier League record by keeping a clean sheet for 1016 consecutive minutes.
In September 2010, Vyeramko managed to save three successive penalties that he faced – on 16 September 2010, he denied Artem Milevskiy from the spot in the 2:2 away draw against Dynamo Kyiv in a UEFA Europa League game, on 22 September 2010, he parried a penalty that was taken by Stanislaw Drahun in the 1:3 home loss against Dinamo Minsk in a Belarusian Premier League match, and on 30 September 2010, he was up to the task against AZ Alkmaar's Jonathas in the 4:1 home win in a UEFA Europa League match.
In early January 2011, it was revealed that Vyeramko will sign a 2.5 year contract with Ukrainian Premier League side PFC Sevastopol, with the player claiming that he had reached the limit for his professional development in the Belarusian Premier League. The transfer was finalized on 14 January 2011. On 25 January 2011, Vyeramko made his unofficial debut for his new team, playing the first half of the 1:1 draw with Kazakh side FC Shakhter Karagandy. His official debut came on 3 March 2011, in the 0:1 home loss against table leaders FC Shakhtar Donetsk, with Veremko playing the full 90 minutes. Veremko quickly established himself as a starter for the side, but the team was relegated to the Ukrainian First League at the end of the season. In late July 2011, he signed a three-year contract with Russian club FC Krylya Sovetov, being envisioned as a replacement for Raïs M'Bolhi. On 1 August 2011, Vyeramko made his debut as a starter in the 1:1 home draw with Amkar Perm. In December 2011, he was selected as Krylya Sovetov's 2011 player of the year, with fellow Belarusian Sergei Kornilenko coming in second place. Veremko was also given the captain's armband on a full-time basis by manager Andrey Kobelev.
International career.
Since 2008 Vyeramko has been a regular member of the Belarus national football team. On 2 February 2008, Vyeramko made his debut for the national side in the 2:0 win against Iceland, which was the opening match of the unofficial Malta International Football Tournament 2008. His first stint between the sticks in a competitive game was in the 3:1 away win against Andorra on 10 September 2008 in a 2010 World Cup qualifier, with Vyeramko only conceding after a penalty kick. On 3 March 2010, Vyeramko earned his third cap in the 3:1 win against Armenia in a friendly match. On 26 March 2011, Vyeramko started in net in the Euro 2012 away qualifier against Albania due to an injury to first choice goalkeeper Yuri Zhevnov and made a number of good saves, though the only goal of the game was scored after a misunderstanding between him and defender Alyaksandr Martynovich. During Bernd Stange's tenure as head coach Veremko was mostly the second choice goalkeeper, but he became a starter after Georgi Kondratiev was appointed as manager. On 15 August 2012, he captained his country for the first time in the 2:1 win over Armenia in a friendly match. Veremko retained the captain's armband for the first two 2014 World Cup qualifiers – against Georgia and France.

<doc id="19349544" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19349544" title="Daphne and Celeste">
Daphne and Celeste

Daphne and Celeste were an American pop duo composed of Celeste Cruz and Karen DiConcetto. They are best known for their songs "Ooh Stick You" and "U.G.L.Y.".
Success and album reaction.
They released three singles in the UK: "Ooh Stick You!", "U.G.L.Y." and a cover version of Alice Cooper's "School's Out". A full-length album, "We Didn't Say That!", was released in Autumn 2000 to generally positive reviews ("Melody Maker" awarded it four out of five stars). Another single, "Party", was due in November 2000, but was never released.
The music of Daphne and Celeste could be described as pure pop marketed at a teen or pre-teen audience. The kitsch Asian-themed "I Love Your Sushi" features a Japanese rapper extolling the virtues of Daphne and Celeste in his native tongue. On "Peek-a-Boo", the girls find themselves at a monsters' ball attended by the bride of Frankenstein, Dracula, and Tom Cruise. Notwithstanding the presence of such novelty tracks, "Roll Call" is a conventional pop song, "Star Club" is a disco track, and "Hey Boy" is a slow ballad.
Despite the album's positive reviews, there were a lot of negative feelings towards Daphne and Celeste, with some dismissing them as a 'teeny-bopper' act (although others felt that such a judgement ignored the apparent irony with which they performed). This discontent culminated in the duo being bottled off the stage at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2000 in one of the festival's most iconic moments (the bottles in some cases would have contained urine). Reading and Leeds are primarily rock festivals, and Daphne and Celeste's negative reception there stemmed from their being an unabashed pop act. It was stated by the band before their appearance at Reading and Leeds Festivals that they had hounded their manager to get them on the bill so that they could meet Eminem. Eminem pulled out of his appearance and when Daphne and Celeste tried to do the same, the organisers refused to let them. This was later confirmed to be a rumor.
Many pop fans were also vociferous in their dislike for Daphne and Celeste. "U.G.L.Y." in particular was criticised, many feeling that it promoted bullying. Daphne and Celeste countered this by saying their lyrics were meant to be tongue in cheek. In an interview included on the "U.G.L.Y." single, Daphne noted: "Everyone is indeed ugly in their own special way." Daphne and Celeste made an appearance at Feet First. Daphne and Celeste even managed to score a TV and movie deal.
Soon the duo found themselves the subject of rumors regarding their true identities. Some claimed they were teenagers, while others claimed they were much older than reported and that they were discovered while working as receptionists at their record label.
Following relatively low album sales, and the backlash against them, Daphne and Celeste soon dropped out of the public eye. Their official website closed down in October 2001, and their management company, Perfect Noise Limited, was dissolved in November 2002. After the girls record label dropped them Celeste went back to school.
Later activities.
In a "Where Are They Now?" interview with "Q" magazine in 2005, Karen DiConcetto admitted that the whole project was "100% manufactured", and that the girls auditioned for it in New York in 1998: "I just talked about shoes for an hour." She considered the Reading Festival to be the highlight of the whole experience, and mentioned her work in theatre afterwards, specifically a play called "Tourrettaville", written by a boy with Tourette's syndrome. DiConcetto received positive reviews for her portrayal of "CB's Sister" in the FringeNYC award-winning "Peanuts" spoof "Dog Sees God". That production was adapted for an Off-Broadway debut featuring a number of big-name celebrities, including Eliza Dushku and America Ferrera.
In the same interview, Celeste Cruz said that she had also worked in theatre and that the duo were planning to break into television. In 2004, Celeste also took the role of "Maria" in the movie "Brooklyn Bound". Although not a main character, she is involved in a pivotal scene which fuels the tragedy of the denouement. She also features quite prominently on the DVD cover. In 2009 she appeared in an Emmy-nominated episode of "30 Rock" entitled "Generalissimo". Celeste can also be found on Twitter. Unlike DiConcetto, she considered the Reading Festival incident the "end of the party for us".
Daphne and Celeste were also interviewed by Bad Horsey towards the end of 2005, with the questions coming from the B3ta web community. The interview was posted on the Estudio Caballito Malo website and featured in the "Popbitch" newsletter. An edited version was published in the January 2006 edition of the UK publication "Fused Magazine".
DiConcetto has a role in Holger Ernst's "The House Is Burning", which premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival on 26 May. The film was produced by Wim Wenders, and is considered a German production, despite being filmed around New Jersey. In 2005 Daphne and Celeste had a mini reunion tour in the UK with Lolly.

Wide Open Spaces (1947 film)

Wide Open Spaces is a 1947 Donald Duck short cartoon, produced by Walt Disney and directed by Jack King for Walt Disney Productions and RKO Radio Pictures.
Synopsis.
A weary Donald pulls his car up to a motel in the wilderness. After finding that only the cot on the porch is available, and costs $16, he drives away to find a spot to set up his noisy air mattress.
As typical, Donald does not have an easy night sleep as he desperately tries to pump up the mattress and get some sleep. He then inadvertently causes a rockslide that crushes his car and rolls into a river sleeping with a fish in the bottom. 
Finally Donald gets some sleep but unknowingly a springy tree's branch strongly inflates the mattress with the pump and when it deflates propelling all the way back right into the motel's cot, Donald is charged the $16, but only spends a matter of seconds before being kicked off the cot and falling in the arms of a cactus, but still sleeping.

Kingdom of Araba

The Kingdom of Araba (or simply Araba) was a 2nd-century, semi-autonomous buffer kingdom between the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire, mostly under Parthian influence, located in modern Iraq. The city of Hatra was probably founded in the 3rd or 2nd century BCE, under the Seleucid kingdom. Arabs were common in Mesopotamia at the time of the Seleucids (3rd century BC). In the 1st and 2nd century, Hatra was ruled by a dynasty of Arabian princes. It rose to prominence as the capital of Araba. Hatra would become an important religious center as a result of its strategic position along caravan trade routes.
Araba is sometimes identified as the first Arab state to be established outside of Arabia. For others, that distinction is accorded to Al-Hirah (circa 300 CE), a vassal of the Sassanid Empire.

Big Brother Germany (season 4)

Season four of Big Brother Germany (Official title: Big Brother the Battle) lasted from 31 March 2003 to 7 July 2003 and was shown on RTL 2.
Season summary.
After a disappointing third season and a two-year absence, Big Brother returned in 2003 with lower expactations and Aleks Bechtel now as the only main host. Copying the "Battle"-format from the Netherlands, the season lasted for 98 Days, making it the shortest season on BB Germany. Eight housemates entered the house on Day 1 with 11 more contestants joining them throughout the season after these intruders lived together on a secret place called "the exile" on Majorca. There were two areas, one "poor" and one "rich" area. When one team won a match, they moved to the rich area and the other had to go to the poor area. The season was won by Jan Geilhufe. The title song of the season was performend by Olli P., who would eventually become the host in the next season, called "Alles ändert sich (Everything changes)".<br>
The fact that a certain amount of housemates lived together isolated before entering the real show proved to create some tension and relationships between the housemates. Sava Radovic for example was never too shy to flirt with the female contestants starting an on-and-off relationship with both Carla and Larissa in the Exile which became obvious when both entered the house together. After both of the girls got voted off very early blonde Hella made her entry into the main house to become Savas new object of desire and "serious" girlfriend on the show. Thanks to a reported bitchy behaviour in the exile, Lucie Daskiewitsch was the most hated housemate even before making her entrance into the house only to proof that she was not all that bad.<br>
Just like in former years, the winner Jan Geilhufe came from the former GDR and got along with everyone in the house. One could say he would fly under the radar but since similar types of housemates have won before, he was tipped to win from the very first day. He won a prize 90,000 Euros.<br>
Due to the excitement of return and divide of the household the season proved to be a surprise rating hit and resulted into the decision to progress the twists that were introduced in this season which were eventually seen in the next year.

<doc id="19349609" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19349609" title="Isolation tank">
Isolation tank

An isolation tank is a lightless, soundproof tank inside which subjects float in salt water at skin temperature. They were first used by John C. Lilly in 1954 to test the effects of sensory deprivation. Such tanks are now also used for meditation and relaxation and in alternative medicine. The isolation tank was originally called the sensory deprivation tank. Other names for the isolation tank include flotation tank, John C. Lilly tank, REST tank, sensory attenuation tank, and think tank. 
History.
The flotation tank was developed in 1954 by John C. Lilly, a medical practitioner and neuro-psychiatrist. During his training in psychoanalysis at the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Lilly commenced experiments with sensory deprivation. In neurophysiology, there had been an open question as to what keeps the brain going and the origin of its energy sources. One hypothesis was that the energy sources are biological and internal and do not depend upon the outside environment. It was argued that if all stimuli are cut off to the brain then the brain would go to sleep. Lilly decided to test this hypothesis and, with this in mind, created an environment which totally isolated an individual from external stimulation. From here, he studied the origin of consciousness and its relation to the brain.
Peter Suedfeld and Roderick Borrie of the University of British Columbia began experimenting on the therapeutic benefits of flotation tank usage in the late 1970s. They named their technique "Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy" (REST).
Tank design and usage.
The original float tanks involved being entirely submerged in the tank, and people were required to wear complicated head-masks to breathe, and uncomfortable tight clothing that constricted the blood flow in certain areas. Many users claimed that the mask and clothing detracted from the isolation experience by creating uncomfortable physical conditions, and that being entirely submerged in water led to the fear of drowning. The tight fit of the mask seal around the face and the retention strips wrapping around the back of the head were uncomfortable in long sessions. The constant hissing of the air valves and bubbling of exhaust air out of the mask prevented the possibility of silence. The faceplate of the mask was typically solid black for visual isolation, but then the tank user needed help entering and leaving the isolation tank since the mask blinded them. The tight neoprene clothing was extremely uncomfortable in sensitive areas such as the genitalia, and constricted blood flow and mobility in other areas. 
In current tanks, a solution of epsom salt is used for an increased density. The subject can now float with the face above the water, although the ears are still submerged when the subject is in a relaxed position. Hearing is therefore greatly reduced, particularly when using ear-plugs as protection against the salt water. When the arms float to the side, skin sensation is greatly reduced because the air and water are the same temperature as the skin, and the feeling of a body boundary fades. The sense of smell is also greatly reduced, especially if the water has not been treated with chlorine.
The growing number of commercial float tanks has brought increased regulation of disinfection. In the US different states have implemented different rules. In Europe, the DIN 19643 bathing water standard requires automated chlorination controlled by REDOX (ORP) measurement. Chlorine, bromine and peroxide disinfection have all been used successfully. There is doubt about ozone safety because of the closed air space. For this reason, H2O2 is cited by many industry professionals as a safer and more desirable sanitation agent.
Generally, users of isolation tanks enter the pool nude. The elastic material of a tight-fitting swimsuit can create uncomfortable compressed stress points on the skin during the session. Due to the high salt content, the water is rarely changed, and all users are expected to shower, wash with soap, and rinse clean prior to entering the tank to avoid getting oils from their skin into the tank. Bathing is again needed after a session to remove excess epsom salt from the skin, and white vinegar is often used to remove excess salt from the ear canal and hair.
Most isolation tanks use a surface skimmer, cartridge filtration, and disinfection means, including ultraviolet sterilization and chemicals to keep the water free of microbes and sediment. These machines are usually turned off during a session to keep the isolation space as quiet as possible. A ring heating system can be used around the outer walls of the tank so that warm water rises around the edges of the pool, travels towards the center, and then sinks under the tank user. This very slow water convection flow helps to keep the user centered in the middle of the pool. The small waves caused by breathing also aid in centering the subject.
Isolation tank construction and plumbing is typically all plastic. Typically glass reinforced resins are used. High quality flotation tanks may use acrylic or medical stainless steel which is impervious to the strong salt solution and more importantly the disinfectants. Epsom salt is not corrosive in the way sodium chloride is, but unsealed stone and concrete surfaces outside the tank can be damaged by splashed or dripped salt water as the recrystallizing salt opens up cracks and fissures as it dries. Chlorine used as a disinfectant can attack some surfaces such as marble.
It is useful to have a shower stall in the same room as the tank. Before a session, the tank user can transfer directly from the shower to the tank without drying off, which helps prevent oil from the user's skin from entering the water. Following the session, they can immediately rinse off which minimizes the dripping of corrosive salt through the building.
Having plumbing facilities immediately next to the tank is also helpful when the water must eventually be changed to prevent microbe growth. The plumbing, including the drain pipes, should be constructed of plastic to prevent deterioration from the salt. The salt concentration may need to be diluted when discarded, to prevent damage to small private wastewater plumbing systems.
Types of sessions.
A therapeutic session in a flotation tank typically lasts between an hour to an hour and a half. For the first forty minutes, it is reportedly possible to experience itching in various parts of the body (a phenomenon also reported to be common during the early stages of meditation). The last twenty minutes often end with a transition from beta or alpha brainwaves to theta, which typically occurs briefly before sleep and again at waking. In a float tank, the theta state can last indefinitely without the subject losing consciousness. Many use the extended theta state as a tool for enhanced creativity and problem solving or for super learning. The more often the tank is used the longer the theta period becomes.
Spas sometimes provide commercial float tanks for use in relaxation. Flotation therapy has been academically studied in the USA and in Sweden with published results showing reduction of both pain and stress. The relaxed state also involves lowered blood pressure and maximum blood flow.
Floating can be passive or active, depending on the purpose. For relaxation, one simply floats and 'clears the mind.' Active floating has many different techniques. One may perform meditation, mantras, self-hypnosis, utilize educational programs, etc. The idea of active floating is that, when the body is relaxed, the mind becomes highly suggestible and any action taken during these states will enter the information into the sub-conscious. Flotation therapy may be used to complement other body work and healing methods.
Flotation therapy.
Flotation therapy is therapy that is undertaken by floating in a warm salt water in a float tank.
Flotation therapy developed from the research work of John Lilly although he was not primarily interested in therapy, rather in the effect of sensory deprivation on the human brain and mind.
People using early float tanks discovered that they enjoyed the experience and that the relaxed state was also a healing state for many conditions including stress, anxiety, pain, swelling, insomnia and jet lag.
As a result float tanks were produced for commercial uses and commercial float centers offering flotation therapy opened in several countries during the period from 1980 to the present day when there are hundreds of flotation centers in dozens of countries. In almost all cases these float centers offer wellness treatments and in particular the release of stress. The San Francisco Bay Area has seen recent growth in such centers.
Research into flotation therapy (as opposed to just the effect of isolation) began in the USA at Ohio State University where floating was shown to improve creativity in Jazz musicians, accuracy in rifle shooting, focus before academic examinations and stress relief, among others.
Research in Sweden has demonstrated the therapeutic effect on stress and pain.
The technique takes advantage of an innate, natural inclination to relax when floating at a comfortable temperature. The temperature is that which allows natural heat generation to escape without the need for muscle action to raise body temperature in homeostasis. The floating posture, usually the supine position (although the prone position with chin supported on elbows is recommended for pregnant women), allows all the postural muscles to relax. The water pressure on the immersed skin is lower than the blood pressure and thus blood flow continues in skin capillaries. This is in contrast to normal bed rest where local contact pressure inhibits blood flow requiring regular adjustment of posture. When people cannot adjust their posture in bed, e.g. in some illnesses, bed sores can result. When floating there is no tendency to adjust posture and a person can float immobile for many hours.
The natural tendency of the body in the floating posture at the correct temperature is to dilate the blood vessels, reducing the blood pressure and maximizing blood flow. The brain activity normally associated with postural muscles is reduced to a minimum. In this state, which we can call the floating state, natural endorphins are released reducing pain. Lactic acid removal is accelerated. Flow in the lymphatic system is increased.
Effects.
The effect on stress.
Perceived stress can be correlated with increased levels of cortisol and in flotation therapy there is a natural tendency for cortisol to be reduced. For this reason, flotation therapy is one of the few noninvasive techniques available to manage stress when it is a factor in reducing a person's ability to cope with normal life. Flotation therapy is a fast technique in this respect. The Swedish research was based on 40 minute float sessions. This compares well with other management techniques such as long vacations.
There are some similarities with the age old long hot bath. However, the main differences are that in floatation all sensory impressions are absent, temperature is maintained at the correct level and the bath is large enough to float without touching the sides of the float unit. These factors allow the individual to achieve much deeper level of relaxation, and therapeutic benefit, than would otherwise be possible.
The effect of the salt.
Most float tanks use Epsom salt, magnesium sulfate, in high concentration so that the relative density of the solution is about 1.25. (Lilly recommended 1.3 but this requires operating very close to saturation with the risk of recrystallization). The density assists floating particularly making the head buoyant so that the nose and mouth are well out of the water for breathing.
It has recently been discovered that there is a secondary effect which is important to flotation therapy. Magnesium is absorbed through the skin due to natural molecular diffusion. This tends to correct magnesium deficiency. Magnesium is absorbed from the diet but in many areas of the world, over-cropping without adequate replacement of magnesium makes the normal diet low in magnesium.
The body naturally optimizes the levels of magnesium, so there is no overload effect from floating in the salts for extended periods.
It is noted that there is no "flotation therapist", although there is a need to instruct the floater and need to maintain the equipment in a safe condition. However, flotation therapy is compatible with other therapies as a preparation or conjunct activity. Examples include massage, talk therapy, and hypnosis.
Definition.
Latest research.
New research undertaken at the Human Performance Laboratory at Karlstad University Sven-Åke Bood concludes that regular flotation tank sessions can provide significant relief for chronic stress-related ailments. Studies involving 140 people with long-term conditions such as anxiety, stress, depression and fibromyalgia found that more than three quarters experienced noticeable improvements.
Dr. Bood commented: "Through relaxing in floating tanks, people with long-term fibromyalgia, for instance, or depression and anxiety felt substantially better after only 12 treatments". Research targeted the effectiveness of floatation treatment with regard to stress related pain and anxiety over the period of seven weeks. 23 percent of the participants became entirely free of pain and 56 percent experienced clear improvement.
Broken down to various symptoms, the results were as follows: 23 percent slept better, 31 percent experienced reduced stress, 27 percent felt less agony and 24 percent became less depressed or got rid of their depression altogether. The research also confirms the findings of an earlier thesis that flotation, after only twelve sessions, substantially improves sleep patterns leaving users more optimistic and with reduced nervousness, tension and pain. Relaxing in a weightless state in the silent warmth of a flotation tank activates the body's own system for recuperation and healing, said Sven-Åke Bood. What researchers find particularly gratifying is that the positive effects were still in evidence 4 months after the floating treatment ended.
Notable users.
The physicist Richard Feynman's experiences in a sensory deprivation tank were documented in the popular book "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!". Feynman was invited to try the isolation tank at John Lilly's home after Lilly attended one of Feynman's popular lectures on quantum mechanics. 
In a number of recent videos on YouTube and his own podcast, American stand-up comedian and television celebrity Joe Rogan describes his personal experiences with isolation tanks and shares his insights into using them for various purposes, such as exploring the nature of consciousness and improving health and well being.

The Dresden Dolls

The Dresden Dolls are an American musical duo from Boston, Massachusetts. Formed in 2000, the group consists of Amanda Palmer (lead vocals, piano, harmonica, ukulele) and Brian Viglione (drums, percussion, guitar, bass guitar, vocals). The two describe their style as "Brechtian punk cabaret", a phrase invented by Palmer because she was "terrified" that the press would invent a name that "would involve the word "gothic"". The Dresden Dolls are part of an underground dark cabaret movement that started gaining momentum in the early 2000s.
Career.
Band formation and name.
The duo formed a week after Brian Viglione witnessed Amanda Palmer perform solo at a Halloween party in 2000. Their live performances soon gained them a cult following. During these performances the two band members often wore dramatic make-up and fancy clothing that pushed their cabaret/theater aesthetic. They encourage fans to become involved at their shows, with the fans' own stilt walking, living statues, fire breathers, and other performance art becoming an integral part of the show. The Dirty Business Brigade coordinated the fans' performances.
The band's first name was Out of Arms. At some point, the name became The Dresden Dolls. The name, according to Palmer, was "inspired by a combination of things," including the firebombing of Dresden, Germany and the porcelain dolls that were a hallmark of pre-war Dresden industry; an early song of the same name by The Fall; and a reference to the V. C. Andrews novel "Flowers in the Attic", where the classically blond-haired and blue-eyed protagonists are called "the Dresden dolls". The name also evokes Weimar Germany and its cabaret culture. Additionally, Palmer "liked the parallel between Dresden (destruction) and Dolls (innocence, delicacy), because it is very much in keeping with the dynamics of the music, which sometimes goes from a childlike whisper to a banshee scream within a few seconds."
Growing fame and performances.
The duo was featured in a webcast performance at the 2002 Ig Nobel Prize ceremony in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After a self-promoted demo recorded and released in 2001, their first release was the mostly live compilation "A Is for Accident" (Important Records), followed in 2003 by a self-titled debut produced and recorded by Martin Bisi (Swans, Sonic Youth) at The Old American Can Factory in Gowanus, Brooklyn. The album features fellow Boston-area musicians Ad Frank (guitar on "Good Day") and Shawn Setaro (bass on "Good Day," "Gravity", and "Jeep Song"). Two songs off the album ranked in the Triple J Hottest 100, 2004: "Girl Anachronism" at number 30 and "Coin-Operated Boy" at number 12. In 2003 they were crowned the winners of Boston's long-running WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble.
On October 6, 2005, The Dresden Dolls were interviewed by the subject of one of their songs, Christopher Lydon, on the radio show "Open Source".
Tours, festivals, books, and theater.
In March 2005, the duo supported Nine Inch Nails on tour. On June 5, The Dresden Dolls hosted a free concert at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston. When a power outage unexpectedly delayed their performance, city streets became a temporary stage for some of the many performers (living statues, stilt-walkers, and fire-breathers) who had come from across the world to entertain audiences. The entire event—concert and street performances—was filmed and the resulting DVD, "", was released in Europe on October 10, 2005 and in North America on November 22, shortly after the band's fall 2005 tour.
The Dresden Dolls' second studio album, "Yes, Virginia...", was released on April 18, 2006.
Over the summer of that year, the duo performed at South by Southwest, Bonnaroo, Britain's Reading and Leeds Festivals, and Lollapalooza, in addition to touring with Panic! at the Disco as their opening act. During the support tour, the band presented "Fuck the Back Row—A Night of Celluloid Vaudeville". The events consisted of screenings of short films from friends and fans, performances by local artists, and a solo show by Palmer who performed mostly cover songs inspired from film soundtracks.
In June 2006, "The Dresden Dolls Companion" was released by Amanda Palmer. The book contains a history of the band and their first album—"The Dresden Dolls"—as well as a partial autobiography. The book also contains the lyrics, sheet music, and notes on each song on the album, as well as a DVD featuring a 20-minute interview with Palmer about the origins of the band and the first LP. The interview was conducted by a friend while Palmer compiled the artwork for the first LP.
On August 16, the East Providence Community Theatre in East Providence, Rhode Island premiered a full-length, fan-written jukebox musical, "The Clockwork Waltz", featuring songs from The Dresden Dolls' three albums. The show was encouraged by the band and their management.
In December 2006 and January 2007, the music of The Dresden Dolls was featured in an original production—"The Onion Cellar"—at the American Repertory Theatre's Zero Arrow Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The play is co-authored by Amanda Palmer, from her original concept.
On January 14, 2007, the duo took a temporary hiatus. Palmer worked on her solo album, "Who Killed Amanda Palmer", while Brian Viglione toured with Boston-based HUMANWINE and other local Boston acts, along with touring with Jesse Malin and offering drum clinics.
In June 2007, they joined the True Colors Tour 2007, including their debut in New York City's Radio City Music Hall and their first review in the "New York Times".
On July 10, 2007, the DVD, "Live at the Roundhouse", was released in the U.S.
From December 27, 2007 to January 13, 2008, their Winter Tour started at the Sixth & I Historic Synagogue in Washington, DC, and ending at The Norva in Norfolk, Virginia.
On January 15, 2008, they entered the studio to record new material for their fourth album, "No, Virginia..." Released on May 20, 2008, it is a collection of B-sides and rarities, along with new recordings of old favorites and cover songs that were previously only available as live versions. The album spawned the single, "Night Reconnaissance".
July 2008 saw the release of the second Dresden Dolls book, the "Virginia Companion". It is a follow-up to the "Dresden Dolls Companion", featuring the music and lyrics from the "Yes, Virginia..." and "No, Virginia..." albums.
Hiatus.
In September 2008, rumors began to circulate about the future of the whole band. Viglione confirmed that the band is currently on hiatus but emphasized that he and Palmer are on good terms and that they will get together again when it feels right for both of them. In late July and early August 2009, a rumor began to spread that the band was "reuniting for performances in 2010" but Palmer clarified in her blog on August 7: "There's been a ton of press lately re-printing an old quote from an old interview that's now blown up into a full-fledged press rumour that Brian and I have planned Dresden Dolls' shows for 2010. Not true. We aren't planning any shows. Sorry about that, blame the gossip whores."
2010 reunion tour.
In 2010, a reunion tour to selected venues in the United States occurred. It started on Halloween in New York City and ended in San Francisco on New Year's Eve.
2011/2012 tour.
The Dresden Dolls played a show in Mexico City on December 9, 2011. They had a tour of New Zealand and Australia in January 2012, supported by The Jane Austen Argument in Australia, and Hera, House of Mountain and Princess Chelsea in New Zealand.
Musical style.
The Dresden Dolls are arguably the most commercially successful dark cabaret band, bringing more mainstream attention to the still fairly underground genre. Their piano and drum driven rock music, incorporated into alternative rock song structures with piano replacing the rhythm guitar, has seen them fall into the piano rock genre.

Genesee College

Genesee College was founded as the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary, in 1831, by the Methodist Episcopal Church. The college was located in Lima, New York, and eventually relocated to Syracuse, becoming Syracuse University.
Genesee Wesleyan Seminary.
In 1831, the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary was founded in Lima, south of Rochester, by the Genesee Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The Rev. Dr. Samuel Luckey was elected the first Principal of the seminary, and was transferred from the New York Annual Conference to the Genesee Conference of the M.E. Church . He remained in office until 1836, when he was elected as editor of "The Christian Advocate and Journal", an important periodical for the M.E. General Conference.
The institution is said to have "opened most favorably," with a total enrollment of 341 the first year (1831–32), with 170-180 students attending at any one time. The Agents of the seminary solicited funds for the construction of buildings. In 1880, Bishop Matthew Simpson of the M.E. Church described the seminary's early years thus "no other institution in the church accomplishing apparently more in the education of active and useful young men and young women." The early years of the institution were said to be ones of "great prosperity." This was especially true under the administrations of the Rev. Schuyler Seager. Seager was born 8 July 1807 in Simsbury, Connecticut. He joined the Genesee Conference in 1833. He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1836. That same year he was appointed Teacher of Moral Science and Belles-Lettres in the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary. He was chosen as Principal of the seminary in 1837. After entering pastoral ministry in 1844, he returned to the seminary in 1854, again as Principal.In 1856-57 he was made Principal of the Genesee Model School in Lima, New York, an offshoot of the seminary. Joseph Cummings was appointed President of Genesee in 1854, a position he held until 1857.
Genesee College.
In 1850 it was resolved to enlarge the institution from a seminary into a college, or to connect a college with the seminary. The Rev. Dr. Benjamin Franklin Tefft was elected President of this endeavor. The name was chosen as Genesee College. However, the location was thought by many not to be sufficiently central. Its difficulties were compounded by the next set of technological changes: the railroad that displaced the Erie Canal as the region's economic engine bypassed Lima completely. In 1866, after several hard years, the trustees of the struggling college decided to seek a locale whose economic and transportation advantages could provide a better base of support. As Genesee College began looking for a new home, the bustling community of Syracuse, ninety miles to the east, was engaged in a search of its own. The rail age had expanded the prosperity brought by the Erie Canal, and the city was booming, but its citizens yearned for something more:
"What gives to Oxford and Cambridge, England, to Edinburgh, Scotland, to New Haven, Connecticut, their most illustrious names abroad?" asked one local writer. "Their Universities," he answered. "Syracuse has all the advantages: business, social, and religious – let her add the educational and she adds to her reputation, her desirability."
After a year of dispute between the Methodist ministers, Lima and contending cities across the state, it was resolved to remove the college to Syracuse, New York. In 1869, Genesee College obtained New York State approval to move to Syracuse, but Lima got a court injunction to block the move, and Genesee stayed in Lima until it was dissolved in 1875. At its founding on March 24, 1870, the state of New York granted the University its charter independent of Genesee College. The university opened in September 1871. The college, its libraries, the students and faculty, and the college's two secret societies all relocated to Syracuse. Two seminary / college buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

John Wallace Downie

Hon. John Wallace Downie CMG (1876 - 1940) served as High Commissioner of Southern Rhodesia from 1930 to 1935. The son of Lanark Station Master Christopher Downie, he was born in Lanark, Scotland, emigrating to South Africa in 1897 to work on the Cape Railways. Here he worked on the line in process of construction from Bechuanaland to Bulawayo. Subsequently he worked for a time as postmaster in Francistown. On 15 October 1899, following the declaration of The Anglo-Boer War, John Downie volunteered to join the Francistown Defence Force 1899 under the leadership of Umfreville Percy Swinburne. 
In 1900 he returned to Glasgow in order to study, coming back to Africa in 1901.
On his return he was appointed secretary of a small mining company and subsequently joined the firm of Haddon, Cotton & Butt, a Rhodesian shipping and forwarding house. John Downie was very successful in his new position and rose to be managing director. He was interested in a number of gold mining ventures, and in addition to his firm acted as manager of the Portland Cement Works for some time. John Downie later sold his interests in the firm, and in 1920 he became manager of the Salisbury Farmer's Co-operative, holding this post till the period of the end of Chartered Company Rule in 1923.
John Downie was a keen advocate of responsible government and served as treasurer of the Responsible Government Party. Subsequently he became Chairman of the Rhodesia Party and was responsible for much of the work of party organisation.
On 29 April 1924, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly as co-member, with Francis James Newton, for Mazoe under the system of double member constituencies then in existence.
On 30 January, 1925, he became Minister of Agriculture and Lands and in this capacity he played an important part in popularising Rhodesian tobacco in London, in encouraging the cotton industry and in promoting agricultural co-operative efforts.
On 14 October, 1927, he took over the portfolio for Mines and Public Works, but continued to take a considerable interest in agricultural affairs.
John Downie was strongly critical of the management of the railways and several times clashed with the railway companies on that score. On the other hand, he was able to reach a satisfactory arrangement with the Chartered Company to solve the problems of simplifying the collection of mining revenue, and he took an important part in settling some of the differences between miners and farmers.
He remained in the Ministry till G.Mitchell succeeded him on 1 November, 1930. John Downie then took over Newton's post as High Commissioner for Southern Rhodesia in London, and continued to hold this position until 1935, when he retired to become Chairman of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Airways. He was a member of the Southern Rhodesian delegation to the Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa in 1932. In 1939 he returned to the work of administrator as Controller of Suppliers. He left considerable estate and in his will endowed the John Downie Bursaries for Prince Edward School and the Girl's High School, Salisbury.
In 1929 John Downie received the award of companion (CMG) to The Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George.

Cwrt Sart Comprehensive School

Cwrt Sart Community Comprehensive is a school located in Briton Ferry, Neath, Wales. It is one of the many schools in Neath Port Talbot.
Carreg Hir.
The Carreg Hir ('long stone') is 9 ft 2 in (2.8 m) high, 5 ft 7 in (1.7 m) wide and about 2 ft (0.6 m) thick. The stone was re-erected into a concrete plinth in modern times, though it is believed to be in its original location. Archaeologists think that it may once have stood upon a mound, overlooking the River Neath.
There is a published 1848 reference to this stone in which it says that "there is a charm, not yet discovered, which can compel stone to speak, and for once to reveal the secret of its history: but that having once spoken it will be silent forever." Another legend says that there is an underground passage leading between the stone and Neath Abbey some 1.3 miles (2.1 km) to the North; the stone is said to be aligned upon it.
Renaming the School.
In 2008, the name of Cwrt Sart Comprehensive School was officially changed to Cwrt Sart "Community" Comprehensive School. This was carried out under the headmaster Huw Lloyd, in an attempt to incorporate the Briton Ferry community in the school. Earlier, in late 2007 / earlier 2008, the school motto was changed from "Man's wealth is his ability" to "Cyflwyni trwy gredu" or "Achieving through believing." This was a modernisation, as the old motto was viewed as sexist, and focused on older idealisms.

John Copnall

John Bainbridge Copnall (1928–2007) was an English artist best known for his abstract expressionist painting of richly coloured stylised realism, often on a grand scale. He was also a teacher of painting for twenty years at the Central School of Art and Design in London.
Early life.
John Copnall was born in Slinfold, a village near Horsham in West Sussex. His father was the eminent sculptor Edward Bainbridge Copnall (1903–1970) whilst his mother Muriel, his uncle and aunt Frank and Theresa Copnall were both enthusiastic amateur artists. Another uncle, Hubert Copnall (1918–1997), was also an artist and sculptor, although he spent over thirty years farming, having been initially so required as a World War II conscientious objector. His paternal grandfather EW Copnall was an early photographer and artist.
Copnall showed early promise in drawing and his strong draughtsman skills would be at the heart of his work throughout his painting life. At the age of eighteen he began studies at the Architectural Association in London. This proved a poor choice of a career as Copnall lacked the required mathematical ability and used the excuse of his National Service to leave the profession permanently in order to become a professional artist 
His Career in Spain.
Initially Copnall started his painting studies under the tutelage of his father at the Sir John Cass School of Art in the City of London and from 1949 under the artist Sir Henry Rushbury at the Royal Academy School. His early work is largely figurative and he won the prestigious Turner Gold Medal for Landscape Painting in his final year in 1954. 
In 1954 he and his friend Bert Flugelman visited Spain for what was intended to be a short visit. The effect was almost instant and he fell in love with the Iberian landscape staying for fourteen years. Whilst on Ibiza he married his first wife Madeleine Chardon with whom he had a daughter and when the marriage ended he moved to the mainland to live in a hacienda in the mountains above Malaga where he earned a living as a painter sometimes using the name of Juan de Retamá. The intense light of Spain and the visceral nature of its people changed his art fundamentally as he experimented with intense earthy colours whilst increasingly moving towards abstraction. Throughout his career Copnall was interested in using intense colour and the Spanish light undoubtedly enhanced his artistic senses.
As the 60’s progressed Copnall became fashionable and he began to sell his paintings to private collectors that included Melvyn Douglas. He had several solo exhibitions in Spain and Catalonia as well as shows in Germany where he was also popular and a lesser one in England in Newcastle. He said of his life in the 1960s: "No Beatles, but plenty of bullfighting, flamenco and Rioja!" 
Return To England.
In 1968 John Copnall returned to England and the following year held a solo exhibition at the Bear Lane Gallery in Oxford. His work was clearly influenced by that of American abstract expressionists such as Barnett Newman, Morris Louis and Mark Rothko with Copnall using acrylic paint on cotton duck on increasingly larger canvasses. His use of colour was exuberant. 'Painting is colour and colour is painting." said Copnall. In 1970 he won the E A Abbey Scholarship and further recognition followed with Art Council awards in 1973 and a British Council Award in 1979. As the 60s progressed abstract art began to lose influence as new ‘pop’ style were in vogue and to some extent Copnall found himself less fashionable during the late 70s and 80s.
A series of solo exhibitions were held throughout the 1970s but Copnall was becoming a peripheral figure in the context of mainstream English art. Nevertheless his influence on the next generation of British artists is evident following a twenty year period from 1973 to 1993 when Copnall worked as a teacher at the Central School of Art and Design. He had married for the second time in 1976 to Caroline Brown with whom he had a son and a daughter and he required the financial stability that teaching provided.The marriage was dissolved in 1997.
Later years in London.
He was by 1982 working in an artists' colony in the East End of London having bought the defunct Spratts Dog Food warehouse in Bow whilst continuing his teaching role.
In 1996 his solo show "Reflections, Orbits and Radiances" in the sympathetic surroundings of the De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill-on-Sea, Sussex drew mainly on work done in the period 1992-96. In the catalogue, Christopher Lloyd, Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, considered that it was "difficult to think of a more appropriate setting for John Copnall's paintings" than this light-filled example of pioneering mid-1930s architecture.
In 1988 John Copnall was elected to the important London Group, an artists' exhibiting society based in London dating from 1913 and founded to help independent minded artists challenge the pre eminence of the Royal Society by promoting radical thought in English art. It was a natural place for the independent minded Copnall. 
During the final years of his life Copnall painted infrequently and ceased all together following a stroke. He died on June 9, 2007 following a short illness.
A memorial exhibition was held by Mark Barrow Fine Art (who represent the artists' estate) in London in October 2007. Works by John Copnall are available exclusively from www.markbarrowfineart.co.uk

Practical engineer

A practical engineer () is a professional degree awarded by technological colleges in Israel and validated by the National Institute for Technological Training of the Ministry of Industry, Trade & Labor (State of Israel).
It is a unique qualification that combines theoretical study with practical training, and is currently available only in Israel.
Practical Engineers are legally registered and are certified to perform engineering duties up to a certain level. 
It normally takes up to 3 academic years to obtain a Practical Engineer's degree, depending on the taught discipline. 
Professional regulation.
Practical Engineers are used to mediate between engineers and technicians. 
While most of the decision making process is performed by engineers and most of the practical work is done by technicians, practical engineers are taught to be able to follow instructions and re-adapt concepts designed by engineers.
In Israel, practical engineers are an integral part of the hi-tech industry and form an important work-force.
Practical Engineers are licensed to lead and hold responsible for engineering projects up to a certain level.
For example, in Israel, architectural practical engineers are permitted to design constructions of up to four stories high, while for larger scale projects a full engineering degree is required.
Education, training & skills.
Practical engineers receive formal education that meets with criteria published by the National Institute for Technological Training.
In sum over 2100 frontal academic hours are taught over a period of two to three years.
From an academic point of view, the main things differentiating engineers from practical engineers are the level and magnitude of foundation subjects, such as mathematics and physics.
Practical Engineers are taught foundations but only to the extent required by their profession, hence making their study shorter and more focused.
As part of the certification process, practical engineers are also required to undertake national certification tests, and to complete and defend a final project in their field of study or to participate in an internship program.
Equivalent qualifications.
There are some international qualifications equivalent to the Practical Engineer's degree. In Spain, the title of Ingeniero Técnico (Spanish for Technical Engineer) bears many similarities to its Israeli equivalent. Also, although not exactly the same, Practical Engineers are often thought of as Engineering Technicians, Associate Engineers or Jr. Engineers in some English speaking countries.
Although not an academic degree in its traditional sense, practical engineers are normally awarded some academic credit when pursuing further study at a Bachelor's degree

Thomas Berridge

Thomas Henry Devereux Berridge (6 July 1857 – 24 October 1924) was a British Liberal politician and solicitor.
Family and education.
Berridge was the son of the Reverend W Berridge the Vicar of Lowton St. Mary’s in Lancashire. He was educated privately and at Upholland Grammar School where his father was the headmaster. In 1887 Berridge married Agnes Campion from Redhill. Mrs Berridge suffered from heart problems in later life and while apparently in good health and spirits was taken ill suddenly at a dance in Kensington and died in a few minutes in Feb. 1909. They had one son and one daughter.
Solicitor.
Berridge went into the law and was articled to Maskell Peace, solicitors of Wigan, who were the solicitors to the Mining Association of Great Britain. In 1878 he was admitted as a solicitor. In 1882 he became a partner in the firm of Burn & Berridge, solicitors to the government of Newfoundland. He was a member and later Master of the Court of the City of London Solicitors' Company of which David Lloyd George was also a member.
Political and public life.
Like most middle-class men of his time, Berridge took an interest in public affairs. He was some time Chairman of the Law and Parliamentary Committee of the Board of Works for the St Giles District in London and he wanted a full-time career in politics. In 1904, he was Honorary Secretary of a committee of leading Liberal organisations set up to honour the retirement of Sir William Harcourt and commissioned two portraits of Sir William painted one for the family and the other to hang in the National Liberal Club.
Warwick & Leamington by-election, 1903.
In the summer of 1902 there were rumours of a possible vacancy in the constituency of Warwick and Leamington when the sitting Liberal Unionist member Alfred Lyttelton was tipped for an appointment to be a Judge or Governor of a British Colony. In the event this did not happen but it provided the opportunity for Berridge to associate himself with the constituency. In 1903 however Lyttelton was appointed Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Parliamentary regulations of the day required him to contest a by-election. Berridge was adopted as Liberal candidate. There was some initial suggestion that Lyttelton should not be opposed but the local Liberal Association decided there were good precedents for such a contest and wished to have the chance of opposing the government on its policies. Besides, Alfred Lyttelton was to succeed Joseph Chamberlain as Colonial Secretary and the Warwick & Leamington seat being so close to Chamberlain's Birmingham stronghold it was considered by the Liberals as something of a ‘rotten borough’ which Chamberlain felt he could dispose of as he wished, and this was added reason for the Liberals' wish to stand a candidate. The by-election resulted in a Unionist majority of 190 for Lyttelton over Berridge on a turnout of 86%. This contrasted to Lyttelton’s majority of 831 at the previous general election in 1900.
General Election of 1906.
Berridge remained the local Liberal candidate after the by-election and when the new Liberal prime minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman announced the dissolution of Parliament on 16 December 1905 and called a general election for January 1906, Warwick and Leamington Liberal Association was quick to adopt Berridge formally as Liberal and free-trade candidate at a meeting on 18 December.
On 12 January 1906, Lloyd George came to a public meeting in Leamington to speak for Berridge but due to a large number of Unionist supporters (many imported from Birmingham) causing disruption and noise and singing patriotic songs in the hall, he was never able to make himself heard and had to leave and make his speech to a smaller gathering of Liberals at another location. 
Benefitting from the surge in support for the Liberal Party at the general election, Berridge won Warwick and Leamington with a majority of 209 votes, removing Lyttelton from the House of Commons, at least for a few weeks until he was returned unopposed at a by-election for the seat of St George's, Hanover Square in Westminster. Berridge remained MP for Warwick and Leamington for four years until the general election of January 1910 when he was defeated by the Conservative Ernest Pollock. In March 1910 Berridge gave his constituency party notice that he was unlikely to contest the next election after his defeat but he did in fact agree to stand at the December 1910 general election although he again lost to Pollock.
Honours.
Berridge was knighted in 1912 and made a KBE in 1920 for his war work, in particular for his chairmanship of the executive committee of the Royal Flying Corps later the Royal Air Force Voluntary Hospitals between 1916-1919.
Death.
Berridge died in a nursing home at Sandgate, Kent at the age of 67 on 24 October 1924.

St Andrew's Church, Waterloo Street, Hove

St Andrew's Church is a former Anglican church in the Brunswick Town area of Hove, part of the English city of Brighton and Hove. Although declared redundant in 1990, it was one of the area's most fashionable places of worship in the 19th century, when it was built to serve the wealthy residents of the Brunswick estate and surrounding areas. It is listed at Grade I, a designation used for buildings "of outstanding architectural or historic interest".
History.
The area between Brighton, to the east, and the ancient centre of Hove, to the west, was farmland until the 1820s, when Brunswick Town was developed in response to the success of the Kemp Town estate in Brighton—a planned estate of high-class houses, servants' quarters and other buildings, all in the Regency style. Architect Charles Busby planned and built the Brunswick Town estate, which (together with other nearby residential development) helped the population of Hove to rise from 100 in 1801 to 2,500 in 1841.
The only church nearby was St Andrew's, the ancient parish church; this was some distance away and had fallen into near-dereliction. The curate of the (now demolished) St Margaret's Church in Cannon Place, Brighton, Rev. Edward Everard, owned some land near the former Wick Farm, on which the Brunswick Town estate had been built. He was aware that there was no plan to build a church in the estate, so he decided to build a proprietary chapel on his land. Rev. Everard knew Charles Busby, but they had fallen out after a disagreement in 1824 over the commission for the Sussex County Hospital (now the Royal Sussex County Hospital) in Brighton: Everard was overruled by other members of the planning committee and had to break his promise that Busby would be allowed to design it. Therefore, Everard looked for a different architect to design and build the church, and Charles Barry—who had already built the hospital and St Peter's Church in Brighton—was chosen.
Construction started in April 1827. Everard was granted an Act of Parliament on 3 April 1828 giving him and his successors ownership of the church, the right to appoint a curate for the next 40 years, and two-thirds of income from pew rents and other sources. Everard himself acted as the first curate, from the church's consecration on 5 July 1828 until 1838, one year before his death.
St Andrew's immediately became popular with the fashionable set, helped by the regular presence of members of the Royal Family and the aristocracy. Among the many Dukes and Duchesses to worship there in the mid-19th century was the elderly Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, who often made loud and sometimes eccentric comments and remarks during services. Between 300 and 350 people regularly worshipped at the church in 1851 according to a census taken during that year; there were 420 pews, 340 of which were subject to pew rents.
The interior was reordered in 1869, with new open benches installed in place of individual seats. A more radical change took place in 1882, when the church was extended at a cost of £7,000 (£2,000 to buy and demolish an adjacent stable block and £5,000 for the construction work); Charles Barry's son Edward Middleton Barry added a chancel, a sanctuary with Ionic columns, an illuminated dome and space for an organ. Although the organ is no longer in place, its case has been retained. A pulpit had been donated in 1918, and more additions were made in the 1920s, including enlargements to the altar case, a pedimented baldacchino above the altar, a marble font with its own baldacchino, new stained glass windows and new, clearer Venetian glass surrounding these. The changes cost £4,000. The stated intention was to brighten the interior of the church and "create a little piece of Italy" within the Italianate building.
The church remained in use until the late 20th century, but was declared redundant on 14 February 1990 because of declining attendance at services. The decline had set in several decades earlier, and the Diocese were considering demolition; the granting of Grade I-listed status on 24 March 1950 meant this could not happen. The Churches Conservation Trust now owns and maintains the building. Squatters caused damage during the 1990s, but restoration work in 2001 and 2002, costing more than £100,000, allowed the building to be reopened for occasional services, special events and community activities.
The church was always unparished, having been built as a chapel of ease to St Andrew's in Church Road.
Architecture.
The exterior, facing west, is the first example in England of the Italianate style being used on a church. Originally, the interior was less grand, with no chancel, simple pulpits and a single gallery, making it a plain, box-like preaching-house. The building materials used for the exterior are brick and ashlar. The entrance door is set beneath a round-headed arched opening between twin pilasters, the outer pair of which serve as quoins for the adjacent recessed walls. There is a small domed bell tower with a lead roof and clock faces, containing a bell cast in 1930 as a replacement for an early 19th-century predecessor (this bore an inscription dated 1811).
In its present form, the interior consists of a gallery at the west end, nave, transepts on two sides, a chancel, a side chapel in the southeast corner and a vestry in the northeast, with Italianate top-lighting and domes. The narthex, from where a stone staircase leads up to the gallery, is also top-lit, and now contains most of the church's memorial stones; these were moved there from the body of the church after it was declared redundant. Five, including memorials commemorating Lord Charles Somerset and Sir George Dallas, 1st Baronet, remain in the nave, however.
St Andrew's is the only church in Hove to have burial vaults beneath it. Space for burials was restricted in the Brunswick Town area by the time the church was built, because of the rapid residential development, and the churchyard at St Andrew's on Church Road was difficult to get to. Lord Charles Somerset, an M.P. who later became Governor of the Cape Colony in South Africa, was the first person to be buried in the vault, in 1831. A court order in 1854 prevented any more burials being made, and the vaults were used as air-raid shelters during World War II.

The Protocols of the Elders of Zion

The Protocols of the Elders of Zion or The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion is an antisemitic hoax purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination. It was first published in Russia in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century. Henry Ford funded printing of 500,000 copies that were distributed throughout the US in the 1920s.
Adolf Hitler and the Nazis publicized the text as though it were a valid document, although it had already been exposed as fraudulent. After the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, it ordered the text to be studied in German classrooms. The historian Norman Cohn suggested that Hitler used the "Protocols" as his primary justification for initiating the Holocaust—his "warrant for genocide".
The "Protocols" purports to document the minutes of a late 19th-century meeting of Jewish leaders discussing their goal of global Jewish hegemony by subverting the morals of Gentiles, and by controlling the press and the world's economies. It is still widely available today and even now sometimes presented as a genuine document, whether on the Internet or in print in numerous languages.
Creation.
Sources for the "Protocols".
The "Protocols" is a fabricated document purporting to be factual. It was originally produced in Russia between 1897 and 1903, possibly by Pyotr Ivanovich Rachkovsky, head of the Paris office of the Russian Secret Police, and unknown others.
Source material for the forgery consisted jointly of "Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu" or "Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu", an 1864 political satire by Maurice Joly and a chapter from "Biarritz", an 1868 novel by the antisemitic German novelist Hermann Goedsche, which had been translated into Russian in 1872.
A major source for the "Protocols" was "Der Judenstaat" by Theodor Herzl although, paradoxically, early Russian editions of the "Protocols" assert that they did not come from a Zionist organization. The text, which nowhere advocates for Zionism, resembles a parody of Herzl's ideas.
Literary forgery.
The "Protocols" uses the false document technique, which invents and inserts documents that appear to be factual. The reader, however, will know of the fictional origin of the work. "The Protocols" is one of the best-known and most-discussed examples of literary forgery, with analysis and proof of its fraudulent origin going as far back as 1921.
The forgery is an early example of "conspiracy theory" literature. Written mainly in the first person plural, the text includes generalizations, truisms and platitudes on how to take over the world: take control of the media and the financial institutions, change the traditional social order, etc. It does not contain specifics.
Maurice Joly.
Elements of the "Protocols" were plagiarized from Joly's fictional "Dialogue in Hell", a thinly veiled attack on the political ambitions of Napoleon III, who, represented by the non-Jewish character Machiavelli, plots to rule the world. Joly, a monarchist and legitimist, was imprisoned in France for 15 months as a direct result of his book's publication. Scholars have noted the irony that "Dialogue in Hell" was itself a plagiarism, at least in part, of a novel by Eugene Sue, "Les Mystères du Peuple" (1849–56).
Identifiable phrases from Joly constitute 4% of the first half of the first edition, and 12% of the second half; later editions, including most translations, have longer quotes from Joly.
"The Protocols" 1–19 closely follow the order of Maurice Joly's "Dialogues" 1–17. For example:
Philip Graves brought this plagiarism to light in a series of articles in "The Times" in 1921, the first published evidence that the "Protocols" was not an authentic document.
Hermann Goedsche.
"Goedsche was a postal clerk and a spy for the Prussian Secret Police. He had been forced to leave the postal work due to his part in forging evidence in the prosecution against the Democratic leader Benedict Waldeck in 1849." Following his dismissal, Goedsche began a career as a conservative columnist, and wrote literary fiction under the pen name Sir John Retcliffe. His 1868 novel "Biarritz" ("To Sedan") contains a chapter called "The Jewish Cemetery in Prague and the Council of Representatives of the Twelve Tribes of Israel." In it, Goedsche (who was unaware that only two of the original twelve Biblical "tribes" remained) depicts a clandestine nocturnal meeting of members of a mysterious rabbinical cabal that is planning a diabolical "Jewish conspiracy." At midnight, the Devil appears to contribute his opinions and insight. The chapter closely resembles a scene in Alexandre Dumas, père's "Giuseppe Balsamo" (1848), in which Joseph Balsamo a.k.a Alessandro Cagliostro and company plot the Affair of the Diamond Necklace. By 1871, this fictional story was being recounted in France as serious history.
In 1872 a Russian translation of "The Jewish Cemetery in Prague" appeared in St. Petersburg as a separate pamphlet of purported non-fiction. François Bournand, in his "Les Juifs et nos Contemporains" (1896), reproduced the soliloquy at the end of the chapter, in which the character Levit expresses as factual the wish that Jews be "kings of the world in 100 years" —crediting a "Chief Rabbi John Readcliff." Perpetuation of the myth of the authenticity of Goedsche's story, in particular the "Rabbi's speech", facilitated later accounts of the equally mythical authenticity of the "Protocols". Like the "Protocols", many asserted that the fictional "rabbi's speech" had a ring of authenticity, regardless of its origin: "This speech was published in our time, eighteen years ago," read an 1898 report in La Croix, "and all the events occurring before our eyes were anticipated in it with truly frightening accuracy."
Fictional events in Joly's "Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu", which appeared four years before "Biarritz", may well have been the inspiration for Goedsche's fictional midnight meeting, and details of the outcome of the supposed plot. Goedsche's chapter may have been an outright plagiarism of Joly, Dumas père, or both.
Structure and content.
The "Protocols" purports to document the minutes of a late-19th-century meeting attended by world Jewish leaders, the "Elders of Zion", who are conspiring to take over the world. The forgery places in the mouths of the Jewish leaders a variety of plans, most of which derive from older antisemitic canards. For example, the "Protocols" includes plans to subvert the morals of the non-Jewish world, plans for Jewish bankers to control the world's economies, plans for Jewish control of the press, and – ultimately – plans for the destruction of civilization. The document consists of twenty-four "protocols", which have been analyzed by Steven Jacobs and Mark Weitzman, and they documented several recurrent themes that appear repeatedly in the 24 protocols, as shown in the following table:
History.
Publication history.
"The Protocols" appeared in print in the Russian Empire as early as 1903. The antisemitic tract was published as a serialized set of articles in "Znamya", a Black Hundreds newspaper owned by Pavel Krushevan. It appeared again in 1905 as a final chapter (Chapter XII) of a second edition of "Velikoe v malom i antikhrist" (The Great in the Small & Antichrist), a book by Serge Nilus. In 1906, it appeared in pamphlet form edited by G. Butmi."
These first three (and subsequently more) Russian language imprints were published and circulated in the Russian Empire during the 1903–6 period as a tool for scapegoating Jews, blamed by the monarchists for the defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and the 1905 Russian Revolution. Common to all three texts is the idea that Jews aim for world domination. Since "The Protocols" are presented as merely a document, the front matter and back matter are needed to explain its alleged origin. The diverse imprints, however, are mutually inconsistent. The general claim is that the document was stolen from a secret Jewish organization. Since the alleged original stolen manuscript does not exist, one is forced to restore a purported original edition. This has been done by the Italian scholar, Cesare G. De Michelis in 1998, in a work which was translated into English and published in 2004, where he treats his subject as Apocrypha. As fiction in the genre of literature, the tract was further analyzed by Umberto Eco in his novel "Foucault's Pendulum" in 1988 (English translation in 1989), in 1994 in chapter 6, "Fictional Protocols", of his "Six Walks in the Fictional Woods" and in his 2010 novel The Cemetery of Prague.
As the 1917 Russian Revolution unfolded, causing white Russians to flee to the West, this text was carried along and assumed a new purpose. Until then "The Protocols" had remained obscure; it was now an instrument for blaming Jews for the Russian Revolution. It was now a tool, a political weapon used against the Bolshevikis who were depicted as overwhelmingly Jews, allegedly executing the "plan" embodied in "The Protocols". The purpose was to discredit the October Revolution, prevent the West from recognizing the Soviet Union, and bring the downfall of Vladimir Lenin's regime.
First Russian language editions.
Conspiracy references.
According to Daniel Pipes,
Pipes notes that the "Protocols" emphasizes recurring themes of conspiratorial antisemitism: "Jews always scheme", "Jews are everywhere", "Jews are behind every institution", "Jews obey a central authority, the shadowy 'Elders'", and "Jews are close to success."
"The Protocols" is widely considered influential in the development of other conspiracy theories, and reappears repeatedly in contemporary conspiracy literature, such as Jim Marrs' "Rule by Secrecy." Some recent editions proclaim that the "Jews" depicted in the Protocols are a cover identity for other conspirators such as the Illuminati, Freemasons, the Priory of Sion, or even, in the opinion of David Icke, "extra-dimensional entities."
Emergence in Russia.
The chapter "In the Jewish Cemetery in Prague" from Goedsche's "Biarritz", with its strong antisemitic theme containing the alleged rabbinical plot against the European civilization, was translated into Russian as a separate pamphlet in 1872. In 1921, Princess Catherine Radziwill gave a private lecture in New York. She claimed that the Protocols were a forgery compiled in 1904–5 by Russian journalists Matvei Golovinski and Manasevich-Manuilov at the direction of Pyotr Rachkovsky, Chief of the Russian secret service in Paris.
In 1944, German writer Konrad Heiden identified Golovinski as an author of the "Protocols". Radziwill's account was supported by Russian historian Mikhail Lepekhine, who published his findings in November 1999 in the French newsweekly "L'Express". Lepekhine considers the "Protocols" a part of a scheme to persuade Tsar Nicholas II that the modernization of Russia was really a Jewish plot to control the world. Stephen Eric Bronner writes that groups opposed to progress, parliamentarianism, urbanization, and capitalism, and an active Jewish role in these modern institutions, were particularly drawn to the antisemitism of the document. Ukrainian scholar offers extensive literary, historical and linguistic analysis of the original text of the "Protocols" and traces the influences of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's prose (in particular, "The Grand Inquisitor" and "The Possessed") on Golovinski's writings, including the "Protocols".
In his book "The Non-Existent Manuscript", Italian scholar Cesare G. De Michelis studies early Russian publications of the "Protocols". The "Protocols" were first mentioned in the Russian press in April 1902, by the Saint Petersburg newspaper "Novoye Vremya" ( – "The New Times"). The article was written by a famous conservative publicist as a part of his regular series "Letters to Neighbors" ("Письма к ближним") and was titled "Plots against Humanity". The author described his meeting with a lady (Yuliana Glinka, as it is known now) who, after telling him about her mystical revelations, implored him to get familiar with the documents later known as the "Protocols"; but after reading some excerpts, Menshikov became quite skeptical about their origin and did not publish them.
Krushevan and Nilus editions.
The "Protocols" were published at the earliest, in serialized form, from August 28 to September 7 (O.S.) 1903, in "Znamya", a Saint Petersburg daily newspaper, under Pavel Krushevan. Krushevan had initiated the Kishinev pogrom four months earlier.
In 1905, Sergei Nilus published the full text of the "Protocols" in "Chapter XII", the final chapter (pp 305–417), of the second edition (or third, according to some sources) of his book, "Velikoe v malom i antikhrist", which translates as "The Great within the Small: The Coming of the Anti-Christ and the Rule of Satan on Earth". He claimed it was the work of the First Zionist Congress, held in 1897 in Basel, Switzerland. When it was pointed out that the First Zionist Congress had been open to the public and was attended by many non-Jews, Nilus changed his story, saying the Protocols were the work of the 1902–3 meetings of the Elders, but contradicting his own prior statement that he had received his copy in 1901:
Stolypin's fraud investigation, 1905.
A subsequent secret investigation ordered by Pyotr Stolypin, the newly appointed chairman of the Council of Ministers, came to the conclusion that the "Protocols" first appeared in Paris in antisemitic circles around 1897–1898. When Nicholas II learned of the results of this investigation, he requested, "The Protocols should be confiscated, a good cause cannot be defended by dirty means." Despite the order, or because of the "good cause", numerous reprints proliferated.
"The Protocols" in the West.
In the United States, "The Protocols" are to be understood in the context of the First Red Scare (1917–20). The text circulated in 1919 in American government circles, specifically diplomatic and military, in typescript form, a copy of which is archived by the Hoover Institute. It also appeared in 1919 in the "Public Ledger" as a pair of serialized newspaper articles. But all references to "Jews" were replaced with references to "Bolsheviki" as an exposé by the journalist and subsequently highly respected Columbia University School of Journalism dean Carl W. Ackerman.
In 1923, there appeared an anonymously edited pamphlet by the Britons Publishing Society, a successor to The Britons, an entity created and headed by Henry Hamilton Beamish. This imprint was allegedly a translation by Victor E. Marsden, who died in October 1920.
Most versions substantially involve "protocols", or minutes of a speech given in secret involving Jews who are organized as Elders, or Sages, of Zion, and underlies 24 protocols that are supposedly followed by the Jewish people. "The Protocols" has been proven to be a literary forgery and hoax as well as a clear case of plagiarism.
English language imprints.
On October 27 and 28, 1919, the Philadelphia "Public Ledger" published excerpts of an English language translation as the "Red Bible," deleting all references to the purported Jewish authorship and re-casting the document as a Bolshevik manifesto. The author of the articles was the paper's correspondent at the time, Carl W. Ackerman, who later became the head of the journalism department at Columbia University. On May 8, 1920, an article in "The Times" followed German translation and appealed for an inquiry into what it called an "uncanny note of prophecy". In the leader (editorial) titled "The Jewish Peril, a Disturbing Pamphlet: Call for Inquiry", Wickham Steed wrote about "The Protocols":
Steed retracted his endorsement of The Protocols after they were exposed as a forgery.
United States.
In the US, Henry Ford sponsored the printing of 500,000 copies, and, from 1920 to 1922, published a series of antisemitic articles titled "The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem", in "The Dearborn Independent", a newspaper he owned. In 1921, Ford cited evidence of a Jewish threat: "The only statement I care to make about the "Protocols" is that they fit in with what is going on. They are 16 years old, and they have fitted the world situation up to this time." In 1927, however, the courts ordered Ford to retract his publication and apologize; he complied, claiming his assistants had duped him. He remained an admirer of Nazi Germany, however.
In 1934, an anonymous editor expanded the compilation with "Text and Commentary" (pp 136–41). The production of this uncredited compilation was a 300-page book, an inauthentic expanded edition of the twelfth chapter of Nilus's 1905 book on the coming of the anti-Christ. It consists of substantial liftings of excerpts of articles from Ford's antisemitic periodical "The Dearborn Independent". This 1934 text circulates most widely in the English-speaking world, as well as on the internet. The "Text and Commentary" concludes with a comment on Chaim Weizmann's October 6, 1920, remark at a banquet: "A beneficent protection which God has instituted in the life of the Jew is that He has dispersed him all over the world". Marsden, who was dead by then, is credited with the following assertion:
"The Times" exposes a forgery, 1921.
In 1920–21, the history of the concepts found in the "Protocols" was traced back to the works of Goedsche and Jacques Crétineau-Joly by Lucien Wolf (an English Jewish journalist), and published in London in August 1921. But a dramatic exposé occurred in the series of articles in "The Times" by its Constantinople reporter, Philip Graves, who discovered the plagiarism from the work of Maurice Joly.
According to writer Peter Grose, Allen Dulles, who was in Constantinople developing relationships in post-Ottoman political structures, discovered 'the source' of the documentation ultimately provided to "The Times". Grose writes that "The Times" extended a loan to the source, a Russian émigré who refused to be identified, with the understanding the loan would not be repaid. Colin Holmes, a lecturer in economic history of Sheffield University, identified the émigré as Michael Raslovleff, a self-identified antisemite, who gave the information to Graves so as not to "give a weapon of any kind to the Jews, whose friend I have never been."
In the first article of Graves' series, titled "A Literary Forgery", the editors of "The Times" wrote, "our Constantinople Correspondent presents for the first time conclusive proof that the document is in the main a clumsy plagiarism. He has forwarded us a copy of the French book from which the plagiarism is made." In the same year, an entire book documenting the hoax was published in the US by Herman Bernstein. Despite this widespread and extensive debunking, the "Protocols" continued to be regarded as important factual evidence by antisemites.
Middle East.
A translation made by an Arab Christian appeared in Cairo in 1927 or 1928, this time as a book. The first translation by an Arab Muslim was also published in Cairo, but only in 1951.
Switzerland.
The Berne Trial, 1934–1935.
The selling of the "Protocols" (edited by German antisemite Theodor Fritsch) by the National Front during a political manifestation in the Casino of Berne on June 13, 1933, led to the Berne Trial in the "Amtsgericht" (district court) of Berne, the capital of Switzerland, on October 29, 1934. The plaintiffs (the Swiss Jewish Association and the Jewish Community of Berne) were represented by Hans Matti and Georges Brunschvig, helped by Emil Raas. Working on behalf of the defense was German antisemitic propagandist Ulrich Fleischhauer. On May 19, 1935, two defendants (Theodore Fischer and Silvio Schnell) were convicted of violating a Bernese statute prohibiting the distribution of "immoral, obscene or brutalizing" texts while three other defendants were acquitted. The court declared the "Protocols" to be forgeries, plagiarisms, and obscene literature. Judge Walter Meyer, a Christian who had not heard of the "Protocols" earlier, said in conclusion,
Vladimir Burtsev, a Russian émigré, anti-Bolshevik and anti-Fascist who exposed numerous Okhrana agents provocateurs in the early 1900s, served as a witness at the Berne Trial. In 1938 in Paris he published a book, "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Proved Forgery", based on his testimony.
On November 1, 1937, the defendants appealed the verdict to the "Obergericht" (Cantonal Supreme Court) of Berne. A panel of three judges acquitted them, holding that the "Protocols", while false, did not violate the statute at issue because they were "political publications" and not "immoral (obscene) publications (Schundliteratur)" in the strict sense of the law. The presiding judge's opinion stated, though, that the forgery of the "Protocols" was not questionable and expressed regret that the law did not provide adequate protection for Jews from this sort of literature. The court refused to impose the fees of defense of the acquitted defendants to the plaintiffs, and the acquitted Theodor Fischer had to pay 100 Fr. to the total state costs of the trial (Fr. 28'000) that were eventually paid by the Canton of Berne. This decision gave grounds for later allegations that the appeal court "confirmed authenticity of the Protocols" which is contrary to the facts. A view favorable to the pro-Nazi defendants is reported in an appendix to Leslie Fry's "Waters Flowing Eastward". A more scholarly work on the trial is in a 139-page monograph by Urs Lüthi.
The Basel Trial.
A similar trial in Switzerland took place at Basel. The Swiss Frontists Alfred Zander and Eduard Rüegsegger distributed the "Protocols" (edited by the German Gottfried zur Beek) in Switzerland. Jules Dreyfus-Brodsky and Marcus Cohen sued them for insult to Jewish honor. At the same time, chief rabbi Marcus Ehrenpreis of Stockholm (who also witnessed at the Berne Trial) sued Alfred Zander who contended that Ehrenpreis himself had said that the "Protocols" were authentic (referring to the foreword of the edition of the "Protocols" by the German antisemite Theodor Fritsch). On June 5, 1936 these proceedings ended with a settlement.
Germany.
According to historian Norman Cohn, the assassins of German Jewish politician Walter Rathenau (1867–1922) were convinced that Rathenau was a literal "Elder of Zion".
The "Protocols" also became a part of the Nazi propaganda effort to justify persecution of the Jews. It was made required reading for German students. In "The Holocaust: The Destruction of European Jewry 1933–1945", Nora Levin states that "Hitler used the "Protocols" as a manual in his war to exterminate the Jews":
Hitler refers to the "Protocols" in "Mein Kampf":
Hitler endorsed it in his speeches from August 1921 on, and it was studied in German classrooms after the Nazis came to power. At the height of World War II, the Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels proclaimed: "The Zionist Protocols are as up-to-date today as they were the day they were first published." In Norman Cohn's words, it served as the Nazis' "warrant for genocide".
In contrast to Hitler's rantings, Nazi leader Erich von dem Bach-Zelewsky admitted:
German language publications.
Having fled the Ukraine in 1918–19, Piotr Shabelsky-Bork brought the Protocols to Ludwig Muller Von Hausen who then published them in German. Under the pseudonym Gottfried Zur Beek he produced the first and "by far the most important" German translation. It appeared in January 1920 as a part of a larger antisemitic tract dated 1919. After "The Times" discussed the book respectfully in May 1920 it became a bestseller. "The Hohenzollern family helped defray the publication costs, and Kaiser Wilhelm II had portions of the book read out aloud to dinner guests". Alfred Rosenberg's 1923 edition "gave a forgery a huge boost".
Italy.
Fascist politician Giovanni Preziosi published the first Italian edition of the "Protocols" in 1921. The book however had little impact until the mid-1930s. A new 1937 edition had a much higher impact, and three further editions in the following months sold 60,000 copies total. The fifth edition had an introduction by Julius Evola, which argued around the issue of forgery, stating: ""The problem of the authenticity of this document is secondary and has to be replaced by the much more serious and essential problem of its truthfulness"".
Modern era.
The "Protocols" continue to be widely available around the world, particularly on the internet, as well as in print in Japan, the Middle East, Asia, and South America.
Governments or political leaders in most parts of the world have not referred to the "Protocols" since World War II. The exception to this is the Middle East, where a large number of Arab and Muslim regimes and leaders have endorsed them as authentic, including endorsements from Presidents Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat of Egypt, one of the President Arifs of Iraq, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, and Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi of Libya. The 1988 charter of Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist group, states that "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" embodies the plan of the Zionists. Recent endorsements in the 21st century have been made by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Sheikh Ekrima Sa'id Sabri, the education ministry of Saudi Arabia, member of the Greek Parliament Ilias Kasidiaris, and young earth creationist and tax evader Kent Hovind.
In 2010, Italian philosopher and novelist Umberto Eco released his novel "The Cemetery of Prague" which contains a fictional account of the origin of "The Protocols" forgery.

Philippe Bertrand

Philippe Bertrand (1663–1724) was a French sculptor of the late 17th and early 18th century. He received commissions for sculptures for both the Château de Marly and Versailles. In November, 1701, he was made a full member of the Académie de peinture et de sculpture upon the display of a royal commission of 1700, his small bronze of the "Rape of Helen", a svelte composition of three figures with a debt to Giambologna's "Rape of a Sabine Woman". He was known for sculpting flowing, graceful, and even flying figures, particularly in his bronzes.
In 1714, when the choir of Notre-Dame was refurbished in academic Baroque manner, in Louis XIV's fulfillment of a vow made by Louis XIII, Bertrand was commissioned to provide a small allegorical bronze as the prize for a poetry competition on the occasion, organised by the Académie française to celebrate the completion of the project; it is conserved in the Wallace Collection, London.
Two further small collectors' bronzes by Bertrand are in the Royal Collection, "Psyche and Mercury" and "Prometheus Bound"; they are characteristic purchases of George IV.

Shu Chang (footballer)

Shu Chang () (born February 24, 1977) is a former Chinese football defender who played his entire career with Shandong Luneng. He was the captain of the club, which he has led to two China Super League titles in 2006 and 2008.
Club career.
Shu started his career in 1996 with Shandong Luneng where in his first season he would make 3 league appearances, which was then followed by a further 7 the following season. Under the Shandong Luneng Head coach Yin Tiesheng he would gradually establish himself as reliable central defender within the team, however it was the introduction of Slobodan Santrač as the teams new Head coach that saw Shu become a prominent member with the club that would win the league and cup double in the 1999 league season. Even after Santrač left Shu had firmly established himself as one of their most consistent players and would go on to become the clubs captain that oversaw them through some of their most successful periods in their history by winning several further league and cup trophies. After over a decade of consistency Shu would spend much of the 2009 league season on the bench due to injury. When he returned near the end of the season Liu Jindong would become the team captain and when the 2010 league started he was given a reserved position within the team with Liu remaining as captain.
International career.
After having a successful league season with Shandong Luneng Shu was given his chance to impress the Chinese Head coach Bora Milutinović in a friendly against Hong Kong on April 25, 2000 in a 1-0 victory. This was met with several further friendlies, however Shu found himself a fringe player within the team and was not called up to the 2000 AFC Asian Cup squad that went to Lebanon. After the tournament he was given another chance to claim a spot within the team for qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, however in the final friendly before the qualifiers China were defeated 3-0 to Sweden on February 17, 2001 and Shu was dropped from the squad. After several years out of the team Shu was given another chance to play for China when Chinese Head coach Arie Haan played him in a friendly against Finland on February 3, 2004 in a game China won 2-1, however this was to prove to be his last game for the team.

<doc id="19349826" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19349826" title="Retrospective diagnoses of autism">
Retrospective diagnoses of autism

A retrospective diagnosis is the practice of identifying an illness in a historical figure using modern knowledge, methods and disease classifications.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) were first identified by Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner in the 1940s, and it was not until many years later that they were formally recognised by the medical community. Journalists, academics and autism professionals have speculated that certain famous or notable historical people had autism or other autism spectrum disorders such as Asperger syndrome. Such speculation is controversial and little of it is undisputed. For example, several autism researchers speculate that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had autism or other conditions, while other researchers say there is not sufficient evidence to draw such conclusions.
Validity of retrospective diagnoses.
Michael Fitzgerald of the Department of Child Psychiatry at Trinity College, Dublin has written numerous books and articles on the subject, identifying over 30 individuals as possibly having AS. Ioan James is British mathematician who, in 2005, published "Asperger's Syndrome And High Achievement: Some Very Remarkable People", identifying a number of historic figures as autism candidates.
Speculation of this sort is, by necessity, based on reported behavior and anecdotal evidence rather than any clinical observation of the individual, and as such, is often controversial. Psychologist and author Oliver Sacks wrote that many of these claims seem "very thin at best", and Fred Volkmar, of the Yale Child Study Center, has remarked that "there is unfortunately a sort of cottage industry of finding that everyone has Asperger's". Michael Fitzgerald's research, in particular, has been heavily criticised, and described by some as "fudged pseudoscience" and "frankly absurd".
Specific individuals.
Isaac Newton (1643–1727), Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) and Albert Einstein (1879–1955) all died before Asperger syndrome became known, but Ioan James, Michael Fitzgerald, and Simon Baron-Cohen believe their personalities are consistent with those of people with Asperger syndrome. Tony Attwood has also named Einstein as a likely case of mild autism.
Not everyone agrees with these analyses. According to Oliver Sacks, the evidence that any one of these figures had autism "seems very thin at best". Glen Elliott, a psychiatrist at the University of California at San Francisco, is unconvinced that either Newton or Einstein had Asperger syndrome, particularly due to the unreliability of diagnoses based on biographical information. Elliot stated that there are a variety of causes that could explain the behaviour in question, and points out that Einstein is known to have had a good sense of humour, a trait that, according to Elliot, is "virtually unknown in people with severe Asperger syndrome".
Isaac Newton.
Isaac Newton hardly spoke and had few friends. He was often so absorbed in his work that he forgot to eat, demonstrating an obsessive single-mindedness that is commonly associated with Asperger's. If nobody attended his lessons, he reportedly gave lectures to an empty room. When he was 50, he suffered a nervous breakdown brought on by depression and paranoia. After Newton's death, however, his body was found to contain massive amounts of mercury, probably from his alchemical pursuits, which could have accounted for his eccentricity in later life.
Nikola Tesla.
In Nikola Tesla's autobiography, "My Inventions", he claims to have the ability to "visualize with the greatest facility", allowing him to fully design and test his inventions in his mind:
Tesla also displayed other unusual behaviours; he was very sensitive to touch, had an acute sense of hearing and sight, was obsessed with the number three and pigeons, was disgusted by jewelery and overweight people, and had several eating compulsions.
Albert Einstein.
Albert Einstein is sometimes thought to have had Asperger syndrome, despite forming close relationships with a number of people, marrying twice, and being outspoken on political issues. According to Baron-Cohen, "passion, falling in love and standing up for justice are all perfectly compatible with Asperger syndrome", although he notes that Einstein's delayed language development and educational slowness may be more indicative of high-functioning autism.
Fitzgerald describes Einstein's interest in physics as "an addiction", and says that it was important for him to be in control of his life. He also points to Einstein's lack of tact and social empathy, and his occasional naivety, as further traits he had in common with people with autism spectrum disorders. Ioan James adds that Einstein was much better at processing visual information than verbal; Einstein himself once said "I rarely think in words at all".
In her 1995 book "In a World of His Own: A Storybook About Albert Einstein", author Illana Katz notes that Einstein "was a loner, solitary, suffered from major tantrums, had no friends and didn't like being in crowds", and conjectures that he may have had some form of autism.

And Winter Came…

And Winter Came... is the seventh studio album from Irish musician Enya. The album was announced by Enya via her official site on 12 September 2008, and was released on 7 November 2008. The songs on the album primarily have a Christmas or winter theme. Since its release, the album has sold more than 3 million copies.
Songs.
The album consists of 12 tracks: ten English songs, which are all original compositions, plus "Oíche Chiúin" being sung in Irish and '"Oh Come, Oh Come Emmanuel" in English and Latin. A couple of tracks of the new album are reworked versions of songs that Enya released in the past: "Oíche Chiúin" is a re-recording of a song that she released for the first time back in 1988, originally as a b-side of the "Evening Falls" single; "And Winter Came..." is a reworked version of the song "Midnight Blue", which had previously been released in 2001, originally as a b-side of the "Wild Child" single.
An announcement on Enya's official website, www.enya.com, on 18 September 2008 confirmed that the first single of the album, which was to be released on 7 November of that year, was "Trains and Winter Rains". However, unlike most "Enya" albums of the past, which have spawned one or more CD singles, often with non-album bonus tracks, there has to date been no release of any singles from this album on physical media.
Promotional releases.
All of the promos for these releases had the album edit of the song, except "Trains and Winter Rains", which had the radio edit of the song.

<doc id="19349845" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19349845" title="Cryopreservation">
Cryopreservation

Cryopreservation or cryoconservation is a process where cells, whole tissues, or any other substances susceptible to damage caused by chemical reactivity or time are preserved by cooling to sub-zero temperatures. At low enough temperatures, any enzymatic or chemical activity which might cause damage to the material in question is effectively stopped. Cryopreservation methods seek to reach low temperatures without causing additional damage caused by the formation of ice during freezing. Traditional cryopreservation has relied on coating the material to be frozen with a class of molecules termed cryoprotectants. New methods are constantly being investigated due to the inherent toxicity of many cryoprotectants.
Natural cryopreservation.
Water-bears (Tardigrada), microscopic multicellular organisms, can survive freezing by replacing most of their internal water with the sugar trehalose, preventing it from crystallization that otherwise damages cell membranes. Mixtures of solutes can achieve similar effects. Some solutes, including salts, have the disadvantage that they may be toxic at intense concentrations. In addition to the water-bear, wood frogs can tolerate the freezing of their blood and other tissues. Urea is accumulated in tissues in preparation for overwintering, and liver glycogen is converted in large quantities to glucose in response to internal ice formation. Both urea and glucose act as "cryoprotectants" to limit the amount of ice that forms and to reduce osmotic shrinkage of cells. Frogs can survive many freeze/thaw events during winter if not more than about 65% of the total body water freezes. Research exploring the phenomenon of "Freezing frogs" has been performed primarily by the Canadian researcher, Dr. Kenneth B. Storey.
Freeze tolerance, in which organisms survive the winter by freezing solid and ceasing life functions, is known in a few vertebrates: five species of frogs ("Rana sylvatica", "Pseudacris triseriata", "Hyla crucifer", "Hyla versicolor", "Hyla chrysoscelis"), one of salamanders ("Hynobius keyserlingi"), one of snakes ("Thamnophis sirtalis") and three of turtles ("Chrysemys picta", "Terrapene carolina", "Terrapene ornata"). Snapping turtles "Chelydra serpentina" and wall lizards "Podarcis muralis" also survive nominal freezing but it has not been established to be adaptive for overwintering. In the case of "Rana sylvatica" one cryopreservant is ordinary glucose, which increases in concentration by approximately 19 mmol/l when the frogs are cooled slowly.
History.
One of the most important early theoreticians of cryopreservation was James Lovelock (born 1919) of Gaia theory fame. He suggested that damage to red blood cells during freezing was due to osmotic stress. Lovelock during the early 1950s had also suggested that increasing salt concentrations in a cell as it dehydrates to lose water to the external ice might cause damage to the cell. Cryopreservation of tissue during recent times began with the freezing of fowl sperm, which during 1957 was cryopreserved by a team of scientists in the UK directed by Christopher Polge. The process was applied to humans during the 1950s with pregnancies obtained after insemination of frozen sperm. However, the rapid immersion of the samples in liquid nitrogen did not, for certain of these samples – such as types of embryos, bone marrow and stem cells – produce the necessary viability to make them usable after thawing. Increased understanding of the mechanism of freezing injury to cells emphasised the importance of controlled or slow cooling to obtain maximum survival on thawing of the living cells. A controlled rate cooling process, allowing biological samples to equilibrate to optimal physical parameters osmotically in a cryoprotectant (a form of anti-freeze) before cooling in a predetermined, controlled way proved necessary. The ability of cryoprotectants, in the early cases glycerol, to protect cells from freezing injury was discovered accidentally. Freezing injury has two aspects–- direct damage from the ice crystals and secondary damage caused by the increase in concentration of solutes as progressively more ice is formed. During 1963 Peter Mazur, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the USA, demonstrated that lethal intracellular freezing could be avoided if cooling was slow enough to permit sufficient water to leave the cell during progressive freezing of the extracellular fluid. That rate differs between cells of differing size and water permeability: a typical cooling rate around 1°C/minute is appropriate for many mammalian cells after treatment with cryoprotectants such as glycerol or dimethyl sulphoxide, but the rate is not a universal optimum.
Temperature.
Cryogenic storage at very cold temperatures is presumed to provide an indefinite longevity to cells, although the actual effective life is rather difficult to prove. Researchers experimenting with dried seeds found that there was noticeable variability of deterioration when samples were kept at different temperatures – even ultra-cold temperatures. Temperatures less than the glass transition point (Tg) of polyol's water solutions, around , seem to be accepted as the range where biological activity very substantially slows, and , the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, is the preferred temperature for storing important specimens. While refrigerators, freezers and extra-cold freezers are used for many items, generally the ultra-cold of liquid nitrogen is required for successful preservation of the more complex biological structures to virtually stop all biological activity.
Risks.
Phenomena which can cause damage to cells during cryopreservation mainly occur during the freezing stage, and include: solution effects, extracellular ice formation, dehydration and intracellular ice formation. Many of these effects can be reduced by cryoprotectants.
Once the preserved material has become frozen, it is relatively safe from further damage. However, estimates based on the accumulation of radiation-induced DNA damage during cryogenic storage have suggested a maximum storage period of 1000 years.
Main methods to prevent risks.
The main techniques to prevent cryopreservation damages are a well established combination of "controlled rate and slow freezing" and a newer flash-freezing process known as "vitrification".
Slow programmable freezing.
"Controlled-rate and slow freezing", also known as "slow programmable freezing (SPF)", is a set of well established techniques developed during the early 1970s which enabled the first human embryo frozen birth Zoe Leyland during 1984. Since then, machines that freeze biological samples using programmable sequences, or controlled rates, have been used all over the world for human, animal and cell biology – 'freezing down' a sample to better preserve it for eventual thawing, before it is frozen, or cryopreserved, in liquid nitrogen. Such machines are used for freezing oocytes, skin, blood products, embryo, sperm, stem cells and general tissue preservation in hospitals, veterinary practices and research laboratories around the world. As an example, the number of live births from frozen embryos 'slow frozen' is estimated at some 300,000 to 400,000 or 20% of the estimated 3 million in vitro fertilisation (IVF) births.
Lethal intracellular freezing can be avoided if cooling is slow enough to permit sufficient water to leave the cell during progressive freezing of the extracellular fluid. That rate differs between cells of differing size and water permeability: a typical cooling rate of about 1°C/minute is appropriate for many mammalian cells after treatment with cryoprotectants such as glycerol or dimethyl sulphoxide, but the rate is not a universal optimum. The 1°C / minute rate can be achieved by using devices such as a rate-controlled freezer or a benchtop portable freezing container such as CoolCell®.
Several independent studies have provided evidence that frozen embryos stored using slow-freezing techniques may in some ways be 'better' than fresh in IVF. The studies were presented at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine conference in San Francisco, USA, 2008. The studies indicate that using frozen embryos rather than fresh embryos reduced the risk of stillbirth and premature delivery though the exact reasons are still being explored.
Vitrification.
Researchers Greg Fahy and William F. Rall helped introduce vitrification to reproductive cryopreservation in the mid-1980s. As of 2000, researchers claim vitrification provides the benefits of cryopreservation without damage due to ice crystal formation. For clinical cryopreservation, vitrification usually requires the addition of cryoprotectants prior to cooling. The cryoprotectants act like antifreeze: they decrease the freezing temperature. They also increase the viscosity. Instead of crystallizing, the syrupy solution becomes an amorphous ice—it "vitrifies". Rather than a phase change from liquid to solid by crystallization, the amorphous state is like a "solid liquid", and the transformation is over a small temperature range described as the "glass transition" temperature.
Vitrification of water is promoted by rapid cooling, and can be achieved without cryoprotectants by an extremely rapid decrease of temperature (megakelvins per second). The rate that is required to attain glassy state in pure water was considered to be impossible until 2005.
Two conditions usually required to allow vitrification are an increase of the viscosity and a decrease of the freezing temperature. Many solutes do both, but larger molecules generally have larger effect, particularly on viscosity. Rapid cooling also promotes vitrification.
For established methods of cryopreservation, the solute must penetrate the cell membrane in order to achieve increased viscosity and decrease freezing temperature inside the cell. Sugars do not readily permeate through the membrane. Those solutes that do, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, a common cryoprotectant, are often toxic in intense concentration. One of the difficult compromises of vitrifying cryopreservation concerns limiting the damage produced by the cryoprotectant itself due to cryoprotectant toxicity. Mixtures of cryoprotectants and the use of ice blockers have enabled the Twenty-First Century Medicine company to vitrify a rabbit kidney to -135°C with their proprietary vitrification mixture. Upon rewarming, the kidney was transplanted successfully into a rabbit, with complete functionality and viability, able to sustain the rabbit indefinitely as the sole functioning kidney.
Cells Alive System freezers.
The makers of Cells Alive System, a programmable freezer originally designed for food storage, claim that the survival of conventionally frozen periodontal ligament cells is improved by the application of a combination of a 0.1 mT magnetic field oscillating at 60 Hz, an induced electric field, and mechanical and thermal vibrations.
Freezable tissues.
Generally, cryopreservation is easier for thin samples and small clumps of individual cells, because these can be cooled more quickly and so require lesser doses of toxic cryoprotectants. Therefore, cryopreservation of human livers and hearts for storage and transplant is still impractical.
Nevertheless, suitable combinations of cryoprotectants and regimes of cooling and rinsing during warming often allow the successful cryopreservation of biological materials, particularly cell suspensions or thin tissue samples. Examples include:
Additionally, efforts are underway to preserve humans cryogenically, known as cryonics. For such efforts either the brain within the head or the entire body may experience the above process. Cryonics is in a different category from the aforementioned examples, however: while countless cryopreserved cells, vaccines, tissue and other biologial samples have been thawed and used successfully, this has not yet been the case at all for cryopreserved brains or bodies. At issue are the criteria for defining "success". Proponents of cryonics claim that cryopreservation using present technology, particularly vitrification of the brain, may be sufficient to preserve people in an "information theoretic" sense so that they could be revived and made whole by hypothetical vastly advanced future technology.
Embryos.
Cryopreservation for embryos are used for "embryo storage", e.g. when in vitro fertilization has resulted in more embryos than is currently needed.
Pregnancies have been reported from embryos stored for 16 years. Many studies have evaluated the children born from frozen embryos, or “frosties”. The result has been uniformly positive with no increase of birth defects or development abnormalities. A study of more than 11,000 cryopreserved human embryos had no significant effect of storage time on post-thaw survival for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or oocyte donation cycles, or for embryos frozen at the pronuclear or cleavage stages. Additionally, the duration of storage did not have any significant effect on clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, implantation, or live birth rate, whether from IVF or oocyte donation cycles. Rather, oocyte age, survival proportion, and number of transferred embryos are predictors of pregnancy outcome.
Ovarian tissue.
Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is of interest to women who want to preserve their reproductive function beyond the natural limit, or whose reproductive potential is threatened by cancer therapy, for example in hematologic malignancies or breast cancer. The procedure is to take a part of the ovary and perform slow freezing before storing it in liquid nitrogen whilst therapy is undertaken. Tissue can then be thawed and implanted near the fallopian, either orthotopic (on the natural location) or heterotopic (on the abdominal wall), where it starts to produce new eggs, allowing normal conception to occur. The ovarian tissue may also be transplanted into mice that are immunocompromised (SCID mice) to avoid graft rejection, and tissue can be harvested later when mature follicles have developed.
Oocytes.
Human "Oocyte cryopreservation" is a new technology in which a woman’s eggs (oocytes) are extracted, frozen and stored. Later, when she is ready to become pregnant, the eggs can be thawed, fertilized, and transferred to the uterus as embryos.
Semen.
Semen can be used successfully almost indefinitely after cryopreservation. The longest reported successful storage is 22 years. It can be used for sperm donation where the recipient wants the treatment in a different time or place, or for men undergoing a vasectomy to have the option to have children.
Testicular tissue.
Cryopreservation of immature testicular tissue is a developing method to avail reproduction to young boys who need to have gonadotoxic therapy. Animal data are promising, since healthy offsprings have been obtained after transplantation of frozen testicular cell suspensions or tissue pieces. However, none of the fertility restoration options from frozen tissue, i.e. cell suspension transplantation, tissue grafting and in vitro maturation (IVM) has proved efficient and safe in humans as yet.
Moss.
Cryopreservation of whole moss plants, especially Physcomitrella patens, has been developed by Ralf Reski and coworkers and is performed at the International Moss Stock Center. This biobank collects, preserves, and distributes moss mutants and moss ecotypes.

Fashion line

A fashion line is a clothing subsidiary (usually maintained by a parent company) that designs and sells garments according to a specific ethos, often only slightly different than the company's flagship brand. A single designer or creative director will often be in charge of many lines, each presenting a different take on the company or brand's main idea. A few notable fashion lines include: Abercrombie and Fitch, Aeropostale and American Eagle Outfitters.
Many mainstream brands (Gap, Banana Republic, Brooks Brothers) will use various (sub-)labels to differentiate their more expensive garments from the more common (e.g. Gap's 1964, Brooks' 1818 Collection), but these do not constitute lines per se. A fashion line will have its own retail outlets, design staff, offices, and often, catalogs.

Spoons sex position

The spoons position or spooning is a sexual position and a cuddling technique. The name derives from the way that two spoons may be positioned side by side, with bowls aligned.
In the sexual spoons position, the penetrative partner lies on one side, with knees bent. The receptive partner also lies on the same side, with back pressed against the penetrative partner's front. Both partners' upper bodies may be pressed together or separated with just the pelvises connecting, and their legs can also rest on top of each other. The receptive partner may have to lift the upper knee to allow for easier penetration. This has been called one of the "Basic Four" sex positions.
This rear-entry position allows for a great deal of physical intimacy, as there is full-body contact which allows for cuddling. The man (outer spoon) can caress the woman's stomach and breasts, as well as the back of the neck and ears, while stimulating the clitoris if desired. The woman can also stimulate her own clitoris or her partner's scrotum. In addition, the penis stimulates the front of the vagina or the G-Spot. Along with the doggy style position, this is probably the best position from which to reach the G-Spot. Both partners have control of the angle and depth of penetration, and slow, low-intensity sex can last for a long time because it usually takes longer for the man to reach orgasm. Anal sex is also possible in this position, along with use of a vibrator. However, there is little visual stimulation for either partner, as they are not facing one another and cannot see each other's bodies fully. The penis can also slip out easily. Variations on this position include the partners lying on their sides face-to-face or in the "scissors" position.
The spoons position may be preferable for couples who have just woken up or are very tired. It may be used if the woman is pregnant, even during the last trimester, because it does not put any pressure on the abdomen. It is also good for those recovering from illness or surgery, or the elderly, because it puts less strain on muscles.
Most Roman erotic art depicted couples in the spoons position.

The High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests is a position established by the Normans in England.
The High Sheriff is the oldest secular office under the Crown. Formerly the High Sheriff was the principal law enforcement officer in the county but over the centuries most of the responsibilities associated with the post have been transferred elsewhere or are now defunct, so that its functions are now largely ceremonial. The High Sheriff changes every March.

Sunnyside railway station

The Sunnyside railway station was a railway station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, formerly located at King and Queen Streets near Roncesvalles Avenue. It operated passenger service from 1910 until 1971. 
History.
The Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) had operated rail lines along the lakeshore of Toronto since 1850. The lines encountered a steep hill into the Parkdale area of Toronto, from the west. In the first decade of the 1900s, the GTR operated the South Parkdale railway station at the intersection of Jameson Avenue and Springhurst Avenue. In 1910, the GTR embarked on a project to create a cut through the Parkdale neighbourhood, eliminating the grade. The railway decided to close the South Parkdale station and build a new one at the foot of King, Queen Street West and Roncesvalles Avenue in the area commonly known as 'Sunnyside'.
The company built a temporary station, opening service in 1910. A permanent station was completed in 1912. It was situated at street level at the King and Queen Streets intersection. The ticket office and waiting area was at street level, and passengers would walk down staircases to track level. A separate bridge would pass over the tracks for passengers travelling east-bound.
The grade elimination project also removed a level crossing of Queen Street to the Lakeshore Road. The following year a roadway bridge was built over the tracks immediately to the west of the station to connect the Sunnyside intersection with Lakeshore Road. The bridge was eventually demolished in the 1950s to build the Gardiner Expressway project.
The location was well-suited to access to the popular Sunnyside Amusement Park located nearby and streetcar routes nearby. A coach station was built across the street in the 1930s providing access to motor coaches of the Gray Coach bus lines. The Edgewater Hotel was built next to the bus station on the north-west corner of the intersection in the 1930s.
The rail lines and service was amalgamated into Canadian National Railways around 1920. Inter-city passenger trains stopped at Sunnyside until 1971 and the station buildings were demolished in 1973.

Cow and Chicken

Cow and Chicken is an American animated comedy television series created by David Feiss for Cartoon Network. The series follows the surreal adventures of a cow, named Cow, and her chicken brother, named Chicken. They are often antagonized by "The Red Guy", who poses as various characters to scam them. Late into the series run, the characters I.M. Weasel and I.R. Baboon, who were part of the series' recurring segment, "I Am Weasel", were given their own half-hour series of the same name.
Like "Dexter's Laboratory" and some other Cartoon Network series from the 1990s, the original pilot appeared as an episode of the animated shorts showcase project "What a Cartoon!", the brainchild of Fred Seibert, then-president of Hanna-Barbera. The "Cow and Chicken" series first broadcast on Cartoon Network from July 15, 1997, to July 24, 1999, with reruns airing prominently on the network until April 2006. Reruns are played on Boomerang, which are rated TV-Y7. The series was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1996 and 1998.
Premise.
The program focuses on the misadventures of two unlikely yet somehow biological siblings; the sweet-natured, dim, ecstatic anthropomorphic Cow and her cynical elder brother Chicken. The series is set in an eccentric, surreal environment and humored with laughably grotesque, repulsive comedy and animation, and revolves around the surreal, strange escapades experienced by Cow and Chicken that are often triggered by their odd, naked enemy the Red Guy.
The humor and storylines depicted in the series are sometimes based around traditional childhood worries, anxieties, or phobias such as cooties or venturing into the girls' restroom, but enhanced comically. Other characters include Chicken and Cow's slightly delirious, dimwitted human parents that are only seen from their legs down (even in scenes where showing nothing more would be ridiculous), and Chicken's two best friends Flem and Earl, along with the appropriately-named cousin, Boneless Chicken.
History.
The idea of Cow and Chicken first existed as a story that David Feiss had made for his daughter. Feiss was a cartoonist who had worked with Hanna-Barbera and related projects since 1978.
Later, Feiss was called to submit any ideas he had for the series "What a Cartoon!", a series composed of various cartoon shorts from various creators and writers. Feiss submitted three ideas for the series to Larry Huber, the series' executive producer. One of the ideas was "Cow and Chicken". Cow and Chicken premiered on the "What a Cartoon!" series in 1995. Although most cartoons in the series had never gone beyond one short, Hanna-Barbera had decided to turn "Cow and Chicken" into a full series (possibly since the Emmy Award nomination of the original short), following many letters from fans asking for more "Cow and Chicken" cartoons.
The "Cow and Chicken" series premiered on July 15, 1997, in the United States, although the first season was originally shown on Cartoon Network in Europe earlier that year. The series ran for 52 episodes through 1999. Reruns continued to be shown on Cartoon Network until April 10, 2006. As a supporting segment, the show included a cartoon called "I Am Weasel"; this segment was spun off as an independent series late in the show's run. Typically, an episode would consist of two seven-minute "Cow and Chicken" shorts playing back-to-back, then followed by a seven-minute "I Am Weasel" short before the end credits. The exception to this structure was episode 105 ("The Ugliest Weenie"), which had the "Weasel" short ("I Are Big Star") play in-between the two "Cow and Chicken" shorts, possibly because said shorts were one storyline.
"Cow and Chicken" was notable in that a single actor, Charlie Adler, voiced three leading roles of Cow, Chicken, and the Red Guy (much like how Mel Blanc voiced many characters in the Warner Brothers' Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes series). Other actors provided supporting voices, including Candi Milo and Dee Bradley Baker as Mom and Dad, and Dan Castellaneta and veteran actor Howard Morris as Earl and Flem. David Feiss himself did the voice of a clown in an episode called "The Great Pantzini". Additional voices in various episodes were provided by Will Ferrell, Tom Kenny, Jill Talley, Dom Deluise, Michael Gough, Pamela Segall Adlon, Richard Gautier and many others.
Because the Hindu religion considers the cow a sacred animal, the series was replaced by "Tom and Jerry" in India.
Episodes.
"Cow and Chicken" has a total of 52 episodes in 4 seasons that were produced from November 1996 to April 1999. Each half-hour contains 2 "Cow and Chicken" and 1 "I Am Weasel" segment.
Humor.
"Cow and Chicken" drew on several types of cartoon humor through its run. The series often made use of cartoon violence; Cow and Chicken were frequently placed in dangerous situations and the Red Guy was frequently pummeled and beaten (usually by Supercow). The series also made fun of the clichés of cartoons. For example, Cow has an alter-ego: Supercow, who is a superhero with different characteristics to her normal character (such as flight, and the ability to speak Spanish); and the Red Guy tries in vain to discover Supercow's secret identity so he can "die happy".
Another cliché made fun of in the series is that the children's parents, who are called Mom and Dad by everyone, exist only from the waist down, and can be seen to stop at the waist (whenever their shadows appear, they are cut off at the waist). A picture even exists on the wall of the parents from the waist down. Cow can disguise herself as Dad simply by wearing Dad's pants. This makes fun of the idea of partially unseen characters and cartoons in which adults are seen only from the waist down (e.g. "Muppet Babies"). Many jokes of the series use adolescent humor, which made the show somewhat controversial.
Recurring jokes and gags.
In some episodes, the missing upper bodies of Cow and Chicken's parents are used as a gag. For example, in one episode ("No Smoking") which was banned, the cartoon "camera" accidentally zooms out too far, and shows Mom and Dad cut off at the waist. In another episode ("Cow and Chicken Reclining"), Cow and Chicken search through a closet by throwing out everything inside, and for a small moment, the upper (human) bodies which are rumored to be the bodies Mom and Dad are visible as part of a discarded science project by Cow (however, considering the absurdist nature of the show's humor, this may be a throwaway gag).
They are occasionally seen driving a car with their feet, writing and grabbing on to things with their toes, and dialling a phone by kicking the numbers. Mom and Dad's shadows are shown as being cut off at the waist in several episodes like "Cow and Chicken Reclining". Mama's body can be seen cut clearly in one scene when she laughs sitting on a TV in the episode "Which Came First?". A picture even exists on the wall of the parents from the waist down. In one episode, Cow disguises herself as Dad by wearing his pants, which nearly cover Cow's face. They were also seen in their only-legs form in the I Am Weasel episode "Who Rubbed Out Cow and Chicken?".
Whenever the scene showed Cow and Chicken in the school cafeteria they always ordered "pork butts and taters."
When disguised, The Red Guy often is without pants or disguise names reflect this in puns or more literal references such as "Mr. Likenopants", "Officer Pantsoffski", "Mrs. Bare Derriere", "Ivan Panced", "Lance Sackless", "Ben Panced," "Rear Admiral Floyd", "The Great Pantsini", "Larry Lackapants", "Mr. Jeans Begone", "Dr. Laxslax" and "Dr./Mr./Prof. Heiniebottom"; Supercow will refer to the Red Guy's incarnations as "El Diablo sin pantalones" (literally, "the Devil without pants").
Within the show, the characters often refer to everyone else as ladies, girls, gals, or men, regardless of their gender, as well as constantly peppering their speech with malapropisms and using sarcasm.
Mom and Dad will often say things to imply or outright say they are of the opposite gender. ("It's time you started off your day like a man. Just like Momma!")
The show often breaks the fourth wall. I Am Weasel exists as a cartoon in the fictional world of Cow and Chicken, however, this is contradicted in "I.R. In Wrong Cartoon" (a crossover between the two cartoons), when the Red Guy, disguised as a bearskin rug, says to Cow when she wants to take Weasel out of the TV to make him real, "He's just as real as you and I." In "The Laughing Puddle", when the entire population of Folsom has gone into the titular puddle, Chicken states, "Is anything in this cartoon ever going to make sense?" A few times throughout the series, some characters (usually the Red Guy) request for the cartoon to end.
Controversy.
The segment "Buffalo Gals", which aired initially on February 20, 1998, along with the follow-up segment "Cow and Chicken Reclining," was banned by Cartoon Network because of its innuendos implying that the Buffalo Gals were lesbians and its stereotyping of lesbians. The episode contained obvious sexual humor, which includes Mom's line "Oh, the Buffalo Gals, a motorcycle riding gang that randomly bursts into people's homes and chews on their carpet.", the name of one of the bikers being "Munch Kelly," the Buffalo Gals singing "Buffalo Gals" ("Buffalo gals, won't you come out tonight?"), and the Buffalo Gals playing softball and talking about "pitching" and "catching", slang terms for gay sex. The episode aired only once, and was replaced with the episode "Orthodontic Police" in future airings.
Other media.
The two main characters, Cow and Chicken, made cameo appearances as aliens in "". They were the second Cartoon Network characters to make cameo appearances in the "Ben 10" franchise, Billy from "The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy" being the first. Adler reprised his roles for the cameo.
During the "Mad" episode "Once Upon a Toon" Cow and Chicken are among the many classic cartoon characters being reunited in a spoof of ABC's "Once Upon a Time".
DVD releases.
"Cow and Chicken: Season 1", a two-disc set featuring the complete first season which contains 13 complete episodes, was released by Madman Entertainment in Australia (Region 4 PAL) on September 12, 2007. "Season 2" came out on February 10, 2010, by the same company in Australia. The entire series got released on DVD in Thailand as 4 season sets, containing Thai and English audio. The banned segment "Buffalo Gals" is missing from these releases.
American releases

Familija

Familija (Serbian Cyrillic: Фамилија; trans. "Family") was a Serbian rock supergroup from Belgrade, consisting of Vampiri, Košava and U Škripcu members. The band's musical style was a combination of ska, pop, ethnic and rock music.
History.
The band was founded in late 1993 by U Škripcu members Aleksandar "Vasa" Vasiljević (guitar) Aleksandar "Luka" Lukić (bass) and Ratko Ljubičić (drums) along with former Vampiri members Dejan "Peja" Pejović (vocals), Dejan "Dexy" Petrović (vocals) and drummer/percussionist Goran "Gedža" Redžepi. 
In February 1994 the band began recording their debut album, "Narodno pozorište" ("People's Theatre"), released by PGP-RTS later during the year. Pejović, Vasiljević, Lukić and Petrović wrote all the songs, featuring various musical styles combined with pop rock sound. The album featured the hits "Baltazar" (whose chorus referred to "Professor Balthazar" theme song), "Mala, mala", "Što ja volim taj seks" and "Nije mi ništa". The track "Trajna Nina" featured lyrics from the Beatles track "Yellow Submarine". The record was produced by Đorđe Petrović who also played keyboards. Vinyl LP and compact cassette editions sleeves were designed by Saša "Madoženja" Marković, while the CD edition featured sleeve art by Branko Lukić. The band also appeared in Srđan Dragojević's movie "Dva sata kvalitetnog TV programa" as one of the performers at the New Year’s Eve party.
Ratko Ljubučić and Goran Redžepi left the band in late 1995 and early 1996 respectively and the band kept hiring various drummers for their future recording sessions and live performances. During mid-1996 the band released a CD single featuring two songs, "Ringišpil" (taken from the album "Narodno pozorište") and "Brate Murate", a newly recorded song featuring Marko Milivojević on drums and produced by Saša Habić. The single was released through Komuna Belgrade.
The band's second album "Seljačka buna" ("Peasants' Uprising") was released in May 1997. Apart from the track "Brate Murate" (also included in the tracklist), the rest of the album was again produced by Đorđe Petrović in the band's signature eclectic style, featuring additional hits "Paranoja" and "Boli me kita". Petar "Zver" Radmilović played the drum tracks in the studio, while the following live performances were played with Branko Popović on drums.
The band broke up in early 1998. In 2000, Slovenian record label Taped Pictures released a various artists compilation featuring the band's song "Mala, mala".
Post breakup.
Dejan Petrović formed the band Centrala with his brother Nenad (Mušterije member). The band's style was a combination of electronic music and rock. The band is currently on hiatus.
Pejović formed The Dibidus in 2003 with former Hush bass guitarist Milan Sarić and former Deca Loših Muzičara guitarist Jova Jović. On their live performances, The Dibidus perform Familija songs, and their 2013 live album "Uživo iz kluba "Fest"" ("Live from the Club Fest") featured five songs originally recorded by Familija.
In 2006, Vasiljević and Lukić rejoined the rest of the original U Škripcu members at the Delča & Sklekovi concert held at Dom Omladine in Belgrade. In 2009 Lukić formed a Manu Chao and The Clash influenced band Radio Gerila.
Legacy.
In 2011, "Što ja volim taj seks" was polled, by the listeners of Radio 202, one of 60 greatest songs released by PGP-RTB/PGP-RTS during the sixty years of the label's existence.

Bicentennial Greenbelt Park

Bicentennial Greenbelt Park is a public park located in downtown Maryville, Tennessee.
History.
Bicentennial Park was an urban renewal project of the City of Maryville during the period leading up to the US Bicentennial in 1976.
The intent was to redevelop an area that had been home to light industrial activity and heavy pollution into a green space with walkways, picnic tables and an exercise course. The heavily polluted Pistol Creek was a key factor in the determination by the City to redevelop the area. The Bicentennial Park was built utilizing local funds and Federal Community Development Block Grant funds. Bicentennial Park was dedicated on July 4, 1976.
The development of Bicentennial Park changed the complexion and character of the entire area. The initial walkways became the nexus of the Maryville Alcoa Greenway and the park itself became known locally as the Greenbelt. 
Between the period 1976 and 2007, the area surrounding Bicentennial Park began to grow and rejuvenate, with residential, commercial and public service development occurring at a slow but steady pace. 
Not long after completion, Canada Geese stopped at Bicentennial Park on migration, and a small flock has remained at Bicentennial Park since that time.
In 1996, the City Maryville celebrated its 200th Anniversary with the dedication of two monuments in the Bicentennial Park (Greenbelt).
In 1999, the first phase of the Maryville Alcoa Greenway was completed which included all of the former walkways in Bicentennial Park.
In 2002, the Blount County Library was opened, bordering Bicentennial Park.
In 2007, a bridge was built across Bicentennial Park from downtown Maryville to the Blount County Library.

Big Brother Germany (season 8)

Season Eight of Big Brother Germany lasted exactly half a year from 7 January 2008 to 7 July 2008 and was shown on RTL II.
Season summary.
As the other seasons of Big Brother Germany, the eighth season was broadcast on RTL 2, where in a daily show the previous day's events were summarized. In a weekly live show, hosted by Charlotte Karlinder, Miriam Pielhau and Jürgen Milski, nominations and evictions were held. Usually the housemates nominated each other with the viewers voting for eviction of a nominee (by phone). Additionally, the 24-hour live TV channel was brought back and was again offered by Premiere for 15 € a month.
For the first time since Big Brother The Battle the house was divided into two areas: rich and poor. The rich area, holding 6 housemates, was luxurious with comfortable furniture, a wide range of food and beverages, sufficient cigarette supplies and alcoholic drinks (beer, wine, champagne). The poor area, also inhabited by 6 housemates, on the other hand was equipped like a canteen kitchen. The food supplies were rather poor with limited cigarette supplies and usually no alcoholic beverages. Both areas were separated by a small wall, which wasn't allowed to be crossed and over which no "smuggling" was allowed. A spiral staircase, used by both teams, lead to the upper floor which held the bedrooms. While the rich area's bedroom had luxurious double beds, the poor team's bedroom contained an operating-table-like structure, on which the housemates slept in sleeping bags.
From time to time (usually during the weekly live show) there were matches in which both teams competed against each other, resulting in the winning team changing into or continuing to live in the rich area. In additional matches teams could compete for rewards (e.g. a large plate with burgers and fries, being able to play Wii in a separated room, etc.).
The winner was Silke "Isi" Kaufmann who won 250,000 €. The season's theme song was "Choose to be me" by Sunrise Avenue
Housemates.
Entered on Day 1:
Intruders:
Nominations Table.
Notes:
<br> As new Housemates Anki and Nadine were Immune - they could Nominate but not be Nominated. The Housemates were voting for who they wanted to Evict and the two Housemates with the most votes were fake Evicted. They returned to the House the following day.
<br> The Public Voted for which team (the Rich Team or the Poor Team) they wanted to be immune from Nomination. They chose the Poor Team and hence Alex, Anki, Isi, Marcel and Melly are safe from Nomination this Week. When voting the Public can vote to save a Housemate, or to Evict a Housemate. The Evictee is decided by the Housemate who has, of their total, the highest percentage of Evict votes. For example this week, of all the votes cast to save/evict her 90.8% of Bianca's votes were to Evict her. Whereas only 47.0% of Rebecca's votes were to Evict her. Therefore, with the higher percentage of evict votes, Bianca was Evicted.
<br> This Week the Public were allowed to Nominate for 2 points. They chose Nadine to Nominate, although this had no effect. As new Housemates Dirk and Neila were Immune.
<br> Caro, as a new Housemate, was Immune this Week. The Public also selected Rebecca to be Immune. Had she not been chosen for Immmunity, Rebecca would have faced the Public Vote this Week.
<br> This Week Housemates (apart from Jenny who, as a new Housemate, is Immune) grouped together into pairs of Alex & Caro, Hassan & Nadine, Isi & Rebecca, Kevin & Marcel and Melly & Patrick. They Nominated individually, but each individual Nomination for them also counted as a Nomination for their partner. After Nominations Isi & Rebecca and Melly & Patrick both had the most Nominations with 4 each and, with 79.1% of the Vote, Melly and Patrick were chosen to face the Public Vote this Week.
<br> Marcel S. and Serafino were Immune as new Housemates. Nadine was also chosen by the Public to be Immune - if she had not been Immune she would have faced the Public Vote.
<br> This Week it was the Housemate with the MOST Nominations who would get to choose the three Nominees. Tanja was Immune as a new Housemate, and Serafino was also chosen for Immunity by the Public. Alex received the most Nomination Points with 5 and was hence immune and in charge of choosing the three Nominees. He selected Hassan, Isi and Marcel S.
<br> Mandy was immune as a new Housemate and Isi won immunity in a public vote. This week, the Housemates made 2 Nominations, the first Nomination was for an "Old Housemate" (shown in the top of the Nomination Box) and the second Nomination was for a "New Housemate". A New Housemates is considered as any that entered on or after Day 64 (Franco, Mandy, Nora, Serafino, Steffi and Tanja). Serafino received the most votes for the new Housemates and faced the Public Vote. Out of the old Housemates Isi received the most votes, but had already been chosen for Immunity. Alex and Hassan were next, and the Public chose Alex to face the Public Vote alongside Serafino.
<br> This week the one Housemate with the most nominations would be up for eviction. That Housemate then has to choose another two Housemates (one old and one new) to be also up for eviction. As both Nora and Tanja received the most nominations with 4 each, the public decided which should be the first nominee and chose Nora, who then selected Isi and Tanja to join her as Nominees.
<br> This Week it was the Housemate's mothers who Nominated on the Housemate's behalf. Steffi's mother declined to take part and therefore forfeited Steffi's Nomination. Marcel was Immune after being chosen by the Public.
<br> The Public chose Marcel to be Immune this Week.
<br> All female Housemates were immune this Week. The Public decided that Marcel should automatically face the Public Vote as punishment for rule breaking and Marcel was hence automatically Nominated alongside the two Nominees.
<br> In the final round of Nominations Housemates were allowed to Nominate themselves. Isi was awarded immunity by the Public.
<br> From now on all Housemates will automatically face the Public Vote to win.

Webster Kitchell

Rev. Dr. Webster Lardner Kitchell (May 21, 1931 – February 9, 2009) was a Unitarian Universalist theologian and author. He was minister emeritus of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Santa Fe in New Mexico.
Education and ministerial career.
Kitchell graduated from Amherst College and served as a corporal in the United States Marine Corps during the Korean War. Following his discharge, he graduated from Harvard Divinity School in June 1957, and in October of that year he was ordained as an associate minister at the Unitarian Church of All Souls in New York City. Kitchell was the first associate minister at that church since 1941.
In June 1960, Kitchell attracted attention when he delivered a sermon that argued the national purpose of the U.S. was defined by its role within the international community. "We must have a new ideal to dedicate ourselves to," he told his congregation. "We must fasten our ideals upon the vision of a world community, if not as a political fact, at least a world community in cooperation and spirit." In the same sermon, Kitchell challenged comments made by evangelical leader Billy Graham that the only way to reform the United States was to reform its population, referring to that assertion as "a myth."
Later in 1960, Kitchell left New York to become the first minister for the newly formed Eliot Unitarian Chapel in Kirkwood, Missouri. In 1973, he was named minister for the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Houston, Texas. In 1980, Kitchell became the first ordained minister for the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Santa Fe, which had operated with a lay fellowship since its founding in 1952.
In 2000, Kitchell became minister emeritus at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Santa Fe when Stephen Furrer was named minister for the congregation.
Literary career.
Kitchell is the author of three books: "God's Dog: Conversations with Coyote" (1991), "Coyote Says: More Conversations With God's Dog" (1996) and "Get a God: More Conversations with Coyote" (2002) All three books, which were published by the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, provide dialogues relating to concepts of faith, philosophy, existentialism and life’s truths as seen through a Unitarian Universalist spectrum. The Coyote character is inspired by American Indian theology. "For Coyote and me, faith means that we have to live our lives as if the cosmos, the planet, life, our fellow creatures, and ourselves are sacred," says Kitchell in "Get a God: More Conversations with Coyote." "That is the myth Coyote and I have returned to."

Rayko Zhinzifov

Rayko Ivanov (Yoanov) Zhinzifov (; 15 February 1839—15 February 1877), born Ksenofont Dzindzifi (Ксенофонт Дзиндзифи) was a Bulgarian National Revival poet and translator from Veles in today's Republic of Macedonia, who spent most of his life in the Russian Empire.
Biography.
Zhinsifov was born in 1839 in Veles in the Ottoman Empire, today in the Republic of Macedonia in Graecophile Aromanian family. He initially studied Greek in Prilep at his father's school. In 1856, he was already an assistant teacher in Prilep at Dimitar Miladinov's school and a teacher in Kukush (modern Kilkis, Greece) afterwards.
In 1857–1858, Zhinzifov immigrated to Russia with the aid of Miladinov and enrolled at the Chersonesos high school in Odessa (modern Ukraine). Towards the end of 1858 he moved to Moscow, where he graduated from the Faculty of History and Philology at the Moscow University in 1864. Under strong influence of the Bulgarian national revival ideas as a student he changed his name from his Greek birth name Ksenofont ("Xenophontos") to the Bulgarian Rayko, advised by Georgi Rakovski; thought, his teacher Miladinov had called him Rayko at school.
In 1863 he had issued his book "New Bulgarian Collection" including own and translated poems. Zhinzifov lived among the young Bulgarian diaspora in Moscow, along with Lyuben Karavelov, Nesho Bonchev, Konstantin Miladinov, Vasil Popovich, etc., and issued the "Brotherly Labour" magazine. In the Russian press of the time, Zhinzifov was particularly active in the information of the Russian society about the tough fate of the Bulgarian people under Ottoman rule. He co-operated with the Bulgarian newspapers "Danubian Dawn", "Macedonia", "Liberty", "Bulgarian Bee", "Age" and "Time", the magazines "Chitalishte", "Periodical Magazine", "Bulgarian Booklets", etc., publishing articles, poems, Bulgarian folk songs and a single tale. His poetical heritage has led to him been described as a Romantic poet. Among his notable translations was the first Bulgarian translation of Old East Slavic text "The Tale of Igor's Campaign". He died in 1877, on his 38th birthday, in Moscow, roughly a year before the liberation of Bulgaria.
In his works, Zhinzifov emphasized the Bulgarian consciousness of the Slavic population of his native Macedonia. In his eyes, "Macedonian" was merely a geographic and ethnographic area of the Bulgarian lands as opposed to a separate ethnic or national term (cf. "Guslyar v sobor", "Karvava koshulya").
Honour.
Rayko Nunatak on Graham Land in Antarctica is named after Rayko Zhinzifov.

National Alliance for Hispanic Health

National Alliance for Hispanic Health (NAHH) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to improve the health and well being of American Hispanics by providing health care information, emphasizing cultural competence and culturally proficient programs. It has been named one of the best nonprofit organizations to work for.
NAHH conducts research, demonstration programs and provides information services through its member organizations, which include community-based groups, universities, government agencies, foundations and corporations. According to PBS's "Remaking American Medicine" series, it is the oldest and largest network of Hispanic health and human services providers, delivering services to more than 14 million people each year.
NAHH is governed by a vounteer board of directors and managed by its president and chief executive officer, Dr. Jane L. Delgado, who has served in that capacity since 1985. Dr. Delgado is the author of The Latina Guide to Health (Newmarket Press, 2010).
History.
NAHH, also referred to as the Alliance, was founded in 1973 as the Coalition of Spanish Speaking Mental Health Organizations (COSSMHO) and has also been known as the National Coalition for Hispanic Health and Human Services Organizations.
In 1987, NAHH was one of several Hispanic and Latino groups which persuaded the federal government to improve its health data research for Hispanic populations in the United States. The initiative was prompted in part by publication of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' report on "Black and Minority Health" which had found more complete health and demographic data on American Indians and Asian Americans than Hispanics. Delgado, on the coordinating committee of the Task Force that prepared the DHHS report, related to the "Washington Post", "Data collection drives national policy in this country, and we don't have good data on Hispanics."
The organization's research work has included the Hispanic Health Research Consortium whose work on the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) was published as the first collected mainstream health journal issue to focus on Hispanic health, research on Hispanic youth demographics which reported that Hispanics for the first time were the nation’s largest racial/ethnic group of children, and publication of findings from the first survey of Hispanic communities and emergency preparedness issues.
Among its policy efforts, NAHH played a leading role in the landmark Disadvantaged Minority Health Improvement Act of 1990, has been active in protection of patient rights under Executive Order 13166 to improve health access for limited English proficient (LEP) persons, lead health information technology policy efforts, has been active in regulatory oversight of the Medicare Modernization Act, is an advocate for expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, is a vocal advocate on tobacco control policy in Hispanic communities, and advocates for clean air and water in Hispanic communities. In 2007, NAHH partnered with Research!America to field the first national public opinion survey of Hispanics on health and research issues. Most recently, as a compliment to its online action network, the organization established the Vote for Your Health effort that delivers election day text message reminders to vote to members.
The 1998 Surgeon General Report on Tobacco Use recognized the Alliance for having "refused the support of the tobacco industry" and alcohol industry and "adopted a formal policy not to accept money from tobacco companies or their subsidiaries."
In April 2010, the NAHH was named to The NonProfit Times' "Best NonProfit Organizations to Work for in 2010".
Programs.
NAHH serves Hispanic communities nationwide through its member frontline health providers and organizations. Its areas of health research and information services include diabetes, heart health, high blood pressure, mental health, fitness, physical activity, healthy eating, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, environmental health and health insurance, among others. 
NAHH focuses on four program goals: building a base of knowledge, increasing public awareness, sponsoring collaborative networks and strengthening community infrastructure for Mexican American, Puerto Ricans, Cuban American, Central American and Latin American populations. 
Among its key programs are bilingual health resources hotlines, co-sponsored with the Centers for Disease Control. In 1999 the NAHH published "The State of Hispanic Girls", publishing research showing that "greater acculturation among Hispanic girls is tied to poorer health and educational outcomes."
NAHH sponsors the Health Environment Action Network (HEAN), equipping volunteers with Eco-Pacs to monitor pollution levels in Hispanic majority areas. Eco-Pacs consist of video cameras, GPS locators and detectors measuring for pollutants including nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and particle mass (a measurement of how many particles are in the air). The project seeks to determine the level of pollution in urban areas, involving mostly young people in New York City, Detroit, central California and southern Texas.
Among its national programs are hotlines offering free and confidential health information in Spanish and English, including a Medicare Part D hotline.
The Alliance/Merck Ciencia Hispanic Scholars Program is a major five-year $4 million scholarship effort established in 2008 by the Alliance and the Merck Company Foundation. For students in three cities, the Alliance will award 50 scholarships for up to $42,500 each for students pursuing science, technology, engineering and math (STEM fields) college degrees. An additional 125 Hispanic college students in STEM degrees nationwide will earn $2,000 scholarships.
NAHH partners with Health Foundation for America's Vote For Your Health program and with Univision to broadcast half-hour specials related to the Alliance's national family physical fitness program. "Entérate…¡Vive Tu Vida!", also in cooperation with the United States Tennis Association.

Adrian Roks

Adrian Roks is a Canadian former business owner serving a life sentence in Kingston Penitentiary in connection with the Christmas Eve 2001 Woodbine Building Supply, Co. fire, which killed Tony Jarcevic and severely injured Sam Paskalis. Prior to his arrest, Roks owned two tanning salons with his wife. Roks was charged and convicted under article 229(c) of the Criminal Code from statements made by three of the co-accused, Regaldo, McMaster, and Paskalis.
Fire.
Woodbine Building Supply was destroyed on Christmas Eve in 2001, in what was one of the biggest fires in Toronto's history. More than 170 firefighters were required to bring the six-alarm blaze under control. Tony Jarcevic was killed in the blaze while Sam Paskalis was severely burned and disfigured, remaining in a coma for several months.
Investigators quickly concluded arson to be the cause of the fire, suggesting that Paskalis and Jarcevic were caught in the conflagration due to their inexperience, when they prematurely ignited gasoline and other flammable substances.
Trial.
Roks was identified as a co-conspirator due of his relationship with all three of the other suspects, some of whom frequented the tanning salons he owned. John Magno, the president of Woodbine Building Supply at Danforth Avenue and Woodbine Avenue, testified that he had no knowledge of Roks' involvement. Paskalis had previously been convicted of fraud and was out on bail during the Woodbine explosion. John “Sam” Paskalis had also allegedly burned down his own cottage, prior to the Woodbine fire, for insurances purposes. Adrian Roks maintains his innocence and is appealing his conviction.
Until his conviction on June 11, 2007, Roks was under strict bail conditions. Roks was never found to have breached his bail conditions and worked steadily at both his tanning salon locations.

Since the era of Mayor Francis Mott and later under Mayor John Davie's administration from 1915–1931, various redevelopment plans have been proposed for the district. Davie was fond of the lake, and took to rowing there daily for recreation. Davie attempted to fulfill his original dream of a "Civic Center" at the south end of Lake Merritt. Dredging material was used to fill, and make usable for the project, nearly a of swampy land from 1st to 7th Streets and from Fallon Street to 5th Avenue. A new museum building was planned, along with an athletic center, an exhibition hall, an opera house, a symphony hall and other facilities.
Before the end of WWII, Oakland's City Manager at the time, Charles R. Schwanenberger, began raising hopes for renewed development in the district. Revised plans called for a new main public library, a central fire station, police administration building, and a new jail in the area. The long-delayed widening of the 12th Street dam, at the time a traffic bottleneck for motorists, destroyed the Gardens of the Oakland Auditorium, and dashed hopes for a Civic Center at that site. Following the war, a planning document for "Civic Center and Lake Merritt Improvement" was adopted as a part of the city's Master Plan. This plan called for more than a dozen public buildings to be grouped between Harrison and Fallon and between 14th and 10th Streets in a rectangle, continuing past the Oakland Auditorium and the School Administration Building on East 10th Street in a curve around the south end of Lake Merritt.
A moratorium on new construction was imposed on the entire area pending development of the Civic Center, much to the chagrin of property owners.
Today parts of the plan have been realized on solid land on the west side of the lake, to include government office buildings, a courthouse, post office library, community college campus, and museum grounds.
Residences.
The district features the historic Hotel Oakland, now a senior residence, at its west end, and the 1920s Peralta Apartments on Jackson Street. The district also features 2–4 story mixed-use buildings at its southwest corner with apartments above ground-floor retail spaces.
Public Buildings.
The district is heavily sprinkled with government buildings to include Oakland's historic Civic Center Post Office on the city block bounded by Alice, Jackson, 13th and 12th Streets, the federal Social Security Administration Building on Jackson Street, two Alameda County government office buildings, the Alameda County Law Library, Oakland's Main Library on 14th Street, The Alameda County Courthouse on Lake Merritt, Oakland's historic Fire Alarm Building on Oak Street, the Oakland Museum on 12th Street, and the Kaiser Convention Center anchoring the east end of the neighborhood near the 12th Street Dam.
A new use for the Kaiser Convention Center was proposed in 2006: a redevelopment designed to nucleate a cultural and educational district with the neighboring Oakland Museum of California and Laney College. In July 2006, the Oakland City Council approved a bond measure to expand the city's library system and convert the closed Center into a replacement for the city's aging main library, but Oakland voters defeated the library bond measure in the November 2006 election.
'Infill' parcels.
The district is also heavily sprinkled with 'infill' parcels which have a variety of daily commercial use. Most are used as parking for the districts drive-in workforce, and nighttime bar and nightclub patrons. One is used as a preschool playground. One parcel at the Southeast corner of 12th and Jackson, which was formerly the site of a retail building, has been leveled, and the dirt lot is being reclaimed by nature as a Greenfield.
Land Development Activity.
In recent years, mid-rise, mixed-use condominium buildings have been planned and constructed on the edges of the district. Several high-rise mixed-use projects ranging from 10-40 stories in height, have been proposed by a variety of developers. Some are still active in various stages of the planning process.
2001 Civic Center Cathedral Proposal.
In 2001, the Oakland Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church proposed a replacement for the St. Francis de Sales Cathedral, which was damaged in the 1989 earthquake and subsequently demolished. The diocese hired a Swiss architect who designed a grand cathedral featuring curving steel beams coming to a point some fifteen stories high. The diocese proposed situating the cathedral directly in front of the Kaiser Convention Center and surrounding it with a "grand plaza." The plaza would have been elevated, so that both the parking lot and adjacent roads would still have been usable, and it would have extended all the way to the edge of the lake.
Coalition of Advocates for Lake Merritt (CALM), an Oakland group proposed an alternative plan involving a remake of the 12th Street Dam halving the number of traffic lanes from six to three in each direction. The underpasses and overpasses were proposed to be eliminated, with stoplights installed where the road intersects with 12th Street and 1st Avenue. The beach was proposed to be widened, with a gently sloping lawn leading up to the roadway, new walking and bike paths in each direction. Crosswalks with pedestrian-activated stoplights were proposed to replace the tunnels under the freeway.

<doc id="19350147" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19350147" title="Cristallo (mountain)">
Cristallo (mountain)

Cristallo is a mountain group in the Italian Dolomites, northeast of Cortina d'Ampezzo, in the province of Belluno, Veneto, northern Italy. It is a long, indented ridge with four summits higher than 3,000 metres.
Peaks.
The highest peaks of the Cristallo group are "Monte Cristallo" (3,221 m), "Piz Popena" (3,153 m), "Cima di Mezzo" (3,154 m), and "Cristallino d'Ampezzo" (3,008 m). Cima di Mezzo and Cristallino d'Ampezzo can be reached by via ferratas, while Monte Cristallo and Piz Popena both require climbing skills.
Geology.
Cristallo is largely formed from the Upper Triassic dolomitic rock Dolomia principale. The mountain was formed during Cretaceous, as well as the rest of the Dolomites, due to the collision between the African and European continents.
Tourism.
Access.
A cable lift system starts from "Rio Gere" in "Val Begontina", first a lift to "Rifugio Son Forca" at the upper end of Val Padeon. The gondola lift up to "Forcella Staunies" (2919 m), close to "Rifugio G. Lorenzi" (2.932 m), was built for the Winter Olympics in Cortina in 1956.
Through the eastern part of the massif goes the Dolomite Highway number 3.
Via ferratas.
The two via ferratas "VF Ivano Dibona" and "VF Marino Bianchi" both start from the top of the cable car at Forcella Staunies. "VF Marino Bianchi" can be followed to the peak Cima di Mezzo.
"VF Ivano Dibona" follows the Zurlon-ridge. It is a historical route used in World War I, and later restored and made safe for tourists. At the beginning is the longest via ferrata suspension bridge in the Dolomites, the 27 metre long "Ponte Cristallo".
The via ferrata "VF Renato de Pol" can be used for access from the western side of the Cristallo massif.
Winter sports.
Cristallo is one of the major skiing areas in the surroundings of Cortina.
Cabins (rifugi) and restaurants.
Some of the cabins and restaurants available are the "Rifugio Son Forca" at 2,235 m; "Capanna Guido Lorenzi" at 3,003 m (Auronzo di Cadore); "Ristorante Rio Gere" at 1,680 m; "Ristorante Lago Scin" at 1,336 m; "Ristorante Staulin" at 1,370 m; "Ristorante Son Zuogo" at 1,800 m.
History.
During the World War I there was considerable military activity in the mountain. The front lines between Italian and Austrian troops went through the mountains. Remains of ladders and barracks are still found today, and transport lines (ferratas) have been restored.
Popular culture.
In 1993 the film Cliffhanger was shot on and around the bridge on the Zurlon-ridge, as well as some of the other peaks in the area.

Cadmean victory

A Cadmean victory () is a reference to a victory involving one's own ruin, from Cadmus (Greek: "Kadmos"), the legendary founder of Thebes in Boeotia and the mythic bringer of the alphabet to Greece. On seeking to establish the city, Cadmus required water from a spring guarded by a water-dragon similar to the Lernaean Hydra. He sent his companions to slay the dragon, but they all perished. Although Cadmus eventually proved victorious, the victory cost the lives of those who were to benefit from the new settlement.
The phrase "Cadmean victory" has been largely displaced in popular use by "Pyrrhic victory", which carries a similar connotation.

Daron Joffe

Daron Joffe (born 1975) is a U.S. agribusiness and nonprofit executive who is prominent in the organic farming and biodynamic agriculture movements. He is the founder and president of Farmer D Organics and the nonprofit Gan Chaim community-supported farming project.
Education and early career.
Joffe was born in South Africa and moved with his family to Atlanta, Georgia, when he was three years old. When he was a student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, he took an accredited apprenticeship on a nearby organic farm. Joffe dropped out of school in 1995 and returned to Georgia, where took an apprenticeship at a biodynamic farm. In 1996, he returned to Wisconsin and bought a farm, where he combined organic and biodynamic agricultural practices. In 1998, he was honored by the American Biodynamic Association as the organization’s “rookie biodynamic farmer of the year.” Joffe would later recall that the farm was not profitable, and that he made more money selling organic pizza and falafel at a farmers’ market in Madison, Wisconsin.
In 2000, Joffe relocated to San Francisco, California, where he worked as a teacher with the San Francisco League of Urban Gardeners (SLUG). The program, which was based at the Log Cabin Ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains and was run by the San Francisco Juvenile Probation Department, taught horticulture and farming to incarcerated teenagers.
Joffe, in an interview with the "San Francisco Chronicle", praised the SLUG concept of bringing urban youth to a farm setting. "Gardening is a powerful teaching tool because food is so elemental and they get that," he said. "Out here, these kids grow food that they contribute to their communities back home. That's a life-changing experience for many of them."
Nonprofit and corporate farming endeavors.
Joffe returned to Georgia in 2002. In January 2003, he received a $60,000 grant from the philanthropic Joshua Venture to establish Gan Chaim (Hebrew for "Garden of Life"), which sought to bring involve the state's Jewish community in organic and biodynamic solutions to a farm in Athens, Georgia. Joffe compared the concept of Gan Chaim to an Israeli kibbutz, with its sense of community support and self-reliance.
Later in 2003, Joffe created Farmer D Organics, an agribusiness consulting company. The company expanded into producing a line of organic compost that is sold in U.S. natural products retail stores.
Joffe expanded his public profile through his work as vice-president of Georgia Organics, a nonprofit organization that promotes the state's organically grown foods, and through weekly video features presented on the Mother Nature Network environmental Web site. He has also developed organic farms for the University of Georgia and for low-income communities within the state. In 2005, he began operations for a organic farm at Hampton Island, a private community in Riceboro, Georgia.

Latécoère 14

__NOTOC__
The Latécoère 14 was a French airliner built in 1923, but only to the extent of a single example. It was a conventional, high-wing cantilever monoplane with a wing of very thick section. An enclosed cabin was provided for four passengers, while the pilot sat in an open cockpit above the wing. This arrangement was disliked by its pilots as they feared being crushed if the aircraft were to roll over on takeoff or landing.
Trialled by Lignes Aériennes Latécoère in comparison to the Breguet 14 and its performance was found to be wanting, with a top speed of roughly half that of the Breguet machine already in service. Development was abandoned at this point, although the wing design was re-used for the Latécoère 16, and even the model number was reused for an unrelated design that was to form the basis of the Latécoère 17.

Amsterdam Lelylaan railway station

Amsterdam Lelylaan is a railway station in west Amsterdam. It is served by trains of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen and metros of the GVB. The station opened on 1 June 1986. It is located on the Amsterdam-Schiphol railway, a few km south of Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station. South of this station, trains turn west towards Schiphol railway station, while metros turn east towards Amsterdam Zuid railway station. The station is located in the Amsterdam borough of Slotervaart, on a long viaduct spanning three roads.
History.
Construction.
The station was built in 1986 when a link was constructed from Amsterdam Centraal to Schiphol Airport. The new line reduced journey time from Centraal Station and Schiphol to as little as 16 minutes. The other stations built on this line were Amsterdam Sloterdijk (rebuilt) and Amsterdam De Vlugtlaan. De Vlugtlaan was closed in May 2000 to enable construction of the Hemboog.
Nederlandse Spoorwegen.
For its first 10 years, Intercity trains called at Lelylaan station, providing direct services to places as far away as Brussels, Berlin and Leeuwarden. From 1996 to 2006, only stopping trains called at this station. In 2006 an intercity service Schiphol-Amsterdam Centraal-Lelystad was introduced, which also calles at Lelylaan.
GVB.
The metro platform is an island platform, which has a direct link onto GVB tram lines 1 and 17. The main entrance is further south. In the early 2000s the stairs to the tram lines were closed off with fences to counter fare evasion, which was running high, with people running off the train and straight onto a tram. Early 2007 the gates were opened again, but only during daytime.
Until 1988 the only tram here had been the 1, but in that year the 17 was extended from Surinameplein to Osdorp. The two lines follow different routes into the city centre. In 1997 GVB opened its fourth metro line, the 50 (Isolatorweg - Gein).
The station is also served by a small bus station.
Train services.
Since 1986, train services calling at this station have changed a lot. Since the end of 2003, there is a direct connection to Zaandam and Hoorn. The following services currently call at Amsterdam Lelylaan:
Tram services.
The current tram situation has its origin in December 2001. The first tram in this area was in 1954, when line 1 ran to Slotermeer. It was extended in 1962. In 1988 line 17 was extended to Osdorp as well, after it used to terminate at Surinameplein 1 km east of Lelylaan. Line 1 terminated at Dijkgraafplein and line 17 terminated at the Osdorpplein, near Meer en Vaart. In 2001 the current service pattern came into operation.
Bus services.
These services are operated by GVB.
This service is operated by Connexxion as part of the Schiphol Sternet network serving Amsterdam's Airport.

Barbara Brennan

Barbara Ann Brennan (born 19 February 1939) is an American author, physicist, spiritual healer, businesswoman and teacher working in the field of energy healing. In 2011, she was listed by the Watkins Review as the 94th most spiritually influential person in the world.
Education and early career.
Brennan received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics in 1962 from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and two years later received her Masters in Atmospheric Physics from the same institution. She then worked as an atmospheric physicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. From 1970, she participated in courses at a number of uncredited institutions, offering courses in the "human energy field". She completed a two–year program in Therapeutic Counselling at the Community of the Whole Person in Washington, D.C., followed by a three-year program in Core Energetics at the Institute for Core Energetics in New York, New York in 1978 and a five-year program in Spiritual Healership at the Phoenicia Pathwork Center in Phoenicia, New York in 1979. She was strongly influenced by Eva and John Pierrakos, who founded a system for self-transformation called the Pathwork, drawing on the ideas of Wilhelm Reich and Alexander Lowen. Brennan worked with the Pierrakos, and became a Pathwork Helper and Core Energetics therapist. Brennan also took seminars with and was influenced by Rev. Rosalyn L. Bruyere. She developed her own private healing practice in 1977 and then established a training programme to teach others. Brennan has Ph.D.s in philosophy from Greenwich University in Australia and theology from Holos University, both earned in 2001. These universities are unaccredited.
Ideas and theories.
Her first book, "Hands of Light: A Guide to Healing Through the Human Energy Field", is considered a "classic" in the field of spiritual healing, with reputedly over one million copies in print in 22 languages. Brennan claims to receive intuitive information about her clients during sessions, and to see repetitive patterns in the energy fields of her clients indicating common roots underlying their difficulties. Brennan's books contain drawings of auras and energy fields, and descriptions of how human energy fields interact with each other. She has popularized a seven-layer model of the energy field, each layer being structured of differing frequencies and kinds of energy and performing different functions. Brennan views the chakras as transformers that receive and process universal energy, as well as enabling expression and healthy functioning of the individual's own consciousness and psycho-physical make-up. She is best known for taking a methodical approach to energy healing.
Brennan has created a type of energy healing techniques that she calls "full spectrum healing" to work on the seven layers of the human energy field or auras. Brennan claims that the technique she calls "spiritual surgery" works on the fifth level of the human energy field using the power of a "spirit surgeon".
Brennan's concept of "hara".
In her second book, "Light Emerging", Brennan added, to her model of human subtle energies, the dimension of "intentionality" called "hara" . Hara holds the human body in material manifestation until the "life purpose" is fulfilled. When the hara is healthy, the individual acts naturally and effortlessly to fulfill his life purpose. The hara is the foundation for the human energy field (HEF), or aura. Because of this relationship, healing hara is considered especially powerful for healing the auric field and, thereby, the physical body.
Barbara Brennan School of Healing.
In 1982, she closed her private practice in New York City and established the "Barbara Brennan School of Healing", designed to train professional healers. The school is now located in Florida, and is licensed by the State of Florida Commission for Independent Education. In 2003, Brennan opened the "Barbara Brennan School of Healing Europe", originally in Mondsee, Austria which then moved to Bad Neuenahr near Bonn, Germany in 2006 and moved back to Austria to the small town of Bad Ischl in 2008. In 2007, a new branch opened in Tokyo, Japan. The Barbara Brennan School of Healing is a nonaccredited school.

Operation Dexterity

Operation Dexterity was a military operation, part of Operation Cartwheel in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) for the Allies in the Pacific theater of World War II. The operation was directed by the Supreme Allied Commander in the SWPA, General Douglas MacArthur and included amphibious landings at Arawe on 15 December 1943, and Cape Gloucester on 26 December 1943 in the northwest of New Britain, the capture of the Imperial Japanese held Tuluvu aerodrome on the 30 December 1943 and the amphibious landing at Saidor on 2 January 1944. The operation ended on 10 February 1944.
History and planning.
The Empire of Japan had largely achieved its objectives in the Pacific region in the spring of 1942, with almost the entire area between Burma and the Bismarck Archipelago under Japanese control. Further Japanese offensives against the Allied lines were planned to force them into a single decisive battle and then request negotiations for their surrender. The initial Japanese offensive failed during the Battle of Midway in June 1942 and subsequently the Japanese attempt to also capture Port Moresby in New Guinea collapsed, ending the Japanese offensive run in the Pacific theater of operations for the rest of the war. The allies in the South Pacific began their first counter-offensive against the Japanese-held island Guadalcanal in August 1942 and the Japanese forces were forced onto the defensive.
To keep the Japanese cowed and begin the Allied advance towards the Japanese home islands, the Allied military leadership envisaged an advance through the Pacific over two main lines of attack. Admiral Chester W. Nimitz would lead Allied forces in the Pacific and General Douglas MacArthur would advance Allied operations against the Japanese in the Southwest Pacific. Landings along the coast of New Guinea were planned which constituted the first step towards a return to the Philippines and the conquest of the Gilbert Islands. The operation in New Guinea was known as Operation Cartwheel which began on 30 June 1943 with the objective to conquer New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago and Rabaul. Until mid-September 1943, the fighting focused on the eastern part of New Guinea, while a decision was made on 22 September 1943 to land in West New Britain.
Operation Dexterity was to be conducted in three separate phases:
Geography and Environment.
Like most of the islands of the South Pacific, the Islands of the Bismarck Archipelago are of volcanic origin with steep mountain slopes, jungle and treacherous marshes, where malaria was a problem for all deployed troops. The hot, tropical climate was rarely ameliorated by the torrential rain storms and dense clouds which afflicted the region. The inhabited islands had been managed by Australia as a League of Nations Mandate before the war, and there was only a settlement of Westerners originally settled by Imperial Germany before the First World War that was centered on coconut plantations and missionary complexes.
The Japanese on New Britain.
The high command of the 8th Area Army of the Japanese Imperial Army in Rabaul controlled the Japanese actions in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea and the Bismarck Islands. In January 1942, the Japanese had taken the strategically important port of Rabaul in northeastern New Britain and in subsequent months the largest and most important Japanese naval and air base in the Pacific was constructed at that location. The 8th Area Army was commanded by General Hitoshi Imamura who had at his disposal nearly 200,000 men. In early 1943, the Japanese leadership had expected that the Allies would attempt to break the inner Japanese defensive belt in the Pacific and attack the bases on New Guinea, the Mariana Islands, Palau and the Philippines. General Imamura therefore foresaw an attack on New Britain, at the latest after the Allies had occupied New Ireland, which was expected in February or March 1944.
The 8th Area Army relied exclusively on barge and submarine traffic from Rabaul to New Guinea, because of Allied air superiority. In September 1943, Major General Iwao Matsuda took over the 65th Brigade, the various pioneers and debarkation units, and a number of troops of the 51st Division, whose main units were on New Guinea in the fight against Australian troops. Two companies of 115th Division and provisional infantry companies formed from artillery and engineer elements of the 66th Division, and about half of the 51st Reconnaissance Regiment belonged to General Matsuda's command. General Matsuda, a highly-experienced officer, established his headquarters near the airfield of Cape Gloucester. On 5 October 1943, all of Matsuda's units came under the command of the 17th Division which was commanded by Lieutenant General Yasushi Sakai, who had arrived in December 1943 from the Japanese theater of operations in China.
General Sakai set up his headquarters at Malalia in the vicinity of Cape Hoskins on the East Williaumez Peninsula. The 17th Division's troops began immediately ordering the expansions of the defensive lines. The Japanese headquarters was established in an existing concrete bunker at the foot of Talawe Mountain, which was surrounded by dense, tropical vegetation. Smaller bunkers and shelters for machine gun positions were sited at possible Allied landing beaches five miles southeast of Cape Gloucester. Two hills known later as "Target-Hill" and "Hill 660" served as focal points for the Japanese defenses. Thus about half of all available Japanese troops in the west of the island were in positions that could effectively contribute to the defense of Cape Gloucester.
On 12 December 1943, General Yasushi Sakai advised all commanders of his units about an imminent Allied invasion. The large volumes of Allied landing ships along the ports of New Guinea did not convince the Japanese of the scheduled operations of Allied forces. False invasion alarms were commonplace up to the end of 1943. With the Allies' air superiority increasing, the bombing of Rabaul and Wewak brought the realization that the invasion of New Britain was imminent.
Preparatory actions.
Reconnaissance.
Two days after the decision to proceed with the operation was taken by the Allied commanders, the US 6th Army's Alamo Scouts began to deploy in the area of Cape Gloucester. They neared the coast by torpedo boat, then transferred to dinghies and landed on the beaches. From there they reconnoitered the Japanese defenses by direct observations or through contact with the local aboriginal population of New Britain.

McCann Rescue Chamber

The McCann Submarine Rescue Chamber is a device for rescuing submariners from a submarine that is unable to surface. 
History.
During the first two decades of the United States Navy Submarine Force, there were several accidents in which Navy submarines sank with the loss of life. The impetus for the invention for the chamber was the loss of "S-51" on 25 September 1925, and the loss of "S-4" on 17 December 1927. In the case of "S-4", all of her officers and men were able to reach non-flooded compartments as the submarine bottomed in of water. However, the majority soon succumbed. In her forward torpedo room, six men remained alive. Heroic efforts were made to rescue these six, who had exchanged a series of signals with divers by tapping on the hull. In extremely cold water and tangled wreckage, Navy divers worked to rescue them, but a storm forced a stop to this effort on 24 December. Forty men lost their lives.
These experiences led submariner Charles B. "Swede" Momsen to think of technical alternatives for rescuing survivors from sunken submarines, which at that time was still a virtual impossibility. Momsen soon conceived a submarine rescue chamber that could be lowered from the surface to mate with a submarine's escape hatch and proposed the concept through official channels. While in command of the submarine "S-1" (SS-105), in 1926, Momsen wrote the Bureau of Construction and Repair (BuC&R) recommending the adoption of a diving bell for the purposes of rescuing entrapped personnel from submarines. But this idea was pigeonholed by the bureaucracy, even during his own subsequent assignment at BuC&R. The loss of "S-4" with all hands put the Navy was very much "on the spot" because of the loss of lives that might have been saved. The pressure of this incident forced favorable action and Momsen, using the aircraft hangar from "S-1", designed and built a prototype submarine rescue chamber.
During the first three months of 1928, divers and other salvage personnel were able to raise "S-4" and tow her to the Boston Navy Yard, where she was drydocked and repaired. She returned to active duty in October 1928 and was employed thereafter as a submarine rescue and salvage test ship. Momsen went to sea in the reconditioned "S-4" to carry out practical experiments and training with the rescue chambers. 
Work with "S-4" helped to develop equipment and techniques that bore fruit a decade later, when 33 men were brought up alive from the sunken submarine "Squalus". The first diving bells for rescuing men from submarines were designed by the BuC&R in 1928. The diving bell went through a series of tests off the shores of Key West, Florida. Based on these tests, Momsen had several changes in mind for the bell, and after nearly two years of experimentation full of highly interesting results, the final bell was evolved and christened a "rescue chamber." This success was catalyst for gaining approval for development of the submarine rescue chamber in 1930. Before he could make these changes, Momsen went to the Bureau of Construction and Repair to work on an underwater breathing apparatus for individual escapes. Momsen turned to devising the "Momsen Lung", demonstrating it successfully in a series of unauthorized experiments in the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers, and finally attracted enough favorable attention to see the lung adopted by the Navy in 1929.
Lieutenant Commander Allan Rockwell McCann was put in charge of the revisions on the diving bell. From July 1929 to July 1931, McCann was assigned to the Maintenance Division, Bureau of Construction and Repair, where he developed the submarine rescue chamber. When the bell was completed in late 1930, it was produced as the McCann Submarine Rescue Chamber (SRC)(Navy designated the first 12 of these as 1-12, YRC-4 was lost aboard the USS Pigeon, at Bataan, Philippines during the first days of WWII. YRC-5 was aboard the USS Widgeon (AM-22) during the Pearl Harbor attack.). In 1931 a one-fifth scale model of a diving bell for submarine rescue work was built and tested. Design called for the bell to withstand the external pressure encountered at a depth of at least of water, and the test showed the model fulfilled this requirement with a factor of safety of about 3.5. The vessel was tested under external pressure, failure occurring in the shell at a pressure of . Since the head of the vessel remained intact, it was decided to make a test of the head itself in order to determine its strength relative to that of the shell, and if possible to obtain some measure of the stresses occurring under load. The head collapsed at a pressure of , indicating its strength under external pressure was about 10% in excess of that of the shell.
The revised Submarine Rescue Chamber had improvements including a soft seal gasket for sealing the submarine/bell interface skirting, and a floor installed to maintain air-space in the bell during raising and lowering. Momsen in his speech to the Harvard Engineering Society on 6 October 1939 credits Allan Rockwell McCann with the improvements which made the bell operational, safe and large enough to hold up to eight rescued crewmen and two operators.
The "Squalus" rescue.
In 1939, the McCann Rescue Chamber made its debut when it was used to successfully rescue thirty-three survivors from "Squalus", At the time of "Squalus" accident, Lieutenant Commander Momsen was serving as head of the Experimental Diving Unit at the Washington Navy Yard. The submarine rescue ship USS "Falcon" (ASR-2), commanded by Lieutenant George A. Sharp, was on site within twenty-four hours. It lowered the Rescue Chamber — a revised version of a diving bell invented by Momsen — and, in four dives over the next 13 hours, recovered all 33 survivors in the first deep submarine rescue ever. McCann was in charge of Chamber operations, Momsen commanding the divers. Although there was no reason to believe anyone was alive in the aft part of the ship, a fifth dive was made to the aft torpedo room hatch on May 25. This run confirmed the flooding of the entire aft portion of the ship.
Design.
The rescue chamber was a pear shaped steel chamber, the big end uppermost, seven feet at the greatest diameter and ten feet high. It is divided into an upper closed compartment and a lower open compartment by a horizontal bulkhead which has a water tight hatch in its middle. Surrounding the lower compartment is a ballast tank of a capacity just equal to that of the lower compartment. Inside the lower compartment is a reel with of steel wire on it. The reel is operated by a shaft leading into the upper compartment. The shaft is rotated by an air motor. On the bottom edge of the lower compartment a rubber gasket is embedded into a circular groove, so that when the chamber is brought into contact with a flat surface (the hatch ring) a water tight joint may be effected with the application of pressure. Attached to the upper compartment is an air supply and an atmospheric exhaust hose, wire wound for strength. Also electric cables for telephone and light are attached. A wire pendant for hoisting and lowering is shackled into a pad-eye on top. This wire is also used for retrieving the chamber in case of emergency. The forward and after hatches of American submarines were fitted for attaching the rescue chamber. They have a flat doughnut shaped plate welded to the hatch combing upon which the bottom of the chamber rests and a bail over the center of the hatch to which the haul down wire must be attached by the diver.
Limitations.
The McCann bell suffers severe limitations in strong currents and when dealing with a pressurized submarine or one lying at extreme angles. It is also incapable of functioning below . The USN Submarine Rescue Chamber (YRC) is air transportable to a Vessel Of Opportunity (VOO) Mother Ship (MOSHIP) which requires little modification to use the system. Transfer Under Pressure (TUP) to and from pressurized environments such as submarines or hyperbaric chambers is not possible with this system, even though TUP is essential where being subjected to ambient pressure may be life threatening. Since the creation of the Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicles "Mystic" and "Avalon", the McCann Rescue Chamber is rarely used, but is part of the Submarine Rescue Chamber Flyaway System (SRCFS) which is capable of worldwide submarine rescue missions. Once launched, the SRCFS is able to operate around the clock.

Geyser Valley trail

The Geyser Valley trail in Olympic National Park is an area along the Elwha River between Rica Canyon and the Grand Canyon of the Elwha, where many homesteaders tried to eke out a living in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, this trail allows hikers to visit several interesting sites, as well as, providing several loops of different lengths.
The route begins at Whiskey Bend Trailhead, at the end of Whiskey Bend road, approximately 5 miles from the Elwha Ranger Station. It travels for about 1.3 miles along the Elwha River trail, before the first descent down approximately 400 feet to Goblins Gate at the head of Rica Canyon. The trail continues along the Elwha River through a riparian forest of bigleaf maple, red alder, black cottonwood, with Douglas fir, Western red cedar, and Grand fir.
The trail passes the alder grove of Krause Bottom, where the first possible loop back up the slope heads up, and some old homesteader clearings, before arriving at Humes Ranch Cabin, approximately 3 miles from the trailhead. Humes Ranch Cabin is maintained today by the National Park Service as a historic site, and the meadows below the cabin are kept open as Humes once did. You can also see 100-year old fruit trees in the pastures. Approximately 3/4 of a mile further, the trail climbs the eroding cliffs along the river and crosses Dodger point bridge at the mouth of the Grand Canyon of the Elwha. This marks the end of Geyser Valley, but the trail continues for 11 miles up to the summit of Dodger Point Mountain at over 5,700 ft.
It is possible to begin looping back to the Elwha river trail, by slowly climbing the slope. The trail will meet the short-cut coming up from Humes Ranch Cabin and then will pass the old homestead of Michael's Cabin. The trail then heads back on a level grade back towards Whiskey Bend trailhead.
Homesteaders historically reported seeing enormous numbers of salmon coming up the river each year to spawn. However, salmon have been blocked from the upper 65 miles of river habitat with the construction of the Elwha Dam in 1913. However, both the Elwha Dam and Glines Canyon Dam were removed in 2012. As part of the Elwha Ecosystem Restoration project, Chinook salmon began returning to the Geyser Valley.

Play Like a Champion Today

Play Like a Champion Today is a saying that both the University of Oklahoma Sooners and the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football programs have used over the years. Its origin before being used before the late 1940s is unknown.
Origin.
The exact origin of the term "Play Like a Champion Today" is unknown. Its first reported use was in the late 1940s under coach Bud Wilkinson, then the head coach of University of Oklahoma football team. Bud's son Jay Wilkinson states that the first sign was put up early in his father's OU coaching tenure, but he doesn't believe that his father invented the phrase and isn't sure where it came from.
University of Oklahoma.
The University of Oklahoma has used a sign with the phrase since the late 1940s, under coach Bud Wilkinson. Traditional during home games at Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium Oklahoma players and coaches touch the "Play Like a Champion Today" sign posted above the locker room doors as they head into the tunnel that leads to the field before every home game. For away games a travel version is posted by equipment staff for the players to touch as they depart the locker room for the field.
As the team enters the field, the Sooners run under a crimson banner that displays 'Play Like a Champion' that is flanked by flags representing each of Oklahoma's seven national championships.
University of Notre Dame.
The term has been used by Notre Dame since at least 1986 when Lou Holtz came across a photo in a Notre Dame book with the sign “Play Like A Champion Today.” After asking around and coming up with no one remembering the sign and what had happened to it, he had a new sign painted and placed in a stairwell between the home team locker room and the tunnel to the field of Notre Dame Stadium. This original sign was painted by Laurie Wenger in the fall of 1986.
It is a tradition by players to touch it on their way out of the locker room.

Partido Galeguista (1931)

The Partido Galeguista (Galicianist Party) was a Galician nationalist party founded in December 1931. It achieved notoriety during the time of the Spanish Second Republic. The PG grouped a number of historical Galician intellectuals, and was fundamental in the elaboration of the Galician Statute of Autonomy (1936).
Origins.
In December 1931 the "Partido Galeguista de Pontevedra" (Galicianist Party of Pontevedra), directed by Castelao and Alexandre Bóveda, called for a General Nationalist Assembly in order to create an all-Galician nationalist party. A total of 32 Galicianist organizations attended, including the "Irmandades da Fala" (Brotherhoods of the Language) and the "Partido Nazonalista Republicán de Ourense" (Republican Nationalist Party of Ourense), among others.
The PG was a plural party hosting different political tendencies, and where internal tensions were not uncommon. The PG initially embraced:
Political ideas.
The political programme of the PG revolved around the ideals established by the "Irmandades da Fala", that is, considering Galicia as a cultural unit entitled to political self-determination. In order to achieve this the minimum required was forming a Galician Parliament and a Galician Government. It also aimed at eliminating clientelism, supporting anti-imperialism and equal rights for the women. Furthermore, the PG claimed for the suppression of the provincial governments (perceived as a redundant administrative structure) and the establishment of the parish as an official territorial tier. Official status for the Galician language and agrarian reform were also in the agenda.
Independence was never a priority for the PG, as independentists were a minority within the party. It was thought that Galicia could operate within the framework of a Spanish federal republic. Yet, War and the impossibility to establish such a federal republic led to disappointment. In a later stage, around 1944, PG's president and intellectual leader, Castelao, began to consider the option of full independence.
Members of the PG expressed a strong pro-Europeanism, situating the party ahead of its time on this issue. They also supported the strengthening of the League of Nations (predecessor of the UN) as a tool to solve international conflicts. In 1933, the PG successfully requested the admission of Galicia into the League as a stateless nation. Those negotiations were conducted by Plácido Castro.[http://www.vieiros.com/nova/69052/setembro-de-1933-galiza-unha-nacion-en-europa][http://www.igadi.org/fundacion_placido_castro/placido_ramon_castro_del_rio_us.htm]
Consolidation.
In 1932 the PG works alongside the "Partido Republicano Gallego" (Galician Republican Party) and "Acción Republicana" (Republican Action) in the drafting and promotion of the Statute of Autonomy. The PG negotiates a number of pacts with local parties and in 1933 it takes part in the local elections, obtaining a single local deputy for Ourense. This issue opens the debate in the PG, as some wanted to seek alliances with republican parties (left-wing), something which was frontally rejected by the conservatives.
The conservative pressure within the party forces PG to take part at the 1933 general Spanish elections on its own. The 106,000 votes obtained are not enough to grant a seat at the Spanish Parliament. Furthermore, the new conservative Spanish government halts the development of the Statute of Autonomy, bans PG's newspaper "A Nosa Terra", and relocates Castelao and Bóveda far from Galicia (they were civil servants).
In its Third Assembly, January 1934, the PG eventually decides to ally with left-wing republican parties, with the opposition of Vicente Risco. This decision is ratified in the Fourth Assembly, April 1935, this time with the opposition of Otero Pedrayo. Thus, the conservative sector leaves the PG to found "Dereita Galeguista" (Galicianist Right-Wing). The PG then openly becomes a left-wing party.
"Frente Popular".
In June 1935 the PG initiates negotiations with "Izquierda Republicana" (Republican Left), and in January 1936 the PG decides to integrate itself in the "Frente Popular" (Popular Front). Hence, the PG presented five Galicianist candidates to the Spanish general election of 1936, namely: Castelao, Bóveda, Xerardo Álvarez Gallego, Ramón Suárez Picallo and Antón Villar Ponte.
In the province of Lugo the PG ran on its own, since specific pacts for that province could not be formalized, thus obtaining no representatives. However, out of the five candidates the PG obtains three seats in the Spanish Parliament. These are Castelao, Súarez Picallo and Vilar Ponte, with a combined total of some 287,000 votes. As a consequence, in June 1936 the Statute of Autonomy is put to the vote with the help of the "Frente Popular", and the "yes" wins with an overwhelming majority.
Civil War.
Following the revolt of general Francisco Franco in July 1936, and the start of the Spanish Civil War, normal political life comes to an end. Galicia soon falls under the control of the fascist Francoist troops and PG members are prosecuted. Some of them are captured and executed, such as Johán Carballeira, Ánxel Casal, Manuel Lustres Rivas, Camilo Díaz Baliño, Víctor Casas or one of the main leaders of the party, Alexandre Bóveda. Others are forced into exile, like the president of the party, Castelao, who was in Madrid when the war started and managed to flee.
In 1937 the PG establishes a delegation in Barcelona, still a republican area, and publishes the magazine "Nova Galicia" between April 1937 and July 1938. Castelao and Suárez Picallo call for the unity of all democratic forces in Spain to preserve the Republic, while maintaining the Galicianist ideals. In 1938, after the fall of Barcelona, the Galicianists in the area move to France and from there to South America.
The underground.
As soon as the Civil War ended in 1939, Galicianists tried to get in touch again in order to rebuild the party in Galicia. The PG appeared in the underground in July 1943, when 19 members meet in Coruxo and decide to form a temporary executive committee, including Manuel Gómez Román, Otero Pedrayo and Plácido Castro. Yet, in this new period, Francisco Fernández del Riego and Ramón Piñeiro had the most active role.
One of the priorities was to establish contacts with the rest of the Galician opposition to the Francoist regime, and also with Basque and Catalan nationalists. In 1944 the PG forms together with the Spanish Socialist Party, CNT, UGT, and other trade unions, the "Junta Gallega de Alianza Democrática" (Galician Union for the Democratic Alliance).
Ramón Piñeiro was detained in 1946. Fermín Penzol took responsibility for keeping contact with the other organizations. With the release of Piñeiro in 1949, and in the light that the underground activity did not produce any palpable results, the PG led by Piñeiro decides to prioritise the defence of Galician culture, gradually abandoning the political activity. This was severely criticised by the Galicianists in exile. Hence, the foundation of the "Galaxia" publishing house in 1950 marks the self-dissolution of the PG in Galicia. From that date militants in Galicia take part in the new cultural strategy, which revolved around "Galaxia".
The PG in the Americas.
In 1932 a branch of the PG was created in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This was the "Organizacion Nazionalista Repubricana Galega" (Galician Republican Nationalist Organization). It had 150 members and was led by Rodolfo Prada. At the time of the Civil War it changes its name to "Grupo Galeguista de Bos Aires" (Galicianist Group of Buenos Aires). In 1941 it takes the name of "Irmandade Galega" (Galician Brotherhood). In 1942, with the massive arrival or Galician expatriates to Buenos Aires (including Castelao), this same group relaunches the PG newspaper "A Nosa Terra". In 1944, "Irmandade Galega", with the support of Castelao, establish the "Consello de Galiza", a sort of Galician government in exile.
There was also a branch of the PG in Uruguay, named "Irmandade Galeguista do Uruguai", led my Manuel Meilán. In 1949 the PG only had a total of some 200 active militants scattered around Buenos Aires and other Argentinian cities, Montevideo (Uruguay), Mexico and Havana (Cuba). With the cessation of the political activities of the PG in Galicia, the PG abroad quickly faded out, especially after the death of Castelao, the historical leader of the party, in 1950.

The Nic Diederichs Technical High School slashing was an incident on 17 August 2008 at the Nic Diederichs Technical High School in Krugersdorp, South Africa, in which 18-year-old matric (Grade 12) student Morné Harmse attacked four people with a samurai sword. 16-year-old grade 9 pupil Jacques Pretorius was killed, and two campus gardeners and a second pupil were seriously injured. Harmse later pleaded guilty to a charge of murder and three charges of attempted murder and was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment.
Harmse was reported to have "followed" the practice of satanism. The attack also lead to blaming and criticism of the American heavy metal band Slipknot, as Harmse had acquired a mask that resembled one of a Slipknot band member's, and had donned on a dress similar to the band's drummer, Joey Jordison, during the morning of the attack, and had also started listening to the band months prior to the attack.
The attack.
At about 7:00 a.m. (SAST), Harmse arrived at school in his school uniform, wearing a brown mask and with black paint on his face. The mask was reported to be an imitation of the one Slipknot lead vocalist Corey Taylor wears, which Harmse had referred to as the "maggot mask" but the media claimed that it resembled Joey Jordison's own mask and not Taylor's. Two other masks were found in Harmse's bag; one clown mask from a Hollywood costume store similar to Shawn Crahan's, and the other, a handmade papier-mâché with holes drilled in and painted with tribal marks. Three samurai swords were also found in his bag, which included a Sekizo Ninja sword and a small Katana.
At about 7:20 a.m., during an assembly for a congregation, Harmse took out his 60-cm samurai sword, and slashed 16-year-old pupil Jacques Pretorius' neck, causing him to die immediately. Harmse then walked down a passage and slashed 17-year-old Stefan Bouwer on the head, and was then immediately confronted by two school groundskeepers, Joseph Kodiseng and Simon Manamela, who were both slashed and injured. All three were taken to hospital.
Harmse's attack was concluded when he sat down on a brick wall and stuck the sword in the ground, which was grabbed by his younger brother, Corné, who was standing nearby. At about 7:45 a.m., Harmse was escorted to the principal's office, and fifteen minutes later, was arrested by police without incident. He was temporarily held in the custody of the Krugersdorp Police Station.
Conviction.
On 20 August 2008, Harmse was charged with one count of murder and three counts of attempted murder at the Krugersdorp Magistrate's Court. He was later sent to the Sterkfontein Psychiatric Hospital for mental health evaluation. On 25 October, after two consecutive months of mental health evaluation and two postponements of the court date, Harmse was ruled to be mentally fit by Magistrate Joachim Nortje.
The case was transferred to the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg for trial in front of Judge Gerhardus Hattingh. On 14 April 2009 Harmse pleaded guilty to all four charges, and on 10 October he was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment.
Reactions.
Blame on Satanism and media.
In the aftermath of the attacks, blame was put on Satanism, which Harmse took an interest in. Harmse claimed that Satan had told him to do it, and that he followed the practice of Satanism. When police executed a search in Harmse's room, they found "disturbing elements of Satanism" that included ouija boards and "spell books."
Heavy metal act Slipknot was also blamed for the attacks as Harmse obtained masks resembling those of the band members, and was reportedly listening to the band months before. This resulted in media attention and criticism of the band, who initially responded with "no comment".
Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor later issued a response to Harmse's actions:
Apology.
The parents of Morné Harmse, Machiel and Liza Harmse, issued a formal apology to the Pretorius family.

Latécoère 15

__NOTOC__
The Latécoère 15 was a French airliner built in 1925 for use on Latécoère's own airline on routes between France and Morocco. It was a parasol-wing monoplane of conventional design, with twin engines mounted among the wing bracing struts, and small stub wings fitted to the lower fuselage as a mounting point for these struts and for the main undercarriage units. Six passengers could be carried in an enclosed cabin, and the pilot sat in an open cockpit in the nose. 
The design was soon found to be seriously underpowered, unable to take off with the maximum load intended by the design, and unable to stay aloft on only one engine. Therefore, while Pierre-Georges Latécoère had intended for the aircraft to be used to extend the line's existing route to Casablanca over the desert to Dakar, the pilot assigned to fly it, Didier Daurat, flatly refused to do so. In the end, Daurat's view prevailed, and the ten Latécoère 15s were used on the Oran-Casablanca route and short feeder routes into Casablanca before being withdrawn from service between 1926 and 1929. 
One of the aircraft was fitted with pontoons and trialled on a route between Alicante and Oran as the Latécoère 15H, but this was not deemed successful, and the aircraft was converted back.
The third prototype was built as a bomber, with a modified fuselage but otherwise unchanged. It was known as the Latécoère 19. It had a fixed Vickers machine gun in the nose, an open dorsal turret with a Lewis machine gun and another Lewis gun mounted to fire down through a ventral port. There were bomb racks in the place of the passenger cabin, as well as ventral hooks for other ordnance.

Chanhassen High School

Chanhassen High School (CNS) is a public high school located in Chanhassen, Minnesota, a southwestern suburb of the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area. CNS is a 9th–12th-grade school. Construction of the school was approved by voters in 2006 in response to rapidly growing enrollment in Carver County and overcrowding at Chaska High School, the district's other high school.
History.
As a result of steady population increases in Carver County, Chaska High School's enrollment surpassed its building's designed capacity, with future growth in the school district "expected". As a result, voters approved a referendum in 2006 to provide funding for a new high school. The vote was very close, a matter of 2% of the population. Opponents of the bond referendum claimed the school district did not provide support that it looked into other ideas for the district beyond building a new high school and the district did not take into consideration other options they may have had (using buildings in other ways).
Athletics.
Chanhassen's athletic teams competed in the Lake Conference of the Minnesota State High School League for their first year as a school. They joined the Missota Conference in 2010–2011. 
Music.
Chanhassen has three concert bands including Concert Band, Varsity Band, and Symphonic Winds. Chanhassen has a string orchestra directed by Paul Swanson. Chanhassen has a marching band that has participated in the Chanhassen Homecoming Parade and Steamboat Days Parade annually since the establishment of the school. Along with that, Chanhassen has two jazz bands, and a pit orchestra. Paul Swanson directs all of these ensembles.
Along with multiple bands, Chanhassen High School also has seven choirs all directed Sarah Gilbertson. These choirs include Concert Choir, Bel Canto, Vivace, the 9th Grade Women's Chorale, Men's Choral, Chamber Singers, and Vox. It also has one choir known as "Men Who Sing", directed by Chad Shultis.
Alternative Learning Program.
Chanhassen High School used to house Chaska High School's Alternative Learning Program (ALP). The supervisor of this program was Pat Ames through the 2010–2011 school year; currently the supervisor is the principal of Chanhassen High. This program is designed to help students who are in need of a different learning environment find success. Students have smaller classes and additional support structures so that guided learning is more available to each individual.

Aaron Curry (American football)

Aaron Curry (born April 6, 1986) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League. He was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks fourth overall in the 2009 NFL Draft. He also played for the Oakland Raiders in 2011 and 2012. He played college football at Wake Forest.
Early years.
Curry attended E. E. Smith High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina. While there he played linebacker and tight end. He earned all-conference and all-region honors and was the conferences defensive player of the year as a senior after recording 123 tackles. He was also selected to the North Carolina–South Carolina Shrine Bowl as a tight end.
Considered only a two-star recruit by both "Rivals" and "Scout.com", Curry chose to play college football at Wake Forest over East Carolina, the only two scholarships he was offered. Curry said he chose Wake Forest in part because it was two hours from home, but mostly for revenge. "Anybody who passed me up, I was going to punish them. That's why I chose the ACC, those schools like Carolina, Duke, and North Carolina State were right around the corner, and I wasn't wanted by any of them."
College career.
As a freshman in 2005 he started 10 of 11 games and was the teams fifth leading tackler with 39. After his great season he was named second team Freshman All-American and ACC All-Freshman Team by the "Sporting News". As a sophomore in 2006 he started all 14 games at outside linebacker, finishing second on the team in tackles with 83. Curry's breakout season came as a junior in 2007. During the season he tied the NCAA record for the most interception returns for touchdown in a season by a linebacker with three. He also broke the school record with 226 interception return yards. He finished the season second on the team and 13th in the ACC in tackles with 99, and earned Second team All-ACC honors and second team All-America honors from CollegeSportsReport.com. Curry seriously considered entering the 2008 NFL Draft to provide for his family, but later chose to return.
In his senior season he had 105 tackles, including 16 for a loss, and was the winner of the Butkus Award. Curry was also selected an All-American by ESPN, "Pro Football Weekly", and "Sports Illustrated".
Curry graduated in 2009 with a bachelor's degree in sociology.
Professional career.
2009 NFL Draft.
Curry was widely believed to be the best linebacker available in the 2009 NFL Draft. Considered a "safe pick", he was even in the debate for the No. 1 pick overall—which would've made him the first linebacker selected first overall since Aundray Bruce in 1988. ESPN′s Mel Kiper, Jr. compared Curry to Keith Bulluck.
Curry was drafted fourth overall by the Seattle Seahawks in the 2009 NFL Draft. He was the highest drafted linebacker since LaVar Arrington went second overall in the 2000 NFL Draft to the Washington Redskins, and the highest Wake Forest Demon Deacon since Norm Snead went second overall to the Washington Redskins in the 1961 NFL Draft.
Seattle Seahawks.
On August 8, 2009, Curry signed a six-year, $60 million contract including $34 million guaranteed, the most money ever guaranteed to a non-quarterback rookie in NFL history.
Curry became the starting strongside linebacker for the Seahawks immediately. In his first career game against the St. Louis Rams he recorded four tackles. He recorded his first career sack against Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler in week 3.
In 2009, Curry recorded 61 tackles and 2 sacks, and in 2010, he compiled 73 tackles and 3.5 sacks. In 2011, he lost his starting position to rookie K. J. Wright after just two starts. Since he failed to meet the expectations of a high draft pick, Curry is widely considered to be a draft bust.
Oakland Raiders.
Curry was traded to the Oakland Raiders on October 12, 2011, in exchange for a seventh-round draft pick in 2012 and a conditional pick in 2013. On November 16, 2012, Curry was fined $23,625 for two offenses against the Baltimore Ravens.
On November 20, 2012, Curry was waived by the Oakland Raiders after spending all but two weeks of the 2012 season on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list.
New York Giants.
Curry signed a one-year deal with the New York Giants on May 10, 2013. On August 25, 2013, the Giants released Curry to trim down the 75 man roster. On August 28, 2013, Curry retired from the NFL.
Personal.
Curry is the son of former Detroit Lions and Baltimore Colts defensive back Reggie Pinkney; he has had a minimal relationship with his father.
His brother is former NFL linebacker Eric Barton.
He currently resides in North Carolina.

Rugby Quebec

Rugby Québec is the popular name of the Fédération de Rugby du Québec (formerly the Québec Rugby Union) which is the provincial governing body for the sport of rugby union in the Canadian province of Québec. The Fédération de Rugby du Québec is affiliated with the Canadian Rugby Union.
The Fédération de Rugby du Québec origins are hard to trace for two reasons. First, rugby union in Canada converged with and then later split from the game of Canadian football, often with rugby football unions representing both games, thus making an exact history hard to establish. Second, the Fédération de Rugby du Québec has not put a great emphasis on maintaining detailed historical records. This has led to gaps in its administrative and competition history and the lost information may never be known.
The Westmount Rugby Club traces its roots back to 1876 or 1878, and some sort of organized rugby has been played in Québec ever since. In the 1920s and 1930s many clubs made the transition to professional or semi-professional football. Regardless, several leagues were formed during the 1950s that were not associated with the Québec Rugby Union. This changed in the later 1960s and in the late 1970s the union officially changed its name to the Fédération de Rugby du Québec.
The FRQ has many differing levels and types of competition. There are two predominate competitions that have the longest historical record. The first is the "Premier Championship Cup", which is awarded annually to the best rugby team in cup competition. This has also been known as the "Quebec Cup", "Senior Cup", the "First Division Cup", the "A Division Cup" and (formerly) the "Standard Life Cup" and can trace its origins back to the 1950s. The second oldest championship is the "Intermediate Cup", awarded to the best club team in the "second side" cup competition. This has also been known as the "Second Division Cup", the "B Division Cup" and the "Des O'Neill Trophy".
Original clubs.
As leagues in Montréal and the "St. Lawrence Rugger and Cricket Association" were formed, the first cohort of modern clubs was founded.
New clubs.
The union began to expand in the 1970s and 1980s, with its first wave of new clubs. Additionally, for a good part of the 1970s several Ottawa based rugby teams regularly completed in the QRU, including the Ottawa Indians, Ottawa Irish, Ottawa Beavers, Ottawa Scottish and the Deep River Blues. Of particular importance was the entry of the Club de rugby Parc olympique into the FRQ, as it was the first primarily francophone team in the federation.
Recent Clubs.
The FRQ experienced substantial growth in the past two decades, and has added many new clubs, especially because rugby now enjoys a much greater popularity in French language school boards.
Two teams, the "Chateauguay Hammerheads" and "Hudson Highlanders", played at the turn of the century, but have folded.

Likely, California

Likely (formerly, South Fork) is a census-designated place in Modoc County, California. It is located near the South Fork of the Pit River south of the county seat of Alturas, at an elevation of . Located north-northwest of Likely Mountain, it is somewhat sheltered from prevailing southwesterly winds, and its microclimate is noticeably drier and less stormy than surrounding areas. The ZIP Code for the community is 96116.
Geography.
Likely lies on the south side of the South Fork of the Pit River, in the south end of South Fork Valley, in the northeastern corner of California at . Fragments of the southern edge of the Modoc Plateau surround Likely on most sides.
History.
Likely now occupies what was originally an Achumawi (Pit River) village known as Hamawe or Hammawi. The town was initially known as South Fork, named after the South Fork of the Pit River, and was renamed at the insistence of the United States Post Office, which insisted at that time that Post Offices could only have one-word names. Residents were unable to agree what to name their town until a local rancher observed that they would most likely never agree upon a name, at which point someone nominated the name, "Likely", and the name was voted in. The South Fork post office operated from 1878 to 1882. The Likely post office opened in 1886.
One of the last of the American Indian Wars was fought at Infernal Caverns, a short distance from Likely.
A 1913 book described Likely as having a population of 75, and situated along the main automobile route from Madeline to Bayley.
The Likely Peat Moss Company, Radel Inc. operated in Likely until 1987 when the non-renewing supply of high quality hypnum peat moss in nearby Jess Valley was depleted. The peat moss was strip-mined from the floor of Jess Valley and trucked 13 miles to Likely on the winding canyon road paralleling South Fork Pit River between Likely and Ivy, California. The peat moss was processed and packaged and then shipped by both truck and by Southern Pacific Railroad until rail services to Likely were discontinued. The company, Radel, was dissolved in 1987 upon the owner's retirement.
Geography.

<doc id="19350663" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19350663" title="High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia">
High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia

In urologic pathology, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, abbreviated HGPIN, is an abnormality of prostatic glands and believed to precede the development of prostate adenocarcinoma (the most common form of prostate cancer). 
It may be referred to simply as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (abbreviated as PIN). It is considered to be a pre-malignancy, or carcinoma in situ, of the prostatic glands.
Signs and symptoms.
HGPIN in isolation is asymptomatic. It is typically discovered in prostate biopsies taken to rule-out prostate cancer and very frequently seen in prostates removed for prostate cancer.
Prognosis.
On a subsequent biopsy, given a history of a HGPIN diagnosis, the chance of finding prostatic adenocarcinoma is approximately 30%.
Diagnosis.
HGPIN is diagnosed from tissue by a pathologist, which may come from:
Blood tests for prostate specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination, ultrasound scanning of the prostate via the rectum, fine needle aspiration or medical imaging studies (such as magnetic resonance imaging) are "not" useful for diagnosing HGPIN.
Pathophysiology.
Histology.
HGPIN typically has one of four different histologic patterns:
Its cytologic features are that of prostatic adenocarcinoma:
Microscopically, PIN is a collection of irregular, atypical epithelial cells. The architecture of the glands and ducts remains normal. The epithelial cells proliferate and crowding results in a pseudo-multilayer appearance. They remain fully contained within a prostate acinus (the berry-shaped termination of a gland, where the secretion is produced) or duct. The latter can be demonstrated with special staining techniques (immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins) to identify the basal cells forming the supporting layer of the acinus. In prostate cancer, the abnormal cells spread beyond the boundaries of the acinus and form clusters without basal cells. In HGPIN, the basal cell layer is disrupted but present.
Because it is thought to be a premalignant state, PIN is often considered the prostate equivalent of what is called carcinoma in situ (localized cancer) in other organs. However, PIN differs from carcinoma in situ in that it may remain unchanged or even spontaneously regress.
Several architectural variants of PIN have been described, and many cases have multiple patterns. The main ones are tufting, micropapillary, cribriform, and flat. Although these different appearances may cause confusion with other conditions, they have not been found to be of clinical importance. Rarer types are signet-ring-cell, small-cell-neuroendocrine, mucinous, foamy, inverted, and with squamous differentiation.
Relation to prostate cancer.
There are several reasons why PIN is the most likely prostate cancer precursor. PIN is more common in men with prostate cancer. High grade PIN can be found in 85 to 100% of radical prostatectomy specimens, nearby or even in connection with prostate cancer. It tends to occur in the peripheral zone of the prostate. With age, it becomes increasingly multifocal, like prostate cancer. Molecular analysis has shown that high grade PIN and prostate cancer share many genetic abnormalities. This has been confirmed in a transgenic mouse model.
The risk for men with high grade PIN of being diagnosed with prostate cancer after repeat biopsy has decreased since the introduction of biopsies at more than six locations (traditional sextant biopsies).
Treatment.
HGPIN in isolation does not require treatment. In prostate biopsies it is not predictive of prostate cancer in one year if the prostate was well-sampled, i.e. if there were 8 or more cores. 
The exact timing of repeat biopsies remains an area of controversy, as the time required for, and probability of HGPIN transformations to prostate cancer are not well understood.
History.
PIN was historically subdivided into different stages, based on the level of cell atypia. PIN was formerly classified as PIN 1, 2 or 3, in order of increasing cell irregularities. Nowadays, PIN 1 is referred to as low grade PIN, and PIN 2 and PIN 3 are grouped together as high grade PIN. Only high grade PIN has been shown to be a risk factor for prostate cancer. Because low grade PIN has no significance and does not require repeat biopsies or treatment, it is not mentioned in pathology reports. As such, PIN has become synonymous with high grade PIN.

Tin City Air Force Station

Tin City Air Force Station (AAC ID: F-04, LRR ID: A-11) is a closed United States Air Force General Surveillance Radar station. It is located west-northwest of Nome, Alaska. 
The radar surveillance station was closed on 1 November 1983, and was re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) site as part of the Alaska Radar System. Today, it remains active as part of the Alaska NORAD Region under the jurisdiction of the 611th Air and Space Operations Center, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.
History.
Tin City AFS was a continental defence radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. It was one of the ten original radar surveillance sites constructed during the early 1950s to establish a permanent air defense system in Alaska. 
The station was located at the westernmost tip of the Seward Peninsula, also the most westerly point of land on the North American continent. Two small islands, the Little and Big Diomedes, are located in the Bering Straits 25 miles west of the station. Little Diomede Island is part of the United States, while Russia claims Big Diomede, making it the closest Russian territory to the United States. The Asian mainland of Siberia is 48 miles to the west of the station. On a clear day, both islands and the Siberian coastline are visible. The radars were located on the southern base Cope Mountain, at an elevation of 2,275 feet.
Construction of the station, first designated Cape Prince of Wales AFS (after the geographic location Cape Prince of Wales), began on 9 September 1950 and was completed in late 1952. The Army Transportation Corps undertook the project, code name Mona Lisa, of getting the initial supplies and equipment to the construction site. The only means of getting construction materials and supplies to the site was by barge or Navy LSTs, however this was restricted to when the sea was not frozen and had to be unloaded 3 miles from the proposed site. Initially, there were no roads, which had to be built as part of the construction effort. Each item had to be hauled along the beach to the area nearest the construction site, then inland to the permanent storage area.
The ground support station was located on a plateau, at an elevation of 270 feet, located in a small canyon between the airstrip and radar site . A 4,500' airstrip was constructed on a plateau east of the ground support station, with a gravel runway capable of C-130 landings. The station consisted of a power/heating plant, water and fuel storage tanks, gymnasium and other support office buildings. Two other buildings contained living quarters, work areas, and recreational facilities plus opportunities for such sports as skiing, skating, horseshoes, and basketball. The buildings were connected by enclosed portals so no one needed to go outside in winter unless absolutely necessary. Tours at the station were limited to one year because of the psychological strain and physical hardships. Mail was usually delivered twice a week. The inaccessibility made the personnel at the site responsible for maintenance if anything went wrong. Water mains occasionally froze and ruptured.
The radar site was connected to the base station by an 7,200' aerial tramway, the longest in North America. All large equipment was required to be dissembled then re-assembled at the top camp radar station. The tramway cables were constantly breaking because of high winds and ice, and fog and the extreme cold made repairs hazardous. Ice 16 inches thick built up on the cables in winter.
The 710th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W Sq}, activated on 8 December 1952, provided information 24/7 to the air defense Direction Center at Murphy Dome AFS near Fairbanks, where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. Radars operated at the station were AN/FPS-3, and an AN/FPS-20A. The station name was changed to Tin City Air Force Station on 1 September 1959.
Communications were initially provided by a high frequency radio system which proved unreliable because of atmospheric disturbances. The Alaskan Air Command, after investigating various options, decided to build the White Alice Communications System, a system of Air Force-owned tropospheric scatter and microwave radio relay sites operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The Tin City site was activated in 1957. It was inactivated in 1979, and replaced by an Alascom owned and operated satellite earth terminal as part of an Air Force plan to divest itself of the obsolete White Alice Communications System and transfer the responsibility to a commercial firm.
Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In 1983, Tin City AFS received a new AN/FPS-117 minimally attended radar under Alaskan Air Command's Seek Igloo program . It was designed to transmit aircraft tracking data via satellite to the Alaskan NORAD Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB. 
No longer needed, the 710th AC&W Sq was inactivated on 1 November 1983 and the station re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) Site. This left only contractor personnel to maintain the site radar. In 1990, jurisdiction of the Tin City LRR Site was transferred to Eleventh Air Force with the re-designation of AAC. 
In 1998 Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) initiated "Operation Clean Sweep", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation of the radar, support and White Alice communication station was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005.
Current status.
Today very little of the former Tin City Air Force Station remains. The site is controlled by the PACAF's 611th Air and Space Operations Center, based at Elmendorf AFB. The site is maintained by ARCTEC Alaska Inc. civilian contractors and they access the site by former support airstrip, now the Tin City LRRS Airport and provide maintenance and support when needed to maintain the radar system.
Tin City ops reported to Campion AFS (near Galena), not to Murphy Dome.

Big Brother Germany (season 7)

Season Seven of Big Brother Germany lasted for 148 days from 5 February 2007 to 7 July 2007 and was shown on RTL II.
Season summary.
After a disappointing sixth season, which was supposed to run forever but was cut short and a year break the producers decided to return with a "Back to the roots"-format for season seven with 12 housemates living together in one house and the only twist being that the housemates had to earn the prize. For every match a certain amount of money was put in the jackpot with the maximum being 250,000€ which only the winner would receive.
During the season the nomination rules were changed several times (see notes in the nominations table) for entertainment purposes and to protect controversial housemates. The most controversial of them was Eddy, who was disliked by a large number of viewers, but also had a strong fanbase. Within the house he had friends (e.g. Basti and Oliver) and "enemies" (e.g. Leon and Janine), with alliances changing over the season (he was friends with Kathrin and Michael at first, but fell out with them later). After being evicted by his fellow housemates Eddy returned as a guest in the final week and provoked some of the most controversial moments of the season (with his targets being Kathrin and Michael). These moments probably helped Michael to win the show, as he was considered a victim of Eddy's provocations. Additionally, Michael's strongest rival for the win, Sonja, had become Basti's girlfriend during the season and Basti was close with Eddy (Basti re-entered as a guest in the final week together with Eddy).
Despite not being a ratings hit, season 7 at least lived up to RTL II's low expectations and an 8th Season was greenlit right at the end of the show.

Ibrahim Ismail (politician)

Ibrahim Ismail, popularly known as ‘Ibra’, is a Maldivian politician and former member of the People’s Majlis and the Special Majlis.
Prior to his career in politics, he was also an administrator in the education sector. 
He has been appointed as the Advisor to the President of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed.
Education.
Ibra completed his secondary education at Majeediyya School and in the Science Education Centre in Malé before attending the University of Canberra in Australia where he completed his Bachelors Degree. He then went on to read for his Masters Degree in Education Administration at the University of Canberra for which Ibra received a commendation for his thesis.
While he was a postgraduate student in Canberra, Ibra presented a research paper at the Annual Conference of the Australian Council for Education Administration in which he presented a new theory on educational systems in small island states.
Government Service.
After completing his post-graduate studies, Ibra returned to Malé and started his career at the Ministry of Education as a Research Analyst.
Ibra’s first personal experience of the real lack of political freedom in the Maldives came about in 1996, at a meeting of government officials, when he stated that the Treasury should reduce the state budget for the Presidential Palace. Ibra was placed under arrest for 45 days. He was then transferred to the Department of Public Examinations as an Assistant Director.
Political career.
Ibra first came to public attention in 2004 during his campaign for a seat in the Special Majlis, the legislative assembly tasked with drafting the new constitution. In a letter he wrote to President Gayoom on 20 April 2004, well before the publication of the Government’s Reform Agenda in 9 June 2004, Ibra called for constitutional amendments and the introduction of a checks and balance system, to reduce the term of office for the President, to strengthen human rights, to strengthen accountability and transparency within the government and to put special emphasis on the separation of powers so that the Judiciary, the Executive and the Legislature may function independently in line with that of any other democratic society.
Private Work.
In parallel to his public career, Ibra ran a consultancy firm. 
He started a training center to provide vocational skills in commercial service-based sectors.
Election to Public Office.
In 2004, Ibra was elected to the Special Majlis for the Malé constituency. 
On 12 August 2004, the public gathered in the Republican Square in front of the Headquarters of the National Security Service to protest at the treatment by the Police of political activists. Ibra addressed the gathering. Security services arrested many members of the crowd. Ibra was arrested along with other reformists that day and spent 68 days in solitary confinement in Dhoonidhoo Prison, and numerous days under house arrest.
Whilst under house arrest, Ibra contested one of the two seats allocated to the Male’ constituency in the People’s Majlis (Parliament) and won.
Ibra & MDP.
The Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) was the first political party to be instigated in the Maldives in recent history and Ibra played a huge role in its foundation. He was one of the first 42 people to put their signatures to register the party and also functioned as a councilor for the party in Male’ long before political parties were legalized in 2005. Ibra was elected to the post of Party President during its first Extra-Ordinary Congress, but later resigned as Party President on November 2006.
Member of the People’s Majlis.
Since his election to the People’s Majlis, Ibra has introduced several bills:
Listed below are some proposals made by Ibra to the People’s Majlis

Formula 3000

Formula 3000 was a type of open wheel, single seater formula racing, occupying the tier immediately below Formula One and above Formula Three. It was named for the fact that the cars were powered by 3000 cc engines.
Formula 3000 championships.
FIA International Formula 3000 Championship.
The most prestigious F3000 series, International Formula 3000, was introduced by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) in 1985 to replace Formula Two, and was itself replaced by the GP2 Series in 2005. While the International series is usually synonymous with F3000, other series racing to F3000 specification have existed.
British Formula 3000/F2 Championship.
A small British Formula 3000 series ran for several years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, usually using year-old cars. Founded in 1989 as the British Formula 3000 Championship, the series was renamed the British Formula Two Championship in 1992, but grids diminished quickly and it was ended after the 1994 season. It was restarted in 1996 and cancelled once more the following year, after one race had been held with only three cars. Two other attempts at restarting F3000 racing in the UK failed.
Euro Formula 3000/Euroseries 3000.
An Italian series evolved into a second-level one, Euro Formula 3000 (now Euroseries 3000), running the previous generation of spec Lolas. An Italian national series started in 2005 with the arrival of the GP2 Series, but has now been merged with Euroseries 3000, running both B02/50 and B99/50 cars. As of 2010, it is renamed Auto GP, using old A1 Grand Prix cars and engines in place of F3000 regulations.
American Racing Series.
The American Racing Series, a predecessor of Indy Lights, ran with March F3000 chassis (called Wildcats) and Buick V6 engines, before turning to Lolas some years later.
Japanese F3000/Formula Nippon.
Japan persisted with Formula Two rules for a couple of years after the demise of F2 in Europe, but then adopted basically F3000 rules in 1987. Unlike European F3000, the Japanese Championship featured a lot of competition between tyre companies, and tended to feature highly paid drivers (both local and European) in cars tending to be more developed and tested than those in the European series. The Mugen engine dominated this series, and was also competitive in European F3000. Japanese F3000 was renamed Formula Nippon in 1996, and completely split off from European racing in 2009 with the new Swift chassis.
Formula Holden/Formula 4000.
In Australia Formula 4000 continued to use old F3000 chassis (predominantly Reynard) until 2006, as had its predecessors Formula Brabham and Formula Holden.

Oregon Civic Justice Center

The Oregon Civic Justice Center is a three-story former library building on the campus of Willamette University in downtown Salem, Oregon, United States. Built in 1912 as a Carnegie library for the city of Salem, the building now houses several programs of Willamette University College of Law. Prior to the law school's moving into the facility in 2008, the building was used by the adjacent Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) from 1971 to 2006.
Willamette purchased the old library in 2003 and later selected the College of Law as the program at the school to gain use of the building. The university began renovations in 2007 to restore part of the original layout and modernize the facility to accommodate the needs of modern education. After the brick-faced, Beaux Arts style structure was remodeled, community oriented programs from the law school relocated to the renamed Oregon Civic Justice Center. This center houses programs such as a legal clinic and the school's law review journal.
History.
On October 12, 1901, the Salem Woman's Club was organized with the wife of Oregon Governor Theodore Thurston Geer serving as president of the organization. Two years later the group started the Salem Public Library at Geer's home, and then later located at Chemeketa and High streets in downtown Salem in the then city hall, with the library's collection totaling 50 books at that time. The library group hired a librarian, Miss F. Phillips, for a salary of $20 per month to run the library. In 1907, the group explored options to build a stand-alone library building using funds provided by Andrew Carnegie, who was providing funds for building libraries around the world.
In May 1909, the Woman’s Club purchased an option to buy the property on the southwest corner of Winter and State streets for $5500, which was located across State from Willson Park (a city park at that time). This group then raised the funds to purchase the land for $12,000, and Salem applied for a grant from the Carnegie foundation. The city was allotted $14,000 by the foundation to build a library, but the Women’s Club which owned the existing library and land had not been involved in the process. The organization was able to get the money rescinded, and in November 1910, worked with the city to increase their maintenance fund for the library. Carnegie then raised the grant to $27,500 at the lobbying of Lulu Bush (daughter-in-law to Asahel Bush) and the Woman’s Club deeded the lot and the other library assets to the city of Salem.
On September 12, 1912, the new library opened on the property near Willamette University and the Oregon State Capitol, though construction on the structure was not completed, and much of the furniture had not been installed in the building. The completed structure included hardwood floors, crown molding, windows that were two-stories tall, and a fireplace. The library cost $30,000 to build, and within a year of operating had expanded to serve nearly 7,700 patrons with a collection of nearly 10,500 books. On January 4, 1920, a small fire damaged the furnace room and about 50 books at the library.
In 1914, the YWCA of Salem was organized by the same Salem Women's Club. Located in downtown on Cottage Street Northeast, the YWCA moved in 1954 to the lot adjoining the library. By the 1960s, the small library had a collection in excess of 100,000 volumes, but needed a larger facility. A public campaign to build a new library began in 1968, with the library to be part of a larger government center that included a city hall and fire station. In 1971, the YWCA purchased the adjacent Carnegie library building for $150,000, and on July 6, 1972, the Salem Public Library vacated the Carnegie building and moved to Salem’s new Civic Center located west of the old library. Located next to the YWCA's existing home, the old library was turned into the organization's youth center. The building was remodeled from 1990 to 1991.
Legal center.
In 2003, Willamette University purchased the old building from the YWCA. The $1.35 million purchase included the main YWCA building adjacent to the former library for a total of , with the YWCA continuing their operations in the building for three years after the sale. After that group left the building in 2006, Willamette spent $4.6 million ($2 million more than originally planned) to remodel the old library building over a year's time and convert it into the Oregon Civic Justice Center as part of the College of Law. The remodeling project began in the summer of 2007 and included removing a swimming pool structure that had been added to the south of the building, while also adding a new entrance to the former library on the same side as where the pool was located. Renovations also removed a mezzanine that the YWCA had added to the upper portion of the main floor. Other renovations included new heating, cooling, and ventilation systems, upgrades for technology, all while retaining the historical look and feel of the original 1912 building.
On September 12, 2008, the building was re-dedicated exactly 96 years after the original dedication in a ceremony featuring sitting Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The ceremony was part of the College of Law's 125th anniversary festivities and featured Oregon dignitaries such as Oregon Supreme Court Chief Justice and Willamette alum Paul De Muniz. Willamette President M. Lee Pelton, who also attended the ceremony, selected the law school as the new tenants after other departments and programs at the school submitted proposals for the use of the old library.
Amenities.
The Beaux Arts style brick structure includes a portico on the State Street entrance on the north side. The façade includes an inscription, "PUBLIC LIBRARY", in Roman type over the entryway, which is sheltered by a rigid metal awning on this north front. The roof of the square-shaped structure is constructed of both metal and tile. Stone is used for architectural accents of lintels and cornices on the exterior. The building remains connected to the neighboring former offices of the YWCA, which is a Pietro Belluschi designed building also owned by Willamette University.
Inside, the main room is a conference room on the main floor that includes a large projection system that can be used for remote feeds, such as from the state capitol across the street. A painting by John Fery is displayed over the fireplace, which the fireplace was part of the original structure in the conference room. The remainder of the interior of the building has a modern look with glass-enclosed offices surrounding an open common area. Artwork owned by the university's Hallie Ford Museum of Art is displayed in this area. The main floor of the three-story building is the second floor, which rests atop the look-out basement. A small meeting room is located above a small portion of the main floor.
Programs.
The center is utilized to connect the College of Law and Willamette as a whole to the larger Salem community. In this capacity, the center houses several law school programs with community outreach aspects. These include the Oregon Law Commission, the Center for Democracy, the Center for Religion and Law, the Center for Dispute Resolution, Willamette's Clinical Law Program, the Center for Law and Government, and the school's law journal, the "Willamette Law Review". Each of these programs were chosen to be housed in the center due to having community outreach programs, with the goal of the center being to create a community atmosphere between students, faculty, and the community at large.

Washington Boulevard (Pasadena)

Washington Boulevard Is a major street in Pasadena, California, and one of eight streets in Pasadena named after U.S. States. It is notable for being a major roadway that bypasses Pasadena's central districts.
History.
Washington Boulevard was constructed in the early 20th Century to facilitate vehicular access to the Hotel La Pintoresca, originally the Painter Hotel, at the Fair Oaks intersection, and to service riders on the East Washington Streetcar line. The line ran for 2.5 miles between Los Robles Avenue and Santa Anita Avenue. Washington Boulevard originally terminated at Arroyo Boulevard and Altadena Drive. An extension west to Linda Vista was built in the 1940s and another southeast to Pasadena High School in the 1960s.
Geography.
West Washington.
At its westernmost end, Washington Boulevard serves as a utilitarian connection between Linda Vista and the neighborhoods east of the Arroyo Seco (the nearest crossings are 3100 feet to the north and over a mile to the south). The Washington Boulevard Bridge is a low bridge which crosses the river at one of its narrowest and flattest points, cutting through the Brookside Golf Course. It ascends the canyon wall by way of a single, quarter-mile long incline, which ends at Arroyo Boulevard.
Central Washington.
Between Los Robles Avenue and Hill Avenue, the road is mostly residential, the only commercial and industrial zones being located at intersections with major north-south thoroughfares.
East Washington.
"see also East Washington Village, Pasadena, California."
East of Hill Avenue, Washington Boulevard takes on a very different look. The road widens (originally to accommodate the streetcar line) and is lined with businesses, shopping centers, and postwar homes. This neighborhood has experienced major revitalization in the past decade as evidenced by several new retail buildings and new brick crosswalks.
East of Altadena Drive, the road bends southward and becomes isolated, with some 1980s-era housing developments on one side and the Eaton Wash on the other. Washington Boulevard officially ends on Sierra Madre Boulevard in front of Pasadena High School, though the roadway continues southward as Sunnyslope Avenue.
Trivia.
In Pasadena, five streets are named after U.S. Presidents and eight are named after states. Washington Boulevard is named after the state because of its east-west orientation (all streets named for presidents are north-south).

Libyan detainees at Guantanamo Bay

The United States Department of Defense acknowledges holding Libyan detainees in Guantanamo. A total of 778 detainees have been held in extrajudicial detention in the Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba since the camps opened on January 11, 2002. The camp population peaked in 2004 at approximately 660. Hundreds of detainees were released without charges.
Following the United States Supreme Court's ruling in "Rasul v. Bush" (2004) that detainees had the right under habeas corpus to challenge their detention before an impartial tribunal, transfers to Guantanamo decreased. 
Nineteen "high value detainees" have been transferred by the CIA to Guantanamo since September 2006, as the administration restricted their access to outside counsel and courts under the Military Commissions Act of 2006. This provision of the act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in "Boumediene v. Bush" (2008), which said detainees had the right of access to federal courts for "habeas corpus" challenges. As of February 24, 2010, the camp population stood at 188.
On February 24, 2010, Albania accepted the transfer of three former detainees, a Libyan, an Egyptian, and a Tunisian.

List of Camper Van Beethoven band members

The following is a complete chronology of the various line-ups of alternative rock music group Camper Van Beethoven. Camper Van Beethoven (originally called "Camper Van Beethoven and the Border Patrol,") formed in 1983 in Redlands, California, before relocating to Santa Cruz, California in 1984 and San Francisco, California in 1988. Prior to Camper Van Beethoven, band members David Lowery, Chris Molla, Victor Krummenacher and Bill McDonald played in several similarly conceived groups, with names like the Estonian Gauchos and Sitting Duck, that performed songs later found in the Camper Van Beethoven repertoire. Other members of these groups included Johnny Hickman and Eric Laing.
Camper Van Beethoven were inactive between late 1990 and 1999. Since reforming at this time, their lineup has been loosely defined, with several members acting as occasional or part-time collaborators, although the lineup has solidified around the five constant members in recent years.

List of recurring characters in The Suite Life on Deck

The following is a list of recurring, minor characters, in the Disney Channel Original Series, "The Suite Life on Deck". This article also includes Marcus Little, who was a main character in season 2 of the series.
Main characters.
Marcus Little.
Marcus Little first appears in the episode "Roomies". A former rapping sensation called Lil' Little, he comes aboard the SS "Tipton" to attend Seven Seas High School and is assigned as Zack Martin's roommate. Marcus lived in Atlanta, Georgia as mentioned on his sash in "The Beauty and the Fleeced" and unfortunately lost his fame and career after his voice deepened.
Marcus has a crush on London Tipton, and is shown to be quite gullible, often believing Woody Fink's tall tales. Like London, he also has many famous contacts, but he is sensitive about the loss of his fame because he believes that his celebrity friends won't like him. However, he is later proven wrong by Jordin Sparks in the episode "Crossing Jordin".
In "Breakup in Paris", Marcus gets a surprise by a boy named Dante who is posing as him at a CD signing. Marcus and Dante argue over who's the real Lil' Little, but the crowd believes Dante because of a nearby lifesize cut-out. Later Marcus and Dante both sing at a Lil' Little concert. Mr. Moseby recognizes Marcus as the real Lil' Little and gets recognized himself, ending up with the crowd beating him with a bicycle, as pointed out by London afterwards. Marcus tells Dante they should work together someday. Later in "My, Oh Maya", Dante comes back pointing out he is a stowaway that got on the boat with a rope.
In the Season 3 episode "Das Boots", it is revealed that Marcus has extremely poor gameplay towards chess (despite winning a match after Cody opts to help Zack who is trapped in a submarine with minutes of air left) and that his grandfather only talks about the bus schedule. Marcus makes his final appearance in "Bon Voyage". At the end of this episode, he leaves the ship after he discovers that he will make a rap opera inspired by his one-hit song. In a fashion similar to Green Day's rock opera American Idiot (musical) based on their album American Idiot, which he says was the inspiration for why he wanted to do it. Marcus quotes that he and his family will move to New York City so that Marcus can perform in his Broadway musical "Retainer Baby".
Supporting characters.
Woody Fink.
Woodrow "Woody" Fink (Matthew Timmons) from Cleveland, Ohio, is Cody Martin's cabin-mate on the SS "Tipton". He is known for being messy, disorganized, gullible, dimwitted, lazy, gluttonous and having bad grades at school. His catchphrases are "Hurtful!" and "Dang it!" In "Flowers and Chocolate", Woody had a huge crush on London's best friend Chelsea Brimmer and he pretended being London's butler from England. Woody also directs, does make-up and hair and guards the studio for London's web show "Yay Me! Starring London Tipton". Woody also can direct passed wind to sound like different songs. In the episode "Sea Monster Mash", he mentions that he has brothers and friends off the ship that aren't smart. It is also revealed that he has a younger sister who is much bigger than he is. Though, in one episode, he state that, "Being the youngest of 9, I learned to fend for myself, you wouldn't know, being an 'only-child.'" In a few episodes of the series ("International Dateline", "Goin' Bananas", "Marriage 101") he has been interested in a female student named Addison who has also shown possible interest in him. He then went out with a girl named Becky in "Smarticle Particles". In Rat Tale after he gets bitten by Buck (Cody and Bailey's pet rat) he thinks he mutates into a human-rat hybrid and later he saves Buck from falling off of an extremely high place, and does amazing acrobatic feats. Addison and Woody become a couple in several episodes.
Emma Tutweiller.
Emma Tutweiller (Erin Cardillo) is one of the teachers at Seven Seas High, the school on board the SS "Tipton". Commonly referred to as Miss Tutweiller, Emma is very enthusiastic about her job but is often frustrated by both Cody and Bailey (her best students) and Zack, London, and Woody (whom she considers her worst students). In several episodes, Emma has been shown to have self-esteem and/or relationship issues; a running gag has her abruptly making comments or outbursts about various failed relationships while speaking to the kids, often causing her embarrassment. Mr. Moseby has dated her in the episode "Sea Harmony" and has a crush on her, as became clear in "The Play's The Thing", when he tried to make her love him using Zack's help. Emma is also very fond of cats; in the third season it was revealed that she keeps at least 31 Siamese cats in her cabin. In "Prom Night", she and Moseby are confirmed to be dating. Miss Tutweiller did not have her own prom on the show, but she said that she ripped a tiara off a blond haired girl to get a tiara for prom. In the episode "Graduation on Deck", Mr. Moseby proposes to her, she accepts and the two become engaged.
Kirby Morris.
Kirby Morris (Windell D. Middlebrooks) is the ship's security guard. He first appeared in "Showgirls". He loves to eat junk food and can not get enough of it. Kirby never finished high school, so Zack and Cody help him study for the GED test allowing him to graduate. He then suffered through test anxiety as he couldn't get past the first question which was "Put name here". He played arena football and is a friend of Kurt Warner. (He also bit Kurt Warner's leg. "But I spit it back out," he says on the subject.) In "Any Given Fantasy" he coached Cody in football. In "Seven Seas News" he had a television show which was called "Boat Cops" which was exclusively made for the SS "Tipton" guests. In "Rat Tales" it is shown he likes rats and mice as he cares about Buck(Cody and Bailey's pet rat) after Bailey and Cody had an argument about who gets Buck. He is shown to love grilled cheese sandwiches.
Maya Bennett.
Maya Elizabeth Bennett (Zoey Deutch) is one of the ship's waitresses and helps Zack serve drinks. Zack has an obvious crush on her and she reciprocates but plays hard-to-get due to his 'hit-on-every-girl' attitude. She becomes the target of Zack's modified 6-month plan, originally designed by Cody. Zack eventually becomes friends with her due to receiving advice from Cody to be just friends first, then move on later. Maya catches on easily, as shown in "My, Oh Maya", where after being on the SS "Tipton" for a single day, she already knows that Zack hits on every girl on the ship. In "Das Boots" when Woody, London, Zack and Maya become trapped in London's shoe submarine and when they are all about to die because of the lack of oxygen, Maya admits she really likes Zack too. When Cody rescues the group, Maya explains that she is not yet ready to become Zack's long-term girlfriend. In "My, Oh Maya", it is revealed that she is from New York. In "Party On!" Zack throws Maya a surprise birthday party, which results in the pair sharing a kiss. It is also revealed in that episode that Maya is born sometime between March and June, and that she is a huge fan of Sean Kingston. In "Love and War", Maya has become Zack's girlfriend. She breaks up with him in "Graduation On Deck" because she got accepted into 'The Peace Corps' in Chad and didn't want a long distance relationship with Zack. He is very hurt by her leaving. After Maya tries to comfort him, he responds saying, "No, I am not your 'baby' anymore" and goes off. He is heart broken and almost doesn't go to graduation because of it. When his dad helps him though, Zack goes to graduation and at the end is seen hugging Maya, showing that they are friends despite the break-up.
Addison.
Addison (Rachael Kathryn Bell) is a student at Seven Seas High and a friend of Bailey's as shown in the episode "Roomies". She is very hyperactive and addicted to candy, thus often talks very rapidly and in a rambling fashion that sometimes confuses other people. She appeared in the episodes "International Dateline", "Kitchen Casanova", "Goin' Bananas", "Marriage 101", "The Play's the Thing", "Prom Night" and "Graduation on Deck", and she was also mentioned in the episode "Flowers and Chocolate". In the episode "Goin' Bananas" it was shown that Addison also has a terrible fear of ping-pong balls (even after she got help with Mr.Blanket though says she played one round of ping-pong and only cried twice).
Throughout her appearances on the show Addison and Woody have shown an attraction to each other. In the episode "Kitchen Casanova" Woody would take a home economics class in order to be close to her, and in "Goin' Bananas" they briefly end up dating via their characters in an online role-playing game without realizing it. In "Marriage 101" Addison marries Woody for a class assignment and Marcus became their baby. She also shows that she is good at arm wrestling and apparently weighs 83 pounds. She was Woody's date to Seven Seas High's senior prom, officially becoming his girlfriend afterwards, and would graduate with the rest of the class in the final episode "Graduation on Deck".
Carey Martin.
Carey Martin (Kim Rhodes) is Zack and Cody's mother and a singer. She appeared on the first episode "The Suite Life Sets Sail" and has since appeared in "Mom and Dad on Deck", "Trouble in Tokyo" and "Graduation on Deck". She was also a main character on "The Suite Life of Zack & Cody".
Kurt Martin.
Kurt Martin (Robert Torti) is Zack and Cody's father and a rockstar. He appeared on "Mom and Dad on Deck" and "Graduation On Deck".
Mrs. Pepperman.
Mrs. Pepperman (Lillian Adams) has appeared in three episodes. She first appeared in "Parrot Island" in the group of people that was angry for going to Parrot Island instead of Europe. She later appeared in "International Dateline" as a member of the senior citizens karate class. She was in the senior citizens activities class in "The Wrong Stuff". When things don't go her way she says a long and annoying "NOOOOOOO." She has only been in season 1, but is mentioned throughout the series.
Mr. Blanket.
Mr. Blanket (Michael Hitchcock) is the guidance counselor at Seven Seas High and the ship's resident psychologist—he even wrote a book on counseling, though he has never actually studied psychology. He is known for his extremely unorthodox approaches to helping people with their issues, which he refers to as "the Blanket Method" where he does bizarre things like handcuffing Zack and Mr. Moseby to each other (this has often caused people such as Zack and London to call him crazy), but he has successfully helped various people on the SS "Tipton" deal with their problems. He is good at making dolls and once made dolls of Zack, Mr. Moseby, and Ms. Tutweiller (whom he has a crush on). He is obsessed with cupcakes. In the episode "The Defiant Ones" he falls off the ship, though he would later reappear in the episode "Mean Chicks". Mr. Blanket also has an addiction to sniffing rabbits. His degree is on the other side of a menu. Ms. Tutweiller filed a restraining order against him and is required to come "no closer than 100 feet".
Arwin Hawkhauser.
Arwin Hawkhauser is the kooky stationary engineer at the Tipton Hotel. He is a friend of Zack and Cody's and has a crush on their mother. He appears in the episodes "Computer Date", "Its all Greek to me", and "Graduation on Deck". According to the episode "Its all Greek to me" Arwin has a cousin named Milos who lives in Greece.
Moose.
Moose (Hutch Dano) is Bailey's ex-boyfriend before she left Kansas. In "Mulch Ado About Nothing", London invites Moose to the ship so Bailey isn't as homesick, and that was making Cody angry. After Moose becomes elected to receive the Mulch Crown, he asks Bailey to return to Kansas, which upsets Cody. Cody then convinces a confused Bailey to follow her heart, and in turn, causes her to reject Moose's invite, saying he is too bossy and thinks what is right for her, which it isn't. In "Twister: Part 2", Cody and Moose compete to win Bailey back. When Bailey gets a dream of "The Wizard of Oz", Moose is portrayed as the Scarecrow and when the group comes to a crossroad, Zack, a flying monkey servant to the Wicked Witch of the West and Woody, the Cowardly Lion (although he thinks he is Chewbacca from "Star Wars") outnumber Cody, the Tin Man, on where they should go. Cody tells the group that Bailey hasn't made up her mind and, like in "Mulch to Do About Nothing", convinces Bailey to follow her heart. Bailey wakes up from the dream and tells Moose that he is a great guy, but her heart still belongs to Cody.
Tom.
Tom is a crew member who works at the juice bar with Zack. He has few appearances in the show and few speaking parts.
Frankie.
Frankie (Lisa K. Wyatt) is a crew member and handyman on the ship. She got her first appearance in "Bon Voyage" and her last appearance was on "Graduation On Deck". She really wants to be the next "Mrs. Tipton." Frankie fixes the problems on the S.S. Tipton, she isn't exactly the brightest out of the bunch. But, when there's a problem with or on the ship, shes the gal to call.
Character appearances.
This table includes only characters that have appeared in more than one episode. They are not necessarily recurring characters.

List of Miami Marlins Opening Day starting pitchers

The Miami Marlins are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in Miami, Florida. They play in the National League East division. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Marlins have used 11 different Opening Day starting pitchers in their 18 seasons. Since the Marlins' first season in , the 11 starters have a combined Opening Day record of nine wins and nine losses (9–9).
Seven Marlins pitchers have started on two or more Opening Days. Those seven are Charlie Hough, Kevin Brown, Alex Fernandez, Ryan Dempster, Josh Beckett, Dontrelle Willis, and Josh Johnson. Beckett holds the record for most Opening Day starts as a Marlin, with three appearances, from to . When playing at their home field of Land Shark Stadium, the Marlins have a record of seven wins and five losses (7–5).

The longest ever Opening Day winning streak for Marlins starting pitchers is two years, when Florida won in and under starting pitcher Josh Beckett.

Sia, le rêve du python

Sia, le rêve du python (English title: "Sia, The Dream of the Python") is a 2001 film by Burkina Faso-based filmmaker Dani Kouyaté.
Plot.
Kaya Maghan, the despotic king of Wagadou, follows the instructions of his priest by ordering the religious sacrifice to the Python God of Sia Yatabene, the virgin daughter of a notable family. A gift of gold equivalent to Sia’s weight is given to her family as compensation for surrendering their daughter for the sacrifice. However, Sia runs away and finds shelter in the home of a mad prophet who has railed against the king. The king orders his top general to locate Sia, but the general is conflicted since Sia was engaged to marry his nephew, Mamadi, who is in battle on behalf of the kingdom. Mamadi returns and joins his uncle to do battle against the Python God.
Production and release.
The inspiration of "Sia, le rêve du python" is a seventh-century myth of the Wagadu people of Western Africa, which was adapted into the play "La légende du Wagudu vue par Sia Yatabéré" by Mauritanian writer Moussa Diagana. He also adapted the screenplay with filmmaker Dani Kouyaté. 
"Sia, le rêve du python" played at the 2001 Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO), where it won the Special Jury Prize for a Feature Film. 
In May 2002, the film had its U.S. theatrical premiere. Critical reaction was mostly positive. Dave Kehr, in the "New York Times", praised Kouyate’s directing style as giving the film “a certain timeless quality,” though he noted its “measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious.” Wilson Morales, writing for BlackFilm.com, praised the film’s technical aspects, stating that the film "is visually stunning, as its costumes and settings capture the essence of what Africa looked like in ancient times." Elizabeth Zimmer of the "Village Voice" praised the timeless nature of the film’s plot, observing that "the subtitled costume drama is set in a remote African empire before cell phones, guns, and the internal combustion engine, but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow." 
"Sia, le rêve du python" was released in the U.S. on DVD in 2007 as a double-feature with another Burkinabé film, "Tasuma, The Fighter".

U.S. Route 13 in North Carolina

The section of U.S. Route 13 in North Carolina is the largest, home to of its length. It runs southwest to northeast through eastern North Carolina, beginning at Interstate 95. Most of the routing is rural, serving only three cities of considerable size along the entire route; the rest passes through forests and farmland. US 13 is usually only two lanes wide unless it is co-signed with other highways, usually near cities as bypasses.
Route description.
Interstate 95 to Newton Grove.
US 13 begins at a hybrid interchange incorporating elements of a cloverleaf, a directional-T, and a diamond, consisting of a junction with Interstate 95 (exit 38) and the Fayetteville Outer Loop near Fayetteville in Cumberland County. It quickly reduces its lane count from the four of the I-295 freeway to two lanes with dirt shoulders. It bears eastward, passing through sparsely developed forest and farm lands, quickly crossing the county border and entering Sampson County. The route turns slightly northeast and passes through Spivey's Corner, where the road intersects US 421, otherwise known as Spivey's Corner Highway.
Nearing Newton Grove, US 13 flies over Interstate 40 with no direct access. The route then enters the small town and is interrupted by a large roundabout which brings three routes—itself; North Carolina Highway 50, Raleigh Street west and Mount Olive Drive east; and US 701, Main Street north and Clinton Street south—to a central point in the city.
Newton Grove to Goldsboro.
Continuing north from Newton Grove, US 13 enters Wayne County, traveling more easterly through more farmland and forests. After several miles, it curves northeast and meets US 117 at an intersection. Here, it turns north on the four-lane, divided highway and begins to travel around the west side of Goldsboro, the beginning of a partial beltway around the city. Before turning east again, US 13 leaves US 117 at an at-grade intersection, the latter of which upgrades into a freeway. US 117 Bypass travels along with US 13.
US 13 circles around the city on a four-lane, divided freeway alignment after another at-grade intersection, immediately interchanging with NC 581. Shortly after, it meets US 70 at a partial cloverleaf interchange, and US 70 joins the other two routes on its path east. The next interchange sends US 117 Alternate north at a partial trumpet interchange; US 117 continues north to the east of its parent until they both intersect US 264. US 13 and US 70 continue east, next interchanging NC 111. The road interchanges Wayne Memorial Drive and Spence Avenue before curving southward. The freeway then interchanges with Berkeley Boulevard, where US 13 leaves. US 70 continues on the freeway, while US 13 turns northeast on Berkeley Boulevard, leaving the Goldsboro area.
Goldsboro to US 64.
US 13 continues northeast, passing through one last community of Goldsboro before entering open fields and forests once again and entering Greene County. Outside Snow Hill, NC 58 joins US 13 and becomes Kingold Boulevard. US 13 leaves Kingold Boulevard once in the center of town, continuing northeast via Contentnea Boulevard.
Contentnea Boulevard outside the city meets an intersection with US 258 and NC 903, which join US 13. The other side of the four way intersection continues as NC 91. NC 903 leaves after two curves of the road, leaving US 13 and 258 to continue northeast through farmland. US 13 leaves US 258 after a stretch, turning east to meet and run concurrent with US 264, Dickinson Avenue. This arrangement continues until Greenville, where US 264 leaves, and US 13 bisects the city on Memorial Drive, forming concurrencies with NC 43, NC 903 and NC 11. The concurrency eventually drops NC 43, and later picks up NC 33 and drops it, also dropping NC 903 before it heads northward. Still a four-lane divided road, it bypasses the town of Bethel before it meets a diamond interchange with the US 64 freeway in the corner of Edgecombe County. US 13 turns east onto this freeway, while NC 11 continues northward.
US 64 to Virginia.
US 13 and US 64 travel eastward to Williamston. The roadway curves around the south and east sides of the city, where US 17 joins and US 64 leaves. US 13/17 continue north on a four lane alignment until Williamston, where it bypasses the town to the west. On the north side, though, US 13 leaves at an interchange on North King Street, traveling north on a two-lane road, while US 17 carries the freeway east towards the ocean.
The road continues through the farm and forest medium until it enters Ahoskie on city streets, forming concurrencies with NC 42 and NC 561. These leave in the city before US 13 exits, finally crossing into Gates County along with US 158. The concurrency travels for a few miles, the roads separating before the Virginia state border. Here, US 13 continues into Virginia as Whaleyville Boulevard.
Scenic byways.

Los de Atrás Vienen Conmigo

Los de atrás vienen conmigo () is the third studio album by Puerto Rican alternative rap band Calle 13 and was released on October 21, 2008 by Sony Music Latin. This album is a bit more colorful than the previous, although dark humor continues to be the tone. The album has a fusion of rhythms the band discovered during their visits to several countries. They fuse rhythms of 'cumbia villera' native to Argentina, and rhythms of Balkan music. The album features collaborations with Rubén Blades, Café Tacuba, and Afrobeta.
Background.
Calle 13's self-titled debut album (2005) sold nearly 250,000 copies in the United States, but its darker follow-up, 2007's "Residente o Visitante", sold just under 100,000 copies, despite receiving positive reviews and winning Latin Grammy Awards for Best Urban Music Album and Best Urban Song. The record garnered controversy for its religious and sexual overtones; vocalist/lyricist Residente reflected, "The problem with "Residente o Visitante" wasn't a bad word here or there, but the ideas. You can't erase an idea."
Recording.
The album was recorded from July to August 2008 in various studios around the world including Playbach Studio in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Circle House Studio and Songo Sound Recording Facilities in Miami, Florida, Circo Beat Studios in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Warner Chapell Brasil in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Alfano Music in Panama City, Panama. It was mixed in the Circle House studio by Ivan Gutierrez and Edgardo Matta and mastered in Zeitgeist Recording Studios in Long Island City, New York.
Composition.
Music.
For "La Perla", Visitante employed samba rhythms mixed with elements of the Uruguyan candombe genre in order to achieve an "old school and folkloric" sound. The bass is provided by a surdo, a type of Brazilian bass drum commonly used in samba reggae music. "Electro Movimiento", which features Miami-based duo Afrobeta, has been described as an "'80s freestyle throwback jam" featuring electronic sounds. Colombian singer-songwriter Juanes plays guitar on "Esto Con Eso", although Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic notes that "you wouldn't know if not for the liner note credits, as there's so much else going on in the song musically."
Reception.
Chart performance.
The album became a major success on the Billboard 200, peaking at #89. This is their second consecutive album to chart on the Top 100 of the Billboard 200 ("Residente o Visitante"; #52). It also became a Top 5 success on the "Billboard" Top Latin Albums chart, peaking at #3.
Critical reception.
Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic gave "Los de Atrás Vienen Conmigo" four out of five stars and called the album "a step forward for Calle 13...toward a fearlessly experimental style of urban music unlike anything else out there at the time of its release." He praised the record's musical diversity and felt that many of the collaborative songs were highlights. Phil Freeman of "The Village Voice" also enjoyed the musical variety, deeming the album a "genre-redefining—if not genre-shattering—triumph" that combines "the fun of the debut with the sonic adventurism of the follow-up." Jon Pareles of "The New York Times" referred to Residente as "a visionary", and opined that "Few hip-hop or urban acts, in any language, match so much ambition to so much fun."
Awards.
The album was nominated in five categories for the 2009 Latin Grammy Awards, winning all of them, including 'Album of the Year', 'Best Urban Album', 'Record of the Year' and 'Best Alternative Song' for the hit single "No Hay Nadie Como Tu" along with Café Tacuba, as well as 'Best Music Video (in Short Format)' for "La Perla" featuring salsa legend Rubén Blades.

Planche (exercise)

A Planche is a skill in gymnastics in which the body is held parallel to the ground, giving the illusion of floating. It is a move that requires a great deal of strength and balance. 
There are many variations of a Planche, although only two are accredited in artistic gymnastics: the straddle Planche, and the straight legged Planche. Somewhat less well known is the double planar Planche. Depending on the event, it can range from a B to a D skill, and must be held for at least 2 seconds. This move is also done commonly in break dancing (known as a no legged or Planche pushup). The muscles used in this exercise are the chest, shoulders, upper back, lower back, and glutes. 
There are many ways to train for a Planche. The most common method of training in a gymnastic discipline of this skill involves progressions. A progression is a certain stage of skill; an athlete's ability to do the skill can be measured at each progression. Usually they are either trained in sets of strength or time. Strength training would involve trying as hard as possible to reach the next progression for a small amount of time. A timed hold is simply staying at one progression and holding it for a certain amount of time. Usually an athlete tries the next progression after they could hold a progression in good form for 60 seconds.
The progression is usually frog stand, advanced frog stand, tuck planche, advanced tuck planche, straddle planche, then full planche. The arms should be locked at all times in all positions, except frog stand.
Useful Vocabulary:
Progression
A Progression is a "distinct" physical position: typically one of a series of increasing difficulty culminating in the desired position. There are five mainstream progressions for a Planche.

Alibi Bye Bye

Alibi Bye Bye is a 1935 comedy short directed by Ben Holmes and released by RKO Radio Pictures. It is notable as the final film appearance of the comedy team of Bobby Clark and Paul McCullough.
Plot.
Clark and McCullough are Flash and Blodgett, a pair of "alibi photographers" operating a studio in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The pair cater to a clientele who require fraudulent tourist photographs using fake backdrops, which can later be used as evidence that the person in the photograph was at any location in the country. One day, a married couple (Bud Jamison and Constance Bergen) turn up separately in need of alibi photographs: the man wants evidence of being on a Maine moose hunt while the woman needs photographic proof of being in Washington, D.C. The photographers, unaware that the man and woman are married, decide to play matchmaker with the pair. By coincidence, the man and woman have rooms opposite each other in the same hotel. The hotel’s manager and the staff detective become suspicious of what is transpiring when the photographers and the couple zigzag between the rooms. Eventually, the husband and wife discover the truth of their activities and leave the hotel together. The photographers, however, attempt to leave the hotel disguised as a moose, only to be chased amidst gunfire from the hotel manager.
Production history.
Bobby Clark and Paul McCullough worked in circuses, vaudeville and on Broadway for two decades before they came to Hollywood to star in a series of short films. They first worked for Fox Pictures from 1929 to 1930 and then at RKO Radio Pictures from 1931 to 1935. The duo made 21 films at RKO.
"Alibi Bye Bye," with its suggestive humor regarding adultery, ran afoul with the Kansas Board of Review, the state's motion picture censorship board. "Eliminate all indecent reactions of Clark after seeing a woman," wrote the board after screening the film, noting Bobby Clark's lascivious reactions to a pretty chambermaid in the film. "These are tom cat growls and pawing of earth. They occur several times in both reels."
Paul McCullough's death.
Following the completion of "Alibi Bye Bye", Clark and McCullough returned to the stage for national tour of the revue "Thumbs Up!" The team was expected to return to Hollywood, but McCullough was in poor health. In early 1936, McCullough checked into a sanitarium in Massachusetts for undisclosed medical reasons. On March 23, 1936, McCullough was checked out of the sanitarium and stopped by a barber shop in Medford, Massachusetts for a shave. At the barber shop, he grabbed the razor and slashed his throat and wrists. He was taken to a hospital in Boston, where he died two days later.
Clark continued as a solo performer following his partner’s death, concentrating almost exclusively on the stage. He only made one film without McCullough, the 1938 extravaganza "The Goldwyn Follies".

U Škripcu

U Škripcu (Serbian Cyrillic: У Шкрипцу; trans. "In Dire Straits") was a Serbian and former Yugoslav rock band from Belgrade.
The band was formed in 1980 by Zoran Vulović "Vule" (keyboards), Milan Delčić "Delča" (vocals) and Aleksandar Vasiljević "Vasa" (guitar), who decided to expand the lineup of their former band to Miloš Obrenović (drums) and Aleksandar Lukić (bass guitar), and change their name to U Škripcu. At the time of their formation, the band was a part of the Yugoslav New Wave scene, the period of work which was documented on the seminal 1981 various artists compilation album "Artistička radna akcija". With the debut album release, the 1982 "Godine ljubavi", the band moved towards a more experimental post-punk sound, before achieving nationwide commercial success with the release of the album "O je!" and EP "Nove godine!", under the influence of New Romanticism. The original lineup recorded yet another album, the synthpop "Budimo zajedno", which was did not repeat the commercial success of its predecessors, causing the band to disband in 1985.
In 1986, Vulović and Delčić reformed the band, but the latter soon left the band, so the new lineup, featuring the vocalist Aleksandar Tabaš and various musicians, recorded the fourth studio album, "U Škripcu". Despite the hit song "Vreme je za nas", the album was not commercially successful, causing the band to disband in 1988. The following year, Vulović reunited with Delčić and Vasiljević, Lukić on guitar, bassist Dejan Škopelja, and drummer Ratko Ljubičić. The lineup recorded the critically acclaimed fifth studio album "Izgleda da mi smo sami", after which the band disbanded. Following the disbandment, Vulović became a producer and manager, Delčić pursued a solo career with his band Sklekovi, and Vasiljević and Lukić became a part of the supergroup Familija. In 2007, the original lineup reunited at the Delča i Sklekovi concert at the Belgrade Dom Omladine, which was released in 2008 as "Ljubilarnih 20 i nešto godina - Live", under the moniker Delča a i U Škripcu. Delčić died on 24 July 2011, after spending a decade fighting cancer.
History.
Original lineup years (1980-1985).
The band was formed by three high school friends Zoran "Vule" Vulović (keyboards), Milan "Delča" Delčić (vocals, guitar for a short period of time) and Aleksandar "Vasa" Vasiljević (guitar). The three used to write amateur theatre plays and in 1979 decided to form a band. The group was initially called Prolog Za Veliki Haos ("Intro for the Great Chaos") and then Furije Furiozno Furaju. The three also worked as associate journalists for the "Mladi novi svet" show airing on Studio B radio station.
In 1980 the band was renamed U Škripcu, adding two more members, drummer Miloš Obrenović and bassist Aleksandar "Luka" Lukić. The band's first recordings, tracks "Južno voće" ("Tropical Fruit") and "Pamflex dom" ("Pamflex Home") were released on the "Artistička radna akcija" compilation, which featured the second generation of Belgrade New Wave bands, in 1981. The beginning of their career is also connected to the "Pamflex" concept. Pamflex was an imaginary company, invented by Delčić. The songs were actually commercials for imaginary products, as the band members considered advertising to be the finest form of art. Part of the concept was also reading of ironic and comical speeches, usage of Pamflex flags and using theater language style.
During 1981, the band had numerous live appearances in Belgrade and Zagreb, and soon established a fanbase. Their debut album "Godine ljubavi" ("Years of Love"), released by PGP-RTB in 1982, did not feature Lukić on bass guitar, who was at the time serving the mandatory Yugoslav People's Army stint, and was replaced by Idoli bassist Zdenko Kolar, who recorded bass sections. During the tour, Dejan Grujić from the band Braća played bass. The band established a team of co-workers who collaborated on their next releases, producer Saša Habić and album artwork design group Aux Maniere (Slobodan Šajin and Momčilo Rajin). The album's most notable tracks were "Ti imaš dosta godina" ("You Have Plenty of Years"), "Hamuamule", "Samuraj" ("Samurai"), "Kao u boji" ("Like in Color") and "Proleće" ("Spring"), dealing with various theme orientations. After the album release, Saša Dragić became the band's manager.
In 1983, the band signed a contract with Jugoton and released the album "O je!" ("Oh, Yeah!") and the EP "Nove godine!" ("New Years!"). The album was well accepted by the audience and the critics and the "Rock" magazine voted the album the best release of 1983. Guest appearances featured Gordi bassist and arranger Slobodan Svrdlan, Đorđe Petrović on keyboards, Nenad Jelić on percussion and Jovan Maljoković on saxophone. The tracks "Beograd spava" ("Belgrade Is Sleeping"), "Kockar" ("Gambler") and "Siđi do reke" ("Come down to the River") were the most notable tracks on the album. The "Nove godine!" EP was intentionally released during the New Year holidays and featured five songs including the title track, also released on single, and the hit "Koliko imaš godina" ("How Old Are You").
In 1984, Lukić returned to the band and together they toured mainly in Croatia and in 1985 the band released "Budimo zajedno!" ("Let's Be Together!") which was a combination of pop and electronic music. It featured a new version of "Hamuamule", "Tama me prati" ("Darkness Follows Me"), "Crni anđele" ("Black Angel"), "Baj, baj" ("Bye, Bye"). Due to the inability to achieve the success of the previous records the band ceased to exist.
Reformation with new lineup (1986-1987).
Delčić finished drama studies at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Belgrade and started writing theatre plays. Vasić and Lukić worked as producers and with Obrenović and Aleksandar Ralev formed the pop rock band Košava. Vulović, having returned from the Yugoslav People's Army decided to form his own band, Bang Bang, featuring himself on vocals. Since Delčić became a part of the project, the two decided to reform U Škripcu in 1986. They recorded new material with musicians from Zagreb, drummer Davor Vidiš (from Kristalno Plavo), bassist Dario Kumele and guitarist Zdravko Jurković. In the meantime Delčić went to serve the Yugoslav People's Army, so Vulović decided to change the lineup featuring musicians from Belgrade, vocalist Aleksandar Tabaš, bassist Dejan "Škopi" Škopelja, guitarist Zoran Veljković and drummer Marko Milivojević. The 1987 self-titled album was produced by Rijan Nemurin, and guest appearances featured Aleksandar Vasiljević and Vlada Negovanović. The album was not commercially successful, the only track becoming a minor hit was "Vreme je za nas" ("It Is Time for Us"), and the band disbanded.
Original members reunion (1989-1991).
Delčić, having returned from the army, started preparing his first solo album. The album was never released and U Škripcu reunited once again featuring original members Lukić, Vulović, Delčić, Vasiljević, bassist Dejan "Škopi" Škopelja and Disciplina Kičme drummer Ratko Ljubičić. The band released "Izgleda da mi smo sami" ("It Looks like We're Alone") in 1990. It was produced by Lukić and Vasiljević and, beside the title track, "Ako ti kažem (Je, je, je)" ("If I Say to You (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)") became popular songs. On the retrospective evening of the "Belgrade Spring" festival, the band performed a cover version of "Stjuardesa" ("Stewardess") originally performed by Radoslav Grajić, and the recording appeared on the "Beograde" compilation in 1991.
When the Yugoslav wars started, the band became inactive and reformed only for major events like the student's protests, Gitarijada festival, and others, and in the meantime prepared some new material, which was never released. Part of the material was used on the Familija debut album "Narodno pozorište", featuring Vasiljević and Lukić and Vampiri members Dejan "Peja" Pejović, Dejan "Dexi" Petrović and Goran "Gedža" Redžepi. The material written by Delčić appeared on his first solo album "Delča & Sklekovi".
Post-breakup and 2007 reunion.
In 2000, the band's song "Ako ti kažem (Je, je, je)" appeared on the Taped Pictures various artists compilation "Automania 2 - Pop Hidraulic". In 2006, on the Delča & Sklekovi concert at Belgrade's Dom Omladine, the original U Škripcu members appeared as guests. In December 2008, a live album was released, entitled "Ljubilarnih 20 i nešto godina - Live", recorded at the band's 2006 performance in Dom Omladine, released as Delča a i U Škripcu ("Delča, but also U Škripcu"). Delčić stated that the release of the album is not a comeback album or the announcement of the band's reunion.
Delčić died on 24 July 2011 after spending several years fighting cancer.
Legacy.
In 2011, the alternative rock band Block Out released a cover of "Beograd spava" as a single. In 2012, former Dorian Gray frontman Massimo Savić covered the song "Siđi do reke", as a tribute to Delčić, during his performance at the Belgrade Sava Centar venue.
In 2006, the song "Siđi do reke" was ranked No. 71 on the B92 Top 100 Domestic Songs list. In 2011, the song "Izgleda da mi smo sami" was polled, by the listeners of Radio 202, one of 60 greatest songs released by PGP-RTB/PGP-RTS during the sixty years of the label's existence.
In September 2013, a commemorative plaque in memory of Delčić was revealed in Mila Jevtović Street in Belgrade, on the house in which he lived.

North Carolina Highway 13

North Carolina Highway 13 was a primary state highway in the state of North Carolina. It had existed in four separate incarnations in Eastern North Carolina.
First NC 13.
The first NC 13 was one of the original 1921 set of numbered North Carolina Highways. It ran northward from a junction with NC 10 in Durham, passing through Rougemont, Timberlake, and Roxboro before reaching the Virginia state line where it met what was then VA 18. In 1925, the routing between Timberlake and Roxboro was straightened. In 1927, the entirety of NC 13 was made part of the route of US 501. In 1930, the concurrent state highway number for this part of US 501 was changed to NC 55, ending the first NC 13.
Second NC 13.
The second NC 13 was a short lived route, appearing only on 1935 state highway map as replacement for NC 21 from Raleigh to Creedmoor at a junction with US 15 and NC 56. By the following year it had been resigned as part of US 15-A 
Third NC 13.
The third NC 13 was established in 1936 on a new primary highway route running from US 220 north of Seagrove northeast to US 421 in Staley. When US 13 was extended into North Carolina in 1951, rather than renumbering NC 13, it was simply demoted to secondary highway status except for the portion that was near NC 42.
Fourth NC 13.
The northern terminus of the Fayetteville Outer Loop meets the southern terminus of US 13 at I-95 northeast of Fayetteville. It was not initially known whether it would be approved by American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) as an extension of US 13 or an auxiliary of I-95, so it was indicated on the 2004 and 2005 North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) highway maps as NC 13, though it was never signed as such in the field. The designation was dropped once AASHTO approved designating the loop as I-295 in 2005.

Lydia Thompson

Lydia Thompson, born Eliza Hodges Thompson (19 February 1838 – 17 November 1908), was an English dancer, comedian, actress and theatrical producer. 
After dancing and performing in pantomimes in Britain and then in Europe as a teenager in the 1850s, she became a leading dancer and actress in burlesques on the London stage. She introduced Victorian burlesque to America with her troupe the "British Blondes", in 1868, to great acclaim and notoriety. Her career began to decline in the 1890s, but she continued to perform into the early years of the 20th century.
Early years.
Thompson was born in Brydges Street, Covent Garden, London. Her father was Philip Thompson (c.1801–1842) and her mother was Eliza ("née" Cooper). Her father owned the Sheridan Knowles, a public house. Thompson was the second of three surviving children, including actress Clara T. Bracy. Her father died in 1842, and her mother remarried Edward Hodges. By the age of fourteen, Thompson had left home and joined the stage professionally as a dancer.
In 1852 she became a member of the corps de ballet at Her Majesty's Theatre. By the following year she was playing a solo role, Little Silverhair, in the pantomime "Harlequin and the Three Bears, or, Little Silverhair and the Fairies" at the Haymarket Theatre. In 1854 she danced at the old Globe Theatre in Blackfriars Road, in James Planché's extravaganza, "Mr Buckstone's Voyage Round the Globe". She gained wider public attention later that year at the St James's Theatre in "The Spanish Dancers", a burletta by Thomas Selby, playing the famous dancer Señora Perea Nena. "The Times" dismissed the piece but praised her performance highly: "It was no burlesque; it was one excellent dancer following in the steps of another, catching the spirit of her model, and rivalling her in the audacity of her execution. The youth and beauty of Miss Thompson gave an additional charm to her Andalusian feats." 
There, she also played in the burlesque "Ganem, the Slave of Love", and in the ballet-farce "Magic Toys". These performances brought a period of prosperity to what had come to be regarded as one of the unluckiest theatres in London. She also appeared that year in "The King's Rival" by Tom Taylor and Charles Reade (J. L. Toole's first London role), "Beauties of the Harem", and, again at the Haymarket, in the title role in the Christmas pantomime "Little Bo Peep, or, Harlequin and the Girl who Lost her Sheep". She then returned to complete the season at the St James's in "Cupid's Ladder" and the fairy spectacle, "The Swan and Edgar".
Star dancer.
Still a teenager, Thompson then toured through Europe for over three years. She danced in Russia, Germany, Austria, France, Scandinavia and elsewhere, "winning acclaim for the dexterity of her dancing – which included the Highland Fling and Hornpipe – as well as the charms of her person and the vivacity of her character." She returned to England in the summer of 1859, by which time "The Times" referred to her as "one of the most eminent of English dancers". 
In the winter season of 1859–60 Thompson danced at the St James's in several pieces, including "Virginius, or, The Trials of a Fond Papa", Lester Buckingham's burlesque "Virginus", Valentine in "Magic Toys", Dolly Mayflower in "Black-Eyed Susan" and Young Norval in the ballet-burlesque "My Name is Norval". In 1860–1861, at the Lyceum Theatre, she played again in "Magic Toys", as Morgiana in the Savage Club burlesque of "The Forty Thieves", in the farce "The Middy Asthore", as Fanchette in George Loder's "The Pets of the Parterre" ("Les Fleurs animées") and as Mephisto in the fairy extravaganza "Chrystabelle, or the Rose Without a Thorn". She also played Norah in the first production of Edmund Falconer's comedy "Woman, or, Love Against the World", as Blondinette in "Little Red Riding Hood" and had a role in the William Brough burlesque of "The Colleen Bawn", called "The Colleen Bawn Settled at Last". 
Thompson married John Christian Tilbury, a riding-master, in 1863, and soon gave birth to a daughter. She returned to the stage in "The Alabama" at the Drury Lane Theatre. Her husband died fifteen months after their marriage, in a steeplechasing accident in 1864, when he was rolled on by his horse. In the following years, she alternated between London and provincial tours, mixing dancing and acting in plays. In 1864, at the opening of the new Theatre Royal, Birkenhead, managed by Alexander Henderson (1828–1886), she created the title role in a burlesque of "Ixion" by Francis Burnand. She joined Henderson's company at Prince of Wales's Theatre, Liverpool, together with the rising young actors Squire Bancroft, Marie Wilton and Henry Irving. There, she played in Brough's "Ernani" (1865), as Max in a burlesque of Weber's "Der Freischütz" (1866), as Prince Buttercup in "The White Fawn", as Massaroni in the burlesque "The Brigand", and as Prince Florizel in another burlesque, "Perdita". Thompson excelled as "principal boy" in burlesques: "She was charming to look at, a good singer, a really clever dancer, and the life and soul of the scene while on the stage." Other successful London runs from 1866–1868 included, at the Drury Lane, Sophonisba in Delibes' "Wanted Husbands For Six" ("Six Demoiselles à marier") and at the Strand Theatre, "Blue-Beard" (after Jacques Offenbach's version) and Darnley in the very successful "The Field of the Cloth of Gold".
America and later years.
Thompson married Henderson, and the two sailed in August 1868 for America, heading a small theatrical troupe, adapting popular English burlesques for middle-class New York audiences by adding topical and local references and reworking the lyrics of popular songs, while preserving the rhymed couplets and comic puns of the burlesque form. 
Thompson's troupe, called the "British Blondes", was the most popular entertainment in New York during the 1868–1869 theatrical season: "The eccentricities of pantomime and burlesque – with their curious combination of comedy, parody, satire, improvisation, song and dance, variety acts, cross-dressing, extravagant stage effects, risqué jokes and saucy costumes – while familiar enough to British audiences, took New York by storm." The six-month tour turned into an extremely successful tour of almost six years, and during two subsequent tours, the Blondes drew huge crowds at leading theatres across the U.S. The troupe launched careers of several actresses, including Markham, Alice Burville and Rose Coghlan, and of comedian Willie Edouin. It also drew fierce criticism from those who felt it transgressed the boundaries of propriety. Reflections on the virtue of her dancers by Wilbur F. Storey, the owner of the "Chicago Times", led Thompson and her troupe first to post notices calling Storey "a liar and a coward" and appealing for the sympathy of the people. Then, on 24 February 1870, Thompson, her husband and her colleague, Pauline Markham, horsewhipped Storey at gunpoint, for which they were arrested and fined. Thompson told a reporter that Storey "had called her by the most odious epithet that could be applied to a woman, and she could stand it no longer. She was glad at what she had done." This resulted in more publicity and popularity for the troupe. Actress Olive Logan protested, "I cannot advise any woman to go upon the stage with the demoralizing influence which seems here to prevail more every day, when its greatest rewards are won by brazen-faced, stained, yellow-haired, padded-limbed creatures, while actresses of the old school – well trained, decent – cannot earn a living." 
Thompson, Henderson and her troupe finally returned to England in 1874, and she resumed her starring roles in London and provincial productions, including H. B. Farnie's burlesques of "Bluebeard" (which she had already made a hit in America) and "Robinson Crusoe", and Robert Reece's "Carmen, or, Sold for a Song", as well as "Piff-Paff" ("Le Grand Duc de Matapa"), "Oxygen", "The Lady of Lyons", "Pluto!", and other burlesques. Henderson purchased the Folly Theatre in 1876, and it became a burlesque house, with Thompson in the lead roles. The first piece was a production of "Bluebeard". In the following years, Thompson returned to America several times, where she remained popular. Thompson separated from Herderson, but the two continued to work together into the 1880s. In 1881, after two years in retirement, she returned to the stage as Mrs Kingfisher in the farce "Dust". 
Thompson returned to New York following the death of Henderson in 1886 and again in the winter seasons of 1888 and 1891. In 1887 she opened at the Royal Strand Theatre, London, under her own management, in Alfred Cellier's comic opera, "The Sultan of Mocha". She next starred in the French vaudeville-opérette "Babette" (1888, Antonio), but her voice was judged inadequate. After this, her career began to decline. Her last American performances were in 1894 in "The Crust of Society" in a supporting role. Back in London, George Edwardes cast her briefly in the Edwardian musical comedy "An Artist's Model" (1895), but by 1899, she had depleted her funds. A London benefit night was held for her on 2 May 1899 at the Lyceum Theatre, when she performed in "The Wedding March" by W. S. Gilbert. She also recited a rhymed "farewell address" written for her by Gilbert. Her final performances were in 1904, as the Duchesse du Albuquerque in "A Queen's Romance". 
Thompson died in London at the age of 70. She is buried in Kensal Green cemetery. Her daughter, Zeffie Agnes Lydia Tilbury, became an actress known first on the London stage and later for playing wise or evil older characters in films, such as Grandma in "The Grapes of Wrath" (1940) and Grandma Lester in "Tobacco Road" (1941).

The New Game

The New Game is the fourth studio album by the American heavy metal band Mudvayne. It was released on November 18, 2008 by Epic Records, and its first single, "Do What You Do," began receiving airplay on September 23, 2008. The album debuted and peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard 200, selling 48,000 copies in its first week, and more than 215,000 copies in the United States .
Recording and production.
Studio work for the album was put on hold in mid 2007 due to vocalist Chad Gray's and guitarist Greg Tribbett's touring commitments with Hellyeah. At the completion of the Hellyeah tour, Mudvayne reunited and began recording with producer Dave Fortman, who also produced their previous full-length release, "Lost and Found". Having completed the tracking of the drums and guitars, as well as the recording of the bass and vocals, the band announced that the mastering stages were scheduled for completion by October 1, 2008. During the recording phase, Fortman revealed to MTV the tentative title "The New Game", adding that the band planned to release a second full-length record six months after its release.
Promotion.
A video previewing a possible album track was uploaded to Mudvayne's MySpace profile on July 16, 2008. A second video appeared on the profile on August 19 showing Gray tracking vocals. The second video was later made a feature on the band's official website. On September 16, 30-second previews of "Fish Out of Water," "A New Game" and "Do What You Do" were made available for streaming on the profile. The first single, "Do What You Do," first received airplay on September 23. Mudvayne also shot a video for "A New Game" and released a second single to radio, "Scarlet Letters," that was first broadcast on March 9, 2008.
A bonus song, "Fish Out of Water," was made available for download to customers who pre-ordered "The New Game" on the iTunes Store, or through Best Buy, and the deluxe digital version of the album also included a digital copy of "By the People, for the People". On October 28, 2008, "Have it Your Way" was released exclusively by "Revolver" magazine through its website.
Musical and lyrical themes.
Fortman said the album should please listeners, but also incorporate a distinct rock and roll sound unheard on previous Mudvayne records. "It's heavy and has great hooks, but it also has some moments that are a little more rock 'n' roll that are really cool. It's not anything drastic, but every now and then you'll catch a little hint of old school rock. Also, the tones are a little more earthy sounding and a little warmer than "Lost and Found"." Singer Chad Gray has stated the album is "not light years away from what we've done in the past, but it's not the same." The album's sound has been compared to Alice in Chains and Motörhead.
Reception.
The album has received mixed reviews from critics. James Christopher Monger of Allmusic gave the album a mixed review and wrote "The problem is, Mudvayne's own predilection for predictable loud/soft/loud set pieces, forgettable melodies, and over-reliance on words like "sorrow," "rage," "abused," "disease," "nightmares," and "beatings" keeps things from ever leaving the tarmac."
Legacy.
The album versions of "Do What You Do" and "Dull Boy" appeared on the compilation "Playlist: The Very Best of Mudvayne", released by Legacy Recordings in 2011.

The Dreamers (unfinished film)

The Dreamers is an unfinished and unreleased film project directed and produced between 1980 and 1982 by Orson Welles.
Production history.
In 1979, Welles and Oja Kodar, the Croatian actress and writer who was Welles' companion in his later years, collaborated on a screenplay based on two stories from Karen Blixen, "The Dreamers" and "Echoes". Henry Jaglom, the U.S. filmmaker who directed Welles in the 1971 feature "A Safe Place", made inquiries to potential investors to back this project, which was originally called "Da Capo". Northstar Productions, a company created by filmmaker Hal Ashby, provided Welles with funding to complete the script, but declined to pursue the project after reading the completed script.
Welles shot 20 minutes of 35mm footage based on the screenplay, using his Hollywood home as the set for the film.
It remains unclear whether Welles intended the footage to be used strictly as a test reel to pique the interest of potential investors, or whether Welles planned to complete production of the screenplay. Kodar has stated that Welles was prepared to go forward with a full production after the screenplay was rejected by the BBC and Miramax, but cinematographer Gary Graver, who shot the footage, has stated Welles never intended to self-finance the film and would not have gone further on the project without outside financing.
The footage.
The footage for "The Dreamers" consists of two segments running 10 minutes each. The first segment was shot in black-and-white and involves Welles in costume and make-up as a 19th-century Dutch-Jewish merchant who recounts the story of Pellegrina Leoni, an Italian opera diva who mysteriously disappeared after losing the ability to sing.
The second segment was shot in color and features Kodar as Pellegrina, who declares her farewell to her merchant friend while announcing that she is disappearing to seek a new anonymous life. Part of the Kodar footage was shot outdoors in the garden of Welles' home.
No other actors appear in the footage. Kodar would later recall Welles toying with the idea of casting Timothy Dalton, Peter Ustinov, Oliver Reed, Bud Cort, and Jeanne Moreau. However, Graver later stated that Welles was planning to use younger and lesser known British actors.
Aftermath.
Welles never acquired financial backing for this project and a full production of "The Dreamers" never came to fruition. The surviving footage is archived in Germany's Munich Filmmuseum, and it has been made public in several film festivals and retrospectives of Welles' work. Parts of the footage were included in the documentary "Orson Welles: The One-Man Band" and as a special feature on the Criterion DVD release of Welles' 1973 feature "F for Fake."
In 1994, Peter Bogdanovich reportedly planned to make "The Dreamers," but the production never came about. In 1996, the rights to the Dinesen source material was purchased from Kodar by Andy Howard, who was Welles' business manager during the final years of his life. To date, Howard has not brought Welles' concept of "The Dreamers" to the screen.

Federal Crop Insurance Corporation

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) is a wholly owned government corporation managed by the Risk Management Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture. FCIC manages the federal crop insurance program, which provides U.S. farmers and agricultural entities with crop insurance protection.
Agency history.
FCIC was created by the United States Congress in legislation that passed on February 16, 1938 (7 U.S.C. § 1501). The legislation was created in response to the economic difficulties brought to the U.S. farming industry by the Great Depression and the weather-related catastrophe of the Dust Bowl. On September 26, 1980, the program was expanded through Public Law 96-365. 
Initially, participation in FCIC was voluntary. However, insurance premiums were subsidized by the U.S. government as a means of encouraging participation in the FCIC program. This changed with the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, which required farmers to participate in the program in order to be eligible for deficiency payments related to certain FCIC programs. Mandatory participation was repealed in 1996.
An independent office designed to supervise and monitor FCIC activities was mandated in the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (P.L.104-127). The Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 (ARPA) made amendments, providing for FCIC to offer a wider selection of insurance-related risk management tools to farmers and agricultural entities.
Financial claims.
Between 1980 and 2005, FCIC recorded $43.6 billion in total claims, averaging approximately $1.7 billion in losses per year. Three-quarters of FCIC claims result three weather-related disasters – drought, excess moisture, and hail – with the remaining claims divided among 27 different causes, including crop-damaging frost and tornados.
Biotech coverage expansion.
In September 2008, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved the expansion of the FCIC’s risk management program to include agricultural producers involved in the planting and harvesting of certain biotech corn hybrid seeds that are designed to be resistant to damage from lepidoptera pests (including moths and their larvae) and below-ground corn rootworm damage. The biotech corn hybrid seeds must also show tolerance to certain herbicides. FCIC coverage for the biotech corn hybrid seeds went into effect in 2009.

Cégep de Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu

The Cégep Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu is a post-secondary education institution (cégep: College of General and Professional Education) located in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, province of Quebec, Canada. The enabling legislation is the "General and Vocational Colleges Act" 
History.
The Cégep de Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu traces its origins to the merger of several institutions which became public ones in 1967, when the Quebec system of CEGEPs was created.
Programs.
Quebec students complete one fewer grade than all other Canadian provinces in total before attending CEGEP de Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, by ending high school in grade 11 instead of grade 12. CEGEP de Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu then prepared students for university or to enter a technical profession. Most of the Cégep’s technical programs are delivered through the Bureau de liaison avec l’entreprise (BLE – business liaison office) which coordinates internships to students in Quebec and abroad. The Province of Quebec awards a Diploma of Collegial Studies for two types of programs: two years of pre-university studies or three years of vocational (technical) studies.
It is also possible to attend a university with a 3 year technical CEGEP de Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu diploma. The CEGEP de Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu offers two types of programs: pre-university and technical. The pre-university programs, which take two years to complete, cover the subject matters which roughly correspond to the additional year of high school given elsewhere in Canada in preparation for a chosen field in university. The technical programs, which take three-years to complete, applies to students who wish to pursue a skilled trade.
Facilities.
Actiforme Consultants manages the Cégep’s fitness centre. A Memorandum of Understanding between the city and the Cégep de Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu covers maintenance of outdoor sports fields (football, soccer, tennis, softball). In exchange, municipal sports teams can use these fields free of charge after class times. The Cégep contracted management of its performance hall, Théâtre des Deux 
Rives, to a local non-profit organization.
Development Fund.
To support the growth of the Cégep de Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, the Development fund organizes various fundraising activities, for example an annual golf tournament.
