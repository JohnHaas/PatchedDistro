Scoring music for over 600 feature films, Bhaskar worked in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Marathi, Tulu and Konkani language films as well. He was a part of all of popular Kannada film director KSL Swamy's(Ravi) movies and was also known for his association with acclaimed director Puttanna Kanagal.
Influenced by R C Boral and Mukul Mehta, Bhaskar developed his own style of music and introduced the concept of theme music in Kannada film industry. He is credited for inspiring producers to select popular works of Kannada poets through his music.

Biography.
Career.
Vijaya Bhaskar started training early. His guru in Hindustani Classical music was Govinda Bhave who taught him the basics. Vijaya Bhaskar also learnt the intricacies of Carnatic Classical music and the piano.
Vijaya Bhaskar was busy in Bombay, assisting music directors like Naushad and Madan Mohan. In Bombay Bhaskar was sitting in a restaurant in Matunga and chatting with a friend and then accidentally met B R Krishnamurthy (BRK). Bhaskar was speaking in Kannada and overheard BRK. BRK used to work as an assistant to R Nagendra Rao and had worked on several pictures with him. Bhaskar told him he was a musician. He asked him whether he would make music for a Kannada picture they were making. Bhaskar finally came down from Bombay in 1953 to do the score for film "Sri Rama Puja". He took charge and single handedly changed the face of Kannada film music. The Kannada film industry got its first original music composer.
Puttanna Kanagal who was assisting BR Pantulu, with Bellimoda became independent Director. VB was the music director for "Belli Moda". Film became an instant success and cemented their association. After "Belli Moda", there was "Gejje Pooje", and later "Naagarahaavu". He worked with Kanagal continuously till the '80s and then there was a break when M Ranga Rao took over for films like "Ranganayaki". Bhaskar came back for "Maanasa Sarovara".
He has scored music for nearly 670 movies.
Style.
Influenced by R.C. Boral and Mukul Mehta, Bhaskar developed his own style of music. He also proved that Kannada films too can have theme music. Bhaskar did not limit his musical talent for commercial movies alone. 
According to Vijaya Bhaskar folk music was the forerunner of all existing forms of music in the world. His specialty lay in the fact that he was equally comfortable using a minimum number of instruments as well as a whole orchestra. Vijaya Bhaskar's compositions are melodious and lilting. He was comfortable composing light songs as well as ghazals. He also has quite a few devotional and popular light songs to his credit. His range was extensive and included all genres of music.
He directed music for experimental movies like "Grahana", "Yellindalo Bandavaru" and "Naandi". Bhaskar is credited for inspiring producers to select popular works of Kannada poets through his music. Some of the popular numbers include "Moodana Maneya" in "Belli Moda" (poem by D. R. Bendre) and "Uttara Dhruvadim" in "Sharapanjara" (also by D. R. Bendre).
Other Languages.
Even though Vijaya Bhaskar's first composition was for a Kannada film this prolific composer has composed the music for films in Tamil Telugu Malayalam Konkani Oriya and Tulu. Apart from music composition he has also given background score for several movies. Popular Malayalam director Adoor Gopalakrishnan always preferred Bhaskar for his movies. Gopalakrishnan was very much impressed when Bhaskar gave music for his movie "Mathilukal" which had no songs at all. All in all Bhaskar gave music for three of Gopalakrishnan's films in Malayalam -- "Kathapurushan", "Vidheyan" and "Mathilukal". In Hindi Bhaskar did G. V. Iyer's "Vivekananda".
His music to Tulu language movie Koti Chennayya(1973) is very popular in Mangalore.
Bhaskar also went to London and did an English film. The film was called Robert Clive, and it was released in India also. It was shot mostly in India, and Bhaskar did a major part of the score.
Death and afterward.
Vijaya Bhaskar died on the morning of 3 March 2002 (Sunday) following a cardiac arrest at his residence in J P Nagar, Bangalore. He was 77. He left behind his wife, a son, two daughters and 5 grandchildren. Including a granddaughter who lives in Australia. His body was cremated in wilson gardens crematorium here on 5 March.

1987 Chatham Cup

The 1987 Chatham Cup was the 60th annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
Up to the last 16 of the competition, the cup was run in three regions (northern, central, and southern). National League teams received a bye until the final 32 stage. In all, 143 teams took part in the competition. Note: Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article.
The 1987 final.
As with the 1986 competition, the final was held over two legs, one at the home ground of each finalist. In all, ten goals were scored in the two matches, a record for a finals competition (though not normally considered as a record for a final, due to the two-legged nature of the tie). The two teams involved, Gisborne City and Christchurch United, also finished first and second in the year's national league, though in that competition Christchurch had the upper hand.
The first leg, held in Gisborne, was an exciting if one-sided affair, with a high standard of play. Gisborne City's first goal came in just the third minute, through Fijian player Stan Morrell. Paul Nixon was the second to get his name in the scorebook, and at the break it was 2-0. Morell got a second ten minutes after the interval, but the last 20 minutes of the match saw a flurry of goals, with Johan Verweij reducing the deficit before two late strikes from Kevin Birch and Steve Sumner stretched the Gisborne tally to five.
Christchurch had their work cut out to pull back a four-goal deficit at their home ground, and though this was never likely, the game was an enjoyable one. The score seesawed, with Gisborne twice coming back to equalise after going a goal down to the hosts. Paul Nicholls put the southerners ahead, but Sean Byrne's equaliser took the teams to the half-time break level. In the 75th minute Allan Carville doubled the Christchurch total, but a late penalty strike from Brian Strutt ensured that the second leg would finish 2–2.
The Jack Batty Memorial Trophy for player of the final was awarded to Gisborne City goalkeeper Dave Reynolds.

Abu Salabikh

The low tells at Abu Salabikh, around northwest of the site of ancient Nippur in Al-Qādisiyyah Governorate, Iraq mark the site of a small Sumerian city of the mid third millennium BCE, with cultural connections to the cities of Kish, Mari and Ebla. Its contemporary name is uncertain: perhaps this was Eresh. Kesh has also been suggested. The Euphrates was the city's highway and lifeline; when it shifted its old bed, in the middle third millennium BCE, the city dwindled away. Only eroded traces remain on the site's surface of habitation after the Early Dynastic Period of Sumer.
Archaeology.
Abu Salabikh was excavated by an American expedition from the Oriental Institute of Chicago led by Donald P. Hansen in 1963 and 1965 for a total of 8 weeks, finding around 500 tablets and fragments.

<doc id="19405079" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19405079" title="Zhu Tao">
Zhu Tao

Zhu Tao (朱滔) (died 785), formally the Prince of Tongyi (通義王), was a general of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty who initially served imperial causes during the reigns of Emperor Daizong and Emperor Dezong, but later turned against imperial rule in alliance with Wang Wujun, Tian Yue, and Li Na. Eventually, when his brother Zhu Ci rebelled at the Tang capital Chang'an and claimed imperial title, Zhu Tao became his crown prince, but after Zhu Ci was defeated and killed in 784, Zhu Tao submitted to Emperor Dezong again.
Background.
Zhu Tao was born in sometime between 744 and 748. His family was from You Prefecture (幽州, in modern Beijing). Both his great-grandfather Zhu Li (朱利) and grandfather Zhu Siming (朱思明) served as minor imperial officials. His father Zhu Huaigui (朱懷珪) served as an officer under Pei Kuan (裴寬) the military governor ("Jiedushi") of Fanyang Circuit (范陽, headquartered at You Prefecture), commanding Pei's guards, and was given a general title. Zhu Huaigui later served as a general for the rebel Yan state after An Lushan, then the military governor of Fanyang, rebelled against Emperor Xuanzong's rule in 755. At the end of the rebellion, when the Yan general then in charge of Fanyang, Li Huaixian, submitted to the rule of Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong, Emperor Daizong allowed Li Huaixian to remain military governor of the circuit, now renamed Lulong (盧龍). Li Huaixian made Zhu Huaigui the prefect of Ji Prefecture (薊州, in modern Tianjin), and Zhu Huaigui continued to serve under Li Huaixian until Zhu Huaigui's death in 766. Zhu Tao, along with his older brother Zhu Ci, both became officers under Li Huaixian as well.
Service under Zhu Xicai.
In 768, Zhu Tao and his brother Zhu Ci, as well as a colleague, Zhu Xicai, plotted to kill Li Huaixian. Under the plan, Zhu Ci and Zhu Tao arrived at Li's headquarters and killed the guards on the outside, but when Zhu Xicai did not then arrive with his troops to enter and kill Li, Zhu Ci became apprehensive and considered fleeing, staying only after Zhu Tao commented, "If our plan fails, we will die anyway. Why bother fleeing?" Zhu Xicai soon arrived, and they entered, killed Li, and slaughtered his family. Zhu Xicai claimed the title of acting military governor. The imperial government, later in the year, acquiesced and made Zhu Xicai military governor. Zhu Tao continued to serve under Zhu Xicai, and it was said that because they shared the same surname, Zhu Xicai trusted him greatly and put him in command of the headquarter guards.
Zhu Xicai, however, was said to be cruel and harsh, alienating his subordinates. In 772, Zhu Xicai's secretary Li Huaiyuan (李懷瑗), because the soldiers were angry at Zhu Xicai, assassinated him. Initially, the headquarters fell a state of confusion. Zhu Tao quickly induced his soldiers into proclaiming that the only person qualified to succeed as military governor was Zhu Ci. The other officers agreed, and Zhu Ci, who was then outside the circuit capital, was welcomed back to the capital to take over command. Zhu Ci claimed the title of acting military governor and sent messengers to the Tang capital Chang'an to report what had happened. Emperor Daizong made Zhu Ci the military governor, and Zhu Tao thereafter served under his brother.
Service under Zhu Ci.
At that time, the Tang western border was often subject to Tufan incursions, and the imperial governor regularly conscripted troops from the circuits to participate in defense in the fall – a season when Tufan often attacked. However, ever since the end of the Anshi Rebellion, Lulong Circuit had not submitted to such conscription. In 773, Zhu Ci, breaking that tradition and showing submission to the imperial government, sent Zhu Tao with 5,000 elite soldiers to Chang'an to participate in the fall defense. Emperor Daizong was very pleased, and he welcomed Zhu Tao in great feasts and gave him much reward. While he was conversing with Emperor Daizong, Emperor Daizong posed the question: "Are you or Zhu Ci more able?" Zhu Tao responded:
Emperor Daizong was pleased by the flattery.
Under Zhu Tao's subsequent suggestion – that going to Chang'an himself will show great faithfulness to the emperor – Zhu Ci himself offered to command the Lulong troops in fall defense in 774. Emperor Daizong agreed, and further built a large mansion for Zhu Ci in anticipation of his arrival. In fall 774, Zhu Ci, leaving Zhu Tao in acting command of Lulong, left Lulong and headed for Chang'an, and subsequently participated in the defense against Tufan later that year. After Zhu Ci left Lulong, however, even though he remained military governor, Zhu Tao killed a number of his close associates, and the relationship between the brothers deteriorated. Zhu Ci, believing that it would not be safe for him to return to Lulong, requested to remain at Chang'an. Emperor Daizong agreed, but let him keep the title of military governor while making Zhu Tao acting military governor, in effective control of the circuit.
As acting military governor.
By 775, one of the military governors who had only nominally been submissive to Emperor Daizong, Tian Chengsi the military governor of Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), had particularly offended not only the imperial government but also his fellow warlords — by seizing much of Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) after the death of its military governor Xue Song in 773; by looking down on Li Zhengji the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (平盧, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) and Li Baochen the military governor of Chengde (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei); and by killing Li Baochen's brother Li Baozheng (李寶正), who was also his son-in-law, after his own son Tian Wei (田維) died after colliding with Li Baozhen while playing polo. Li Baochen and Li Zhengji thus offered to attack Tian, and Emperor Daizong decided to take this opportunity to destroy the rebellious Tian. As Zhu Tao was then submissive to the imperial government, he joined forces with Li Baochen and another general loyal to the imperial government, Xue Jianxun (薛兼訓), to attack Weibo from the north, while Li Zhengji and Li Zhongchen attacked from the south. The joint forces had initial successes, but when Zhu and Li Baochen attacked Cang Prefecture (滄州, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), which was defended by Tian's cousin Tian Tingjie (田庭玠), they could not capture it quickly. Meanwhile, Tian Chengsi had persuaded Li Zhengji to withdraw with flattery. In addition, Li Baochen was offended when an imperial eunuch, Ma Chengqian (馬承倩), who had visited Li Baochen's army, was so dissatisfied with Li Baochen's gift to him that he threw it on the ground, and Tian was also able to use hoaxes to persuade Li Baochen that if he joined forces with Tian to attack Lulong, he would be successful. Li Baochen thus turned against Zhu, launching a surprise attack on him, but was unable to kill Zhu, effectively ending any hopes of the campaign against Tian and subsequently creating an enmity between the Chengde and Lulong Circuits. Emperor Daizong was subsequently forced to reaccept Tian Chengsi's nominal submission.
In 781, Li Baochen died. His son Li Weiyue requested imperial approval to succeed him. However, with Emperor Daizong having died in 779 and been succeeded by his son Emperor Dezong, Emperor Dezong, who had wanted to take a harder line with warlords, refused. Li Weiyue and his allies — Tian Chengsi's nephew Tian Yue, who had succeeded Tian Chengsi in 779; Li Zhengji (who would himself die later in 781 and be succeeded by his son Li Na, without imperial approval); and Liang Chongyi the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (山南東道, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hebei), prepared for war against the imperial government. As part of the imperial countermeasures, Emperor Dezong ordered Zhu to attack Chengde from the north. Zhu thus launched his army and headed for Yi Prefecture (易州, in modern Shijiazhuang), defended by the capable Chengde general Zhang Xiaozhong. Zhu sent his secretary Cai Xiong (蔡雄) to persuade Zhang that the imperial forces would soon be able to destroy Chengde and Weibo and that he should join the imperial cause. Zhang agreed and surrendered. Zhu then submitted a recommendation that Zhang be named the military governor of Chengde (even though most of Chengde was then still in Li Weiyue's control), and Emperor Dezong agreed. In gratitude, Zhang had his son Zhang Maohe (張茂和) marry Zhu's daughter, and Zhu Tao and Zhang Xiaozhong formed a friendship.
In spring 782, Zhu Tao and Zhang Xiaozhong captured Shulu (束鹿, in modern Shijiazhuang). Li Weiyue, in fear, considered submitting to the imperial government and giving up Chengde, but after Tian Yue found out, he angrily demanded the death of Li Weiyue's secretary Shao Zhen (邵真), who had recommended submission; Li Weiyue killed Shao and sent an army, commanded by the Weibo officer Meng You (孟祐) and his own officer Wang Wujun, to try to recapture Shulu. The joint Zhu and Zhang forces, however, defeated Li Weiyue's forces — as Wang was apprehensive that if he prevailed, Li Weiyue would be without apprehension and would kill him after his return, as Li Weiyue had also been fearful of him. Zhu wanted to continue on to the capital of Chengde, Heng Prefecture, but stopped his advances when, to his surprise, Zhang backed off and withdrew to Yifeng (義豐, in modern Baoding, Hebei). (When his subordinates questioned this move, Zhang stated his reasons — that if they pressured Heng Prefecture, the officers inside would be united to fight against the attack, while he expected that without such pressure, the officers inside would kill Li Weiyue and surrender; and that he believed Zhu to be too much of a bragger and an unreliable ally. As Zhang predicted, Wang, once he returned to Heng Prefecture, started an uprising and killed Li Weiyue and surrendered. In the aftermaths of Li Weiyue's death, Li Weiyue's brother-in-law Yang Rongguo (楊榮國), who had been defending Shen Prefecture (深州, in modern Hengshui, Hebei), surrendered to Zhu.
After the victory at Chengde, however, Emperor Dezong made a series of moves that simultaneously alienated Zhu and Wang. He refused to give Shen Prefecture to Lulong, as Zhu had requested. Rather, he divided the seven prefectures of Chengde into three smaller circuits, making Zhang the military governor of a newly created Yidingcang Circuit (易定滄, headquartered in modern Baoding, soon renamed to Yiwu (義武)), consisting of three prefectures, while giving two prefectures each to Wang and Kang Rizhi (康日知, another Chengde general who had submitted to imperial authority during the campaign), with the lesser titles of military prefect (團練使, "Tuanlianshi"). Emperor Dezong, on paper, gave Lulong two additional prefectures — De (德州, in modern Dezhou, Shandong) and Di (棣州, in modern Binzhou, Shandong) — both still then held by Li Na. Zhu was angered by Emperor Dezong's refusal to give him any part of Chengde territory (in particular, Shen Prefecture) and requiring him to capture two additional prefectures on his own, while Wang was angered that contrary to Emperor Dezong's implicit promises to give whomever killed Li Weiyue Li Weiyue's offices, he not only received a lesser title, but was in a position where he could easily be destroyed. Tian Yue, who was then still under imperial attack, thus persuaded Zhu and Wang to join him in an alliance to defend against imperial forces. Zhu and Wang both agreed, although when Zhu further tried to persuade Zhang to join the alliance as well, Zhang refused. When, in summer 784, Li Na's officer Li Shizhen (李士真) surrendered to imperial forces with De and Di Prefectures, Zhu seized Li Shizhen and the control of those two prefectures anyway, although at this point he had not made a clear break with the imperial government.
When, shortly after, Emperor Dezong issued an edict ordering that Lulong, Yidingcang, and Wang's Hengji Circuit (恆冀) attack Tian Yue from the north, Wang arrested the imperial messengers and delivered them to Zhu. Zhu thereafter declared to his subordinates that they were going to head south to attack, not to help, the imperial forces. His officers initially resisted the declaration, forcing him to postpone the action and to kill a number of them. Emperor Dezong, hearing this, tried to placate Zhu by creating him the Prince of Tongyi and exiling several officials whom Zhu had grudges against, but this did not stop Zhu's resolve. Zhu subsequently also sent secret messages to Zhu Ci, who was then defending the important border city Fengxiang (鳳翔, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), asking him to rise as well. When this was discovered, Emperor Dezong did not punish Zhu Ci but recalled him to Chang'an. Zhu Tao and Wang subsequently joined their forces and headed south, to try to save Tian Yue, then under siege by imperial forces at Weibo's capital Wei Prefecture. When they arrived at Wei Prefecture, they dealt a severe defeat to the imperial generals Ma Sui and Li Huaiguang, forcing the imperial forces to lift the siege on Wei Prefecture. Wang suggested pursuit, but Zhu, believing in Ma's subsequent message that he was willing to submit and request that Emperor Dezong grant Zhu the powers to deal with all lands north of the Yellow River, stopped the pursuit. When Ma subsequently regrouped and refused to submit, Zhu apologized to Wang, but it was said that Wang thus bore a grudge against Zhu from this point on.
In the aftermaths of the imperial forces' defeat, Tian was grateful to Zhu, and offered to subjugate himself and Wang to Zhu — in effect, offering the emperor title to Zhu. Zhu declined, crediting Wang rather than himself for the victory. At the suggestion of Zhu's staff member Li Ziqian (李子千) and Wang's staff member Zheng Ru (鄭濡), they decided to each claim a princely title to show independence from imperial authority, but keep Tang's era name in order not to completely break from Tang. On December 9, 782, in an elaborate ceremony, Zhu claimed the title of Prince of Ji; Wang claimed the title of Prince of Zhao; Tian claimed the title of Prince of Wei; and they issued a letter offering Li Na the title of Prince of Qi. They also established administrations with governmental structures paralleling the Tang imperial government to further show independence, although the titles were intentionally different than Tang's to show some subordination.
As self-proclaimed Prince of Ji.
Meanwhile, though, as Zhu Tao's and Wang Wujun's troops were continuing to battle Tang imperial troops on Tian Yue's soil, all three of them were becoming financially drained. They pinned their hopes on alliance with yet another military governor with greater pretensions – Li Xilie the military governor of Huaixi Circuit (淮西, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), whose circuit was then wealthy. They, along with Li Na, thus sent emissaries to Huaixi, suggesting to Li Xilie that he take imperial title. Li Xilie did not do so immediately, but began to claim titles greater than the ones bestowed him by Emperor Dezong. (Li Xilie would eventually declare himself to be the emperor of a new state of Chu in spring 784, although without further pledge of allegiance by the four.)
Meanwhile, in summer 783, an incident would occur to begin to erode the alliance between Zhu and Wang. The imperial general Li Sheng had wanted to cut off the supply lines between Lulong and Weibo by capturing Lulong's Zhuo (涿州, in modern Baoding) and Mo (莫州, in modern Cangzhou) Prefectures, and therefore joined forces with Zhang Xiaozhong's son Zhang Shengyun (張昇雲) in sieging Zhu's general Zhang Jingji (鄭景濟) at Qingwan (清苑, in modern Baoding). Zhu left his general Ma Shi (馬寔) at Weibo and personally relieved Qingwan, defeating Li Sheng and Zhang Shengyun and forcing them to withdraw back to Yi Prefecture, under Zhang Xiaozhong's control. Upon defeating Li Sheng and Zhang Shengyun, however, Zhu did not immediately return to Weibo, and Wang sent his subordinate Song Duan (宋端) to Zhu, urging him to return to Weibo as soon as possible. When Song met Zhu, Song was harsh in his words, and Zhu threw a fit of anger – causing Wang to be fearful and to apologize to Ma in person. Zhu's angers subsided, and it was said that he continued to treat Wang as an ally, but that Wang's secret resentment toward Zhu grew even more. Wang subsequently responded to an overture by the imperial general Li Baozhen into forming a secret alliance, although he also continued in alliance with Zhu, Tian, and Li Na.
In fall 783, soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), then at Chang'an in preparation for deployment to the Weibo front, were angry that they were not given sufficient rewards, and they mutinied, forcing Emperor Dezong to flee to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). The mutineers supported Zhu Ci — who had been forced into retirement after Zhu Tao turned against the imperial government — as their leader. Zhu Ci subsequently declared himself the emperor of a new state of Qin, and he created Zhu Tao crown prince. Zhu Tao, upon receiving the communique from Zhu Ci, immediately spread the news to the other circuits in hopes that they would declare for Zhu Ci as well. Upon news of Emperor Dezong's flight to Fengtian arriving at the imperial camp at Weibo, the imperial troops scattered, with Li Huaiguang heading for Fengtian to aid Emperor Dezong, and Ma Sui, Li Baozhen, and Li Qiu (李艽) returning to their respective circuits. Upon the imperial troops' withdrawal, Zhu Tao and Wang also withdrew to their own circuits. Meanwhile, Zhu Tao, who had earlier married a daughter of a Huige khan, requested aid from Huige. Huige sent 3,000 soldiers to aid Zhu Tao in his efforts to further advance south to capture the eastern capital Luoyang. However, by this point, Li Baozhen had persuaded Wang to turn against Zhu Tao — pointing out that if Zhu Tao and Zhu Ci were successful together, Wang would be under their control and further that Zhu's title of Prince of Ji showed implicit ambition to possess Wang's Ji Prefecture (冀州, in modern Hengshui, a different Ji Prefecture than the one that Zhu Tao's father Zhu Huaigui had been the prefect of). Emperor Dezong also sent messengers to Tian and Li Na, urging them to turn against Zhu Tao as well, and when Emperor Dezong declared a general pardon in spring 784 — the scope of which included even Zhu Tao, Wang, Tian, Li Na, and Li Xilie and implicitly promising them that if they submitted to nominal imperial authority again, he would not dare to interfere with them again — Wang, Tian, and Li Na all renounced their self-claimed royal titles.
However, Zhu Tao, unaware of this development, began his plan of march toward Luoyang in early 784. He went through Hengji and Weibo with great ceremonies of welcome from Wang and Tian. Eventually, when Zhu reached Yongji (永濟, in modern Handan) and requested that Tian join him in advancing to Luoyang, Tian refused. This drew Zhu's anger, and he divided his troops, along with Huige troops, in attacking several different Weibo cities. Tian put up his defense at Wei Prefecture, waiting for aid; while he was doing so, he was assassinated and succeeded by his cousin Tian Xu (Tian Chengsi's son), and while Zhu rejoiced at the news and Tian Xu initially made overtures to Zhu, Tian Xu eventually continued Tian Yue's policies, continuing to be allied with imperial forces under Li Baozhen and Ma Sui. Zhu thus continued to siege two primary cities of Weibo — with Zhu himself sieging Bei Prefecture (貝州, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), defended by the Weibo general Xing Caojun (邢曹俊), and Ma Shi sieging Wei Prefecture, but could not capture either. Meanwhile, Li Baozhen and Wang had joined their forces and advanced into Weibo territory. Hearing the news, Ma Shi lifted the siege on Bei Prefecture and joined forces with Zhu. When Zhu prepared to battle Wang and Li Baozhen the next day, Ma Shi, citing the fact that his soldiers at just travelled a substantial distance, requested a few days of rest. However, the Huige general assisting Zhu, as well as Yang Bu (楊布) and Cai Xiong, advocated for immediate attack. The next day, May 29, 784, the armies battled, and the overly confident Zhu was defeated by Wang's and Li Baozhen's forces. Over 10,000 of his 30,000 soldiers were killed, and over 10,000 deserted. Zhu, with a few thousand remaining soldiers, feared annihilation at Wang's and Li Baozhen's hands and fled to De Prefecture. Wang and Li Baozhen were unable to give chase because of dense fog. Zhu executed Yang and Cai and decided to return to You Prefecture, where he had left his cousin Liu Peng in charge — but as he did so, he feared that Liu would take take advantage and seize power. However, when he returned to You Prefecture, Liu mobilized the remaining troops and exited the city to welcome him in grand ceremony.
As Tang subject again.
Meanwhile, as Zhu Tao continued to be under attack by Wang Wujun (who was, briefly, given the additional title as military governor of Lulong by Emperor Dezong, whose forces had since defeated Zhu Ci and who had returned to Chang'an, in order to pressure Zhu Tao), so he sent an apologetic offer to submit to Emperor Dezong again. Emperor Dezong issued an edict accepting the resubmission and restoring his offices. He died in 785 and was given posthumous honors despite the campaigns that he had waged against the imperial government. Liu Peng succeeded him.

Here (Rascal Flatts song)

"Here" is the title of a song recorded by American country music group Rascal Flatts. It was released in September 2008 as the fifth single from their album "Still Feels Good". "Here" was co-written by Jeffrey Steele and Steve Robson, both of whom also co-wrote the group's crossover hit "What Hurts the Most" from late 2005-early 2006. Steele has also co-written several other singles for the group.
The song is part of the tracklist for Now That's What I Call Country Volume 2.
Content.
"Here" is a mid-tempo country pop ballad that describes the narrator's attempts to find "a place [he's] been looking for", which ultimately turns out to be his lover ("The place that I was trying to reach / Was you right here in front of me"). In the chorus, the narrator says that he "wouldn't change a thing" about the events that led him to her.
Reception.
Brady Vercher of The 9513 gave the song a "thumbs down" rating. He considered it a "rehash" of the group's late 2004-early 2005 single "Bless the Broken Road" (which also describes the narrator's attempt to find his love). Vercher also stated "the lyrics are really fairly bland purposefully generic so that listeners can attach meaning to the song and make it applicable to their own situation." Jim Malec, who reviewed "Still Feels Good" for the same website, also called it a "much less poignant rewrite" of "Bless the Broken Road". Stephen Thomas Erlewine, in his review of "Still Feels Good" for Allmusic, said that it "has a surging chorus ideal for both arenas and offices", and that like most of the other tracks on the album, it "settle[s into a soft mosaic of smooth pop that is as soothing as a warm bath."
Chart performance.
"Here" debuted on the Hot Country Songs chart at number 49 for the week of September 20, 2008. In its fifth week on the charts, it reached the Top 20 and made its debut on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100 at number 94. "Here" became Rascal Flatts' ninth number 1 single for the weeks of January 3, 2009-January 10, 2009.

The Waikiki Widow

"The Waikiki Widow" is an episode of the American television detective series "Hawaiian Eye".
Synopsis.
Old Tseung asks Hawaiian Eye to find out who murdered his grandson Chu. Despite a college education, Chu Tseung had worked as a houseboy for Lady Blanche Carlton, the widow of a government official in British Hong Kong, who now lives in Honolulu. Tracey Steele visits the widow and encounters three other men: the Rev Matthew Webster, tea merchant John Hunter, and ne'er-do-well Dan Gordon. All four act suspiciously, and Steele soon discovers that there is indeed "no honor among thieves".
Musical interlude.
All the Warner Brothers detective shows of the late fifties and early sixties had one or more musical interludes written into the teleplay. For this episode, Connie Stevens sang "Just For My Love" with the Shell Bar band accompanying her, while Poncie Ponce had two numbers: a short rendition of "Trade Winds", and an impersonation of Louis Armstrong singing "When My Dream Boat Comes Home".
Episode notes.
Major recurring character Lt Danny Quon is introduced in this episode, as is an occasional character, Pappa Haone. There was a significant amount of rear-projection effects throughout this episode showing actual Honolulu public exteriors, a technical process that was used sparingly for later shows in this series.

Minuscule 13

Minuscule 13 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), ε 368 (Soden), is a Greek minuscule manuscript of the New Testament, on a parchment, dated to the 13th century. The manuscript is lacunose. The text of the manuscript is important for the textual critic. It has marginalia and was adapted for liturgical use.
Description.
The codex contains the text of the four Gospels on 170 parchment leaves (), with some lacunae (Matt 1:1-2:20; 26:33-52; 27:26-28:9; Mark 1:20-45; John 16:19-17:11; 21:2-25). The text is written in two columns per page, 28-30 lines per page, in minuscule letters. According to Scrivener "it is not correctly written".
The text is divided according to the ("chapters"), whose numbers are given at the margin, and their τιτλοι ("titles of chapters") at the top of the pages. There is also another division according to the smaller Ammonian Sections (in Mark 234 sections, the last in 16:9). It has no references to the Eusebian Canons.
It contains tables of the ("tables of contents") before each Gospel, lectionary markings at the margin (for liturgical use), Synaxarion, Menologion, and subscriptions at the end of each Gospel. In subscriptions are given numbers of ρηματα, and numbers of στιχοι. According to subscriptions the Gospel of Matthew was written in Hebrew, Mark in Latin and Luke in Greek. The subscription states that Matthew was written in Hebrew eight years after our Lord’s Ascension, and contained 2522 ρηματα and 2560 στιχοι, Mark was written in Latin ten years after the Ascension with 1675 ρηματα and 1604 στιχοι, Luke in Greek fifteen years after with 3803 ρηματα and 2750 stichoi, and John thirty two years after with 1838 ρηματα.
According to Ferrar it has 1523 errors of itacisms and another errors, but not more than in other manuscripts of that time. Letter ο is frequently written for ω, ου is once written for υ (in Matthew 25:9).
The text of "Adultery pericopa" (John 7:53–8:11) follows after Luke 21:38. The text of ("signs of the times") is omitted. Luke 22:43-44 ("Christ's agony at Gethsemane") is placed after Matthew 26:39.
Text.
The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Caesarean text-type. It belongs to the textual family known as family 13, or "Ferrar group". It was confirmed by the Claremont Profile Method. According to Kurt and Barbara Aland it agrees 150 times with the Byzantine text against the original, 31 times with original against the Byzantine, and 71 it agrees with both. It has also 54 independent or distinctive readings. The Alands placed text of the codex in Category III.
The manuscripts of the "Ferrar group" were derived from an uncial ancestor once located in southern Italy (Calabria) or Sicily in the 7th century. 
In Matthew 1:16 it has the same textual reading as Codex Koridethi, the Curetonian Syriac, and rest of the manuscripts of the Ferrar Family.
In John 12:5 it reads διακοσιων for τριακοσιων along with other manuscripts of the family 13 and 1424;
History.
It is believed the manuscript was written in Calabria or Sicilia. Currently the manuscript is dated by the INTF on palaeographical grounds to the 13th century.
It was in private hands, and belonged to Archbishop of Reims Le Tellier (1671–1710) (along with codices 10, 11). It was used by Kuster in his edition of Mill's Novum Testamentum (Paris 6).
It was added to the list of the New Testament manuscripts by Wettstein, who gave it the number 13. This number is still in use.
It was examined and described by Wettstein, Griesbach, Birch, Paulin Martin, W. H. Ferrar, and J. Rendel Harris, Kirsopp Lake, and many other palaeographers and textual critics. C. R. Gregory saw the manuscript in 1884.
Griesbach highly esteemed the text of this manuscript. 
It was collated in 1868 by W. H. Ferrar, and published posthumously by T. K. Abbott in the book "A Collation of Four Important Manuscripts of the Gospels". Ferrar regarded codices 13, 69, 124, 346 as transcripts of the same archetype.
The codex is located now at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (Gr. 50) at Paris.

Kirkbean

Kirkbean is a small village and civil parish near the Solway Firth in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. , the Parish of Kirkbean - which comprises four small villages - has just 643 residents in total.
Among its most famous sons was John Paul Jones, the founder of the United States Navy, who was born in Arbigland, Kirkbean on July 6, 1747. A memorial font exists in the church, by sculptor George Henry Paulin. This illustrates USS "Bonhomme Richard". The Kirbean cemetery is the burial place of Jean Thurot (1755–1833), son of the famous Francois Thurot, French Naval Commodore and Privateer. 
Kirkbean is also the birthplace of another great seafarer, John Campbell, who was born in 1720 and who went on to become a British naval officer, navigational expert and colonial governor of Newfoundland in Canada.
The parish was also the departure point for thousands of Scots seeking a better life in the American and Australian colonies during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Convicts were also transported to Australia from here, making the parish a rich source of genealogical history with many hundreds of thousands of people worldwide having a connection to this beautiful part of Scotland.
Today, the local beaches and the bird-rich merse where millions of seabirds live or over-winter are part of the rich natural heritage of the parish. Visitors to the National Nature Reserve on the far side of the Nith come by the coachload to watch birds on the Carsethorn foreshore, before continuing to the nature reserves at Southwick and Mersehead.

Philipp Holzmann

Philipp Holzmann AG was a German construction company based in Frankfurt am Main. 
History.
Early years.
The company was founded in 1849 by Johann Philipp Holzmann (1805-1870) at Sprendlingen in present-day Dreieich near Frankfurt am Main as Philipp Holzmann & Cie. Initially, the former sawmill company was concentrating on the supply of ties for railway construction, but then began to expand into building construction and civil engineering. In 1856, the headquarters moved to Frankfurt where in the late 19th century the company experienced rapid growth. 
The first large building contract to be finished was the opera house completed in 1880, followed by the central station in Frankfurt am Main completed in 1888 and the Amsterdam Centraal railway station in 1889. Holzmann also built the original Reichstag building completed in 1894, the Hamburg city hall completed in 1897 and several railway projects in East Africa and Asia, especially the Bagdadbahn built from 1903 which incorporates the Istanbul Haydarpaşa railway station finished in 1908, as well as the Varda Viaduct at Taurus Mountains in southern Turkey completed in 1916. Furthermore, the company participated in the construction of the Elbe Tunnel of 1911 and the Hindenburgdamm completed in 1927, and also the modernist Riederwald housing estate in Frankfurt. 
In 1917, Philipp Holzmann & Cie merged with the Internationale Baugesellschaft and became the publicly traded "Philipp Holzmann Aktiengesellschaft". In 1938, the company had 20,800 employees and contributed to several major building projects like the new Reich Chancellery in Berlin, the Nazi party rally grounds in Nürnberg, the Prora complex as well as the "Westwall" and numerous sections of the "Reichsautobahn". In World War II, Holzmann constructed large parts of the Atlantic Wall by order of the Organisation Todt. 
Post-war years.
In the post-war period, the company soon recovered with the rebuilding of Frankfurt, the airport and several public infrastructure projects. Post-war projects included the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge in Venezuela completed in 1962, the AfE-Turm in Frankfurt completed in 1972, the Westend Gate in Frankfurt completed in 1976, the Eurotower in Frankfurt completed in 1977 and the Silberturm in Frankfurt completed in 1978. These projects enabled Holzmann to expand into the United States and in 1979 it acquired J.A. Jones Construction, a major US contractor.
More recent major projects involving Holzmann included the Frankfurter Büro Center in Frankfurt completed in 1980, the Eurotheum in Frankfurt completed in 1999, the Main Tower in Frankfurt completed in 2000, the Trianon in Frankfurt completed in 2003 and the Western Scheldt Tunnel in the Netherlands also completed in 2003.
Decline.
At its peak in 1994, the company had 43,000 employees and was with a revenue of 13.1 billion DM the largest German construction company. Despite public efforts for a recapitalization, the company filed for insolvency in 1999 and was finally liquidated in 2002.

National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster

The National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (National VOAD) is a coalition of the major national voluntary organizations in the United States that have made disaster-related work a priority. National VOAD member agencies provide skilled direct services along the continuum from disaster prevention and preparation to response, recovery and mitigation.
History.
National VOAD was founded in 1970 in response to the challenges many disaster organizations experienced following Hurricane Camille, which hit the Gulf Coast in August, 1969.
Prior to the founding of National VOAD, numerous organizations served disaster victims independently of one another. These included both government and the private, nonprofit sector. As a result, help came to the disaster victim haphazardly as various organizations assisted in specific ways. Unnecessary duplication of effort often occurred, while at the same time, other needs were not met. People who wanted to volunteer to help their neighbors affected by disaster were often frustrated by the variety of organizations in some areas of service and the total lack of opportunities to serve other needs. Further, there was only limited availability of training for potential volunteers. Information for victims on services during disasters was woefully inadequate. Likewise, communication among voluntary disaster agencies was very limited and coordination of services was negligible. In fact, mechanisms for this were non-existent.
The seven founding organizations met on July 15, 1970 in the American Red Cross headquarters to establish a unified response to national disasters, committing to fostering the 4Cs—communication, coordination, collaboration, and cooperation—in order to better serve people impacted by disasters. In attendance were the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Southern Baptist Convention, Mennonite Disaster Service, St. Vincent de Paul Society, Christian Reformed World Relief Committee, the National Disaster Relief Office of the Roman Catholic Church and the American Red Cross. Annual meetings were held from 1971 onwards, and National VOAD was established in 1975.
National VOAD is a leader and voice for the nonprofit organizations and volunteers that work in all phases of disaster — preparedness, response, relief, recovery, and mitigation. National VOAD is the primary point of contact for voluntary organization in the National Response Coordination Center (at Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters) and is a signatory to the National Response Plan.
Since the initial seven founding organizations convened in 1970, National VOAD's membership has grown to 110 Members total, including 55 National Member organizations and 55 State/Territory Members.
In 2010, FEMA and National VOAD signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with each other to broaden the communication and coordination between FEMA and National VOAD’s Members.

Panthera tigris sudanensis

The Panthera tigris sudanensis is a claimed subspecies of tiger, not scientifically recognised, allegedly living in Africa. It was described in 1951 by Paul E. P. Deraniyagala, based on a fur he saw on a Cairo bazaar. When he asked the seller for information, Deraniyagala was told the animal was shot in the Sudan. As Mazák wrote in 1980, it was either a joke or the seller felt obliged to be polite and answer any question, whether with truth or an invention. Deraniyagala took a picture of the specimen's fur, which, when published, made the scientists say, according to the pattern of stripes, it was most likely a fur of the Caspian tiger ("Panthera tigris virgata") and the fur must have been smuggled from Iran or Turkey. At that time, the Caspian tiger was nearly extinct. If a photo were enough for a scientific description, "Panthera tigris sudanensis" would now be one of the Caspian tiger synonyms; as Mazák wrote, "the situation is half-humorous, half-ironic."

Arthur Böttcher

Jakob Ernst Arthur Böttcher (July 13, 1831 – August 10, 1889) was a Baltic German pathologist and anatomist who was a native of Bauska, in what was then the Courland Governorate (present-day Latvia). He worked primarily within the Russian Empire.
In 1856 he earned his medical doctorate from the University of Dorpat (present-day University of Tartu in Estonia) with a dissertation on the nerve supply to the inner ear's cochlea. He furthered his studies with journeys to Germany, France and Austria, and in 1862 he became a full professor of general pathology and pathological anatomy at Dorpat. From 1871 to 1877 he was editor of the magazine "Dorpater Medicinische Zeitschrift".
Böttcher is largely known for his anatomical investigations of the inner ear, particularly studies involving the structure of the reticular lamina and nerve fibers of the organ of Corti. Today his name is associated with the eponymous "Bottcher cells", which are cells of the basilar membrane of the cochlea. Other anatomical terms that contain his name are:

Abdul Basit () is a male Muslim given name. It is built from the Arabic words "Abd", "al-" and "Basit". The name means "servant of the Expander", "Al-Bāsit" being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names.
The letter "a" of the "al-" is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by "u". So the first part can appear as Abdel, Abdul or Abd-al. The second part may appear as Basit, Basith, Basset or in other ways. The whole name is subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.

Ulrich Schmidl

Ulrich Schmidl or Schmidel (1510 in Straubing - 1579 in Regensburg) was a German Landsknecht, conquistador, explorer, chronicler and councilman. Schmidl was, beside Hans Staden, one of the few the Landsknechts, who wrote his experiences down.
Biography.
Schmidl was the son of a wealthy merchant, and received a good education. He entered military service and took part 1534 as a Landsknecht under Pedro de Mendoza in an expedition to today's Argentina (Río de la Plata). He also accompanied Juan de Ayolas on his first trip in quest of provisions, and afterward went with Ayolas in his expedition up Paraguay River, and was one of the soldiers that were left with Domingo Irala in charge of the vessels in the port of Candelaria. When Cabeza de Vaca was deposed in April 1544, Schmidel sustained Irala, who was the new governor, and in 1546 accompanied him in his expedition to Peru as far as the foot of the Andes, where he was despatched with Nuño de Chaves to President La Gasca. He accompanied Irala on his last unfortunate expedition of 1550.
He became a founder of Buenos Aires. His journey led him across the Río Paraná and Río Paraguay and into today's Paraguay, where he helped to found Asunción. From there he undertook several expeditions in the Gran Chaco, which led him into southeast Bolivia.
In 1552, on learning of the death of his elder brother to whose estate he was to succeed, Schmidel obtained his discharge. In Seville, he presented to the council of the Indies letters from Irala with the report of his discoveries, and arrived toward the close of 1554 in Straubing, where he afterward resided. He had kept a diary during his wanderings, and wrote a narrative of his adventures under the title of "Wahre Geschichte einer merkwürdigen Reise, gemacht durch Ulrich Schmidel von Straubingen, in America oder der Neuen Welt, von 1534 bis 1554, wo man findet alle seine Leiden in 19 Jahren, und die Beschreibung der Länder und merkwürdigen Völker die er gesehen, von ihm selbst geschrieben" (The true story of a noteworthy trip made by Ulrich Schmidel von Straubingen in America or the New World from 1534 to 1554, where will be found all his troubles of 19 years and the description of lands and noteworthy peoples he saw, described by himself; Frankfort, 1557), of which a Latin version appeared in Nuremberg in 1599 as "Vera historia", etc. Henri Ternaux-Compans published a translation of the work in his "Voyages, relations et mémoires originaux pour servir à l'histoire de la découverte de l'Amérique, recueil de documents sur la Floride" (20 vol., 1837-1841) and Andrés González de Barcia in his "Historiadores primitivos de Indias". Schmidel thus became the first historian of Argentina.
Much of his account in the German language overlaps with an account written in Spanish by Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, who was "adelantado" of the Governorate of the Río de la Plata between 1540 and 1545. Their accounts, one by a German mercenary, another by a Spanish nobleman, offer stark differences in point-of-view.
His narrative gives the names and tells of the habits and manner of living of many Indian nations that were extinct a century later. Perhaps the most fascinating parts of his accounts are those that attribute cannibalism not to the South American natives, but rather to the desperate conquistadors who were unsuited for survival in the rough climate, and would frequently consume one another in an effort to escape starvation. A particularly notable account states that Spaniards who were hung, and while barely dead, were hacked up by their fellow countrymen, and devoured.
After his return to Straubing with a few pieces of booty, he inherited the fortune of his deceased brother, and became a councilman. Because of religious strife he had to leave Straubing and went in 1562 to Regensburg, where he died around 1579.

Tuck Turner

George A. "Tuck" Turner (February 13, 1866 – July 16, 1945) was a 19th-century Major League Baseball player for the Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Browns.
Career.
Born in West New Brighton, New York, "Tuck" broke into the National League with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1893 at the age of 20. In reality he was 26, being born in 1866, but as was a common practice in baseball at the time, Turner told everyone he was younger than he really was. In 1894, Turner was part of one of the great hitting outfields in baseball history with Billy Hamilton, Sam Thompson, Ed Delahanty, and Turner all hitting over .400 for the year. Turner finished second that season with a .418 batting average to Hugh Duffy, who also happened to set the single-season batting average record of .440. For those Phillies teams though, a pennant wasn't to be as the late 1890s were the peak of the powerful Original Baltimore Orioles and Boston Beaneaters.
Turner's best seasons were 1894 and 1895, with Tuck leading the league in hitting with a .411 batting average through August 1895. By the tail end of 1895 and the beginning of 1896, Turner had lost his batting touch and so was traded to St. Louis for Duff Cooley. According to accounts in the defunct sports journal, The Sporting Life, Turner contracted malaria with recurrent attacks in 1897 and 1898. This is in response to what happened to cause this promising major leaguer to suddenly lose his touch with the bat.
On October 3, 1897 while playing for St. Louis, Turner accomplished a rare feat by hitting an inside-the-park grand slam. Turner's .418 batting average in 1894 is ninth all-time for single-season MLB batting average and also the highest in a single season for a switch hitter.
Before reaching the majors, Turner was a paid player in the Buffalo Amateur Baseball League of the Amateur Athletic Union. From 1899 to 1901, Turner played with the Hartford Indians in the Eastern League, replacing legendary Louis Sockalexis in the field his first season. Turner's post-majors career included stops in the Western League, Connecticut League and New England League.
Turner grew up in West New Brighton with Jack Taylor, a solid pitcher for the Phillies in the mid-1890s, Jack Sharrott, George Sharrott and Jack Cronin. All would go on to careers in the National League.
Turner was inducted into the Staten Island Sports Hall Of Fame in 2011. His award was accepted for him by his grandson, Richard Turner.

<doc id="19405868" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19405868" title="Westphalian Dachsbracke">
Westphalian Dachsbracke

The Westphalian Dachsbracke (FCI No. 100) is a small, short legged scenthound, a breed of dog originating in Westphalia, a region of Germany. The Westphalian Dachsbracke was used in Sweden to develop the Drever.
Appearance.
The Westphalian Dachsbracke (Westfälische Dachsbracke) is a smaller, short legged version of the Deutsche Bracke, and very similar in size and appearance to the Drever (FCI No. 130), but 2 cm shorter (the Drever was first registered in Sweden in 1910 as the Westfälische Dachsbracke; the name was changed in 1947.)
The Westphalian Dachsbracke stands about 30 to 38 cm (12 to 15 ins) high at the withers. It has medium long drop ears, short legs, and a long tail which is set high and carried up. The coat has short fur, usually tricolor (red to yellow with a black saddle), with white markings called Bracken marks - a white muzzle, chest, legs, collar, and tip of the tail, and a blaze on the head. The chest is more narrow than the Dachshund's chest, and the legs are longer.
History.
Dogs of similar type are seen in very old European paintings, though the Westphalian Dachsbracke was first described as a variety of German Hound in 1886. It was recognized by the Verband für das Deutsche Hundewesen (German Kennel Club) in 1935 with its current name, and by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale as breed number 100 in Group 6 (Scenthounds), Section 1.3 (Small hounds). The Westphalian Dachsbracke is the ancestor breed of the Swedish scenthound, the Drever. Of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, only the United Kennel Club in the US recognises the Westphalian Dachsbracke, in its Scenthound Group. The Westphalian Dachsbracke also may be recognised by any of the many minor registries, rare breed groups, hunting clubs, and internet dog registry businesses under its original name or varriations on the name. Hunting use of the Westphalian Dachsbracke has been mostly supplanted by the Drever, and the Westphalian Dachsbracke is seldom seen even in its home country; purchasers of dogs represented as Westphalian Dachsbracke should research the dog's background, especially if it is registered with one of the minor clubs that require little to no documentation before accepting a dog or litter for registration.
Names and etymology.
"Dachs" is German for badger, a term used for hunting dogs with short legs. The name "Dachsbrache" may reflect that the Dachsbrache dogs were bred down in size by crossbreeding long-legged Bracken with the Dachshund. Historically, the term Bracke was used in German to mean the scenthounds. "Brack" is an old Low German word for a coastal marsh periodically inundated by storm surges with salt water-the English word "brackish". In Europe, scenthounds are usually separated into running hounds (free running packs, which either drive the game back to the hunter, or the hunter follows as they run, or the hunter waits until the dogs' cries communicate that game has been found and held, and then goes to that spot) or leash hounds (which follow the game or track wounded or dead game while being held on a leash by the hunter.) The Bracke are usually used as running hounds, in packs, to hunt rabbits or foxes in a type of hunt called "Brackade". The Dachsbrache are used for hunting today mainly in Scandinavia and in alpine regions.
The Deutsche Bracke (German Bracke, also called the German Hound, Fédération Cynologique Internationale breed number 299) is another breed of Bracke, the first one registered as a separate breed, in 1900. The Alpenländische Dachsbracke (Alpine Dachsbracke, breed number 254) is from Tyrol, in Austria. The Drever, breed number 130, is also called the "Swedish Dachsbracke".

<doc id="19405885" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19405885" title="The Two-Character Play">
The Two-Character Play

The Two Character Play, also known as "Out Cry" in one of its alternate versions, is a play by Tennessee Williams written 25 years after his famous "A Streetcar Named Desire". It was one of his most personal works; Williams spent almost ten years writing and rewriting it.
Background.
After winning critical and popular acclaim with his earlier plays, Williams wanted to experiment and expand his writing style. His later creations had more in common with playwrights Samuel Beckett and the emerging Harold Pinter, than with the name that Tennessee Williams had come to signify. Although the play is a marked departure from the naturalism of his classics, familiar themes permeate. Confinement due to mental illness, repression leading to social isolation and the tyranny and claustrophobia that comes from impinging on one another’s psychological and physical space, are all present in "The Two-Character Play".
When the play premiered in its various forms, it was not well received by critics or audiences. At the time many audiences attended the theatre as a form of escapism. "The Two-Character Play" was the exact opposite. Clare and Felice, the actors, as well as the characters they play, cannot, no matter how hard they try to delude themselves, escape from the reality of their deteriorating mental states. Consequently, the viewers themselves are confronted with the darker truths of what it is to be human.
It was very experimental for its time. The language is heightened. There are slabs of verbosity juxtaposed with pauses and stunted sentences.
"The Two-Character Play" is partially autobiographical. The actor Clare and especially the character Clare, are loosely based on Williams’ sister Rose, and the actor Felice and the character Felice, on Williams himself. The "confining nature of human existence" was a major theme throughout his work and this play is seen to be his most personal interpretation.
It took Williams over ten years to write "The Two-Character Play", longer than any other play, and illustrates an innovation in his writing style.
Plot.
The characters in this play, Felice and Clare, are two actors on tour; they are also brother and sister. They find themselves deserted by their acting troupe in a decrepit "state theatre in an unknown state". Faced (perhaps) by an audience expecting a performance, they enact "The Two-Character Play" – an illusion within an illusion, an 'out cry' from isolation, panic, and fear. ("Out Cry" was the title of one version of this play, which premiered at the Ivanhoe Theatre in Chicago in July 1971. "Out Cry" later premiered on Broadway, directed by Peter Glenville and co-starring Michael York and Cara Duff-MacCormick, and which ran from March 1–10, 1973 at the Lyceum Theater after one preview on February 28.)
The plot is confusing and difficult to follow, with little sense of a resolution. "The Two-Character Play" has a concurrent double plot with the convention of a play within a play scenario. The characters of Clare and Felice are psychologically damaged from witnessing the traumatic murder/suicide of their parents. They have remained recluses in the family home since the incident and are attempting to make hesitant contact with the outside world. As the actors dip in and out of performance, improvising parts not memorised or not yet written, it becomes increasingly difficult to differentiate the actors from the characters and reality from illusion.
Performances.
The play itself is rarely performed. A 30th Anniversary production was staged in Australia in 2005 at the University of Melbourne with siblings Stephen Ryan and Sarah Ryan playing the roles of Felice and Clare. For his performance as Felice, Stephen Ryan won the Murray Sutherland Prize for the most outstanding performance in a dramatic production at the University of Melbourne. San Francisco's Theatre Rhinoceros staged the show in January 2012.
The play was produced at London's Jermyn Street Theatre in October 2010. The production starred Catherine Cusack and Paul McEwan, and was directed by the then-Artistic Director of the theater, Gene David Kirk. 
In May, 2011, Off-Broadway's Classic Stage Company (CSC) presented a one-night-only staged reading with Tony Award winner Alan Cumming and Tony nominee Jessica Hecht.
"The Two-Character Play" opened Off Broadway on June 19, 2013 at New World Stages. The production starred Tony Award winner Amanda Plummer and Oscar Nominee Brad Dourif. Directed by Gene David Kirk
The play was produced as a senior directorial at The College of William and Mary in October 2013. 
In that same month, it will also be produced by Spooky Action Theater - website in Washington, D.C. It will run from Oct. 3 to Oct. 27, 2013 and will star David Bryan Jackson and Helen Hayes Award winner Lee Mikeska Gardner, directed by Richard Henrich.

Altiatlasius

Altiatlasius is potentially the oldest known "euprimate" (primate of modern aspect), dating to the Late Paleocene from Morocco. The only species, Altiatlasius koulchii, was described in 1990.
Its true taxonomic position remains controversial. It has also been suggested that it should be classified as a plesiadapiform (an extinct group of arboreal mammal thought to be closely related to primates) or that it should be recognized as a euprimate, either as an omomyid (a branch of fossil primates thought to be closely related to tarsiers), an early tarsiiform, or the oldest stem simian (monkeys and apes).
Evolutionary history and taxonomy.
"Altiatlasius koulchii", potentially the oldest known euprimate, is known only from ten isolated upper and lower molars and a fragment of a mandible. These fossils date to the Late Paleocene, approximately 57 million years ago, and come from the Jbel Guersif Formation in the Ouarzazate Basin of Morocco. First described in 1990 by Sigé "et al.", "Altiatlasius" was originally proposed to be an omomyid, possibly close to the split with simians (monkeys and apes). It has also been classified in the family Toliapinidae, a type of plesiadapiform found in Europe. Other classifications assume they are stem euprimates, eosimiid-like simians, or an early tarsiiform. Many authorities consider "Altiatlasius" to be the oldest stem simian.
Together with the Early to Middle Eocene fossil primate "Algeripithecus" (originally thought to be the oldest crown simian) from Algeria, "Altiatlasius" helped strengthen the argument for an African origin of simian primates. However, when additional fossil remains of "Algeripithecus" were found, it was shown to be a strepsirrhine primate instead of a haplorhine, placing it with the azibiids, a group thought to be most closely related to lemuriforms (living lemurs and lorisoids). Because "Algeripithecus" was radically reclassified with the discovery of more fossils, equally fragmentary remains of "Altiatlasius" leave its phylogenetic affinities questionable. Also, the 20 million year gap in the fossil record between "Altiatlasius" and the first parapithecoids raises questions about the validity of the African origins hypothesis for simians.

List of New York Yankees Opening Day starting pitchers

The New York Yankees are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in The Bronx, New York City, New York. They play in the American League East division. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Yankees have used 57 different Opening Day starting pitchers in their 110 seasons. Since the franchise's beginning in , the 58 starters have a combined Opening Day record of 57 wins, 36 losses, 1 tie (57–36–1), and 17 no decisions. No decisions are only awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game. Although in modern baseball, ties are rare due to extra innings, in 1910, New York's Opening Game against the Boston Red Sox was declared a tie due to darkness – at the time, Hilltop Park had lacked adequate lighting.
Whitey Ford, Ron Guidry, and Mel Stottlemyre hold the Yankees record for most Opening Day starts with seven. The other pitchers with three or more Opening Day starts for New York are Lefty Gomez (6), Red Ruffing (5), Jack Chesbro (4), Roger Clemens (4), Bob Shawkey (4), Ray Caldwell (3), Jimmy Key (3), Vic Raschi (3), and most recently CC Sabathia (4). Jimmy Key holds the Yankee record for best Opening Day record with a perfect 3–0.
On Opening Day, Yankee pitchers have a combined record of 35–12–1 when playing at home. Of those games, pitchers have a 1–0 record at Oriole Park, a 3–1–1 record at Hilltop Park, a 2–3 record from Polo Grounds, a 28–8 record at Yankee Stadium, and a 1–0 record at Shea Stadium. When on the road for Opening Day, Yankee pitchers have a combined record of 27–26.
During the and seasons, the franchise played in Baltimore as the "Baltimore Orioles". The franchise has Opening Day record of 1–1 as Baltimore. After their move to New York in , the franchise was known as the New York Highlanders until . As the Highlanders, they had a 6–3–1 Opening Day record. For seasons in which New York would later win the World Series, the starting pitchers have a 16–8 record.

Myna Potts

Myna Gayle Hicks Potts (born March 30, 1927) is an historical preservationist from Chillicothe in Hardeman County in West Texas who is the curator of the Medicine Mound Museum in the nearby ghost town of Medicine Mound. Only two buildings remain in the town. Medicine Mound has received non-profit status and has been placed in the domain of the newly established Downtown Medicine Mound Preservation Group, a 501(c)(3) public charity. 
Medicine Mounds.
Medicine Mound is near four dolomite hills known as Medicine Mounds, which are considered sacred by the Comanche and Kiowa Indians who believe that the landmarks contain mystical spirits to improve the quality of their lives. The mounds are on private property and not available for public tours beyond an outer five-mile limit. One can see for approximately fifty miles from the top of the mounds.
John A. Bates of Ferndale in Oakland County, Michigan, near Detroit, the former executive director of the Downtown Medicine Mound Preservation Group and a cousin of Myna Potts, recalls having visited the ghost town when he was a boy: "The Comanche would come to the Medicine Mounds for their healing powers, often trading flint and other goods and racing their ponies around the mound below us. . . . We carefully descended about seventy-five feet or so to an almost imperceptible track that circled the entire mound, which was used by Quanah Parker's braves to test their horsemanship. 1966, this 'track' was still quite visible, especially for a young man with a fertile imagination. Sadly, it is slowly disappearing as the young cedar trees begin to reclaim the ground."
The four mounds, which range in elevation from two hundred to five hundred feet, were Comanche campsites and ceremonial grounds. The mounds had abundant spring water which encouraged hunting, the gathering of medicinal plants, and for worship. The Comanche Nation still considers two of these mounds to be sacred: the tallest, Medicine Mound, and the second tallest, Cedar Mound. The Indians return to these sites to gather plants and herbs and to seek spiritual guidance.
Early years and family.
Potts was the only daughter of five children of Ira Lee Hicks (1886–1966) and the former Lillie Bell Holmes (1892–1989), who are buried in Chillicothe. She was born in Bonita, an unincorporated community in Montague County northwest of Denton. The Pottses moved west of Wichita Falls to Medicine Mound in Hardeman County when Myna was still an infant. Ira Hicks and his brother-in-law, Lon Cobb (died 1942), operated the Hicks-Cobb General Store, since the museum which Potts oversees as the major focus of her historical preservation efforts. 
Potts attended elementary school in Medicine Mound and graduated from Quanah High School in Quanah, the seat of Hardeman County, named for the Comanche chief Quanah Parker. She attended Texas Tech University in Lubbock for one year. Potts was married to John Luther Potts, Jr. (1922-2011), who retired from the Lykes Shipping Company of New Orleans. As a skipper in the merchant marine, he was away from home in Chillicothe six months at a time, a situation which led Mrs. Potts to master the ham radio to maintain communication with her husband. The couple had one son, David Lee Potts (born January 12, 1947).
Historic preservation.
Potts grew up in the store, which she still describes as her "playhouse". In addition to the Hicks-Cobb General Store, Medicine Mound in its heyday had the W.W. Cole Building, a combination bank, drugstore, gasoline station (with rusty pumps remaining), and post office, a laundry (specifically, New York Steam Laundry), a school, and a church. U.S. Highway 287 bypassed Medicine Mound in the late 1920s, and the community slowly declined in population. The ghost town is located at the junction of Texas Farm or Ranch Roads 91 and 1167, which can be reached from U.S. 287 southward at Chillicothe or several miles further west of Chillicothe. It is southeast of the county seat of Quanah. 
Cotton was grown about Medicine Mound, and times were generally prosperous until the Great Depression. A fire swept through Medicine Mound in 1933, but the community rebuilt. Though the original town buildings were wooden, solid granite round rocks were placed on the revised structures—the stone is really prehistoric gravel and was brought from the Wichita Mountains of Oklahoma,
The population steadily declined from some five hundred to nothing, meaning a ghost town, though the 2000 census placed the count at fifty, most living away from the town itself. When Hicks-Cobb closed in 1966, the town died. There are four Texas Historical Commission markers outside the old store dedicated to (1) the community of Medicine Mound, (2) the Hicks-Cobb store, turned into a museum by Potts, (3) a Works Progress Administration sanitation project from the 1930s, and (4) a pioneer cemetery south of Medicine Mound, which is believed to have a total of nine graves.
On April 5, 2008, Potts addressed the West Texas Historical Association annual meeting in Canyon south of Amarillo on her historical preservation work and her attempt to highlight the contributions of rural Americans.
"Texas Country Reporter".
In 2007, Potts told Bob Phillips in his "Texas Country Reporter" syndicated television series that Medicine Mound "was rural America, and it was complete. We had everything we needed right here. . . . I want the people remembered who settled the area. . . . place has meaning; they had a place in history." 
Phillips narrated his observations as follows: is one woman determined to keep this town's history together. . . . We found Medicine Mound on Highway 1167 far from anything but the hills that the native Comanche held sacred, the mounds that give this place its name. Once we were here, we felt close to those who built the community, and the past didn't seem so far away."
Museum access.
The museum is particularly known for its extensive collection of hundreds of photographs of early pioneers as well as old bottles, store fixtures, and a variety of items once sold in the mercantile, such as hats. Potts began assembling the pictures when she worked with western author Bill Neal, who wrote on a book on the region, "Our Stories, Legends of the Mounds".
Museum hours are usually 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday but also by appointment. In many ways, Medicine Mound Museum is Potts' "personal museum", the story of her own life. There is a highway rest stop on U.S. 287 to assist travelers desiring to detour to Medicine Mound to see the four mounds, the historical museum, and the ghost town.
Photographer Joe Miller recommends a visit to Medicine Mound for those who like solitude: "Potts is a gracious hostess and the place is certainly worth a visit. I love places like Medicine Mound because I hate crowds -- especially when I'm trying to do photography. I set up my heavy tripod in the middle of the street knowing that there probably wouldn't be any traffic and, if someone did come along they would most likely pull around me and wave like they do when you meet them on the highway. There's not a lot of road rage in Medicine Mound."

Marc Verica

Marc Verica (born March 26, 1988 in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania) is an American football quarterback who is currently a free agent. He was signed by the Washington Redskins as an undrafted free agent in 2011, out of the University of Virginia. Currently he just signed to play for the Cougars de Saint-Ouen l'Aumône, France for 2012 season.
Early years.
Marc Verica attended Monsignor Bonner High School in Drexel Hill, a suburb of Philadelphia. As a senior he completed 81 of 160 passes for 899 yards and three touchdowns in nine games; he missed two games due to an injury and his team lost both. As a junior, he completed 112 passes in 222 attempts for 1,545 yards and eight touchdowns. Verica was named to league, county, and city all-star teams as a junior. His position coach in high school previously had coached former Cavalier quarterback Matt Schaub. In addition to Virginia, Verica was offered a scholarship by Wisconsin.
College.
Verica was a redshirt as a true freshman in 2006. He also did not play as a redshirt freshman in the 2007 season when he was behind starter Jameel Sewell and backup Peter Lalich. Prior to the 2008 season, Verica competed with Lalich and fifth year senior Scott Deke for the starting quarterback job after Sewell became academically ineligible. Verica lost the competition to Lalich but beat out Deke for the backup position.
Verica saw his first action in college late in the game against the Southern California Trojans in the Cavaliers' first game of the 2008 season. Verica did not play in the next game against the Richmond Spiders.
On September 10, 2008 it was announced through a statement from Virginia's sports information office that Lalich would not be starting in the September 13 game against the University of Connecticut. Marc Verica made his debut as starter in a game the Cavaliers lost 45-10. He completed 22 of 30 passes for 158 yards with no touchdowns and one interception before being relieved by Deke in the fourth quarter. When Lalich was dismissed from the football team the following week, Verica became the starting quarterback. Verica led the Cavaliers to four straight wins during October and catapulted the Cavaliers into first place in the ACC Coastal Division. However, in November, the Cavaliers lost all four of their games to finish the season 5-7. In the season finale against Virginia Tech, cornerback Vic Hall moved to quarterback for most snaps as the Cavaliers employed the wildcat formation though Verica returned for downs requiring a pass. 
Verica competed with Sewell and Hall for the starting quarterback position in 2009, however Sewell emerged as the primary starter. Verica received playing time in several games and started against Miami when Sewell sat out due to injury. 
Verica competed with redshirt freshman Ross Metheny for the starting quarterback position in the 2010 season, ultimately winning. Verica led the cavs to a 4-8 record, starting all 12 games. Metheny and true freshman Michael Rocco received limited playing time in relief of Verica during the 2010 season.
Cougars.
In 2011, Marc signed with the Cougars de Saint-Ouen l'Aumône, France. The Cougars play in the highest level of competition in France (Division 1).

Oskanondonha

Oskanondonha (1710-1816) was an Oneida "pine tree chief". He was born an Iroquoian-speaking "Susquehannock" (also called Conestoga) but was adopted into the Oneida people. Alternate spellings for his name include "Skenando", "Skenandoa", "Skonondon", and "Shenandoah." When he accepted Christianity, he was baptized as John. 
During the colonial years, he supported the English against the French in the Seven Years War. Later, during the American Revolutionary War, he supported the colonials and led a force of 250 Oneida and Tuscarora warriors in western New York in their support. A longtime friend of the minister Samuel Kirkland, a founder of Hamilton College, his request to be buried next to him was granted. In the procession at the funeral of "Skenando" were Oneida, students and officers from Hamilton College, Mrs. Kirkland and her family, and many citizens of Clinton, New York.
Life.
During the Seven Years War (also called the French and Indian War in the United States), the chief "Skenando" favored the British against the French and led the Oneida in their support. He was said to have saved colonists in German Flatts from a massacre. During the next decades, he formed more alliances with the ethnic German and British colonists in central and western New York. He was notable for his height, estimated to be 6'5" and was said to have a commanding presence. 
Samuel Kirkland, a missionary minister who first went to the Iroquois country of western New York in 1764, encountered Chief "Skenando" there and mentioned him in letters. Kirkland returned to the area in 1766 and worked with the Oneida for the remainder of his life. After Kirkland persuaded the chief to become baptized, "Skenando" took the name "John". Many of the Oneida converted to Christianity before the American Revolutionary War.
In part due to his friendship with Kirkland, Chief "Skenando" favored the colonials and led the Oneida to be their allies during the Revolutionary War. He led many Oneida to fight against the British and their Iroquois allies from four nations of the Confederacy. He commanded 250 warriors from the Oneida and Tuscarora tribes. Today the silver pipe given to him in appreciation in the 1800s by New York Governor Daniel D. Tompkins is displayed at "Shako:wi", the Oneida Nation museum at their reservation near Syracuse.
Together with their warriors fighting against the British and allies from Pennsylvania to the Canadian border, the Oneida oral tradition tells that Chief "Skenando" provided critical food to General George Washington and his men during their harsh winter at Valley Forge in 1777-1778 by sending them corn. Washington is said to have named the Shenandoah River and valley in his honor. In addition, Polly Cooper, an Oneida woman, aided the troops by teaching them how to cook corn properly and care for the sick. Washington gave her a shawl in thanks, which is displayed at "Shako:wi". 
"Skenando" was the father-in-law of the Mohawk war leader Joseph Brant, who allied with the British during the revolution. Brant had "Skenando" jailed at Fort Niagara in 1779 during the war when the Oneida was on a peace mission to the Iroquois. "Skenando" or "Shenandoah" is claimed as an ancestor by the Oneida singer Joanne Shenandoah.
After the war, Kirkland continued to be involved with the Oneida. About 1791 he started planning a seminary, a boys' school to be open to Oneida as well as European-American young men of the area. In 1793 he received a charter from the state for the Hamilton Oneida Seminary, and in 1794 completed its first building, known as Oneida Hall. By 1812, the seminary developed into the four-year institution known as Hamilton College. 
Upon the death of "Skenando", at his wish (and with the Kirkland family's approval) he was buried beside his friend (who had died in 1808) on the grounds of Kirkland's home in Clinton, New York. Today the property is known as Harding Farm. As a measure of the respect for the chief, the procession at his funeral in 1816 included his one surviving son and other Oneida people, students and officers from Hamilton College, the widow Mrs. Kirkland and other members of her family, and numerous citizens. In 1851, both bodies were reinterred in the cemetery of Hamilton College, of which Kirkland was a co-founder.

Cubic mile of oil

The cubic mile of oil (CMO) is a unit of energy. It was created by Hew Crane of SRI International to aid in public understanding of global-scale energy consumption and resources.
Significant sources of energy include oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, and biomass (primarily the burning of wood). Other energy sources include geothermal, wind, photovoltaic, and solar thermal. The various energy units commonly used to measure these sources (e.g., joules, BTUs, kilowatt hours, therms) are only somewhat familiar to the general public, and their relationships can be confusing. These common energy units are sized for everyday activities (a joule is the energy required to lift a small apple one metre vertically). For regional, national, and global scales, larger energy units, such as the exajoule, the billion barrels of oil equivalent (BBOE) and the quad are used. Derived by multiplying the small common units by large powers of ten these larger units pose additional conceptual difficulties for many citizens.
Crane intended the cubic mile of oil to provide a visualizable scale for comparing the contributions of these diverse energy components as a percentage of total worldwide, energy use.
The global economy consumes approximately 30 billion barrels of oil (1.26 trillion U.S. gallons or 4.75 trillion ltrs ) each year. Numbers of this magnitude are difficult to conceive by most people. The volume occupied by one trillion U.S. gallons is about one cubic mile. Crane felt that a cubic mile would be an easier concept for the general public than a trillion gallons.
Definition and energy equivalents.
The CMO is the energy released by burning a cubic mile of oil. Conversions to other units may be calculated based on the barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), an approximation of the energy released by burning one 42-US-gallon barrel of crude oil. Since one BOE is about and one cubic mile is about :
Annual energy consumption by source.
The world consumes approximately 3 CMO annually from all sources. The table
Global energy reserves.
Proved oil reserves are those that can be extracted with reasonable certainty under existing conditions using existing technology. Global proved oil reserves are estimated at approximately . This corresponds to roughly 43 cubic miles, or 43 CMO. At the current rate of use, this would last about 40 years. Technological advances, new discoveries, and political changes will likely lead to additional proved oil reserves in the future. Concurrently, the International Energy Agency predicted in its 2005 World Energy Outlook that the annual consumption will increase by 50% by 2030. Coal and natural gas currently provide 1.42 CMO of energy per year. Global reserves of these fossil resources are as follows:
Replacement of oil by alternative sources.
While oil has many other important uses (lubrication, plastics, roadways, roofing) this section considers only its use as an energy source.
The CMO is a powerful means of understanding the difficulty of replacing oil energy by other sources. SRI International chemist Ripudaman Malhotra, working with Crane and colleague Ed Kinderman, used it to describe the looming energy crisis in sobering terms. Malhotra illustrates the problem of producing one CMO energy that we currently derive from oil each year from five different alternative sources. Installing capacity to produce 1 CMO per year requires long and significant development.
Allowing fifty years to develop the requisite capacity, 1 CMO of energy per year could be produced by any one of these developments:
The energy produced is the power rating of the source multiplied by the duration it is operational. These comparisons take into account the variability of available power (solar panels work only during the day, turbines work only when the wind blows). Also, whereas 1 kWh is equivalent to 3412 BTU of primary energy, in practice it takes closer to 10,000 BTU to produce 1 kWh of electricity from coal and other fossil sources. Thus, when considering sources such as wind and solar which directly produce electricity, the required installed capacity was calculated by using 1 kWh as equivalent to 10,000 BTU.
The environmental, social, and financial costs of such development projects are immense:
For comparison, US$3.2 trillion is the approximate gross domestic product of Germany, China, or the United Kingdom. The total land area of New Zealand is approximately .
At a 2008 market price of US$120 per barrel (US$750/m3), the cost of one CMO was about US$3 trillion.

The Navigator (1801 guide book)

The Navigator, written by Zadok Cramer and first published in 1801, was a guide for settlers and travelers moving westward into or through the interior of the United States during the first half of the 19th century. 
Its subject matter is described on its title page:
Cramer enlarged, corrected and expanded it through 12 editions in 25 years. Though priced at one dollar it was very popular. 
The eighth edition was published in 1814, contained 369 pages, as well as dozens of maps detailing the navigable waterways and all their hazards.

"Johanna's Law," also known as the Gynecologic Cancer Education and Awareness Act, promotes the education of women to increase awareness of ovarian cancer, its risk factors and symptoms. Often, ovarian cancer is far advanced before detection. Increased awareness could lead to earlier detection and reduced morbidity, and could save lives. 
Senators Arlen Specter and Tom Harkin introduced the Bill in the Senate on June 6, 2005. Senator Barack Obama co-sponored it. It passed both Houses of Congress unanimously and was signed into law on January 12, 2007 by George W. Bush.

The Third Wave (2007 film)

The Third Wave film was shot in Sri Lanka following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. It was directed by Australian film maker Alison Thompson and Italian producer Oscar Gubernati. 
Plot.
After the 2004 Asian tsunami disaster, four independent volunteers, with little money and no experience, race off to volunteer in tsunami ravaged Sri Lanka. They meet up by fate at the Colombo airport and form a volunteer team. They rent a van, fill it with supplies and start driving down the coast to see where they can help. They stumble into a tribal village called Peraliya, which has been destroyed by a forty foot wave. During the time the wave hit Peraliya, a train called "The Queen of the Sea" was passing by and was washed away killing over 2500 passengers and villagers. The Four volunteers set up a first aid station and found themselves in charge of running a refugee camp with over 3000 people. Their initial two week journey turns into a year long odyssey of heartbreak and hope as the villagers turn against them when donated tsunami relief money does not materialize. The volunteers concentrate on the bigger picture and break every rule in the 'Disaster Aid Books'.
Release.
The Third Wave first premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. In 2008 Sean Penn came aboard as Executive Producer and it screened in the first ever Presidential jury screening at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. The Third Wave has been an official selection of the Tokyo International film festival, Sydney International film festival, Denver film festival, Monaco Charity film festival, South Asian International film festival and City of Angels film festival in Los Angeles.

Avielochan

Avielochan () is a hamlet in the historical county of Inverness-shire, within the Highland council area of Scotland. It is located north of Aviemore, on the A9 road. The area is noted for its prehistoric cairn.
Geography and wildlife.
Avielochan is located in Strathspey in central, northern Scotland, within the Cairngorms National Park. The village is located south of Kinveachy and north of Granish. The settlement takes its name from the body of water Avie Lochan (meaning "the small lake of Avie) archaically named Loch-na- mhoon, measuring about 90 yards long, and 50 across. Prior to the great floods in 1829, there was a floating island on the loch measuring about 30 yards across. It attracts Ospreys during the spring and summer months and Golden Eye, Coot and Slavonian Grebe, amongst others. Red Squirrel, Red Deer, Roe Deer, Black Grouse and Capercaillie inhabit the area.
Buildings.
Avelochan Farm lets out self-catering cottages during the warmer months of the year to tourists.
The farm itself covers an area of 270 hectares, with arable fields, rough grazing and woodland. At certain times in the year it has around 80 cattle and some 60 Cheviot ewes which are crossed with a Suffolk tup before they are sold in early autumn.
One building of note is Clach Mhor (meaning 'big stone' in Gaelic) which is located on the edge of the village.
Chamber tomb.
The area is noted for its prehistoric chamber tomb stones which are said to be particularly old by some sources, although they have not been dated reliably. The site contains a cairn which is very circular in shape except for a slight flattening at the entrance, where part of a lignite amulet has been unearthed. The tumulus is about 40 feet in diameter.
The cairn is said to be "aligned" with Glen Einich, and has views of the Cairngorm Mountains.

Broussard's

Broussard's, along with Galatoire's, Antoine's, and Arnaud's, is one of the four classic Creole New Orleans restaurants known as the Grand Dames.
Broussard's first opened its doors in 1920, when an eminent local chef, Joseph Broussard, married Rosalie Borrello, and the couple moved into the Borrello family mansion (built in 1834) at 819 Conti Street in the French Quarter, where the restaurant now sits. Until their deaths, one month apart from each other in 1966, the Broussards resided in the apartment above the restaurant. The restaurant was purchased from the Broussard family and underwent a major renovation in the early 1970s. It was owned and operated by Joseph Marcello and Joseph Segreto from 1975-1984, and Chef Gunter Preuss and family from 1984-2013. Broussards underwent another major renovation in 2013 when it was purchased from the Preuss family by Creole Cuisine Restaurant Concepts. 
Historical Significance:
While the Napoleon (main) dining room was built in 1920, the adjoining dining rooms were constructed in 1831 and originally used as stables and slave quarters for the Hermann-Grima House, which now operates as a museum.

Life.
Geha was born in Aleppo, Syria in 1840, He was consecrated the Melkite Catholic Archbishop of Aleppo on May 3, 1885 by patriarch Gregory II Youssef. On June 29, 1902 he became patriarch of the Melkites. 
In 1909 Cyril convoked a synod at Ain Traz to develop the disciplinary legislation of the Melkite Church. However, the work of the synod failed to gain confirmation from Pope Pius X, who lacked the desire of his predecessor, Pope Leo XIII, to promote the traditional rights and privileges of the Eastern Churches.
Upon Cyril's death in 1916 the patriarchal see was vacant until the election of Demetrius I Qadi in 1919.

Brumado is a municipality of Bahia State, in Brazil. It was founded June 11, 1877. The population is 64,417 and the name for residents is Brumadense.
The city is known as the Ore Capital, it is because the extraction of minerals. Brumado is near the Chapada Diamantina and therefore close to areas deemed of exceptional natural beauty.
Vegetation and ecosystem.
Brumado has a very large biodiversity, both plant and animal specimens ranging from small to medium sized animals threatened with extinction. The brumadense fauna is composed mainly of animals adapted to the savanna vegetation that is characteristic of the region, but the municipality has little islands of forest small localized often called riparian margins of rivers and streams in the region. Biodiversity animal ends up most often with their natural habitat threatened by miners, ranchers and hunters, who seek territorial expansion, exploitation of natural resources and also the illegal trade in animals, thereby eventually causing a rampant predatory activity and without any control with respect the ecological imbalance that this action may cause. To add insult to injury is not making any allowance for this activity attitude leaving some of those copies of local biodiversity threatened with extinction, thus damaging the ecological balance of the region.
The city has a characteristic vegetation of scrub, riparian forest (vegetation typical of small tropical forest situated on the banks of rivers and streams of the region) and also isolated parts of dense forest called "general" in regions high in the city mainly from Sierra of mares. It is noteworthy that the plant species present in the region covering several groups and you can find copies of any size.
There are problems: the indiscriminate deforestation for charcoal production 3273 meters cubic, used for trade and to meet the pole ceramist, and clearing forests and vegetation for the livestock and to open mines triggered by some mining sites, but it is noteworthy that there are those who perform the appropriate reforestation aiming not reach the sources present in the mountains.
Brumado is possessed of several sources such as Bate Creek Foot, Creek Coité which rises in the Serra das Mares, which are called the interior marshes (an upwelling of groundwater in the region).
The natural heritage areas considered are:
Location: San Lorenzo Serra
Approximate distance from the central area: 18 km
Location: East of the Sierra Mares, across town to the river of Antonio.
Location: On the slope of the Rock Roll, Morro do Sobrado
Approximate distance from the central area: 19 km
Location: slopes of the Sierra Mares
Approximate distance from the central area: 18 km
Location: In the municipal seat
Location: West of the county seat

Studies involving the narrative of the geological history of a continent like South America based on the determination of ages of rocks and minerals, a branch called isotopic geochemistry geochronology. The longevity of the rocks is very varied. The oldest rock formations of the South American continent, at the age of 3.5 billion years, are in the state of Bahia, in the municipalities of the Brumado Vitória da Conquista.
Economy.
According to data from SEI / IBGE, the city's GDP for 2003 was R $ 306.18 million, 5.04% for agriculture, 52.31% to 46.24% for industry and services.

The tally wasn't bettered by any debutante in the VFL until Footscray's Bill Wood kicked nine goals in 1944. He finished the year with 22 goals which was enough to top St Kilda's goal-kicking and was again their leading goal-kicker the following season after kicking 44 goals. His final season at St Kilda, in 1913, was his finest and his 53 goals helped his club make their first ever Grand Final. Perhaps his best performance came in the Semi Final against South Melbourne when he kicked six goals. Only Jimmy Freake of Fitzroy kicked more goals in the league that season.
The full-forward joined East Perth in 1914 and the same year was chosen to represent Western Australia at the Sydney Carnival. He topped East Perth's goal-kicking in his first two seasons and finished with 68 WAFL goals from his 36 games.

Math Teams in Lexington Public Schools (Massachusetts)

The various math teams of the Lexington Public Schools system in Lexington, Massachusetts are renowned for their individual and team-wise successes in many events and competitions. The three major math teams in the Lexington Public Schools system are those at Lexington High School, William Diamond Middle School, and Jonas Clarke Middle School.
Middle school math teams.
Diamond and Clarke have math teams that are among the top in the region and in the country.
The coach of Diamond's team was Evagrio Mosca, who held that position until the end of the 2004-05 school year, at which point he moved on to take a position in the Belmont Public Schools system (he has since left that position). He was the coach of the 1999 Massachusetts Mathcounts team (which also included two Diamond students), which went on to win the national competition. Since the 2005-06 school year, Diamond's coach has been Kent Findell, the former coach at Winchester-McCall. Findell led Massachusetts' Mathcounts team in 2004 (which also included two Diamond students).
Once a teacher in the Exeter public schools in New Hampshire, Josh Frost became a math teacher and math team coach at Clarke, and under his leadership, Clarke has won the IMLEM in 2006-07 through 2012-13. (Diamond had been the league champions each of the prior nine years.) For the years that he has been at Clarke, Frost has coached the Mathcounts state team to attend nationals multiple times, and these teams have included students from both Clarke and Diamond.
Mathcounts.
Both schools have found success in Mathcounts competitions, as each has won the state-level competition multiple times. Many students from both Diamond and Clarke have qualified for the national competition. In each of the four years Massachusetts has won the team national championship, either Diamond or Clarke won the state competition, and thus the coach of the state team was a coach at one of the two Lexington middle schools.
In 1997 and 1999, the national champion Massachusetts was led by longtime Diamond coach Evagrio Mosca. The 1999 team also included two students from Diamond, Liz Marcil and Mark Lipson.
In 2012, Clarke won the State Competition for the seventh straight year, and Alec Sun became the only 3 time state champion in Massachusetts Mathcounts history. At the National Competition, the Massachusetts team, including Sun and Clarke coach Josh Frost, won the team title, and Sun won the individual championship. Sun joins Lexington native Jonathan Weinstein as two of the three individual national champions to have come from Massachusetts.
New England Mathematics League (NEML).
All students in Diamond and Clarke participate in middle school NEML competitions, and both schools have performed remarkably over the years. However, results were not recorded for either school in the 2012-2013 school year.
Intermediate Math League of Eastern Massachusetts (IMLEM).
Intermediate Math League of Eastern Massachusetts (IMLEM) is the major math league in the region. Clarke and Diamond have had superior success in the league, as the two schools account for each of the last 16 IMLEM championships between 1997-98 and 2012-13. Diamond had won the league nine straight years (1997-98 through 2005-06) before Clarke won the league the last seven (2006-07 through 2012-13).
DPY Mathematics Competition.
Some of the schools have recently participated in the "DPY Mathematics Competition." The year of 2013-2014 is only the second year of participation.
High school competitions.
In addition, a few students from Diamond and Clarke take a few of the individual high school competitions held by Lexington High School, mostly participating in the AMC, high school NEML contests, and the MAML-organized MMO (although no students not in high school are eligible to take the MMO Level Two exam).
Lexington High School math team.
Although fierce competitive rivals at the middle school level, many math team participants from Diamond and Clarke also participate at the high school, and that has garnered success for the high school as well.
The current coach of the Lexington High School math team is Albert Roos, who took the position when the former longtime coach, Saleh Rahman, retired after the 2006-07 school year.
WPI Invitational Math Meet.
The WPI Invitational Math Meet, which has been held 22 times through 2009-10, has been won by Lexington High School 21 times, from 1988-1994 and from 1996-2010.
American Mathematics Competitions (AMC).
Lexington High School has generally done well in the American Mathematics Competitions, making the school honor roll for the AMC 12 in both 2007 and 2008. This has also translated up the AMC ladder, as Lexington High School has produced at least three USAMO qualifiers in every year since 2000, including seven in 2006 (a recent school record), four in 2007 (one additional student from Clarke qualified), and five in 2008.
In 2009, 5 students from Lexington High School, as well as 2 from Clarke, qualified for the USAMO. In 2010, with the split of the USAMO format into the USAMO and the new USA Junior Math Olympiad (USAJMO), Lexington had 5 USAMO qualifiers (one was from Clarke), and 5 USAJMO qualifiers. From 2006-2011, Lexington had a total of 34 USAMO qualifiers, including 4 middle schoolers. In the two years of USAJMO's existence, Lexington had 9 total qualifiers, including 2 middle schoolers. Since 1987, there were 76 USAMO qualifiers from Lexington High School, enough for being ranked 7th in the nation.
Lexington High School's Math Department has received national merit through the AMC, as the Sliffe Award has been won by 8 Lexington High School teachers (actually, 2 teach at Diamond, and 1 at Clarke, and all but the one at Clarke are listed under Lexington High School) a total of 11 times. Lexington High School also has the most two-time winners (3 teachers; no teacher can win it more than twice). Indian Woods Middle School, Shawnee Mission, KS (10) and Frost Middle School, Fairfax, VA (11) are the only other schools to have teachers win the award 10 or more times.
Harvard–MIT Mathematics Tournament (HMMT).
Lexington High School's math team has also sent teams to HMMT, where in 2008, Lexington High School's top team (known as "Lexington Alpha" that year) finished fifth in the sweepstakes. In past years, Lexington High School also has had a few students finish in the top ten in certain individual categories. The high school has also won second place overall at each of the first two Harvard-MIT November Tournaments (HMNT), held in 2008-09 and 2009-10.
MML, GBML, MAML, and NEAML.
Lexington High School also sends teams to Massachusetts Mathematics League (MML) and Greater Boston Mathematics League (GBML) meets, through which it has had superior success in qualifying for and winning the MAML (Massachusetts Association of Math Leagues) State Meet and the NEAML (New England Association of Math Leagues) New England Meet. The team last won the State Meet in 2009-10, and the New England Meet in 2007-08, and since 2000, the team has finished worse than second at only one of these meets (it finished third in the 2004-05 New England Meet).
Lexington High School participates in the individual MAML-organized Massachusetts Mathematics Olympiad (MMO), with many semifinalists and finalists in the MMO Level One exam. Also, Lexington has had many students finish in the top 20 of the MMO Level Two exam, including 4 in 2008, 3 in 2007, 5 in 2006, and 3 in 2005.
New England Mathematics League (NEML).
Lexington High School participates in the high school Math League contests, usually finishing in the top five in New England each year.
Mandelbrot Competition.
Lexington High School competed in the Mandelbrot Competition for the first time in 2009-10.
Competitors.
Most of Lexington High School's nationwide competition has come primarily from magnet schools such as Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST), the Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology (AAST), and Phillips Exeter Academy, whose student populations consists of applicants from wider districts of people.

Polly (brig)

Polly was an American brig that was swamped during a gale in late 1811, and spent the next six months adrift in the Atlantic Ocean. The saga of "Polly" was mentioned by Edgar Allan Poe in his novel "The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket".
History.
"Polly" was a 131-ton brig, probably constructed by shipbuilder Alden Briggs, at Pembroke, Massachusetts, sometime between 1788 and 1805. During her service life, the ship was home ported in Boston, Massachusetts.
Shipwreck.
On December 12, 1811, "Polly" departed Boston with a cargo of lumber and provisions (including salted meat) bound for the Virgin Islands. The ship was commanded by Captain Casneau, and carried eight others: the mate, four seamen, an Indian cook, a passenger named Mr. Hunt, and a 12 year-old African-American slave or servant girl belonging to Hunt.
Three days out, on December 15, the "Polly" was caught in a severe gale. The storm capsized the ship and the masts were either carried away by the storm, or cut away by the crew. Relieved of the topweight, "Polly" rolled back onto an even keel. The ship was completely filled with water, but the cargo of lumber kept the ship afloat. However, two people, one of whom was Hunt, were lost during the storm, and the girl was badly injured.
The survivors began to salvage the wreck for usable items. Quantities of salted pork were recovered, and the survivors ate that raw until the cook managed to start a fire twelve days after the wreck, by using two sticks rubbed together. The supplies of salted pork ran out after forty days, and the survivors were forced to eat barnacles scraped off the hull, and the occasional shark and fish. The barnacles were exhausted by mid-April, but the survivors managed to catch additional fish. Stores of fresh water ran out after eighteen days, and water was subsequently obtained from a makeshift still made out of a tea kettle, a metal pot, and a pistol. Seawater was boiled in the pot, and condensation was captured in the tea kettle.
Over the next 191 days, "Polly" drifted across the Atlantic. The hulk was passed by over a dozen ships, but none offered assistance. Henry Howes, the first mate, was the first of the survivors to die, either 43 or 50 days after the wreck. Three other crewmen followed suit. Some references indicate the cook died at this time, while others indicate the cook survived the ordeal. By the 65th day, only two survivors remained.
On June 19, 1812, Captain Casneau and either the cook or a crewmember named Samuel Badger, were rescued by Captain Featherstone of the British ship "Fame", en route to London from Rio de Janeiro. The crew were picked up 600 leagues (3,330 kilometers) west of Marrakesh, having drifted over two thousand miles across the Atlantic. On July 9, the survivors were transferred to the brig "Dromero" and taken back to the United States.
The story of the "Polly" is mentioned in an in-character footnote in Chapter 13 of Edgar Allan Poe's "The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket". Poe's narrator, Arthur Pym, refers to the ordeal as similar to the one he experiences in the course of the narrative. Poe's source for the material may have been R. Thomas' "Remarkable Events and Remarkable Shipwrecks", published in 1836.

Herbert 'Bill' Woodcock (born 29 June 1888) was an Australian rules footballer who played for St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL).
Woodcock, who was recruited to St Kilda locally, used his powerful build to good effect as a ruck shepherd. Also a butcher by profession, Woodcock participated in the 1913 Grand Final which they lost to Fitzroy. He joined former St Kilda teammates Ernie Sellars and George Morrissey at East Perth in 1915 and played there for three seasons. In 1918 he returned to St Kilda and remained with the club until 1921.

Suero de Quiñones

Suero de Quiñones (c. 1409 – 11 July 1456), called "Él del Passo" ("he of the pass"), was a Leonese knight and author. He gained fame by staging a "pas d'armes", the "Passo Honroso", at the river Órbigo and describing it in his "Libro del Passo honroso".
Suero was the son of Diego Fernández de Quiñones, called "el Afortunado", who was beneficed by his uncle Pedro Suárez and named sole heir of his possessions. Diego married María de Toledo, who bore him ten children, Suero being the second. Suero fasted in honour of the Virgin Mary every Tuesday, wore an iron necklet every Thursday as a sign of devotion to his lady, and heard Mass daily.
From 10 July to 9 August 1434 at the Órbigo bridge in Castile, Suero and ten of his companions encamped in a field beside the bridge and challenged each knight who wished to cross it to a joust. This road was used by pilgrims all over Europe on the way to shrine at Santiago de Compostela, and at this time of the summer, many thousands would cross the bridge. Suero and his men swore to "break 300 lances" before moving on.
The men fought for over a month, an account of which is left to us in great detail by town notary Don Luis Alonso Luengo who kept a detailed first-hand chronicle (latter published as "Libro del Passo honroso"). After 166 battles Suero and his men were so injured they could not continue and declared the mission complete. Suero de Quiñones became legendary in Spanish history and was mentioned in "Don Quixote", the 1605 satire on the sort of romantic chivalry out of touch with reality.

Billboard Hot 100 50th Anniversary Charts

The "Billboard" Hot 100 50 Year Anniversary Charts are historical charts from the Hot 100's first 50 years, August 1958 through July 2008. "Alfred Music" publishing house, saluted the 50th, by publishing the ""Hot 100 50th Anniversary Songbook.""
Criteria Billboard used to create the "50th Anniversary" chart position.
The songs in the "50th Anniversary" charts had to appear on the Hot 100 in order to be counted. This may create some confusion ("for example: many great country artists and songs are not on the "50th Anniversary" chart because, while very popular on the country charts they didn't cross over to the Hot 100"). Also, keep in mind the Hot 100 started in August 1958 so any prior songs are not listed, including some popular Elvis Presley songs.
The "50th Anniversary" chart is based on actual performance on the weekly Billboard Hot 100. The artist chart utilizes the same methodology, with weighted points applied to all titles charted by each artist during that 50-year span. They are ranked based on an inverse point system, with weeks at number one earning the greatest value and weeks at number one hundred earning the least.
Hot 100's 50th Anniversary award relative points for every week that a title spent on the chart, regardless of rank. For the Hot 100's 50th Anniversary, Billboard's charts department ensured a more balanced representation of hits from all 50 years, by analyzing the length of chart runs in earlier decades, as well as the average weeks that titles spent in the top 10 and at number one. Weights for earlier spans were then formulated, to compensate for the shorter chart runs that titles experienced before the 1991 conversion to precise and objective sales and radio data from Nielsen Music.
Prior to December 1998, songs did not appear on the Billboard Hot 100 until a retail single became available (which, incidentally, is why hits like Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven" and No Doubt's "Don't Speak" never appeared on the Hot 100). In earlier years, retail singles came to market fairly early in a song's life-usually shortly after, or even before, a song came to radio.
But, during the 1990s, when labels would strategize number-one chart bows by significant hits, the retail release of some priority singles were withheld until radio audience reached maximum levels. Although some of these songs spent significant numbers of weeks at number one or in the top ten, the delay of the sales component ultimately shortened the spans these songs would spend on the chart. With the new methodology rewarding points for a song's entire chart run, rather than confining points to weeks spent in the top ten, the shorter chart lives recorded by the songs that debuted at number one impact their all-time standings.

The Killing Star

The Killing Star is a hard science fiction novel by Charles R. Pellegrino and George Zebrowski, published in April, 1995. It covers several familiar speculative fiction ideas such as sublight interstellar travel, genetic cloning, virtual reality, advanced robotics, alien contact, and interstellar war.
Plot summary.
The late 21st century seems like a good time to be alive. Earth is at peace. Humans now command self-replicating machines that create engineering marvels on enormous scales. Artificial habitats dot the solar system. Anti-matter driven Valkyrie rockets carry explorers to the stars at nearly the speed of light. All seems well.
Then, from the uncaring black of space come swarms of relativistic missiles. Though they are merely boulder-sized hunks of metal, they move fast enough to hit with the force of many nuclear arsenals. They are impossible to track and impossible to stop. Humanity is all but wiped out by the horrific bombardment. (To read a discussion of relativistic weapons and an excerpt of the attack, look here.)
A handful of survivors desperately struggle to escape the alien mop-up fleet. They hide close to the sun, inside asteroids, beneath the crusts of moons, within ice rings, and in the fathomless depths of interstellar space. But most are hunted down and slaughtered.
The last man and woman on Earth are captured as zoo specimens. In the belly of an alien starship, a squid-like being relates to them the pitiless logic behind human-kind's execution: the moment humans learned to travel at relativistic speeds was the moment mankind simply became too dangerous a neighbor to have around. Nothing personal.
Plot Threads.
The following is an overview of the various survival stories listed according to their location.
Sun - A single spacecraft grazes the Sun while playing a game of cat and mouse with an intruder starship. The humans use negative energy bombs to cause a massive solar eruption which destroys the alien pursuers. Several years later, at the book's end, this band makes the Sun go nova, thus cleansing the solar system of the intruders.
Earth - The last people alive on Earth are a man and woman in a submersible. The relativistic missiles hit while they are surveying the RMS Titanic. One of the characters finds respite in a virtual reality program of the Titanic. Eventually the couple goes ashore at New York City where the only evidence they find that humankind ever existed is the plumbing for a swimming pool buried deep beneath the mud. The pair regularly send out distress calls which the aliens home in on. The two survivors are captured as zoo specimens.
Ceres - Colonists living within the dwarf planet Ceres escape the initial attack unnoticed. Unfortunately, the waste heat from normal colony operations, plus the colony's cavern excavations, have produced an unmistakable corona of dust and infrared emissions. The colonists know they will likely draw the aliens' attention sooner or later, but have no choice but to try to hide. They drop power usage to near zero and cut all radio transmissions. The aliens, however, broadcast a virus program which one of the Ceres robots picks up. The virus tells the robot to make self-replicating nanomachines. These "Grey goo" nanobots (the book describes them as self-replicating molecules that raise the melting point of ceramic and metal compounds) disassemble the Ceres habitat, killing all the colonists.
Saturn - Clones of what some believe to be the historical Jesus and Buddha lead their flock away from Saturn's rings. The group plans to hide around the energy rich brown dwarfs in the interstellar medium. There they hope to rebuild human civilization and eventually strike back at the alien murderers.
Neptune - Some humans hiding below the frozen crust of Neptune's moon, Triton take their ship to Neptune to see about establishing a deep ocean base. The captain, however, has a mental breakdown and drives his vessel down until it implodes. 
Deep Space - Several interplanetary vessels and a few Valkyries returning from interstellar missions are destroyed early on. A Valkyrie is shot down by another Valkyrie-mounted railgun to prevent it from accidentally betraying the location of the remaining pockets of humanity. There is some speculation that a handful of husband/wife teams in Valkyrie ships in nearby starsystems may still survive.
Contemporary and historical references.
"The Killing Star" makes several references to historic and contemporary people, places, and things. A few notables include the following:
We Are the World by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie - Six alien ships patrolling through the post-attack solar system continually broadcast this song. It served both as a taunt to the pathetic survivors and as a carrier for computer viruses. The aliens chose this song partly because on April 5, 1985 it constituted the single strongest radio transmission ever sent from Earth. It also conveyed the disturbing impression that humanity might become a unified force to reckon with.
Star Trek: The Next Generation - The aliens presented to two of the human survivors footage from several Star Trek episodes as examples of our fiction reflecting a deep rooted desire to dominate all other species.
Titanic - One of the survivors on Earth spent an inordinate amount of time in a virtual reality simulation of the "Titanic". He tinkered with the program until, without knowing it, he made it sentient. Since the artificial intelligence was a representation of his mother, the AI convinced him to delete her so that he could get back to the business of living.
Jurassic Park - Dinosaurs, ancient flora, and even historical figures were cloned in the novel.

Horsebread

Horsebread was a type of bread sometimes consumed in medieval Europe. This bread was, at the time considered a low-quality bread, made from legumes such as dry split peas as well as, or instead of grains, and was one of the cheapest breads available. It was fed to horses but also eaten in times of famine by the indigent and those who could not afford white bread (which was the most labour-intensive, and therefore expensive bread) or other breads like rye or barley breads.
White breads were generally only eaten by the wealthy, because of the labor involved in refining flour and because of the lower nutritional content. This is in contrast with modern whole grain breads, which are typically seen as premium priced health foods or gourmet foods. This is in part because modern flour has a higher gluten content than flour produced in medieval Europe, and thus bread made from less refined flour is more palatable than it would have been during the Middle Ages.

Valangai

Valangai or the right hand refers to a caste-based division of communities in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu that was in vogue from ancient times right up to the 19th and even the early decades of the 20th century AD. Since India's independence, the differences have practically vanished.
The "Valangai" or right-handed faction was made up of castes with an agricultural basis while the "Idangai" was made of metal workers, weavers, etc. i.e. castes involved in manufacturing.
The Valangai faction was numerically superior to the "Idangai" or left-handed faction. There were 6 castes in the "Idangai" faction as opposed to sixty in the "Valangai" faction. The "Valangai" faction was better organized, politically, than the "Idangai".
Jean-Antoine Dubois on "Valangai" writes, The "Paraiyars" are its chief support, as a proof of which they glory in the title ‘Valangai-Mougattar’, or friends of the Right-hand.
During the Chola period, the left and right-hand factions comprised ninety-eight castes each, but by the 19th century, the right-hand faction was made of 60 castes, and the left-hand, only six.

<doc id="19406872" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19406872" title="Overnight indexed swap">
Overnight indexed swap

An overnight indexed swap (OIS) is an interest rate swap where the periodic floating rate of the swap is equal to the geometric average of an overnight rate (or overnight index rate) over every day of the payment period. 
The index rate is typically the rate for overnight unsecured lending between banks, for example the Federal funds rate for US dollars, Eonia for Euros or Sonia for sterling. The fixed rate of OIS is typically an interest rate considered less risky than the corresponding interbank rate (LIBOR) because there is limited counterparty risk.
The LIBOR–OIS spread is the difference between LIBOR and the (OIS) rates. The spread between the two rates is considered to be a measure of health of the banking system. It is an important measure of risk and liquidity in the money market, considered by many, including former US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, to be a strong indicator for the relative stress in the money markets. A higher spread (high Libor) is typically interpreted as indication of a decreased willingness to lend by major banks, while a lower spread indicates higher liquidity in the market. As such, the spread can be viewed as indication of banks' perception of the creditworthiness of other financial institutions and the general availability of funds for lending purposes.
The LIBOR–OIS spread has historically hovered around 10 basis points (bps). However, in the midst of the financial crisis of 2007–2010, the spread spiked to an all-time high of 364 basis points in October 2008, indicating a severe credit crunch. Since that time the spread has declined erratically but substantially, dropping below 100 basis points in mid-January 2009 and returning to 10–15 basis points by September 2009.
Risk barometer.
Three-month LIBOR is generally a floating rate of financing, which fluctuates depending on how risky a lending bank feels about a borrowing bank. The OIS is a swap derived from the overnight rate, which is generally fixed by the local central bank. The OIS allows LIBOR-based banks to borrow at a fixed rate of interest over the same period. In the United States, the spread is based on the LIBOR Eurodollar rate and the Federal Reserve's Fed Funds rate.
LIBOR is "risky" in the sense that the lending bank loans cash to the borrowing bank, and the OIS is "stable" in the sense that both counterparties only swap the floating rate of interest for the fixed rate of interest. The spread between the two is, therefore, a measure of how likely borrowing banks will default. This reflects "counterparty credit risk premiums" in contrast to "liquidity risk premiums". However, given the mismatch in the tenor of the funding, it also reflects worries about liquidity risk as well.
Historical levels.
In the United States, the LIBOR–OIS spread generally maintains around 10 . This changed abruptly, as the spread jumped to a rate of around 50 in early August 2007 as the financial markets began to price in a higher risk environment. Within months, the Bank of England was forced to rescue Northern Rock from failure. The spread continued to maintain historically high levels as the crisis continued to unfold.
As markets improved, the spread fell and as of October 2009, stood at 10 once again, only to rise again as struggles of the PIIGS countries threatened European banks. As of December 2011, the spread again stands at 40+ bps level.

Siege of Baghdad (812–813)

The siege of Baghdad was a part of a civil war between al-Amin and al-Ma'mun for the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad. The siege lasted from August 812 until September 813. The siege is described in great detail by Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari in his famous "History of the Prophets and Kings".
Initial battles en route to Baghdad.
After the defeat of Caliph al-Amin's army at the Battle of Rayy and the death of his commander Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan, the armies of al-Amin were in retreat moving west from Iran to Iraq back to their base camp at Baghdad. Al-Ma'mun's general Tahir ibn Husayn, the victor of Battle of Rayy decided to chase the retreating army. However, reinforcements from Baghdad arrived under the able leadership of Abd al-Rahman ibn Jabala. Abd al-Rahman decided to fortify himself behind the walls and gates of Hamadan. But when Tahir ibn Husayn came closer to the city, Abd al-Rahman decided to come out and meet this threat head on. Twice Abd al-Rahman was driven back into the city. Tahir ibn Husayn began a blockade of the city and Abd al-Rahman’s forces began to shower arrows and throw stones from the city walls. Eventually Abd al-Rahman was obliged to leave and ask for terms due to resentment of the people of Hamadan at the occupation and rapidly depleting supplies.
Tahir ibn Husayn, realizing that Abd al-Rahman ibn Jabala had left the city, decided not to waste further time in Hamadan and marched westward towards Baghdad. On his way, he reached a certain pass named Asadabad where his army was ambushed by Abd al-Rahman ibn Jabala. The surprise attack caught Tahir’s troops off guard. But because the army was well disciplined the infantry managed to hold them off until Tahir ibn Husayn’s cavalry was ready to attack. In the ensuing confusion Abd al-Rahman ibn Jabala who had dismounted his horse was killed and his army defeated.
After the short delay, Tahir ibn Husayn began his march towards Baghdad again. The news of the defeat of first Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan and now Abd al-Rahman ibn Jabala reached Caliph al-Amin and greatly distressed him. It seemed to the people of Baghdad that Tahir ibn Husayn was unstoppable. Nevertheless, people in al-Ahwaz under the leadership of Muhammad ibn Yazid al-Muhallabi put up a fierce resistance to the armies of Tahir ibn Husayn. After defeating the army of al Muhallabi, Tahir reached the gates of Baghdad and at the right time too as his reinforcements arrived under the leadership of Harthama ibn A'yan.
The Siege.
The siege has no parallel in warfare of the time. Although the city was surrounded by walls most of the population lived in suburbs which were not. The siege was therefore not an attack on a fortified perimeter but rather street fighting, house to house invasion as well as temporary improvised fortifications. It was extremely destructive especially for the civilian population. Immediately, Tahir ibn Husayn ordered the other commanders namely Zuhayr ibn al-Musayyab al-Dabbi and Harthama ibn A’yan to set up camps at Qasr Raqqat Kalwadha and Nahr Bin respectively, while he set up camp at al-Anbar Gate. They set up siege engines, mangonels, and dug trenches. Both sides are known to have used siege weapons. At one point, a general of al-Amin known as al-Samarqandi used boats to transport mangonels on the river Tigris and bombard enemy positions in the suburbs of Baghdad inflicting more damage to the civilian population than to the besiegers. There were several vicious battles, such as at al-Amin's palace of Qasr Halih, at Darb al-Hijarah and al-Shammasiyyah Gate. In the later stages of the siege irregulars came to the aid of al-Amin.
As things were getting worse and Tahir ibn Husayn pushed into the city, al-Amin sought to negotiate safe passage out. Tahir ibn Husayn reluctantly agreed on the condition that al-Amin turn over his scepter, seal and other insignia of the caliphal office. Al-Amin, reluctant to do so, tried to leave on a boat. Tahir ibn Husayn noticed the boat and sent his men after the Caliph, who was captured and brought to a room where he was executed. His head was placed on the al-Anbar Gate. Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari quotes Tahir's letter to the new Caliph al-Ma'mun informing him of al-Amin's capture and execution and the state of peace resulting in Baghdad.
Aftermath.
The end result was that al-Ma'mun became the new Abbasid Caliph. Yet, he would not arrive in Baghdad until 819 due to the destruction and continued disturbances in the city.

Nocturne (painting)

Nocturne painting is a term coined by James Abbott McNeill Whistler to describe a painting style that depicts scenes evocative of the night or subjects as they appear in a veil of light, in twilight, or in the absence of direct light. In a broader usage, the term has come to refer to any painting of a night scene, or night-piece, such as Rembrandt's "The Night Watch".
Whistler used the term within the title of his works to represent paintings with a "dreamy, pensive mood" by applying a musical name. He also titled (and retitled) works using other terms associated with music, such as a "symphony", "harmony", "study" or "arrangement", to emphasize the tonal qualities and the composition and to de-emphasize the narrative content. The use of the term "nocturne" can be associated with the Tonalism movement of the American of the late 19th century and early 20th century which is "characterized by soft, diffused light, muted tones and hazy outlined objects, all of which imbue the works with a strong sense of mood." Along with winter scenes, nocturnes were a common Tonalist theme.Frederic Remington used the term as well for his nocturne scenes of the American Old West.
Rembrandt’s nocturnes.
In northern Europe, the Dutch Golden Age produced one of the greatest artists of all time. The first artist to paint scenes on a regular basis in the nocturne mode was Rembrandt van Rijn (1606–1669). Many of his portraits were also painted using a nocturne method. As in "The Mill" (1645), most of his landscapes were painted to evoke a sense of the nocturne, which could be expressed in either a calm or stormy manner.
Nocturnes by James Abbott McNeill Whistler.

“Nocturne” was a term that was normally applied to certain types of musical compositions before James Abbott McNeill Whistler (1834–1903), inspired by the language of music, began using the word within the titles of many of his works, such as "Nocture in Blue and Silver" (1871), in the collection of the Tate Gallery, London, United Kingdom.
Frederic Remington’s nocturnes.
Frederic Remington (1861-1909) is so identified for his nocturne scenes of the American Old West that they were celebrated in 2003-2004 with an exhibition, "Frederic Remington: The Color of Night", co-organized and shown in turn by the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., and the Gilcrease Museum, Tulsa, Oklahoma. The exhibition also generated a colorful book of the same title and travelled to the Denver Art Museum in Denver, Colorado. Remington painted many of his nocturnes in the last years of his life, when he was transitioning from a career as an illustrator to that of a fine artist and had chosen Impressionism as the style in which he worked at the time. One example of his work is "The Stampede" (also known as "The Stampede by Lightning", 1908).

Tupolev I-8

Tupolev I-8 (also known as ANT-13) was an experimental interceptor built in the Soviet Union in the early 1930s. It was the first Soviet aircraft to exceed 300 km/h (162 knots, 186 mph) in level flight. The aircraft was an exercise in developing the Polikarpov I-5 design by a group of engineers led by V. M. Rodionov each of whom volunteered 70 hours of personal time to the project.
The I-8 first flew on 28 October 1930 with M. M. Gromov at the controls. Despite promising performance, the aircraft did not advance beyond prototype phase because there were no plans to acquire the Curtiss V-1570 engine and no domestic equivalent was available.

Heinrich Timm

Heinrich Timm (30 April 1910 in Bremen – 12 April 1974 in Axstedt) was a German U-boat commander in World War II and recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.
The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.
Naval career.
Timm joined the "Kriegsmarine" in October 1933. He first served as a junior officer aboard the minesweepers "M-132" and "M-110", before taking command of "M-7" in July 1939. His first success came on 9 January 1940 when he attacked the Royal Navy's submarine with depth charges in the Heligoland Bight, then forcing her to the surface and then being scuttled.
Timm won the Iron Cross during the Norwegian invasion in May 1940, and then he transferred into the U-boat fleet. After U-Boat commander's training at Pillau, in September 1941 Timm took command of the new Type VIIC U-boat . After training missions in the Baltic Sea, the "U-251" was assigned to the "11th U-boat Flotilla", which was based at Bergen, Norway, in April 1942. Timm next commanded nine war patrols into the Arctic Sea, on the prowl against the arctic convoys of World War II to the northern seaports of the Soviet Union. There, the "U-251" sank two merchant ships: The first one, on 3 May 1942, was the 6,135 ton British merchant ship SS "Jutland" of Convoy PQ-15, while the second, in July 1942, was the American cargo ship from the ill-fated Convoy PQ 17. Timm also took part in "Operation Wunderland" in the Kara Sea, surfacing close to Uyedineniya Island and destroying a Soviet weather station with cannon fire from his deck gun.
When the "U-251" was decommissioned to be overhauled in June 1943, Timm and his crew were sent to take over the new Type IXD2 U-boat , and after training missions in the Baltic Sea, they sailed her to the Indian Ocean during mid-1944 to join the "Monsun Gruppe" of U-boats prowing in the Indian Ocean and farther east, from Japanese-held naval bases.
The "U-862" sank five merchantmen and also shot down a British Catalina flying boat of No. 265 Squadron RAF while "en route". On 5 July, Timm received notification of his promotion to "Korvettenkapitän".
Then, while patrolling off eastern Australia in late 1944 and early 1945, Timm sank two American Liberty ship merchantmen. In January 1945, the "U-862" entered and departed from the Port of Napier, New Zealand, undetected. This later gave rise to the widely circulated post-war "tall tale" that Timm lead members of his crew ashore near Napier in order to milk some cows to supplement their meagre rations.
After the surrender of Nazi Germany on May 7, 1945, all of the German U-boat crews in the Far East were interned by the Japanese Empire at Singapore, and their U-boats were confiscated by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The "U-862" was commissioned into the Japanese Navy as the "I-502".
Korvettenkapitän Timm and his crewmen were still being held in Singapore when units of the Royal Navy arrived there on September 12, 1945. The German seamen were taken into custody by the British, and they were taken to Great Britain during July 1946, and then still held prisoner, even though Nazi Germany had surrendered over a year earlier.
Korvettenkapitän Timm was finally released from British captivity in April 1948.
Timm's Postwar Activities.
Timm joined the new West German Bundesmarine (navy) when it was established in 1956. Timm served in several positions, including that of the first commander of the West German frigate "Scharnhorst". Timm finally retired from the Bundesmarine in 1966 with the rank of "Fregattenkapitän".

Bernart Arnaut d'Armagnac (died 1226), also Bernard Arnaud, was a troubadour and from 1217 the Count of Armagnac in opposition to his brother, Gerald V, who inherited it from the childless Gerald IV. Bernart and Gerald were both sons of Bernard de Fézensaguet.
Sometime before 1217, Bernart Arnaut had a literary correspondence with the trobairitz Lombarda. The background ("razo") to this exchange ("tenso") is described in Lombarda's "vida". Bernart, after visiting and befriending Lombarda, left her (probably in Toulouse) without seeing her for a last time. He then sent her his song "Lombards volgr'eu eser per Na Lombarda". Lombarda responded with "Nom volgr' aver per Bernard Na Bernarda". Their exchange has inspired many feminist readings. Bernart begins by taking the name "Lombards" in honour of his lady; Lombarda responds by calling her self "Bernarda". If Bernart's taking of his ladyfriend's name is regarded as a patriarchal move to subsume a woman's identity in her man, then Lombarda's response will be seen as an assertion of her individualism. Bernart also refers to Jordan III of L'Isle-Jourdain in his poem.

Redhead Day

Redhead Day ("Roodharigendag" in Dutch) is the name of a Dutch summer festival that takes place each first weekend of September in the city of Breda, in the Netherlands. The two-day festival is a gathering of people with natural red hair, but is also focused on art related to the colour red. Activities during the festival are lectures, workshops and demonstrations which are aimed specifically at red-haired people. The festival attracts attendance from 50 countries and is free due to sponsorship of the local government.
Years.
2005.
The festival started in 2005 unintentionally by the Dutch painter Bart Rouwenhorst in the small Dutch city Asten. As a painter, he was inspired by artists like Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Gustav Klimt. Both of these artists created dramatic portraits of women, and both artists made famous paintings depicting redheaded women.
To follow the footsteps of his favourite painters, Rouwenhorst planned an exhibition of 15 new paintings of redheads. Finding models was problematic, since redheads are rare in the Netherlands, only 2% of the population had natural red hair. To find models, an advertisement was placed in a local newspaper. However, instead of 15, 150 models volunteered. Not wanting to turn down so many potential models, Rouwenhorst decided to choose 14 models, organise a group photo shoot for remaining redheads, and have a lottery to decide by chance who would be the 15th and final model. This happening turned out to be the first Redheadday.
That year, the focus was on red-haired women only, since they were asked to volunteer to pose for the paintings. At the events in later years, the aim was to attract redheaded men as well as women, but still the sexes are not equally distributed. The first meeting attracted 150 natural redheads. Most attendees wore green clothing by request.
At the time, the event competed for publicity in the local newspapers in Asten with a local pumpkin contest. However, the Dutch national press made the event headline news. The mayor of Asten mentioned later that the event led to the first ever front-page publicity about the city of Asten in the national press.
2007.
The second event was organised in 2007, in and around the main church of Breda. On September 2, 2007, 800 redheads went to the city. The dress code was white. The festival was opened by the mayor of Breda, unveiling a painting of 50 redheads. The festival poster contained a picture of a redheaded model (Milanne) in a wedding dress. Redheaded children were allowed off school for a week because of this event. This holiday still continues for some schools in The Netherlands.
2008.
On 7 September 2008, about 1,500 to 2,000 redheads from 15 countries went to Breda to celebrate the third redheadday. The program consisted of 42 activities, including exhibitions of 40 artists. The dress code was black. The program was multi-lingual for the first time and the press coverage was worldwide. Articles appeared in newspapers from Norway to Hong Kong and Chile. In 2008 some Dutch calendars started noting the first Sunday of September as the official redheadday, a day honoring redheads. It complements Mothers Day and Father's Day, the celebrations honoring parents.
2009.
The 2009 event took place on Saturday 5 and Sunday 6 September. The location was again the city of Breda. On Saturday, the focus was on visitors from abroad. On Sunday, the main event took place, with the traditional group photo in the main city park of Breda. There were about 50 activities, ranging from large artistic photo shoots by artists, to workshops with children, and lectures on different aspects of red hair.
2010.
The 2010 event took place on Saturday 4 and Sunday 5 September. Again there were about 50 activities, ranging from large artistic photo shoots by artists, to workshops with children, and lectures on different aspects of red hair. This year however, the nature of the event was more international. Program booklets were provided in three languages (Dutch, English and German) and groups of redheads appeared with t-shirts and flags reflecting their home country, like Germany, France and Italy. This year, all hotels in the city center were booked full. The organisation estimated that 4,000 people with natural red hair came from 30 countries. Russian news made a report on the event.
2011.
The 2011 lasted from Friday September 2 to Sunday September 4. On Friday, an unofficial opening was held for the volunteers and some visitors from the Netherlands, Germany, UK, Ireland and the US. This year, there were more photoshoots. The organisation estimated that despite the forecasted rain, the same number of visitors came to Breda, this time from over 50 countries. Russian news made again a report on the event.
2012 and beyond.
Future meets are planned to take place in the first weekend of September. Dates are; 1st and 2 September 2012 in Breda, 31 August and the first of September 2013, 6th and 7 September 2014, 5th and 6 September 2015.
So far each event the number of visitors has grown spectacularly, even during the rainy 2008 edition. Therefore, the form or city location of the event may change in the future.

Mount Rutford

Mount Rutford is a sharp peak that rises to and marks the highest point on Craddock Massif in the Sentinel Range, Ellsworth Mountains. The peak stands just north of Bugueño Pinnacle and 2.1 mi north of Mount Craddock, with which this naming is associated. Prior to 2006 the peak had no name, but was visually identified by Camilo Rada and Damien Gildea as being higher than Mt Craddock, during their time on the summits of both Vinson (2004) and Craddock (2005). Thus they returned in 2006 and, as part of a larger GPS program, measured the height of this unnamed peak.
As a result of the new GPS data and a new 1:100,000 topographical map being produced by the Omega Foundation, the peak was then named in 2006 by US-ACAN after Robert Hoxie Rutford, member of J. Campbell Craddock’s University of Minnesota geological expedition to Ellsworth Mountains, 1962–63; leader, University of Minnesota expedition to Ellsworth Mountains, 1963–64; Director, Division of Polar Programs, NSF, 1975–77; President of SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research).

Goudi coup

The Goudi coup () was a military coup d'état that took place in Greece on the night of , starting at the barracks in Goudi, a neighbourhood on the eastern outskirts of Athens. The coup was a pivotal event in modern Greek history, as it led to the arrival of Eleftherios Venizelos in Greece and his eventual appointment as Prime Minister. At one stroke, this put an end to the old political system, and ushered in a new period. Henceforth and for several decades, Greek political life would be dominated by two opposing forces: liberal, republican Venizelism and conservative, monarchist anti-Venizelism.
The coup itself was the result of simmering tensions in Greek society, which reeled under the effects of the disastrous Greco-Turkish War of 1897, financial troubles, a lack of necessary reforms and disillusionment with the established political system. Emulating the Young Turks, several junior Army officers founded a secret society, the Military League. With Colonel Nikolaos Zorbas as their figurehead, on the night of 15 August, the Military League, having gathered together its troops in the Goudi barracks, issued a pronunciamiento to the government demanding an immediate turnaround for the country and its armed forces.
King George I gave in and replaced Prime Minister Dimitrios Rallis with Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis, without however satisfying the insurgents, who resorted to a large public demonstration the following month. When a stalemate was reached, the coup leaders appealed to a new and providential figure, the Cretan Eleftherios Venizelos, who respected democratic norms in calling for new elections. After his allies’ twin victories in the Hellenic Parliament in August and November 1910, Venizelos became Prime Minister and proceeded with the reforms demanded by the coup’s instigators.
Greece at the beginning of the 20th century.
The Congress of Berlin in 1878 and especially the Constantinople Conference of 1881 had been successes for Greek diplomacy. There, the country had won Thessaly and part of Epirus. In order to continue achieving the Megali Idea, Greece then turned to Macedonia and Crete, but met with severe setbacks.
Military humiliations.
From 1895, following the Hamidian massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire; Cretan Christians, then under Ottoman domination, demanded self-government on their island under the protection of the great powers. Massacres of Christians by Muslims led Greece to intervene, first by accepting the departure of volunteers from its shores, then by more and more directly sending part of its fleet, followed by troops at the beginning of 1897 just when Cretans themselves declared "enosis" (union with Greece). The intervention of the European powers (France, Great Britain, Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary and Germany) forced Greece to back down. The opposition criticised the feebleness and indecisiveness of the government, which declared war on the Ottomans at the beginning of April. Fighting lasted a month, which gave its name to the conflict (the Thirty Days’ War); the Greek defeat was thorough. Although Greece lost only small amounts territory on its northern border, it was forced to pay huge war reparations of 4 million Ottoman pounds to the victor. Coming on the heels of the public insolvency declared in 1893, it meant that Greece had to accept an International Financial Control commission (Διεθνής Οικονομικός Έλεγχος), which in effect diverted the Greek state's main income sources (state monopolies and port customs tariffs) to the repayment of Greece's public loans. Crete however became an autonomous state under international supervision, while remaining under the Sultan’s suzerainty.
Macedonia.
Macedonia was a region disputed between Greece, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria (created at the Congress of Berlin). On , the feast day of the Prophet Elijah (Bulg. "Ilinden"), the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising, sponsored by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, began. The uprising failed, and Turkish reprisals were severe, with 2,000 killed and villages and homes razed. Following these events, many Greeks became concerned with the level of Bulgarian activity in Macedonia. The "Ethniki Etairia" (National Society) was set up, which sent armed bands of Greeks ("makedonomakhoi"), tacitly aided by the government in Athens, which provided financial support through its consular agents such as Ion Dragoumis and training from military advisers such as Pavlos Melas. This began what is known in Greece as the "Macedonian Struggle", where Greeks clashed with Bulgarian "komitadjis", while both sides clashed with the Ottoman army and gendarmerie. Reprisals took many forms, including pillage, arson and assassination. Deeply concerned, the Western powers decided to intervene. The eventual plan was for an administrative reorganisation of the region that would allow for an ethnic-based partition. Thus, each of the ethnic groups concerned sought to strengthen its position so as to gain a maximum of territory when the potential partition came. The successes and sacrifices of young officers such as Melas restored the image of part of the army. In turn, the meddling of the European powers in internal Ottoman affairs contributed to the outbreak of the Young Turk Revolution of July 1908, which put an end to the Greek-Bulgarian clashes in Macedonia.
Consequences of the Young Turk Revolution.
Greece at the time was still embroiled in the Cretan question. In 1905, Eleftherios Venizelos had led the Theriso revolt against High Commissioner George of Greece, who had been appointed by the European powers, and demanded "enosis". In 1906, the Prince resigned, and a new Commissioner, the former Greek Prime Minister Alexandros Zaimis, was installed. The Young Turk Revolution pushed the Cretans to unilaterally proclaim definitive "enosis", taking advantage of the absence of the new High Commissioner.
Anti-Greek demonstrations took place in Turkey, where the press launched a similar campaign. The European powers displayed hostility toward Greece, while Georgios Theotokis’ government was subject to increasing criticism. His replacement with Rallis had little effect. The new prime minister hastened to show signs of goodwill toward the Turkish ambassador and the Western powers. Wishing to avoid a new Greco-Turkish war, he criticised the “Cretan revolutionaries” and declared his willingness to abide by the Great Powers’ decisions. Indignation toward the government’s weaknesses and timorous attitude mounted, among the populace as well as in the army, above all among the young officers who had fought in Macedonia. The idea of imitating the Young Turk officers began to spread.
Economic and social situation.
Greece had been in economic crisis for decades. Public debt (owed above all to the Great Powers) dating back to the War of Independence reached new heights in the 1890s. At that point the government of Charilaos Trikoupis recognised that the country was bankrupt by deciding to lower the public debt to 30% of its value, which angered the creditors, particularly the European powers. At the same time, export of the Zante currant entered a crisis. A new phenomenon then began: emigration of the working population. The number of emigrants (especially to the United States) went from 1,108 in 1890 to 39,135 in 1910 (of 2.8 million inhabitants); significantly, remittances from America and Egypt fell amid economic slowdown in 1908. Economic growth was too slow for the workers and farmers who left to seek work elsewhere. Until that time, only highlanders and landless island dwellers had left. However, this economic growth did lead to the creation, as elsewhere in Europe in the same period, of a middle class born out of industrial development, of growth in the number of bureaucrats (linked to political clientelism) and to an urban explosion. In the mid-1900s, this middle class could not understand why the country was prosperous while the state’s finances were in such poor shape. Politicians, also dissatisfied with government policy, reacted as well. In 1906, a group of youngish radicals nicknamed the "Japanese Group" (Ομάς Ιαπώνων), in reference to the dynamism of the Meiji period, formed around the titular leadership of Stephanos Dragoumis, with Dimitrios Gounaris its moving spirit. It criticised the old oligarchy that was ruining the country and demanded radical reforms. The group of “sociologists” (Κοινωνιολόγοι), especially influenced by Marxism, also called for modernisation of the state apparatus and the economy.
The coup.
The Military League.
The Military League (Στρατιωτικός Σύνδεσμος) was formed in October 1908 out of two groups: one of Army NCOs (with members including future generals Nikolaos Plastiras and Georgios Kondylis) and one of junior officers around Theodoros Pangalos. They were motivated by a variety of reasons: a desire for reforms that was prevalent in wide parts of society was combined with frustration at the slow rate of promotions and the absence of meritocracy, especially among graduates of the Military Academy. Other officers from the Army, the Navy and the gendarmerie joined up later, and by June 1909, had spread out over the Greek military.
At that time the Military League’s demands were limited to an increased military budget, its reorganisation and modernisation, as well as the dismissal of the Princes from the Army. Although the Theotokis government had increased supplies of arms and munitions, he had also reinstated Crown Prince Constantine, who had led the Army in the 1897 war, as Chief Inspector of the Army. Also, despite demands, he had authorised only a few officers to pursue further studies in France and Germany.
Army action.
The Military League, now numbering about 1,300, began by engaging in a form of lobbying by putting pressure on those in power. It had already scored a success with the July 1909 resignation of Theotokis, its "bête noire" and a symbol of the parliamentary clientelism it hated. But his successor Dimitrios Rallis immediately alienated the League by paying tribute to Constantine’s major role in the war of 1897, by recalling all officers present in Macedonia, by demanding Great Power intervention in Crete and by arresting over a dozen of the League's members for insubordination on 12 August.
The arrest of League officers precipitated events: either the League would act now, or it would be dissolved by a government. The League searched for support among the senior officers, and Colonel Nikolaos Zorbas was chosen as its figurehead. On 14 August, Pangalos liberated two of the arrested officers, thereby provoking Rallis into ordering a clampdown and the arrest of all league members.
On the same night, the League set in motion its bloodless coup. The League members were gathered in the Goudi barracks: several hundred junior officers, non-commissioned officers, simple soldiers, gendarmes and civilians threatened to march on Athens if their demands were not met. The armed forces, in particular the young officers, sent Rallis’ government a pronunciamento containing their demands (the previous day, Rallis had declined to receive a deputation seeking to hand over the manifesto). Part of it was purely internal in nature: for instance, the soldiers challenged the promotion system, with its limited prospects for advancement. Another part was political and demanded profound reforms in the country: in its political functioning, as well as social, economic and military. The troops called for naval and land rearmament, and asked that the Navy and War ministers belong to the military. The insurgents did not call for the King’s abdication or the abolition of the monarchy, remaining loyal subjects. Neither did they announce a military dictatorship or even wish to change the government. They respected the institutions of parliamentary government. However, the officers did demand that the royal princes, chiefly the Crown Prince Constantine, on whom they blamed the defeat of 1897, be relieved of their posts and expelled from the army. Finally, the League called for a lowering of tax burdens.
The prime minister opened "pro forma" negotiations with the revolutionaries who, in order to speed them up, resorted to the people of Athens.
Popular demands.
A large popular demonstration, organised and supervised by the soldiers, took place in the streets of Athens on 14 September 1909. The demonstrators, who had come from Athens and the Piraeus, demanded the imposition of a revenue tax, protectionism, the granting of tenure to bureaucrats (so they would no longer depend on politicians for their jobs), better working conditions and the condemnation of usury. King George I, unwilling to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor Otto, who had been forced from the throne under similar circumstances in 1862, pushed Prime Minister Rallis to resign and replaced him with Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis.
Stalemate.
The negotiations dragged on, and Colonel Zorbas lacked the political skills to keep up with the seasoned veterans on the government side. Mavromichalis, in securing passage of a large number of mildly reformist bills, implemented part of the programme demanded by the Military League, this time under threat of an actual military takeover. Thus, the general staff was reorganised and those close to Constantine (such as Ioannis Metaxas) were removed while budget cuts were made in order to finance army modernisation. But his government clearly showed that the old system endured: only Finance Minister Athanasios Eftaxias had reformist ideas. With the revolution running out of steam, the League began to crumble. It was not a real political movement: its ideology and programme lacked coherence; its leaders were popular but unskilled. They were above all soldiers ill at ease outside their barracks. The League had known how to link its corporatist demands to public discontent by using populist and nationalist slogans, but it unsettled the bourgeoisie. Although it saw the necessity of modernising the country, the middle classes feared the drift towards a military dictatorship, considered deleterious to the normal progress of affairs.
The appeal to Venizelos.
Some of the officers went to Crete, which they knew well, either from having participated in the earlier events or in the formation of its civil guard during the period of autonomy. There, they had also been able to see the political talents of the man who had been Prime Minister of Crete since 9 May 1909: Eleftherios Venizelos. When Prince George of Greece was High Commissioner of Crete, he had found himself in opposition to Venizelos. This gave the latter an anti-dynastic aura that attracted the Goudi insurgents; he was also seen as free from association with the mainland oligarchy’s chaos, corruption and incompetence. Starting in October 1909 they had sent him an emissary to sound out his intentions, also suggesting to him that he take the office of Prime Minister of Greece. However, Venizelos did not wish to appear as the soldiers’ man, either in Greece or abroad. Neither did he wish to clash head-on with King George I and the “old” political parties. He thus advised them to proceed with legislative elections and entrust implementation of the reform programme to the new assembly. He went to Athens on and was greeted in Piraeus harbour by eager officers. In January, a Crown Council gathered together the main leaders of the political movements, under the aegis of the King and of Venizelos. The latter played the role of mediator between the forces present: the King, the government, the parliament, the troops and the people. The solutions proposed by the Cretan prime minister were adopted: the convocation of an assembly tasked with constitutional revision; and the resignation of the Mavromichalis government, to be replaced with a transitional government that would organise legislative elections. Leadership of the transitional government was given to Stephanos Dragoumis, considered an “independent”. Nikolaos Zorbas was made Minister of Land Forces. In exchange, Venizelos managed to convince the Military League to dissolve itself so as not to hinder the political process. In March 1910, an initially reluctant sovereign called new elections; three days later, the League announced its dissolution. Venizelos went back to Crete.
Using his Cretan citizenship as a pretext (the island had declared union with Greece but Greece had yet to recognise this), Venizelos did not take part in the elections, held in August 1910. His allies nominated him for a seat in Atticoboeotia but he stayed away from the electoral campaign. He was on a diplomatic tour of Western Europe when he learned that he had been elected and that deputies allied to him had obtained a relative majority with 146 of 362 seats. He thus returned to Athens amid rapturous public acclaim; the Dragoumis government resigned and Venizelos became prime minister in October 1910. He surrounded himself with collaborators bent on reform policies and began to apply the programme of the Goudi revolutionaries, strongly backed by public opinion. The Austrian ambassador observed on 28 October 1910: “Venizelos is a sort of popular tribune and almost the dictator of Greece. The enthusiasm of the people, who acclaim him everywhere, is striking”. He decided to call immediate new elections in order to strengthen his majority: the assembly elected in August continued to be dominated by the old politicians. These took place on . Venizelos was careful to present himself as an adversary of the “old” parties (which boycotted the elections), but also as free from influence by the Military League that had sought him out after the Goudi coup. Thus he did not hesitate to take as an aide-de-camp Ioannis Metaxas, a "bête noire" of the League whom it had removed. Venizelos’ Liberal Party won the elections with an overwhelming majority of 300 out of 362 deputies.
Reformist policies.
The reforms of the Venizelos government were numerous, and allowed Greece to modernise and thus be better prepared for the Balkan Wars and World War I. The King supported them, seeing in his prime minister the best hope of stemming the anti-dynasticism that had surfaced in 1897 and gained renewed momentum in the 1908-1909 crisis.
To the people who wanted the assembly elected in 1910 to be a constituent assembly, Venizelos replied that he considered it more of a "revisionary assembly". The fifty constitutional amendments of 1911, prepared by a commission directed by Stephanos Dragoumis, led to the frequently expressed opinion that after this date, Greece had an entirely new fundamental law, the Greek Constitution of 1911. This revision reformed the status of property by allowing for expropriation in the national interest, opening up the possibility of land reform; were distributed to 4,000 farm families in Thessaly. Agricultural education was encouraged, as well as farming cooperatives, a Ministry of Agriculture was created and an agronomist named in each region. Bureaucrats were given greater security of tenure and hiring for civil service posts began to be done by public examination. Judges were protected by a Superior Magistracy Council. Social legislation ameliorated the condition of the working class: child labour was abolished, as was nighttime labour by women, and a minimum wage introduced for both; Sunday was made an obligatory day of rest; primary education was made free and compulsory; and a social insurance system was created. The right of labour unions to function was recognised. Stabilisation of the drachma once again allowed for foreign borrowing. The state budget showed a surplus in 1911 and 1912 after many years of deficit, and tax evasion was curbed. The tax on sugar was cut by 50% and a progressive income tax introduced. Taken together, the reforms helped neutralise the development of strong socialist and agrarian movements seen elsewhere in the Balkans in that period. The army and navy were reorganised with help from France, which sent a military mission led by General Eydoux (Germany had reformed the Turkish Army). The navy was reorganised by a British mission that Admiral Tufnell headed. However, Venizelos, anxious to show that he was no military puppet, excluded soldiers from political life, released officers arrested for attempting to thwart the Goudi coup, and restored to Crown Prince Constantine (given the new post of inspector-general of the army), along with his brothers, their army posts. This angered the members of the defunct Military League, who for a time thought of recreating it; indeed of carrying out another coup.

China Earthquake Administration

The China Earthquake Administration (CEA), () is mandated by the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Protecting Against and Mitigating Earthquake Disasters of PRC" to enforce the earthquake administration in the nation under the administration of State Council of the People's Republic of China.
Some English text use the name Chinese Seismic Bureau (CSB). In older text, it was also referred to by its former name, National Earthquake Bureau (NEB) or National Seismic Bureau (NSB).
Bureaus.
CEA presently has nine bureaus, two of which directly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
Establishment of the CEA.
As a country stricken by 2 of top 10 world's most fatal earthquakes before the creation of CEA, China's first seismic monitoring stations were set up under the Chinese Academy of Sciences. An national "Office of Earthquake Matters" was created under joint administration of the "National Science and Technology Commission" and Chinese Academy of Sciences after the 1966 Xingtai earthquake. A "Central Task Force of Earthquakes" (of the Chinese Communist Party) was created the day after a M7.4 earthquake struck Bohai Bay on July 18, 1969.
In 1971, the State Council decided to create the National Earthquake Bureau (CNEB), predecessor to CEA, to replace the "Central Task Force". The State Council initially delegated administration of the CNEB to the Chinese Academy of Sciences. CNEB became directly administrated by the State Councile in 1975.
Following the recommendation from the CNEB, each province, autonomous regions and centrally administrated municipalities in PRC has established its own earthquake bureau since 1977. In 1985, these local bureaus were placed under dual leadership of the local government and the national bureau.
CNEB was renamed CEA in 1998.

Die Wahrheit übers Lügen

Die Wahrheit übers Lügen ("The truth about lying") is the second album by Farin Urlaub Racing Team and the fourth album by Farin Urlaub.
As FURT was initially Farin Urlaub's live band, it was previously used on the live album "Livealbum of Death". This is the first studio album (being the third overall) in which Farin Urlaub incorporates his Racing Team.
The album was released with a short bonus album, "Ponyhof", just as "Jazz ist anders" was. "Büffelherde", the main album, consists of rock songs and on "Ponyhof", Farin experiments with reggae and ska songs. The main album, however, is quite short, with only 11 songs, which is rather unusual for Die Ärzte's and its members' solo albums since 1993.
"Die Wahrheit übers Lügen" was actually a title for a song, which was not completed in time. This was then chosen for the album title instead of another one, which was, according to Farin's friend, too boring.

Hurricane Joyce (2000)

Hurricane Joyce caused minor impact in the ABC and Windward islands during late September and early October 2000. The fourteenth tropical cyclone, tenth named storm, and sixth hurricane of the season, Joyce developed from a tropical wave located southwest of Cape Verde on September 25. Only twelve hours after becoming a cyclone, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Joyce early on September 26. Joyce continued to strengthen and became a hurricane by September 27. On the following day, Joyce peaked with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) on September 28. After peak intensity on September 28, unfavorable conditions caused Joyce to become disorganized and weaken. 
Late on September 29, Joyce was downgraded to a tropical storm while centered well east of the Lesser Antilles. In contrast with predictions, Joyce continued to weaken and became a tropical depression on October 1 while crossing through the southern Windward Islands. Early on the following day, Joyce degenerated into a tropical wave over the southeast Caribbean Sea. The remnants were monitored for regeneration, but never developed back into a tropical cyclone. Overall, impact from Joyce was minimal, limited to mainly rainfall and near-tropical storm force winds in Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados. The remnants of Joyce also caused similar effects on the ABC islands and Dominican Republic, which resulted in minor damage.
Meteorological history.
Hurricane Joyce originated from a tropical wave that emerged from the coast of Africa on September 22. Influenced by a powerful ridge that had developed in the wake of Hurricane Isaac, the wave traveled a brisk and slightly undulating westward path at . It would never change from that general path. While in the deep tropics of the open Atlantic, the wave began to show indications of a closed circulation. Satellite data was ambiguous, but the evidence favored the existence of a tropical cyclone, and the system was designated Tropical Depression Fourteen. At the next advisory, the cyclone was upgraded and named "", although satellite data was still ambiguous about whether Joyce even had a circulation.
Joyce headed westward and steadily intensified. Deep convection and outflow improved, and Joyce gradually developed an eye. On September 27, it was upgraded to a hurricane with cold cloud tops. Early on September 28, Joyce peaked in intensity with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h), a central pressure of , and a fleeting "pinhole" eye. At the time, it was located about midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles.
Wind shear then increased, partially exposing Joyce's center of circulation, although bursts of convection remained. Convection and organization slowly deteriorated, and became, early on September 29, "pretty crummy" and without a well-defined center of circulation. Joyce did manage to remain at hurricane intensity through this time. Due to the disorganization, it was downgraded to a tropical storm later that day. Despite occasional bursts of convection, Joyce weakened into a tropical depression as it crossed the Windward Islands on October 1. The weakening was confirmed by Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance flights. After crossing the Windward Islands, and entering the southeastern Caribbean Sea, Joyce unexpectedly degenerated into an open wave. Although Joyce's remnants were monitored for regeneration, any possible redevelopment never materialized.
Joyce dissipated in an area of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. The National Hurricane Center attributed the weakening to dry air from the Sahara. The dry air may have been caused by a lack of southwesterlies bring moisture from equatorial areas, and continental influence from South America.
Forecasting, impact, and naming.
Joyce's track was well forecast, with errors ten to twenty percent smaller than the ten-year average. In general, Joyce persistently stayed south of where it was forecast to be. By contrast, intensity forecasts had large errors. Indeed, at 0900 UTC on October 2 Joyce was forecast to be a tropical storm three days out, when in reality the storm dissipated six hours later. These forecast errors were blamed on Joyce's surprise dissipation. Regarding potential impacts, Joyce's storm surge of on Trinidad was accurately forecast.
On September 30, a tropical storm watch was issued for the Windward Islands from St. Vincent and the Grenadines south to Trinidad and Tobago. One hour later, the watch was extended to Saint Lucia. Later that day, the watches were upgraded to warnings in Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada. On October 1, Trinidad's warning was downgraded to a watch. After that, the watches and warnings were gradually discontinued, first in Barbados and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, then Trinidad and Saint Lucia, then Tobago, and finally Grenada. In response to the approaching hurricane, emergency operations centers in Grenada and both main islands of Trinidad and Tobago were placed on alert.
While weakening, Tropical Depression Joyce passed close to Tobago, causing sustained winds of . Barbados experienced the highest sustained winds Joyce brought to any land area. There, the winds were , gusting to . Neither Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, nor Grenada reported serious effects from Joyce. Joyce caused storm surge of on southeast Trinidadian shores. After degenerating into an open wave, Joyce's remnants passed over the ABC Islands, where locally heavy thunderstorms and light winds were reported on October 2. A tropical wave related to Joyce's decay was blamed for flooding in the Dominican Republic, where rain caused the Mao, Amina, and Yaque del Norte Rivers to burst their banks, flooding thousands of hectares of banana and rice crops. Damage was reported in communities in the northeastern part of the country. No other impact was reported, and no deaths were blamed on Joyce.
Officials from Trinidad and Tobago reported that Joyce made landfall in that country. The National Hurricane Center differs, not attributing any landfall to Joyce. If Joyce really made landfall on Tobago, it would have been the first tropical storm to do so since 1990's Arthur. In addition, Joyce moved south of west for a time at a location where it is rare for tropical cyclones to do so.

The Fuller Brush Man

The Fuller Brush Man is a 1948 comedy film starring Red Skelton as a door-to-door salesman for the Fuller Brush Company who becomes a murder suspect.
Plot.
Success doesn't exactly stare the unfortunate street cleaner Red Jones (Red Skelton)in the eye, and when he decides to propose to his sweetheart Ann Elliot (Janet Blair), who is a secretary at the Fuller Brush company, she demands that he makes something more of himself before she can accept the offer. She suggests he should follow the example of a salesman and friend of hers, Keenan Wallick (Don McGuire), who works at her company. Red gets a chance to prove himself worthy sooner than he had expected when he is fired from his job as a cleaner by his boss, Gordon Trist (Nicholas Joy), because he accidentally sets a trash can on fire in the line of duty. Ann gets him a chance to show his skills as a door-to-door salesman for the Fuller Brush company, and he is teamed up with her friend Keenan. Both Ann and Red are unaware that Keenan himself had a romantic interest in Ann, and wants to get Red out of the way as soon as possible, so he can pursue Ann without competition. Keenan gives Red the hardest cases, and Red fails tremendously with his task of selling to an almost impossible potential customer. Seeing the result of Red's first attempts at the job as a salesman, Keenan comes up with the idea of a bet - the winner gets to pursue Ann without interference of the other man - which he suggests to Red. The bet is that Red won't be able to sell a single brush to the households on their run. Red takes the bet, and the next household on their run is his old boss Gorodon Trist's. Gordon recognizes Red and sends him packing almost immediately, bjt his wife comes after Red and buys ten brushes from him. Red returns to Anna and Keenan with high spirit, until he realizes he forgot to collect the payment money from Mrs Trist. When Red comes back to the Trist home, he happens to overhear a conversation between his former boss, Keenan, Gregory Cruckston (Donald Curtis) and a few other persons, as they discuss their involvement in a racketeering operation. Red is caught eavesdropping and knocked unconscious after he is brought into the house. When he comes back to life, Gordon has been murdered, and everyone present in the house is arrested by police lieutenant Quint (Arthur Space), suspected of murder. Red is released since there is no evidence pointing to him being the killer, and when he comes home he discovers Mrs Trist (Hillary Brooke) waiting for him with the money. Soon after, Anna arrives to his home, and shortly after that Freddie Trist (Ross Ford), Gordon's son, with two armed gangsters. The gangsters hold everyone hostage as they search for the murder weapon that killed Gordon. Ann and Red concludes that the weapon must have been a Fuller brush, molded into a knife-looking object. Cruckston stops them from telling policeman Quint about the weapon, and it turns out Cruckston, who is Gordon's partner in crime, is the murderer. Ann and Red escape from him and his gansters. Cruckston is arrested and Red is the hero of the day, winning Ann's heart in the process.
Production.
The project had been in development for four years. Producer Simon got permission from the Fuller Brush company and wrote the story with Skelton in mind but was unable to secure studio interest until the success of "Miracle on 34th Street" (1947) showed the benefits of commercial tie-ins for feature films. He set the project up at Columbia conditional upon MGM agreeing to loan him out. Producer Edward Small was owed a favour by MGM as he agreed not to make a film called "D'Artagnan" to clash with their production of "The Three Musketeers" (1948). Small and Simon then purchased a story in the "Saturday Evening Post" by Roy Huggins. Fuller Brush gave their final approval provided it was clear in the final movie that the character Skelton played was an independent dealer and not an employee of the Fuller Brush company.

St. Paul's Reformed Church (Startown, North Carolina)

St. Paul's Reformed Church is a building in Startown, North Carolina. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
St. Paul's Reformed Church
3562 Startown Road
Newton, NC 28658
828.465.0931
"Worship Times: 
Sundays- Sunday School 9:00AM Worship Service 10:00AM" 
1759 - 1903
St. Paul's Reformed Church dates its beginning to 1759. In that year, a German Reformed congregation and a Lutheran congregation, worshipping in the same building, called their first pastor: the Rev. James Martin, a Swiss Reformed pastor.
These German immigrants who made up the two congregations had arrived in this country seeking religious freedom and economic relief.
The historic building pictured was built in 1818 and is the oldest church structure west of the Catawba River.
1904 - 1974
This Reformed/Lutheran, union-church arrangement continued until 1904 when the Reformed congregation decided to relocate a few miles away to the Startown Community to be closer to the homes of its members. In Startown the Reformed congregation constructed a Victorian-style, one room church building. At this point in its history, St. Paul's was part of a four-church charge.
In 1937 The Reformed Church joined with the Evangelical Synod to form the Evangelical and Reformed Church. The Startown congregation was then referred to as St. Paul's E&R Church.
1975–present
In 1974, the congregation relocated again, one-half mile from the 1904 church, and built a new facility. The two-church arrangement continued with Bethel Church until 1978 when the St. Paul's congregation began supporting a full-time pastor on its own.
The congregation is nondenominational.
Two of the former buildings used by St. Paul's still stand today: the one constructed in the early 1800s (Old Conover Road, Newton) and the Victorian-style structure (Startown Road and Dove Street, Newton). Both of these older buildings are registered historic landmarks.

Infadels

Infadels were a London-based indie-electro band signed to the Wall of Sound record label. Their debut album, "We Are Not the Infadels", was produced by Jagz Kooner and released in January 2006. A second album, the Martin "Youth" Glover produced "Universe In Reverse", was released in June 2008. Their third album, "The Future of the Gravity Boy", has been released digitally on March 19, and physically on June 9 2012. The album is produced by DJ and electro artist Alex Metric & Matt Gooderson.
History.
Infadels were founded in 2003 by Alex Bruford (drums), Matt Gooderson (guitar, programming) and Bnann (vocals), who were joined shortly afterwards by Dead at Thirty founder Richie Vernon (live keys) and Wag Marshall-Page (Bass).
The band released two singles, "Leave Your Body" and "Can't Get Enough"/"Murder That Sound", on their own record label, Dead at Thirty. The awards for "Best Live Act" and "Best Dance Band" at the 2004 Diesel-U-Music Awards sealed a move to the Wall of Sound record label. 
In January 2005, the Infadels headed into the studio with producer Jagz Kooner to record their debut album, "We Are Not the Infadels". The band supported the release with an almost constant touring schedule with over 150 shows in 20 countries in 2006 alone. This included two UK tours, three European tours, two Australian tours, a number of shows in the USA & China and 35 festival dates.
The band's second album, "Universe In Reverse", was released in June 2008 and written largely by Bnann Watts and Matt Gooderson, and produced by Martin "Youth" Glover (Verve, Guns ’n’ Roses, Depeche Mode). "Play Blind", the first material from the second album, was given away for free as a limited-time download in February 2008. Next single "Make Mistakes", was released in April, and "Free Things For Poor People" was released in June 2008, reaching No. 1 on the UK Indie Singles Charts.
On Tuesday the 17th of June, the band threw several thousand pounds from an office window in central London in celebration of their own "Free Things Day". The day was brought to an early close when the band and their fans were cautioned by the police. On Monday the 19th of August they were voted best band at the 2008 Lowlands festival by the Dutch public ahead of Editors and N.E.R.D.
In November 2009 a new track, "Ghosts" was aired on Radio 1 by Alex Metric and backed up rumours of a return to the dance inspired sound of their debut album "We Are Not The Infadels". Following this, Alex Metric offered to produce their next record. In January 2010, the band confirmed that Metric would indeed be on production duties for new LP "The Future of the Gravity Boy".
The band released a video for "From Out Of The Black Sky" in July 2012.
This would be the last video the band would make, as on 1 September 2012 the band announced via Twitter that they had disbanded.

"Nichimgriff" ("Notundercontrol") is a song by Farin Urlaub Racing Team. It's the first single from Farin Urlaub's third solo studio album "Die Wahrheit übers Lügen".
For the whole Racing Team, this is the second single and as that, the first taste of what FURT sounds in studio, because the only previous single "Zehn" is from the live album "Livealbum of Death".
The song is about a man, who thinks he's perfect in every way and others are to blame for his faults; nobody pays him respect. Thus, he doesn't have his life under control.
The single was released on October 17.
Music video.
The video debuted on MTV Central in the show "TRL" on September 26.
It shows FURT performing in a gas station. A symbol from the album art of "Endlich Urlaub!", an orange jerrycan is seen throughout the song. A parallel storyline shows a young woman getting into an Opel Commodore A with a friend and then driving off, headbanging to the music. On the road, they pick up many different people and then all headbang together, till they drive into the gas station, which makes it blow up.

Big Book (thought experiment)

The "Big Book" is a thought experiment developed by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the nature of ethics and the verifiability of ethical knowledge. This account is given by him in an early work, the 1929 "Lecture on Ethics", and it matches also his position given in the early "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" (Proposition 6.41).
Summary of the experiment.
Wittgenstein's thought experiment goes as follows: Suppose there were an omniscient being who knew the position and movements of all of the physical bodies in the world (i.e. all of the natural properties of the world). Suppose further that this omniscient being wrote all of these natural facts in a large book, such that the book contained a thorough and comprehensive description of all of the things in the world. Wittgenstein argues that nothing in this book would even reference the idea of ethics or contain any statement that could logically be construed to imply an ethical judgment. His conclusion is that the concept of a moral fact is nonsensical, since even if one were to know every fact concerning the world that person still would not know anything factual about the realm of ethics.
In Wittgenstein's words.
"No statement of fact can ever be, or imply, a judgment of absolute value. Suppose one of you were an omniscient person and therefore knew all the movements of all the bodies in the world dead or alive and that you also knew all the states of mind of all human beings that ever lived, and suppose you wrote all you knew in a big book, then this book would contain the whole description of the world; and what I want to say is, that this book would contain nothing that we would call an ethical judgment or anything that would logically imply such a judgment."
Comparison to Wittgenstein's later positions.
Just four years later, in 1933, in another lecture on ethics at Cambridge University, Wittgenstein seems to have taken up a very different view. Instead of saying that ethical propositions would not be part of a complete account (or a complete "physical" account, at least) of the world, Wittgenstein said in the 1933 lecture that an ethical quality like "good" should be discoverable like any other quality, and that a full investigation of some action would reveal whether it had this quality or not.

Bertrand du Pouget

Bertrand du Pouget (Italian "Bertrando del Poggetto") (1280 – 3 February 1352) was a French papal diplomat and Cardinal.
Bertrand was born in Castelnau-Montratier. He may have been a nephew of Pope John XXII. As cardinal he was closely involved in dealing with the practical consequences of the migration of the papacy to Avignon, and also in striving to uphold papal prestige in Italy, for example by artistic commissions in Bologna. He expelled Galeazzo I Visconti, imperial vicar for Emperor Henry VII, from Piacenza and in 1329 arranged for a public burning of Dante's "De monarchia".
He was created cardinal priest of S. Marcello in 1316, and became bishop of Ostia in 1327. He participated in the conclave of 1334 that elected Pope Benedict XII and the conclave of 1342 that elected Pope Clement VI. He died at Villeneuve-lès-Avignon.

Katherine Corey

Katherine Corey (fl. 1660 – 1692) was an English actress of the Restoration era, one of the first generation of female performers to appear on the public stage in Britain. Corey played with the King's Company and the United Company, and had one of the longest careers of any actress in her generation. In "The humble petition of Katherine Corey" (see below), she stated that she "was the first and is the last of all the actresses that were constituted by King Charles the Second at His Restauration."
Correy started her career under her maiden name, Mitchell, but was Mrs. Corey by 1663. "Mrs Corey was a big woman with a gift for comedy. She was popular in a variety of roles, but especially in old women parts: scolding wives, mothers, governesses, waiting women, and bawds." In his Diary, Samuel Pepys, who admired Corey's talents, calls her "Doll Common" after her part in Ben Jonson's "The Alchemist".
In her three decades on the stage, Corey played a wide range of roles; in revivals of plays from the period of English Renaissance theatre:
— and in contemporary works, by John Dryden:
— and by William Wycherley:
— and Nathaniel Lee:
— and other authors:
— and many other parts, in plays by Edward Ravenscroft, Thomas Southerne, Thomas Shadwell, and others. Corey had a notable success as Strega, the title character in Thomas Duffet's "The Amorous Old Woman" in 1674. She played in other Duffet works too:
Corey's performance as Sempronia in "Catiline" was a focus of controversy. Nell Gwyn was quarrelling with the noblewoman Lady Elizabeth Harvey in 1669; Gwyn called the Lady a hermaphordite and claimed to have repulsed her lesbian advances. Gwyn also bribed and coached Corey into mimicking Harvey in her role as Sempronia. Lady Harvey hired thugs to hiss Corey onstage and throw oranges at her. The matter caused a major scandal. Lady Harvey prevailed upon the Lord Chamberlain (her cousin Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester) to arrest Corey and interrogate her; but Harvey's rival Lady Castlemaine got the King to release the actress. (Gwyn and Lady Harvey later became friends).
In the Spring of 1689, Mrs. Corey became involved in an attempt by some actors in the United Company to form an independent troupe under the management of Henry Killigrew. When that effort failed, manager Charles Killigrew would not allow Corey back into the United Company; she appealed to the Lord Chamberlain, with the "humble petition" cited above, to be re-admitted, and won re-instatement.
She continued to act a variety of parts —
— and others during the final phase of her career. (Though in her 1689 "humble petition" to the Lord Chamberlain, she noted that she was never paid more the 30 shillings a week.)
As one of the earliest actresses with the King's Company, Corey has been nominated as a possibility for the honour of the "first English actress," who played Desdemona in 8 December 1660 performance of "Othello". Most commentators, however, think Corey's lack of physical beauty makes her an unlikely Desdemona, and prefer Margaret Hughes or Anne Marshall for the distinction.

<doc id="19407815" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19407815" title="Kingdom of Namayan">
Kingdom of Namayan

The ancient Kingdom of Namayan (also called the "Kingdom of Sapa, Maysapan" or "Nasapan", and sometimes "Lamayan" - both references to its capital) was one of three major kingdoms that dominated the banks of the Pasig River and the coast of Laguna de Bay in the Philippines prior to the Spanish conquest in the 16th century.
Namayan is said to be the oldest of the three kingdoms, predating the kingdoms of Tondo and Maynila. Formed by a confederation of barangays, it is said to have achieved its peak in 1175.
Historical record.
Much of what is known about precolonial Namayan is based on ""Estado Geográfico, Topográfico, Estadístico, Histórico-Religioso de la Santa y Apostólica Província de San Gregorio Magno"", published in 1865 by Franciscan scholar Fr. Felix de Huerta. His description of Namayan included important details such as the extent of Namayan's territories, and the lineage of its rulers.
Capital Sites.
Three present-day locations are identified as the political centres of Namayan. Two of these are within today's Santa Ana, Manila, and the other is now a barangay of the Mandaluyong City across the river from the other sites.
Sapa.
The site most associated with the kingdom is the town proper of Santa Ana, which grew around the Our Lady of the Abandoned Parish. This site did not become the centre of the settlement until 1578, when Franciscan missionaries chose to build the parish church of Santa Ana de Sapa some distance away from the original town. Local referred to the site as ""Maysapan"", or more simply, ""Sapa.""
"Sapa" is the Modern Tagalog word for a small creek. Nearby bodies of water matching the description include what would eventually be called Estero de Tripa de Gallina, and a smaller creek in the vicinity of what are now Del Pan, Havana, and Tejeron streets. However, old Santa Ana was known for being "criss-crossed by brooks and creeks", and any number of these creeks could have been obscured by eventual urbanization.
Christianised into "Santa Ana de Sapa", the name eventually encompassed the district of the City of Manila now known as Santa Ana. Fr. de Huerta notes that ""this town takes its name from the titular saint and the addition of Sapa for its having been established in a site immediately upon an estuary or rivulet proceeding from the Pasig River, which the natives call "Sapa" and the name of the town itself.""
Lamayan.
Instead of the Nasapan site, local traditions say that an area called "Lamayan" (Tagalog for "the place where a wake was held"), on the banks of the Pasig itself. It was the site of the ancient capital from which Lakan Tagkan and Buwan once ruled. It is still recognisable today because the modern street still bears its name.
Barangay Namayan, Mandaluyong.
A third location, Barangay Namayan in the City of Mandaluyong bears the name of the kingdom, and was clearly part of its ancient territory, located as it is on the banks of the Pasig just opposite of Lamayan.
Territory.
Namayan's territory has been described bordering Manila Bay, the Pasig river, and Laguna de Bay. A more precise description of Namayan's administrative area is given by Fr. de Huerta, who, noting that Namayan was a confederation of several barangays, identified these component communities as they were named during the mid 19th century.
Most are now districts or barangays within the modern City of Manila:
Four settlements are now separate cities in and around Metro Manila:
Administrative and political records of Spanish Manila indicate that these settlements mentioned as territories of the Kingdom of Sapa were recorded in 1578 as parts and "visitas" (satellite settlements) of Sta. Ana de Sapa.
A number of these settlements' names are no longer used today, but Philippine National Artist for Literature Nick Joaquin, in his book "Manila My Manila: A History for the Young", says that the kingdom's territories included what are now Santa Ana, Quiapo, San Miguel, Sampaloc, Santa Mesa, Paco, Pandacan in Manila; Mandaluyong, San Juan, Makati, Pasay, Pateros, Taguig, and Parañaque.
Rulers.
Fr. Huerta also recorded the history of Namayan's rulers. It had been ruled from Sapa by Lakan Tagkan (also spelt Lacatagcan, Takhan), and Lady Buan. Their known issue was five individuals of whom the principal was named Palaba. Palaba sired a son named Laboy who, in turn, had a son named Calamayin whose own son was christened "Martín" when he converted to Catholicism.
Of perhaps greater interest, however, is Tagkan's child by his Bornean slave-wife. The child, named "Pasay", inherited the territory known today the barangays of Pio del Pilar and Bangkál (formerly known as Barrio Culi-culi), Baclaran, and the modern city which still bears the name of this individual. There is, however, some disagreement as to whether Pasay was a son or daughter, with some legends bestowing the title ""Dayang-dayang" ("princess") on Pasay.
After colonisation.
When the parish of Sta. Ana de Sapa was founded in 1578, Franciscan missionaries chose to build their church, and eventually another settlement, some distance away from the ancient town. The result is that the present-day Santa Ana is no longer located at the original site of the capital of Namayan. This has raised some questions about pre-colonial graves that have recently been excavated near the Santa Ana church.
During the Spanish colonial era, Santa Ana was reduced to a fishing village that had other industries including carpentry, masonry, piña (pineapple cloth) embroidery, as well as the production of "tinapâ", cigars, bricks, sugar, and bread.

Left Review was a journal of the Writers' International established in 1934 and continued until 1938.
"Left Review's" editorial board was headed by Montagu Slater, Edgell Rickword, Amabel Williams-Ellis, Tom Wintringham and Randall Swingler.
The first issue published a position statement by the Writers' International, declaring Britain's economy and culture were in a state of collapse, and invited responses. The issues that followed published responses, such as the one by Lewis Grassic Gibbon in the February 1935 issue, and opinions on the nature of literature. In 1937 "Left Review" was subject to criticism after
Fredric Warburg revealed in a letter to "The New Statesman" that "Left Review" had refused to carry an advertisement for John Dewey's book "The Case of Leon Trotsky", which published the report of 
the Dewey Commission which had defended Trotsky from attacks made on him during 
Stalin's show trials. In response, Randall Swingler defended the decision not to carry the advertisement,
stating 
""there is a line at which criticism ends and destructive attacks begin, and we regret that this line separates us both from Dr. Goebbels and from Leon Trotsky."".

<doc id="19408100" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19408100" title="Timothy Stoen">
Timothy Stoen

Timothy Oliver Stoen (born January 16, 1938), is best known for his central role as a member of the Peoples Temple, and as an opponent to the group during a multi-year custody battle over his six-year-old son, John. Stoen's battle led to an investigation of the Peoples Temple's settlement at Jonestown, Guyana, which became internationally notorious in 1978 after 918 people—including Stoen's son—died in the settlement and on a nearby airstrip. Stoen continues to work as a deputy district attorney in Mendocino County, California, where he is assigned to the District Attorney's Fort Bragg office.
Early life.
Stoen was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin., the child of religious middle-class parents from Littleton, Colorado. Throughout high school and college he was a scholar, athlete and devout Christian. He graduated from Wheaton College with a B.A. in Political Science.
Stoen graduated from Stanford Law School in 1964 and was admitted to the California bar in 1965. Stoen worked for a year in an Oakland real estate office before joining the Mendocino County District Attorney's office in Ukiah, California in 1965 as a Deputy District Attorney.
In 1967, Stoen left the district attorney's office with the intention of doing work for flower children in San Francisco's Haight Ashbury district., and also worked as a staff attorney for the Legal Aid Society of Alameda County. Though he represented black militants and supported an ecological platform, he briefly considered running for office as a Republican.
In 1970, Stoen married Grace Lucy Grech, whom he had met at march at the San Francisco Civic Center against overpopulation and pollution. Their son, John Victor Stoen, was born on January 25, 1972.
Temple beginnings.
Introduction to Peoples Temple.
Stoen first encountered the Peoples Temple when it was suggested that he ask the group to help renovate the Mendocino County legal aid offices. Two dozen Temple volunteers showed up the following Sunday, and Stoen began sending people to the Temple for drug and marriage counseling.
Stoen became impressed with Temple leader Jim Jones' character and good deeds, especially when he saw Jones scrubbing toilets in the Temple building himself. Stoen also was impressed that Jones and his wife were the first Caucasian couple to adopt a black child in Indiana. Stoen and Jones became personal friends and Stoen drove to Redwood Valley to attend Temple services. By the end of 1969, when violence erupted in Berkeley over People's Park and Third World students' rights, Stoen began to integrate his personal life with the Temple.
In 1970, Stoen moved to the Temple's headquarters in Ukiah, where he worked as a deputy district attorney and head of Mendocino County's civil division. Stoen began providing legal aid for the Temple and politically converted to the Temple's socialism vision.
San Francisco Assistant District Attorney.
Former San Francisco District Attorney Joseph Freitas named Stoen to lead the special unit to investigate election fraud charges. Shortly thereafter, San Francisco District Attorney Freitas then hired Stoen as an assistant district attorney in the consumer frauds division.
Ironically, Temple members later alleged that the Temple arranged for "busloads" of members to be bused from Redwood Valley to San Francisco to vote in these election under threats of physical violence. When asked how Jones could know for whom they voted, one member responded "You don't understand, we wanted to do what he told us to." Stoen later claimed that he was not aware at the time of voter fraud, despite being in charge of the city's election fraud special unit, but that it could have happened without his knowledge because "Jim Jones kept a lot of things from me."
Defection from the Peoples' Temple.
On February 6, 1972, just two weeks after his son John was born, Stoen signed an affidavit in which he stated that John's father was Reverend Jim Jones. The single-page document eventually became the most important piece of paper in the Temple’s history. Stoen's affidavit not only seemed to contradict his putative paternity, but also “bound the child to Jones and the church for life.” In the years to follow, Jones would cite the affidavit countless times to demonstrate his paternity of the child, to denigrate Grace’s worthiness to be a mother, and to dismiss Stoen’s claims of custody rights.
Stoen's wife Grace, meanwhile, had grown to greatly dislike the Temple. She had given up her son John to have him raised communally, based on her husband's affidavit. She had also been berated in Planning Commission meetings for denying that Jim Jones was John's father, watched John be paddled in Temple proceedings, listened to Jones portray her husband Tim as a homosexual, had Jones wave a gun at her in Planning Commission meeting threatening to shoot her if she fell asleep, and witnessed the beating of a 40-year-old woman who had claimed the Temple turned members into robots. Grace and Temple member Walter Jones, known as Smitty, agreed to leave together. In July 1976, Grace and Smitty fled to Lake Tahoe.
Grace was unable to take her young son with her; John was thousands of miles away in Guyana, and she did not want to put John’s life in jeopardy along with hers. Nevertheless, she began to fight for custody almost immediately after her defection. In February 1977, Grace threatened to legally divorce Tim. Fearing that possible legal action against Stoen would make the custody dispute public, Jones sent him to Jonestown. Stoen quit his job as assistant district attorney and began working in Guyana, both at Jonestown and at the Temple's headquarters in Georgetown. However, distrusting Temple members were secretly spying on Stoen and examining the contents of his briefcase. Within a year, Stoen also left the church, returned to San Francisco, and joined Grace's custody battle. When Stoen defected, he became Jones' chief antagonist, and Jones encouraged his Jonestown residents to write detailed, humiliating fantasies about killing Stoen.
Battling the Temple.
In one sense, John "represented the most visible symbol in the battle between Jim Jones and the Concerned Relatives organization." If Jones were forced to surrender John, he would have lost his claims of absolute power of protection for his followers.
White Nights.
In July 1977, Jones moved several hundred Temple members to Jonestown to escape building pressure from media investigations. That same night, an editor at "New West" magazine read Jones a pending article, written by Marshall Kilduff, detailing allegations by former Temple members. Most politicians had broken ties with Jones by that point, although some local politicians, including Willie Brown, Harvey Milk and Art Agnos, were still supporting him.
In September 1977, a Georgetown court ordered the Temple to show cause why a final order should not be issued compelling the return of John to his mother. A few days later, the same court issued a second order for Jones' arrest.
In fear of being held in contempt of the court orders, and in an attempt to further manipulate his followers, Jones staged a false sniper attack on himself and began a series of "White Night" rallies, called the "Six Day Siege", where Jones told Temple members about attacks from outsiders and had members surround Jonestown with guns and machetes. Angela Davis and Huey Newton communicated via radio-telephone to the Jonestown crowd, urging them to hold strong against the "conspiracy." Jones made radio broadcasts stating "we will die unless we are granted freedom from harassment and asylum." Deputy Minister Ptolemy Reid finally assured Jones' wife Marceline that Guyanese Defense Forces would not invade Jonestown. The Guyana clerk refused to sign an arrest warrant for Jones, and there was talk of government interference in the legal process.
After this initial round of the Stoen custody dispute, Jones directed Temple members to write over a dozen foreign governments inquiring about their immigration policies, in the event that they had to flee Guyana. He also wrote the U.S. State department, inquiring about North Korea and Stalinist Albania.
Concerned Relatives press for action.
Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the Stoens and other relatives of Jonestown members began attending meetings at the home of Jeannie Mills. The group began calling themselves the "Concerned Relatives." They shared details of their encounters with the Temple, interviewed Temple defectors, and reviewed short wave radio transcripts of communications between Jonestown and the Temple's San Francisco headquarters. Temple surveillance teams, aware of these meetings, checked license plates in front of Mills' house to determine the identity of their "enemies." Stoen's addition to the group was vital because of his knowledge of Temple operations, his letter-writing campaigns to the Secretary of State and the government of Guyana, and his travels to Washington to spearhead an investigation. Stoen became the Concerned Relatives' primary legal representative, and filed four court actions against the Temple and its leadership on November 18, 1978 on the group's behalf.
Finally, after pressing for legal action in the United States, in November 1977, an order was issued in a San Francisco court granting custody of John to his mother, Grace. The court order meant that Jones could not return to the United States without facing contempt proceedings for failing to turn over the child; it also meant John could never leave Jonestown.
In January 1978, Stoen traveled to Georgetown to take custody of the child, but he was unsuccessful. The Guyanese judge recused himself from the case because his life had been threatened, and a new judge had to restart the process from the beginning. A Guyanese official approached Stoen and told him to leave immediately, one week before his visa expired. While at the airport, three Temple members surrounded Stoen and threatened his life unless he dropped his legal action. Although Stoen wanted to travel to Jonestown to retrieve John, he thought "if I went back, I thought I would probably be a corpse within 30 days."
After Stoen returned to Washington D.C. from Georgetown in January 1978, he visited with nine congressmen, including Leo Ryan. The Temple, likewise, sent members to visit eight of the nine Congressman in order to discredit Stoen.
Stoen also wrote a "white paper" to Congress that stated how Jim Jones was illegally holding his son. The white paper claimed that any action by the Guyanese Army to retrieve the child could result in harm to John or others, and insisted that members of Congress write Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham to take action. Congressman Leo Ryan's interest was aroused by the Stoen custody fight and he wrote such a letter on Stoen's behalf. Several Congressmen also wrote Burnham about Stoen's concerns.
At the end of January 1978, Stoen and fellow Concerned Relative Steven Katsaris met with State Department officials. Stoen insisted that Jones' mental condition was deteriorating and that he was suffering from "paranoid megalomania." He urged that the State Department move Guyana to "speedily enforce" the custody orders that the Stoens had won.
Media spotlight.
Feeling the international pressure, on February 17, 1978, Jones submitted to an interview with "San Francisco Examiner" journalist Tim Reiterman over a radio-telephone. Reiterman's story about the Stoens' custody battle appeared in the Examiner's February 18 preview edition of that Sunday's paper.
The article undermined Jones' credibility as well as the Temple's reputation, and made most former supporters more suspicious of the Temple's claim that it was being subjected to a "rightist vendetta." Temple attorneys immediately sent a letter to the Examiner, stating "this is the straw that broke the camel's back" and "we . . will litigate." The Temple also sent the February 6, 1972 affidavit that Stoen had signed, claiming that Jim Jones was his son's real father, which Herb Caen reprinted in his San Francisco Chronicle column.
The next day, February 19, 1978, San Francisco Board of Supervisor member Harvey Milk wrote a letter to President Jimmy Carter supporting Jones. The Temple had assisted Milk's 1976 election race to become a California State assembly member, and Milk had visited and spoken at Temple rallies. In the letter to President Carter, Milk wrote "Rev. Jones is widely known in the minority communities and elsewhere as a man of the highest character... Timothy and Grace Stoen the parties attempting to damage Rev. Jones reputation". Milk also wrote "[it is outrageous that Timothy Stoen could even think of flaunting this situation in front of Congressman with apparent bold-faced lies." The letter insisted that "the actions of Mr. Stoen need to be brought to a halt. It is offensive to most in the San Francisco community and all those who know Rev. Jones to see this kind of outrage taking place." 
Affidavits and lawsuits.
On March 14, 1978, Temple member Pam Moten sent an open letter to Congress, suggesting that members of the Concerned Relatives group were conspiring with the FCC and IRS against the Temple. It stated "radical Trotskyite elements which defected from our organization when we refused to follow their violent course have been orchestrating a campaign against us." Moten's letter suggested that Soviet overtures to assist the Temple might embarrass the U.S.: "n fact, several overtures have been made from Russia, which sees our current harassment as a form of political persecution. We do not want to take assistance from any people nor do we want to become an international issue."
On April 11, 1978, the Concerned Relatives distributed a packet of documents, including letters and affidavits that they titled an "Accusation of Human Rights Violations by Rev. James Warren Jones" to the Peoples Temple, members of the press and members of Congress. The accusations chronicled mistreatment in Jonestown, which it portrayed as an armed camp, and described hard labor, passport confiscation and statements about Jones' speeches speaking of suicide and conspiracies against the Temple.
On May 10, 1978, the Peoples Temple retorted with their own "Open Statement" alleging the Concerned Relatives were part of a massive conspiracy and attacking the "so called Free Enterprise system" and "racist" "corporate power." It portrayed the Concerned Relatives as just the "latest ploy" of a larger conspiracy that was "growing desperate" and had a "total inability to understand the dynamics of a collective unit." It further portrayed the group as lying and attempting to "destroy us."
In June 1978, Deborah Layton and her attorney drafted a further affidavit detailing alleged crimes by the Peoples Temple and substandard living conditions in Jonestown.
Stoen and other Concerned Relative members had monitored Temple shortwave radio broadcasts, and Stoen filed complaints with the FCC in the Fall of 1977 for Temple regulation violations. In later affidavits and lawsuits filed in 1978, Stoen cited communications the group had intercepted through their monitoring. Stoen also acted as the lawyer in three different lawsuits filed in May and June 1978 on behalf of members of the Concerned Relatives against Jones and other Temple members collectively seeking over $56 million in damages.
On July 10, 1978, the Temple sued Stoen for $150 million, charging that Stoen violated his attorney-client relationship with the Temple by using privileged information in his suits against the Temple. Charles R. Garry represented the Temple in the suit. The suit alleged that Stoen was attempting to "harass and oppress" his former client and sought to enjoin Stoen from soliciting former members as clients in suits against the Temple.
Final trip.
By October 1978, all of the defectors had allied with Stoen and the Concerned Relatives. On October 3, Stoen told the State department that he would retrieve John from Jonestown by force if necessary. Three days later he sent a telegram reiterating the threat and warning of the danger of mass suicide at Jonestown.
After pressure grew, the Temple learned that Stoen would accompany a Congressional investigatory trip by Leo Ryan to Guyana. On November 15, 1978, Grace and Tim Stoen both traveled with the Ryan delegation to Georgetown. However, they were not permitted to accompany the delegation on its November 17 trip to the Temple settlement at Jonestown.
While the Stoens remained in Guyana, the Ryan delegation was attacked on November 18 at an airstrip near Jonestown. Congressman Ryan and four others were killed at the airstrip by Temple members wielding rifles and shotguns, while several others were injured.
Tim Stoen encountered Jim Jones' son Stephan in his Georgetown hotel, neither knowing that the killings were unfolding two hundred miles away. As they spoke, 909 inhabitants of Jonestown, 276 of them children, died of apparent cyanide poisoning, mostly in and around a pavilion.
A recording of the final meeting, made by the Temple before the massacre, mentioned Stoen. Jones stated:
Jones also discussed whether the Temple should include Stoen among the names of those committing "revolutionary suicide", and whether to include children in the plan: 
Six-year-old John Stoen was found poisoned in Jim Jones' cabin. The incident at Jonestown was the greatest single loss of American civilian life in a non-natural disaster until the incidents of September 11, 2001.
Career after Jonestown.
From 1980 to 1984, Stoen was Corporate Counsel for Pacific Energy & Minerals, Ltd. For some time thereafter, Stoen worked at a private practice. In 1998, Stoen ran for the California State Senate and lost in the Democratic Party primary, receiving 34.5% of the party vote. On his political philosophy page, Stoen stated:
Later, Stoen returned to work for the district attorney's offices in Humboldt and Mendocino counties. Former Mendocino County District Attorney Norm Vroman, who hired Stoen back to the Ukiah office in 2000, stated "frankly, I've never seen him lose a case."

Jardin botanique E.M. Heckel

The Jardin botanique E.M. Heckel (12,000 m²), also known as the Jardin botanique de Marseille and the Jardin botanique Borély de Marseille, is a municipal botanical garden located in the Parc Borély at 48, Avenue Clot Bey, Marseille, Bouches-du-Rhône, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, France. It is open daily except Monday; an admission fee is charged.
Overview.
The garden is Marseille's fourth botanical garden. Its first was established by René of Anjou near the Abbaye Saint-Victor as the "Jardin botanique des Chartreux". The second was inaugurated in 1802 by Joséphine de Beauharnais and directed by M. Gouffé de la Cour, but disappeared in 1856 to make way for a railway. The garden was then re-established in the Parc Borély, on the site of today's rose garden, but was quickly judged too small by its director, Dr. Édouard Marie Heckel, and in 1913 additional land was purchased next to the park, to which the garden was relocated and named in his honor.
Today the garden contains over 3,500 species, arranged in a garden of medicinal plants, a traditional Chinese garden donated by the city of Shanghai in 2004, palmetum (palm garden), garden vines, garden of succulents, Mediterranean garden, and a Japanese garden. Of particular interest is a greenhouse containing nearly 300 species of South African flora.

He was an expert on laser tissue interactions and worked on eye tracking laser systems. Dr. Berger was also Chief of the Retina Service at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center.
Death.
Jeff was diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma on January 12, 2001 after only a week-long illness and died less than 2 weeks later on January 25, 2001. He is survived by his wife Karen and children Adina, Tamar and Joseph.
Legacy.
In just 37 years, Jeffrey Berger became a pioneer in his field and laid the groundwork for so many subsequent advances in the field of quantitative fundus imaging. Had he been able to continue his research, many of the questions that remain unsolved to this day might have been answered. Fortunately, his ideas and inspiration will live on in the knowledge that he has brought to this field. The legacy of Dr. Berger's research is further embodied in EyeIC Inc. (www.eyeic.com), a spinout from the University of Pennsylvania that is commercializing the MatchedFlicker(R) system based on his issued US patents.
Recognizing his strong commitment to mentoring students in medical research, the Jeffrey W. Berger Research Scholarship Fund, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit founded in 2003, sponsors the Jeffrey W. Berger Medical Student Research Award at the University of Pennsylvania. The award helps to fund students' research at Penn.

Döhne

Döhne is a South African agricultural research station 6 kilometers north of Stutterheim in the Eastern Cape. It is noted for having developed the Döhne Merino from Peppin Merino ewes and German mutton merino sires in 1939. The program bred for high fertility, rapid lamb growth and fine wool production under pastoral conditions. The breed was introduced to Australia in 1998.
On 24 September 1834, the Berlin Missionary Society's first South African mission station, Bethany, was founded on the Riet River between Edenburg and Trompsburg in the Orange Free State. With the arrival of more missionaries in 1837, the society expanded its work to the Eastern Cape and the Xhosa. Here Döhne played an important role in the founding of the stations Bethel and Itemba. These stations were abandoned during the Frontier War of 1846-47, when the missionaries found refuge in the neighbouring colony of Natal. With the closing of the Eastern Cape missions, the focus of the Berlin Missionary Society shifted to Natal and the Transvaal. Christianenberg, Emmaus and other mission stations were established there, and Döhne became a well-known figure among the Voortrekkers. In 1857 some German veterans of the Crimean War settled around Fort Döhne which had been built near the mission station. 
The Molteno government of the Cape Colony opened a railway station here in 1874, as part of its nationwide Cape Government Railways network. 
The settlement was named Döhne after Jacob Ludwig Döhne (1811–1879), the lexicographer and philologist from the Berlin Missionary Society, who was responsible for compiling "A Zulu-Kafir Dictionary" (Cape Town, 1857) after spending twenty years documenting the language and dialects, also translating the New Testament into Xhosa and Zulu.

Ricky van Wolfswinkel

Ricky van Wolfswinkel (; born 27 January 1989 in Woudenberg) is a Dutch footballer who plays as a striker for English Premier League team Norwich City. He has been capped twice by the Netherlands national football team. 
On 22 March 2013 it was announced that he had agreed a deal to join Norwich City for the 2013–14 season, a deal thought to be worth £8.5m.
While playing in Portugal he was nicknamed "O Lobo" (the Wolf), although during his early days in the Netherlands he was known as HatRicky because of the number of hat-tricks he scored.
Club career.
Vitesse.
Van Wolfswinkel started his football career at the D-pupils of Vitesse. In the A-juniors he became top scorer in the national first division. Because of that, he received a prize awarded by the KNVB. This prize was handed over by Wesley Sneijder in 2007. On 5 April 2008, Van Wolfswinkel made his debut for Vitesse's first team in a match against Sparta Rotterdam, in which Van Wolfswinkel was substituted in the 85th minute for Santi Kolk. Against De Graafschap, in the 2008–09 season, he was in the starting lineup for the first time. In his third match this season, against Sparta Rotterdam, Van Wolfswinkel scored his first Eredivisie goal.
FC Utrecht.
On 29 May 2009 he announced his leaving from Vitesse and signed a three years contract with FC Utrecht.
Van Wolfswinkel started the 2010–11 Eredivisie league with a goal in a 3–1 loss against Feyenoord. On 22 August 2010, he scored two goals against Willem II resulting in a 3–0 win for Utrecht. On 26 August 2010, Van Wolfswinkel scored a hat-trick against Celtic in the UEFA Europa League. Utrecht went on to win the match 4–0.
On 3 October 2010, Van Wolfswinkel scored two penalties against Ajax to gain a 2–1 away win over the Dutch runners-up.
Sporting Clube de Portugal.
On 3 June 2011 he moved to Sporting CP, signing a 5-year contract on a €5.4 million deal, the club signed him in a leverage by aid from Sporting Portugal Fund and Quality Sports Investments. He scored his first goal for Sporting on 10 September 2011 against Paços de Ferreira in a 3–2 win. On 15 September 2011 he scored in the 2–0 win against Zürich in the UEFA Europa League, scoring another goal on 19 September against Rio Ave, and two more five days later against Vitória de Setúbal. He scored another goal against Lazio on 29 September 2011. His impressive goal scoring form led to him being awarded the SJPF Player of the Month for September 2011. His goal scoring tally didn't stop there as he scored yet another two goals in a third round Taça de Portugal match against Famalicão. Overall, he scored 25 goals in all competitions during the 2011–12 season.
Norwich City.
On 23 March 2013, it was announced that Premier League side Norwich City had agreed to sign Van Wolfswinkel for €10 million plus up to €2 million in bonuses. He joined the Canaries on 1 July 2013 on a four-year deal. He revealed that Dutch legend Johan Neeskens had urged him to join Norwich saying "Ricky, you have to go. It's a great club for you, if you have a great feeling, do it". It was confirmed by the official Norwich City Twitter page that Van Wolfswinkel would be handed the number 9 shirt, previously worn by Grant Holt. He scored on his league debut on 17 August, rescuing a point for Norwich in a 2-2 home draw against Everton. In the aftermath of the match, he said in an interview that Manchester United and Netherlands international Robin van Persie also recommended Norwich to him. Van Persie had supposedly told Van Wolfswinkel that Norwich are "a difficult team to beat" and that the "crowd always get really behind them."
Van Wolfswinkel was involved in late controversy in a 0–0 home draw against Cardiff City on 26 October 2013. After team-mate Alexander Tettey went down injured, Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall sportingly put the ball out of play. Van Wolfswinkel quickly threw the ball to Leroy Fer who punted the ball into the open net. This caused outrage amongst the Cardiff players, who started shoving both Van Wolfswinkel and Fer. The goal was disallowed despite it not technically being a violation of any rules.
International career.
Van Wolfswinkel played several matches for the Netherlands' national youth sides in various age groups and in August 2010 was called up for the senior national team for a friendly against Ukraine, during which he made his senior debut. He earned his second full international cap against Indonesia in June 2013.

Ubiquitous Synergy Seeker

Ubiquitous Synergy Seeker (USS) is a musical duo that began working out of Parkdale, a neighbourhood situated in the west end of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The band is composed of vocalist, guitarist and erhu player Ashley Buchholz (aka Ash Boo-Schultz) and turntablist/hype man Jason "Human Kebab" Parsons.
The USS sound is a mixture of drum and bass beats, grunge-like guitar riffs and 2-step rhythms. "We like to call what we do the campfire after-party," Ash said, "It's like you're at Nirvana Unplugged but there's a drum and bass party and glow sticks all around you."
History.
USS hails from the outskirts of the Greater Toronto Area, Ash being from the city of Markham and Kebab from the adjacent town of Stouffville. They met in 2004, while stocking the beer fridge and discussing music when they worked at a golf course; the pair hit it off instantaneously. A couple of months later, Ash's sister was looking for someone to DJ at her upcoming wedding and Human Kebab was suggested for the job. "It was love at first scratch" Ash said, who later moved into Kebab's parents' basement to begin experimenting musically.
The band's name came about when Ash sketched out map of exactly who he wanted to be in life. At the top of this life-plan he wrote, "Ubiquitous Synergy Seeker." Although this title was to become the band’s moniker, the duo says that the name is for everyone: “It's singular — it's the title of a characteristic, not the title of two guys”, Ash said.
“Opportunity exists as a result of what you’re putting out to the world,” said Kebab.
By July 2008 they began to perform live, and they released their first independent EP, "Welding the C:/" (pronounced: Welding the C Drive) later that same month.
They hadn't predicted the success that was to follow the EP’s release. The band parted ways to pursue different avenues; Kebab went west, to the province of Alberta to work on an oil pipeline and Ash went south, to the US, on an emotional pilgrimage. Everything changed when a friend of Kebab's called to report that Toronto radio station 102.1 The Edge had put their first single, "Hollowpoint Sniper Hyperbole," into heavy rotation. The duo then returned to Toronto, to shoot their first video for "Hollowpoint Sniper Hyperbole" which was soon featured across Canada on the MuchMusic channel.
2010.
Just before the New Year, in Nov. of 2009, USS directly supported illScarlett, on the Canadian section of their 1UP! Tour.
Shortly after the destruction in Haiti took place, Toronto's alternative performers came together on Feb. 2, 2010, at The Sound Academy, for the 102.1 The Edge sponsored Toronto Plays For Haiti benefit. (Round two of the USS/Maestro mash-up happened at Wakestock 2010, in Collingwood, Ontario.)
March/April was all about the Highway to Health tour. USS headlined Western Canada, from Barrie to British Columbia, with The Stables, a Durham Region band, along for the ride as direct support.,
USS brought home their second consecutive COCA Award (Canadian Organization of Campus Activities) for Emerging Artist, (Winner of Emerging Artist Award 2009/2010), on June 25, 2010.
In September, Smirnoff launched their most ambitious “Be There” campaign ever, the Nightlife Exchange Project. The countries that participated, Canada, USA, Great Britain, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, India, Ireland, Lebanon, Poland, South Africa, Thailand and Venezuela all exchanged their culture with another country, and on Nov. 27, the world partied "together." USS were named as the Canadian curators, to deliver Canadian nightlife to India.
Human Kebab explains, "To truly experience Canadian nightlife, you need a curator that's all about its awesomeness, and we are honoured and proud to be asked by Smirnoff to accept this role. Having toured our great nation from coast to coast we have rocked hard with Canadians nightly for many years now, so we're stoked to fill our crate with every inch of our country and show our exchange city how it's done."
In October, mid-campaign, USS flew to Mumbai, India to truly experience the culture. Human Kebab spoke to Eye Weekly about the experience: “We started off by going to a few really well-known spots in Mumbai, like the Indus restaurant in the Hotel Diplomat, right beside the Taj Mahal Hotel, which of course was attacked by terrorists in 2008. We also saw the Leopold Café and Café Mondegar, which are their own version of what you might see here in North America. For the sake of the United Kingdom, we got to go to the Manchester United bar. And then we went to a club, a real hot spot for dance music called the blueFROG where you have to go through metal detectors to enter the bar, which was amazing and strange.” 
USS merged their progressive dance-folk flavour with eastern bad-boy Ashley MacIsaac’s fiery story-telling fiddle, and in November, USS released the single "Mavericks", a lyrical throwback to the notoriously dangerous big-break wave in Northern California. The single is riddled with underlying metaphors, asking the listener to realizing their own impossible task; "Mavericks" is Jeff Clark’s dream, applied to your own life (Clark is famous for surfing the wave for 15 years before it was widely discovered).
The stand-alone, "Mavericks," featuring Ashley MacIsaac, is available on iTunes and their merchandise website..
USS earned two spots on 102.1 The Edge’s top songs of 2010, with Anti-Venom at No. 26 and 3 Purple Butterflies at No. 74.
The wide scale audience singalongs and dancefloor pandemoniums are sure to continue. USS are singing and scratching up new storms, alongside producer Tawgs Salter (Lights, Elliot Yamin, Josh Groban). The studio's secluded sanctuary allows for frequent intermissions of wandering the woods, wishing on stars, and quiet moments of self-reflection.
2011.
In March 2011, the soundtrack to MLB 2K11 Major League Baseball 2K11, released by 2K Sports, includes USS' second single from Questamation, Anti-Venom.
USS’s new single, N/A OK, released on February, 14, 2011 - Valentine’s Day – across Canada. 102.1 The Edge, in Toronto was the first to jump on the trail, with legendary DJ Alan Cross once again supporting the band.
In an interview with Eye Weekly, Human Kebab elaborates on what USS has been working on:
“It’s amazing. We’re working with Tawgs Salter, who’s done records with Lights, The Midway State and Josh Groban, and he’s been helping us define what the new USS is, from a songwriting perspective. We’re free to be quirky, acoustic, singer-songwriter, electronic turntable-based music, but in a bigger sounding format that has global aspirations. We’ve returned more to the minimal that we showed on our first EP, Welding The C:/, but we’re doing it with the right producer, to make it sound as big and powerful as we can be. At the start of the year we did a song with Ashley MacIsaac, and we followed that with what’s hopefully going to become our new EP.”
In an interview with Niagara Music Scene, Ash explains the EP's title: "Approved, because it seems like everyone has issues of self-worth. YOU'RE ALL GOOD ENOUGH! Most of life is just overcompensation for not feeling like you are good enough. APPROVED! 
The new EP entitled, “USS Approved,” was released digitally worldwide on May 3, 2011, the day of the album release party at Toronto's MOD Club + the kick-off date for the "USS Approved" Spring/Summer Cross-Canada tour. The physical copy is available exclusively in Canada, at the merch booth on tour or on their official site.
On Saturday August 20, USS played at Budweiser Canada's fifth annual Bud Camp.
On September 21, USS revealed their official live drummer, Matthew Murphy, at their Kingston, Ontario show.
By the end of summer 2011, the second single from their record "USS APPROVED" - Yo Hello Hooray (Everyday) - popped up all over Canadian rock radio stations. This song is the bands highest charting rock radio single in Canada to date.
2012.
N/A OK is nominated in the 'Rock' format at the 2012 Canadian Radio Music Awards.
In February, USS' second single from "USS APPROVED", 'Yo Hello Hooray (Everyday), appears on Degrassi, Season 11, Episode 32.
The band's third single from "USS APPROVED" - Damini - hits Canadian rock radio charts.
In April, the NHL Network on NHL.com featured Damini for their XM Plays of the Week.
At the end of May, USS travelled to Singapore to play five shows as a part of Music Matters 2012.
During the summer, Damini hits number one three times in the Modern Rock Countdown on Sonic 102.9 FM in Edmonton, Alberta Canada.
In August, USS traveled to Europe to support fellow Canadian band Walk off the Earth on their sold out tour there.This tour took the band to Germany,Austria,The Netherlands,France and the United Kingdom.

Albums.
"Welding the C:/".
The band's EP, "", was released July 30, 2008 and became a hot seller across Canada. After the video for "Hollowpoint Sniper Hyperbole" started airing regularly on MuchMusic, the band was offered a music video production grant from VideoFACT to do a partially animated video for the follow-up single, "2 15/16" - which also found its way onto the MuchMusic charts.
On May 30, 2008 the band headlined 102.1 The Edge's Next Big Thing Concert Series, to a record-setting capacity crowd of over 2600 people. The pair performed at the 2008 World Electronic Music Festival and were also the opening act on the main stage of the annual new-music festival, Edgefest, held by 102.1 The Edge. August 2008 saw the duo opening at the Cutting Edge Music Festival in Grand Bend Ontario.
On Sep 16, 2008 the duo performed live on MTV Canada. By October 22, 2008, USS won both of the CASBY Awards for which they were nominated: Best New Artist, and Best New Single, for the song "Hollowpoint Sniper Hyperbole". In winning the 'as voted by fans' awards, USS bested the likes of Bedouin Soundclash, Sam Roberts, Die Mannequin and Tokyo Police Club.
The duo also signed a worldwide publishing deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing later that October.
"Hollowpoint" was featured on the 13th edition of EMI's Big Shiny Tunes ('Sniper Hyperbole' was commonly publicly dropped, due to pronunciation issues).
"Welding the C:/" track list:
"Questamation".
USS released their first full length album "Questamation", through their independent label, Smashing World Records, on Mar 9, 2009. For the recording, USS teamed up again with Matthew Von Wagner (Crystal Castles, Alpha Galates) for production and engineering, while Chris Davies and Charles Topping 'aided musically'. Music engineer Bob Ludwig was recruited to master the original album in Portland, Maine. James Black of Finger Eleven is featured playing guitar on "P.S. I Can Change".
The CD packaging was based on the patented Z-CARD design, folding out much like a map. USS was the first band in North America to adopt this design for their album packaging.
Parallel to the album release, USS created the video for "Laces Out", which followed onto MuchMusic in March 2009
USS won the award for Favourite Group/Duo at the CMW Indie Awards on March 14, 2009 in Toronto.

Almere Buiten railway station

Almere Buiten is a railway station which lies in Almere, in the Netherlands. It is located approximately 27 km east of Amsterdam. The station is located on the Weesp–Lelystad railway, which runs between Weesp and Lelystad Centrum.

<doc id="19408353" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19408353" title="The Bells of Rhymney">
The Bells of Rhymney

"The Bells of Rhymney" is a song first recorded by folk singer Pete Seeger, using words written by Welsh poet Idris Davies. The lyrics to the song were drawn from part of Davies' poetic work "Gwalia Deserta", which was first published in 1938. The work was inspired by a local coal mining disaster and by the failure of the 1926 General Strike and the "Bells of Rhymney" stanzas follow the pattern of the nursery rhyme "Oranges and Lemons". In addition to Rhymney, the poem also refers to the bells of a number of other places in South Wales, including Merthyr, Rhondda, Blaina, Caerphilly, Neath, Brecon, Swansea, Newport, Cardiff, and the Wye Valley. 
Two decades after "Gwalia Deserta" was published, Seeger used one part of the work as lyrics for his song "The Bells of Rhymney" after discovering them in a book by Dylan Thomas. The song was first released as part of a suite of songs, including "Sinking of the Ruben James" and "There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly", on Seeger and Sonny Terry's 1958 live album, "Pete Seeger and Sonny Terry". The song was also included on Seeger's 1967 compilation album, "Pete Seeger's Greatest Hits". 
Arguably the most famous rendition of the song is the version recorded by the American folk rock band The Byrds. The Byrds' recording of "The Bells of Rhymney" was committed to tape on April 14, 1965, and released as part of the band's debut album, "Mr. Tambourine Man". At the time of recording, the song was a relative newcomer to The Byrds' repertoire, having first been performed during the band's March 1965, pre-fame residency at Ciro's nightclub on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. Lead guitarist Jim McGuinn had brought the song to the band after becoming familiar with it as an arranger on Judy Collins' third album, "Judy Collins 3", which itself included a cover version of "The Bells of Rhymney". Although The Byrds were anxious to correctly pronounce the Welsh place-names in the song's lyrics on their recording, they actually mispronounced the name Rhymney as "Rimney" (it should be pronounced as "Rumney").
The Byrds' version of "The Bells of Rhymney" features a number of the band's early musical trademarks, including their complex harmony singing and McGuinn's jangly twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar playing. In his book "Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever", author Scott Schinder has noted that the band's rendition of the song "managed to craft the dour subject matter into a radio-friendly pop song without sacrificing the song's haunting message." The Byrds' recording of "The Bells of Rhymney" was also influential on The Beatles, particularly George Harrison, who constructed his song "If I Needed Someone" around the same guitar riff that The Byrds had used in the song.
"The Bells of Rhymney" was also covered by Cher, soon after the release of The Byrds' version, on her "All I Really Want to Do" album. The song has been recorded by many other artists over the years, including The Serendipity Singers, The Alarm, The Ian Campbell Folk Group, John Denver, Jimmy Page, Robyn Hitchcock, Oysterband and Ralph McTell. As a result, the song has been important in making the town of Rhymney known to many outside Wales.

Arbor Day (film)

Arbor Day is a 1936 "Our Gang" short comedy film directed by Fred C. Newmeyer. It was the 145th "Our Gang" short that was released.
Plot.
Spanky attempts to hide from the truant officer and avoid going to school, where he is being forced to participate in the Spring Street School's annual Arbor Day show. Alfalfa tries to talk him out of his fears, but truant officer Smithers happens along to personally usher both children to school himself.
Meanwhile, a husband and wife midget pair (George and Olive Brasno) walk out on their circus sideshow jobs. They disguise themselves as children to enjoy a day about town, but Smithers mistakes them for actual children and takes them to school. At school, the kids trudge through their Arbor Day recitals and songs (Alfalfa contributes a squeaky rendition of Joyce Kilmer's "Trees" set to song (by Oscar Rasbach)). When the midgets-in-disguise offer to join in the show, they contribute a shimmy routine which shocks the entire audience of faculty and parents. The circus proprietor turns up to apprehend the two midgets, who, as they are carried away back to the circus, call out to the recital audience "Come by and see a "good" show sometime!" Principal Cass then informs Smithers he's fired, to Spanky and Alfala's delight.

Münchenstein rail disaster

The Münchenstein rail disaster on 14 June 1891 was historically the worst railway accident ever to affect Switzerland. A crowded passenger train fell through a girder bridge, killing over seventy people and injuring many more. The accident occurred on the railway line between Basel and Delémont, near the Bruckgut just below the village centre of Münchenstein, as the train was traversing the bridge across the river Birs. 
Bridge.
The single-track bridge had been built in 1874–75 by Gustave Eiffel (1832–1923), who went on to build the Eiffel Tower in 1889. The contract was given to Eiffel & Cie by the Jurabahn (later Jura–Simplon Railway), a private railway company. Eiffel's engineering company had already acquired the necessary experience, having previously planned and built numerous railway bridges and viaducts in France such as those at Rouzat and Bouble in the Massif Central.
The bridge was composed of wrought iron lattice girders, with an overall length of 42 metres. It crossed the river some five metres above water level at an angle of 51°, and it was completed and put into use in 1875. There were no reasons for complaint, even after serious local floods on the river Birs in 1881, but it was repaired and modified thereafter. One of the abutments was destroyed, leaving the bridge resting on just three points rather than the intended four piers. As one corner sank under its own weight, serious cracks were produced. The affected parts were replaced, and further strengthening was done in 1890 after the introduction of heavier locomotives.
Disaster.
On June 14,1891 at 14:15 a train left the main Basel railway station for Delémont. Owing to the large number of passengers, two supplementary passenger carriages and an additional engine had been added to the train at the last moment. In the findings of the examination report it was estimated that the number of travellers aboard was between 530 and 550.
The disaster occurred as the passenger train, which had been travelling at full speed, applied its brakes before and while crossing over the bridge, immediately before entering the Münchenstein railway station. Eye witnesses said that the bridge appeared to break in the centre as the front wheels of the locomotive reached the further abutment. The train did not derail at any time during the collapse. 
The front part of the train, including the two engines, the two additional passenger carriages, a postal carriage, an express carriage and two further passenger carriages, fell into the river. The first two passenger carriages sank into the river as the following carriages pushed them forwards. A further passenger carriage hung diagonally from the abutment facing downwards towards the river. The final five passenger carriages remained upon the tracks, virtually undamaged.
As the first carriages fell into the river, the air brake system pipes were severed and the brakes in the rear carriages were therefore instantly applied, keeping them standing on the tracks. Most of the passengers in the rear part of the train were uninjured.
The disaster claimed the lives of 73 and seriously injured 171 people.
Inquiry.
The subsequent inquiry focused on the state of the bridge, the quality of the ironwork and the design. A new institute "Empa" ("Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology") started work in 1880. In its first years of activity, "Empa" was involved in wide-ranging quality testing of building and structural materials for the "Swiss National Exhibition" of 1883. Intensive research work by the co-founder and first director, Prof. Ludwig von Tetmajer, gave rise to the first publications on the testing and standardisation of building materials and metals. Tetmajer was also commissioned to investigate the cause of the collapse of the Münchenstein railway bridge, which was responsible for what was at that time the worst railway disaster to have occurred in Europe. His investigation of the collapse revealed that Euler's formula for buckling, which had hitherto been used to calculate design loads in such structures, needed to be corrected for "slender bars".

Scanning confocal electron microscopy

Scanning confocal electron microscopy (SCEM) is an electron microscopy technique analogous to scanning confocal optical microscopy (SCOM). In this technique, the studied sample is illuminated by a focussed electron beam, as in other scanning microscopy techniques, such as scanning transmission electron microscopy or scanning electron microscopy. However, in SCEM, the collection optics is arranged symmetrically to the illumination optics to gather only the electrons that pass the beam focus. This results in superior depth resolution of the imaging. The technique is relatively new and is being actively developed.
History.
The idea of SCEM logically follows from SCOM and thus is rather old. However, practical design and construction of scanning confocal electron microscope is a complex problem first solved by Nestor J. Zaluzec. His first scanning confocal electron microscope demonstrated the 3D properties of the SCEM, but have not realized the sub-nanometer lateral spatial resolution achievable with high-energy electrons (lateral resolution of only ~80 nm has been demonstrated). Several groups are currently working on construction of atomic resolution SCEM. In particular, atomically resolved SCEM images have already been obtained 
Operation.
The sample is illuminated by a focussed electron beam, and the beam is re-focussed on the detector, thus collecting only electrons passing through the focus. In order to produce an image, the beam should be laterally scanned. In the original design, this was achieved by placing synchronized scanning and descanning deflectors. Such design is complex and only a few custom-built setups exist. Another approach is to use stationary illumination and collection, but perform scan by moving the sample with a high-precision piezo-controlled holder. Such holders are readily available and can fit into most commercial electron microscopes thereby realizing the SCEM mode. As a practical demonstration, atomically resolved SCEM images have been recorded.
Advantages of SCEM.
High energies of incident particles (200 keV electrons vs. 2 eV photons) result in much higher spatial resolution of SCEM as compared to SCOM (lateral resolution <1 nm vs. >400 nm). 
As compared to conventional electron microscopy (TEM, STEM, SEM), SCEM offers 3-dimensional imaging. 3D imaging in SCEM was expected from the confocal geometry of SCEM, and it has recently been confirmed by theoretical modeling. In particular, it is predicted that a heavy layer (gold) can be identified in light matrix (aluminum) with ~10 nm precision in depth; this depth resolution is limited by the convergence angle of the electron beam and could be improved to a few nanometers in next-generation electron microscopes equipped with two fifth-order spherical aberration correctors.

George Ashley Campbell

George Ashley Campbell (November 27, 1870 – November 10, 1954) was a pioneer in developing and applying quantitative mathematical methods to the problems of long-distance telegraphy and telephony. His most important contributions were to the theory and implementation of the use of loading coils and the first wave filters designed to what was to become known as the image method. Both these areas of work resulted in important economic advantages for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T).
Education.
He graduated from MIT in 1891, and then received a master’s degree from Harvard University in 1893. He was awarded a fellowship which enabled him to spend three years on graduate work; one year studying advanced mathematics under Felix Klein at Göttingen, one year studying electricity and mechanics under Ludwig Boltzmann in Vienna, and one year studying under Henri Poincaré in Paris. Campbell received a doctorate from Harvard in 1901 with his dissertation being on the subject of his loading coil research at AT&T.
Work on loading coils.
In 1897 Campbell went to work for AT&T in Boston. He developed a method for transmitting analog telephony over much greater distances than had previously been possible by the insertion of loading coils into the line at carefully calculated intervals to increase the inductance. Engineer Michael I. Pupin also patented a similar system and AT&T paid Pupin a very large sum for his patents, so that development would continue without a legal battle. In fact, neither man was the first to suggest the idea of loading coils, that credit goes to Oliver Heaviside in an 1887 article. Heaviside, however, never patented the idea; indeed, he took no commercial advantage of any of his brilliant work. Despite the rather arcane legal arguments surrounding this, it is unquestionable that Campbell was the first to actually construct a telephone circuit using loading coils.
Campbell was aware of Heaviside's work in discovering the Heaviside condition, in which the specification for distortionless transmission of signals is formulated, but apparently was not aware of Heaviside's suggestion of using loading coils to force a line to meet it. Campbell initially attacked the problem from a completely different basis. Campbell was tasked by AT&T to investigate the possibility of improving line quality with the use of iron-copper bimetallic cable invented by John S. Stone, another AT&T engineer. This cable of Stone's would similarly increase line inductance and had the potential to meet the Heaviside condition. However, Campbell was struggling to set up a practical demonstration over a real telephone route with the budget he had been allocated. After considering that his artificial line simulators used lumped components rather than the distributed quantities found in a real line, he wondered if he could not insert the inductance with lumped components instead of using Stone's distributed line. When his calculations showed that the manholes on telephone routes were sufficiently close together to be able to insert the loading coils without the expense of either having to dig up the route or lay in new cables he changed to this new plan. The very first demonstration of loading coils on a telephone cable was on a 46-mile length of the so-called Pittsburgh cable (the test was actually in Boston, the cable had previously been used for testing in Pittsburgh) on September 6, 1899 carried out by Campbell himself and his assistant. The first telephone cable using loaded lines put into public service was between Jamaica Plains and West Newton in Boston on May 18, 1900.
Legal battle.
AT&T fought a legal battle with Pupin over his claim. Pupin was first to patent but Campbell had already conducted practical demonstrations before Pupin had even filed his patent (December 1899), Campbell's delay in filing being due to the slow internal machinations of AT&T. The claim Pupin makes in his autobiography that he had previously thought of the idea while climbing a mountain in 1894 is widely doubted and there is no evidence for this either documentary or in the subsequent activities of Pupin and his students. However, AT&T foolishly deleted from Campbell's proposed patent application all the tables and graphs detailing the exact value of inductance that would be required before the patent was submitted. Since Pupin's patent contained a (less accurate) formula, AT&T was open to claims of incomplete disclosure. Fearing that there was a risk that the battle would end with the invention being declared unpatentable, they decided to buy an option on Pupin's patent for a yearly fee so that AT&T would control both patents. By January 1901 Pupin had been paid $200,000 and by 1917, when the AT&T monopoly ended and payments ceased, he had received a total of $455,000.
The invention was of enormous value to AT&T. Telephone cables could now be used to twice the distance previously possible, or alternatively, a cable of half the previous quality (and cost) could be used over the same distance. When considering whether to allow Campbell to go ahead with the demonstration, their engineers had estimated that they stood to save $700,000 in new installation costs in New York and New Jersey alone. It has been estimated that AT&T saved $100 million in the first quarter of the 20th century. Heaviside, who began it all, came away with nothing. He was offered a token payment but would not accept, wanting the credit for his work rather than money. He remarked ironically that if his prior publication had been admitted it would "interfere . . . with the flow of dollars in the proper direction . . .".
Work on filters.
One of the important results of the work on loading coils was that the loading caused a cut-off at a definite frequency in the line response, whose value could be predicted with a knowledge of the line capacitance and coil inductance. An unloaded line had no such behavior, the attenuation simply steadily increased with frequency. This behavior, and the lumped element networks being used to create artificial lines for test purposes, suggested to Campbell a possible topology for a filter with similar characteristics.
This work on filtering was begun in 1910. Using a ladder network of inductors and capacitors in appropriate configurations he produced low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters. These filters could be designed to pass frequencies in any specified range and reject those in other ranges. This class of filter was later to be dubbed the constant k filter by Otto Zobel working for AT&T in New York.
The sharpness of transition from the passband to the stopband, and the depth of rejection in the stopband were determined by the number of sections in the ladder. If a tighter specification was required for the filter, all that was necessary was to add more inductors and capacitors to the ladder in exactly the same circuit configuration as those for a less stringent specification.
The purpose of filtering a telephone channel so precisely was that AT&T were attempting to use the same wires for many telephone conversations simultaneously using the technique of frequency division multiplexing (FDM) and it was important for reasons of privacy, as well as intelligibility, that there was no crosstalk between the channels. Filters were also required to separate out the various conversations at the far end of the cable. Initially, a passband of 200 Hz to 2.5 kHz was used for the voice baseband, but soon the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) established the world standard of 300 Hz to 3.4 kHz with 4 kHz spacing between channels.
These filter designs, which Zobel was later to improve upon, were of great economic value to AT&T. The ability to send multiple conversations over the same wires resulted in very substantial savings in cable installation costs. The modulation system used (single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission) and the ITU standard remained the primary method of telephone service distribution until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.

Plot.
During a slow day at school, Alfalfa spends penmanship class writing a note to Spanky, informing his pal that the three "little kids", Buckwheat and Porky, have firecrackers and that Spanky should think of a way to relieve them of their possessions. Alfalfa delivers his note to Spanky via paper airplane, and as soon as recess begins, the two boys stop Buckwheat and Porky at the door and offer to trade a magnifying glass and a water pistol for the firecrackers.
When Buckwheat and Porky refuse their offer, Spanky and Alfalfa sneak into the janitor's office and borrow his clothing to disguise themselves as an adult. Spanky sits on Alfalfa's shoulders, and also cuts Alfalfa's cowlick off to use as a mustache (Alfalfa, upon learning Spanky has shorn him of his trademark: "I'm ruined!").
Telling the little kids that he's a G-man, the ersatz Spanky-Alfalfa "adult" succeeds in extracting the firecrackers from Buckwheat. Spanky and Alfafa fail to make an escape, however, without giving away their disguise. Undaunted, Spanky discards the disguise and begins attempting to light the firecrackers with his magnifying glass. Buckwheat gets even with him by sneaking into the classroom and ringing the teacher's bell, bringing recess to an early end. As everyone heads inside, Spanky has Alfalfa stuff the firecrackers in his back pocket, and Porky picks up Spanky's magnifying glass, which he'd left discarded on the ground as he headed back inside.
Back in class, Miss Lawrence calls on the children to recite their recitations, but it turns out that Alfalfa is the only one willing to recite. He stands to recite "The Charge of the Light Brigade," revealing the firecrackers in his back pocket. Using the magnifying glass, Porky trains the light on Alfalfa's pocket, setting off the firecrackers so that by the time Alfalfa reaches the ""Cannons to the left of me/Cannons to the right of me/Volleyed and thundered"" verses of the poem, the poor boy's backside is on fire. Alfalfa runs around the classroom and then outside where he puts his rear out in a washtub full of cold water. With his mouth hanging open and his eyes closed, he dunks his rear end into the cold water over and over again. He does this as the rest of the class looks on and begins to laugh at the situation. At first he does not notice them, but then he looks over as he continues to dunk. When Alfalfa sees the whole class staring at him, he turns red and is VERY embarrassed, but can't stop dunking because it feels so good. Hilarious!

Pay as You Exit

Pay as You Exit is a 1936 "Our Gang" short comedy film directed by Gordon Douglas. It was the 148th "Our Gang" short that was released.
Plot.
Hoping to attract customers to Spanky's barnyard production of "Romeo and Juliet", star performer Alfalfa proposes a "pay as you exit" policy: If the kids like the show, they'll pay the allotted one-cent admission on the way out. Alas, the show is nearly over before it starts when leading lady Darla walks out, complaining that Alfalfa has been eating onions (which, he insists, improves his splendid speaking voice). After stalling for time, Spanky hits upon a replacement for Darla: black youngster Buckwheat (who actually was supposed to be a girl a year before but morphed into a boy by this time), decked out in a glorious blonde wig. However, the ladder on Alfalfa gives way; Buckwheat saves him before he falls. When the ladder gives way again, Alfalfa tells Buckwheat to hold on tight, but the aroma of onions gets to Buckwheat, causing him to let go; Alfalfa then falls into the audience. When the audience leaves, Spanky admonishes him for his "pay as you exit" scheme. But pay they did and Alfalfa and Spanky eat onions as a toast to their success.
