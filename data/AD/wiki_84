Funafuti

Funafuti is an atoll on which the capital of the island nation of Tuvalu is located. It has a population of 6,194 people (2012 Population & Housing Census Preliminary Analytical Report), making it the most populated atoll with 57.2 percent of Tuvalu. It is a narrow sweep of land between wide, encircling a large lagoon long and wide. With a surface of , it is by far the largest lagoon in Tuvalu. The land area of the 33 islets aggregates to , less than one percent of the total area of the atoll.
Fongafale.
The largest island is Fongafale. The island houses four villages and community meeting places. Tausoalima Falekaupule is the traditional meeting house on Funafuti – Tausoalima means "hand of friendship" and Falekaupule means "traditional island meeting hall." There is the Vaiaku Langi Hotel, and other guesthouses as well as homes, constructed both in the traditional manner, out of palm fronds, and more recently out of cement blocks. The most prominent building on Funafuti atoll is the "Fetu Ao Lima" of the Church of Tuvalu. Other sites of interest are the remains of Japanese aircraft that crashed on Funafuti during World War II. The airfield was constructed during World War II and is now the Funafuti International Airport, which serves both as the airstrip for the flights from Fiji as well as providing a place for sporting and other recreational activities.
A major sporting event is the "Independence Day Sports Festival" held annually at Fongafale on 1 October. The most important sports event within the country is arguably the Tuvalu Games, which are held yearly since 2008 with teams coming to Funafuti from the outer islands to compete in the games. Football in Tuvalu is played at club and national team level. The Tuvalu national football team trains at the Tuvalu Sports Ground on Funafuti and competes in the Pacific Games and South Pacific Games.
The Parliament of Tuvalu or "Palamene o Tuvalu" is located on Fongafale together with the offices of the government departments and the government agencies including the Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau. The capital of Tuvalu is sometimes given as Fongafale or Vaiaku, but the entire atoll of Funafuti is officially the capital. The Princess Margaret Hospital is the only hospital in Tuvalu. As Funafuti is an atoll, cargo ships can enter the lagoon and dock at the port facilities on Fongafale.

Funafuti Marine Conservation Area.
In June 1996, the Funafuti Conservation Area was established along the western rim of the reef, encompassing six islets. It has an area of 33 km², containing 20 percent of the reef area of Funafuti. The land area of the six islets in the conservation area is 8 ha (0.08 km²). The islets in the conservation area, from north to south, with estimated area in hectares:
Access to the Funafuti Conservation Area is by boat; the Conservation Area is across the lagoon from the main island of Fongafale.
Islands in Funafuti.
There are at least 29 islets in the atoll. The biggest is Fongafale, followed by Funafala. At least three islands are inhabited, which are Fongafale, the main island in the east, Funafala in the south, and Amatuku in the north.
Passages of Funafuti Atoll.
The atoll has several passages with varying degrees of navigability that lead into the lagoon. The passes are listed clockwise, starting south of Fongafale islet. The first two clearly separate the southern part of Funafuti Atoll from the rest.
Lagoon.
The lagoon ("TeNamo" in Tuvaluan) of Funafuti atoll has a north-south length of 24.5 km, and east-west 17.5 km, with an area of 275 km², making it by far the largest lagoon of Tuvalu. It is up to 52 metres deep, but has several submerged rocks and reefs that are coming as close as 6 metres to the surface.
History.
[[File: H-C-Fassett-Ellice-Is-1900.jpg|200px|right|thumb|alt=1900, Woman on Funafuti, Tuvalu, then known as Ellice Islands| Woman on Funafuti,
Harry Clifford Fassett (1900)]]
The founding ancestor of the people of Funafuti is described as being from Samoa. The name of one of the islets Funafala means 'the pandanus of Funa', the name of a chief, after whom also the atoll has been named Funafuti.
The first European to visit Funafuti was Arent Schuyler de Peyster, of New York, captain of the armed brigantine or privateer "Rebecca", sailing under British colours. Arent Schuyler de Peyster passed through the southern Tuvalu waters in May 1819 sighting Funafuti, which he named Ellice's Island after an English Politician, Edward Ellice, the Member of Parliament for Coventry and the owner of the Rebecca's cargo.
The United States Exploring Expedition under Charles Wilkes visited Funafuti in 1841. The US claimed Funafuti under the Guano Islands Act from the 19th century until a treaty of friendship was concluded in 1979, coming into effect in 1983.
John (also known as Jack) O'Brien was the first European to settle in Tuvalu, he became a trader on Funafuti in the 1850s. He married Salai, the daughter of the paramount chief of Funafuti. Alfred Restieaux was a trader on Funafuti from July 1881. In 1892 Captain Davis of , reported on trading activities and traders on each of the islands visited. Captain Davis identified Jack O'Brien as being a trader on Funafuti.
In 1894, Count Rudolph Festetics de Tolna, his wife Eila (née Haggin) and her daughter Blanche Haggin visited Funafuti aboard the yacht "Le Tolna". The Count spent several days photographing men and woman of Funafuti.
The boreholes on Funafuti at the site now called "Darwin's Drill", are the result of drilling conducted by the Royal Society of London for the purpose of investigating whether traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the coral, as a test of Darwin's theory of coral atoll formation. Drilling occurred in 1896, 1897 and 1898. Professor Edgeworth David of the University of Sydney was a member of the 1896 expedition and was the leader of the 1897 expedition. Photographers on the expeditions recorded people, communities and scenes at Funafuti.
Harry Clifford Fassett, captain's clerk and photographer, recorded people, communities and scenes at Funafuti during a visit of "USFC Albatross" when the US Fish Commission was investigating the formation of coral reefs on Pacific atolls.
The population of Funafuti from 1860 to 1900 is estimated to be between 280 and 300 people.
Funafuti Post Office opened around 1911.
Cyclones of 1883 & 1972.
George Westbrook, a trader on Funafuti, recorded a tropical cyclone that struck Funafuti in 1883. At the time of the cyclone struck he was the sole inhabitant of Fongafale as Tema, the Samoan missionary, had taken everyone else to Funafala to work on erecting a church. The buildings on Fongafale were destroyed, including the church and the trade stores of George Westbrook and Alfred Restieaux. Little damage had occurred at Funafala and the people returned to rebuild at Fongafale.
In 1972 Funafuti was in the path of Cyclone Bebe. Tropical Cyclone Bebe was a pre-season tropical cyclone that impacted the Gilbert, Ellice Islands, and Fiji island groups. First spotted on 20 October, the system intensified and grew in size through 22 October. At about 4 p.m. on Saturday 21st sea water was bubbling through the coral on the airfield with the water reaching a height of about high. Cyclone Bebe continued through Sunday 22 October. The Ellice Islands Colony's ship "Moanaraoi" was in the lagoon and survived, however 3 tuna boats were wrecked. Waves broke over the atoll. Five people died, two adults and a 3-month-old child were swept away by waves, and two sailors from the tuna boats were drowned. Cyclone Bebe knocked down 90% of the houses and trees. The storm surge created a wall of coral rubble along the ocean side of Fongafale and Funafala that was about long, and about to thick at the bottom. The cyclone contaminated sources of drinking water as a result of the system's storm surge and fresh water flooding.
Educational institutions.
There are two junior schools, the Seventh Day Adventist Primary School and Nauti Primary School, which as a role of more than 900 and is the largest primary school in Tuvalu (45 percent of the total primary school enrolment). The Church of Tuvalu operates Fetuvalu High School. The University of the South Pacific (USP) Extension Centre on Funafuti operates the Augmented Foundation Programme for sixth form students who pass their Pacific Secondary School Certificate (PSSC) so that the students can enter tertiary education programmes outside of Tuvalu. The Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI) is located on Amatuki motu (islet).
Transportation.
Funafuti International Airport is located on Fongafale. Flights are only available twice a week to Suva, Fiji, on Pacific Sun, the regional carrier of Fiji Airways, Fiji's national airline. Pacific Sun flies ATR 42-500 42-seat turboprops between Suva and Funafuti. The airport code for Funafuti is FUN.
There are port facilities on Fongafale. There are two passenger/cargo ships, "Nivaga II" and "Manu Folau", which provide round trip visits to the outer islands every three or four weeks and which also travel between Suva, Fiji and Funafuti 3 to 4 times a year.
Constituency.
Funafuti is one of the eight constituencies in Tuvalu, and elects two Members of Parliament. Following the 2010 general election, its current representatives are Kausea Natano and Kamuta Latasi. Both were successfully re-elected incumbents.

Vera Lynn

Dame Vera Lynn, DBE (born Vera Margaret Welch on 20 March 1917), widely known as "The Forces' Sweetheart" is an English singer, songwriter and actress whose musical recordings and performances were enormously popular during the Second World War.
During the war she toured Egypt, India and Burma, giving outdoor concerts for the troops. The songs most associated with her are "We'll Meet Again", "The White Cliffs of Dover", "A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square" and "There'll Always Be an England".
She remained popular after the war, appearing on radio and television in the UK and the United States and recording such hits as "Auf Wiederseh'n Sweetheart" and her UK Number one single "My Son, My Son".
In 2009 she became the oldest living artist to make it to No. 1 on the British album chart, at the age of 92. She has devoted much time and energy to charity work connected with ex-servicemen, disabled children and breast cancer. She is still held in great affection by veterans of the Second World War and in 2000 was named the Briton who best exemplified the spirit of the twentieth century.
Early life.
Vera Lynn was born Vera Margaret Welch on 20 March 1917 in East Ham, in what was then the county of Essex, now East London. When she began performing publicly at the age of seven, she adopted her grandmother's maiden name (Lynn) as her stage name. Her first radio broadcast, with the Joe Loss Orchestra, was in 1935. At this point she was being featured on records released by dance bands including those of Loss and of Charlie Kunz. In 1936 her first solo record was released on the Crown label, "Up the Wooden Hill to Bedfordshire". This label was absorbed by Decca Records in 1938. After a short stint with Loss she stayed with Kunz for a few years during which she recorded several standard musical pieces. In 1937, she moved to the aristocrat of British dance bands, Bert Ambrose.
In 1939, during the Phoney War, the Daily Express asked British servicemen to name their favourite musical performers: Vera Lynn came out on top and as a result became known as 'the Forces' Sweetheart'.
In 1941, during the darkest days of the Second World War, Lynn began her own radio programme, "Sincerely Yours", sending messages to British troops serving abroad. She and her quartet performed songs most requested by the soldiers. Lynn also visited hospitals to interview new mothers and send personal messages to their husbands overseas.
She is best known for her 1942 recording of the popular song "We'll Meet Again", written by Ross Parker and Hughie Charles; the nostalgic lyrics ("We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when, but I know we'll meet again some sunny day") were very popular during the war and made the song one of its emblematic hits. She also appeared in the 1943 film of that name. Her other great wartime hit was "The White Cliffs of Dover", words by Nat Burton, music by Walter Kent. Contrary to later reports, she neither sang nor recorded "Rose of England" during this time and it was only in 1966 when her producer, David Gooch, selected it for her album "More Hits of the Blitz" that she became familiar with it. The album itself was a follow-up to "Hits of the Blitz" produced by Norman Newell.
During the war years she joined ENSA and toured Egypt, India and Burma, giving outdoor concerts for the troops.In March 1944 she went to Shamsheernugger airfield to entertain the troops before the Battle of Kohima. Her host and lifelong friend Captain Bernard Holden recalled 'her courage and her contribution to morale'. In 1985 it was announced that she would receive the Burma Star for entertaining British guerrilla units in Japanese-occupied Burma. She is one of the last surviving major entertainers of the war years.
Post-war career.
Lynn's Auf Wiederseh'n Sweetheart became the first record by a British performer to top the charts in the United States, remaining there for nine weeks. She also appeared regularly for a time on Tallulah Bankhead's U.S. radio programme, "The Big Show". "Auf Wiederseh'n Sweetheart", along with "The Homing Waltz" and "Forget-Me-Not", gave Lynn a remarkable three entries on the first UK Singles Chart, a top 12 (which actually contained 15 songs owing to tied positions).
Her popularity continued in the 1950s, peaking with "My Son, My Son", a number-one hit in 1954 which she co-wrote with Gordon Melville Rees. In 1960 she left Decca Records after nearly 25 years, and joined EMI. She recorded for EMI's Columbia, MGM and HMV labels. In 1967, she recorded "It Hurts To Say Goodbye", a song which hit the top 10 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart."
Vera Lynn was the subject of This Is Your Life on two occasions, in October 1957 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre, and in December 1978, for an episode which was broadcast on 1 January 1979, when Andrews surprised her at the Cafe Royal, London.
She hosted her own variety series on BBC1 in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was a frequent guest on other variety shows, notably The 1972 "Morecambe & Wise" Christmas Show. In 1972 she was a key performer in the BBC anniversary programme Fifty Years Of Music. In 1976 she hosted the BBC's A Jubilee Of Music, celebrating the pop music hits of the period 1952-1976 to commemorate the start of Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee year. For ITV she presented a 1977 TV special to launch her album "Vera Lynn in Nashville", which included pop songs of the 1960s and country songs.
The Royal Variety Performance included appearances by Vera Lynn on four occasions: 1960, 1975, 1986 and 1990. Lynn was also interviewed about her role in entertaining the troops in the India Burma Theatre, for The World at War series in 1974.
Lynn is also notable for being the only artist to have a chart span on the British single and album charts reaching from the chart's inception to the 21st century — in 1952 having three singles in the first ever singles chart, complied by New Musical Express, and most recently having a #1 album with "We'll Meet Again — The Very Best Of Vera Lynn" (see below).
Honours.
Lynn was appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1969 New Year Honours "for services to the Royal Air Forces Association and other charities", and promoted to Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours "for charitable services". She was made an Officer of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem (OStJ) in 1998 and, in 2000, Dame Vera received a special "Spirit of the 20th Century" Award.
Charity work.
In 1953 Lynn formed the cerebral palsy charity SOS (The Stars Organisation for Spastics) and became its chairperson.
The Vera Lynn Charity Breast Cancer Research Trust was founded in 1976, with Lynn its chairperson and later its president.
In 2002 Lynn became president of the cerebral palsy charity The Dame Vera Lynn Trust for Children with Cerebral Palsy, and hosted a celebrity concert on its behalf at Queen Elizabeth Hall in London.
On 19 August 2008 Lynn became the Patron of the Forces Literary Organisation Worldwide for ALL, a charitable not-for-profit organisation which helps those affected by war.
On 16 November 2010 Dame Vera Lynn became Patron of The Dover War Memorial Project, a voluntary not-for-profit group remembering the Fallen from Dover, Kent, England.
On the 26th of November 2010 she became Patron of the UK registered charity Projects to Support Refugees from Burma / Help 4 Forgotten Allies. Help 4 Forgotten Allies provides annual grants to ex-servicemen, recruited by the British from the Karen and Karenni ethnic minorities. Living in Burma, they fought fiercely against the Japanese alongside the British, but were later persecuted for their British affiliations and struggle for independence. Many had to flee Burma and have lived in camps in great poverty on the Thai-Burma border for decades, deprived of freedom and basic necessities in their old age. Dame Vera feels the British have a moral duty to support those who fought alongside the British soldiers against the Japanese. 'Anybody who helped us during that war, if they served with us, they should be entitled to a pension.'
In 2013, she joined a PETA campaign against pigeon racing, stating that the sport was "utterly cruel."
Later years.
Lynn sang outside Buckingham Palace in 1995 in a ceremony that marked the golden jubilee of VE Day. This was her last known public performance.
The United Kingdom's VE Day Diamond Jubilee ceremonies in 2005 included a concert in Trafalgar Square, London, in which Lynn made an unannounced appearance. She made a speech praising the veterans and calling upon the younger generation always to remember their sacrifice and joined in with a few bars of "We'll Meet Again". Following that year's Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance, Dame Vera encouraged the Welsh mezzo-soprano singer Katherine Jenkins to assume the mantle of "Forces' Sweetheart".
In her speech Lynn said, "These boys gave their lives and some came home badly injured, and for some families life would never be the same. We should always remember, we should never forget, and we should teach the children to remember."
In September 2008 Lynn helped launch a new social history recording website, "The Times of My Life", at the Cabinet War Rooms in London.
On 3 September 2009 Andrew Castle hosted Lynn on GMTV to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Britain's declaring war on Germany. At the end of the interview she sang a verse from "We'll Meet Again," at Castle's request.
Her autobiography "Some Sunny Day" was published in August 2009, when Lynn was 92. She had written two previous memoirs: "Vocal Refrain" (1975) and "We'll Meet Again" (1989).
On 18 February 2009, "The Daily Telegraph" reported that Lynn was suing the British National Party (BNP) for using "the White Cliffs of Dover" on an anti-immigration album without her permission. Her lawyer claimed the album seemed to link Lynn, who does not align with any political party, to the party's views by association.
On 13 September 2009 Lynn became the oldest living artist to make it into No. 1 in the British album chart, at the age of 92, passing such veterans of music as American jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong and French singer Charles Aznavour. Her collection "" entered the chart at number 20 on 30 August, and then climbed to number 2 the following week, before reaching the top position, outselling both the Arctic Monkeys and the Beatles. In its third week the album went gold with sales of over 100,000.
Personal life.
In 1941 Lynn married Harry Lewis, a clarinetist and saxophonist, whom she had met two years earlier. They had one child, Virginia Penelope Anne Lewis. Harry Lewis died in 1999.
Lynn has lived in Ditchling in Sussex since the early 1960s.

In late September 1939 Vera Lynn first recorded a song that continues to be associated with her: We'll Meet Again was originally recorded with Arthur Young on the Novachord. 
Throughout the 1940s and 1950s the Decca label issued all of Vera Lynn's records, including several recorded with Mantovani and His Orchestra in 1942 and with Robert Farnon, from the late 1940s. Firstly they were only available as 78rpm singles, which only feature two songs an A and a B-side.

Wendy Renee Brown (born January 28, 1966) is a retired heptathlete and triple jumper from the United States. She competed in the heptathlon at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, finishing in 18th place behind teammate Jackie Joyner Kersee's still current world record. As the event was in transition to become an official event, she set the world record in the women's triple jump twice in the mid-1980s. Because this was before the event was declared official, neither of those records were officially ratified. Brown went to the University of Southern California where she won the 1986 NCAA Indoor Championship in the Triple Jump and later winning 1988 NCAA Championship in the Heptathlon. She is still the school record holder in the Triple Jump and Heptathlon, as well as being ranked second in Long Jump and High Jump. She's even ranked 5th in the Javelin throw.
In 1984, while competing for Woodside High School, Brown won the CIF California State Track team title for her high school singlehandedly. She scored 38 points winning the Long Jump, Triple Jump and High Jump, and was second in the 100 Hurdles behind future "fastest Woman in the world" Gail Devers. Her 42'10 1/2" jump that year was the NFHS national high school record in the triple jump for seven years. Later in 1984 she won the Pan American Junior Championships in the Long Jump and finishing 4th in the 100 metres hurdles
In 1990, Brown had success as a contestant in the television series American Gladiators, appearing in four episodes and going to the final round of the "second half."

Coast Guardsman - Boatswain Mate Second Class (BM2) Richard R. Callahan of Cicero, Illinois was awarded the Coast Guard Medal for heroic life saving actions along with two comrades. 
Boatswain Mate First Class (BM1) Edgar Culbertson, 32, of Ferndale, Michigan lost his life on April 30, 1967 while trying to rescue three teenagers in Duluth, Minnesota. Three teenage boys had been seen on the north pier break wall of the Duluth entry during a horrific storm. Meteorologist and Minnesota residents often refer to this day as Black Sunday describing the fierce 1967 Southern Minnesota tornado outbreak, with reports of heavy rain as far north as Duluth that day.
BM1 Edgar Culbertson, along with two other Coast Guardsmen; Boatswain Mate 2nd Class Richard R. Callahan, 21, of Cicero, Illinois; and Fireman Ronald C. Prei, 21, of St. Francis, Wisconsin braved the storm and ventured out along the pier in search of the missing teenagers. A witness had reported seeing the teenagers caught in the storm on the pier while one of the boys was swept over the side by a huge wave.Local resident and friend of "Ed", Captain Tom Mackay, recalled the evening of this infamous storm as being so windy and rough it blew the chimney down on the Mackay house which was a few miles from the north pier break wall of the Duluth entry and farther down Park Point. 
The three Coast Guardsmen connected themselves to each other by tying between them. They struggled through the storm to the end of the pier but did not find the missing boys, who had already been swept over the side themselves before the Coast Guardsmen could save them. As the team of rescuers shuffled back along the pier to safety another large wave crashed into the team, knocking BM1 Edgar Culbertson over the side and away from the others. He was soon found on the beach by his shipmates but it was too late, he had been killed trying to save lives. 
A permanent marker, honoring the brave acts of Edgar Culbertson, was placed on the pier near the Lake Superior Maritime Visitor Center near the spot where Culbertson perished. Culbertson is one of only two Coasties to have died in the line of duty while serving in Minnesota, the other was EN3 Keith Brubaker who fell overboard and perished on July 11, 1967 while serving the Station North Superior in Grand Marais, Minnesota. 
The original bronze plaque was erected some time after Culbertson gave his life to the vicious storm. However in the early 1980s the plaque was removed as the pier was widened and reinforced. Captain Tom Mackay, then a Captain for the Vista Fleet and president of the International Shipmasters Association (ISMA) Twin Ports Lodge #12 realized the plaque had not been reinstalled. Fearing that his friend, and fellow sailor would be forgotten forever, Mackay rallied those at the ISMA to help him locate the plaque and have it reinstalled. A short time later, fellow members of the ISMA found the plaque in storage and had it reinstalled on the new pier so BM1 Edgar Culbertson could continue to be memorialized as the only known member of the United States Coast Guard to lose his life in Duluth in service to his country and community of Duluth, Minnesota.
BM1 Edgar Culbertson was posthumously awarded the Coast Guard Medal as well as BM2 Richard R. Callahan, FN Ronald C. Prei were awarded the Coast Guard Medal.
Coast Guard Medal Citation.
Date of Action: 30 April 1967
Date of Award: 17 August 1967
For heroism on the evening of April 30, 1967 while engaged in searching for two teen-age boys reportedly stranded at the Duluth Entry North Breakwater Light, Minnesota. Twin 16-year old boys and a brother had been seen running along the jetty challenging the 10 to 15-foot waves when witnesses observed a huge wave sweep one boy into the water. When two boys were reported stranded at the light, Petty Officer CALLAHAN and two comrades volunteered to attempt the rescue. Lashing themselves together, the three men proceeded, with hand lanterns as the only illumination, to the end of the breakwater. Despite the high waves, winds gusting to 40 knots, driving rain, and 36 degree water, the rescue party diligently searched the breakwater and light but found no trace of the boys. While returning to the beach a 20-foot wave swept the lead man off the jetty nearly causing the loss of all three men. Petty Officer CALLAHAN in attempting to retrieve his fellow Coastguardsman suffered a broken wrist and severe body bruises. In spite of excruciating pain, through sheer determination, Petty Officer CALLAHAN and his companion managed to pull their teammate onto the beach, where all efforts to revive him failed. Petty Officer CALLAHAN's courage, unselfish actions, perseverance and unwavering devotion to duty reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Coast Guard.

Fairchild F-46

The Fairchild F-46, also known as the Duramold Aircraft Corporation F-46 A, is a light aircraft that was built using the Duramold process, later used on the Spruce Goose.
Development.
The F-46 was the first aircraft to use the Duramold process developed by Virginius E. Clark employing heat, pressure, plastics and wood to make complex structures in less time than could be done with aluminum construction. Fairchild created its own Duramold branch to use the technology for making structures.
Design.
The Model 46 is a low-wing, cabin aircraft, with conventional landing gear and structures made using Duramold processes. The fuselage is constructed of two halves bonded together. The wings use wooden spars with plywood covering. The control surfaces use aluminum frames with aircraft fabric covering. A fuel tank was mounted in each wing.
Operational history.
In 1947 the Model 46 prototype was re-engined with a Pratt & Whitney R-985 and flown for ten years.

Knol

Knol was a Google project that aimed to include user-written articles on a range of topics. The project was led by Udi Manber of Google, announced December 13, 2007, and was opened in beta to the public on July 23, 2008 with a few hundred articles mostly in the health and medical field. Some Knol pages were opinion papers of one or more authors, and others described products for sale. Some articles were how-to articles or explained product use. Other people could post comments below an article, such as to refute opinions or reject product claims.
Lower-case, the term "knol", which Google defined as a "unit of knowledge", referred to an article in the project. Several experts saw Knol as Google's attempt to compete with Wikipedia, while others pointed out the differences between the projects.
On January 16, 2009, Google announced that Knol had grown to 100,000 articles, and users from 197 countries visited Knol on an average day. On November 22, 2011, Google announced that Knol was to be phased out in favor of Annotum. It was closed on April 30, 2012, and all content was deleted by October 1, 2012.
Content.
Knol pages were "meant to be the first thing someone who searches for this topic for the first time will want to read", according to Udi Manber.
Any contributors can create (and own) new Knol articles, and there can be multiple articles on the same topic, each written by a different author. At least one reviewer has decried the hundreds of repetitive entries that result from this system. Because multiple articles could have the same title, readers found a topic by searching, rather than just by title. The authors had an option to allow their articles to be edited by the public, to make them editable only to co-authors or to make them closed entirely.
Knol had a content policy describing topics unacceptable for the project. Relevant nudity was allowed (in most countries), but pornography, commercial or otherwise, was forbidden. Also forbidden is discriminatory or violent content. In 2008 Google began promoting Knols as a forum for debate.
Content designed to promote businesses, products or services was allowed, but articles devoid of substantive content and created solely to generate ad revenue were not. Authors could also choose to include ads from Google's AdSense to their pages. This profit-sharing was criticized as incentivizing self-promotion or spam.
Process.
All contributors to the Knol project had to sign in first with a Google account and are supposed to state their real names. If permission is given, Google would check the veracity of the name information by credit card or phone (currently only for users residing in the US). Google " that knowing who wrote what will significantly help users make better use of web content", and it hopes that "knols will include the opinions and points of view of the authors who will put their reputation on the line".
Readers with Google accounts were able to rate, comment on, or suggest edits to the articles, in the style of comments after a blog entry. When the project was announced, Manber said that "Google will not serve as an editor in any way, and will not bless any content. All editorial responsibilities and control will rest with the authors."
All contributions were licensed by default under the Creative Commons CC-BY-3.0 license (which allows anyone to reuse the material as long as the original author is named), but authors were also able to choose the CC-BY-NC-3.0 license (which prohibits commercial reuse) or traditional "all rights reserved" copyright protections instead.
Knol employed "nofollow" outgoing links, using an HTML directive to prevent links in its articles from influencing search engine rankings.
Reception.
Competition.
Knol has been described both as a rival to encyclopedia sites such as Wikipedia, Citizendium, and Scholarpedia and as a complement to Wikipedia, offering a different format that addresses many of Wikipedia's shortcomings. The non-profit Wikimedia Foundation, which owns the name Wikipedia and the servers hosting the Wikipedia projects, welcomed the Google Knol initiative saying that "The more good free content, the better for the world." While Wikipedia articles are written collectively under a "neutral point of view" policy, Knol will highlight personal expertise by emphasizing authorship and, like articles provided on Squidoo, HubPages, and Helium.com, Knol pages will contain the personal opinions of the author.
Despite the official Wikimedia response and the differences in format, former Wikimedia Foundation chair Florence Devouard expressed concern over Knol's potential threat to Wikipedia in terms of the competition it would create. After Knol's beta launch, Google product manager Cedric Dupont responded to the idea that Google intended Knol to be a "Wikipedia killer" by saying, “Google is very happy with Wikipedia being so successful. Anyone who tries to kill them would hurt us.” The "New York Times" noted similarities in design between Knol and Wikipedia, such as use of the same font. Dupont responded that the use was simply a coincidence as it is a commonly used font.
Because of Knol's format, some said Knol would be more like About.com than Wikipedia. According to Wolfgang Hansson, a writer at DailyTech, Knol may have been planned for About.com originally when it was up for acquisition. Hansson reported that several sources close to the sale said Google was planning to acquire About.com, but the executives at About.com learned Google was planning to move from About.com's model to a wiki-style model. That would have meant layoffs for all 500 or so "Guides" at About.com.
Conflict of interest.
There has been debate whether Google search results can remain neutral because of possible conflict of interest. According to Danny Sullivan, the editor of "Search Engine Land", "Google’s goal of making Knol pages easy to find on search engines could conflict with its need to remain unbiased." Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, raised similar concerns: "At the end of the day, there's a fundamental conflict between the business Google is in and its social goals. What you're seeing here, slowly, is Google embracing an advertising-driven model, in which money will have a greater impact on what people have ready access to." As a response to such concerns it has been pointed out that Google already hosts large amounts of content in sites like Google Sites, YouTube, Blogger and Google Groups and that there is no significant difference in this case. Nicholas G. Carr, a frequent technology commentator, dismissed predictions of Google manipulating results saying that Google is hoping the most popular Knol pages will rise naturally through the search results, challenging Wikipedia and providing another area of content that can carry Google ads.
Since Google's announcement in December 2007, there has also been speculation on its motives and its position as a producer of content rather than as an organizer. "The Guardian"'s Jack Schofield argued that "Knol represents an attack on the media industry in general."
Closure.
In November 2011 Google announced that Knol would be phased out. Content could be exported by owners to the WordPress-based Annotum. Knol was closed on April 30, 2012, and all content was deleted by October 1, 2012. Between these dates the content was not viewable, but was downloadable and exportable.

Nazi human experimentation

Nazi human experimentations were a series of medical experiments on large numbers of prisoners, mainly Jews (including Jewish children) from across Europe, but also in some cases Romani, Soviet POWs and disabled non-Jewish Germans, by Nazi Germany in its concentration camps mainly in the early 1940s, during World War II and the Holocaust.
Prisoners were coerced into participating; they did not willingly volunteer and there was never informed consent. Typically, the experiments resulted in death, disfigurement or permanent disability, and as such are considered as examples of medical torture.
At Auschwitz and other camps, under the direction of Eduard Wirths, selected inmates were subjected to various hazardous experiments which were designed to help German military personnel in combat situations, develop new weapons, aid in the recovery of military personnel that had been injured, and to advance the racial ideology backed by the Third Reich. Aribert Heim conducted similar medical experiments at Mauthausen. Carl Værnet is known to have conducted experiments on homosexual prisoners in attempts to cure homosexuality.
After the war, these crimes were tried at what became known as the Doctors' Trial, and revulsion at the abuses perpetrated led to the development of the Nuremberg Code of medical ethics.
Experiments.
According to the indictments at the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials, these experiments included the following:
Experiments on twins.
Experiments on twin children in concentration camps were created to show the similarities and differences in the genetics of twins, as well as to see if the human body can be unnaturally manipulated. The central leader of the experiments was Josef Mengele, who from 1943 to 1944 performed experiments on nearly 1,500 sets of imprisoned twins at Auschwitz. About 200 individuals survived these studies. The twins were arranged by age and sex and kept in barracks between experiments, which ranged from injection of different dyes into the eyes of twins to see whether it would change their color to literally sewing twins together in attempts to create conjoined twins.
Bone, muscle, and nerve transplantation experiments.
From about September 1942 to about December 1943 experiments were conducted at the Ravensbrück concentration camp, for the benefit of the German Armed Forces, to study bone, muscle, and nerve regeneration, and bone transplantation from one person to another. Sections of bones, muscles, and nerves were removed from the subjects without use of anesthesia. As a result of these operations, many victims suffered intense agony, mutilation, and permanent disability.
Head injury experiments.
In mid-1942 in Baranowicze, occupied Poland, experiments were conducted in a small building behind the private home occupied by a known Nazi SD Security Service officer, in which "a young boy of eleven or twelve strapped to a chair so he could not move. Above him was a mechanized hammer that every few seconds came down upon his head." The boy was driven insane from the torture.
Freezing experiments.
In 1941, the "Luftwaffe" conducted experiments with the intent of discovering means to prevent and treat hypothermia. There were 360 to 400 experiments and 280 to 300 victims indicating some victims suffered more than one experiment. One study forced subjects to endure a tank of ice water for up to five hours.
Another study placed prisoners naked in the open air for several hours with temperatures as low as −6 °C (21 °F). Besides studying the physical effects of cold exposure, the experimenters also assessed different methods of rewarming survivors. ""One assistant later testified that some victims were thrown into boiling water for rewarming"" 
The freezing/hypothermia experiments were conducted for the Nazi high command to simulate the conditions the armies suffered on the Eastern Front, as the German forces were ill-prepared for the cold weather they encountered. Many experiments were conducted on captured Russian troops; the Nazis wondered whether their genetics gave them superior resistance to cold. The principal locales were Dachau and Auschwitz. Dr Sigmund Rascher, an SS doctor based at Dachau, reported directly to Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler and publicised the results of his freezing experiments at the 1942 medical conference entitled "Medical Problems Arising from Sea and Winter". Approximately 100 people are reported to have died as a result of these experiments.
Malaria experiments.
From about February 1942 to about April 1945, experiments were conducted at the Dachau concentration camp in order to investigate immunization for treatment of malaria. Healthy inmates were infected by mosquitoes or by injections of extracts of the mucous glands of female mosquitoes. After contracting the disease, the subjects were treated with various drugs to test their relative efficiency. Over 1,000 people were used in these experiments and more than half died as a result.
Mustard gas experiments.
At various times between September 1939 and April 1945, many experiments were conducted at Sachsenhausen, Natzweiler, and other camps to investigate the most effective treatment of wounds caused by mustard gas. Test subjects were deliberately exposed to mustard gas and other vesicants (e.g. Lewisite) which inflicted severe chemical burns. The victims' wounds were then tested to find the most effective treatment for the mustard gas burns.
Sulfonamide experiments.
From about July 1942 to about September 1943, experiments to investigate the effectiveness of sulfonamide, a synthetic antimicrobial agent, were conducted at Ravensbrück. Wounds inflicted on the subjects were infected with bacteria such as "Streptococcus", "Clostridium perfringens" (the causative agent in gas gangrene) and "Clostridium tetani", the causative agent in tetanus. Circulation of blood was interrupted by tying off blood vessels at both ends of the wound to create a condition similar to that of a battlefield wound. Infection was aggravated by forcing wood shavings and ground glass into the wounds. The infection was treated with sulfonamide and other drugs to determine their effectiveness.
Sea water experiments.
From about July 1944 to about September 1944, experiments were conducted at the Dachau concentration camp to study various methods of making sea water drinkable. At one point, a group of roughly 90 Roma were deprived of food and given nothing but sea water to drink by Dr. Hans Eppinger, leaving them gravely injured. They were so dehydrated that others observed them licking freshly mopped floors in an attempt to get drinkable water.
Sterilization experiments.
The Law for the Prevention of Genetically Defective Progeny was passed on 14 July 1933, which legalized the involuntary sterilization of persons with diseases claimed to be hereditary: weak-mindedness, schizophrenia, alcohol abuse, insanity, blindness, deafness, and physical deformities. The law was used to encourage growth of the Aryan race through the sterilization of persons who fell under the quota of being genetically defective. 1% of citizens between the age of 17 to 24 had been sterilized within 2 years of the law passing. Within 4 years, 300,000 patients had been sterilized. From about March 1941 to about January 1945, sterilization experiments were conducted at Auschwitz, Ravensbrück, and other places by Dr. Carl Clauberg. The purpose of these experiments was to develop a method of sterilization which would be suitable for sterilizing millions of people with a minimum of time and effort. These experiments were conducted by means of X-ray, surgery and various drugs. Thousands of victims were sterilized. Aside from its experimentation, the Nazi government sterilized around 400,000 individuals as part of its compulsory sterilization program. Intravenous injections of solutions speculated to contain iodine and silver nitrate were successful, but had unwanted side effects such as vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, and cervical cancer. Therefore, radiation treatment became the favored choice of sterilization. Specific amounts of exposure to radiation destroyed a person’s ability to produce ova or sperm. The radiation was administered through deception. Prisoners were brought into a room and asked to complete forms, which took two to three minutes. In this time, the radiation treatment was administered and, unknown to the prisoners, they were rendered completely sterile. Many suffered severe radiation burns.
Experiments with poison.
Somewhere between December 1943 and October 1944, experiments were conducted at Buchenwald to investigate the effect of various poisons. The poisons were secretly administered to experimental subjects in their food. The victims died as a result of the poison or were killed immediately in order to permit autopsies. In September 1944, experimental subjects were shot with poisonous bullets, suffered torture and often died.
Incendiary bomb experiments.
From around November 1943 to around January 1944, experiments were conducted at Buchenwald to test the effect of various pharmaceutical preparations on phosphorus burns. These burns were inflicted on prisoners using phosphorus material extracted from incendiary bombs.
High altitude experiments.
In early 1942, prisoners at Dachau concentration camp were used by Sigmund Rascher in experiments to aid German pilots who had to eject at high altitudes. A low-pressure chamber containing these prisoners was used to simulate conditions at altitudes of up to 20,000 m (66,000 ft). It was rumored that Rascher performed vivisections on the brains of victims who survived the initial experiment. Of the 200 subjects, 80 died outright, and the others were executed.
Aftermath.
Many of the subjects died as a result of the experiments conducted by the Nazis, while many others were murdered after the tests were completed to study the effect post mortem. Those who survived were often left mutilated, suffering permanent disability, weakened bodies, and mental distress. On 19 August 1947, the doctors captured by Allied forces were put on trial in "USA vs. Karl Brandt et al.", which is commonly known as the Doctors' Trial. At the trial, several of the doctors argued in their defense that there was no international law regarding medical experimentation.
The issue of informed consent had previously been controversial in German medicine in 1900, when Dr. Albert Neisser infected patients (mainly prostitutes) with syphilis without their consent. Despite Neisser's support from most of the academic community, public opinion, led by psychiatrist Albert Moll, was against Neisser. While Neisser went on to be fined by the Royal Disciplinary Court, Moll developed "a legally based, positivistic contract theory of the patient-doctor relationship" that was not adopted into German law. Eventually, the minister for religious, educational, and medical affairs issued a directive stating that medical interventions other than for diagnosis, healing, and immunization were excluded under all circumstances if "the human subject was a minor or not competent for other reasons" or if the subject had not given his or her "unambiguous consent" after a "proper explanation of the possible negative consequences" of the intervention, though this was not legally binding.
In response, Drs. Leo Alexander and Andrew Conway Ivy drafted a ten point memorandum entitled "Permissible Medical Experiment" that went on to be known as the Nuremberg Code. The code calls for such standards as voluntary consent of patients, avoidance of unnecessary pain and suffering, and that there must be a belief that the experimentation will not end in death or disability. The Code was not cited in any of the findings against the defendants and never made it into either German or American medical law.
Modern ethical issues.
Contemporary knowledge concerning the manner in which the human body reacts to freezing is based almost exclusively on these Nazi experiments. This, together with the recent use of data from Nazi research into the effects of phosgene gas, has proven controversial and presents an ethical dilemma for modern physicians who do not agree with the methods used to obtain this data. Similarly, controversy has arisen from the use of results of biological warfare testing done by the Imperial Japanese Army's Unit 731. However, the results from Unit 731 were kept classified by the United States until the majority of doctors involved were given pardons.

Post-election pendulum for the Australian federal election, 2010

The following pendulum is known as the Mackerras Pendulum, invented by psephologist Malcolm Mackerras. Designed for the outcome of the 2010 federal election, the pendulum works by lining up all of the seats held in Parliament, 72 Labor, 72 Coalition, 1 Nationals WA, 1 Green and 4 independent, according to the percentage point margin on a two candidate preferred basis. The two party result is also known as the swing required for the seat to change hands. Given a uniform swing to the opposition or government parties in an election, the number of seats that change hands can be predicted. Swing is never uniform, but in practice variations of swing among the Australian states usually tend to cancel each other out. Seats are arranged in safeness categories according to the Australian Electoral Commission's classification of safeness. "Safe" seats require a swing of over 10 per cent to change, "fairly safe" seats require a swing of between 6 and 10 per cent, while "marginal" seats require a swing of less than 6 per cent.

NAACP Youth Council

The NAACP Youth Council is a branch of the NAACP in which youth are actively involved. In past years, council participants organized under the council's name to make major strides in the 1950s and 1960s Civil Rights Movement. Started in 1935 by Juanita E. Jackson, special assistant to Walter White and the first NAACP Youth secretary, the NAACP National Board of Directors formally created the Youth and College Division in March 1936.
Claudette Colvin, the first person to refuse to give up her seat on the bus in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955, was a member of the local Council. In 1957-59, Lyman T. Johnson led the Louisville chapter's Youth Council to open downtown stores to African Americans; and in the early 1960s the Louisville NAACP Youth Council led the boycotts called the "Nothing New for Easter" campaign that, with numerous arrests of juveniles with no previous jail records, forced over 80 percent of Louisville merchants to integrate their stores. The 1958 Oklahoma City Lunch-counter Sit-in, guided by activist Clara Luper, was organized by the local Youth Council. 
The NAACP Youth Council is composed of hundreds of state and county-wide operations in which youth (usually teens) volunteer to share their voices or opinions with their fellow council members, and then strive to address the issues raised on a local or national level. Sometimes this volunteer work expands to an international scale. Today there are over 600 NAACP Youth Councils, high school chapters and college chapters addressing issues of social justice including education, economic empowerment, health, juvenile justice, and civic engagement. 
Mission.
"The mission of the NAACP Youth & College Division shall be to inform youth of the problems affecting African Americans and other racial and ethnic minorities; to advance the economic, education, social and political status of African Americans and other racial and ethnic minorities and their harmonious cooperation with other peoples; to stimulate an appreciation of the African Diaspora and other people of color’s contribution to civilization; and to develop an intelligent, militant effective youth leadership"

Girart de Vienne

Girart de Vienne is a late twelfth-century (c.1180) Old French "chanson de geste" by Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube. The work tells the story of the sons of Garin de Monglane and their battles with the Emperor Charlemagne and it establishes the friendship of the epic heroes Olivier and Roland.
The poem comprises more than 6000 rhymed decasyllable verses grouped into laisses. It was likely based on a now lost earlier poem. The work was extremely popular up until the Renaissance, and was converted into a version with alexandrines (14th century) and five prose versions, including one by David Aubert (in his "Chroniques et conquestes de Charlemagne"), one by Raffaele Marmora, one by Jean d'Outremeuse, and one attached to the prose version of "Garin de Monglane."
Plot.
In the beginning, each of the four sons of Garin de Monglane—Hernaut, Girart, Renier and Milon—comes into possession of a fief (Renier becomes the father of Olivier). But the son of Hernaut, Aymeri, becomes enraged when he hears the Empress bragging about how she once had humiliated his uncle Girart, and he incites the brothers to battle. In an attempt to end the war, Olivier is pitted against the nephew of the Emperor, Roland, in a duel near Vienne, but neither hero prevails and, when night comes, an angel tells the two heroes to save their strength for battling infidels. The two swear each other eternal friendship and Roland proposes to Olivier's sister, Aude. Girart is reconciled with his emperor, but before Roland and Aude's marriage can take place, a messenger announces the arrival of Saracens in Gascony.
The "three cycles".
This work is also famous for grouping the "chansons de geste" or "Matter of France" into three cycles, each named after a chief character or ancestral figure: the "Geste du roi" (concerning Charlemagne and his knights), the "Geste de Doon de Mayence" (concerned with rebels against royal authority and its most famous characters were Renaud de Montauban and Girart de Roussillon), and the "Geste de Garin de Monglane" (whose central character was William of Orange; these dealt with knights who were typically younger sons without an inheritance who sought land and glory through combat with the Saracens).

Indrani Rahman

Indrani Rahman (September 19, 1930, Chennai - February 5, 1999, New York) was an Indian classical dancer, of Bharata Natyam, Kuchipudi, Kathakali and Odissi, which she popularized in the west, and later settled in New York in 1976.
In 1952, she won the Miss India pageant. Later, she joined her mother Ragini Devi's company. She popularized the Indian classical dance form, Odissi during her international tours. Indrani had received the Padma Shri in 1969 and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in the performing arts and also the Taraknath Das Award.
Early life.
Indrani Rahman was born in Chennai, (then Madras) to Ramalal Balram Bajpai (1880–1962), an Indian nationalist and president of the Indo-American League, and Esther Luella Sherman born in Petoskey, Michigan in 1893, (died 1982), who changed her name to 'Ragini Devi', once the couple moved to India, in 1920s, when Ramlal Bajpai, a chemist turned successful importer in US, returned to India and later remained Asst. Editor to the "Young India" magazine, published by Lala Lajpat Rai; after Independence of India, he became the Consulate General of India at New York. Ragini on her part became renowned all over the world for her role in revival of Indian classical dance in the 1930s, especially Kathakali, after her fateful encounter with the great rajadasi, Jetti Tayamma in Karnataka, from whom she started learning Bharata Natyam, and also from Gauri Amma of Chennai.
Career.
Indrani started learning dance in her mother’s company, at age nine, and accompanied her as she travelled through, Americas, and Europe. Professionally, she first started with Bharata Natyam, having learnt the Pandanallur style of Bharata Natyam from Guru Chokkalingam Pillai (1893–1968) in 1940s. Soon she was in Vijaywada, learning Kuchipudi from Korada Narsimha Rao with whom she later toured may parts of the world.
In 1947, Indrani attracted the attention of India's leading dance and art critic Dr. Charles Fabri, who later encouraged her to go to Orissa and learn the little-known classical dance form of Odissi, making her the first professional dancer to learn Odissi. After learning Odissi for three years, from Guru Sri Deba Prasad Das, she went on to popularize it, through performance in various parts of India and the world.
In 1952, already married, and with a child, she became the first Miss India, and went on to compete in the Miss Universe 1952 Pageant, held at Long Beach, California. Soon, she was travelling along with her mother and performing all over the world. In 1961, she was the first dancer presented on a national tour by the Asia Society, and also performed for US President John F. Kennedy and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, during Nehru's official visit to Washington, D.C., and in the following years she also performed for Emperor Haile Selassie, Queen Elizabeth II, Mao Zedong, Nikita Khrushchev, and Fidel Castro. In 1976 she became a faculty member of the dance division at the Juilliard School at New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, taught in various American universities, including Harvard, and spent her remaining two decades in the United States, touring extensively.

British Board of Film Classification

The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), originally British Board of Film Censors, is a non-governmental organisation, funded by the film industry and responsible for the national classification and censorship of films within the United Kingdom. It has a statutory requirement to classify videos, DVDs and, to a lesser extent, some video games under the Video Recordings Act 2010.
History and overview.
The BBFC was established in 1912 as the British Board of Film Censors by members of the film industry, who would rather manage their own censorship than have national or local government do it for them. It began operating on 1 January 1913. Its legal basis was the Cinematograph Act 1909, which required cinemas to have licences from local authorities. The Act was introduced for safety reasons after a number of nitrate film fires in unsuitable venues (fairgrounds and shops that had been hastily converted into cinemas) but the following year a court ruling determined that the criteria for granting or refusing a licence did not have to be restricted to issues of health and safety. Given that the law now allowed councils to grant or refuse licences to cinemas according to the content of the films they showed, the 1909 Act therefore enabled the introduction of censorship. The film industry, fearing the economic consequences of a largely unregulated censorship infrastructure, therefore formed the BBFC in order to take the process 'in house' and establish its own system of self-regulation. Some decisions from the early years are now subjected to derision. In 1928, the Board's examiners report famously claimed that Germaine Dulac's surrealist film "The Seashell and the Clergyman" was "Apparently meaningless" but "If there is a meaning, it is doubtless objectionable".
Informal links, to varying degrees of closeness, have been maintained between the BBFC and the Government throughout the Board's existence. In the period before World War II, an extensive but unofficial system of political censorship was implemented by the BBFC for the Home Office. As the cinema became a socially powerful mass-medium, governments feared the effect of its use by others for propaganda and as happened in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany discouraged any expression of controversial political views in British films. This trend reached its climax during the 1930s. Following protests from the German Embassy after the release of a film depicting the execution of Edith Cavell ("Dawn", 1928, dir. Herbert Wilcox), intense political pressure was brought to bear on the BBFC by the Home Office. A system of script vetting was introduced, whereby British studios were invited to submit screenplays to the BBFC before shooting started. Interestingly, imported Hollywood films were not treated as strictly as British films, as the BBFC believed that audiences would recognise American cinema as representing a foreign culture and therefore would not apply any political messages therein to their own lives. So while the Warners gangster films and other 1930s Hollywood films that dealt explicitly with crime and the effects of the Great Depression were released in the UK largely uncut, these subjects were strictly off-limits for British film-makers.
During World War II, the BBFC's political censorship function effectively passed to the Films Division of the Ministry of Information, and the BBFC never regained this to the same extent as before the war. The increasing climate of post-war liberalism ensured that from the 1950s onwards, controversies involving the BBFC centred more on depictions of sex and violence than on political expression. There were some notable exceptions: "Yield to the Night" (UK, 1956, dir. J. Lee Thompson), which opposed capital punishment; "Room at the Top" (UK, 1959, dir. Jack Clayton), which dealt with class divisions; "Victim" (UK, 1961, dir. Basil Dearden), which implicitly argued for the legalisation of homosexuality, all involved the BBFC in controversy.
In 1984 the organisation changed its name to "reflect the fact that classification plays a far larger part in the Board's work than censorship". At that time it was given responsibility for classifying videos for hire or purchase to view in the home as well as films shown in cinemas. Home video and cinema versions of a film usually receive the same certificate, although occasionally a film may receive a more restrictive certificate for the home video market (sometimes due to the bonus features), as it is easier for children to watch a home video than to be admitted into a cinema.
The first video game to be refused classification by the BBFC was "Carmageddon" in 1997, however a modified version of the game was later awarded an 18 certificate. In June 2007, "Manhunt 2" was refused classification in both its PlayStation 2 and Wii versions, meaning that the game was illegal to sell or supply. A modified version was made that was accepted by the ESRB but was still refused classification from the BBFC. The second decision was later overturned by the Video Appeals Committee (an independent body set up by legislation); the BBFC then asked the High Court for a judicial review of the VAC decision. The High Court ruled that the VAC had made errors in law and instructed it to reconsider its decision, the VAC subsequently ruled that the modified version of the game should receive an 18 certificate, which the BBFC accepted.
In 2009, the Japanese horror film "Grotesque" was refused classification, making it illegal to sell or supply on a physical medium in the UK. The 2011 horror film "The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)" was also denied classification, before being heavily cut for an 18.
On 16 June 2009, the UK's Department of Culture, Media and Sport ruled in favour of the PEGI system to be the sole classification system for videogames and software in the UK. This decision will also, unlike beforehand, allow PEGI ratings to be legally enforced much like the BBFC ratings. Initially expected to take effect from 1 April 2011, the legislation was put into effect on 30 July 2012.
Several films rated 'PG-13' in the US by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), generally most equivalent to the '12' and '12A' classifications, have received the more restrictive '15' classification in the UK. Recent examples include "W.", "Couples Retreat", "Easy A", "The Sixth Sense", "Mama" and "Devil". Also, several films rated 'PG-13' in the US have received the less restrictive 'PG' classification in the UK. These include "When in Rome", "Whale Rider", "Saving Mr. Banks","The Simpsons Movie", "The Artist", "Princess Mononoke", "Tales from Earthsea" and "School of Rock". The 2008 film "Meet The Spartans" was passed 12A for its cinema release but it was classified 15 on video due to the gag reel outtakes on the special features but the film itself remains with a 12 certificate for video release.
Responsibilities and powers.
The Board is an independent, governmental organisation. Its business affairs are controlled by a council of management selected from leading figures in the manufacturing and servicing sectors of the film industry. This council appoints the President, who has statutory responsibility for the classification of videos and the Director who has executive responsibility and formulates policy. The Board, which is based in Soho Square, London, is financed from the fees it charges for classifying films and videos and is run on a not-for-profit basis.
In the case of films shown in cinemas, local authorities have the final legal authorisation over who can view a particular film. The majority of the time, local authorities accept the Board's recommendation for a certificate for a film. There have been some notable exceptions – particularly in the 1970s when the Board allowed films such as "Last Tango in Paris" and "The Exorcist" to be released with an X certificate (essentially the same as today's "18") – but many local authorities chose to ban the films regardless. Thirty-nine local authorities in the UK either imposed an outright ban, or effectively banned by imposing X certificate, on "Monty Python's Life of Brian", which the BBFC had rated as AA (14).
Conversely, in 2002, a few local authorities, apparently under pressure from distributors and cinema chains, ignored the BBFC's ruling that "Spider-Man" receive a 12 rating, and allowed children younger than 12 to see the film. However, the BBFC were already in the process of replacing the 12 rating with a new 12A, which allowed under-12s to see the film if accompanied by an adult, so shortly afterwards, "Spider-Man" was reclassified as 12A. The first 12A certificate awarded was for "The Bourne Identity".
Local authorities do not have such power for video recordings. Under the Video Recording Act 1984, all non-exempt recordings must be classified by an authority chosen by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. This classification is legally binding, in that supply of material contrary to its certificate (recordings that have been refused a certificate, or supplying to someone younger than the certified age) is a criminal offence. However, possession is not an offence in itself, other than in the case of "possession with intent to supply". Since the introduction of the Act, the BBFC has been the chosen authority. In theory this authority could be revoked, but in practice such a revocation has never been suggested, since most local authorities simply don't have the resources needed to do such things as remove cuts, pass films that the BBFC rejected and vice versa, put in place new cuts, etc., regularly.
The BBFC has also rated some video games. Normally these are exempt from classification, unless they depict human sexual activity, human genital organs or gross acts of violence, in which case the publishers should submit the game for classification. Publishers may opt to submit a game for classication even if they are not obliged to. In December 1986, the first computer game to receive a 15 certificate from the BBFC was an illustrated text adventure called "Dracula", based on the Bram Stoker novel, published by CRL. The first computer game to receive an 18 certificate, on 11 December 1987, was another illustrated text adventure called "Jack The Ripper", also by CRL, which dealt with the infamous real life murders in Victorian London. The horror in both games came through largely in their detailed prose. Had the game publishers reprinted the games' text in book form, it would not have carried a certificate, as the BBFC has no oversight over print media. Both games had numerous certificate stickers all over their covers to emphasise to parents and retailers that they were not intended for children, as computer games carrying BBFC certificates were previously unheard of.
The BBFC rates theatrically released films, and rates videos and video games that forfeited exemption from the Video Recordings Act 1984, which was discovered in August 2009 to be unenforceable until the act was re-enacted by the Video Recordings Act 2010. Legally, local authorities have the power to decide under what circumstances films are shown in cinemas, but they nearly always choose to follow the advice of the BBFC.
The Video Recordings Act requires that video releases not exempt (music, documentary, non-fiction, video games, etc.) under the Act had to be classified, making it illegal to supply any recording that had not been certified. Certificates could restrict release to any age of 18 or under, or to only licensed sex-shops. The government currently designate the BBFC as the authority for certifying video releases. As the law requires the certificate to be displayed on the packaging and media labels of the video recording, in practice only UK releases can be legally sold or hired in the UK, even if a foreign release had identical content.
Under the Digital Economy Act 2010, the responsibility for rating video games in the United Kingdom has passed from the BBFC to the Video Standards Council. A game is only submitted to the BBFC if it contains strong pornographic material or if it includes video material that is not directly accessible through the game itself (e.g. a documentary).
The BBFC also provide a classification service for mobile phone operators. BBFC guidelines for film and video are used to calibrate the filters used by the operators to restrict access to internet content. The default assumption is that mobile phone users are under 18 years of age. The BBFC guidelines are based on public consultations conducted every 4-5 years.
All films rated by the BBFC receive a certificate, along with "consumer advice" detailing references to sex, violence and coarse language. If a certificate specifies that a film or video game is only suitable for someone over a certain age, then only those over that age may buy it.
The BBFC can also advise cuts for a less-restrictive rating. This generally occurs in borderline cases where distributors have requested a certificate and the BBFC has rated the work at a more-restrictive level; however, some cuts are compulsory, such as scenes that violate the Protection of Children Act 1978 or Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937. The final certificate then depends on the distributor's decision on whether or not to make the suggested cuts. Some works are even rejected if the distributor refuses the cut.
The examiners and the directors of the BBFC are hired on a permanent basis. Examiners are required to watch 5 hours 20 mins of media, to a maximum of 35 hours a week. Turnover is low and vacancies, when available, appear on its London job vacancies website.
Current certificates.
The BBFC currently issues the following certificates. The category logos were introduced in January 2003, replacing the previous ones that had been in place since 1982.
Material that is exempt from classification sometimes uses symbols similar to BBFC certificates, for example an E "certificate". There is no legal obligation, nor a particular scheme, for labelling material that is exempt from classification. On the BBFC's online classification database, material that has been refused a classification uses a red serif R in place of a rating symbol.
Attitudes to censorship.
Historically the Board has faced strong criticism for an over-zealous attitude in censoring film. Prior to the liberalising decade of the 1960s, films were routinely and extensively censored as a means of social control. For example, "Rebel Without a Cause" was cut to reduce the "possibility of teenage rebellion". Ingmar Bergman's "Smiles of a Summer Night" was cut to remove "overtly sexual or provocative" language.
The BBFC's attitude became more liberal during the 1960s, and it concentrated on censoring films that featured graphic sex and violence. However, some Board decisions caused controversy in the 1970s when it banned a series of films that were released uncut and were popular in other countries (such as "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" and "Last House on the Left"), or released other controversial films, such as "Straw Dogs" and "A Clockwork Orange". However, under recent President Andreas Whittam Smith and current incumbent Sir Quentin Thomas, guidelines have been relaxed again, allowing the release, usually uncut, of these previously banned films on video and in cinemas. Some films from the 1970s remain unreleased, but many of these titles remain banned primarily because their distributors have not chosen to re-submit the films to the BBFC, almost certainly for commercial reasons. If they were, they would be likely to receive a more sympathetic hearing than 30 to 40 years ago. Two notable examples from this period include the 1969 film "Love Camp 7", rejected in 2002, and "Women in Cellblock 9", released in 1977 and rejected in 2004. Both films contain substantial scenes of sexual violence and have remained completely banned following a re-submission since 2000.
In general, attitudes to what material is suitable for viewing by younger audiences have changed over the years, and this is reflected by the reclassification of older films being re-released on video. For example, a 1913 film given the former A rating could very probably be rated PG today. An extreme example of this is the rating of the horror film "Revenge of the Zombies", with a U certificate upon its video release in the late 1990s, whereas, when it was first examined as a film in 1951, it was given one of the first X ratings. The Bela Lugosi horror film "Island of Lost Souls" was refused a certificate when first submitted in 1932, and granted an X in the 1950s - when submitted for modern video classification in 2011, it was re-classified as a PG.
The BBFC are also known to cut the words 'spaz', 'moron' and 'retard' from U and PG certified films and videos on the grounds of discrimination (though "spaz" and "moron" aren't considered as derogatory in the United States as they are in the United Kingdom: "spaz" in American slang means "someone who overreacts to a minor problem" while "moron" is used as a synonym for "idiot." "Retard," however, has been censored on some American TV shows for being derogatory). One example of this was when "Marmaduke" was passed U after the word 'spaz' was removed. The uncut version is rated 12A. They also award higher ratings to films that contain potentially imitable and dangerous behaviour; this includes all three "Jackass" films being passed 18, and "" being passed 12A. They are also very serious about suicide themes, references, or attempts, and will either cut them or award a higher rating. An example of this was in 2010, when the Board cut the Hindi film "Anjaana Anjaani" by two minutes and thirty-one seconds for a cinema 12A certificate in order to remove references to and sight of someone attempting suicide by asphyxiation. The cut footage was put back into the film for its video release, which was passed 18. "The Hunger Games" was assessed before formal classification, with the film's studio wishing to obtain a 12A for financial and marketing reasons. In order to get this, 7 seconds of footage was cut and blood splashes were digitally removed from four scenes, as an alternative to the uncut film being rated 15.
Relaxation.
There has been considerable relaxation since 1999 onwards. The relaxation of guidelines has also made hardcore pornography widely available to adult audiences through the R18 rating. Films with this rating are only legally available from licensed sex shops, of which there are about 300 in the UK. They may also be seen in specially licensed cinemas.
Recent examples include the passing of "Irreversible", "Romance", "Antichrist", and numerous other films uncut for cinema and video viewing. Despite this trend towards liberalisation, anti-censorship campaigners are still critical of the BBFC. It has attracted criticism from conservative press, in particular the "Daily Mail", on the grounds that the release of sexually explicit and violent films was corrupting the nation. The newspaper's most famous clash with the BBFC came in 1997 when the Board released the David Cronenberg film "Crash" without cuts. The following day (19 March 1997) the "Mail" led with the banner headline "CENSOR'S YES TO DEPRAVED SEX FILM" Westminster City Council imposed its own ban on the film after the decision, although anyone wanting to watch the film only had to walk along to the non-Westminster half of Shaftsbury Avenue - that is in the neighbouring borough of Camden - to see it in a cinema there.
Current concerns.
The BBFC's current guidelines identify a number of specific areas considered when awarding certificates or requiring cuts. These are discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or mental or physical disability, adult themes, language (i.e., profanity), nudity, sexual content, violence, sexual violence, dangerous actions that can easily be imitated by younger, more naive viewers (certain combat moves and neck-breaking in particular, all visual and verbal references to suicide, detailed criminal acts as breaking into a house using a credit card to jimmy the lock or hotwiring a car, or actions that result in injury or death in real life, but are almost always shown in the media with no negative consequences—such as hiding in appliances that can trap and kill small children tumble driers and old refrigerators, ingesting or misusing common household chemicals, or creating dangerous devices from common household items as a flamethrower from an aerosol can and a cigarette lighter -- fall under this category), horror and disturbing content, and drug abuse being condoned or glamorized.
The BBFC also continues to demand cuts of any material it believes breaches the provisions of the Obscene Publications Act or any other legislation (most notably the Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937 forbids the depiction of animals being abused or in distress and the Protection of Children Act 1978 as amended, forbids the depiction of minors engaged in sex or in sexually suggestive poses or situations). In 2009, 2% of cinema films had material cut, and 3.6% of videos. Most cuts actually occur in videos rated for 18 or R18, rather than videos intended for viewing by under-18s. In 2009, 16.8% of 18 videos, and 27.3% of R18 videos, had material cut.
There is no theme or subject-matter that is considered inherently unsuitable for classification at any level, although more controversial topics might require a restricted certificate. This is in keeping with current practice in most liberal democracies, but in sharp contrast to the early days of the BBFC when such themes as prostitution, incest and the relations of capital and labor were unacceptable in any circumstances.
'Adult' or 'strong' language can earn a film a more restrictive certificate, though BBFC policy states that there are no constraints on language use in films awarded an 18 certificate. It is difficult to compare the BBFC's policies in this area with those in other countries as there are different taboos regarding profanity in other languages and indeed in other English-speaking countries. For example, the use of 'strong' language has little effect on a film's classification in France. The BBFC's policy proved particularly controversial in the case of Ken Loach's "Sweet Sixteen" in 2002, which was passed uncut only at 18 certificate, even though its main characters were teenagers who frequently used profanities that the director argued were typical of the social group his film depicted. The film received similar certificates in Ireland (also an 18 certificate) and the United States. Shane Meadows' film "This Is England" was also passed uncut only at 18 due to its repeated use of racist terms, and the climatic scene where Combo becomes irate and pummels his friend Milky while insulting him. On the other hand, some films feature strong language but nevertheless do not carry particularly restrictive certificates. "The King's Speech" was passed for a 12A rating despite its repeated use of the word "fuck" in two scenes, which would normally raise the rating to a 15 certificate; the BBFC justified its decision, saying that the profanity was "in a speech therapy context".
There are minimal restrictions of the depiction of non-sexual nudity, which is allowed in even U and PG certificate films (for example, "The Simpsons Movie"—which was given a PG-13 rating in the U.S. – was given a PG certificate in the UK, leaving the sequence where Bart skateboards naked through town and his genitals are shown through an open space in a hedge unedited), but scenes of (simulated) sexual activity are limited to more restricted certificates. With regard to material that is intended primarily as pornographic the Board's policy, as stated on its website is "Material which appears to be simulated is generally passed ‘18’, while images of real sex are confined to the ‘R18’ category." However, for some years depictions of real sex have been allowed in 18 certificate videos intended as educational, and in recent years a number of works such as Catherine Breillat's "Romance", Patrice Chéreau's "Intimacy" and Michael Winterbottom's "9 Songs", which feature apparently unsimulated sex have been passed uncut for theatrical release.
Violence remains one of the most problematic areas for censorship in the UK, especially when it's in conjunction with sex or likely to sway more impressionable viewers into thinking the violence depicted is "glamorous" or "fun" and "risk-free." However, the Board takes into account issues of context and whether it considers scenes of sexual violence to "eroticise" or "endorse" sexual assault. In 2002, the board passed Gaspar Noé's "Irréversible" uncut, but less than a month later cut Takashi Miike's "Ichi the Killer" by three and a quarter minutes to remove scenes of sexual violence. "A Serbian Film" suffered from forty-nine individual cuts by the BBFC, which totalled to four minutes and eleven seconds of cuts. The cuts were made to remove "portrayals of children in a sexualised or abusive context and images of sexual and sexualised violence which have a tendency to eroticise or endorse the behaviour" as the Board's website states.
Criminal and dangerous acts that can be easily imitated, as well as scenes condoning, glamorising, or showing clear instruction of how to abuse drugs have also been the subject of UK editing. The issue of depicting dangerous acts that can easily be imitated in real life is one that does not seem to figure especially highly in the censorship systems of most other countries (though the U.S. has done this on occasion, often as the result of public backlash, as seen on the MTV shows "Beavis and Butt-head" and "Jackass"). In the UK, numerous minor cuts have been made, primarily to films whose distributors want a PG or 12A certificate, to scenes of characters performing acts that would be considered dangerous, criminal, or harmful if done in real life. For example, in 2006, issues involving suicide by hanging became problematic; "The Ren and Stimpy Show" Series 1 DVD set (classified PG) was edited to remove the song "The Lord Loves a Hangin'" because the song implied that hanging is "comedic, fun, and risk-free". "Paranoia Agent" Volume 3 DVD set (classified 18) was also cut to remove the depiction of a child nearly hanging herself for the same reason.
The requirement to have films classified and censored can cost film producers up to thousands of pounds. The North West New Wave, a blanket term recently used by both film makers and local press to describe independent filmmakers in the Northwest of England, is currently campaigning for the introduction of a Voluntary 'Unrated 18' Certificate in the UK.
On 6 June 2011, the BBFC refused a classification for the horror film "The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)". The previous film in the series was passed uncut at 18, but due to a shift in context and focus, the BBFC judged that the sequel could fall foul of the Obscene Publications Act. The film was eventually passed 18 after cuts were made.
Leadership.
Directors of the BBFC.
During James Ferman's time, the title of the chief executive officer at the BBFC changed from "Secretary of the Board" to the current "Director". At the same time, the title card displaying a film's certificate, which opens all theatrically screened films in the United Kingdom, stopped carrying the chief executive's signature. The President's signature is now used instead.

Sooty was originally devised by Harry Corbett (nephew of Guiseley fish and chip shop chain owner Harry Ramsden ), who bought the puppet as a present for his son, Matthew Corbett, from a stall when he was on holiday in Blackpool in 1948. 
Sooty, a small yellow bear with black ears and nose, is mute to the audience but can communicate with his operator by apparently whispering in his ear. He first appeared on screen on the BBC in 1952 on the BBC's "Talent Night". This particular show came from the TV Theatre at the annual "British Radio Show" held on this occasion at Belle Vue, Manchester. For ten days there had been nightly heats of hopefuls in the theatre culminating in each of the winners performing live on the Saturday night variety show transmitted nationally. Harry Corbett won his heat and then, by public vote, the overall winner on the live TV show. Sooty and Harry then became regulars on the BBC children's show "Saturday Special" from 1952-1955. 
The original bear was completely yellow, and Harry covered his ears and nose with soot so that he would show up better on black and white television - hence the puppet's name. He would later be joined by other puppet characters Sweep (a dog who communicates by a saxophone reed type squeak), Soo (a shy and sweetly spoken panda), Kipper (a cat), Butch (another dog who occasionally plays the part of a villain), Ramsbottom (a snake), 'Enry the Robot, Cousin Scampi (another bear), Miki (another cat - this time Brazilian) and Maggie Mouse. Like Sooty, Scampi appears to talk only in a very light whisper which can be heard only when someone puts their ear close to his mouth.
Matthew Corbett.
Following Harry Corbett's retirement in 1976, Sooty was operated by Corbett's son Matthew, and enjoyed a new wave of popularity on stage and TV. "The Sooty Show" continued until 1992, evolving into a sitcom format. Like his father, Matthew took on a paternal role to the puppets, sharing a house with Sooty, Sweep, Soo (and latterly little cousin Scampi) and becoming the butt of many practical jokes. Matthew developed a well-meaning but slightly conceited screen character, whose boasting and pomposity was frequently punctured by the mayhem caused by Sooty and Sweep.
Connie Creighton, who with her husband John had worked with Harry Corbett and Sooty for many years, continued to work on the programme, and co-starred in several episodes as well as touring with the stage show. 
In 1993 Sooty, Sweep, Soo, Little Cousin Scampi and Matthew all moved to Manchester for "Sooty & Co.", with the gang running a shop that "sells almost everything". Brenda Longman, the voice of Soo since the early 1980s, co-starred as neighbour Mo.
Richard Cadell.
Matthew Corbett retired in 1998, bequeathing Sooty to then co-star Richard Cadell, who presented the show through another five series, at first under the name "Sooty Heights", then under the name, "Sooty", both set at a hotel. He was joined in these by two female co-hosts, starting with Liana Bridges from 1999-2000 who worked in "Sooty & Co." in the same period he did, and then Vicki Lee Taylor from 2001–2004. Cadell, who is a life-long enthusiast of Sooty, said it was a dream come true to be able to own the rights to Sooty. 
Repeats of "Sooty Heights" & "Sooty" were shown on the CITV channel between 2006 and 2010.
In June 2008 it was announced that Richard Cadell had bought the rights to Sooty, which had been put up for sale by HIT Entertainment in October 2007. Plans for three new TV show formats - a sitcom-style show similar to previous series, featuring the gang working at a handyman agency, a live variety show and a pre-school game show - were under way, plus a reworking of one of Matthew Corbett's stage shows. A brand new Sooty adventure, "Sooty's Big Day Out", was released on DVD and was made available via the official Sooty Show website.
A new 26-part series is currently airing on CITV and is set in a holiday camp with Richard Cadell as the caretaker.
Characteristics.
Sooty's personality fluctuates between kindness, cheekiness, and downright naughtiness, very often misinterpreting things said or suggested by Harry, Matthew, Richard or Soo (possibly intentionally). He plays an instrument described in the show as a "xylophone" which is in fact a toy glockenspiel, and keeps a wand with which he performs magic. This is accompanied by the catchphrase "Izzy wizzy, let's get busy!", and then Sooty tapping the magic wand to "Shave and a Haircut".
His water pistol is also iconic, with Matthew and Richard usually on the receiving end of a soaking, although even royalty have fallen foul of the water. Sooty has also hit both Matthew and Richard with a hammer in some episodes, to which they have always shouted, "Don't do that for goodness sake!"
Matthew and Richard carried on Harry's tradition of ending every show with the line "Bye bye everybody, bye bye", and in Matthew's last ever episode, his final scene was a collection of him saying the immortal words over the preceding years.
TV series.
The Sooty Show was first aired on the BBC in 1955 until 1967 where it was cancelled by the BBC and was changed to Thames Television and aired on ITV from then until the end of the TV series in 1992. In 1957, Sooty was joined by Sweep, and in 1964, Soo was introduced as Sooty's girlfriend. The latest series, simply titled "Sooty", began on 5 September 2011 on the CITV channel.
There were also three spin-off series.
"Sooty's Amazing Adventures" was an animated cartoon series that aired from 1996-1997. It featured Sooty, Sweep, Soo and Scampi living in an old theatre by the coast. It was produced by award winning animation company Cosgrove Hall Films. The show gave Sweep and Scampi actual voices, but kept Sooty mute. When Richard Cadell acquired the rights to Sooty, he destroyed the master tapes to this series.
"Learn with Sooty" was a straight-to-video series developed to make learning fun and introduce the basic skills that children really need to understand. There were eight videos produced; Start to Read, Have Fun with Numbers, Simple Science, Be Safe, Start to Read 2, A to Z of Animals, Down on the Farm and Have Fun with Numbers 2. In 1995, three of the videos (Start to Read, Have Fun with Numbers and Be Safe) were re-released with new packaging.
"Sooty's Magic" was also a straight-to-video series that taught basic magic tricks for children to learn and practice themselves, with each release ending with a magic show presented by Sooty and Richard Cadell. The videos were supported by a range of "Sooty's Magic" toys. Three videos were released between 2000 and 2002; Sooty's Magic Show, Sooty's Magic Club and Sooty's Magic Birthday Party. Due to Hit Entertainment's takeover of Gullane Entertainment at the time, the final video, Sooty's Magic Birthday Party, never received a wide release, with only those who pre-ordered the video receiving their copy.
Stage shows.
Sooty also had a successful number of (mainly Christmas) stage shows across the UK.
During Matthew Corbett's reign, seven stage shows were performed repetitively. For the first half of the tours, Matthew and Connie Creighton would present, and during the second half, while Matthew was busy writing and filming the TV shows, Connie and Spencer K. Gibbens would present.
After Matthew retired, six stage shows toured the country. All starring Richard Cadell, three of them also featured Richard's "Sooty Heights" co-star, Liana Bridges, with the fourth starring Amanda Howard in Liana's place.
From 2005 to 2008, annual shows, featuring the puppet characters and various different presenters, toured around the UK.
From 2009, stage shows again featured Richard Cadell. The first, "Sooty in Space", was a reworking of one of Matthew Corbett's scripts, and toured the country throughout the year.
Books.
In the early to mid-1960s, there were at least five Sooty annuals published by the London "Daily Mirror". These features an expanded cast of characters including:
A Sooty annual also appeared in 1991-92.
Discography.
In 1973 a single and album was released. The single was "Super Sonic Sooty Spug" with "My Friend and I" on the B-side. The album was "Around the World with Sooty...Harry Corbett and Sweep". This comprised eight songs with a linking story. The songs included both the A and B-sides of the single. These were released on the Music for Pleasure label.

Dance Love Pop

Dance Love Pop is the third studio album by Swedish recording artist Agnes, released originally on October 29, 2008 in Sweden. This was Agnes' first studio album since 2006 and her comeback to the music stage. The album is written and produced by Swedish song-writer Anders Hansson and geared towards the dance and club genre. When released the first single "On and On" it immediately showed a clear change of artistic direction for her music. This was clearly observed by the critics who all homaged her new musical style. In Sweden, a deluxe edition of the album titled "Dance Love Pop: The Love Love Love Edition" was released, featuring the original 10 tracks plus new song "Love Love Love", of which Agnes competed with in the Swedish drafts for Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow. The deluxe edition also included remixes and music videos of the album's singles and re-entered the official Swedish Top 60 Album Chart peaking at number 12. A re-release of the album was also made in France, where the ""Edition Collector"" was released on January 18, 2010 and peaked at forty-seven.
The album originally peaked at five in Sweden and the deluxe edit at twelve, in France it stayed on the charts for twenty-nine weeks and peaked at thirty-eight in the physical chart and forty-three in the digital chart. In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the album was released by Warner Music and it peaked at sixty-eight in Germany, at seventy in Austria and at forty-five in Switzerland. In the UK it peaked at 13 on the Dance Chart.
Background and development.
The name of the album was first revealed on September 13, 2008 on Swedish radio show "Tracks", the host, Kaj Kindvall declared that the name would be "Dance! Love! Pop!". The spelling with exclamation marks after each words was later dispatch by the label Roxy Recordings and changed to merely ""Dance Love Pop"". The album was described as follow: ""it covers the three things that the music is all about [...]; dance music that has a twist of pop and is about love"".
With this album, Agnes together with her producer and fellow song-writer geared towards the dance and club genre. Agnes recalls when Hansson's name first came up for the album "“They said maybe you should just meet first and see if you like each other, as opposed to just working together.”" They got on – so well that Hansson ended up producing an album that helped Agnes realize her vision, Dance Love and Pop together in one album "“A lot of things changed for me when I started to work with this album. I really liked it, because I knew that I wanted to do something totally different to the two others. I wanted to do uptempo, disco-orientated songs and I really wanted to work with Anders because he felt the same way.""
For the international release of the album, some of the songs were remastered and remixed. The second UK single, "I Need You Now", was entirely re-recorded for its release. For the German market, a new song called "You Rain" was recorded and "Big Blue Wall" was remixed. Agnes is also due to record a couple of new songs for the US release of the album. A few new tracks have been added for the international release, "You Rain", "Secret Love" and "If I Could Build My Whole World Around You". For the francophone market the French version of "Release Me", called "Réalise" was also included. Just like "I Need You Now", another ballad called "Big Blue Wall" has been re-recorded in to a dance-music version called "the Moonwalker version" and is featured on the album as well as the original version from the Swedish release which is renamed "the Piano version".
Chart performance.
The album entered the Swedish official chart on November 6, 2008 just a few days after it was released on October 28. It entered at five and that was also its peak, the following weeks it started to fall and left the chart after nine weeks to later re-enter it in late April due to the re-release of the album, the "Love Love Love Edition", and peaked at twelve. After staying on the chart for another six weeks it left it for good with a total of fifteen weeks. In France it entered and peaked the French Albums Chart on September 12, 2009 at thirty-eight and stayed on the chart for a total of twenty-nine weeks leaving on April 24, 2009. As in Sweden, a re-release of the album was made called the ""Edition Collector"". The first version of the album stayed on the chart for fifteen weeks and the latter stayed there for fourteen weeks peaking at forty-seven.
In Germany the album peaked at sixty-eight with sales of 20,000 copies, and in Austria and Switzerland it peaked at seventy and forty-five. In Poland it peaked at fourteen and in the United Kingdom it peaked at 112 on the official charts and peaked at 13 on the dance albums chart.
Singles.
"Release Me", was the last song to be recorded for "Dance Love Pop" since the record company felt that the album would need another track. It was chosen as the lead single internationally, except from Sweden and the Netherlands where "On and On" was the lead single. It became the album's best-selling and most popular single, and peaked at number one in the "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Play. The song also peaked high on the charts all over Europe, such as number 3 the UK Singles Chart selling almost 400,000 copies, and 7 in the French Singles Chart. The single sold "Gold" in Australia, Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Italy; "Silver" in the United Kingdom and "Platinum" in Norway.
The second international single, "On and On", was released as the follow-up to "Release Me" with massive expectations. The song managed to chart in the French and Swiss Singles Charts even before its release, in digital sales from the album only. It did also chart in Sweden, Denmark and Belgium. In the UK, "On and On" was rejected as the second single though is was meant from the start as Agnes' follow up in the UK and Ireland. The song was later released at the third single in the UK and peaked at #82 in the official charts and #10 on the dance chart. In Sweden, this was the single that announced Agnes comeback and forthcoming album.
The third single from the album was "Love Love Love" and was only released in Sweden. The song was Agnes' entrant in Sweden's Eurovision Song Contest selection process Melodifestivalen. After proceeding to the final from the fourth semi-final, the song placed eighth out of the eleven entries. "Love Love Love" is written by Anders Hansson and was released as a one track CD single by Roxy Recordings. It peaked at four on the Swedish Official Single Chart.
"I Need You Now" was the fourth single in Sweden, the third in Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy and the second single in the United Kingdom, Norway and Australia. On the original track listing of Dance Love Pop this song was a ballad, the solution was to re-record it as a dance-music song for the single release. The song failed to match the success of its predecessors and only charted at number 40 in the UK. In Sweden it peaked at eight, in Slovakia at fifteen, in Belgium at twenty (Flanders) and two (Wallonia) and in Ukraine at one.
The album's fifth single was "Sometimes I Forget", it was released in France as the third single in mid-2010 and in Italy as the fourth single.
Critical reception.
Sandra Wall from Norrköpings Tidningar writes ""she makes an album that fits the dance floor at any club. A mood trigger with bubbling enjoyment."" and ""Agnes has been keeping great standard since she won Idol, but now when she's increased the tempo, it becomes really great. The lyrics is about messy relationships and aren't that deep. Which fits perfectly on the dance floor.""
""Don't let you be fooled by the childish cover, it's passably fallacious"" says Anneli Wikström in Metro, she also writes that the album is ""far from bubblegum and children's party"" and says that it's unexpectedly mature and an eye wink with the 80's. Lisa Appelqvist from Kristianstadsbladet compares Agnes to Madonna and Whitney Houston. She says ""With her reincarnated voice from the divas of the 70's she burst out "Release Me". Hansson's craft work almost breaths Madonna's "Like a prayer" with gospel/cello and Agnes haplessly frustrated pray."" She continues with ""Only 21 years old and I have a feeling that Agnes has a lot to offer us in the future. [...] Agnes Carlsson once and for all gets rid of the "Idol"-dust."" Göteborgsposten's Johan Rylander says that the cooperation with Anders Hansson is ""the improvement Agnes aspired for since she won Idol 2005. The bombastic Celine-ballads are gone and modern dance-pop of great quality (like Release me) have replaced it.""

Cal Poly Pomona College of Environmental Design

The Cal Poly Pomona College of Environmental Design (CENV) is a college part of the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona). The college houses over 1,600 students; making it one of largest environmental design programs in the United States. The college offers bachelor's degrees in five departments, as well as three master's degree programs. It is the only academic unit within the California State University system to be associated with a Pritzker Prize laureate (often referred to as "The Nobel Prize in Architecture").
History.
The planning programs at Cal Poly Pomona evolved from the undergraduate landscape architecture program that originally was part of the School of Agriculture. After approval of the creation of a new School of Environmental Design, the landscape and urban planning programs moved into their current building in January 1971. The Department of Urban Planning was created and soon after a Department of Architecture. Department of Urban Planning was renamed "Department of Urban and Regional Planning" in 1983 to reflect an expanded program. The School was renamed the "College of Environmental Design" in 1988. The Department of Art was transferred to Environmental Design from the College of Arts in 1992.
In 1978, the College was briefly led by Richard Saul Wurman, founder of the TED (conference) and given credit for coining the term "information architect".
In 2005, in a project called Prioritization and Recovery, university president J. Michael Ortiz proposed breaking up the college, promoting the Department of Architecture to a School within the College of Engineering, moving the Department of Landscape Architecture and the Department of Urban and Regional Planning to a proposed College of Agriculture, Natural and Environmental Sciences, and moving the Art Department to the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. In response to student, faculty and alumni backlash and unanimous college consensus against the proposal, the project was abandoned.
The college is housed in several buildings around campus including Building 7, designed by modernist architect Carl Maston, and the IDC (Interim Design Center), a design studio building at the east end of the campus. Current plans are for a new Environmental Design Center on the north side of University Drive at the northwest corner of the campus.
Academic programs and departments.
Architecture.
The Department of Architecture is a member of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture. The Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) and the Master of Architecture (M.Arch) programs are accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board. Along with its sister campus program at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, they are the only two public and professional Bachelor of Architecture degrees in the state of California. The undergraduate program was ranked 16th nationally in the 2014 edition of "America's Best Architecture & Design Schools" published by the journal "DesignIntelligence" and was in the top 20 in the 2011 survey. In 2009, the program was named one of three schools in the nation that excel in sustainable design by Arch Ed 2009 published by Architecture (magazine). The program has been "impacted" since its inception over 40 years ago, with many more students applying than can be accommodated. In 2002 the department admitted 15 percent of undergraduate applicants making it the 5th most selective Bachelor of Architecture program in the country. By 2007 the department's acceptance rate was down to 9 percent, or 225 out of 2,551 applicants, of which 100 enrolled.
Due to the design studio based structure of the program, the student to faculty ratio is a relatively low 17 to 1. Prior to graduation students are required to complete a 500 hour internship of which 250 have to be under a licensed architect.
Unlike the more technically focused program at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, the department is able to tap into the design talents of Los Angeles area architects. Notable and influential 20th century architects that have taught at the department include Richard Neutra, Raphael Soriano Craig Ellwood, Richard Saul Wurman, Thom Mayne,James Pulliam and Ray Kappe, who together with Bernard Zimmerman founded the program in 1968. After a falling out with university administrators, a group went on to form the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc) in 1972. Other past and present faculty include:
Landscape architecture.
The Bachelor of Science in Landscape Architecture (BSLA) is a general professional degree, nationally accredited by the American Society of Landscape Architects. The undergraduate and graduate program both ranked 10th nationally by "DesignIntelligence" 2014. The department's students won 5 out of 20 awards from the American Society of Landscape Architects student competition in 2008, more awards than Harvard and University of Pennsylvania. Longtime faculty member Takeo Uesugi designed the George and Takaye Aratani Japanese Garden adjacent to the CLA building on campus. In 2005, the college awarded Jack Dangermond, a department graduate and Forbes 400 richest persons in America, an honorary degree. Due to the design studio based structure of the program, the student to faculty ratio is a relatively low 16 to 1.
Urban and regional planning.
The Bachelor of Science in Urban and Regional Planning is designed for students interested in working with the critical issues of social, environmental, and physical change in cities and regions. Student to faculty ratio is 24 to 1. In 2008, the program was ranked 21st in the nation for Best Urban & Regional Planning graduate program amongst all private and public schools, according to Planetizen, an online publication for the urban planning, design and development community and 2nd best for programs without a Ph.D.
Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies.
Located on within the Cal Poly Pomona University campus, the Center researches and demonstrates a wide array of regenerative strategies including low-energy architecture, energy production technology, water treatment, organic agriculture, ecological restoration and sustainable community development. Up to 20 students can choose to reside in one of two dormitories on site. The center offers a Minor in Regenerative Studies and a Master of Science degree in Regenerative Studies. The center became the first carbon neutral facility in the California State University system.

Donald J. Russell

Donald Joseph McKay Russell (January 3, 1900 – December 13, 1985) was an American railroad executive. He was president of Southern Pacific Railroad from 1952–1964 and then chairman from 1964–1972. Russell was featured on the cover of Time on August 11, 1961 and Forbes on November 1, 1965.
Early life and education.
Russell was born in 1900. He attended Stanford University, but left in 1918 to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force in World War I; during the war, he was badly injured in a plane crash, and subsequently returned to California.
Career.
In 1920, Russell started with Southern Pacific, a railroad company, and held a wide variety of positions within the company; he started as a timekeeper. From 1923 to 1926, he was in charge of double tracking the railroad line over the Sierra Nevada mountains; in 1926 and 1927, he was in charge of rehabilitation of the railroad line between Grass Lake in Northern California, and Kirk, Oregon, and construction of a new railroad terminal at Klamath Falls and Crescent Lake, Oregon.
In 1937 he became Assistant to the General Manager at Southern Pacific's headquarters in San Francisco; in 1939, he became Superintendent of the Los Angeles Division. In this period, he held many executive positions; in 1941, he became Assistant to the President of Southern Pacific and subsequently Vice President; in 1943, he was promoted to Director; in 1951 to Executive Vice President; and in 1952, he became the organization's president. On December 1, 1964, he became Southern Pacific's chairman.
One of the most noteworthy events during his tenure was how Southern Pacific handled the so-called "Passenger Problem" during the 1960s. Russell was accused of deliberately sabotaging the service his passenger trains provided so that he could pull Southern Pacific out of the passenger business. Robert Jochner, Passenger Department Director for Southern Pacific denied this saying the only reason that Russell downgraded service was not so much to get rid of the passenger trains, but to make sure they made money. Nevertheless, many passenger trains, some very famous, were discontinued under Russell's tenure as President and Chairman of the Board.
While he was in leadership positions, Southern Pacific began a $3 billion modernization program, which included full locomotive dieselization. Southern Pacific also diversified to non-rail operations, including truck and piggy-back services; petroleum and coal slurry pipelines; and communications services. In 1952, Russell directed rescue efforts for passengers stranded on the "City of San Francisco" when it was marooned by record snow in the Sierra. Also in 1952, Russell led the reconstruction of 25 miles of line in 25 days after an earthquake in the Tehachapi Mountains.
Russell also funded research and development; he served as a member of the Stanford University Board of Trustees and was also a long-time board member of the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), and helped connect technical challenges at Southern Pacific with researchers at SRI starting with a project to design a new coupling system in 1954, resulting in the development of the SRI Hydra-Cushion freight car, designed by William K. MacCurdy. Later research would result in the still-used train-tracking TOPS computer system. Russell retired in 1972 and died in 1985.

Henry G. Bieler

Henry G. Bieler (April 2, 1893 – October 11, 1975) was a prominent American physician, best known for his book "Food is Your Best Medicine", which advocated the treatment of disease with foods. He is widely recognized as a pioneer in alternative medicine who used non-pharmaceutical, diet-based therapies to cure or control various diseases including asthma, diabetes, and cancer. In his private life he was an outdoorsman, musicologist, and accomplished artist.
Biography.
Henry Bieler was born in 1893 in Milford, Ohio. In about 1905 his family moved to Cincinnati. He studied medicine at the Ohio-Miami Medical College and graduating with his MD in 1916. He started his medical practice in West Virginia's coal region, moving to Twin Falls, Idaho in about 1922, followed by Pasadena, California in 1926, before settling permanently in Capistrano Beach, California in 1954. Bieler practiced medicine for more fifty years, and gained a reputation as a gifted healer who was able to cure or control difficult health conditions. He died in his home in 1975.
Early career.
As a medical student Bieler suffered from severe asthma, but none of his professors were able to help him. This affliction continued into his early career, growing worse with time. In 1923, the year after he moved to Idaho, he met Agustin Levinson, a professor from Malta, who traveled and gave lectures on human dietary habits. While taking the professor to view the Twin Falls, Bieler had a massive asthma attack. Professor Levinson waited for the attack to pass, then explained what he believed was the cause and how to cure it by diet. Levinson’s cure worked, and he is credited as the person who first aroused Bieler's interest in diet therapy. Bieler began using diet as the main tool for himself and, increasingly, for treating his patients. Levinson and Bieler corresponded until the late 1940s, exchanging books and other materials. It was through him that Bieler learned of John H. Tilden in Denver and later of Wegner in Redlands, California. Bieler studied their books on diet therapy for various ailments, and became interested in biochemistry and nutrition. A chair in Preventive Medicine was named in their honor at Columbia University's College of Physicians & Surgeons, in the Department of Medicine.
Approach to treatment.
Bieler believed that the human body has an inherent capacity for health, and that disease can be cured through proper nutrition. He did not believe that germs are the primary cause of disease (see germ theory), but rather that germs accompany disease as a result of disturbed function. Bieler believed that disturbed function was the result of poor lifestyle, especially consuming improper food, and that disease could be cured through therapeutic diet.
Famous patients.
Bieler's reputation of success using diet to treat disease attracted numerous celebrity patients. Among these were Gloria Swanson, Jeanette MacDonald, Anthony Quinn, Greer Garson, Hedda Hopper, Greta Garbo and Lucille Ball. Hedda Hopper, whom he treated for exhaustion, is quoted on the back cover of "Food is Your Best Medicine" (1st edition) saying "I’ve known him for twenty-five years and if I’d always taken his advice, I’d never have had a sick day during all that time." While the successes were many, treatment of actress Allison Hayes was associated with a continued decline in health, later found to result from lead contamination in a bone meal supplement. This case was pivotal in prompting the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate food supplements. Although Bieler treated many high profile patients, he shunned participation in celebrity culture, priding himself in treating all who came to him, regardless of social status and fame.
Controversy.
Dr. Bieler was often at odds with the American Medical Association because he believed that drugs are harmful and advised his patients to avoid them.
Publications.
In 1965 Dr. Bieler wrote the book "Food is Your Best Medicine", published by Random House, a compilation of over fifty years of work treating disease by diet. This book, which became a best seller, is still in print (Ballantine Books division of Random House), and has been translated into many other languages. The book was highly controversial at the time. Bieler refused to include any "diets" or recipes in the text because he believed that every person has different body chemistry and, therefore, different needs. In 1972 he wrote a second book, "The Natural Way to Sexual Health", with co-author Sarah Nichols, which did have recipes added by his editor/agent between the time he submitted the manuscript and when the book was published. Bieler's publications and recordings of lectures are archived at the Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation including a Bibliography containing 16 citations. 
At the time of his death in 1975 he was working on a book called "The Incurables", dedicated to the memory of Martin F. Fischer one of his professors from medical school whom he greatly respected. The book dealt with specific diseases like cancer, lupus, diabetes, asthma, epilepsy, gout, and even the common cold. In it, he wrote what he felt caused the disease and how chemistry could be reversed for control or cure. This book was never finished, and remains unpublished.
About the Author, from "Food is Your Best Medicine":
"Dr. Henry G. Bieler studied medicine at the University of Cincinnati, where he came under the lifelong influence of Dr. Martin Fischer, the great physiologist and philosopher. For over fifty years he has been a doctor and great treated motion picture stars, coal miners, politicians and professional men, farmers and Pasadena dowagers. He has brought thousands of healthy babies into the world, including his own children and grandchildren. He himself is his own best example of the person his patient can become."
After his death in 1975 the last sentence was altered to “He died in October 1975”.

Jenkem

Jenkem is, purportedly, a hallucinogenic inhalant created from fermented human waste. In the mid-1990s, it was reported to be a popular street drug among Zambian street children.
In November 2007, anecdotal American media reports created the false impression that jenkem was a popular drug in American schools. Several sources reported that the increase in American media coverage was based on a hoax and "on faulty Internet research." 
Description.
The name derives from Genkem, a brand of glues which had "become the generic name for all the glues used by glue-sniffing children" in South Africa. In the book "Children of AIDS: Africa's Orphan Crisis" by Emma Guest, the making of jenkem is described: "fermented human sewage, scraped from pipes and stored in plastic bags for a week or so, until it gives off numbing, intoxicating fumes." The process is similarly described in a 1995 IPS report: "Human excreta is scooped up from the edges of the sewer ponds in old cans and containers which are covered with a polyethylene bag and left to stew or ferment for a week." A 1999 BBC article refers to "the dark brown sludge, gathering up fistfuls and stuffing it into small plastic bottles. They tap the bottles on the ground, taking care to leave enough room for methane to form at the top."
The effects of jenkem inhalation last for around an hour and consist of auditory and visual hallucinations for some users. In 1995, one user told a reporter it is "more potent than cannabis." A 1999 report interviewed a user, who said, "With glue, I just hear voices in my head. But with jenkem, I see visions. I see my mother who is dead and I forget about the problems in my life." Fumito Ichinose, an anesthesia specialist in Boston who conducted a study on the effects of hydrogen sulfide gas, or "sewer gas," on mice, informed Salon.com that holding your breath, choking, or "the inhalation of gases like those produced from jenkem could result in hypoxia, a lack of oxygen flow to the body that could be alternately euphoric and physically dangerous."
Media reports.
1995–2006.
The first media description of jenkem came from an Inter Press Service wire report in 1995. According to a 1998 report in "The New York Times", Fountain of Hope, a non-profit organization, said that jenkem was used by street children in Lusaka, Zambia to obtain a "powerful high." In 2002, Project Concern International Zambia and Fountain of Hope released a report entitled "Rapid Assessment of Street Children In Lusaka," where jenkem is listed as the third most popular drug among Lusaka's street children, following Dagga (cannabis) and "glue and Dagga" but ahead of "Ballan" (uncured tobacco) and petrol.
John C. Zulu, director of the Ministry of Sport, Youth and Child Development in Zambia, said in November 2007 that jenkem usage is less common than glue-sniffing and, "Initially, they used to get it from the sewer, but they make it anywhere [...] They say it keeps them warm and makes them fearless." In 1999, BBC News ran a story about jenkem. In 2004, South African weekly investigative newspaper "Mail & Guardian" mentioned jenkem abuse in a report on Zambia's street children.
2007 to present.
On September 26, 2007, the Sheriff's Department of Collier County, Florida issued an internal bulletin about jenkem based on a TOTSE internet forum post by user "Pickwick," which included purported photos of the manufacture and use. "Pickwick" confessed it was a hoax around the time of the internal bulletin. In November of that year, officials at the United States Drug Enforcement Agency said no reports of jenkem use had been confirmed in the United States.
After initially classifying stories of Western jenkem use as "undetermined," Snopes quickly reclassified it as "false." About.com also concluded reports were "based on faulty Internet research." The Smoking Gun stated the Collier county alert "may be full of shit". Drug research site Erowid reported, "the jenkem stories that have been circulating in the U.S. media are almost certainly the strange result of a hoax."
Jenkem use was reported uncritically by KIMT of Mason City, Iowa, WIFR-TV in Rockford, Illinois, and WINK NEWS Fort Myers, Florida. "Washington Post" columnist Emil Steiner reported that "a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration insists that 'there are people in America trying ,'" which the DEA agent characterized as "dangerous, bad and stupid." Fox News ran the story after the Steiner "Washington Post" column, mentioning Pickwick's hoax and retraction. In the same article, a Washington D.C. DEA spokesman, Garrison Courtney, specified that, "We wouldn't classify it as a drug so much because it's feces and urine." UK technology tabloid website "The Register" concluded that "the jury's out." ABC News interviewed DEA spokesman Garrison Courtney, who stated that, "It is in Africa, we know that… We've heard rumors and speculation about it here, but part of looking for trends is listening first for speculation. It is something we want to keep on top of."
WSBT-TV in South Bend, Indiana advised parents to "wait up for children at night and not let their kids go to bed until they have seen them and smelled their breath." Austin, Texas NBC affiliate KXAN-TV interviewed a local teen, whose parent speculated on its use: "Once it becomes OK with a certain group of adolescents, it becomes OK with a lot more." Australian broadcaster ninemsn summarized American news reports. A syndicated report published on the web pages of CBS affiliate CBS-47 and Fox affiliate Fox 30, both of in Jacksonville, Florida, reported on jenkem and also referred to it by the slang term ""butt hash"," citing media reports from the "Washington Post", the Drudge Report, and Inside Edition. This was also followed up by a Fox 30 televised news segment, in which Captain Tim Guerrette of the Collier County Sheriff's department was interviewed. A Florida syndicated newspaper article focused on the leaked police memo and included interviews with DEA spokesman Rusty Payne, the Palmetto Ridge High School principal, and a spokeswoman for the Collier County Health Department. 
Jamie Pietras of Salon.com published a long piece on jenkem in 2007. Pietras interviewed a Zambian government official on ways to curtail use and also focused on the Western media scare. Pietras interviewed researcher Earth Erowid of Erowid and Jag Davies the communications director for the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), neither of whom could provide any confirmation of its use in America. Partnership for a Drug-Free America public affairs representative Candice Besson also stated that PDFA had not previously heard about the drug.
"The Enterprise Ledger" of Enterprise, Alabama quoted a local narcotics investigator who believed it was being used in Coffee County, Alabama. A commentary in "The Times-Reporter" of Dover-New Philadelphia, Ohio said jenkem was "largely debunked," but that "someone will be stupid enough to try it." The story was also covered with varying degrees of skepticism in "The Orange County Register", Evansville, Indiana Fox affiliate WTVW, and Wichita, Kansas CBS affiliate KWCH-TV.
In 2009, Bettendorf, Iowa amended its city ordinance regarding illegal inhalants to include organic substances. In 2010, an apartment building in Fort Pierce, Florida was condemned after police found leaking containers of human waste in a unit. One police official speculated the tenant was manufacturing jenkem.
In popular culture.
In the 1996 "War of the Coprophages" episode of the TV series "The X-Files", a teenage boy claimed inhaling methane gas generated by burning manure allowed him to see "reality as it really is." He later dies from self-inflicted wounds.
The Spike program "1000 Ways to Die", aired a 2010 fictional story about a rock-n-roll musician named Cedric, whose recreational drugs run out while his tour bus is being repaired in the Mormon-heavy Provo. After a roadie suggests jenkem, Cedric goes on a bender, culminating in his death by asphyxiation while inhaling methane from a port-a-john.
A two part mini-documentary was made in 2010 by Australian documentarians ViveCoolCity, attempting to recreate and then use, Jenkem, purely from information that US media circulated during the Jenkem scare of 2007. 
In the song "Bloodbath" from GWAR's 2013 album Battle Maximus, lead singer Oderus Urungus refers to his mind being "a muddy mess of Jenkem, crack, and PCP".

Meadhaven United

Meadhaven United is a Jamaican football team which played at the top level, the Jamaican National Premier League, in the 2008/2009 season.
It is based in the Meadowbrook district of Kingston, Jamaica, but need to play their home matches at Constant Spring due to a lack of stands at their Michigan Oval home ground.
History.
The club was founded in March 1977 by a group of 15 year old youngsters from the Meadowbrook and Havendale community. Led by Michael Dyche, Christopher Hunt, George Ballin and Gary Steadman they approached University of the West Indies Student David Hunt to be their coach and he agreed. Playing under the name Meadowbrook United they participated in the President's Cup a qualifying competition for the under 17 Minor League. The team subsequently won their zone and thus qualified for the Minor League the following year.
From this initial success senior footballers were spurred into action and a clubs called Spectrum and Hal-Haven were formed between in late 1977 and early 1978. Hal-Haven coached by David Hunt won the S.D.C Under 19 competition and Spectrum coached by Arthur Clarke won the over 19 competitions. In March 1978 the teams pooled resources and formed the Meadowbrook and Havendale Sports Association and competed under the new name Meadhaven United. The club over the years has produced several national team players at both the junior and senior levels.
They won promotion to the top level in summer 2008 when they won the NPL play-off series ahead of fellow qualifiers, Rivoli United F.C.. During this successful season, in October 2007, founding member, former president and technical director David Hunt died of an apparent heart-attack.
Meadhaven had trouble in attracting sponsorship ahead of their first NPL season. They only lasted one season at the top level, they got relegated after the season's play offs.

USNS Private Francis X. McGraw (T-AK-241)

USNS "Private Francis X. McGraw" (T-AK-241) was a "Boulder Victory"-class cargo ship built at the end of World War II and served the war and its demilitarization as a commercial cargo vessel. From 1946 to 1950 she served the U.S. Army as a transport named USAT "Private Francis X. McGraw". In 1950 she was acquired by the United States Navy and assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service. In 1974 she ended her career and was scrapped.
Victory ship built in California.
"Private Francis X. McGraw" was laid down as "SS Wabash Victory" (MCV hull 796) by the California Shipbuilding Corporation, Los Angeles, California; launched 6 September 1945; sponsored by Mrs. A. Easterbrook; and delivered to the U.S. Maritime Commission 7 June 1945.
World War II-related commercial service.
Operated by the Interocean Steamship Company under General Agency Agreement, "Wabash Victory" carried cargo and passengers to Eniwetok, Ulithi, and Okinawa and, from there, back to the U.S. West Coast between 8 August and 3 November 1945. Employed along the Oregon and California coasts for the next four months, she transited the Panama Canal in mid-March 1946, then headed across the Atlantic Ocean to France. On the 28th, she arrived at Le Havre to begin transporting men and equipment between Europe and the United States.
U.S. Army service.
Two and a half months later, on 14 June 1946, she was transferred to the U.S. War Department but continued her transatlantic runs as an Army transport. Renamed "Private Francis X. McGraw", 31 October 1947, the Victory ship remained a unit of the Army Transportation Service until 1 March 1950.
Service with the MSTS.
The ship was returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission, she was simultaneously transferred to the Navy, given the designation T–AK–241, and assigned to the newly formed Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS). Since that time, "Private Francis X. McGraw", manned by a civil service crew, carried supplies and equipment to "far flung" ports for MSTS, Atlantic. 
Although primarily rotated between Caribbean, North Sea, and Mediterranean runs, she has, when necessary, and particularly from the mid-1960s into 1970, been diverted from such assignments to carry cargo to Pacific Ocean ports. Pacific assignments have included delivery of chemical weapons to Okinawa in 1965 and removing those weapons to Johnston Atoll in 1971 under Operation Red Hat.
Decommissioning.
The vessel was decommissioned and struck from the Navy List at unknown dates. She was transferred to the U.S. Maritime Administration on 8 May 1974 and was sold for scrapping on 21 August 1974.

<doc id="19360156" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19360156" title="Anglophile">
Anglophile

An Anglophile is a person who is fond of English culture. Its antonym is Anglophobe. The word comes from Latin "Anglus" "English" via French, and is ultimately derived from Old English "Englisc" "English" + Ancient Greek "φίλος" - philos, "friend". It gives the first use as occurring in 1867, where the journal "Revue des deux mondes" is described as a "thoroughly Anglophile journal".
The term is not usually associated with citizens of Commonwealth nations (the former British Empire), although these countries share many aspects of culture and history with the UK. Occasionally, it is used to describe the adherence to the culture of the wider Anglosphere such as the South Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Description.
In some cases, Anglophilia represents an individual's appreciation of English history and traditional English culture (e.g. William Shakespeare, Jane Austen, Samuel Johnson, Gilbert and Sullivan). Anglophilia might also be characterized by fondness for the British monarchy and the English system of government and bureaucracy (e.g. the Westminster system of parliament, the Royal Mail), as well as nostalgia for the former British Empire and the English class system. Anglophiles may display adoration of English actors, films, TV shows, radio programs, musicians, books, magazines, fashion designers, cars and/or subcultures.
Anglophiles may use English spellings instead of American spellings, such as 'colour' instead of 'color', 'centre' rather than 'center', 'traveller' rather than 'traveler', etc.. The use of British-English expressions in casual conversation and news reportage has recently increased in the United States. The trend, misunderstanding and misuse of these expressions by Americans has become a topic of media interest in both the United States and England. University of Delaware English professor Ben Yagoda claims that the use of British English has "established itself as this linguistic phenomenon that shows no sign of abating". Lynne Murphy, a linguist at the University of Sussex, notes the trend is more pronounced in the Northeastern United States. The Internet, interest in the Royal family, prominent British journalists working for the American media, a generation that grew up on Harry Potter, and British accents sounding "posh" to Americans have been cited as reasons for this trend.

Credit crunch

A credit crunch (also known as a credit squeeze or credit crisis) is a reduction in the general availability of loans (or credit) or a sudden tightening of the conditions required to obtain a loan from the banks. A credit crunch generally involves a reduction in the availability of credit independent of a rise in official interest rates. In such situations, the relationship between credit availability and interest rates has implicitly changed, such that either credit becomes less available at any given official interest rate, or there ceases to be a clear relationship between interest rates and credit availability (i.e. credit rationing occurs). Many times, a credit crunch is accompanied by a flight to quality by lenders and investors, as they seek less risky investments (often at the expense of small to medium size enterprises).
Background and causes.
There are a number of reasons why banks might suddenly stop or slow lending activity. For example, inadequate information about the financial condition of borrowers can lead to a boom in lending when financial institutions overestimate creditworthiness, while the sudden revelation of information suggesting that borrowers are or were less creditworthy can lead to a sudden contraction of credit. Other causes can include an anticipated decline in the value of the collateral used by the banks to secure the loans; an exogenous change in monetary conditions (for example, where the central bank suddenly and unexpectedly raises reserve requirements or imposes new regulatory constraints on lending); the central government imposing direct credit controls on the banking system; or even an increased perception of risk regarding the solvency of other banks within the banking system.
A credit crunch is often caused by a sustained period of careless and inappropriate lending which results in losses for lending institutions and investors in debt when the loans turn sour and the full extent of bad debts becomes known. Careless lending tends to occur more often in fragmented, competitive credit markets in which lenders may compete with one another for market share and revenue by relaxing standards; by contrast, concentrated credit markets tend to have tighter standards and greater stability.
Financial institutions facing losses may then reduce the availability of credit, and increase the cost of accessing credit by raising interest rates. In some cases lenders may be unable to lend further, even if they wish, as a result of earlier losses.
The crunch is generally caused by a reduction in the market prices of previously "overinflated" assets and refers to the financial crisis that results from the price collapse. This can result in widespread foreclosure or bankruptcy for those investors and entrepreneurs who came in late to the market, as the prices of previously inflated assets generally drop precipitously. In contrast, a liquidity crisis is triggered when an otherwise sound business finds itself temporarily incapable of accessing the bridge finance it needs to expand its business or smooth its cash flow payments. In this case, accessing additional credit lines and "trading through" the crisis can allow the business to navigate its way through the problem and ensure its continued solvency and viability. It is often difficult to know, in the midst of a crisis, whether distressed businesses are experiencing a crisis of solvency or a temporary liquidity crisis.
In the case of a credit crunch, it may be preferable to "mark to market" - and if necessary, sell or go into liquidation if the capital of the business affected is insufficient to survive the post-boom phase of the credit cycle. In the case of a liquidity crisis on the other hand, it may be preferable to attempt to access additional lines of credit, as opportunities for growth may exist once the liquidity crisis is overcome.
A prolonged credit crunch is the opposite of cheap, easy and plentiful lending practices (sometimes referred to as "easy money", "loose credit", or "malinvestment"). During the upward phase in the credit cycle, asset prices may experience bouts of frenzied competitive, leveraged bidding, inducing inflation in a particular asset market. This can then cause a speculative price "bubble" to develop. As this upswing in new debt creation also increases the money supply and stimulates economic activity, this also tends to temporarily raise economic growth and employment.
Often it is only in retrospect that participants in an economic bubble realize that the point of collapse was obvious. In this respect, economic bubbles can have dynamic characteristics not unlike Ponzi schemes or Pyramid schemes.
As John Maynard Keynes observed in 1931 during the Great Depression: "A sound banker, alas, is not one who foresees danger and avoids it, but one who, when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional way along with his fellows, so that no one can really blame him."

Microsoft Entertainment Pack

The original Windows Entertainment Pack (WEP) is a collection of simply-designed 16-bit computer games for Windows. These games were somewhat unusual for the time, in that they would not run under MS-DOS. Many of the games (still compatible with Windows XP) were later released in the Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack. There were four Entertainment Packs in the original series. All games being 16-bit run on modern 32-bit versions of Windows but not on 64-bit Windows, except through a virtual machine.
FreeCell, Minesweeper, Taipei and Chess from this pack were later bundled with Windows.
List of games.
Here is a complete list of the original Microsoft Windows Entertainment Pack titles:
GameSampler.
For much of the early 1990s, the Gamesampler, a subset of the Entertainment Pack small enough to fit on a single high-density disk, was shipped as a free eleventh disk added to a ten-pack of Verbatim blank 3.5" microfloppy diskettes. Games on the sampler included Jezzball, Rodent's Revenge, Tetris, and Skifree. A "Best of" disk of several of the games was also available at times as a mail-in premium from Kellogg's cereals.
32-bit versions.
In the copies of Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 source code which leaked back in 2004, there are 32-bit versions of Cruel, Golf, Pegged, Reversi, Snake (Rattler Race), Taipei and TicTactics. However, FreeCell and Minesweeper have had official 32-bit versions bundled even with early versions of Windows NT. The original game developers of some of the games such as SkiFree, TriPeaks, WordZap now offer 32-bit versions. Third party developers have also created 32-bit freeware clones of Klotski, TetraVex Rodent's Revenge, JezzBall, and Tetris.
Port to the Game Boy Color.
A multicart containing seven games was released for the Game Boy Color as "The Best Of Entertainment Pack". Four of the games on the multi-cart were ported from Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack, while the remaining three were ported from other Microsoft Entertainment Pack compilations.

The World Should Revolve Around Me

"The World Should Revolve Around Me" is the debut single by US R&B duo Little Jackie.
Background.
Speaking in July 2008 to noted UK R&B writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul, Little Jackie frontwoman Imani Coppola explained how the song came about: "Being an artist isn't conducive to having a healthy relationship. And that song is definitely the pinnacle of my ego being bruised by my last partner leaving me! Basically the title represents a very childlike perspective that most people find identifiable... And, while I obviously don't REALLY think the world should revolve around me, I'm basically being defiant in saying 'I don't see the point of a partnership'. While, at the same time, I'm really creating a fantasy for EVERYONE to share and enjoy. You know, why not, at least for a few seconds, just sing along like it's your song? For three minutes of your life let the world revolve around YOU!"
"New York Goes to Hollywood".
"The World Should Revolve Around Me" gained popularity in the U.S. after becoming the theme song for VH1's "New York Goes to Hollywood". Little Jackie also appeared in an episode of the show.
Chart performance.

Durham County Football Association

The Durham County Football Association (also simply known as the Durham FA) is the governing body of football in the County Durham, including Darlington, Gateshead, Hartlepool, South Tyneside, Stockton-on-Tees, and Sunderland. The Durham FA was founded on 25 March 1883 and is the governing body for football in Durham from grass roots to professional level. They also run a number of cups for teams of all levels across the county, leagues for under-18, under-21 and ladies teams, and an under-18 representative team.
History.
In 1879 the joint Durham and Northumberland Football Association was founded and they stayed that way until 1883 when increasing numbers and travel problems for the clubs necessitated a change. On 11 May 1883, 40 clubs met in the Alexandra Hotel in Newcastle and voted to form an independent body known as the Northumberland Football Association. The Durham clubs followed suit holding a meeting at the Three Tuns Hotel, Durham City, on 25 May 1883. The nine clubs who were represented at that meeting formed the Durham County Football Association.
In its second season 18 clubs took part in the Durham Challenge Cup, the only county cup competition in the country at that time. On the 125 year anniversary in 2007–08, the association organised 11 county cup competitions at various levels and a total of 988 clubs participated. The association now has 2,386 teams and 1,055 referees affiliated and also has a staff of 13, who deal with all issues relating to governance and development of football within the county. In 1883, the staff consisted of a part-time honorary secretary.
The association opened its first rented office at 10 Tenters Terrace, Durham City, on 1 October 1913. In June 1923, it purchased Codeslaw, The Avenue, Durham City, to provide "an office, meeting rooms and residence for the secretary". In 1971, the association moved to larger offices at The Sands, Durham City, which were officially opened by its then President, Arthur Askew. Owing to an increase in staff, another move was required and a custom-built suite of offices was erected at The Riverside, Chester-le-Street, which were officially opened on 9 June 2005 by the association’s president, Frank Pattison, and the chairman of The Football Association, Geoffrey Thompson.
Development.
Durham County FA supports clubs, leagues, and the education sector to up skill the football workforce to ensure, through engaging key partners, that high quality football experiences are available to all regardless of sex, race, disability, geographical location and playing ability.
Durham County FA continues to lead on core football development across the County and engages with external Football Development Officers to deliver a coordinated approach to increasing participation and raising standards. The strengthening of existing partnerships and the creation of new partnerships during 2008–2012 will enable the County FA to focus on its core football development work whilst broadening access through a collaborative approach. 
Governance.
The work of the Governance department involves the day to day running of the County Football Association. The main functions are to provide assistance and advice in all administration matters relating to leagues, cups, clubs, discipline, referees and answer any other general football related queries. 
Disbanded or Amalgamated Leagues.
Leagues that were affiliated to the Durham County FA but have disbanded or amalgamated with other leagues include:

Salafist jihadism

Salafist jihadism (Arabic: ) is a jihadist movement or ideology among Salafi Muslims. The term was coined by scholar Gilles Kepel to describe the beliefs of Salafi who became interested in violent jihad starting in the mid-1990s. Practitioners are often referred to as "Salafi jihadis" or "Salafi jihadists". They are sometimes described as a variety of Salafi, and sometimes as separate from "good Salafis" whose movement is a "precursor" of Salafist jihadism.
History and definition.
Author and academic Gilles Kepel writes that the Salafis whom he encountered in Europe in the 1980s were "totally apolitical". But by the mid-1990s he met some who felt jihad in the form of "violence and terrorism" was "justified to realize their political objectives". The combination of Salafi alienation from all things non-Muslim—including "mainstream European society"—and violent jihad created a "volatile mixture".
"When you're in the state of such alienation you become easy prey to the jihadi guys who will feed you more savory propaganda than the old propaganda of the Salafists who tell you to pray, fast and who are not taking action".
According to Kepel, Salafist jihadism combined "respect for the sacred texts in their most literal form, ... with an absolute commitment to jihad, whose number-one target had to be America, perceived as the greatest enemy of the faith."
Salafist jihadists distinguished themselves from salafis they term "sheikist", so named because—the jihadists believed—the "sheikists" had forsaken adoration of God for adoration of "the oil sheiks of the Arabian peninsula, with the Al Saud family at their head". Principal among the sheikist scholars was Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Baaz -- "the archetypal court ulema ["ulama al-balat"]". These allegedly "false" salalfi "had to be striven against and eliminated," but even more dangerous was the Muslim Brotherhood, who were believed by Salafi Jihadists to be excessively moderate and lacking in literal interpretation of holy texts. Iyad El-Baghdadi describes Salafism as "deeply divided" into "mainstream (government-approved, or Islahi) Salafism", and Jihadi Salafism.
Another definition of Salafi jihadism, offered by Mohammed M. Hafez, is an "extreme form of Sunni Islamism that rejects democracy and Shia rule." Hafez distinguished them from apolitical and conservative Salafi scholars (such as Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani, Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen, Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Baaz and Abdul-Azeez ibn Abdullaah Aal ash-Shaikh), but also from the "sahwa" movement associated with Salman al-Ouda or Safar Al-Hawali.
According to Mohammed M. Hafez, contemporary jihadi Salafism is characterized by "five features" -
According to Michael Horowitz, Salafi Jihad is an ideology that identifies the "alleged source of the Muslims’ conundrum" in the "persistent attacks and humiliation of Muslims on the part of an anti-Islamic alliance of what it terms ‘Crusaders,’ ‘Zionists,’ and ‘apostates.’" 
Al Jazeera journalist Jamal Al Sharif describes Salafi Jihadism as combining "the doctrinal content and approach of Salafism and organisational models from Muslim Brotherhood organisations. Their motto emerged as ‘Salafism in doctrine, modernity in confrontation’".
Antecedents of Salafism jihadism include Islamist author Sayyid Qutb, who developed "the intellectual underpinnings" of the ideology. Qutb argued that the world had reached a crisis point and that the Islamic world has been replaced by pagan ignorance of "Jahiliyyah". 
The group Takfir wal-Hijra, who kidnapped and murdered an Egyptian ex-government minister in 1978, inspired some of "the tactics and methods" used by Al Qaeda.
Numbers.
Journalist Bruce Livesey estimates Salafi jihadists constitute less than 1 percent of the world's 1.9 billion Muslims (i.e. less than 20 million).
Leaders, groups and activities.
Its leaders included Afghan jihad veterans such as the Palestinian Abu Qatada, the Syrian Mustafa Setmariam Nasar, the Egyptian Mustapha Kamel, known as Abu Hamza al-Masri and later Osama bin Laden. The dissident Saudi preachers Salman al-Ouda and Safar Al-Hawali, were held in high esteem by this school.
Murad Al-shishani of the The Jamestown Foundation states there have been three generations of Salafi-jihadists: those waging jihad in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Iraq. As of the mid-2000s, Arab fighters in Iraq were "the latest and most important development of the global Salafi-jihadi movement". These fighters were usually not Iraqis, but volunteers who had come to Iraq from other countries, mainly Saudi Arabia. Unlike in earlier Salafi jihadi actions "a significant constituency of Egyptians" was not among the volunteers. According to Bruce Livesey Salafist jihadists are currently a "burgeoning presence in Europe, having attempted more than 30 terrorist attacks among E.U. countries" from September 2001 to the beginning of 2005".
According to Mohammed M. Hafez, in Iraq jihadi salafi are pursuing a "system-collapse stategy" whose goal is to install an "Islamic emirate based on Sunni dominance, similar to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan." In addition to occupation/coalition personnel they target mainly Iraqi security forces and Shia civilians, but also "foreign journalists, translators and transport drivers and the economic and physical infrastructure of Iraq."
2011.
In 2011, Salafi jihadists were actively involved with protests against King Abdullah II of Jordan, and the kidnapping followed by a swift murder of Italian peace activist Vittorio Arrigoni in Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.
Groups.
Salafist jihadists groups include Al Qaeda, the now defunct Algerian Armed Islamic Group (GIA), and prior to 2009, Kashmir-based Lashkar-e-Taiba. According to Mohammed M. Hafez, "as of 2006 the two major groups within the jihadi Salafi camp" in Iraq were the Mujahidin Shura Council and the Ansar al Sunna Group. There are also a number of small jihadist Salafist groups in Azerbaijan. Jund Ansar Allah is, or was, an armed Salafist jihadist organization in the Gaza Strip. On August 14, 2009, the group's spiritual leader, Sheikh Abdel Latif Moussa, announced during Friday sermon the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Palestinian territories attacking the ruling authority, the Islamist group Hamas, for failing to enforce Sharia law. Hamas forces responded to his sermon by surrounding his Ibn Taymiyya mosque complex and attacking it. In the fighting that ensued, 24 people (including Sheikh Abdel Latif Moussa himself), were killed and over 130 were wounded.
In Syria, the group Jabhat al-Nusra has been described as possessing "a hard-line Salafi-Jihadist ideology" and being one of "the most effective" groups fighting the regime.

Dr. Ikizler's research focuses on the nutritional and metabolic aspects of kidney disease. Specifically, his work involves identifying reliable and practical tests for protein-caloric malnutrition, which is associated with heightened risks of mortality in renal failure patients, and using these tests to assess different treatment strategies. One study established that dialysis changes protein metabolism in such a way as to stimulate protein degradation in muscle and other tissues. Work by Ikizler's team showed that dialysis-stimulated proteolysis is partly induced by inflammation; and that parenteral nutrition during dialysis, as well as exercise during dialysis, can mitigate the defects in protein metabolism. Later papers assessed the effectiveness of oral nutritional supplementation, alone or with resistance exercise.

Bear Shooters

Bear Shooters is a 1930 "Our Gang" short comedy film directed by Robert F. McGowan. It was the 98th (tenth talking) "Our Gang" short that was released.
Plot.
Spud wants to go camping and shoot lots of bears with Jackie, Chubby, and Farina. But his mother has forced him to look after his little brother Wheezer, who has the croup.
In caring for his brother he must periodically apply ointment to his chest. He tells his friends he must stay home and grease Wheezer. He tries to get his sister Mary Ann to do this but she insists on going camping. Spud decides to merely go camping anyway and take both Wheezer and Mary Ann along. The gang all go together in an old dilapidated wagon guided by Dinah The Mule. The trip initially goes smoothly, but after some time two bootleggers who have themselves concealed in the area spot the gang and decide to try to get the gang to leave. One of the bootleggers dresses up like an ape in order to scare the gang away. While he scares the gang, the gang manages to trap the ape. Eventually the gang ends up leaving the forest due to a skunk spraying the area, not the bootlegger in the ape suit.
Notes.
"Bear Shooters" is one of four sound "Our Gang" shorts that fell into the public domain after the copyright lapsed in the 1960s (the other three being "School's Out", "Our Gang Follies of 1938" and "Waldo's Last Stand"). As such, these films frequently appear on inexpensive video and/or DVD compilations.

<doc id="19360300" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19360300" title="Auld Alliance">
Auld Alliance

The Auld Alliance (Scots for "Old Alliance"; "Vieille Alliance" in French) was the alliance between the kingdoms of Scotland and France. The Scots word "auld" meaning "old" has become a partly affectionate term for this periodic alliance between the two countries before the Union of Crowns, whereby the Scottish monarch James VI, acceded to the throne of England (as James I).
The alliance played a significant role in the relations between Scotland, France and England from its beginning in 1295 until the 1560 Treaty of Edinburgh. The alliance was renewed by all the French and Scottish monarchs of that period except for Louis XI. By the late 14th century, the renewal occurred regardless of whether either kingdom was involved in a conflict with England.
The alliance dates from the treaty signed by John Balliol and Philip IV of France in 1295 against Edward I of England. The terms of the treaty stipulated that if either country was attacked by England, the other country would invade English territory, as became evident at the Battle of Flodden Field, 1513. The alliance played an important role in conflicts between both countries and England, such as the Wars of Scottish Independence, the Hundred Years' War, the War of the League of Cambrai and the Rough Wooing.
History.
Although during the Middle Ages various assertions were made that the Franco-Scottish relationship began in the reign of Charlemagne, the Auld Alliance is normally dated to 1295. However, historians such as J. D. Mackie have dated it to 1173, when embassies between William I of Scotland and Louis VII of France supported a rebellion against the English king Henry II. Elizabeth Bonner has also referred to talks of "informal cooperation" between the two countries at this time. An example of this was the invasion of England in 1215 led by Alexander II in support of Robert FitzWalter and the Dauphin Louis, during the First Barons' War.
The dynastic turmoil caused by the death of Scotland's seven-year-old queen, Margaret, left Edward I of England with an irresistible opportunity to assert his authority over Scotland. By 1295 it was clear that Edward was on a course for total subjugation of Scotland. In response the Council of Twelve who had taken over the government of Scotland temporarily, sought alliances wherever they could be found. With France and England close to war following Philippe IV's declaration of England's possession of Gascony forfeit in 1293, alliance with France was a clear course to take. In October 1295, a Scottish embassy to Philippe agreed the Treaty of Paris.
As with all subsequent renewals of what became the Auld Alliance, the treaty slightly favoured France more than Scotland. The French were required to do no more than continue their struggle against the English in Gascony. However, the cost of any outright war between Scotland and England was to be borne entirely by the Scots. Nevertheless, Scotland, as remote and impoverished as it was, was now aligned to a major European power. Even if more symbolic than actual, the benefits of the alliance mattered greatly to Scotland.
In the short term however, the treaty proved to have no protection against Edward whose swift and devastating invasion of Scotland in 1296 all but eradicated its independence. Furthermore the cessation of hostilities between England and France in 1299, followed by the treaty of "perpetual peace and friendship" allowed Edward to devote all of his attention and forces to attacking the Scots. Scotland, in the end, owed its eventual survival to the military acumen and inspiration of Robert the Bruce and the mistakes of Edward II rather than its Auld Alliance with France.
In 1326, Robert the Bruce renewed the alliance, with the Treaty of Corbeil. The motive for this renewal was precautionary more than anything: neither realm seemed to have much to fear from England at the time. This, however, rapidly changed after 1330 when Edward III set out to complete his conquest of Scotland and to reassert his power in France. For the first time the Franco-Scottish alliance had been given a sense of emergency. 
In 1346 Edward overwhelmed French forces at the Battle of Crécy. Two months later David II of Scotland was captured at the Battle of Neville's Cross, in a botched invasion of Northern England. His 11 year absence as Edward's prisoner only increased the internal turmoil and power struggles of Scotland. David II was forced to reach a deal with Edward III to gain his freedom. Even after his release in 1357, David spent most of his remaining reign attempting to further English interests in Scotland.
The alliance was renewed between the two kingdoms in 1371, with the embassy of the Bishop of Glasgow and the Lord of Galloway to France. The treaty was signed by Charles V at the Château de Vincennes on 30 June, and at Edinburgh Castle by Robert II on 28 October. The accession of pro-French Robert II led to the immediate renewal of the alliance, however the benefits to Scotland were mixed. Plans were drawn up in 1385 for a Franco-Scottish invasion of England. This included the dispatch of a small French force to Scotland for the first time. These plans never came to any form of action after the French invasion failed to materialise. The deteriorating relations between France and Scotland were summed up by the French Chronicler Jean Froissart who "wished the King of France would make a truce with the English for two or three years and then march to Scotland and utterly destroy it". 
Yet it was necessity that had driven the two kingdoms together and the need to resist aggressive new Lancastrian Kings of England that kept the alliance together in the 15th century. France was on the brink of surrendering to the forces of Henry V and in 1418 the Dauphin, Charles VII, called on his Scottish allies for help. Between 1419 and 1424 as many as 15,000 Scottish troops were sent to France.
French and Scottish forces together won against the English at the Battle of Baugé in 1421. As it marked the turning point of the Hundred Years War, the significance of this battle was great. However, their victory was a short-lived one: at Verneuil in 1424, the Scots army was defeated. Despite this defeat, the Scots had given France a valuable breathing space, effectively saving the country from English domination.
In addition, in 1429 Scots came to the aid of Joan of Arc in her famous relief of Orléans. Scottish soldiers also served in the Garde Écossaise, the loyal bodyguard of the French monarchy. Many Scottish mercenaries chose to settle in France. Some were granted lands and titles in France.
Through the rest of the 15th century the alliance was formally renewed four times. The eventual victory of France in the Hundred Years War combined with the turmoil in England following the War of the Roses meant that the English threat was greatly reduced thus rendering the alliance almost obsolete. The marriage in 1502 of Henry VIII's sister Margaret to James IV of Scotland appears to have finally ended the Franco-Scottish alliance for good. 
It underwent a dramatic revival in 1512 when it was formally reviewed (as it was again in 1517 and 1548). Both soon petered out but Scotland still suffered badly following the death of James IV and most of his nobles at Flodden in 1513. Periodic Anglo-French and Anglo-Scottish conflict throughout the 15th century continued, but the certainties that had driven the Auld Alliance were disappearing. As Protestantism gained ground in Scotland opinion grew there that favoured closer links with England than with France.
In 1558 the alliance between the two kingdoms was finally revived with the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots to the future Francis II of France. Yet with her exile in 1568 to England, Scotland was transformed by its new king James VI who was heir to the English throne as well as Scotland's. His desire to form close links with England meant that the alliance had outlived its usefulness. In the 1560s, after more than 250 years, formal treaties between Scotland and France were officially ended by the Treaty of Edinburgh. With the Scottish Reformation, Scotland was declared Protestant, and allied itself with Protestant England instead. During the Reformation, the Protestant Lords of the Congregation had rejected the Auld Alliance and brokered English military support with their treaty of Berwick against the French Regent Mary of Guise.
Two hundred Scottish soldiers were sent to Normandy in 1562 to aid the French Huguenots in their struggle against royal authority during the French Wars of Religion. The Garde Écossaise, however, continued until 1830 when Charles X of France abdicated.
Wider influence.
Although principally a military and diplomatic agreement, the alliance also extended into the lives of the Scottish population in a number of ways: including architecture, law, the Scots language and cuisine, due in part to Scottish soldiery within the French army. Part of the influence on law was due to Scots often going to French universities, something which continued up until the Napoleonic Wars. Other intellectual influences from France continued into the 18th century as well. Examples of architectural influence include two Scottish castles built with French castle-building in mind: Bothwell and Kildrummy 
At the height of the alliance, French was widely spoken in Scotland and French still has an influence on the Scots language.
Despite all these exchanges of culture, the leading Scottish historian, J.B. Black, said of the alliance: "The Scot['s...] love for their 'auld' ally had never been a positive sentiment nourished by community of culture, but an artificially created affection based on the negative basis of hatred of England, and merely for the benefits brought by the philosophical theory that "the enemy of my enemy is my friend"."
Legacy.
In a speech which he delivered in Edinburgh in June 1942, Charles de Gaulle described the alliance between Scotland and France as "the oldest alliance in the world". He also declared that:
"In every combat where for five centuries the destiny of France was at stake, there were always men of Scotland to fight side by side with men of France, and what Frenchmen feel is that no people has ever been more generous than yours with its friendship."
In 1995, celebrations were held in both countries for the 700th anniversary of the beginning of the alliance. <br>
In 2011, British historian Dr Siobhan Talbott published the result of her research on this matter and concluded accordingly that the Auld Alliance is actually unrevoked after all.

Noble Savage (album)

Noble Savage is the third studio album of the American heavy metal band Virgin Steele, released in 1986 by Cobra Records. The album was reissued in 1997 on CD by Noise Records with six bonus tracks. The remastered edition of 2008 by Dockyard 1 added two other extra tracks. In May 2011, the album was reissued once more by Steamhammer Records, a subsidiary of SPV with the same track list as the 1997 release, but with an added bonus CD containing 13 additional tracks.
Before the recording of "Noble Savage", original guitarist Jack Starr resigned from the band and was replaced by Edward Pursino, an old friend of DeFeis, whose guitar playing immediately fit very well with Virgin Steele's music and style. Pursino's contribution came also in the form of new musical ideas and compositions, and he is still a mainstay in Virgin Steele's line-up. The band's frontman David DeFeis considers this album one of the most important in the history of the band.
"Noble Savage" was the first album where the band was completely satisfied with its music and sound. It is also the first album on which the current musical style of the band is fully manifested, containing grandiose compositions with multi-layered keyboard sound and more sophisticated arrangements. "Noble Savage" has become one of the most popular Virgin Steele albums and it includes the songs "We Rule the Night" and "Noble Savage", which the band still plays in concert.

Military medical ethics

Military medical ethics (MME) is a specialized branch of medical ethics with implications for military ethics. Both are primarily fields of applied ethics, the study of moral values and judgments as they apply to the specific contexts of medicine and military affairs, respectively. MME encompasses the practical application of ethics by military physicians and other healthcare practitioners to dilemmas in military clinical and public health settings in which the patients may be friendly or enemy personnel or in which civilians are affected by military operations. 
Overview.
Within a garrison (peacetime or non-deployed) setting, precepts of MME may not differ much from medical ethics in a civilian context and usually employ the same decision-making processes. (Military physicians in the United States, for example, are licensed by at least one of the state medical boards and so are required to practice medicine according to the ethical stipulations of that state.) There is an intrinsic dichotomy, however, between medicine’s healing mission and a military’s (sometimes) destructive operations. Because military operations may result in the injury or death of enemy personnel (often deliberately so) and may involve the detention and interrogation of captured enemy personnel, medical ethics considerations for clinical providers assigned or attached to a military unit in a deployment or combat situation cannot always be identical to those in the civilian world. Ethical conflicts may emerge in the tension between responsibilities to the patient and duties to the command structure. The degree to which principles of medical ethics may justifiably be informed by, or even altered to accommodate, issues of national security is controversial.
Historical background.
Discussions of MME often take as a point of departure the lessons to be learned from the perversion of medical practice by military physicians and others in the period leading up to and during World War II in Germany and Japan. They may also entail the more recently revealed Cold War radiation experiments undertaken by the United States government. Such discussions often center upon questions of whether these widely deplored activities of the past can be reasonably compared to present-day military medical ethics dilemmas.

Ralph Graves

Ralph Graves (January 23, 1900 – February 18, 1977) was an American screenwriter, film director and actor who appeared in 93 films between 1918 and 1949. 
Born as Ralph Horsburgh in Cleveland, Ohio, Graves had been featured in 46 films, half of them produced by Mack Sennett, before writing, directing, and starring in "Swell Hogan" (1926), produced by Howard Hughes, whose father once had supported Graves by placing him on the payroll of the Hughes Tool Company between screen assignments, although the actor never worked there. 
Graves and the younger Hughes met on the Wilshire Country Club golf course, and over lunch the actor pitched a film about a Bowery bum that adopts a baby. The plot intrigued Hughes, who had a strong interest in Hollywood, and he invested $40,000 in the project. During filming he sat on the sidelines in order to familiarize himself with the technical aspects of production. The budget eventually doubled, and after seeing the completed film numerous times, Hughes hired Dorothy Arzner to help him re-edit it, but there was little they could do to salvage it. When asked his opinion of it, Hughes' uncle, novelist and film director Rupert Hughes, said, ""It's nothing. No plot. No build up. No character development. The acting stinks. Destroy the film. If anbody sees it, you and that homo Graves will be the laughing stock of Hollywood."" Hughes took his uncle's advice and ordered the screening room projectionist to burn the sole copy. Graves later claimed he and Hughes had engaged in a sexual relationship while collaborating on "Swell Hogan". 
Despite this temporary setback, Graves directed four more films in 1927 and contributed the story or wrote the screenplay for twelve additional films, but most of his career was spent acting. While working for Sennett, Graves met Frank Capra, and the director later cast him in several films, including "Flight", based on a story by Graves, and a series of adventure films in which he was cast opposite Jack Holt.
Graves retired from films in 1949. He died in Santa Barbara, California, aged 77.

David DeFeis

David DeFeis (born January 4, 1961) is an American singer, keyboard player, songwriter and producer. He is the main composer and leader of the heavy metal band Virgin Steele.
Voice & musical style.
David DeFeis is a classically trained pianist, with a Bachelor's degree in composition from S.U.N.Y. Stony Brook. As vocalist he is self taught, possessing a three and a half octave range. 
As a musician and a singer, he declared he was very much influenced by guitar players like Jimmy Page, Brian May and Eddie Van Halen because he wanted to do with his voice what they did with their guitars. 
He is also influenced by rock singers like Freddie Mercury, Robert Plant, David Coverdale, Ronnie James Dio and Ian Gillan.
The major part of the lyrics David DeFeis writes are mythological, dealing with subjects from especially Greek mythology, Sumerian mythology and Christian religion. All of them are based on real life in some form or another.
Biography.
David DeFeis comes from a very theatrical family: his father is a Shakespearian actor who runs the theatre company "The Arena Players Theatre" while his sister Doreen is a gifted opera singer who performs all over Europe. 
Big fan of European classical music, at 9–10 years old he was introduced to rock music by earing the band Stalk, with his brother Damon (on organ and piano) and his sister Danae (on vocals), playing in the basement beneath his room. 
He began piano lessons at the age of eight. By age eleven, he began his career with the Long Island's local heavy metal bands: Phoenix. 
At 16 years old, David DeFeis met for the first time his future partner Edward Pursino when David's band at the time, called Mountain Ash, was auditioning for a gig at the high school dance. Mountain Ash was mainly a Black Sabbath cover band and, after the performance of the song "War Pigs", Pursino came over and introduced himself to DeFeis.
At the beginning of the 1980s, together with Jack Starr and Joey Ayvazian, David DeFeis started the first line-up of the band Virgin Steele. They debuted in 1982 with the song "Children of the Storm" included in the compilation "U.S. Metal Vol. II". 
In 1985, the guitarist Edward Pursino replaced Starr. Among the years, in their longtime repationship in Virgin Steele, DeFeis and Pursino released a lot of heavy metal classics such as the albums: "Noble Savage", "Invictus", "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Part I", "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Part II".
David DeFeis collects swords: his collection includes more than 20 items. In studio, sometimes he uses his swords to create particular effects for the Virgin Steele songs, and during the concerts he usually burns a sword on stage.
Metal opera & theatre.
Between the end of the 1990s and the 2000s (decade), David DeFeis wrote music for actors based on the Oresteia and the Greek myths related by Aeschylus. According with German artists Walter Weyers and Martina Krawulsky, with the name "Klytaimnestra": "The House of Atreus" Metal Opera (musically available on the Virgin Steele's albums "The House of Atreus Act I", "The House of Atreus Act II") was performed on stage in Germany theaters by Landestheater Production. 
The premiere of "Klytaimnestra" in Memmingen, June 5, 1999, has been the first ever regular musical theatre show based on heavy metal concepts. 
After "Klytaimnestra" success, David DeFeis & Landestheater Production extracted a second Metal Opera musical, named "The Rebels", from the previous Virgin Steele's albums of the Marriage of Heaven and Hell trilogy ("The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Part I", "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Part II", "Invictus").
In 2003, the same team released a third Metal Opera, named "Lilith", based on the material of album "Visions of Eden". "Visons of Eden" was later on published in CD in 2006. In a different way to the previous two Operas, David DeFeis declared: ""I don't think of it as a Metal Opera. What it really is, is the soundtrack for a major motion picture that has yet to be made! And by the hammer of Zeus, I will make this film one day. I call this work a Barbaric Romantic movie of the mind."".
Producer.
David DeFeis owns his personal recording studio called: "The Hammer of Zeus" (sometimes also called "The Wrecking Ball Of Thor"). 
Virgin Steele's albums are produced by David DeFeis himself. 
He also produced albums released by other artists such as: "Out of the Darkness" and "No Turning Back" by Jack Starr, "Nightmare Theatre" by Exorcist, "Stay Ugly" by Piledriver, "The Sign of the Jackal" by Damien Thorn, "Sin Will Find You Out" by Original Sin.

Batman and Robin (serial)

Batman and Robin is a 15-chapter serial released in 1949 by Columbia Pictures. Robert Lowery played Batman, while Johnny Duncan played Robin. Supporting players included Jane Adams as Vicki Vale and veteran character actor Lyle Talbot as Commissioner Gordon. 
The serials were re-released as Video On Demand titles, by Rifftrax, the alumni project of Mystery Science Theater 3000's - Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett - as. As of February 2014, they are up to the installment "Batman: Robin Meets The Wizard", and will be releasing the entire serial series.
Plot.
The Dynamic Duo face off against the Wizard, a hooded villain with an electrical device which controls cars and a desire to set challenges for the Dynamic Duo, whose identity remains a mystery throughout until the end.
Production.
"As usual on a Katzman production," note Harmon and Glut, "the low budget showed everywhere in money-saving shortcuts, and inadequacies." The Batman costume had a poorly fitting cowl and the Robin costume added pink tights to cover the "hairy-legs" of both the actor and stuntman. The Batmobile is again excluded, but instead of a limousine, as in the first serial, the duo drive around in a 1949 Mercury.
Several mistakes and failures of logic occur in the serial. One example of this is that the film shows the Bat-Signal working in broad daylight. Another occurs when, despite the fact that the heroes' utility belts had been replaced by normal belts with no pockets or pouches for this serial, in order to escape from a vault, Batman pulls the nozzle and hose of an oxy-acetylene torch from his belt to cut through a steel door (the tanks for the torch are not shown); to compound this mistake, it is a full-sized oxy-acetylene torch that would have been impossible to carry unseen on his person. Harmon and Glut suggest that this was probably scripted to be a miniaturised 3-inch torch, as used in the comics, but the film-makers improvised in following the directions for a "blowtorch".

Astronomica is the fourth and final album by the American progressive metal band Crimson Glory, released in 1999 via Spitfire Records (USA) and Rising Sun (Europe). After a long hiatus following their less-than-successful album Strange and Beautiful, the band reformed with Wade Black on vocals and Steve Wacholz (of Savatage fame) on drums. Although he is pictured in the album artwork (with the intention of being the new drummer), Wacholz never actually played on the record - a drum machine was used. Wade Black's vocal delivery was not appreciated by all fans, who were accustomed to Midnight's voice. Still, the album was greeted as a successful comeback.

Montefiore Synagogue

The Montefiore Synagogue is the former private synagogue of Sir Moses Montefiore. It is an 1833, Grade II* listed building in Ramsgate, Kent, England.
History.
The synagogue was in the European tradition of great men having private chapels on their estates. Sir Moses Montefiore had the synagogue built immediately upon purchasing the seaside East Cliff estate at Ramsgate and building a country house. On the day the building was dedicated, Montefiore fulfilled the Jewish custom of marking such an occasion by giving charity to the poor by giving money to be distributed by the priests of the two neighbouring Church of England parishes.
The house has been demolished. The synagogue remains in use by the Sephardic community.
In 2007 a general medical practice opened on the grounds of the former estate. The developer contributed funds to preserve the woodlands next to the historic synagogue.
Architecture.
The building is set on a knoll that, in Sir Moses' day, overlooked extensive gardens.
The synagogue is a noted example of ecclesiastical Regency architecture. The architect was Montefiore's cousin, David Mocatta. It was the first purpose-built synagogue in Britain designed by a Jewish architect. It is a masonry building covered with stucco. The building is a rectangular with canted corners and a semicircular apse to accommodate the Torah Ark. The small vestibule contains the stairway of the women's gallery. The facade features a clock, which is unusual in synagogue architecture. It is the only synagogue ever built in the United Kingdom with a chiming clock. The clock bears the motto, "Time flies, virtue alone remains." The Montefiore coat of arms was a later addition to the facade.
The typically Regency interior features an octagonal dome with a lantern to admit daylight, and a window over the Torah Ark. The interior was originally of whitewashed plaster. The pink, grey and cream marble and granite walls and much of the furniture were added by Montefiore's heirs in 1912. Oak furniture and iron gallery supports were added in 1933. Windows on the northeast and southeast walls with stained glass were also added in 1933.
The synagogue is illuminated by candles in the original chandeliers. The gallery is curtained by an old-fashioned, tall, latticework. It retains Lady Montefiore's original seat, no. 3. Sir Moses' seat is on the ground floor. The original wooden board with the prayer for the Royal Family is now in the Bristol Synagogue.
Mausoleum.
Next to the synagogue is the tomb which is the final resting place of Sir Moses and Judith, Lady Montefiore. It is a replica of Rachel's Tomb on the road from Jerusalem to Bethlehem. During an 1841 visit to the Levant, Montefiore got permission from the Ottoman Empire to restore the tomb.
Like Rachel's tomb, the Montefiore mausoleum is cube surmounted by a dome. It has an open, arched porch. The interior has a stained glass skylight but no other decoration. The two graves are marked by identical chest tombs of Aberdeen marble. The graves face east, towards Jerusalem. The floor is made of Minton tile. The porch features ironwork grills in intricate Moorish patterns. 
Beyond the tomb there is a short, stone pillar of Galilee basalt on a plinth, which the Montefiores brought from the Levant.

<doc id="19360650" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19360650" title="Mario Einaudi">
Mario Einaudi

Mario Einaudi was a scholar of political theory and European comparative politics. He was born in 1904 in Italy in one of the most influential intellectual family in Italy. His father, Luigi Einaudi, was one of Italy’s great economic thinkers and later became the second President of the Republic of Italy (1948-55). His brother, Giulio Einaudi, was antifascist and the founder of the leading intellectual publishing house Giulio Einaudi Editore. A graduate of the University of Turin’s distinguished law faculty, Mario Einaudi married Manon Michels, the daughter of the socialist Robert Michels, in 1933. 
Career.
After graduation from Turin with a dissertation on Edmund Burke, Einaudi went to Berlin, where he met German jurists Fredrich Meinecke and Carl Schmitt. He then spent two years at the London School of Economics working with William Beveridge, Harold Laski, Graham Wallas and A. D. Lindsay. While in London, he also met exiles from Fascism, Don Luigi Sturzo and Gaetano Salvemini, both of whom had formed political parties after World War I, only to be brushed aside by Mussolini. 
From 1927 – 1929, Einaudi attended Harvard University as a Rockefeller fellow, conducting research on the United States Supreme Court. Later, he was fired from the faculty at the University of Messina for refusing to sign the Fascist oath; however, Harvard University gave him refuge, first as a tutor and then as an instructor. 
In 1938, Einaudi was appointed as Assistant Professor at Fordham University where he was active in the struggle against fascism during World War II. He worked for the Office of War Information and the Council on Foreign Relations and began to teach future Allied Military Government personnel about European government once a week at Cornell University. It is said that he prepared his lectures on the now defunct Lehigh Valley railroad, during his commute between New York City and Ithaca, NY. 
Cornell University.
Einaudi joined the Government Department of Cornell University in 1945 and immediately set about changing the course of comparative political theory. Eventually, Einaudi became the Goldwin Smith Professor, chair of the Department of Government from 1951 to 1956 and again from 1959 to 1963, presiding over an expansion of the Department from 5 to 12 members. Three central tenets to Einaudi’s work were: that the study of politics must be embedded in history; that Europe and the United States have much to teach each other about the practice of democratic politics; and that the classics of political theory must inform the study of contemporary democratic states. These themes were best embodied in his 1959 book, The Roosevelt Revolution. 
In 1960, Einaudi was asked to be the founding director of the Center for International Studies to initiate Cornell University’s newfound commitment to engage in interdisciplinary research in international affairs. He envisioned international studies going beyond courses in area studies and foreign languages to include academic efforts to deal with economic, social, and development problems around the world. His foresight and leadership resulted in a design for the Center that insured its viability and growth into the future. Starting with a $3.25 million grant from the Ford Foundation in 1962, he raised more than $11 million to fund and endow international studies at Cornell during his leadership of the Center from 1960-1962, 1966-1968. 
Fondazione Luigi Einaudi.
In 1964, he founded the Fondazione Luigi Einaudi in Turin, Italy in honor of his father. As Italian universities entered the turbulent 1960s, Einaudi recognized that European scholars were without necessary relief from teaching and administration needed to devote themselves to research. Hence, the Fondazione Luigi Einaudi was formed to transplant the American idea of the independent research institute to Italy. Today, it houses one of the world’s most important economic history collections and gives postgraduate fellowships for students from around the world. 
Retirement.
Although Einaudi retired in 1972, he remained active in Cornell's Center for International Studies, advising students, supporting its many activities, and inspiring the founding and expansion of the Institute for European Studies. With the help of the Italian Government, Einaudi also raised the funds for the Luigi Einaudi Chair in European and International Studies at Cornell. Since 1987, the Chair brings distinguished European scholars working in fields related to Luigi Einaudi’s interest to the Cornell campus on a rotating basis. 
In 1991, the Cornell’s Center for International Studies was renamed the Mario Einaudi Center for International Studies. Cornell’s Board of Trustees honored him for his long dedication to the University and as a “tireless proponent of clear and critical thinking, democracy, and ethics in politics; and a firm believer in the power of human values to transform the world.” 
Mario Einaudi died in 1994 in Piedmont, Italy.

Bank

A bank is a financial institution and a financial intermediary that accepts deposits and channels those deposits into lending activities, either directly by loaning or indirectly through capital markets. A bank links together customers that have capital deficits and customers with capital surpluses.
Due to their influential status within the financial system and upon national economies, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalised a system known as fractional reserve banking, in which banks hold only a small reserve of the funds deposited and lend out the rest for profit. They are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.
Banking in its modern sense evolved in the 14th century in the rich cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had its roots in the ancient world. In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties have played a central role over many centuries. The oldest existing bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, was founded in 1472 in Siena, Italy.
History.
The origins of modern banking can be traced to medieval and early Renaissance Italy, to the rich cities in the north like Florence, Lucca, Siena, Venice and Genoa. The Bardi and Peruzzi families dominated banking in 14th century Florence, establishing branches in many other parts of Europe. One of the most famous Italian banks was the Medici Bank, set up by Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici in 1397. The earliest known state deposit bank, Banco di San Giorgio (Bank of St. George), was founded in 1407 at Genoa, Italy.
Modern banking practice, including fractional reserve banking and the issue of banknotes emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries. Merchants started to store their gold with the goldsmiths of London, who possessed private vaults, and charged a fee for that service. In exchange for each deposit of precious metal, the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee; these receipts could not be assigned, only the original depositor could collect the stored goods.
Gradually the goldsmiths began to lend the money out on behalf of the depositor, which led to the development of modern banking practices; promissory notes (which evolved into banknotes) were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith. The goldsmith paid interest on these deposits. Since the promissory notes were payable on demand, and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of fractional reserve banking. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay, allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of default. Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit. 
The Bank of England was the first to begin the permanent issue of banknotes, in 1695. The Royal Bank of Scotland established the first overdraft facility in 1728. By the beginning of the 19th century a bankers' clearing house was established in London to allow multiple banks to clear transactions. The Rothschild's pioneered international finance on a large scale, financing the purchase of the Suez canal for the British government.
The oldest bank still in existence is Monte dei Paschi di Siena, headquartered in Siena, Italy, which has been operating continuously since 1472. It is followed by Berenberg Bank of Hamburg (1590) and Sveriges Riksbank of Sweden (1668).
Origin of the word.
The word " bank" was borrowed in Middle English from Middle French "banque", from Old Italian "banca", from Old High German "banc, bank" "bench, counter". Benches were used as desks or exchange counters during the Renaissance by Florentine bankers, who used to make their transactions atop desks covered by green tablecloths.
One of the oldest items found showing money-changing activity is a silver Greek drachm coin from ancient Hellenic colony Trapezus on the Black Sea, modern Trabzon, c. 350–325 BC, presented in the British Museum in London. The coin shows a banker's table ("trapeza") laden with coins, a pun on the name of the city. In fact, even today in Modern Greek the word Trapeza ("Τράπεζα") means both a table (in formal language) and a bank (in everyday speech. everyday word used for "table" is trapezi ("τραπέζι"), a modern form of the archaic trapeza ("τράπεζα"). 
Definition.
The definition of a bank varies from country to country. See the relevant country page (below) for more information.
Under English common law, a banker is defined as a person who carries on the business of banking, which is specified as:
In most common law jurisdictions there is a Bills of Exchange Act that codifies the law in relation to negotiable instruments, including cheques, and this Act contains a statutory definition of the term "banker": "banker" includes a body of persons, whether incorporated or not, who carry on the business of banking' (Section 2, Interpretation). Although this definition seems circular, it is actually functional, because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is structured or regulated.
The business of banking is in many English common law countries not defined by statute but by common law, the definition above. In other English common law jurisdictions there are statutory definitions of the "business of banking" or "banking business". When looking at these definitions it is important to keep in mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the legislation, and not necessarily in general. In particular, most of the definitions are from legislation that has the purposes of entry regulating and supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking. However, in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law one. Examples of statutory definitions:
Since the advent of EFTPOS (Electronic Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale), direct credit, direct debit and internet banking, the cheque has lost its primacy in most banking systems as a payment instrument. This has led legal theorists to suggest that the cheque based definition should be broadened to include financial institutions that conduct current accounts for customers and enable customers to pay and be paid by third parties, even if they do not pay and collect checks.
Banking.
Standard activities.
Banks act as payment agents by conducting checking or current accounts for customers, paying cheques drawn by customers on the bank, and collecting cheques deposited to customers' current accounts. Banks also enable customer payments via other payment methods such as Automated Clearing House (ACH), Wire transfers or telegraphic transfer, EFTPOS, and automated teller machine (ATM).
Banks borrow money by accepting funds deposited on current accounts, by accepting term deposits, and by issuing debt securities such as banknotes and bonds. Banks lend money by making advances to customers on current accounts, by making installment loans, and by investing in marketable debt securities and other forms of money lending.
Banks provide different payment services, and a bank account is considered indispensable by most businesses and individuals. Non-banks that provide payment services such as remittance companies are normally not considered as an adequate substitute for a bank account.
Banks can create new money when they make a loan. New loans throughout the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system. The money supply is usually increased by the act of lending, and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated. In the United Kingdom between 1997 and 2007, there was a big increase in the money supply, largely caused by much more bank lending, which served to push up property prices and increase private debt. The amount of money in the economy as measured by M4 in the UK went from £750 billion to £1700 billion between 1997 and 2007, much of the increase caused by bank lending. If all the banks increase their lending together, then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase. Excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default, the banks then become more cautious, so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened in the UK and many other Western economies after 2007.
Channels.
Banks offer many different channels to access their banking and other services:
Business model.
A bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest, transaction fees and financial advice. The main method is via charging interest on the capital it lends out to customers. The bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds, and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities.
This difference is referred to as the spread between the cost of funds and the loan interest rate. Historically, profitability from lending activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and the stage of the economic cycle. Fees and financial advice constitute a more stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these revenue lines to smooth their financial performance.
In the past 20 years American banks have taken many measures to ensure that they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market conditions.
This helps in making profit and facilitates economic development as a whole.
Risk and capital.
Banks face a number of risks in order to conduct their business, and how well these risks are managed and understood is a key driver behind profitability, and how much capital a bank is required to hold. Some of the main risks faced by banks include:
The capital requirement is a bank regulation, which sets a framework on how banks and depository institutions must handle their capital. The categorization of assets and capital is highly standardized so that it can be risk weighted (see risk-weighted asset).
Banks in the economy.
Economic functions.
The economic functions of banks include:
Bank crisis.
Banks are susceptible to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises. These include liquidity risk (where many depositors may request withdrawals in excess of available funds), credit risk (the chance that those who owe money to the bank will not repay it), and interest rate risk (the possibility that the bank will become unprofitable, if rising interest rates force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans).
Banking crises have developed many times throughout history, when one or more risks have emerged for a banking sector as a whole. Prominent examples include the bank run that occurred during the Great Depression, the U.S. Savings and Loan crisis in the 1980s and early 1990s, the Japanese banking crisis during the 1990s, and the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the 2000s.
Size of global banking industry.
Assets of the largest 1,000 banks in the world grew by 6.8% in the 2008/2009 financial year to a record US$96.4 trillion while profits declined by 85% to US$115 billion. Growth in assets in adverse market conditions was largely a result of recapitalization. EU banks held the largest share of the total, 56% in 2008/2009, down from 61% in the previous year. Asian banks' share increased from 12% to 14% during the year, while the share of US banks increased from 11% to 13%. Fee revenue generated by global investment banking totaled US$66.3 billion in 2009, up 12% on the previous year.
The United States has the most banks in the world in terms of institutions (7,085 at the end of 2008) and possibly branches (82,000). This is an indicator of the geography and regulatory structure of the USA, resulting in a large number of small to medium-sized institutions in its banking system. As of Nov 2009, China's top 4 banks have in excess of 67,000 branches (ICBC:18000+, BOC:12000+, CCB:13000+, ABC:24000+) with an additional 140 smaller banks with an undetermined number of branches.
Japan had 129 banks and 12,000 branches. In 2004, Germany, France, and Italy each had more than 30,000 branches—more than double the 15,000 branches in the UK.
Regulation.
"Currently commercial banks are regulated in most jurisdictions by government entities and require a special bank license to operate."
Usually the definition of the business of banking for the purposes of regulation is extended to include acceptance of deposits, even if they are not repayable to the customer's order—although money lending, by itself, is generally not included in the definition.
Unlike most other regulated industries, the regulator is typically also a participant in the market, being either a publicly or privately governed central bank. Central banks also typically have a monopoly on the business of issuing banknotes. However, in some countries this is not the case. In the UK, for example, the Financial Services Authority licenses banks, and some commercial banks (such as the Bank of Scotland) issue their own banknotes in addition to those issued by the Bank of England, the UK government's central bank.
Banking law is based on a contractual analysis of the relationship between the "bank" (defined above) and the "customer"—defined as any entity for which the bank agrees to conduct an account.
The law implies rights and obligations into this relationship as follows:
These implied contractual terms may be modified by express agreement between the customer and the bank. The statutes and regulations in force within a particular jurisdiction may also modify the above terms and/or create new rights, obligations or limitations relevant to the bank-customer relationship.
Some types of financial institution, such as building societies and credit unions, may be partly or wholly exempt from bank license requirements, and therefore regulated under separate rules.
The requirements for the issue of a bank license vary between jurisdictions but typically include:
Types of banks.
Banks' activities can be divided into:
Most banks are profit-making, private enterprises. However, some are owned by government, or are non-profit organizations.
Challenges within the banking industry.
United States.
The United States banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated in the world, with multiple specialized and focused regulators. All banks with FDIC-insured deposits have the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as a regulator. However, for soundness examinations (i.e., whether a bank is operating in a sound manner), the Federal Reserve is the primary federal regulator for Fed-member state banks; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is the primary federal regulator for national banks; and the Office of Thrift Supervision, or OTS, is the primary federal regulator for thrifts. State non-member banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the FDIC. National banks have one primary regulator—the OCC. Qualified Intermediaries & Exchange Accommodators are regulated by MAIC.
Each regulatory agency has their own set of rules and regulations to which banks and thrifts must adhere.
The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) was established in 1979 as a formal inter-agency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions. Although the FFIEC has resulted in a greater degree of regulatory consistency between the agencies, the rules and regulations are constantly changing.
In addition to changing regulations, changes in the industry have led to consolidations within the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OTS, MAIC and OCC. Offices have been closed, supervisory regions have been merged, staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut. The remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator. While banks struggle to keep up with the changes in the regulatory environment, regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks. The impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less hands-on assessment by the regulators, less time spent with each institution, and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks, potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the United States.
The changing economic environment has a significant impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans, rate competition for deposits and the general market changes, industry trends and economic fluctuations. It has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market. A rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions, but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders.
The management of the banks’ asset portfolios also remains a challenge in today’s economic environment. Loans are a bank’s primary asset category and when loan quality becomes suspect, the foundation of a bank is shaken to the core. While always an issue for banks, declining asset quality has become a big problem for financial institutions. There are several reasons for this, one of which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of “good times.” The potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management. Problems are more likely to go undetected, resulting in a significant impact on the bank when they are discovered. In addition, banks, like any business, struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses, such as adequate employee training programs.
Banks also face a host of other challenges such as aging ownership groups. Across the country, many banks’ management teams and board of directors are aging. Banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders, both public and private, to achieve earnings and growth projections. Regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk. Banking is also an extremely competitive industry. Competing in the financial services industry has become tougher with the entrance of such players as insurance agencies, credit unions, check cashing services, credit card companies, etc.
As a reaction, banks have developed their activities in financial instruments, through financial market operations such as brokerage and MAIC trust & Securities Clearing services trading and become big players in such activities.
Competition for loanable funds.
To be able to provide home buyers and builders with the funds needed, banks must compete for deposits. The phenomenon of disintermediation had to dollars moving from savings accounts and into direct market instruments such as U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, agency securities, and corporate debt. One of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the tremendous growth of money market funds whose higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits.
To compete for deposits, US savings institutions offer many different types of plans:
Accounting for bank accounts.
Bank statements are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting standards of the world. Under GAAP and MAIC there are two kinds of accounts: debit and credit. Credit accounts are Revenue, Equity and Liabilities. Debit Accounts are Assets and Expenses. This means you credit a "credit account" to increase its balance, and you debit a "credit account" to decrease its balance.
This also means you credit your savings account every time you deposit money into it (and the account is normally in credit), while you debit your credit card account every time you spend money from it (and the account is normally in debit).
However, if you read your bank statement, it will say the opposite—that you credit your account when you deposit money, and you debit it when you withdraw funds. If you have cash in your account, you have a positive (or credit) balance; if you are overdrawn, you have a negative (or deficit) balance.
Where bank transactions, balances, credits and debits are discussed below, they are done so from the viewpoint of the account holder—which is traditionally what most people are used to seeing.
Brokered deposits.
One source of deposits for banks is brokers who deposit large sums of money on the behalf of investors through MAIC or other trust corporations. This money will generally go to the banks which offer the most favorable terms, often better than those offered local depositors. It is possible for a bank to engage in business with no local deposits at all, all funds being brokered deposits. Accepting a significant quantity of such deposits, or "hot money" as it is sometimes called, puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position, as the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to pay the high interest being paid on the brokered deposits. This may result in risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank. Banks which failed during 2008 and 2009 in the United States during the global financial crisis had, on average, four times more brokered deposits as a percent of their deposits than the average bank. Such deposits, combined with risky real estate investments, factored into the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. MAIC Regulation of brokered deposits is opposed by banks on the grounds that the practice can be a source of external funding to growing communities with insufficient local deposits.
Globalization in the Banking Industry.
In modern time there has been huge reductions to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry. Increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies, such as Bloomberg, have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world, since they no longer have to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk. The growth in cross-border activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities. 
However, despite these reductions in barriers and growth in cross-border activities, the banking industry is nowhere near as globalized as some other industries. In the USA, for instance, very few banks even worry about the Riegle-Neal Act, which promotes more efficient interstate banking. In the vast majority of nations around globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation. 
One reason the banking industry has not been fully globalized is that it is more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small business and individuals. On the other hand for large corporations, it is not as important in what nation the bank is in, since the corporation's financial information is available around the globe.

1998 FA Charity Shield

The 1998 FA Charity Shield was the 76th FA Charity Shield, an annual English football match played between the winners of the previous season's Premier League and FA Cup competitions. It was contested by Arsenal, who won a league and FA Cup double the previous season, and Manchester United, who finished runners-up in the league on 9 August 1998. Watched by a crowd of 67,342 at Wembley Stadium, Arsenal won the match 3–0.
This was Arsenal's 14th Charity Shield appearance and Manchester United's 18th. The match saw United captain Roy Keane start his first competitive game, since damaging his cruciate ligaments 11 months earlier and defender Jaap Stam making his competitive debut for the club. For Arsenal, striker Dennis Bergkamp partnered Nicolas Anelka in the first team, and recently acquired defender Nelson Vivas was named on the substitutes' bench.
Manchester United began the game the better of the two, but conceded 11 minutes before half time through Marc Overmars. Arsenal extended their lead in the second half – good play from Overmars and Anelka found Christopher Wreh to put the ball into an empty net at the second time of asking. In the 72nd minute, Arsenal scored a third goal, when Anelka evaded Stam in the penalty box to shoot past goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.
Arsenal's win marked the first time a southern club had won the Shield outright in 36 years. By contrast, it was Manchester United's first Shield defeat in seven matches. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger described the scoreline as "unexpected" and felt the result was a psychological boost for the coming season, whereas Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson admitted his team were beaten by the better side on the day.
Background.
The FA Charity Shield was founded in 1908, initially contested between the top professional and amateur teams of each season. In 1921, it was played between the Football League champions and FA Cup winners for the first time; the formation of a new top-tier division, the Premier League in 1992, meant it displaced the Football League spot. Wembley Stadium acted as the host of the Shield.
Arsenal qualified for the 1998 FA Charity Shield as winners of the 1997–98 FA Premier League. Although the team were 12 points behind league leaders Manchester United by the end of February 1998, a winning streak of nine matches ensured Arsenal won the title, culminating with a 4–0 win over Everton on 3 May 1998. Arsenal beat Newcastle United 2–0 in the 1998 FA Cup Final to complete the domestic double. Given they won both honours, the Charity Shield place went to league runners-up Manchester United.
The last meeting between both teams was in the Premier League; a second-half goal scored by Marc Overmars gave Arsenal a 1–0 win at Old Trafford on 14 March 1998. Arsenal were the only team in the league to have beaten United home and away in 1997–98, with the corresponding fixture, at home, ending 3–2 in their favour. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger acknowledged the Shield game was the "only opportunity to play our first-team men together against top-class opposition" before their league campaign commenced the following week. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was preoccupied with the club's UEFA Champions League two-legged tie against ŁKS Łódź, with the first game in midweek. He nevertheless relished the match, as it would get "players' sharpness up and provide plenty of benefit for the two important games to come in the next six days".
Match.
Team selection.
Manchester United winger Jesper Blomqvist was ruled out of the match with an ankle injury, but Roy Keane was declared fit to start his first competitive match since damaging his ligaments against Leeds United in September 1997. Defender Jaap Stam, who signed for United in May 1998 made his competitive debut for the club, partnering centre back Ronny Johnsen. For Arsenal, new signing Nelson Vivas began the match on the substitutes bench, in spite of being expected to make his full debut. Dennis Bergkamp partnered Nicolas Anelka upfront.
Summary.
Manchester United began brightly in front of a crowd of 67,342, with their midfield coping well against Arsenal's pair Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit, who both took longer to get into the match, having partaked in France's successful World Cup campaign. United fashioned their first chance through David Beckham, who throughout the match was subjected to "moronic booing" – many fans blamed him for England's elimination from the 1998 World Cup. His crossfield pass met Ryan Giggs, who failed to control the ball, but clipped into Paul Scholes, whose attempt forced David Seaman to clear. In spite of United's promising start, it was Arsenal who scored the opening goal. Vieira chipped the ball over the United defence, which met Bergkamp. The striker ran and backheeled the ball to Anelka, who then blocked Johnsen's attempt to clear. The ball broke to Overmars – from inside the penalty area, he flicked the ball first time past Schmeichel. A shot by Keane from "25 yards" prompted a save from Seaman, three minutes before the break.
Arsenal "regained control" in the second half, with right-sided players Lee Dixon and Ray Parlour threatening to score. In the 57th minute, Arsenal increased their lead. From the left wing, Overmars used his pace to get the better of Gary Neville and passed the ball to Anelka, which drew in Stam. Anelka in turn transferred it to Wreh, whose shot was saved once by Schmeichel, but not on the rebound. In spite of the setback, United continued to pressure Arsenal; defender Martin Keown nearly turned the ball into his own net from Giggs' corner that was flicked on by Johnsen. Both clubs made mass substitutions in the final third of the game, notably Teddy Sheringham and Luís Boa Morte coming on for Andy Cole – who "hardly mustered a shot" and Petit respectively. Sheringham wasted United's best chance to score before Arsenal scored a third – Parlour's pass found Anelka, who evaded Stam and shot left-footed past Schmeichel, at the goalkeeper's near post.

Post-match.
The result was the first time a southern club had won the Shield outright since Tottenham Hotspur in 1962 and was Manchester United's first defeat in seven Shield matches. Wenger described the scoreline as "unexpected" and cited the first goal as "crucial" in the match, given the weather conditions. He was content with how his international players, who had been in the World Cup "coped physically" and believed the result gave Arsenal a psychological boost for the Champions League campaign, as the club planned to stage their home matches at Wembley Stadium. Bergkamp felt the result showed that Arsenal had what it takes to retain the Premier League title: "We've still got the same mentality and that will be the basis for this year's challenge. This is a good start. It is harder to retain the trophy."
Ferguson admitted his team were been beaten by the better side and concurred with Wenger that the first goal was important. He was pleased that captain Roy Keane "came through" the match after eleven months out of action and was confident his team would fare better in their next match, against ŁKS Łódź the following Wednesday. Schmeichel felt the upcoming qualifier was more important than the Charity Shield game, which was "looked at as part of our pre-season build-up." Ferguson anticipated another title challenge from Arsenal in the league: "I think you could make a strong case for four teams to challenge for the Premiership but I think Arsenal pose the biggest threat."
Three days after the Charity Shield match, United beat ŁKS Łódź by two goals to nil and qualified for the Champions League group stages following a goalless match a fortnight later. Both clubs later faced each other in the league, with Arsenal winning 3–0 at Highbury in September 1998, before a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford six months after. They were also paired together in the FA Cup semi-final, which was settled in a replay following a goalless affair. Manchester United won in extra time – the winning goal scored by Giggs. The two teams went into the final day of the 1998–99 FA Premier League with a chance of winning the title; United's 2–1 win against Tottenham meant they pipped Arsenal to first position by a point. Whereas Arsenal failed to progress past the group stages of the Champions League, Manchester United eventually went on to win the competition, beating Bayern Munich in the final. Ferguson's team therefore completed a treble of trophies in one season.

838th Air Division

The 838th Air Division (838 AD) is an inactive United States Air Force organization. Its last assignment was with Tactical Air Command, assigned to Twelfth Air Force, being stationed at Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas. It was inactivated on December 24, 1969.
The unit was an intermediate command echelon of Tactical Air Command. Activated but not manned or equipped in 1957, but reactivated in 1963. The 838 AD provided command and staff supervision for subordinate units, which performed worldwide tactical airlift and participated in tactical exercises and operations such as Desert Strike. Between 1964 and 1969, the units frequently deployed aircraft and personnel to Europe, the Far East, and the Canal Zone with its subordinate units performing tactical airlift missions.
The command was inactivated in 1969 as a result of budget reductions, its units being consolidated directly into Twelfth Air Force.

Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia

Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia (LARA) was created in April 1946 by eleven volunteer relief organizations, it was the Asian equivalent to CRALOG in Europe.
The purpose of the organization was to coordinate efforts in occupied Japan and have a single point of contact with the military authorities (SCAP) which refused to deal with the member organizations, such as the Catholic Church, on a one to one basis. 
LARA was operational 1946-1952 and sent large amounts of food and clothing to Japan, by December 1949 more than 10 million tonnes had been sent.
LARA was initially the only non-governmental relief organization allowed to operate in Japan, although beginning in late 1947 CARE Packages (U.S. Army ten-in-One rations) from CARE were also distributed. In 1949 UNICEF began distributing milk to Japanese schoolchildren, although the cost for this was charged to the Japanese government. 
The member organizations included amongst others:
Roughly 20% of the aid was donated by Nikkei and Japanese nationals.

Spencer Timothy Hall

Spencer Timothy Hall (16 December 1812 – 26 April 1885), was an English writer and mesmerist.
Early life.
He was born in a cottage near Sutton in Ashfield in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire, the son of Samuel Hall, a Quaker cobbler and Eleanor Spencer, a dairymaid. He received some education from his father and at seven years of age entered the weaving trade.
Career.
After reading the life of Benjamin Franklin, Hall resolved to become a printer. In January 1829, he went to Nottingham and was apprenticed at the office of "The Mercury newspaper". He began writing poetry, and by 1832 he was contributing verse to "The Mirror, The Metropolitan Magazine", and other periodicals.
In 1836, Hall returned to Sutton in Ashfield, where he started his own printing and bookselling business and printed a monthly periodical called the "Sherwood Magazine", in which he published his work under the pseudonym "The Sherwood Forester". In May 1839, he joined the printing firm Hargrove at York. In 1841, he published a volume of prose and verse entitled "The Forester's Offering". The book earned Hall an invitation from James Montgomery to Sheffield, where he became co-editor of "The Iris" newspaper and governor of the Hollis Hospital. He wrote a volume of prose sketches entitled "Rambles in the Country for The Iris"; it was reissued in an enlarged form in 1853 as "The Peak and the Plain". As the result of a visit to Ireland in the famine years he published "Life and Death in Ireland as Witnessed in 1849" (1850).
Hall was also interested in popular scientific movements. He was the first honorary secretary of the Sheffield Phrenological Society and later an honorary member of the Phrenological Society of Glasgow. In 1841, he learned about mesmerism from watching some spectacular demonstrations by a Frenchman named Lafontaine, who was touring northern England. Hall then taught himself mesmerism and began to make his own tours of the country, giving public demonstrations, offering tutelage and therapy, and selling copies of a journal he founded in 1843, "The Phreno-Magnet, or, Mirror of Nature". His most illustrious patient was Harriet Martineau, whom, it seems, he cured of an apparently hopeless disease of the uterus. Martineau was first diagnosed in 1839; after over five years of suffering, she was introduced to mesmerism by her brother-in-law, who had been impressed by one of Hall's lectures in Newcastle. "Everything that medical skill and family care could do for me had been tried, without any avail", Martineau wrote in her "Autobiography" (1877); "Now that a new experiment was proposed to me … I had nothing to do but try it".
About 1852, Hall became a homoeopathic doctor and published "Homoeopathy: A Testimony" (1852). He was granted the honorary degrees of MA and PhD from Tübingen.
Personal life.
He was married twice: his first wife, Sarah, died only nine months after their wedding; his second marriage produced several children.
Death.
He died at Blackpool on 26 April 1885, and was buried in Layton Cemetery.

Cornell Engineering Library

The Cornell Engineering Library serves the students, faculty and staff of the Cornell University College of Engineering, as well as the larger university and scholarly community. It serves the 12 schools of the College of Engineering and their approximately 3000 undergraduates, 1300 graduate students, 230 faculty, staff, and the many research centers thereof. Library liaisons are assigned from the library staff to each department. All engineering disciplines, computer science, and the earth and atmospheric sciences at the undergraduate and graduate level are included. The library, built in 1957, occupies the ground floor of Carpenter Hall (named after Walter S. Carpenter, Jr.) and two sub-levels of the building, sharing space with the Academic Computing Center (ACCEL).
History.
The library is a component of the Cornell University Library. It was started with an endowment by Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., who was associated with E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company from 1909 until his retirement as their chairman of the Board in 1962. Carpenter was a member of the Cornell mechanical engineering class of 1910 and also served Cornell as a member of its board of trustees. Since the late 1800s there were smaller holdings for civil engineering in Lincoln hall and for electrical engineering in Franklin Hall; mechanical engineering materials were kept in the offices of department chairs. 
Collections.
The library physical collection consists of approximately 300,000 print volumes with another 100,000 volumes and 2 million technical reports held off-site at the Library Annex. The Engineering Library's collections are tailored to research currently underway at Cornell and are described in the Engineering Library collection development policy.
Convert to virtual library.
In 2011, the library transitioned into a virtual library. High use print volumes were moved to other libraries on the Cornell campus: 20,000 volumes and course reserves were moved to Uris Library, and other low use items were moved to the Library Annex. The decision to become a virtual library was based on advice from an advisory committee composed of four faculty, three librarians, two graduate students, and two undergraduate students, to re-envision the library. As a result of going virtual, the library has pooled resources into enhancing electronic collections such as e-journals, e-books, society databases and other virtual services. The study space in Carpenter Hall remains open for study space, with librarians on site for reference consultation.

Early years.
Theodore Larsen was born the middle child of five children to Robert and Karen Larsen. In 1972-1976 Robert Larsen played defensive end at Wichita State in Wichita, KS. As a young kid, Ted played baseball, basketball and soccer. It wasn’t until high school that Larsen played football.

That year he not only participated and excelled in football but also did shot put and discus on the PHUHS track and field team. As a senior, he recorded 65 tackles and eight sacks, as well as a blocked kick, earning first-team all-county and District Player of the Year honors. That same year he was named the district Player of the Year by The Florida Athletic Coaches Association. Not only was he a powerhouse on the field but also graduated Palm Harbor University High School with 3.8 GPA and a member of the National Honor Society.
College career.
In 2005, following high school, Larsen attended North Carolina State University. He redshirted his freshman season in 2005, working on the scout team as a defensive tackle. In 2006, Larsen played in 11 games at defensive tackle, starting two games and recording nine tackles and three sacks. In 2007, he played in 14 games as a reserve defensive tackle, recording 12 tackles and two sacks.

In his 2009 senior season, Larsen was again named to the Rimington Trophy watch list. He started 12 games at center and allowed only one sack on the season. As center he had 23 tackles, 4 sacks, 5.5 yd TFL, one forced fumble, one pass defense, and 185 knockdowns/key blocks with 19 touchdowns which resulted in eight downfield blocks, in his two years playing that position. In total he started 30 out of 43 games in his time at NC State, 5 as a defensive tackle and 25 as a center. In May 2009, he graduated North Carolina State University with a degree in history.
Professional career.
New England Patriots.
Larsen was drafted by the New England Patriots in the sixth round (205th overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft. On May 18, he signed a four-year contract with the Patriots. He was described in his pick analysis as follows:
Upon being drafted he became the first student in Palm Harbor University High School’s history to be drafted. In the preseason with the Patriots he played guard. But in September 2010, he was waived by the Patriots and was claimed by his hometown team of Tampa Bay, FL the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
On September 5, 2010, Larsen was claimed off waivers by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He started at left guard beginning Game Six, replacing the soon-to-be released Keydrick Vincent.
During the 2011 season, Larsen appeared in all 16 games for the Bucs (Starting 3) while rotating between Guard & Center.
In 2012, he appeared in all 16 games again and started 13 at Center while being part of an Offensive Line that helped rookie RB Doug Martin rush for 1,454 yards and QB Josh Freeman throw for 4,065 yards. Both career high and franchise records.
Since joining the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he plays number 62 and has started 30 games. And his career highlights include his NFL debut in 2010 versus the St. Louis Rams, game 16 of that year versus Seattle where he helped the offense run 439 yards, the season-high for 2010, and earned the offensive line Madden Most Valuable Protectors honors for Week 16. He then started as a center in 2012 against Oakland where he helped the offense gain 515 yards from scrimmage, leading to the second-most total yards in the history of the Bucs. He is on the last year of his contract for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Personal life.
Ted Larsen his described, as having a calm and monotone demeanor yet can be aggressive, and sometimes considered mean on the field. He describes his early life as being the middle of five children, with an older brother and sister and a younger brother and sister when a 15-year age difference between his closest siblings.
Off the field, he enjoys fishing and has said that after football he would like to be a competitive fisherman. It was fishing that led him, on April 27, 2011, to rescue three young kayakers off Honeymoon Island. Larsen was with his girlfriend on his 24-foot boat; fishing in the choppy gulf waters right off the island. It was around 3pm when he heard the Coast Guard signal that the three kayakers were in need of some help. Upon hearing this, he realized he was close to the area and plucked the two kayaks and three kayakers onto his boat and took them to shore. They young men did not know who had saved them but were grateful. Larsen said later "It was good to help them. It just felt it was a good thing to do." 
With his teammates Larsen likes to do help out those in need. Since joining the team he was helped with the Metropolitan Ministries preparing food and spending time with children, volunteered his time with the Buccaneers’ annual Halloween Celebrations, distributed food for Thanksgiving, sang for hospital patients during the holidays, and surprised single mothers with gifts during the Christmas holiday.

Kitigan Zibi, Quebec

Kitigan Zibi (also known as River Desert, and designated as Maniwaki 18 until 1994) is a First Nations Reserve of the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg First Nation, an Algonquin band. It is situated at the confluence of the Désert and Gatineau Rivers, and borders south-west on the Town of Maniwaki in the Outaouais region of Quebec, Canada. Having a total area of , it is the largest Algonquin Nation in Canada, in both area and population.
Present in the reserve are grocery and hardware supermarkets, gas station, elementary and secondary schools with a library accessible to the whole community, gift shops, a community radio station, a day-care, a community hall, a health centre, a police department, a youth centre, a wildlife centre, and an educational and cultural centre.
Toponymy.
"Kitigàn" means "garden" or "cultivated land." Since Algonquins were historically not farmers, it may be that, in this case, this name originated as a reference to a clearing made by the Hudson's Bay Company for the establishment of its post, dependencies, and the adjoining garden.
Geography.
The reserve is bounded by the Eagle River along its west side, by the Desert River on the north side, and the Gatineau River on the east side. Most of its development is along or near Highway 105, while forest still covers much of the reserve.
It is also home to 13 fresh water lakes with areas in excess of or and approximately 29 smaller lakes and streams located throughout the territory.
Fish species found within these waters are walleye, pike, bass, trout, carp, catfish, and fresh water sturgeon. Mammals found within the reserve include beaver, muskrat, fisher, martin, mink, otter, bobcat, lynx, cougar, deer, black bear, wolf, and moose.
History.
The history of the reserve is closely linked to that of the Town of Maniwaki, which developed concurrently.
In the first half of the nineteenth century, Algonquins of the mission at Lake of Two Mountains, under the leadership of Chief Pakinawatik, came to the area of the Désert River. Shortly after in 1832, the Hudson's Bay Company followed them and installed a trading post at the mouth of this river (now within the municipal boundaries of Maniwaki). A decade later, Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate established the mission of Notre-Dame-du-Desert and, from 1849, they demanded of the authorities the demarcation of a township in order to establish a reserve for the Algonquins. Chief Pakinawatik, along with other leaders, journeyed by canoe on three separate occasions to Upper Canada (Toronto) and negotiated the terms for the setting aside of the reserve land. The township limits were drawn in 1850 and given the name of Maniwaki by the Oblates at this time. In Algonquin language, the place was identified as "Kitigànsìpì" or "Kitigàn Zìbì", meaning "Garden River."
Legally established in 1851, the reserve was demarcated in 1853. In the decree implementing it, the reserve was called "Manawaki" and also "River Desert". The name "Kitigan Zibi" came to replace the other two on September 24, 1994, when the band council gave this title to the reserve.
Because of land claim settlements in the late 1990s, small portions of land of the Town of Maniwaki were added to Kitigan Zibi.
Concerned about the disinterest of its youth in their own language, the community has decided to reintroduce the teaching of the Algonquin language in school.
Demographics.
As of September 2012, the registered population of the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg First Nation is 2,988 members, of whom 1,560 live on the Kitigan Zibi reserve, 28 live on another reserve or crown land, and 1400 live off reserve.

Amongst Friends

Amongst Friends is a 1993 film written and directed by Rob Weiss. 
Storyline.
The film portrays the conspicuous consumption and aggressive upward mobility among the mobsters and drug dealers living among the affluent communities in the Five Towns in southwestern Nassau County, New York. Weiss's voiceover introduces the film citing the contrasts in a community where "you got judges living next to gamblers next to rabbis living next to dentists" and "16-year-old kids thinking and acting like they're Flavor Flav." The film tells the story of three boys — Billy (Joseph Lindsey), Trevor (Patrick McGaw) and Andy (Steve Parlavecchio) — who stray from their parents' professional careers to become low-level gangsters and end up involved in drug running and murder.
Background.
The film received considerable attention at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival and opened in New York City in July. Weiss grew up in Baldwin, New York, close to the Five Towns, and lived with his father in Lawrence for a period of time. While emphasizing that the characters in the film are fictional, Weiss acknowledged that "I'm going to try to hide during the Five Towns screening."
Production.
The film was produced for $900,000, most of which was raised from friends and family, and was shot on location in the Five Towns. With finances tight, a scene in which Weiss opens a bag of Doritos was filmed using yellow cardboard triangles. 
The film was distributed by Fine Line Features, a division of New Line Cinema.
Mira Sorvino was hired to work on the film in pre-production as third assistant director, then was promoted to casting director, then to assistant producer, and was finally offered a lead role. Positive reviews received for her role in the film helped jump start her career. Her grandfather, Ford Sorvino, appears in the film, providing comic relief.
Reviews.
Peter Travers in "Rolling Stone" gave the film three stars, stating that Weiss made "a sensational debut as writer and director", despite the lack of stars or a big budget in a film written with the "pitch-perfect eloquence about the mean streets he knows."
Soundtrack.
A soundtrack containing hip hop and alternative rock was released on August 31, 1993 by Atlantic Records.

Ehretia rigida

Ehretia rigida (Puzzle bush, also Afrikaans: Deurmekaarbos = "confused/tangled bush"), is a small, multi-stemmed tree with a tangled growth habit belonging to the Boraginaceae or borage family. It occurs over a wide range of habitat throughout the eastern part of South Africa, and in Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.
The species is deciduous, hardy and normally grows to about 5m tall. Branches are quite rigid, hence its specific name. Leaves are in tufts, leathery and rough with adpressed minute barbs along the margins. Almost invariably there are small pockets of hairs or acarodomatia, providing a refuge for mites in the axils of veins on the underside of the leaves. Bark is smooth and uniformly ash-grey, becoming rough on older stems. Fragrant lilac-coloured to white flowers are produced in early spring and are followed by small 8mm diameter fruits bearing a persistent style, green at first, turning orange, red and finally black. 
The genus honours the botanist Georg Dionysius Ehret, a celebrated botanist and botanical illustrator of the 18th century.

<doc id="19360804" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19360804" title="Baba Marta Day">
Baba Marta Day

Grandma March Day (or simply "Baba Marta", ) is a holiday celebrated in Bulgaria, on the first of March. Martenitsa - usually in the form of a wrist band, woven by combining red and white colored threads - are worn on that day and through March, until a stork or a bloomed tree is seen, symbolizing warmer weather and well being. Older Bulgarians call it Birch Month, because it is around this time when birch trees start growing leaves and give sap. There's much folklore about Grandma March Day and the character of Baba Marta herself. The greeting exchanged on this day is "Chestita Baba Marta" ("Честита Баба Марта – Happy Baba Marta", often shortened to "ЧБМ" on greetings cards).
There are various theories and suggestions (even several legends, involving real historical figures) about the symbolism of these two particular colors - red & white, from which Martenitsa are made. An obvious explanation and perhaps a common belief people share, is that "red" stands for "life/birth" and "white" denotes "anew/on clear grounds". Combined together, they mean "newborn", "rebirth", "a new beginning"; a celebration of Life and Survival. Another popular explanation is that white stands for wisdom and red for good health, which means that anyone giving you a Martenitsa is wishing you both throughout the new year.
In March, these amulets, worn around one's wrists and on their attire, can be seen almost everywhere in Bulgaria and in the neighboring regions. Being a purely pagan ritual by origin, Baba Marta Day is one of the oldest, still existing traditions in Christian Europe.
Story of Baba Marta.
In folklore, Baba Marta is presented as a sister or a wife of the great long-horned beetle (January) and the small long-horned beetle (February). She is always dissatisfied with them - They are either drunk on wine, or they do other harm . The old woman (bride) becomes angry, hence the weather breaks.
According to a widespread story, an old shepherd gave rise to her flock in the mountains last March days, thinking that Baba Marta will bestow on her a good time because she is as old as her. Baba Marta became angry and asked her brother (April) to borrow her a few days. April granted her wish and these days are called "borrowed days", "zaemnitsi", "few days" in folk tradition. Martha let the strong snows and blizzards that froze the shepherd and her flock in the mountains. Frozen become a pile of rocks that flowed healing..
Festival of Baba Marta.
On holidays she performed ritual acts, which are believed to cause its favor. Participants in her holidays were women, girls and children. It is believed that she likes older women, and they should not under any circumstances cause her anger. Baba Marta is celebrated on March 1, March 9 (Mladenci) and March 25 (Annunciation). The holidays are associated with the spring meeting.

Porsche PFM 3200

The Porsche PFM 3200 was a six-cylinder horizontally opposed air-cooled aircraft engine developed by Porsche from its air-cooled line of automobile engines from the famous Porsche 911 sports car. The PFM designation was derived from the name of the division that designed the engines, "Porsche-Flugmotoren" (~ Porsche Flight Engines).
Design and development.
In the 1950s, European light aircraft builders began adapting the air-cooled automobile engines from the Porsche 356 and Volkswagen Beetle into aircraft engines with a series of limited modifications. Porsche cooperated with some of these builders and produced a series of factory-built engines for about six years between 1957 and 1963, the Porsche 678 series. These relatively small engines displaced about 1.6 litres (97 cubic inches) and produced between 55 and 70 horsepower, depending on the version.
Porsche decided to re-enter the aviation market with much larger engines derived from the engine used in the Porsche 911, starting development in 1981. As the engines ran at higher speed than most aircraft engine designs, the propeller drive used a 0.442:1 reduction gearing so it could drive common propellers. The high operating speed meant the engine ran more smoothly than older designs, and the use of a muffler meant it was quieter as well. With about 3.2 litres (195 cubic inches) displacement, the normally aspirated N-series models produced about 210 hp, while the turbocharged T-series produced about 240 hp. This was roughly twice the horsepower of a conventional lower-rpm design of the same size. With single-lever operation, fully aerobatic fuel and oil supplies, direct fuel injection with automatic altitude compensation and optional turbocharging, the PFM 3200 series were some of the most advanced engines on the market.
After being introduced in late 1985 and starting to generate increasing interest in the general aviation (GA) market, Porsche exited the field during the massive downturn in the market in the late 1980s, closing the lines in 1991. It is suggested that the program cost it US$75 million to develop and produce the small number of engines delivered (about 80). Although marketed for only a short period, the PFM was found on a variety of aircraft as the primary powerplant, or as one-off modifications. These included the Extra 330, Mooney M20L, Socata TB-16, Robin DR400, Ruschmeyer MF-85 and others. Only the M20L went into production, with 40 produced in 1988, and one more in 1989.
In a letter dated September 17, 2007, Porsche informed the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that it was surrendering the type certificate for the PFM 3200 engine and that it would no longer support the engine. In March 2009, the FAA issued a special airworthiness information bulletin stating that type certificates for existing aircraft with the PFM 3200 engine were still valid and would remain so as long as the aircraft meet Federal Aviation Regulations maintenance and operation requirements. However, the bulletin also said that Porsche is not exporting new or replacement parts for the engine and there is no guidance as to how compliance would be possible once existing OEM parts are exhausted.

Sex symbol

A sex symbol is a celebrity of either sex, typically an actor, musician, supermodel, teen idol, or sports star, noted for being widely regarded as sexually attractive. The term was first used in the mid-1950s in relation to the popularity of certain film stars, notably Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot.
Cartoons.
According to Rotten Tomatoes, the 1930s cartoon character Betty Boop is "the first and most famous" sex symbol on animated screen. Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Kathleen Turner) from the 1988 live-action/animation crossover film "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" has been described as a sex symbol as well.
Video games.
Video games have had a few characters that are considered sex symbols; one example would be Lara Croft, who has had several appearances in mainstream media. Nell McAndrew, who portrayed Lara from 1998 to 1999 in media appearances, appeared in "Playboy" on August 1999, although the magazine was prevented legally from displaying the name "Lara Croft" next to the model.
Other sex symbols with less notoriety in the mainstream include Rayne, the first video game character that appeared in "Playboy", in its October 2004 US issue's article, "Gaming Grows Up"; and Nina Williams, voted "Hottest" Female Fighting Character in "Guinness World Records, Gamers Edition 2008".

War Horse Brewing Company

War Horse Brewing Company (formerly Barley Yards Brewing Company), part of the Three Brothers Wineries & Estates, is a microbrewery operated by Dave Mansfield and located on Seneca Lake in Geneva, New York. The brewery opened on May 24, 2008 and is the first brewery in the United States to brew a Riesling ale, made by blending the wort of an American-style wheat beer with ten percent juice from Riesling grapes. 
The Riesling ale.
Custom Brewcrafters, an offsite brewpub in Honeoye Falls, makes the Riesling ale for the War Horse brewery, blending wheat beer with New York Riesling juice. The two are then fermented together and sold by the growler at both breweries for about twelve dollars. The Riesling ale is currently their best seller, but they also brew a dark American-style lager, an India Pale Ale, a raspberry wheat beer and an amber ale, as well as a non-alcoholic root beer. The Riesling juice takes the edge off the normally bitter beer, which is 4.5 percent alcohol by volume. Dave Mansfield, owner of the War Horse brewery, credits his wife with the concept.
The tasting room.
The War Horse brewery is located inside a barn and its tasting room is designed to look like a World War II aircraft hangar. A steel curved ceiling and several model aircraft decorate the walls and displays. Patrons can order a flight of beer, which is served on miniature airplane wings that hold six tasting glasses each. One of the tasting counter's three sides can be opened to the outdoors during nice weather.

St Edward's Roman Catholic/Church of England School is a voluntary aided secondary school in Poole, Dorset in South West England. 
St Edwards turned 40 years old in 2003, and is one of a small number of joint Roman Catholic and Church of England secondary schools in the country.
Originally the school was only open to Roman Catholic students, but over time as the school has grown and as more students have been enrolled, the school has changed its status to accept Protestant students as well. As a result, the school is affiliated with both the Roman Catholic Diocese of Plymouth and the Anglican Diocese of Salisbury.
The school offers a wide variety of subjects at GCSE and has a growing sixth form for students continuing on to A-level. 
St Edward's school is linked with Bele Zinkuka school, South Africa, whose netball team visited the UK in 2005 and played against local schools in Poole.

Heros von Borcke

Johann August Heinrich Heros von Borcke (July 23, 1835 – May 10, 1895) was a German American cavalry officer in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War and in the Prussian Army during the Austro-Prussian War.
Biography.
Borcke was born in Festung Ehrenbreitstein, where his father Otto Theodor Heros von Borcke (1805–1878) served as a Second lieutenant in the Prussian Infantry Regiment 19. His father left service in 1836 to administer his family's estates of Wangerin in Pomerania and later Giesenbrügge (New March) (now Giżyn, Myślibórz County, Poland). Borcke was educated at the local school of Giesenbrügge, the gymnasium in Cölln (today a district of Berlin) and the Franckesche Stiftungen in Halle and joined the Prussian Army at the Gardes du Corps Cuirassier Regiment in Berlin.
American Civil War.
A tall man at 6' 4" and weighting in at more than 240 pounds, he was a lieutenant in the 2nd Brandenburg Regiment of Dragoons when news arrived of the beginning of the American Civil War. He eventually secured his release from his duties in the Prussian Army and sailed for the Bermuda, finally slipping into Charleston (South Carolina) Harbor on a blockade runner in May 1862. He brought with him a massive Solingen straight sword, which would become famous during his ensuing career. By the end of the month, he had made his way to Richmond, Virginia, the capital of the Confederacy. He was given the rank of captain in the Provisional Army of the Confederate States on June 1 of that year and assigned to Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart by the order of Secretary of War George W. Randolph. Von Borcke became a close confidant and aide to Stuart and, conspicuous on the battlefield for his large height and girth and the extremely large sword he wielded, became known as the "giant in gray."
Stuart soon was impressed by the new arrival, and the two became fast friends. Following the cavalry's famed "ride around McClellan's army", Stuart wrote, "Capt. Heros von Borcke, a Prussian cavalry officer, who lately ran the blockade, assigned me by the honorable Secretary of War, joined in the charge of the First Squadron in gallant style, and subsequently, by his energy, skill, and activity, won the praise and admiration of all".
In August of the year, von Borcke was promoted to the rank of major, an appointment confirmed by the First Confederate Congress on September 19. He rode with Stuart as his Chief of Staff and adjutant general during the Northern Virginia Campaign and the Maryland Campaign, further adding to his reputation for bravery in the face of the enemy. Stuart detailed him to accompany the body of fallen horse artillerist John Pelham to Richmond for burial following Pelham's death at the Battle of Kelly's Ford.
During the early phases of the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign, von Borcke suffered a significant wound from a bullet in his neck during the Battle of Middleburg and was incapacitated for the remainder of the year. He recovered enough to resume staff duties in the spring of 1864, and was present at the Battle of Yellow Tavern in which his superior Stuart was killed. In December of that year, he was promoted again, this time to lieutenant colonel and voted the official thanks of the Confederate Congress. He was also sent by President Jefferson Davis on a diplomatic mission to England.
Prussia.
With the collapse of the Confederacy in the spring of 1865 and the ensuing surrender of its main armies, von Borcke returned to his native Prussia. He resumed his military career and fought in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War in the personal staff of Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia, receiving the coveted Order of the Red Eagle for his gallantry. He married Magdalene Honig and raised three sons. Still suffering lingering effects from his Middleburg wound, he retired from the Prussian Army in 1867 and bought an estate at Sichts, West Prussia (today Żychce, Poland). After his father's death he returned to Giesenbrügge, where he proudly flew the Confederate flag from its battlements.
In 1866, von Borcke's memoirs of his adventures in the Confederate army were published in England as a two-volume set and then appeared in the U.S. the following year. In 1883, his wife died, and two years later, he married her sister Tony, they named their daughter Karoline Virginia in honor of Borcke's adopted state. In between, in 1884, he sailed back to again visit the United States and was reunited with many former comrades and friends, including Wade Hampton, William H. F. Lee, and Matthew C. Butler.
He died in Berlin in 1895 due to a sepsis caused by the remaining projectile which had wounded him in the Battle of Middleburg on 19 June 1863. His headstone over his grave in Giesenbrügge was destroyed by the Soviet army during World War II. The Sons of Confederate Veterans purchased a new headstone for the Confederate veteran, which was reinstalled in 2008.

Helping Grandma

Helping Grandma is a 1931 "Our Gang" short comedy film directed by Robert F. McGowan. It was the 103rd (15th talking episode) "Our Gang" short that was released.
Plot.
An older woman owns a small grocery store and the gang helps her run it by waiting on customers, delivering groceries, and keeping her company. They call her Grandma, though she is not any one kid's grandmother but everyone's grandma. She loves the gang and the gang loves her. A chain store company wants to buy her store for more than market value while a swindler also wants to buy it for next to nothing.
The gang thinks both parties want to practically steal the store away from her. The swindler stops in and tries talking Grandma into selling her store immediately for very little money. She balks and then goes downtown to run some errands leaving the gang in charge. Among her instructions is to tell anyone who calls on the telephone to call back later. Chain store officials then stop by and the gang tries to scare them away from buying the store. They leave as well. 
Meanwhile Wheezer and Dorothy tease Stymie and do not let him have any candy. When he tries to con them into giving him some, they have Stymie sampling dog food, oil, lard, lux, gasoline, and fertilizer. Dorothy is doling out candy to Wheezer when the phone rings. It's the chain store representatives, who want to increase their offer. Wheezer picks up the receiver but does not speak to the representatives, because he is distracted by Dorothy. Thinking she's not giving him enough candy (and therefore not hearing their offer), Wheezer shouts at Dorothy "T'aint enough!", then into the phone, "Call later!" The chain store reps think that "T'aint enough" was also meant for them and they decide to call back. This gag takes place repeatedly through the scene. Grandma returns along with the swindler who is in a rush to get her to sign away her store. She assumes she has signed the store away and tells the children that she just sold the store. The man then calls the kids hoodlums and tells them the store is his and he is the boss and they must leave. Grandma refuses to let him throw them out. Then the chain store officials arrive and the swindler states that the store now belong to him. He shows them the paper she signed and it was blank; the real bill of sale was not signed. Grandma also learns that the swindler pretended to be Grandma over the phone and told the officials she did not want to sell the place. The officials, repeating their phone bid, also say they will offer Grandma three times more than the original price agreed upon. The swindler accuses Grandma of tricking him. Grandma then socks the guy so hard he falls across the room. Wheezer then hits him on the head with a hammer.
Note.
This episode was heavily edited on the Little Rascals television prints beginning in 1971. Scenes with Stymie being teased were all cut out due to perceptions of racism toward African Americans. Most, but not all of the deleted scenes were reinstated on the TV prints shown on AMC from 2001–2003

Stolpe Abbey

Stolpe Abbey (}; founded 1153, dissolved 1534) was the first monastery in Pomerania. It was located on the southern bank of the Peene River between Gützkow and Anklam near the village of Stolpe.
Ratibor I, Duke of Pomerania, founded the abbey on 3 May 1153 in memory of his brother Wartislaw I. Wartislaw, who had subdued the area and converted its people to Christianity in the late 1120s, was killed near the site of the future monastery; according to legend he was murdered by a Liutician pagan.
The abbey was settled by Benedictine monks from Berge Abbey near Magdeburg. The Pomeranian dukes and the Counts of Gützkow granted the new foundation extensive lands in the vicinity. In 1164, a meeting between the Duke of Saxony, Henry the Lion, and King Valdemar I of Denmark was held here.
In 1304, the abbey became part of the Cistercian Order, and was made a daughter house of Pforta Abbey. In 1305, Kärkna Abbey (also known as Falkenau Abbey) and in 1319 Padise Abbey, both in Estonia, were put under the authority of Stolpe.
In 1534, Stolpe Abbey was dissolved in the course of the Protestant Reformation. The Thirty Years' War made a battleground of Stolpe and left the abbey buildings in ruins.

Holy See–United Kingdom relations

Holy See–United Kingdom relations are foreign relations between the Holy See and the United Kingdom.
History.
During the Middle Ages and until the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were Catholic kingdoms with diplomatic relations with the Papal States. In 1479 King Edward IV appointed John Sherwood as the first Resident Ambassador in the Papal States. Following the establishment of the Anglican Church by Henry VIII, diplomatic relations were broken in 1536. Relations were reestablished in 1553 under Queen Mary the Catholic, who appointed Sir Edward Carne as her Ambassador. It was during the reign of Elizabeth I that diplomatic relations were broken again, and Sir Edward Carne being recalled. Thereafter, English law prohibited any official relations with the Papal States. However, some random contacts were made between the two countries. In 1621, the English court despatched George Gage to the Papal court in order to obtain permission for the marriage of King Charles I and the Spanish Infanta, a marriage that didn't take place eventually. However, Charles I married a French Catholic princess named Henrietta Maria, this with the blessing of Pope Gregory XV, who used the opportunity to despatch as envoy to England Gregorio Panzani. Panzani was followed as Papal envoy by the Scottish Franciscan George Conn. 
In 1686 King James VII of Scotland and II of England despatched as envoy to the Papal States Earl Castlemaine and received Papal envoy Count Fernando D'Adda. However, relations were broken again following the Glorious Revolution in 1688. The Papal States recognised James Francis Edward Stuart as James VIII and III until his death in 1766, but not his son Charles, subtly giving recognition to the reigning House of Hanover. This helped start the reform of the anti-Catholic penal laws, such as the Quebec Act and the Papists Act 1778. Sir John Coxe Hippisley's brief mission to Rome in 1779–1780 failed; he was to explore the possibility of restoring relations.
Unofficial relations were formed again during the French Revolution, as both the British and the Papal courts were interested in coordinating policies against the spread of the revolution across Europe. In 1792 The British court despatched Sir John Coxe Hippisley to Rome as envoy, a position he held until 1795. The Papal court despatched Monsignor Charles Erskine to London as envoy, a position he held until 1801. Both countries found themselves at various times enemies of France during this period and therefore had a degree of commonality of interests, not least because of the Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution and the Roman Republic of 1798–99. 
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland came into existence in 1801 with the union of the Kingdom of Ireland to Great Britain (which had been formed from the union of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England in 1707). With the Anglo Irish Treaty of 1921 all of Ireland became an independent dominion, however Northern Ireland exercised its right under the Anglo-Irish Treaty to withdraw from the remainder of Ireland and maintain the union with Great Britain, thus creating the current state of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The Holy See is the preeminent episcopal see of the Catholic Church, forming the central government of the Church and recognized in international law as a sovereign entity with which diplomatic relations can be maintained. The Pastor Bonus an apostolic constitution, defines the Vatican's diplomatic relations with states as the Holy See. 
Due to the continuity of the Holy See from early times it is possible to see that the various parts of the United Kingdom had relations with the Holy See prior to their incorporation within the Union (and in Ireland's case, following it - see Holy See – Ireland relations). 
Following the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829, legal obstacles to relations with the Papal States were removed, but the British government still refrained from accrediting an envoy to Rome. However, British envoys to some Italian city states were also charged with conducting negotiations with the Papal court. During the Irish tenants'-rights Plan of Campaign in the 1880s, the Papacy condemned the activities in the encyclical "Saepe Nos" (1888), even though most of the tenants were Catholics. 
The United Kingdom did not re-establish relations until December 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War, as the British government was apprehensive about possible growing German and Austrian influence over Vatican policies. The first envoy selected for that purpose was Henry Howard, a British Catholic himself. However, in order to make the impression this diplomatic mission was temporary in nature, it was titled "Special Mission to the Vatican". It was only in 1923 that the mission's title was changed to "His Majesty's Legation to the Holy See".
The problem of Northern Ireland has been a major issue in British-Vatican relations, and during the 1970s the Holy See expressed its hopes for a speedy and just solution on the issue, as can be seen in the Papal message of Paul VI on 1 June 1974, calling on all armed factions to take part in peace talks:
"We earnestly beg that all violence should cease, from whatever side it may come, for it is contrary to the law of God and to a Christian and civilized way of life; that, in response to the common Christian conscience and the voice of reason, a climate of mutual trust and dialogue be reestablished in justice and charity; that the real and deep-seated causes of social unrest - which are not to be reduced to differences of a religious nature - be identified and eliminated".
as well as in the words of Paul VI to the British Minister Dugald Malcolm upon presenting his credentials on 19 June 1975,: 
"The difficulties you have mentioned which impede full understanding and cooperation in Northern Ireland are an anxious burden for us too. [- - -]
We bless the efforts of all those who are truly seeking a solution by means which are within the framework of God’s Law and for the benefit of all citizens without distinction".
The Holy See also supported the British efforts at bringing to an end the racial segregation policy in Rhodesia (present day Zimbabwe), as can be seen in the words of John Paul II to the British Minister Mark Evelyn Heath on 22 May 1980:
The good auspices under which Zimbabwe has joined the independent nations of the world can be attributed to an initiative of the British Government that happily combined courage with patience. I pray God to grant that such positive results will continue to come from the same source.
On 17 October 1980, the Pope sent a congratulatory message to Queen Elizabeth II, commending her for her activities for peace among nations, and for peace between Catholics and Anglicans.
John Paul II was also concerned with events in Poland surrounding the struggle between the Communist government and Solidarity movement, and his hopes for action by the British government can be seen in his statement to the first full British Ambassador to the Holy See as he presented his credentials on 1 April 1982:
I welcome the reference which you have made to recent events in Poland and your deep interest in the well-being of the Polish people. (- - -) Thus no country can fully enjoy its own freedom, knowing that in other countries the dignity of the human person is being violated.
Recent developments.
Full relations were recognised in 1982 when Pope John Paul II visited the UK. This led to the first ever UK – Holy See exchange of full Ambassadors in that year.
On 9 September 2011, Ambassador Nigel Marcus Baker presented his credentials to Pope Benedict XVI. In his speech, the British Ambassador presented three main goals of Vatican-UK relations, namely facing existential threats such as climate change and nuclear proliferation, promoting interfaith dialogue to achieve peace and working to reduce world poverty.
The UK Embassy to the Holy See is co-located with the UK Embassy to the Republic of Italy at Via XX Settembre in Rome. This follows the closing of the UK's Embassy to the Holy See's rented building in 2006 which led to protests from the Vatican "that senior Holy See officials cannot be expected to go to Villa Wolkonsky", the UK Embassy to the Italian Republic.
The Holy See's Nunciature to Great Britain is the diplomatic post of the Holy See whose representative is called the Apostolic Nuncio to Great Britain with the rank of an ambassador. The office of the nunciature is located at 54 Parkside, Wimbledon Village, London.
State visits.
Queen Elizabeth II first visited the Vatican (as Princess Elizabeth) during the pontificate of Pope Pius XII.
Her second visit to the Vatican was a private visit (during a state visit to the Italian Republic) on 5 May 1962 when she was received by Pope John XXIII.
She twice paid State Visits during the pontificate of John Paul II – firstly in 1980 and then in 2000.
Pope Benedict XVI became the first Pope to make an official Papal Visit to the United Kingdom on 16 September 2010, this was accorded the same status as a state visit. In a break with normal arrangements for state visits he arrived in Edinburgh rather than London and was granted an audience of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at her official residence in Scotland the Palace of Holyrood House. On the evening of the same day he celebrated only the second Papal Mass ever held in Scotland at Bellahouston Park in Glasgow, with over 250,000 Scottish Catholics participating in the celebration. The first Papal Mass in Scotland was celebrated by his predecessor Pope John Paul II at Bellahouston Park, Glasgow, during his Pastoral Visit in 1982.

Kuhn slide

The Kuhn slide (German: "Kuhnsche Schleife") is part of a modified Walschaerts (German:"Heusinger") valve gear on steam locomotives and is named after its inventor, Michael Kuhn (1851-1903). The term is also used to refer to this particular type of Walschaerts valve gear system as a whole.
Overview.
Problems often arise in incorporating a Walschaerts valve gear into the design of tank and narrow gauge locomotives because of space limitations. The reversing rod (with its lifting arm), needed to change between forward and reverse running, is therefore mounted at the same level as the pivot of the expansion link. This enables the lifting link (German: "Hängeeisen") to be dispensed with, and the lifting arm to be connected directly to the radius rod. To ensure the required horizontal movement, the back end of the radius rod is designed as a slide (the 'Kuhn slide') which fits into a rotatable crosshead ("Gleitstein") in the lifting arm.
Advantages.
The Kuhn valve gear was not as widespread as the classic Walschaerts valve gear as its production costs were higher. One advantage of the Kuhn slide is that it runs equally smoothly in either direction. For that reason it was preferred on tank locomotives which, for operational reasons, often had to run backwards for long periods.
Variations.
A variation of the Kuhn slide was developed by the Winterthur Locomotive Works. On the so-called Winterthur valve gear the expansion link itself is attached to the reversing shaft, both having a common pivot.

75th Oregon Legislative Assembly

The 75th Oregon Legislative Assembly convened beginning on , for its biennial regular session. All of the 60 seats in the House of Representatives and half of the 30 seats in the State Senate were up for election in 2008; the general election for those seats took place on .
Democrats took control of the Senate in the 2004 elections, and of the House in the 2006 elections. The Senate had been controlled by Republicans since 1997 and the House since 1990. Many Republican legislators resigned or declined to run for reelection in 2008. Democrats lost one seat in the Senate, and gained five in the House.
The Republican House caucus released an agenda for the 2009 session; priorities included improving economic growth, bringing accountability to state government, improving the state's education system, extending health care and extending in-home care for seniors, enhancing public safety, and managing natural resources.
House Majority Leader Dave Hunt (D–Gladstone) responded to the agenda in July 2008, characterizing it as a departure from the failed policies of the George W. Bush administration, and stating that the problems Republicans seek to solve resulted from 14 years of Republican leadership. The House Democrats also released an agenda for 2009.
The legislature, in its 2009 regular session, worked to close a budget shortfall brought on by the economic recession. Work on the budget will continue in 2010. One critical factor in the legislature's work is the fact that Democrats hold three fifths of the seats in each chamber, theoretically providing the three-fifths supermajority support required by the Oregon Constitution for bills to increase revenue.
In the effort to balance the budget, bills were passed to raise income taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals and households. This is expected to raise US$733 million in revenue over the next two years, which is meant to lessen the need to make spending cuts to state services and programs.
Opponents led an effort to force a statewide referendum on these increases, which appeared as Measures 66 and 67 on the special election ballot. They were both passed by voters and will take effect .
Sessions.
The Oregon Constitution requires the Legislative Assembly to hold regular sessions once every two years,
but the body can hold special sessions called by either the governor or the body itself. Only four other states' legislatures hold regular sessions every other year: Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, and Texas. Until November 2008, Arkansas was the sixth state.
In recent years, the Legislative Assembly has considered switching from biennial to annual regular sessions, as recommended by the Public Commission on the Oregon Legislature. To test the idea, the 74th legislature called itself into a special session in 2008, calling it a "supplemental" session to the regular one in 2007.
Likewise, the current legislative body will hold a supplemental session in 2010, expected to start and to last four weeks.
Among other tasks, the legislature plans to refer a ballot measure to voters to amend the state constitution to permanently change to annual sessions.
A ballot measure is required because all constitutional amendments must be approved by voters.
The legislature also plans to refer a constitutional amendment to voters to redirect tax rebate funds into a state reserve, or "rainy day," fund.
Notable legislation.
2009 regular session.
In the effort to balance the budget, House Bills 2639 and 3405 were passed, raising taxes on corporations, and on wealthy individuals and households, respectively. HB 3405 replaced the corporate minimum tax of $10, paid by two thirds of corporations in Oregon, with a sliding scale: At the bottom of the scale, corporations with sales under $500,000 in Oregon will pay $150; at the top, corporations with sales over $100 million will pay $100,000. Corporate income greater than $250,000 will be taxed 7.9 percent for two years, then 7.6 percent afterwards. Corporate income below this threshold will be taxed 6.6 percent. Under HB 2639, taxable income greater than $125,000 for individuals and $250,000 for joint filers will pay a rate of 10.8 percent for the next three years, up from 9 percent; after that, the rate drops to 9.9 percent. Also, income higher than $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for households will be taxed at 11 percent. These two bills are expected to raise $733 million in revenue over the next two years.
The bills cleared the Joint Ways and Means Committee on ,
and the House passed them .
Representative Mike Schaufler (D–Happy Valley) broke with Democrats and voted against both bills, but Rep. Greg Smith (R–Heppner) supported HB 2649, and Rep. Bob Jenson (R–Pendleton) voted for both bills. On , despite expectations that the bills would pass the Senate as easily as they did the House, they "crashed in dramatic fashion"
when Senator Mark Hass (D–Beaverton), believing the proposed tax increases should be temporary, joined Republicans and voted against HB 3405. Because no Republicans supported the bill, all 18 Democrats were needed to pass the bill, but Hass's rejection left only 17 votes of approval. The Senate tabled both bills and started negotiations. On , after Hass promised his support of both bills if some revenue from the corporate tax increases were added to the rainy day fund, the Senate voted again and passed both bills.
Governor Ted Kulongoski signed them , over a month later.
Opponents of these tax increases said they would worsen Oregon's economy, and they led an effort to force a statewide referendum on these increases.
Measures 66 and 67 qualified for the ballot on , and voters passed both measures on , less than a week before the legislature planned to hold a special session to continue to work on the budget.
Electoral fusion was made possible in Oregon with Senate Bill 326, allowing candidates to list a maximum of three party endorsements on their ballot line.
This used to be legal in Oregon until 1958. Some have called this plan "fusion light"
to contrast it with electoral fusion as practiced in states like New York, where each candidate gets a ballot line for each party that endorses them. SB 326 also repealed a 2005 law preventing voters who already participated in a party's nominating process from signing an independent candidate's nomination petition for a partisan office.
The 2005 law was a response to Ralph Nader's 2004 US presidential candidacy as an independent, raising concerns among Democrats that similar candidates would hurt their chances of being elected.
The law drew criticism when Ben Westlund, then an independent member of the state Senate, ran for governor in 2006. He had to wait until after the primary election to start his campaign and verify that the voters who signed his petition hadn't voted in any party's primary.
2010 supplemental session.
On , the day after Measures 66 and 67 passed, Governor Kulongoski said, "It's time to say 'enough' to budgeting from crisis to crisis," and directed the legislature to take up an effort in its supplemental session to reform Oregon's kicker law. Instead of sending surplus revenue back to taxpayers as tax rebates, Kulongoski wants surplus revenue to be directed to a state savings account first, commonly described as a "rainy day fund," to help the state balance its budgets during future recessions. House Speaker Hunt said the legislature will focus on jobs, and said kicker reform is "certainly not on the list of definitive things we plan to accomplish."
Senate members.
The Oregon State Senate is composed of 18 Democrats and 12 Republicans. In the last elections, the Democratic Party lost one seat: District 27, in the Bend area. Democrat Ben Westlund, a former Republican, left that seat to seek the statewide Oregon State Treasurer office in the same elections. Despite the loss, the Democrats maintained a three-fifths supermajority in the chamber.

Court documents obtained by the CBC allege Shory executed legal transactions misrepresenting the true owner of five separate properties in the Calgary area. The Bank allege its loses from the scheme at $30 million.
Shory responded in a statement on his website ""Through media stories, it has come to my attention that I have been named in a civil matter. I want to state that I have not yet been served with a statement of claim. When I am, I will defend myself vigorously against these accusations. I have done nothing wrong. Even the BMO was quoted in the Toronto Star this evening that: 'we do not allege fraud against him.' I want to personally thank the many constituents who have already expressed their support for me and for my family."

Babouk

Babouk is a political-themed novel by Guy Endore, a fictionalized account of the Haitian Revolution told through the eyes of its titular slave. Though virtually unknown today, "Babouk" has gained some notoriety in academic circles through its attempted linking of the slave trade with capitalism, and one professor has suggested that it would make a valuable addition to post-colonial literary discourse by steering it in the direction of Communism. Endore might well have agreed. A committed leftist, he spent many months in Haiti researching the story that would become "Babouk", and much of his findings make their way into the text, either in the form of epigraphs or explicitly noted in the text itself. "Babouk" is also notable for the digressions the narrator makes from the main narrative, in order to espouse pro-communist sympathies.
Background.
Endore, a popular writer and staunch socialist (who would later become a Stalinist), had in 1933 published his book "The Werewolf of Paris", which became a financial success. Hoping to profit on his newfound bankability, he was contracted by Simon & Schuster to write another novel that would be in the same mystery vein. Endore, who spoke French, decided to write a romance set against the backdrop of the Haitian Revolution, and went to Haiti to conduct research on the slave trade. Horrified by what he learned, he became particularly interested in the story of a rebellious slave named Dutty Boukman, who many consider to be the catalyst behind the Haitian slave rebellion. Endore created a fictionalized version named Babouk, but he also used his story to try to tell an anti-capitalist parable that borrowed much of its philosophy from Karl Marx. The resulting manuscript was dubbed by the publishing house of Simon and Schuster to be, "a powerful, moving piece of work. It won't sell because it's just too horrible." The book was not successful, and it languished in obscurity until it was chosen by the leftist journal Monthly Review to be published as part of its "Voices of Resistance" series. The republished novel included a foreword by writer Jamaica Kincaid and an afterword by historians David Barry Gaspar and Michel-Rolph Trouillot. It was published in 1991 by Monthly Review Press. 
Plot summary.
Babouk is a slave renowned by many tribes for his excellent storytelling abilities. He is captured by the French and taken to Saint Domingue to work on the sugar cane fields. Unaware of the reasons for his capture and hoping to be reunited with his lost love Niati, Babouk escapes his slave compound and wanders into the forest, only to meet some indigenous Americans. He is soon captured by Maroons (runaway slaves who agree to turn in other runaways on the condition that they are allowed their freedom) and returned to the compound, where his ear is cut off. Such a traumatic experience forces him to remain absolutely silent for several years, doing his labor without complaint but also without much energy. He eventually can maintain his silence no longer, and he re-establishes himself as a great storyteller. Unhappy with the way the slave masters treat him (although they claim otherwise), Babouk becomes the figurehead for a group of slaves that intend to revolt against their masters. Babouk and his group are initially successful in their endeavors, but are eventually held back by the combined might of the French and British military. Babouk's arm is severed after he tries to stop a cannon from firing by sticking his hand into it; he is then beheaded and his head is put on a pike as a warning to other slaves who might try to draw inspiration from Babouk. The novel ends with an impassioned statement from Endore that warns of the inevitability of a race war as the result of the white man's transgressions.
Major themes.
"Babouk" very explicitly highlights the supposed relationship between the slave trade and capitalism. Endore often removes himself from the principal narrative involving Babouk in order to talk about certain historical accounts he researched for the book itself, and he liberally passes severe judgment over those who were either involved in the slave trade or, more controversialy, those whom he supposed passively continued its existence by not questioning the capitalist system. Endore also makes the point of comparing racist practices of the eighteenth century with contemporary ones, and rejects the notion that men are treated equally in the United States, even if that is what the Constitution claims. "Babouk"'s narrative voice is also heavily infused with irony, often taking the side of the slave masters or pro-slavery ideologues in an effort to further highlight what he sees as the absurdity of their position. He also openly mocks the production of what he believes to be useless objects to project status, such as jewelry.
Critical reception.
"Babouk" received almost universally lukewarm reviews after its 1934 release, even from sources that would normaly be sympathetic to the anti - slavery part of his message. Generally, book critics agreed that Babouk's story had "epic possibilities" that did not reach fruition. The "New Republic" wrote, "'Babouk' is a horrible and an unforgettable book, but it somehow misses being a great, tragic or memorable one." Most published reviewers disliked Endore's frequent political digressions, believing they were poorly written, broke the power of the narrative, and only worsened as the novel progressed. "The Nation" declared that "The book is full...of interesting facts, observations, and descriptions. But...the denunciation of capitalism as slavery...is bad writing, almost fake poetry." Paul Allen authored the harshest review when he rejected the linkage of the voluntary exchange of capitalism and the forced labor of slavery, and wrote: "the heavy irony and the strident shrieking about the brotherhood of man culminating, on the last two pages of the book, in gibberish and exclamation points, practically ruins the book as either literature or propaganda."
A review in the NAACP house organ "The Crisis" lauded "Babouk", stating "Here is a book that should be in the bookcase of every Negro
family...speaking through Babouk, and seeing through the slaves' eyes, the author punctures all the cruelty, greed, pomp
and vainglory of whites with deadly rapier thrusts".

The Rebel Without Claws

The Rebel Without Claws is a "Looney Tunes" cartoon animated short starring Tweety and Sylvester. Released July 15, 1961, the cartoon is written and directed by Friz Freleng. The voices were performed by Mel Blanc.
The cartoon, one of a number of Warner Bros. cartoons set during the American Civil War, is a play on the movie title "Rebel Without a Cause".
Story.
Although the American Civil War was not an unheard-of subject in the "Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies" series, "Rebel Without Claws" is unusual in that it portrays the Confederate States Army in a sympathetic light, while casting a negative focus on the Union and its Army. Likewise, the short is a remake of the 1944 short "Plane Daffy", albeit with WWII references replaced by Civil War environment and other politically correct changes.
Here, the Confederates want to get an "important message" to General Robert E. Lee, but all the carrier pigeons have been shot down. The soldiers realize that Tweety is their last hope and turn to him for their mission. The Union soldiers learn of the Confederates' attempt and counter with their "Messenger Destroyer," who turns out to be none other than Sylvester. "I tawt I taw a damn Yankee tat," says Tweety just before the chase begins.
The bulk of the cartoon uses battle gags, such as Sylvester getting blown out of a cannon; Tweety momentarily tricking Sylvester into thinking Union soldiers are marching to battle (Sylvester tries to confront the canary but is blown away by Confederate soldiers); and Tweety hiding behind cannons on a fighter ship (Sylvester takes the brunt of more explosions).
Eventually, Sylvester disguises himself as General Lee and grabs Tweety. The bird is taken to the firing line for execution. He states that his only regret is that he has "but one wife to give foh my countwy" (paraphrasing Nathan Hale), to which Sylvester says that "he" has "nine" lives, But the commander and his soldiers prove incompetent — they shoot Sylvester instead! "It's a good thing I "have" got nine lives! With "this" kind of an army, I'll "need" 'em!"

Daniel (Nushiro) of Japan

Metropolitan is a Japanese clergyman and monk of the Japanese Orthodox Church. Since 2000 he is the primate of the Japanese Orthodox Church, by virtue of the office of the Archbishop of Tokyo. He is thus is the spiritual leader of almost 30,000 Japanese Orthodox Christians.
Early life.
Metropolitan Daniel was born into a Japanese Orthodox family in Toyohashi, Aichi, and was baptized as Jude. After he graduated with a degree in French literature from Aichi University in 1962, he studied theology at Tokyo Orthodox Seminary until 1965. He went to Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Crestwood, New York. In 1968 he finished his study at Saint Vladimir 1968 and was ordained to the diaconate. 
Upon his return to Japan, he served as a deacon at Tokyo Resurrection Cathedral from November 1970 till 1972. In 1972 he was ordained a priest and served in Toyohashi, until 1999.
Appointment to the primacy.
In 1999 his predecessor, Metropolitan Theodosius (Nagashima) of Japan died, and the Japanese Orthodox Church decided to elect three bishops and Jude Nushiro was considered as a good candidate for bishopric, as his wife had predeceased him. On August 20, 1999 he received his monastic tonsure and became known as monk Daniel, and was consecrated a bishop on November 14, 1999. The Japanese Orthodox Church had planned to enthrone Bishop Peter (Arihara) of Yokohama as successor to the late Metropolitan Theodosius, and appoint Daniel to the Bishopric of Kyoto, but the sudden death of Peter in this year changed their plan entirely. Daniel was then considered the successor of Theodore, and elevated to the rank of archbishop and metropolitan. On May 14, 2000 Daniel was enthroned to the Archbishop of Tokyo and Metropolitan of All Japan, consecrated by Patriarch Alexy II of Russia who visited Japan for his enthronement and other bishops.
Spiritual leadership.
Daniel is a prolific writer and insightful preacher with humor and plain wording. He issues tracts both focusing on daily reading and theological issues and the latter type of his writing is published as brochures for the education of the faithful. In his leadership a male monastery was founded in Tokyo in 2005, near to the Resurrection Cathedral.
He gained some popularity in the Russian internet in January 2009, before the election of the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia. A group of laity started a website, where all users could vote for the future Patriarch. As a result, Daniel, "only bishop not directly related to the former USSR", took the first place ahead of Kirill. The administration of the website zapatriarha.ru then zeroed votes for Daniel and excluded him from a list of candidates, explaining his high ratings as the result of a "hacker attack". Such actions caused Internet voters to accuse the website creators of promoting Kirill.

William Dorrinton

William Dorrinton (29 April 1809 – 8 November 1848) was an English cricketer for Kent, Hampshire, Suffolk and the Marylebone Cricket Club in a 94–match first–class career which began in 1836 and lasted until 1847, a year before his death. While Dorrinton has two first–class wickets to his name, he became a wicket keeper part–way through his career, taking 89 catches and performing 25 stumpings.
Early life.
William Dorrinton was born in West Malling, Kent, in 1809, second son to father Thomas Dorrinton, who himself played two club cricket matches for Rochester against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1800. William's brother, Alban Dorrinton, was nine years his senior and also played club cricket, and one first–class match for Kent in 1836.
William Dorrinton began his career in the 1836 cricket season with two matches for Kent, scoring 16 runs at 4.00 and a high score of only seven. In his debut match, Kent faced Sussex on 8 August. Dorrinton scored a duck and his season–best seven with the bat, playing his debut match alongside fellow debutant Thomas Miles Adams. In Dorrintons only other match of the season, also against Sussex, he scored five and four. It was in this match that his brother Alban also debuted.
Cricketing career.
Early years.
In 1837, Dorrinton continued to play only sporadically for Kent, appearing in four matches that season, scoring seven runs overall at an average of 1.00. In 1838 and 1839 he again played two matches each, scoring six runs at 2.00 and 11 runs at 3.66. This second season total was all accrewed in a single innings of 11 runs. In 1840 he played two more matches, scoring 27 runs across the season, at 9.00 with a high score of 22, all career bests. He also took his first wicket on in a rare bowling spell. His form continued into his first substantial season for Kent in 1841, where he played in seven matches, scoring 86 runs in the season at 8.60 with a high score of 21. In 1842 his batting continued to return career best figures with 118 runs from eight matches at 9.83, including a high score of 31.
Golden years.
The period from 1843 until 1847 were Dorrintons most successful on the cricket pitch. In 1843 he played seve matches, scoring 90 runs at 7.50 with a high score of 24. It was during this season that he supplemented his career at Kent by playing for Hampshire, prior to the clubs elevation to full county status. Dorrinton began his most prolific years in 1844, where he played a total of 16 matches, scoring career bests of 310 runs at 10.00 with one half century, a score of 50 for the MCC, for which he also began playing. This was also his most successful year in the field, taking 16 catches and taking the wicket-keepers position for the first time and returning with five stumpings. He would continue to use the gloves each season for the remainder of his career.
He continued to represent both Kent, Hampshire and the MCC in 1845, playing 19 matches and bettering his previous year with the highest statistics of his career, 522 runs at 15.35, with two half centuries and a high score of 65. He continued with the gloves, taking 13 catches and completing six stumpings. He also took his second and final first–class wicket. By the end of the 1845 season, however, Dorrinton left Hampshire, and in the following season he left the MCC to play only for Kent.
Decline and death.
The 1846 season saw his batting form drop, however, with a reduced 11 appearances returning only 99 runs at 4.95, with a highscore of 25. He continued to hold the gloves, taking 13 catches and completing three stumpings In 1847 Dorrinton joined Suffolk as well as continuing at Kent, and enjoyed a slight rise in form, scoring 105 runs from 10 matches, including a best score of 34*, at 6.17. He also took 12 catches and performed eight stumpings He left Suffolk at the end of 1847, to once again begin the next season playing only for Kent. The final season of his career in 1848 was, however, one of little success. In only four appearances he scored 43 runs at 7.16, at no time passing 16 runs, and took only five catches and performed three stumpings. Dorrinton retired from Kent that year. He was chosen to play one match for the All England XI late in the season on 20 September. Opening the batting, he scored three and one, took three catches and performed one stumping, however he did not return to the cricket field again, and just over a year later died in his home town in Kent.

Kirsopp Lake

Kirsopp Lake (7 April 1872 – 10 November 1946) was a New Testament scholar and Winn Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Harvard Divinity School. He had an uncommon breadth of interests, publishing definitive monographs in New Testament textual criticism, Greek palaeography, theology, and archaeology. He is probably best known for the massive five-volume work "The Beginnings of Christianity"—an edition, translation, commentary, and study of the Acts of Apostles—that he conceived and edited with F. J. Foakes-Jackson.
Early life.
Kirsopp Lake was born in Southampton, England, on 7 April 1872, the elder of two surviving children of George Anthony Kirsopp Lake, a physician, and Isabel Oke Clark. His father came from a family of Scottish origin and Kirsopp was the family name of the boy's paternal grandmother. He was educated at St Paul's School, London and then went up to Lincoln College, Oxford, matriculating in 1891. He attended as an Exhibitioner and was the Skinners' Company's Scholar in 1893, finally graduating (B.A., 1895) with a second class in theology. He also attended Cuddesdon Theological College in 1895. He originally had intended to read law and to pursue a career in politics. However, an overdose of exercise, too soon after influenza, affected his heart and he was told by doctors that law and politics were out of the question. According to his son, "he was delicate and the church seemed to give the opportunity for a living and for some influence over the society 
that interested him."
Curate in England.
Following graduation Lake was ordained a deacon in the Church of England (1895) and served as curate in Lumley, Durham, where he preached to the pitmen and miners in that North Country mining district. "I do not believe that theology entered very much into his sermons," recalls his son, "but he did conduct The Mikado and he still tells the story of the brawny pitman who, having rescued him from the attack of a drunken navvy from a neighbouring village and listened to his comments on the situation, said 'Mon, he's no much to look at, but has he no a bonny tongue?!'" After a years service he was ordained priest (1896), however he had further issues with his heart and decided to return to Oxford, to the less rigorous climate of the South in order to improve his health.
He earned his M.A. in 1897 and from that year to 1904 he served as curate of St. Mary the Virgin, Oxford, a much more academic atmosphere. During these years, in order to supplement his income, he also took a job cataloging Greek manuscripts in the Bodleian Library. That activity aroused in him an interest in the Synoptic problem and matters of New Testament textual criticism, and saw the publication of his first book, the very useful handbook "The Text of the New Testament" (1900). Some sixty years later Stephen Neill describes the 6th ed. (1928) as "still the best short introduction to New Testament textual criticism that exists in any language." It was most likely the influence exerted over him by F. C. Conybeare, Fellow of University College, Oxford, which was the main factor in Lake's development. It was Conybeare who initiated Lake into the mysteries and problems of New Testament palaeography and textual criticism. Lake's palaeographical interests led him in search of more manuscripts and in 1898 he undertook a trip to the libraries of Basel, Venice, and Rome. The fruits of that trip were published in "Codex 1 of the Gospels and Its Allies" (1902). Lake had discovered a textual family of New Testament manuscripts known as Family 1 (also known as "Lake group"). To this family belong minuscules: 1, 118, 131, and 209. In the summers of 1899 and 1903 (and many thereafter) he undertook trips in search of manuscripts to the Greek monasteries on Mount Athos. He published (1903, 1905, 1907) editions of several manuscripts uncovered there, a catalogue of all the manuscripts inspected, and even a history of the monasteries themselves (1909). In 1902 he won the Arnold Essay Prize at Oxford University for his study "The Greek Monasteries in South Italy," which was published in four installments in the "Journal of Theological Studies," vols. 4 and 5.
On 10 November 1903, he married Helen Courthope Forman (1874 – 22 October 1958), the daughter of Freda Gardiner and Sidney Mills Forman, a businessman of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Northumberland. They had two children, Gerard Anthony Christian Kirsopp Lake(27 December 1904 – 3 September 1972) and Agnes Freda Isabel Kirsopp Lake (31 July 1909 – 3 November 1993). It was also during these later years of his curacy that Lake "began to doubt the teachings of the church and to think in terms of history and exegesis rather than theology and parish difficulties." As his son reports, my father "has often said that the turning point in his belief in the church came when his Vicar suggested that prayers be said at Vespers for a Mr. Brown, since the doctor had just announced that there was no hope for him. The story may be apocryphal but I think it is indicative of his point of view." His daughter Agnes, "in conversations, was less polite and oblique: 'Heresy' was her word, pronounced with glee and gusto." This type of thinking may have run in the family, for Lake told Alfred North Whitehead in 1922 that his father, the physician, "being asked late in life what had done the most in his lifetime to relieve human suffering, answered, 'Anaesthesia and the decay of Christian theology.'"
Professor in Leiden.
In addition to his inaugural lecture, Lake published two important books on historical and exegetical matters concerning the New Testament during his time in Leiden: "The Historical Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ" (1907) and "The Earlier Epistles of St. Paul: Their Motive and Origin" (1911). As Metzger explains: "These studies, particularly the latter, revealed Lake's ability to analyze and evaluate complex historical and literary data and to set forth scholarly reconstructions with clarity and a certain persuasiveness." In "Historical Evidence" Lake sets forth his approach: "The first task of the historical inquirer is to collect the pieces of evidence; the second is to discuss the trustworthiness and meaning of each separate piece; and the third is to reconstruct the events to which the evidence relates" (p. 6). As for the reconstruction, he explains: "In any such attempt it is desirable to remember that the reconstruction of an original tradition from forms of later dates and of divergent contents must be guided by exactly the same principle as is the reconstruction of an original text from a number of extant MSS. In each case the fundamental problem is the retracing of the line of development followed by the various authorities, and the solution depends chiefly on the ability to detect errors of transmission and to explain their existence" (p. 167). As for "The Earlier Epistles", Neill writes: "I think that those of us who read Lake when we were young will be inclined to think that this is one of the best books on the New Testament that has ever been written in the English language. This is the way it ought to be done. Under Lake's skillful guidance, we feel ourselves one with those new and struggling groups of Christians, in all the perplexities of trying to discover what it means to be a Christian in a non-Christian world. And there is the Apostle, so very much in working clothes and without a halo; we feel in our bones the passionate eagerness of Paul for better news from Corinth, the passionate relief when the good news arrives." The book brought the conclusions of the German history of religions school to the attention of English-speaking world for the first time, and all later New Testament study has been influenced by this book.
Harvard years.
In the fall of 1913 Lake traveled to the United States to lecture for a year at the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts and to deliver the Lowell Lectures in Boston. Just before he was to leave for Europe he was offered a position at Harvard Divinity School, which he accepted. In the announcement of his hiring it was reported: "He comes when there is no definite gap to be filled, but merely because his eminent scholarship could add to the teaching strength of Harvard." From 1914 until 1919 he was professor of early Christian literature. Then in 1919, following the retirement of Ephraim Emerton, he was appointed to a Harvard chair becoming the Winn Professor of Ecclesiastical History, which he held until 1932. From 1915 to 1919 he was also a lecturer in New Testament at Union Theological Seminary in New York City.
While at Harvard Lake labored to bring forth the monumental five volume work "The Beginnings of Christianity". "Beginnings" was a project that had been conceived during conversations with F. J. Foakes-Jackson while Lake was still at the Leiden University, sometime before 1912 (vol. v, p. vii). It sought to investigate the view "that Christianity in the first century achieved a synthesis between the Greco-Oriental and the Jewish religions in the Roman Empire. The preaching of repentance, and of the Kingdom of God begun by Jesus passed into the sacramental cult of the Lord Jesus Christ. But the details are complex and obscure. What were the exact elements in this synthesis? How was it effected?" (vol. i, p. vii). The undertaking began at Cambridge University in the form of a seminar, presided over by F. C. Burkitt. It "was largely attended by scholars of the most varied interests in the University, not only theological, but historical, classical, mathematical, and Oriental ... Lake paid frequent visits from Leiden" and "the United States and Canada were not unrepresented" (vol. v, p. vii). The project was to be a grand endeavor. The five volumes that were ultimately published only comprise "Part I". As they explain: "Before, however, attempting to reconstruct this history we believed it necessary to study Acts in the light of the results of modern criticism. ... Later on we hope to return to the subject and reconsider the narrative of the life of Jesus, and the influence on the Church of his own teaching and of the teaching of others about him" (vol. ii, p. v). As it turned out they were never able to "return to the subject" and complete the project. "In sum," writes Baird, ""The Beginnings of Christianity" is a monumental work—the most extensive investigation of a NT book by English-speaking scholarship" (cf. vol. v, p. ix).
During his early years at Harvard, Lake continued to be active with The Churchmen's Union, an Anglican society for the advancement of liberal religious thought. He and Foakes-Jackson lent their support to H. D. A. Major in organizing a conference of Modern Churchmen (which continues till this day). The first was held at Ripon, Yorkshire, 3–6 July 1914. Foakes-Jackson and Lake delivered an attack on Liberal Protestantism. Lake said that the task of the liberal Christian is "not to go back upon the inherited Catholic doctrines of the Church, but to apply and to expand them, because we see that in the end they are true so long as you do not limit them." The most famous of the conferences was the one held at Girton College, Cambridge, 8–15 August 1921. Its subject was "Christ and the Creeds" and it was planned as a response to Lake's publication of the first volume of "The Beginnings of Christianity". Lake did not attend, so it was left to Foakes-Jackson to defend their positions. He explained that he and Lake believed that the Jesus whom the early Church preached was not "a character of singular charm and beauty during his life on earth, but a Risen Saviour who was expected to come speedily to judge the quick and the dead." Liberal Protestants, he argued, were preaching a Christ who had no historical foundation. From 1915 to 1931 Lake served as one of vice presidents of the union; however, after 1927 he began to part company with English Modernism and in 1932 he wrote to have his name removed from the list of vice presidents.
In 1932 Lake's personal affairs produced quite a scandal. On 18 August 1932, Lake obtained a Reno divorce from his first wife Helen, whom he had been separated from for five years. Then, on 16 December 1932, he married his former student and collaborator Silva Tipple New (18 March 1898 – 30 April 1983). She was 26 years his junior, married, with four children. They had one child John Anthony Kirsopp (b. 13 June 1928). At the time Silva was a professor of classics at Bryn Mawr, and an accomplished scholar in her own right. She would continue to collaborate with Lake for the rest of his life. The divorce caused such a stir that Lake was forced to resign the Winn chair on 28 September 1932 and became professor of history in Harvard College, a position he held until his retirement in 1938. Perhaps their most significant project was a magnificent series of ten large albums of facsimiles entitled "Dated Greek Minuscule Manuscripts to the Year 1200" (1934–39). These portfolios of reproductions were organized by location and contained photographic specimens of some 400 manuscripts. These were important publications, for they encouraged scholars to look beyond the more well known manuscripts and realize the worth of encompassing a wide range of textual variants in any editing of the Greek text. Together they also founded in 1934 a series of monographs entitled "Studies and Documents" and contributed a valuable study in 1941 on "Family 13 (The Ferrar Group)", another New Testament manuscript group.
During his 23 years at Harvard, Lake continuously taught one very popular course, the English Bible, familiarly known as "English 35". When he taught the course for the first time in 1914, the course had less than 40 students, whereas his final year there were over 250—a "625 per cent increase," as the Harvard Crimson touted when announcing his final lecture would be 16 December 1937. His book "An Introduction to the New Testament" (1937) is a "skeleton of the course." However, "it does not give the flesh put on that skeleton by the lecturer" (p. ix). It was of course that "flesh" which made the course so interesting, due to Lake's lively imagination and engaging wit. As he himself explains: "The most important thing in a teacher's life is not to impart the knowledge of facts—which can be found much better in books—but to encourage another generation to look steadfastly at the vision which it sees, and to face its own problems in the light of that vision, controlled and guided by an understanding of what the past has done or not done" ("Paul, His Heritage and Legacy", 1934, p. xii). He seems to have been effective, for James Luther Adams, one of his students during 1924-27, recalls: "It was his characteristic interest to make historical figures come alive, so that we might see their significance today and not merely study them as so many items from a dead past." "Something we all recognized in Kirsopp Lake," writes Adams, "was that he had the imagination of a Sherlock Holmes. He took an almost childlike interest in digging out alternative answers to historical questions ... Students who thought themselves completely secularized and immune to any 'religious nonsense' attended his lectures and heard him publicly burrow down into the biblical concepts, taking as his point of departure something highly imaginative in one of the parables, and then rise up to fly with it. The students used to call his courses 'Kirsopp's Fables.'"
In addition to the Lowell Lectures, which he delivered at the Lowell Institute and King's Chapel in Boston in 1913, Lake was the Haskell Lecturer at Oberlin College in 1919; the Ingersoll Lecturer at Harvard University in 1922; the Ichabod Spencer Lecturer at Union College, Schenectady in 1923; and Flexner Lecturer at Bryn Mawr College in 1932. Lake served as president of the Society of Biblical Literature for two terms, 1941-42. He was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a corresponding member of the Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften, and in 1941 honorary fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford. At Harvard, he was made an adopted member of the class of 1894. He received the honorary degrees of D.D. from the University of St Andrews (1911), Th.D. from Leiden University (1922), Litt.D. from the University of Michigan (1926), and Ph.D. from Heidelberg University (1936). Also in 1936 he was awarded the Burkitt Medal for Biblical Studies from the British Academy. Lake was a mason and one of the driving forces in establishing The Harvard Lodge A.F. & A.M., the first academic Masonic Lodge in the country, on 18 May 1922 and served as chaplain. His recreations were golf, chess, and croquet. Lake died of arteriosclerotic heart failure at his home in South Pasadena, California on 10 November 1946. He was buried at Glen Haven Memorial Park, San Fernando, California.
Lake's daughter Agnes Kirsopp Lake Michels was a noted classical scholar. In later years she reflected on the impact he had on her life: "my general interests should be attributed mainly to the influence of my father who was a New testament scholar with a classical education and a passionate love of beauty. He told me the stories of the classics and, long before I could understand them, read to me a strange assortment of Browning and the Bible; Swinburne, Tennyson, and Josephus. His attitude to his own work made me think of scholarship as the opening to a world of adventure, not as a retirement from reality." His grandson Anthony Lake is a diplomat.

Prussian estates

The Prussian estates (, ) were representative bodies of Prussia, first created by the Monastic state of Teutonic Prussia in the 14th century (around 1370s) but later becoming a devolved legislature for Royal Prussia within the Kingdom of Poland. They were at first composed of officials of six big cities of the region; Braunsberg (Braniewo), Culm (Chełmno), Elbing (Elbląg), Danzig (Gdańsk), Königsberg (Królewiec) and Thorn (Toruń). Later, representatives of other towns as well as nobility were also included. The estates met on average four times per year, and discussed issues such as commerce and foreign relations.
Era of Teutonic Prussia.
Originally, the Teutonic Order created the Estate to appease the local citizens, but over time the relations between the Order and the Estates grew strained, as the Order of knights treated the local population with contempt.
Different Prussian holders of the privilege of coinage (among them the Order and some cities), actually committed to issue a Prussian currency of standardised quality, had debased the coins and expanded their circulation in order to finance the wars between Poland and Teutonic Prussia. However, this expansion disturbed the equilibrium of coins circulated to the volume of contractual obligations, only coming down to a harsh depreciation of all existing nominally fixed contractual obligations by inflating all other non-fixed prices measured by these coins, ending only once the purchasing power of every extra issued coin equalled its material and production costs.
"Obligations would be retroactively changed if new coins, too plentifully issued, would be counted as equal to the old ones (1526, lines 307-310)." Thus a law was "passed by the Diet of Teutonic Prussia in 1418 (cf. Max Toeppen, 1878, 320seqq.), smartly regulating the fulfilment of old debts fixed in old currency by adding an agio when repaid by new coins." Thus creditors and recipients of nominally fixed revenues were not to lose by debasement-induced inflation.
As Prussia became increasingly tied economically and politically with Poland, and the wars became more and more devastating to the borderlands, and as the policies and attitude of the King of Poland were more liberal towards the Prussian burghers and nobility than that of the Order, the rift between the Teutonic Knights and their subjects widened.
The Estates drifted towards the Kingdom of Poland in their political alignment. Norman Housley noted that "The alienation of the Prussian Estates represented a massive political failure on the part of the Order".
At first, the estates opposed the Order passively, by denying requests for additional taxes and support in Order wars with Poland; by 1440s Prussian estates acted openly in defiance of the Teutonic Order, rebelling against the knights and siding with Poland militarily (see Lizard Union, Prussian Confederation and the Thirteen Years' War).
Era of Ducal and Royal Prussia within Poland and Poland-Lithuania.
The estates eventually became governed by Kingdom of Poland. First the western part of Prussia, which became known as Royal Prussia after the Second Peace of Thorn ended the Thirteen Years' War in 1466, and later the eastern lands, known as Ducal Prussia, after the Prussian Homage in 1525, became part of the kingdom. On 10 December 1525 at their session in Königsberg the Prussian estates established the Lutheran Church in Ducal Prussia by deciding the Church Order.
Nicolaus Copernicus, then canon of the Prince-Bishopric of Ermeland, addressed the Prussian estates with three memoranda, in fact little essays, on currency reform. Debasements continued to ruin Prussian finances, the groat had been debased by 1/5 to 1/6 of its prior bullion content. In 1517, 1519 and again in 1526 he suggested to return to the law passed in 1418. However, especially the cities refused that. They had raised most of the funds for the warfares, and now lightened their debt burden by debasing their coins, thus passing on part of the burden to receivers of nominally fixed revenues, such as civic and ecclesiastical creditors and civic, feudal and ecclesiastical collectors of nominally fixed monetarised dues. So Copernicus' effort failed. At least the estates refused to peg the Prussian currency to the Polish (as proposed by Ludwig Dietz), which even suffered a worse debasement than the Prussian.
Under Polish sovereignty, Prussians, particularly those from the Royal Prussia, saw their liberties confirmed and expanded; local cities prospered economically (Gdańsk become the largest and richest city in the Commonwealth), and local nobility participated in the benefits of Golden Liberty, such as the right to elect the king. Royal Prussia, as a direct part of the Kingdom of Poland (and later Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) had more influence on Polish politics and more privileges than Ducal Prussia, which remained a fief (for example, while nobles from the Royal Prussia had their own sejmiks, Sejm and Senate representatives, those from the Duchy did not. Royal Prussia also had its own parliament, the Prussian "Landesrat", although it was partially incorporated into the Commonwealth Sejm after the Union of Lublin, it retained distinct features of Royal Prussia.
Era of the Kingdom of Prussia.
With the power of the Commonwealth waning from the mid-17th century onwards the Estates drifted under the influence of the Hohenzollern Electors of Brandenburg, ruling Ducal Prussia in personal union since 1618 (first the eastern Duchy of Prussia, sovereign after the Treaty of Wehlau in 1657 and upgraded to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701, then the western Royal Prussia, annexed to the former after the First Partition of Poland in 1772). Under the Hohenzollern's absolutist rule the power of the estates would be increasingly limited.
The West and East Prussian estates, separately, the latter gathering after 1772 representatives of newly formed East Prussia, comprising the former Duchy of Prussia and the parts of former Royal Prussia west of the Vistula, played again a role in the transformation from feudal traditional agriculture to agricultural business. The Silesian Wars had imposed high taxes so that many Prussian tax-payers went into debts. Feudal manor estates were no free property sellable at the will of their holders or – in case of over-indebtedness – by way of execution prompted by the creditors of the holders. So it was difficult for the holders of feudal manor estates to borrow against their estates. Therefore in 1787 the West Prussian estates, and the year after the East Prussian estates, took on the task to form each a credit corporation called the Westpreussische Landschaft and the Ostpreussische Landschaft, respectively.
Members of the estates, then by status mostly noble landed manor holders, and the circle of potential debtors were literally the same. In order to overcome the restrictions on selling manor estates to fulfill outstanding debts the manor estate holders formed a corporation of mutually liable debtors. So solvent manor estate holders had to step in for over-indebted borrowers, thus transforming the manor estate holders into a corporation of collective liability. Coming up for over-indebted borrowers imposed hardship for the solvent manor estate holders. This strengthened many one's opinion and even aroused appeals to abolish the feudal system of manor estate holding, while others demanded the re-establishment of pure feudalism without borrowing at all.
In the Napoleonic era the East Prussian estates gained some political influence again. King Frederick William III of Prussia needed to raise funds in order to pay the enormous French war contributions of thaler 140 million imposed after Prussia's defeat, and making up about an annual pre-war budget of the government. In 1807 the East Prussian Estates made a political bargain on accepting the king as a member within their credit corporation with his royal East Prussian demesnes, to be encumbered as security for the Pfandbriefe to be issued in his favour, which he was to sell to investors, thus raising credit funds.
In return the estates reached a wider representation of further parts of the population by integrating the East Prussian free peasants, called Kölmer (holders of free estates according to Culm law) and forming a considerable group only in former Teutonic Prussia holding about a sixth of the arable East Prussian land, and non-noble manor estate holders, which had meanwhile acquired 10% of the feudal land mostly by eventual, but complicated and – subject to government authorisation – purchases of manor estates from over-indebted noble landlords. With representation in the estates they were also entitled to eventually raise credits, obliged to liability for credits of others, but simultaneously gained a say in the estates assembly.
On 9 October 1807 the Prussian Reform minister Heinrich vom und zum Stein prompted the king to decree the October Edict (Edict concerning the relieved possession and the free usage of real estate property as well as the personal relations of the rural population) which generally transformed all kind of landholdings into free allodial property. This act enormously increased the amount of alienable real estate in Prussia apt to be pledged as security for credits, needed so much to pay the higher taxes in order to finance Napoléon's warfare through the compulsory war contributions to France. Serfdom was thus also abolished. Most remaining legal differences between the estates (classes) were abolished in 1810, when almost all Prussian subjects – former feudal lords, serfs, burghers (city dwellers), free peasants, Huguenots etc., turned into citizens of Prussia, finally including also the last excepted group of the Jews in 1812.
When in 1813 the defeated and intimidated king, forced into a coalition with France since 1812, refrained to take his chance to shake off the French supremacy in the wake of Napoleon's defeats in Russia, the East Prussian estates stole a march on the king. On 23 January Count Friedrich Ferdinand Alexander zu Dohna-Schlobitten, president of the estates assembly, called its members for 5 February 1813.
After debating the appeal of Ludwig Yorck, illoyal and – therefore by Berlin – outlawed general of the Prussian corps within Napoléon's army, to form a liberation army, which was widely agreed, on February 7 the East Prussian estates unanimously voted for financing, recruiting and equipping a militia army (Landwehr) of 20,000 men, plus 10,000 in reserve, out of their funds following a proposal designed by Yorck, Clausewitz and Stein. The hesitant king could not stop this anymore, but only approve it on March 17.
However, this civic act of initiating Prussia's participation in the liberation wars was not thanked by the monarch, who again and again protracted his promise to introduce a parliament of genuine legislative competence for all the monarchy. Only in the wake of the Revolutions of 1848 Prussia received its first constitution providing for the Prussian Landtag as the parliament of the kingdom. It consisted of two chambers, the Herrenhaus (Prussian House of Lords) and the Abgeordnetenhaus (House of Representatives).
In 1899, the Prussian Landtag moved into a new building consisting of a complex of two structures, one for the House of Lords (now used by the Bundesrat) in Leipziger Straße and one for the House of Representatives in Prinz-Albrecht-Straße, today's Niederkirchnerstraße.
The House of Lords was reorganised and renamed into the Staatsrat (state council) of the Free State of Prussia after the abolition of the monarchy. Its members were representatives of the Provinces of Prussia. Konrad Adenauer used to be its long serving president.
Since 1993 the former House of Representatives is the seat of the Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin (House of Representatives of Berlin), and similar to the Reichstag, among Berliners it is still sometimes referred to colloquially as Preußischer Landtag.

Israel Policy Forum

The Israel Policy Forum (IPF) is a New York, NY based American Jewish organization that works for a negotiated two state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict though advocacy, education and policy research. The organization lobbies American policymakers in support of this goal and writes opinion pieces that have appeared in many Jewish and non-Jewish newspapers. It was founded in 1993.
The organization's president is Peter Joseph and its chair is Larry Zicklin. Its U.S. Advisory Council includes Thomas A. Dine, Marshall Breger and former Ambassadors Edward S. Walker, Jr. and Robert Pelletreau. Its Israel Advisory Council includes Ambassador Shimon Shamir, Gen. (Ret.) Iftach Spector and Yoram Yahav. Its program director and policy analyst was David Halperin.
Mission.
The stated mission of Israel Policy Forum (IPF) is to champion involved and continuous American diplomacy efforts, which it believes are imperative for reaching an overarching settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel Policy Forum believes that a two-state solution to the conflict will "safeguard Israel’s security and future as a Jewish and democratic state."
IPF was originally created as an offshoot of the Israel Labor Party. In 1997, it absorbed Project Nishma, a Washington-based organization that specialized in mobilizing Israeli military authorities who argued that the peace process was in Israel’s security interests.
Activities.
IPF’s team of advocates and leaders—which includes members of Jewish, philanthropic, academic and political organizations—imparts policy messages to American and international leaders. IPF also regularly holds conference calls and educational training in major U.S. cities.
IPF trains advocates to promote a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through educational programs. IPF holds an annual Leadership Event to support key figures who promote peacemaking efforts. Previous speakers at the Leadership Event include President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Senator Joseph Biden, Prime Minister Ehud Barak, then-Vice Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Vice Prime Minister Haim Ramon.
IPF works to enhance communication and diplomatic efforts between Israeli, Arab and American leaders. IPF arranges bi-annual delegations to the Middle East in which American leaders meet with heads-of-state, diplomats, scholars and analysts throughout the region. IPF also conducts media outreach by contributing background information and op-eds to major U.S. and Israeli publications.
Dispute over Freeman nomination.
Leaders of the Israel Policy Forum disagreed in early 2009 over the appointment of Charles Freeman to a senior US intelligence post. IPF Washington Director M.J. Rosenberg strongly supported Freeman on the grounds that Freeman's harsh criticisms of Israeli policy would make him an ideal candidate to prepare US intelligence estimates. However, the Jerusalem Post reported that the previous President of the IPF, Seymour D. Reich, stepped down from the forum's policy-making committee because he believed the appointee was "clearly biased against Israel" and stating "I don't see how he could have given any objective intelligence assessment on the Middle East with that baggage hanging out so openly."
Support for Hagel nomination.
In early January 2013 United States President Barack Obama nominated former United States Senator Chuck Hagel for United States Secretary of Defense. In a 2006 interview with Aaron David Miller Hagel had commented that "Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people [on Capitol Hill", and "I’m not an Israeli senator. I’m a United States senator." Several Jewish groups initially expressed hesitation. On January 23 the Israel Policy Forum published an ad in The Hill saying that the former Nebraska senator would “ably continue security cooperation between the United States and the State of Israel, which has reached unprecedented levels during President Obama’s time in office.” Among the 45 signatories were former ambassadors to Israel, former Congress members Mel Levine, Gary Ackerman and Robert Wexler, former White House official Stuart Eizenstat, Rabbi Sharon Brous, philanthropist Charles Bronfman and Thomas Dine, former executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
Criticism.
The IPF has been criticized by Isi Leibler, who called them "Jews against Zion", for promoting that Israel make "unilateral concessions to the Palestinians." Members of the IPF responded that Mr. Leibler's attack was "offensive and deplorable".

Desire

Desire is a sense of longing for a person or object or hoping for an outcome. The same sense is expressed by emotions such as "craving" or "hankering". When a person desires something or someone, their sense of longing is excited by the enjoyment or the thought of the item or person, and they want to take actions to obtain their goal. The motivational aspect of desire has long been noted by philosophers; Hobbes (1588–1679) asserted that human desire is the fundamental motivation of all human action.
In Hinduism, the Rig Veda's creation myth Nasadiya Sukta states regarding the one(ekam) spirit that "In the beginning there was Desire (kama) that was first seed of mind. Poets found the bond of being in non-being in their heart's thought".
In Buddhism, for an individual to effect his or her liberation, the flow of sense-desire must be cut completely; however, while training, he or she must work with motivational processes based on skilfully applied desire. The Buddha stated, according to the early Buddhist scriptures, that monks should "generate desire" for the sake of fostering skillful qualities and abandoning unskillful ones.
While desires are often classified as emotions by laypersons, psychologists often describe desires as different from emotions; psychologists tend to argue that desires arise from bodily structures, such as the stomach's need for food, whereas emotions arise from a person's mental state. Marketing and advertising companies have used psychological research on how desire is stimulated to find more effective ways to induce consumers to buy a given product or service.
While some advertising attempts to give buyers a sense of lack or wanting, other types of advertising create desire associating the product with desirable attributes, either by showing a celebrity or model with the product.
The theme of desire is at the core of the romance novel, which often create drama by showing cases where human desire is impeded by social conventions, class, or cultural barriers. As well, it is used in other literary genres, such as gothic novels such as "Dracula" by Bram Stoker, in which desire is mingled with fear and dread. Poets ranging from Homer to Toni Morrison have dealt with the themes of desire in their work. Just as desire is central to the written fiction genre of romance, it is the central theme of melodrama films, which use plots that appeal to the heightened emotions of the audience by showing "crises of human emotion, failed romance or friendship", in which desire is thwarted or unrequited.
In philosophy.
In philosophy, desire has been identified as a philosophical problem since Antiquity. Plato in "The Republic" argues that individual desires must be postponed in the name of the higher ideal.
Aristotle in "De Anima" claims that desire is implicated in animal interactions and the propensity of animals to motion; at the same time, he acknowledges that reasoning also interacts with desire.
Hobbes (1588–1679) proposed the concept of psychological hedonism, which asserts that the "fundamental motivation of all human action is the desire for pleasure." Spinoza (1632–1677) had a view which contrasted with Hobbes, in that "he saw natural desires as a form of bondage" that are not chosen by a person of their own free will. Hume (1711–1776)claimed that desires and passions are noncognitive, automatic bodily responses, and he argued that reasoning is "capable only of devising means to ends set by [bodily desire".
Kant (1724–1804) called any action based on desires a hypothetical imperative, meaning by this that it is a command of reason that applies only if one desires the goal in question.Kant also established a relation between the beautiful and pleasure in "Critique of Judgment". Hegel claimed that "self-consciousness is desire."
Because desire can cause humans to become obsessed and embittered, it has been called one of the causes of woe for mankind. Within the teachings of Buddhism, craving is thought to be the cause of all suffering that one experiences in human existence. The eradication of craving leads one to ultimate happiness, or Nirvana. Desire for wholesome things, though, is liberating and enhancing. While the stream of desire for sense-pleasures must be cut eventually, a practitioner on the path to liberation is encouraged by the Buddha to "generate desire" for the fostering of skillful qualities and the abandoning of unskillful ones.
Within the Christian faith, desire is seen as something that can either lead a person towards God and destiny or away from Him. Desire is not considered to be a bad thing in and of itself, rather it is a powerful force within the human that once submitted to the Lordship of Christ can become a tool for good, for advancement and for abundant living.
Scientific perspectives.
Psychology and neurology.
While desires are often classified as emotions by laypersons, psychologists often describe desires as different from emotions. For psychologists, desires arise from bodily structures, such as the stomach which needs food, the blood needs oxygen, and so on; on the other hand, emotions arise from a person's mental state. A 2008 study by the University of Michigan indicated that while humans experience desire and fear as psychological opposites, they share the same brain circuit. A 2008 study entitled "The Neural Correlates of Desire" showed that the human brain categorizes any stimulus according to its desirability by activating three different brain areas: the superior orbito-frontal, the mid-cingulate, and the anterior cingulate cortices.
While the "neuroscience of happiness and well-being is still in its infancy", research on the "distant cousins" of pleasure and desire show that reward is a key element in creating both of these states. Studies showed that a chemical called dopamine is the brain's "pleasure chemical". Research also shows that the orbitofrontal cortex has connections to both the opioid and dopamine systems, and stimulating this cortex is associated with subjective reports of pleasure.
Psychiatry.
Austrian psychiatrist Sigmund Freud, who is best known for his theories of the unconscious mind and the defense mechanism of repression and for creating the clinical practice of psychoanalysis, proposed the notion of the Oedipus Complex, which argues that desire for the mother creates neuroses in their sons. Freud used the Greek myth of Oedipus to argue that people desire incest and must repress that desire. He claimed that children pass through several stages, including a stage in which they fixated on the mother as a sexual object.
That this "complex" is universal has long since been disputed. Even if it were true, that would not explain those neuroses in daughters, but only in sons. While it is true that sexual confusion "can" be aberrative in a few cases, there is no credible evidence to suggest that it is a universal scenario. While Freud was correct in labeling the various symptoms behind most compulsions, phobias and disorders, he was largely incorrect in his theories regarding the etiology of what he identified.
French psychoanalyst and psychiatrist Jacques Lacan (1901–1981) argues that desire first occurs during a "mirror phase" of a baby's development, when the baby sees an image of wholeness in a mirror which gives them a desire for that being. As a person matures, Lacan claims that they still feel separated from themselves by language, which is incomplete, and so a person continually strives to become whole. He uses the term "jouissance" to refer to the lost object or feeling of absence which a person believes to be unobtainable. For more details on the Lacanian conception of desire, see desire (psychoanalysis)
In marketing.
In the field of marketing, desire is the human appetite for a given object of attention. Desire for a product is stimulated by advertising, which attempts to give buyers a sense of lack or wanting. In store retailing, merchants attempt to increase the desire of the buyer by showcasing the product attractively, in the case of clothes or jewellery, or, for food stores, by offering samples. With print, TV, and radio advertising, desire is created by giving the potential buyer a sense of lacking ("Are you still driving that old car?") or by associating the product with desirable attributes, either by showing a celebrity using or wearing the product, or by giving the product a "halo effect" by showing attractive models with the product. Nike's "Just Do It" ads for sports shoes are appealing to consumers' desires for self-betterment.
In some cases, the potential buyer already has the desire for the product before they enter the store, as in the case of a decorating buff entering their favorite furniture store. The role of the salespeople in these cases is simply to guide the customer towards making a choice; they do not have to try to "sell" the general idea of making a purchase, because the customer already wants the products. In other cases, the potential buyer does not have a desire for the product or service, and so the company has to create the sense of desire. An example of this situation is for life insurance. Most young adults are not thinking about dying, so they are not naturally thinking about how they need to have accidental death insurance. Life insurance companies, though, have managed to create a desire for life insurance with advertising that shows pictures of children and asks "If anything happens to you, who will pay for the children's upkeep?".
Another example is personal hygiene products, such as anti-dandruff shampoo and mouthwash. Prior to the introduction of commercials advertising anti-dandruff shampoo or mouthwash, it is unlikely that consumers had an intrinsic desire to use these products. However, after seeing commercials depicting the social undesirability of flakes on the shoulder, or of bad breath, it created a desire to resolve these fears. Marketing theorists call desire the third stage in the hierarchy of effects, which occurs when the buyer develops a sense that if they felt the need for the type of product in question, the advertised product is what would quench their desire.
In fiction, film, and art.
Fiction.
The theme of desire is at the core of the romance novel. Novels which are based around the theme of desire, which can range from a long aching feeling to an unstoppable torrent, include "Madame Bovary" by Gustave Flaubert; "Love in the Time of Cholera" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez; the sensual, yet controversial novel "Lolita" by Vladimir Nabokov; "Jane Eyre" by Charlotte Brontë, and "Dracula" by Bram Stoker. Brontë's characterization of Jane Eyre depicts her as torn by an inner conflict between reason and desire, because "customs" and "conventionalities" stand in the way of her romantic desires. E.M. Forster's novels use homoerotic codes to describe same-sex desire and longing. Close male friendships with subtle homoerotic undercurrents occur in every novel, which subverts the conventional, heterosexual plot of the novels. In the gothic-themed "Dracula", Stoker depicts the theme of desire which is coupled with fear. When the Lucy character is seduced by Dracula, she describes her sensations in the graveyard as a mixture of fear and blissful emotion.
Poet W.B. Yeats depicts the positive and negative aspects of desire in his poems such as "The Rose for the World," "Adam’s Curse," "No Second Troy," "All Things can Tempt me," and "Meditations in Time of Civil War" . Some poems depict desire as a poison for the soul; Yeats worked through his desire for his beloved, Maud Gonne, and realized that "Our longing, our craving, our thirsting for something other than Reality is what dissatisfies us". In "The Rose for the World," he admires her beauty, but feels pain because he cannot be with her. In the poem "No Second Troy," Yeats overflows with anger and bitterness because of their unrequited love. Poet T. S. Eliot dealt with the themes of desire and homoeroticism in his poetry, prose and drama. Other poems on the theme of desire include John Donne's poem "To His Mistress Going to Bed", Carol Ann Duffy's longings in "Warming Her Pearls; Ted Hughes' "Lovesong" about the savage intensity of desire; and Wendy Cope's humorous poem "Song".
Philippe Borgeaud's novels analyse how emotions such as erotic desire and seduction are connected to fear and wrath by examining cases where people are worried about issues of impurity, sin, and shame.
Film.
Just as desire is central to the written fiction genre of romance, it is the central theme of melodrama films, which are a subgenre of the drama film. Like drama, a melodrama depends mostly on in-depth character development, interaction, and highly emotional themes. Melodramatic films tend to use plots that appeal to the heightened emotions of the audience. Melodramatic plots often deal with "crises of human emotion, failed romance or friendship, strained familial situations, tragedy, illness, neuroses, or emotional and physical hardship." Film critics sometimes use the term "pejoratively to connote an unrealistic, bathos-filled, campy tale of romance or domestic situations with stereotypical characters (often including a central female character) that would directly appeal to feminine audiences." Also called "women's movies", "weepies", tearjerkers, or "chick flicks".
"Melodrama…is Hollywood’s fairly consistent way of treating desire and subject identity", as can be seen in well-known films such as "Gone with the Wind", in which "desire is the driving force for both Scarlett and the hero, Rhett". Scarlett desires love, money, the attention of men, and the vision of being a virtuous "true lady". Rhett Butler desires to be with Scarlett, which builds to a burning longing that is ultimately his undoing, because Scarlett keeps refuses his advances; when she finally confesses her secret desire, Rhett is worn out and his longing is spent.
In Cathy Cupitt's article on "Desire and Vision in Blade Runner", she argues that film, as a "visual narrative form, plays with the voyeuristic desires of its audience". Focusing on the dystopian 1980s science fiction film "Blade Runner", she calls the film an "Object of Visual Desire", in which it plays to an "expectation of an audience's delight in visual texture, with the 'retro-fitted' spectacle of the post-modern city to ogle" and with the use of the "motif of the 'eye'". In the film, "desire is a key motivating influence on the narrative of the film, both in the 'real world', and within the text."
Contemporary Spiritual Perspective.
Barry Long defined desire as stress or strain. It is a tension between you and the thing or state you desire. As the thing does not feel this stress, the desiring is a one-way tension within you, an apparent reaching out towards the object or person.
When the person responds in the way desired, or the object is attained, the desire settles down into a relationship. A relationship is identifiable by the presence of an attitude in yourself which reacts in terms of 'mine'.
The strength of a relationship cannot be known until after it is broken. Then the original desire reappears, modified by experience. It continues to be modified by repetition of experience until eventually it vanishes. Unsuspected by the long-suffering desirer, its final stage is usually a shadow-existence of thinking and going back over the past, powered by nothing more than habit. Every habit is a track left by desire.
Desire itself can only be eliminated by desiring, and that always results one way or another in pain for the desirer. Living is just that: ceaseless desire eliminating and reforming itself by the pain and frustration of its own wanting.
When a desire has been reduced to the level of a habit or idea it can be dealt with and eliminated fairly quickly by observation - seeing it for what it is. In that moment you suddenly realise you are free of the relationship as a need or dependence 'of mine'.

John C. Jacobs

John C. Jacobs (December 16, 1838 Lancaster County, Pennsylvania - September 22, 1894 Atlantic City, Atlantic County, New Jersey) was an American politician from New York.
Life.
In 1857, he became a reporter for the "New York Express", was the paper's correspondent in Albany, New York, and was its war correspondent, accompanying the Peninsular Campaign. In 1865, he transferred to the "New York World".
He was a Democratic member of the New York State Assembly (Kings Co., 9th D.) in 1867, 1868, 1869, 1870, 1871, 1872 and 1873. He was Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, participated in the corrupt proceedings of the Tweed Ring, and received bribes, for example a check for 2200 USD in June 1870.
He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1874 to 1885, sitting in the 97th, 98th, 99th, 100th, 101st, 102nd, 103rd, 104th, 105th, 106th, 107th and 108th New York State Legislatures. He was a delegate to the 1876 Democratic National Convention.
He was Chairman of the Democratic state convention in 1879, and was proposed as a compromise candidate for Governor, attempting to unite the Democratic Party which was split into factions led by Gov. Lucius Robinson and Tammany leader John Kelly. The Tammany followers had him nominated "by acclamation", but Jacobs declined. Later Robinson was nominated by the Democrats, and Kelly ran as an Independent, leading to the election of Republican Alonzo B. Cornell with less votes than Robinson and Kelly together. 
In 1882, the Democrats achieved a small majority in the State Senate which had 17 Democratic and 15 Republican members. On January 2, 14 of the Democratic senators met in caucus and nominated Jacobs for President pro tem. The other three senators were absent, following instructions from Tammany Hall leader John Kelly, who objected to Jacobs. On January 3, the State Senate convened and, on motion of Jacobs, suspended Rule 3 which gave the Lieutenant Governor the right to appoint the standing committees. Thereafter, the elections of the Clerk and the President pro tempore of the State Senate were deadlocked, with the majority of the Democrats holding on to Jacobs, the Tammany men voting for John G. Boyd, and the Republicans for Dennis McCarthy. Thus the senate could not be organized, although the Lieutenant Governor presided, but after the suspension of Rule 3 no committees could be appointed, and all legislative work was blocked. The deadlock was broken on February 15 when the Republicans and the Tammany men voted to restore Rule 3, and rumors of a bargain appeared. On February 20, John W. Vrooman, the Republican Clerk of the previous year, was re-elected by the Republicans and the Tammany men. On February 21, Lt. Gov. George G. Hoskins announced the members of the committees, giving 5 out of 15 chairmanships to the three Tammany men, and no President pro tempore was chosen for this session.
On January 11, 1883, Jacobs was elected President pro tempore of the State Senate for the 106th Session.
On October 20, 1886, he married Rosalia Marie Sanger. He was again a member of the State Senate (2nd D.) in 1890 and 1891. 
In 1892 he removed to Atlantic City, NJ, because of his failing health, and died there from Bright's disease.
After his death, it was alleged that 17-year-old William Warren was his son with an unknown mother.

1992 Major League Baseball Draft

The 1992 Major League Baseball Draft took place on June 1, 1992, through a conference call involving all 28 MLB teams of the time. Phil Nevin of Cal State Fullerton was the first overall selection, chosen by the Houston Astros. Derek Jeter, widely considered a future member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, was selected by the New York Yankees with the sixth selection. In addition to Nevin, Paul Shuey, B. J. Wallace, Jeffrey Hammonds, and Chad Mottola were selected ahead of Jeter.
First-round selections.
The 1993 expansion Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins participated in the MLB Draft for the first time in 1992.
With the first overall selections of the previous two drafts, Chipper Jones and Brien Taylor, receiving signing bonuses of $1.2 million ($ in current dollar terms) and $1.55 million ($ in current dollar terms) respectively, salary demands of new players became a factor in the 1992 draft. Prior to the draft, Jeffrey Hammonds of the Stanford Cardinal baseball team sought a signing bonus of $1.8 million ($ in current dollar terms). Derek Jeter, a high school player who had a commitment to play college baseball at the University of Michigan, was believed to be seeking a bonus of at least $1 million ($ in current dollar terms) to forego college.
The Astros, holding the first overall selection, were keenly aware of the bonus demands of Hammonds and Jeter, as they were unable to sign their first-round pick in the 1991 MLB Draft, John Burke, who held out for a bonus of $500,000 ($ in current dollar terms) as the sixth overall selection. They selected Phil Nevin, the 1992 College World Series Most Outstanding Player, with the first overall selection. In addition to perceiving Nevin as close to MLB-ready, needing little development in minor league baseball, Nevin also did not seek a large signing bonus. He agreed to sign with the Astros for $700,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Astros' scout Hal Newhouser quit in protest, as he had insisted to Astros' management that they should choose Jeter.
The teams with the first four selections, the Astros, Cleveland Indians, Montreal Expos, and Baltimore Orioles, had the four lowest payrolls in MLB. The Cleveland Indians selected Paul Shuey out of the University of North Carolina with the second selection, who they projected could develop into a closer comparable to Rob Dibble. The Expos, who preferred Hammonds, drafted B. J. Wallace instead, as they were unable to afford Hammonds' salary demands. The Orioles selected Hammonds with the fourth overall selection; he signed with the Orioles for $975,000 ($ in current dollar terms), the largest signing bonus given out in the 1992 Draft. With the fifth pick, the Reds chose Chad Mottola from the University of Central Florida (UCF), making Mottola the first UCF athlete to be chosen in the first round of a professional sports draft. He signed with the Reds the day of the draft for $400,000 ($ in current dollar terms). 
Yankees scout Dick Grouch, assigned to scout in the Midwest, watched Jeter participate in an all-star camp held at Western Michigan University, and came away sold by Jeter's talent. Though the Yankees were also concerned that Jeter might attend college, Grouch convinced the team to select Jeter. Regarding the possibility Jeter would attend Michigan, Grouch said "the only place Derek Jeter's going is to Cooperstown", referring to the home city of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Jeter signed with the Yankees for $800,000 ($ in current dollar terms).
Scott Boras advised Charles Johnson and Michael Tucker. Those players fell in the first round as their perceived salary demands were too high for many teams.

<doc id="19361757" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19361757" title="Armbinder">
Armbinder

An armbinder is a type of restraint devices primarily used in bondage play (rather than law enforcement, medicine, or psychiatry), designed to bind the arms and/or hands to each other or to the body, usually behind the back, and employing a range of bondage equipment including cuffs, rods, straps, and gloves.
One type of armbinder is the monoglove.
Single glove sheath.
A common form of armbinder consists of a sheath, roughly conical, that encloses both of the wearer's arms from fingertips to above the elbow, holding them together behind the back, combined with one of various harness (straps) arrangements to hold it in place. The sheath is commonly of latex or leather which itself typically covers the arms from the fingertips to above the elbows, and is closed and tightened with a zipper, lacing, or sometimes both; the sheath is frequently supplemented with straps around the wrists and the elbows or upper arms. The sheath alone is ineffective without a harness to keep it from slipping down the arms; the most common harness is a pair of straps that join to the outer top of the sheath, run over the shoulders and under the armpits, and join again at the inner top of the sheath. The straps are usually crossed, behind the neck or across the upper chest, to prevent the straps from slipping off the shoulders. The latter position can cause problems if the straps tend to ride up and press on the wearer's throat. Left strap is brought from under left armpit, brought over right shoulder and then buckled up behind the neck . same is done with right strap and then both right and left strap are buckled together to prevent falling of armbinder. Due to this armbinder, elbows are kept in touch with each other for a long time which can cause injury if kept for a very long time.
Monoglove variation.
The John Willie style of monoglove used a different method of securing the Armbinder to the upper body, diverging from the common method of shoulder straps across the chest. Instead, a Y-shaped yoke would run up the back, fork over the shoulders, and run under the armpits; with an optional addition of a strap or chain running up the back from the Y-shaped yoke to a collar around the neck. The fingertip end of the monoglove was frequently provided with a D-ring, allowing the bound arms to be anchored into a hogtie or strappado position, or to be strapped to the front of a waist belt (forcing the hands into the crotch).
Construction materials.
Monogloves are usually made of thin Garment leather or latex, though other fetish materials, such as spandex or rubber, are commonly used; monogloves of denim, camouflage twill, reinforced satin, and other strong fabrics exist. Closes can utilize lacing with eyelets, zippers, straps with buckles, or combinations of all three. Some variations also utilize buckles that can have a lock inserted for additional security.
Cuffs, rods and straps.
Another form of an armbinder consists of the use of cuffs and straps to hold the arms to the side of the body, or in front or back of the body. A series of cuffs, which can be made from various material such as leather or metal, are placed on the arms at various points such as the wrists and elbows. These cuffs are then linked together with a webbing of straps, or a series of rods, to hold the arms in a particular position. To improve strength, as well as ease of use, all the cuffs and straps are typically linked together, hence why the complete piece of equipment is considered an armbinder. Another form uses a single rod, with the cuffs attached at regular distances down its length, and sometimes also including a collar at the top to hold the rod in place.
Safety issues and visual appeal.
Because of the extreme position into which the arms are sometimes forced, many armbinders, and especially monogloves, can cause problems with the soft tissues of the shoulder joints and with the circulation and innervation of the arms and hands. Only the most flexible people can wear them for any length of time;
thus they are more often used for dramatic or visual effect in bondage erotica than in actual BDSM play. But for those who are able to tolerate having their arms pressed so tightly together behind their back that their elbows touch or nearly touch, the evenly-distributed pressure of the monoglove maintains this extreme position with far less discomfort, and far less likelihood of injury, than do ropes. (For this property it was singled out for mention in the widely read 1972 manual "The Joy of Sex", well before the "mainstreaming" of BDSM imagery. A 1970 scholarly study had already noted the great frequency with which this "appliance" figures in fetish literature and imagery, and pointed out its tendency to enhance the female figure.) Nevertheless, great caution should always be exercised when using one, to avoid dislocation of the shoulders and damage to nerves and blood vessels.
There are several variations on the basic monoglove design, including single sleeves ending at the wrists (allowing some freedom of movement for the wearer's hands), and those that are incorporated into a larger garment, such as a jacket, catsuit, or dress, taking the place of the garment's usual sleeves.

Deaf education

Deaf education is the education of students with various hearing levels in a way that addresses the students' individual differences and needs. Ideally, this process involves the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of teaching procedures, adapted equipment and materials, accessible settings, and other interventions designed to help learners of various hearing levels achieve a higher level of personal self-sufficiency, and success in school and community than would be available if the students were only given access to a typical classroom education. Many countries focus on training teachers on how to teach deaf students, take many approaches to achieve the expected level of education, and build associations to protect deaf students.
Identifying deaf students.
Some children can be easily identified as candidates of deaf education from their audiogram or medical history. 
Individual needs.
Deaf education programs should be customized to address each student's unique needs. Deaf educators provide a continuum of services, in which deaf students receive in varying degrees based on their individual needs. It is essential for deaf education programs to be individualized to address the unique combination of needs for each student.
In the United States, Canada, and the UK, educational professionals used the initialism IEP when referring to a student’s individualized education plan.
Methods of provision.
Schools use different approaches to provide deaf educational services to identified students. These can be broadly grouped into four categories, according to whether and how much contact the deaf student has with non-deaf students (using North American terminology):
Instructional strategies.
There are some specialized instruction strategies used to teach deaf children.
Bilingual-bicultural education.
In this educational method, deafness is not seen as a medical issue; it is instead seen as a cultural issue. In the bilingual-bicultural program, it is advocated that children who are deaf are taught ASL as a first language, then taught written and/or spoken English as a second language. Bilingual-bicultural programs emphasize that English and ASL are equal languages, and they work to help children develop age-appropriate levels of fluency in both languages. The bilingual-bicultural approach holds the belief that deaf children are visual learners as opposed to auditory learners. Therefore, classes should be conducted in a complete visual language. Since American Sign Language and spoken English cannot be used simultaneously for fear of harming the accuracy and fluency of both languages, American Sign Language alone with no oral language, or voice-off ASL, is usually used. Many bilingual-bicultural schools have dormitories, and students can either commute to school every day or stay in a dormitory as part of the residential program and visit their families on weekends and/or holidays and school vacations.
Auditory-oral and auditory-verbal education.
The auditory-oral and auditory-verbal methods, sometimes referred to collectively as listening and spoken language, are forms of oral education. These methods are based on the belief that a deaf child can learn to listen and speak so that his/her families do not need to learn sign language or cued speech. These methods are presented as communication options, and they rely on a large amount of parental involvement. Children who use this option may be placed in a continuum of educational placements including oral schools, such as Clarke Schools for Hearing and Speech, self-contained classrooms for deaf students in public schools, or mainstream classrooms with hearing students.
Mainstreaming and inclusion.
Under this educational method, a deaf child attends public school in regular classes for at least part of the school day. Students may receive accommodations such as itinerant teachers, interpreters, assistive technology, notetakers, and aides. The benefits of inclusion include daily interaction with hearing students and the opportunity to live at home, but the drawbacks include isolation and limited availability of support.
History of deaf education.
John Bulwer, an English physician,
He was the first person in England to propose educating deaf people,
France.
Charles-Michel de l'Épée pioneered deaf education in France. He was involved in charitable work for the poor, and, on one foray into the slums of Paris, he had a chance to encounter with two young deaf sisters who communicated using a sign language. Épée decided to dedicate himself to the education and salvation of the deaf. In 1760, he founded a school. In line with emerging philosophical thought of that time, Épée came to believe that deaf people were capable of language and concluded that they should be able to receive the sacraments and thus avoid going to hell. He began to develop a system of instruction of the French language and religion. In the early 1760s, his shelter became the world's first free school for the deaf, open to the public.
Great Britain.
At the same time the first school set up for the purpose of teaching the deaf to speak and read in Britain was Thomas Braidwood's Academy for the Deaf and Dumb in Edinburgh established in 1760s. The school moved to London in 1783 and was called the "Asylum for the Support and Education of the Deaf and Dumb Children of the Poor". Braidwood used an early form of sign language, the combined system, which was the forerunner of British Sign Language, recognized as a language in its own right in 2003. Braidwood's combined system that he pioneered is known among British Deaf historians as the Braidwoodian Method.
Under the management of Braidwood's nephew, the school ran successfully and soon expanded its premises. The example of this school stimulated the establishment of many others: an Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb opened in Edgbaston in 1814 followed by others across the country - Liverpool, Edinburgh, Exeter, Manchester and Doncaster.
United States.
Deaf education in the United States began in the early 1800s, when the Cobbs School, an oral school, was established by William Bolling and John Braidwood, and the Connecticut Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, a manual school, was established by Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet and Laurent Clerc. When the Cobbs School closed in 1816, the manual method, which used American Sign Language, became commonplace in deaf schools for most of the remainder of the century. In the late 1800s, schools began to use the oral method, which only allowed the use of speech, as opposed to the manual method previously in place. Students caught using sign language in oral programs were often punished. The oral method was used for many years until sign language instruction gradually began to come back into deaf education.
Issues.
People often advocate for one of two broad categories in deaf education: manualism or oralism. Manualism is the education of deaf students using sign language and oralism is the education of deaf students using oral language. Since the beginning of the 18th century, these two philosophies have been on opposing sides of a heated debate that continues to this day, although many modern deaf educational facilities attempt to integrate both approaches. The National Association of the Deaf advocates for a bilingual approach to best support deaf students in their education.
National approaches.
North America.
In North America, deaf education is commonly denoted as "DeafEd" in a professional context.
United States.
All deaf students receive an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that outlines how the school will meet the student's individual needs. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires that students with special needs are provided with a Free Appropriate Public Education in the Least Restrictive Environment that is appropriate to the student's needs. Government-run schools provide deaf education in varying degrees from the least restrictive settings, such as full inclusion, to the most restrictive settings, such as segregation in a deaf school. The education offered by the school must be appropriate to the student's individual needs. Schools are not required to maximize the student's potential or to provide the best possible services. Like most of the developed countries, American schools are also required to provide many medical services, such as speech therapy, if the student needs these services.
Asia.
Nepal.
Under law currently being enacted, deaf children in Nepal have the right to have free, qualified education in line with the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). As yet, however, education in a school for the deaf is limited to some 13 dedicated schools for the deaf plus a slightly greater number of deaf resource classes located in regular schools. Theoretically, all these schools and classes are bilingual, with Nepali Sign Language and written Nepali being the medium of instruction. In practice, limited number of Deaf teachers and the minimal training hearing teachers are given in Nepali Sign Language, much of the instruction in these schools is via a pidginized form of Nepali Sign Language commonly referred to as Sign-Supported Nepali, and the teaching methodology tends towards some version of the Simultaneous Communication variety of Total Communication.
Teacher training.
Deaf education majors and degree programs offer training and certification in the education of students with various hearing capabilities in a way that addresses the students' individual differences and needs. Deaf education also includes the study of special education, Deaf studies, education. sign language and Deaf culture (not all programs include the study of the latter two).

Josef Bulva

Josef Bulva (January 9, 1943 in Brno, in the province of Moravia, Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic) is a Czech pianist who began his training at the age of nine at the music school of Napajedla, and at the age of thirteen gave his first concerts playing works by Mozart, études by Liszt and the “Paganini Variations” by Brahms. He was excused from conventional education and entered the conservatory in Brno with a state scholarship and then went on to the Music Academy in Bratislava (where Lucia Popp and Editha Gruberova also studied), where he graduated with honors. Soon after, at twenty-one, he was promoted as an “artist of the State”.
The subsequent intense concert activities of the pianist in many countries were abruptly interrupted in 1971 for an entire year by a serious accident. His immigration to the West due to political reasons followed, and he took residence first in Munich and then in Luxembourg, where he resumed his concert and recording activities.
In 1996 another accident injured his left hand in a way which was considered at the time to be permanent, and forced him to end his career as a professional pianist. Since that time he has lived in Monaco.
However, contrary to all expectations, the injury healed over the years and thus Bulva was able after a pause of 13 years, to give in November and December 2009 various highly acclaimed concerts in Augsburg, Munich, Zurich and Stuttgart.
Bulva’s rich repertoire contains, among others, works by Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Liszt, Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, Scriabin, Rachmaninov and contemporary composers. In certain cases he made his own arrangements of existing compositions, as in the case of Liszt’s “Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2” and Wagner’s Overture to “Tannhäuser”.
Bulva has always refused to give himself in to modern marketing and packaging and to thus become a mainstream pianist, and his playing has not been free of controversy. Whereas Joachim Kaiser, the doyen of European music critics, once called him “the pianist of the scientific age” under whose hands “masterpieces appear in a new light” and the Steinway Owners' Magazine stated that “he mirrors much of the credo of Steinway & Sons”, others criticized a certain analytic distance and lack of “romanticism”, the latter particularly in his interpretation of the music of Chopin. However, all have been united in praising his legendary pianistic qualities, his extraordinary virtuosity and bravura as well as his profound insight and musicality. To this extent, Josef Bulva has been, to say the least, “the pianists’ pianist” of his generation.
Recordings.
Bulva has made many recordings with labels such as TELDEC, RCA, ORFEO and MEDIAPHON-MADACY, parts of which are still available. Among them are:
Recently, the OREIKON label published “The Art of Josef Bulva”, containing on 7 CDs an authorized legacy of the pianist. The main works on this edition are:

Liu Jindong () (December 9, 1981 in Qingdao, Shandong) is a Chinese international football player who currently plays for Shandong Luneng in the Chinese Super League as a versatile player who is capable of playing in defense or midfield. With Shandong Luneng he has won several domestic league and cup trophies with them before becoming the teams captain at the start of the 2010 league season where he would go on to lead the team to the league title.
Club career.
Liu Jindong started his professional football career in 2001 for Shandong Luneng after he graduated from their youth team. In his first season for Shandong he was able to play in seven games before establishing himself the following season where he played a further nineteen games. Due to his versatility he has been able to establish himself as a regular member of the team since and has helped Shandong win the 2006 and 2008 league titles. By the 2009 league season he would settle within defense and was given the vice-captaincy role within the club, however the teams captain Shu Chang would suffer several long term injury problems throughout season and Liu Jindong spent the majority as the teams captain. When new manager Branko Ivanković arrived at the club at the beginning of the 2010 league season he decided to make Liu his permanent captain and this seemed to have work as Shandong would go on to win the league title at the end of season.
International career.
Due to his consistent regular appearneces for Shandong Luneng in 2003 he received a call up to the senior national team, making his debut against Chile in a 0-0 friendly match draw on August 20, 2003 where he played in midfield. Under Chinese manager Arie Haan, Liu Jindong was able to gain regular playing time for the national team and would even score his first international goal on December 11, 2003 in an East Asian Cup game vs Hong Kong. Despite playing in several friendlies leading up to the 2004 AFC Asian Cup he was not picked in the final squad to play in the tournament, with Zhou Haibin preferred.
When Arie Haan left the Chinese team his replacement Zhu Guanghu completely left Liu Jindong out of all of his squads and this was to continue under Vladimir Petrović. Liu Jindong would have to wait five years until Gao Hongbo came in before he made his return in a friendly match against Germany in a 1-1 draw on May 29, 2009. He would continue to re-establish himself when he played in another friendly against Saudi Arabia in another friendly match, which China lost 4-1 on June 4, 2009.

Stanislas (singer)

Louis Stanislas Renoult (born on 29 May 1972, in Fontainebleau, Seine-et-Marne), just known as Stanislas, is a French singer. After several musical collaborations since 2000, he met success in 2008 with his first solo album "L'Équilibre instable".
Biography.
He is the son of François Renoult, a musician who had worked with Antoine, notably on the song "Je l'appelle Canelle".
Stanislas entered the Conducting program at the École Normale de Musique de Paris when he was 19. Three years later, he left the school with honors and became the assistant of musical director of the Orchestra of Massy Dominique Rouits where he regularly continues to direct classical works. He also composed, works on arrangements and produced many pop singles for artists such as Daniel Levi, Calogero (with whom he recorded a duet), Charles Aznavour, Maurane, Kool Shen, Céline Dion. 
In 2000, Stanislas formed with Gioacchino (Calogero's brother) the band Pure Orchestra and signed with Atletico Records, the label of Pascal Obispo. Their first single "U&I" was aired on radio in summer 2001 and the album "Singing’ dog" was released in February 2002. In 2004, Stanislas began to wrote his first solo album et decided to start a new collaboration with his brother Thibaud. They recorded Thibaud's first studio album, entitled "Les Pas perdus", then Stanislas' debut album "L'Équilibre instable" released in late 2007 (Polydor/Universal). His first single "Le Manège" achieved success in France. It was followed by "La Belle de Mai", then by "La débâcle des sentiments", a duet with Calogero.
After a great success of his two concerts at the Alambra of Paris in March 2008, Stanislas was on stage in France and Belgium in November and December 2008 (Massy, Lille, Nantes, Tours, the Olympia of Paris, Ludres, Aix-en-Provence, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Troyes, Brussels, Sanary, Lyon).
He revealed that he first wanted to participate as a contestant in the French version of Star Academy. A fourth single off the album was released, "Les lignes de ma main" in March 2009.
Stanislas was nominated at the 2009 NRJ Music Awards in the categories 'French group/duet of the year' and 'Music video of the year' for his single "La débâcle des sentiments", but didn't win.

However in 2001 the band Flying Virgins were put together with Peter Sørensen on drums and soon following Jens Back on Bass and Jonas Qvesel on keys.
Flying Virgins existed in the period 2001-2005 where a record was made: Your Spectacular Light and the EP Lazy Star one of the first free EP's distributed on the internet as MP3 and FLAC. In the period of Flying Virgins the band toured in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.
A change of setup and members happened as well in 2005, where Late Night Venture was formed in their now known form. Filip left the band and after a period as a quartet, Peter Olsen joined on guitars and vocals.
Late Night Venture released their selftitled debut in 2006, produced by Jonas Jørgensen (Figurines, The Defectors) to high acclaim in reviews around Europe. Late Night Venture toured a lot in Denmark, Germany and UK in that period, and the record got lot of attention both in Denmark and outside.
During 2008 LNV developed there style into an even more epic, atmospheric and heavier sound allowing the band to focus on their strong side: the journeys into hypnotic soundscapes. The first result of this can be heard on the bands forthcoming EP produced in Collaboration with Cult of Luna drummer/producer Magnus Lindberg, in the Tornado studios, Copenhagen making 4 epic songs which really opened the doors to where they are now.
After the recording session and a European tour in the summer of 2008 through Denmark, Germany, France, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Czech republic. The band is now back in the rehearsingroom writing new material and preparing themselves for new roadtrips!

You're Telling Me!

"You're Telling Me!" is a 1934 comedy film released by Paramount Pictures, and starring W. C. Fields; this film is a remake of his earlier silent film "So's Your Old Man" (1926), and both films are adapted from the story "Mr. Bisbee’s Princess" by Julian Leonard Street.
Synopsis.
Sam Bisbee (W. C. Fields) is an optometrist and an amateur inventor. His daughter Pauline (Joan Marsh) is in love with Bob Murchison (Buster Crabbe), but Bob's upper-class mother (Kathleen Howard) wants nothing to do with anyone related to uncouth Sam Bisbee. Even Sam's wife Bessie (Louise Carter) is ashamed of him, because he prefers to be himself rather than put on airs. Pauline is the one woman who truly loves Sam, accepting her father as he is.
Sam receives a letter from the National Tire Company expressing interest in one of his inventions, puncture-proof tires that can resist bullets. He goes in his car, which is fitted with four of his tires, and offers to give a demonstration by shooting at the tires; while he was in the boardroom, however, his car had been towed and a similar-looking police car is now in its place. The tires (naturally) fail to resist Sam's bullets, and the police chase after him.
During the train trip home, feeling that he's failed completely, Sam contemplates committing suicide by drinking a bottle of iodine, but decides against it at the last minute. While on the train, he meets a woman (Adrienne Ames) who has a bottle of iodine in front of her; believing (wrongly) that she was also thinking of committing suicide, Sam proceeds to "talk her out of it" by telling her about his own troubles. This scene is played mostly "straight" by Fields, minus the usual visual shtick and blustery persona. Unknown to Sam, the woman is Princess Lescaboura, a royal visitor to the United States; moved by Sam's story, she secretly decides to help him.
The next day, Sam's home town is surprised to hear that they will be receiving a visit from Princess Lescaboura; when the princess arrives, she says that she is there specifically to see Sam Bisbee, who had once saved her life. As a result, everyone starts treating Sam with respect, including Mrs. Murchison. Sam, who thinks the whole thing is a sham cooked up by the "princess", quietly congratulates her on it.
The story's climax occurs at a golf course the city is opening, and Bisbee is given the honor of driving the first ball off the tee. This gives Fields a chance to reprise the routine that formed the nucleus of his earlier short film, "The Golf Specialist". He deals with all manner of annoyances and distractions, while repeatedly exhorting the caddy (Tammany Young), and the Princess, to "stand clear and keep your eye on the ball!"
With Fields still at the tee, the president of the National Tire Company, Robbins (George Irving), arrives at the course. The company had found Sam's car and tested the tires themselves, and they want to do business with him. Robbins initially offers him $20,000, but the princess says that she wants the patent for her own country. The princess bids Robbins up until the flustered Robbins finally raises his offer to $1,000,000 and a royalty on every tire; Sam accepts.
Now that his family is wealthy and respected, and with his daughter Pauline married to Bob, all is well with Sam, who never does realize that the Princess really was a princess. As she is about to drive away, Sam congratulates her on "putting one over" on everyone. She just smiles and says, "You're telling "me!"" Fields then walks off contentedly.
Notes.
The triumph of Fields' character over his circumstances, and the happy ending thanks to a windfall profit, would be repeated later in 1934, in "It's a Gift".
This film was given only a cursory review in William K. Everson's "The Art of W. C. Fields" (Bonanza Books, 1967, p. 107-110) as the film was then unavailable due to ownership issues. Those issues were eventually resolved, and the film is included in the Universal DVD set, "W. C. Fields Comedy Collection, Volume Two".
As Everson points out (p. 115), the minor character called "Charlie Bogle" would be adopted as Fields' writing pseudonym for several of his films following this one.

Christian Ludwig von Kalckstein

Christian Ludwig von Kalckstein (1630 – 8 November 1672) was a Prussian count, Colonel, and politician who was executed for treason.
Biography.
Kalckstein was the son of Count Albrecht von Kalckstein, a strong critic of Frederick William, Elector and Duke of Brandenburg-Prussia. During his youth Kalckstein had served in the French army under Turenne, but was dismissed as being disorderly. He entered the Polish army in 1654, but fought for Duke Frederick William at the 1656 Battle of Warsaw, for which he was rewarded with a captaincy in the district of Oletzko. In 1659 the duke dismissed Kalckstein after the clerk of Oletzko accused the young noble of embezzlement and maltreatment of his subjects.
The Kalckstein family were staunch defenders of the Prussian estates and opposed the centralizing absolutism of Frederick William; Prussia had been a fief of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth until Frederick William achieved sovereignty in the 1660 Treaty of Oliva. After being dismissed from Oletzko, Kalckstein reentered the Polish army and plotted against Frederick William from the Polish capital, Warsaw. After Albrecht's 1667 death, his sons disputed the inheritance; Christian Ludwig was accused by his siblings of conspiring to murder Frederick William and invite Polish troops into Prussia. Although his siblings' evidence was dubious, Kalckstein contrived the idea of asking his servants to perjure on his behalf in the case. When this was found out, Kalckstein was convicted of "lèse majesté" and sentenced to life imprisonment. Upon the arrival of the duke in the Prussian capital, Königsberg, the following year, Kalckstein begged for mercy and had his sentence reduced to a fine and exile to his estate.
In March 1670 the Junker fled by sledge to Warsaw to present a protest to the Sejm of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as the self-appointed representative of the Prussian estates.
Frederick William was alarmed that the rebellious Kalckstein would inspire opposition in the estates, which met in July 1670 to discuss the duke's requests for funds for his army. When King Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki of Poland refused to extradite Kalckstein, Frederick William ordered his diplomat in Warsaw, Eusebius von Brandt, to capture Kalckstein. Brandt had the noble secretly bundled in a carpet and returned to Prussia at the end of 1670.
Frederick William disregarded Michał's objections, accurately predicting the Polish king would not make "an elephant out of a gnat". In order to make an example for the Prussian estates, the duke had Kalckstein tried in 1671 by a special court consisting mostly of non-Prussians. The prisoner was also tortured in order to reveal his accomplices. Kalckstein was sentenced to death in January 1672 and beheaded at Memel on 8 November 1672. The execution of Kalckstein, the only political execution during Frederick William's reign, contributed to the submission of the estates to the duke's authority during the 1670s.
In his last letters to his family Kalckstein asked his wife to move to Poland and there, raise their children up in the Lutheran faith and teach their children the fundamentals of arithmetic as well as the Polish language. In a separate letter to his children he told them to "learn Polish, and secure yourselves in Poland for there is no place for us left in the now enslaved Prussia".
In popular culture.
von Kalckstein was the prototype for the character of Krzysztof Dowgird in a popular 70's Polish TV action series "Czarne Chmury" (Dark Clouds).

Hurricane Bud (2006)

Hurricane Bud was the first hurricane and second named tropical cyclone of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. It formed as a tropical depression on July 10, to the south of the southern tip of Baja California. Shortly after, it became a tropical storm, and soon after the storm began to develop an eye. It began to intensify rapidly and was upgraded to a hurricane on July 11. Bud reached its peak intensity on July 13, becoming a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale at its peak. After reaching cooler waters and an unfavorable environment, the hurricane rapidly weakened and dropped to a tropical depression status on July 15. The system continued to lose its convection and eventually degenerated by the next day. As the storm remained away from land, no effects were reported as a tropical cyclone, though its remnant brought precipitation to Hawaii.
Meteorological history.
On June 27, 2006, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa. It proceeded westward across the Atlantic Ocean and emerged into the eastern Pacific by July 7. The wave spawned an area of low pressure, about to the south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Interest in the system grew over the next day, and convection gradually became better organized. Early on July 11, the low was designated as a tropical depression. The storm tracked west-northwestward throughout its entire duration, under the steering currents of a mid-level subtropical ridge which extended westward from northern Mexico.
Initially, a small upper-level low pressure system to the north of the depression generated northerly wind shear and dry air, which inhibited the development of thunderstorm activity. However, after the tropical depression was designated, the low weakened, and the wind shear relented. Located over warm waters, the storm attained tropical storm status at 0600 UTC on July 11, and as such it was named "Bud" by the National Hurricane Center. Subsequently, the storm quickly intensified. With more favorable conditions, the storm displayed a fairly organized banding pattern, and the previously exposed center of circulation became surrounded by convection. At 0000 UTC on July 12, the storm developed an eye and was upgraded to a hurricane. The convection surrounding the center deepened, and a burst of thunderstorm activity within the southeastern eyewall obscured the eye on satellite imagery. Outflow was well established in all quadrants, though it was slightly restricted to the east, which was believed to have resulted from interaction with Tropical Storm Carlotta. Later on July 12, Bud was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.
The storm attained major hurricane status as a Category 3 storm early on July 13. It presented a well-defined eye that was about in diameter, which was enveloped within by a complete ring of deep thunderstorms. A small cyclone, the area of winds contracted somewhat at around the same time. At 0600 UTC that day, the hurricane reached its peak intensity, with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 953 mb. Subsequently encountering cooler waters and stable air, rapid weakening began. As a result of the weakening trend, Bud became a Category 2 storm at 1800 UTC. The eye became obscured, and core convective cloud tops began to warm. Early on July 14, the storm dropped below hurricane status and lost much of its convection during the day. In addition to the cooler sea surface temperatures and an unfavorable environment, southeasterly shear contributed to the weakening. By the evening, only a patch of thunderstorm activity lingered to the north of the center. On July 15, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression, and it degenerated into a remnant low the next day. The low fully dissipated within the low-level easterly trade winds on July 17, about east-northeast of Hawaii.
Impact.
As a tropical cyclone Bud did not impact land Bud remained away from land, no effects, property damage or fatalities were reported; no ships were affected, and no tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued. The remnants of Bud later brought light rainfall to the Hawaiian islands on July 19, two days after it dissipated.
