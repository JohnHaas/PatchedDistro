St. Thomas Aquinas Chapel (Ojai, California)

St. Thomas Aquinas Chapel is a former Catholic chapel located in Ojai, in Ventura County of southern California. It now houses the city's museum, research library, and historical society.
History.
Church.
The St. Thomas Aquinas Chapel was designed by regionally renowned San Diego architect Richard Requa, and Frank Mead, in the Mission Revival with Spanish Colonial Revival style. It was built in 1918 to replace Ojai's original wooden Catholic church that had been destroyed by fire. Requa also designed the Mission—Spanish Colonial styled downtown Arcade and Watchtower landmarks, as part of civic leader Edward Drummond Libbey's early 20th century Ojai city beautification project.
Transition.
In 1963, the parish outgrew the downtown facility and moved to Meiners Oaks. By the early 1990s, the historic chapel was described as "cracked and crumbling to its foundation, and temporarily locked behind a rented chain-link fence." In 1990 church officials considered demolishing the chapel and selling the land. City officials and historical and architectural preservationists responded by seeking funding to acquirre and preserve the building. 
In 1993 the City of Ojai purchased the historic chapel and parish hall from the Catholic Church for $385,000. The city restored and renovated the building for use by Ojai city and Ojai Valley non-profit organizations. The Aquinas chapel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.
Current civic uses.
The St. Thomas Aquinas Chapel building now houses the Ojai Valley Museum, Ojai Valley Historical Society, and the Ojai Valley Museum Research Library. The museum exhibits collections of vintage Ojai pioneer artifacts and photographs, Chumash Native American baskets, and contemporary art.

Usibelli, Alaska

Usibelli is an unincorporated community in Denali Borough, Alaska, United States, 5 miles (8 km) east of Healy. Its elevation is 1,654 feet (504 m). The community is named for the Usibelli Coal Mine; located near the community, the mine is the chief economic enterprise in the area. With its large deposits and its status as the only coal mine in the state, Usibelli Coal Mine has long been prominent; it is a primary supplier for coal-fired power plants in the Fairbanks area and in southern Alaska, and it exports coal to South Korea and Chile. In recent years, the mine has stood to benefit from efforts for American energy independence; a bill in the United States Senate in 2008 was amended to encourage conversion of coal into liquid fuels for the use of the United States Air Force.

Bloch equations

In physics and chemistry, specifically in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electron spin resonance (ESR), the Bloch equations are a set of macroscopic equations that are used to calculate the nuclear magnetization M = ("M""x", "M""y", "M""z") as a function of time when relaxation times "T"1 and "T"2 are present. These are phenomenological equations that were introduced by Felix Bloch in 1946. Sometimes they are called the equations of motion of nuclear magnetization.
Bloch equations in laboratory (stationary) frame of reference.
Let M("t") = ("Mx"("t"), "My"("t"), "Mz"("t")) be the nuclear magnetization. Then the Bloch equations read:
where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B("t") = ("B""x"("t"), "B""y"("t"), "B"0 + Δ"B""z"(t)) is the magnetic field experienced by the nuclei.
The "z" component of the magnetic field B is sometimes composed of two terms:
M("t") × B("t") is the cross product of these two vectors.
"M"0 is the steady state nuclear magnetization (that is, for example, when t → ∞); it is in the "z" direction.
Physical background.
With no relaxation (that is both "T"1 and "T"2 → ∞) the above equations simplify to:
or, in vector notation:
This is the equation for Larmor precession of the nuclear magnetization "M" in an external magnetic field B.
The relaxation terms,
represent an established physical process of transverse and longitudinal relaxation of nuclear magnetization M.
Bloch equations are macroscopic equations.
These equations are not "microscopic": they do not describe the equation of motion of individual nuclear magnetic moments. These are governed and described by laws of quantum mechanics.
Bloch equations are "macroscopic": they describe the equations of motion of macroscopic nuclear magnetization that can be obtained by summing up all nuclear magnetic moment in the sample.
Alternative forms of Bloch equations.
Opening the vector product brackets in the Bloch equations leads to:
The above form is further simplified assuming
where "i" = √(-1). After some algebra one obtains:
where
is the complex conjugate of "Mxy". The real and imaginary parts of "Mxy" correspond to "Mx" and "My" respectively.
"Mxy" is sometimes called transverse nuclear magnetization.
Bloch equations in rotating frame of reference.
In a rotating frame of reference, it is easier to understand the behaviour of the nuclear magnetization M. This is the motivation:
Solution of Bloch equations with "T"1, "T"2 → ∞.
Assume that:
Then the Bloch equations are simplified to:
These are two (not coupled) linear differential equations. Their solution is:
Thus the transverse magnetization, "M"xy, rotates around the "z" axis with angular frequency ω0 = γ"B"0 in clockwise direction (this is due to the negative sign in the exponent).
The longitudinal magnetization, "M"z remains constant in time. This is also how the transverse magnetization appears to an observer in the laboratory frame of reference (that is to a stationary observer).
"M"xy("t") is translated in the following way into observable quantities of "M"x("t") and "M"y("t"): Since
then
where Re("z") and Im("z") are functions that return the real and imaginary part of complex number "z". In this calculation it was assumed that "M"xy(0) is a real number.
Transformation to rotating frame of reference.
This is the conclusion of the previous section: in a constant magnetic field "B"0 along "z" axis the transverse magnetization "M"xy rotates around this axis in clockwise direction with angular frequency ω0. If the observer were rotating around the same axis in clockwise direction with angular frequency Ω, "M"xy it would appear to him rotating with angular frequency ω0 - Ω. Specifically, if the observer were rotating around the same axis in
clockwise direction with angular frequency ω0, the transverse magnetization "M"xy would appear to him stationary.
This can be expressed mathematically in the following way:
Obviously:
What is "Mxy"′("t")? Expressing the argument at the beginning of this section in a mathematical way:
Equation of motion of transverse magnetization in rotating frame of reference.
What is the equation of motion of "Mxy"′("t")?
Substitute from the Bloch equation in laboratory frame of reference:
But by assumption in the previous section: "B"z′("t") = "B"z("t") = "B"0 + Δ"B"z("t"). Substituting into the equation above:
This is the meaning of terms on the right hand side of this equation:
Similarly, the equation of motion of "Mz" in the rotating frame of reference is:
Simple solutions of Bloch equations.
Relaxation of transverse nuclear magnetization "Mxy".
Assume that:
Then in the rotating frame of reference, the equation of motion for the transverse nuclear magnetization, "M"xy'("t") simplifies to:
This is a linear ordinary differential equation and its solution is
where "M"xy'(0) is the transverse nuclear magnetization in the rotating frame at time "t" = 0. This is the initial condition for the differential equation.
Note that when the rotating frame of reference rotates "exactly" at the Larmor frequency (this is the physical meaning of the above assumption Ω = ω0), the vector of transverse nuclear magnetization, "M"xy("t") appears to be stationary.

Fritz Haeg

Fritz Haeg (born 1969) is an American artist whose work spans a range of disciplines and media including gardens, dance, performance, design, installation, ecology and architecture, most of which is commissioned and presented by art museums and institutions. His work often involves collaboration with other individuals and site specific projects that respond to particular places.
Life and work.
Haeg's recent architecture projects have included the design for various residential and art projects including the contemporary art gallery peres projects and the Bernardi residence, both in Los Angeles, CA. He studied architecture in Italy at the Istituto Universitario di Architettura di Venezia and Carnegie Mellon University, where he received his B.Arch. He has variously taught in architecture, design, and fine art programs at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), Art Center College of Design, Parsons School of Design, and the University of Southern California.
Haeg is based in a geodesic dome in Los Angeles, California.
Gardenlab (2000).
In 2000 he established Gardenlab, a loose umbrella for his ecology related art and design projects. This initially included community gardens for Art Center College of Design and later California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) where he was an instructor.
Sundown Salon (2001 - 2006).
In 2000 Haeg moved into a geodesic dome in the hills of Los Angeles, California, where in 2001 he established Sundown Salon, a regular series of events, performances and happenings that attracted a diverse crowd, and galvanized a community of east side Los Angeles artists, designers, musicians, and performers. Those who presented work included artists Anna Sew Hoy, Yoshua Okon, Dean Sameshima, Alice Konitz, Pae White, Eve Fowler, Liz Larner, Christopher Peters, Pipilotti Rist, Katie Grinnan, and Jeff Burton; writers Slava Mogutin, Chris Abani, Trinie Dalton and Eileen Myles; and collectives My Barbarian, Los Super Elegantes, Assume Vivid Astro Focus, Lesbians to the Rescue (LTTR), Robbinschilds, and Janfamily. In 2006 the Sundown Salon events came to an end, to be replaced by Sundown Schoolhouse. First based in the geodesic dome as a seasonal self-organized educational environment spanning disciplines, it is now itinerant with programming connected to Haeg's various initiatives.
Edible Estates (2005).
In 2005 he began planting a series of gardens called Edible Estates, a revival of the Victory garden movement. Starting in the geographic center of the United States, Salina, Kansas, he selected a local family of willing gardeners to have their lawn removed and replaced with a kitchen garden, of his design. The first garden was commissioned by the Salina Art Center, with later editions in Lakewood, California (2006), Maplewood, New Jersey (2007), London, England, (commissioned by Tate Modern in 2007), Austin, Texas, (commissioned by Arthouse in 2008), Baltimore, Maryland, (commissioned by Contemporary Museum Baltimore in 2008), and most recently a public demonstration garden at Descanso Gardens in La Cañada Flintridge, California. The book, "Edible Estates: Attack on the Front Lawn", was published by Metropolis Books in spring 2008. It is a call for the replacement of the front lawn with edible landscapes, featuring examples of his previous Edible Estate gardens accompanied by essays from Diana Balmori, Michael Pollan and Rosalind Creasy.
Sundown Schoolhouse (2006).
Sundown Schoolhouse is a series of classes hosted in Haeg's home in Los Angeles. The program started in 2006, just as his related event series "Sundown Salons" concluded. The school was "founded on the premise that artists, designers, performers and writers should be powerful and active agents in society, engaging in a rich and complex dialog that extends to the outside world. The Schoolhouse seeks to present an alternate model for educational and artistic practice, one in which public interaction, physical connectedness, and responsiveness to place are valued above all else." In 2009, a book was published about the activities at then Salon and Schoolhouse.
The Sundown Schoolhouse group presented classes such as Dancing 9-5, Library for the Future, and 'Practicing Moving.' Other activities considered part of the program have included casual meals and yoga sessions. The Schoolhouse responds to the general interests within its community, and often relates to Haeg's other exhibits and projects. Under the name of Sundown Schoolhouse, Haeg has worked with institutions such as Whitney Museum of American Art, Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
Visiting hosts and lecturers are invited to organize courses, seminars, and events. Participants and collaborators include Emily Roysdon, Andrea Zittel, Damon Rich, founder of the Center for Urban Pedagogy and Eileen Myles.
Animal Estates (2008).
Animal Estates proposes the strategic reintroduction of native animals into cities. Each edition of the project is commissioned and presented by a local museum which includes various combinations of related performances, displays, installations, exhibitions, documentary videos, and printed materials such as a local field guide. The project debuted at the 2008 Whitney Biennial featuring a designed beaver pond in the sunken courtyard, an eagle's nest perched above the museum entry. Later 2008 editions are in Cambridge, Massachusetts (Center for Advanced Visual Studies at MIT), San Francisco, California (San Francisco Museum of Modern Art), Portland, Oregon (Douglas F. Cooley Memorial Art Gallery, Reed College), and Utrecht, The Netherlands (Casco Office for Art, Design and Theory).

Artigas Gardens

The Artigas Gardens () are a park in La Pobla de Lillet, Catalonia. Built between 1905 and 1906, and were designed by the modernist architect Antoni Gaudí.
History and description.
In 1905, Gaudí travelled to Lillet to build the chalet of Catllaràs, a mountain refuge for the engineers of the coal mine that supplied the Asland cement plant in the nearby municipality of Castellar de n'Hug. The cement plant was owned by Eusebi Güell, a rich industrialist who was Gaudí's principal patron. While in Lillet, Gaudí stayed in the house of the textile magnate, Joan Artigas i Alart, who had an estate named "Font de la Magnèsia", on the Llobregat river. As thanks for the hospitality of Mr. Artigas, Gaudí designed these gardens for him.
Gaudí had done a similar project, although on a smaller scale, at Park Güell which he was then building in the Gràcia District of Barcelona. He sent some of Park Güell's workers to Lillet, and the resulting stylistic and structural similarities between the two locations are obvious. As he did with Parc Güell, Gaudí designed the Artigas Gardens fully integrated with the surrounding natural environment. He also built an artificial grotto, a typical Gaudí hallmark, like the one he had designed for the cascade of the Parc de la Ciutadella.
Gaudí designed the garden for the visitor, with a path highlighting several places of interest:
As with so many others of his works, Gaudí filled the gardens with Christian symbols. For these gardens, he took the symbols from the four gospels. Tetramorph images are found throughout the park: the angel of Saint Matthew at la Cascada; the eagle of Saint John at the Coix arch bridge, which crosses the Llobregat river; the lion of Saint Mark at la Pèrgola; and the bull of Saint Luke at the Bull Fountain. These four images are situated in the form of a cross.
By the end of 1971, the gardens were practically abandoned when an article about the Gardens was published which brought Gaudí's authorship to light. In 1992, they were restored under the supervision of the Reial Càtedra Gaudí. The current sculptures are the work of Ramon Millet i Domènech. The gardens are now owned by the municipality and are open to the public.

Forsakar Nature Reserve

The Forsakar Nature Reserve () is situated in the North-Eastern part of the Scania province of Sweden, in the Kristianstad municipality near the village of Degeberga. The 2.5 hectare large nature reserve was founded 1928 and mainly encompasses a 750 metres long and 40 metres deep ravine
. The ravine runs from west to east and is likely a product of erosion during some of the ice ages.
The Forsaker Creek () runs through the nature reserve and passes the Forsakar Waterfalls (), the upper fall having a free fall of 7.4 metres and the lower fall having a free fall of 10.6 metres. The bedrock of the ravine consists of Gneiss. The nature reserve has three minor dams that were erected during the late 19th century and the early 20th century to create hydroelectricity. The dams are nowadays dismantled and inactive.
The vegetation of the Forsaker Nature Reserve is dominated by beech forest. Longside the creek is a more humid forest vegetation including alder, ash, elm and hornbeam.
Characteristic resident birds of the nature reserve are amongst others the white-throated dipper, grey wagtail and the winter wren. Common birds of the beech forest are the wood warbler, hawfinch, tawny owl and the lesser spotted woodpecker. Amongst mammals in the nature reserve the mink and pine marten are common. When it comes to insects some rarily seen species have been reported such as rove beetles, carrion beetles, the Agathomyia wankowiczi fly and the endangered Carabus intricatus beetle.

Caminalcules

Caminalcules (from Camin and animalcule) are a group of animal-like life forms invented by Professor Joseph H. Camin (University of Kansas) as a tool for understanding phylogenetics. Interested in how taxonomists group species, he designed these creatures to show an evolutionary pattern of divergence and diversification in morphology. There are 29 recent 'species' of Caminalcules and 48 fossil forms.
The Caminalcules first appeared in print in the journal "Systematic Zoology" (now "Systematic Biology") in 1983, four years after Camin's death in 1979. Robert R. Sokal published four papers, the first showing the full set of Caminacules and the second using them to compare methods in numerical taxonomy. They have been used in biology education to teach the principles of systematics and evolution.

National Archives of Romania

[[Image:NatlArchivesBucharest2.JPG|thumb|Bucharest headquarters of the National Archives of Romania, located at 49 Bd. Regina 
Elisabeta, across the street from Cişmigiu Gardens and adjacent to Bucharest City Hall.]]
The National Archives of Romania (), until 1996 the State Archives ("Arhivele Statului"), are the national archives of Romania, headquartered in Bucharest. It is subordinate to the Ministry of Interior and Administrative Reform. There are 42 regional branches, one in each county of Romania and one in Bucharest (holding documents pertaining specifically to the city).
Attributes.
By law nr. 16/1996 (expected to be replaced by the end of 2008, in order to update the existing law and comply with EU requirements), the Archives establishes norms for archival activity; implements measures from the law on archives; receives documents for the National Archival Deposit of Romania; inventories, selects and preserves the documents it holds; preserves documents on microfilm and other formats; maintains an archival database; edits the quarterly "Revista Arhivelor" and other specialty publications; ensures the training of qualified archivists through the Archival Faculty and the National School for Archival Training; attests whether a certain document forms part of the National Archival Deposit of Romania; authorises the temporary removal from Romania of documents in the Deposit for scientific or cultural purposes; maintains relations with corresponding institutions, applies international conventions in the field and participates in international archivists' congresses and conferences; and assures that documents in the Deposit are protected, both in peace and wartime.
The law defines the National Archival Deposit of Romania as "documents official and private, diplomatic and consular, memoirs, manuscripts, proclamations, summons, announcements, plans, sketches, maps, film prints and similar objects, seals, as well as photo, video, audio and computer recordings, with historic value, produced in Romania or by Romanian creators abroad".
The Archives has been part of the International Council on Archives since 1954; has bilateral agreements with corresponding institutions in France, Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria, the People's Republic of China and other countries; and is part of the European Archives Group and the European Board of National Archivists.
The Bucharest headquarters has two study rooms as well as a microfilm room open weekdays to researchers (over 6,500 or about 30 a day in 2007). Church and family records are often solicited, as well as documents on the history of Communism and on land reform, collectivisation and nationalisation. Documents can also be consulted at the Archives' 42 branches. There is also a library at the headquarters, containing some 70,000 books and 50,000 periodicals, many of them rare and valuable; again, every branch has its own library.
History.
At least as early as the 18th century, archives were kept in the Danubian Principalities by the princely chancellery, by church authorities and privately by dignitaries of various ranks in the "boyar" hierarchy. The oldest places for preserving documents were monasteries, which, being secure, also kept secular documents. For instance, in 1775 the Metropolis of Bucharest is known to have kept a general archive that included private documents such as property delimitations.
The Archives of Wallachia were established on 1 May 1831, and those of Moldavia on 1 January 1832, as the countries' first modern administrative laws, "Regulamentul Organic", took effect. At first, these archives were of a rather theoretical nature, as the legislation referred only to their budget and number of personnel, and not to archival activity. This vagueness had an adverse impact, despite the fact that important cultural figures served as directors, including Gheorghe Asachi, Ion Heliade Rădulescu and Grigore Alexandrescu. In 1840, an attempt was made to regulate the sorting and evaluation of archival documents, but it was only in 1862, with the Union of the Principalities, that the Archives were placed under a General Directorate at Bucharest, with the Iaşi archives made subordinate. At that time, a distinction was made between documents with a historical value and a practical one, and the institution was made subordinate to the Ministry of Justice, Religious Affairs and Public Education. This is usually considered the point at which the modern Archives were established; in 1864, following the secularization of monastery estates in Romania, its collections were enriched as the state took over a significant number of documents. Further regulations were enacted in 1869 and 1872; Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu served as director from 1876 to 1900, followed by Dimitrie Onciul (1900–23).
In Transylvania, the Hungarian authorities kept their own archives until the Kingdom of Hungary was partitioned following the Battle of Mohács in 1526. After Transylvania entered the Habsburg Empire in 1688, methods of document preservation gradually improved, notably through the introduction of registers at the chief administrative institutions. When the Hungarian State Archives were established in 1875, most of the old Transylvanian archives were moved to Budapest. Thus, at the end of the 19th century, documents pertaining to Transylvania, as well as the Banat and Bukovina, were centralised at the state archives in Budapest ("Országos Lévéltár") and Vienna ("Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchiv").
After Romania expanded in 1918 at the end of World War I, State Archives were established in three newly acquired historical regions: at Cluj in 1920 for Transylvania, at Cernăuţi in 1924 for Bukovina and at Chişinău in 1925 for Bessarabia. In 1925, a new law governing the State Archives went into effect and, among other provisions, called for regional directorates to be set up. The institution was subordinate to the Ministry of Public Education. Constantin Moisil was the director from 1923 to 1938, followed by Aurelian Sacerdoțeanu (1938–1953).
In 1951, during the early Communist period, the State Archives Directorate passed under the control of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Soviet organisational model was adopted. A new archival law was adopted in 1996, following the regime's collapse. During the 2000s, the Archives has pursued a policy of infrastructure modernisation, including computerisation.

"Ackermann's Repository of Arts" was an illustrated, British periodical published from 1809-1829 by Rudolph Ackermann. Although commonly called "Ackermann's Repository, or, simply Ackerman's, the formal title of the journal was Repository of arts, literature, commerce, manufactures, fashions, and politics", and it did, indeed cover all of these fields. In its day, it had great influence on English taste in fashion, architecture, and literature.

Nasty Quacks is a 1945 Warner Bros. cartoon in the "Merrie Melodies" series. It was the final Daffy Duck cartoon directed by Frank Tashlin, who is not credited as he had already left the studio for the second time (this time, for good). Voices of the male characters are performed by Mel Blanc.
Summary.
The father of a suburban family gets a black duckling for his daughter, Agnes, who dotes on the duck. The duck quickly grows up to become Daffy Duck, whose loud and obnoxious behavior is driving the man to distraction, but Agnes defends her pet at every turn.
The father then buys a white duckling for Agnes, who changes her focus totally to the new duckling. The father comes at Daffy with murder in his eyes, and chases Daffy around the house. Daffy hides in the room where the duckling is being kept. He decides to kill the duckling, but has a pang of conscience and decides to make the duckling grow to adult size, and "then" kill him. Daffy pours vitamins down the duckling's throat. With a "bay-woop", the duckling instantly grows into adulthood - and turns out to be a shapely "female" duck. Daffy looks at the camera and shrugs his shoulders.
Cut to the father walking down the stairs, laughing to himself, thinking he has chased Daffy out of the house. He is stunned to see Daffy; the female; and several newly-born ducklings bouncing around the dinner table, as Daffy is launching into one of his raucous stories.

The younger son of the politician George Treby, he was commissioned into the British Army. He was promoted to Captain and Lieutenant-Colonel in the 1st Foot Guards in 1758. 
Treby entered the House of Commons for Plympton Erle at a by-election in 1761 to replace his elder brother, George Treby. However, he died in 1763. He was replaced at the following by-election by his brother-in-law, Paul Henry Ourry, who also inherited the Treby family's residence, Plymton House.

Some By Sea

Some By Sea is an orchestral indie rock band from Tacoma, Washington. They have received comparisons to many bands, including Death Cab for Cutie and The Arcade Fire.
History.
Some By Sea originally formed as the solo project of Chris Du Bray in 2002. His solo act grew with the induction of Eino Holm. In January 2003 Rachel Lee Bowman played her first show with the group, and allowed the band to expand and develop new material. After meeting at a local show, Daniel Disparte (on drums) and David Bilbrey (on bass) joined the outfit in October 2003 and solidified the line-up. Eino Holm left the group in November 2004. David Bilbrey decided to start playing guitar. Blake Johnston joined as the new bass player in January 2005. Some By Sea signed with Sidecho Records in summer 2005. Blake quit in December 2005 and was replaced by Tom Pearson. Following the release of On Fire! (igloo) on March 7, 2006, Tom Pearson & Daniel Disparte chose to leave the group (April 2006) to pursue other interests. From April 2006 and August 2006 Some By Sea played their remaining shows with Lee Haines, AJ Gard and other friends. 
Between January 2003 and August 2006 Some By Sea played approximately 200 shows.
The band released their debut album, "Get Off The Ground If You're Scared", in January 2004, on their own label, Kringle Recordings. "Get Off the Ground If You're Scared" was recorded by Chris Du Bray, Eino Holm and Rachel Lee Bowman in June 2003. After touring for their debut album, Some By Sea returned to the studio to record new material. Some of this material was released on their "The Saddest Christmas EP", also on Kringle Recordings. Both "Get Off The Ground If You're Scared" and "The Saddest Christmas EP" are now out of print.
In 2005, Some By Sea signed with SideCho Records. The following spring (March 7, 2006), the band released their sophomore LP, "", which received many positive reviews. After their tour in support of their latest album, Some By Sea announced they would be disbanding. Their final show was played to a full room at Hell's Kitchen in Tacoma on August 11, 2006 with Cavalier, Tex & Speaker Speaker. Chris DuBray later spoke about the break-up in an interview for his next band, Ghosts & Liars:
"It was more of a series of frustrating circumstances that lead me to decide I couldn't take it much longer. When we returned from our first "On Fire! (Igloo)" tour in April of 2006, we'd all stopped communicating to each other in any way that wasn't passive aggressive... Nothing that occurred from that point on ever felt 100 percent honest and healthy."

Kwon Yang-sook

Kwon Yang-sook (; ; born 23 December 1947) is the widow of the 9th President of South Korea Roh Moo-hyun, who committed suicide on May 23, 2009 by jumping off a cliff. She was the first lady when Roh was in office. She is a Buddhist, with the Dharma name "Daedeokhwa", and won support from the Buddhist community during her husband's presidential campaign.
Over the Lunar New Year holiday in 2005, Kwon and her husband Roh underwent plastic surgery of their eyelids. Earlier, Kwon missed an official event claiming to have a cold. The publicly cited reason for the procedure was medical, but many believe that the added crease on the upper eyelids and removal of excess skin and puffiness on both lids were cosmetic in nature.
After Roh's term ended, Kwon was embroiled in a bribery scandal involving her husband. According to Roh's Web site, Kwon borrowed $1 million from Park Yeon-Cha, CEO of Taekwang Industry, to repay a personal debt. However, during questioning by police, Kwon refused to disclose how and where the money was spent. Roh later committed suicide due to stress from the investigation. All charges were then dropped against the couple.

Shahana

Shahana(raga) is an Indian classical upper-tetrachord-dominant Kanada-anga raga, from the Kafi thaat, allied with Bageshree and Bhimpalasi. The shuddha Dhaivat is an important rest note (nyaas swara).
It is a Ubhaya Vakra sampoorna ragam. Vakra means crooked. Ubhaya Vakra means that the notes in both ascent and descent follow a zig zag pattern. The notes in ascending and descending scale do not follow a strict progression. Hence the note phrases contain such vakra phrases, lending a unique beauty to this rāgam. Though it is a sampoorna rāgam (contains all 7 notes), the vakra scale means it is not considered a melakarta, as melakarta rāgams must have strictly ascending and descending scales. It is also classified as a rakti raga (raga with high melodic content).
Its ārohaṇa-avarohaṇa structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see swaras in Carnatic music for details on below notation and terms):
The notes used in this scale are Shadjam, Chathusruthi Rishabham, Antara Gandharam, Suddha Madhyamam, Panchamam, Chathusruthi Dhaivatham and Kaisiki Nishadham. Its characteristic phrases are (R2 G3 M1 P), (P M1 D2 N2), (N2 S D2), (G3 M1 R2). Shahana has a distinct mood due to these phrases and characteristic gamakams and is rarely confused with other ragams.
Shahana has a close relationship to Dwijawanthi. The use of Anthara Gaandharam in R2 G2 R2 makes it different from Dwijawanthi, while Dwijawanthi uses Saadharana Gaandharam.
Select compositions.
There are a large number of popular songs composed in this rāgam in Carnatic music as well as Tamil film music. Here are some Carnatic music compositions.

Kodak DCS

The Kodak Digital Camera System is a series of digital single-lens reflex cameras and digital camera backs that were released by Kodak in the 1990s and 2000s, and discontinued in 2005. They were all based on existing 35mm film SLRs from Nikon and Canon. The range included the original Kodak DCS, the very first commercially available digital SLR.
History.
In 1975 Kodak engineer Steven Sasson invented the first digital still camera, which used a Fairchild 100 x 100 pixel CCD. By 1986 Kodak had developed a sensor with 1.4 million pixels.
A number of other inventions were made to increase usability, including improvements in sensor technology, the first Raw image format DCR, and usable host software. The original Kodak DCS was launched in 1991, and was based around a stock Nikon F3 SLR with digital components. It used a 1.3-megapixel Kodak KAF-1300 sensor, and a separate shoulder-mounted processing and storage unit. The DCS 200 series of 1992 condensed the storage unit into a module which mounted onto the base and back of a stock Nikon F801s SLR. The module contained a built-in 80 megabyte hard drive and was powered with AA batteries. It was followed by the upgraded DCS 400 series of 1994, which replaced the hard drive with a PCMCIA card slot. The DCS 400 series included the 1.5-megapixel DCS 420, and the 6-megapixel Kodak DCS 460, which retailed for $28,000 on launch. In common with Kodak's later 6-megapixel models, the DCS 460 used the award-winning APS-H Kodak M6 sensor. A modified version of the DCS 420 was also sold by the Associated Press as the Associated Press NC2000. In parallel with the DCS 400 series Kodak also sold the analogous Kodak EOS DCS range, which was based on the Canon EOS-1N SLR. With the exception of the original DCS 100, these early models did not include LCD preview screens.
Kodak's subsequent models integrated the digital module with the camera body more thoroughly, and included LCD preview screens and removable batteries. The DCS 500 series of 1998 was also based on the Canon EOS-1N, and comprised the 2-megapixel DCS 520 and the 6-megapixel DCS 560, which initially had a suggested retail price of $28,500. These models were also sold by Canon, as the Canon D2000 and D6000 respectively, and were the first digital SLRs sold under the Canon name. Kodak used the same electronics package for the DCS 600 series, which was based around the Nikon F5. The DCS 600 range included the Kodak DCS 620x, a high-sensitivity model with an upgraded indium tin oxide sensor and a cyan-magenta-yellow Bayer filter, which had a then-unique top ISO setting of ISO 6400.
Kodak's concluded the initial DCS range with the DCS 700 series, which comprised the 2-megapixel DCS 720x, the 6-megapixel DCS 760, and the 6-megapixel DCS 760m, which had a monochrome sensor. By the time of launch, Kodak faced competition from the popular Nikon D1 and Nikon D1x, which were physically smaller and cheaper. The DCS 760's initial list price was $8,000.
Kodak final generation of DCS cameras was launched with the Kodak DCS Pro 14n, a 14-megapixel full-frame digital SLR, in 2002, and continued with the upgraded DCS PRO SLR/n in 2004. These two cameras were based on a Nikon F80 body, and were considerably more compact than previous Kodaks. They used sensors designed by Belgian imaging company FillFactory. The DCS PRO SLR/n was also accompanied by the Canon-compatible DCS PRO SLR/c, which was based on a Sigma SA9 SLR. Kodak discontinued the SLR/n and SLR/c in May 2005, to concentrate on compact digital cameras and high-end medium format digital backs for Leaf, among others.
Kodak continues to design and manufacture digital imaging sensors, including the full-frame 18-megapixel KAF-18500, which is used in the Leica M9 digital rangefinder.

El Son de la Negra

"El Son de la Negra" ("The Sound/Tune of the Black Woman") is a popular mariachi song written and originally interpreted by the Jaliscian musical composer Blas Galindo in 1940. It is commonly referred to as the "second national anthem of Mexico." The master piece was presented for the first time in the city of New York, but Jesús Jáuregui, a Mexican ethnologist, claims that along its history the song has undergone modifications and arrangements that can hardly be attributed to a single author or epoque. The song has become representative of Mexican folk or relative to Mexico worldwide. Jáureguis's more than two decades of research were presented on 15 July 2010 at a conference held in the state of Nayarit under the patronage of the state's "Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes". Among the specific topics discussed were the origin and authorship of the tune, its first recordings, excerpts from Galindo's memoirs, and photographs of older scores and lyrics.

Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel legislation

Since 2005, federal legislation has been introduced in the 109th Congress, 110th Congress, 111th Congress and the 112th Congress to amend Title 28 United States Code section 1259 to allow members of the United States Armed Forces to appeal court-martial convictions when the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces denies a petition for grant of review or extraordinary relief. In the 112th Congress the Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2011, H.R. 3133 was introduced in the House of Representatives and the Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2011, S. 1664 was introduced in the Senate. Both bills are currently pending.
Controversy over Supreme Court access.
Since the establishment of the Supreme Court by the United States Constitution in 1789, Congress has not allowed service members direct appeal to the nation’s highest court should the service member be convicted by courts-martial. In 1950 Congress created the modern military justice system by enacting, in 1951, the Uniform Code of Military Justice. In 1984 Congress passed the Military Justice Act of 1983, that gave service members limited access to the Supreme Court. Under existing law, Title 28 United States Code section 1259, a service member may appeal to the Supreme Court in death penalty cases or if review is granted by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) - which happens about twenty percent of the time. Also, the government can appeal any ruling in which the service member prevails by having the individual service judge advocate general certify an issue for appeal.
CAAF, as initially established in 1951 (known then as "Court of Military Appeals") was the final authority on cases arising under the military justice system, except for a limited number of cases considered by the Supreme Court under collateral proceedings, such as through writs of habeas corpus.
In March 2004, Norbert Basil MacLean III, a former United States Navy cryptologist, began to petition Congress to permit all court-martialed service members access to the Supreme Court. Under MacLean's proposal, which Rep Davis (D-Calif.) and Senator Feinstein (D-Calif.) adapted as introduced bills in the House of Representatives and Senate, service members would be able to access the nation's highest court if CAAF denied a grant of review or relief in extraordinary writ and writ-appeal cases.
An August 2006 report issued by the American Bar Association (ABA) showed that ninety percent of all court-martialed servicemembers whose cases were eligible for review by the court could not have Supreme Court review because the court had either denied a grant of a petition for review or denied extraordinary relief. The ABA called on Congress in 2006 to change the law and permit all court-martialed servicemembers the right of review in the high court.
109th Congress.
On April 23, 2004, the House Armed Services Committee sent a bipartisan letter, written by Reps. Davis (D-Calif.) and John Michael McHugh (R-NY), to The Pentagon asking for feedback on MacLean's proposal. Then-Principal Deputy General Counsel Daniel J. Dell'Orto wrote to lawmakers opposing MacLean's proposal of Supreme Court access for service members. According to the "Los Angeles Daily Journal", Dell'Orto stated that changing the law and giving service members greater Supreme Court access would only serve to burden the nation's highest court. Rep. Davis first introduced the "Equal Justice for Our Military Act" on March 17, 2005, in the 109th Congress. After its introduction the bill was opposed by the Bush administration through then-Department of Defense General Counsel William J. Haynes, II. Haynes wrote to Congress in opposition stating "there is no apparent justification to modify the current review process, thereby increasing the burden upon the Supreme Court and counsel to address the myriad of matters that would be encountered with expanded certiorari jurisdiction." The bill failed in the 109th Congress.
At the behest of MacLean, Legislative Research Inc. ("LRI"), based in California, developed two decades of military justice statistics to present to Congress. LRI completed its study in March 2006. In August 2006, the American Bar Association ("ABA") issued a report and unanimously passed a resolution urging Congress to correct the law and permit U.S. armed forces members equal access to the Supreme Court. The ABA report references military justice statistics compiled as a direct result of MacLean's work on this issue noting that: "CAAF denies petitions for grant of review and petitions for relief far more often than it grants them. While there is significant variation from year to year, in 2004-05, petitions for review were denied in 78.3 percent (581) of the cases and granted in 19.54 percent (145) of the cases. Petitions for grants of extraordinary relief were denied in 70.45 percent (31) of the cases and granted in 4.55 percent (2) of the cases. Equally sobering, the statistical compilation reveals that during the same time-period, there were 7,564 court-martial convictions and only 799 petitions for grant of review granted by CAAF."
110th Congress.
Reps. Susan A. Davis, (D-Calif.) and Ike Skelton (D-Mo.) of the House Armed Services Committee reintroduced the bill that had previously failed in the last Congress entitled the "Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2007", H.R. 3174. The reintroduced bill was in broader form and included not only denials for extraordinary writs but also petitions for direct review. It would amend 28 USC sections 1259(3) and (4) so that if the Court of Appeals denied review or relief to a service member an appeal could be taken to the Supreme Court. Six days after H.R. 3174's introduction, it received bipartisan support by Rep. Rodney Alexander (R-La.), a U.S. Air Force Reserve veteran, who signed on as cosponsor.
Senate Judiciary markup's bill and favorably reports it to full Senate.
On September 17, 2007, a companion bill, identical to the House bill, was introduced in the Senate by Senators Feinstein (D-Calif.), then-Republican Arlen Specter, and Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), entitled "Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel Act of 2007". When the Senate returned from its 2008 summer recess, Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, signed on as cosponsor to the bill. On September 11, 2008 the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously voted to approve S. 2052. The next day S. 2052 was placed on the Legislative Calendar of the Senate.
House suspends rules and passes its version of bill.
On September 27, 2008, the House of Representatives debated and passed, by two-thirds voice vote, the "Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2007", H.R. 3174. Rep. Lamar S. Smith (R-Tx.), the Ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee opposed the bill during floor debate arguing, among other things, that there were no hearings in the House Judiciary Committee. It was expected that the U.S. Senate would take up the House passed H.R. 3174 during the week of December 8, 2008. However, several print media and blogs had reported opposition by at least one Republican Senator who blocked a Senate floor vote on the bill.
111th Congress.
Early in the 111th Congress two identical bills were introduced in both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to give servicemembers the same right to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court as civilian citizens. On January 15, 2009, Rep. Davis (D-Calif.) Chairwoman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel|Subcommittee on Military Personnel of the House Armed Services Committee reintroduced the bill in the 111th Congress as the "Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2009", H.R. 569. H.R. 569 was referred to the House Judiciary Committee. Identical legislation was also introduced on January 30, 2009, when Senators Feinstein (D-Calif.), then-Republican Arlen Specter and Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) reintroduced the Senate bill in the 111th Congress as the "Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel Act of 2009", S. 357. The language of the reintroduced bills were the same as the previous bills in 110th Congress. Both the House and Senate bills were also the same language as MacLean first proposed to Congress in 2004.
In March 2009 before a joint session of the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees, Ira Novoselsky, the national commander of the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America announced that JWV was making the House bill and the issue of Supreme Court access for service members a legislative priority. Novoselsky asked the Veteran's Committee to weigh in on the important issue and stated that "JWV supports legislation that will restore due process and equal treatment under the law for our service members and veterans".
House subcommittee hearing.
On June 11, 2009, the Subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on H.R. 569. Witnesses who appeared before the subcommittee included retired Army Major General John D. Alternburg, Jr., Rep. Davis, and attorney Dwight H. Sullivan. Davis and Sullivan testified in support of the bill. Altenburg testified in opposition of the bill.
On July 30, 2009, the House Subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy held a mark up on H.R. 569 and approved the bill for full House Judiciary Committee action.
House Judiciary Committee markup, favorable report issued and placed on Union Calendar.
On January 27, 2010, the full House Judiciary Committee, by voice vote, favorably reported H.R. 569 to the House of Representatives.
On July 14, 2010, a U.S. House of Representatives Report was filed which amended H.R. 569 and changed its name to the "Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2010". H.R. 569 was placed on the Union Calendar of the U.S. House of Representatives. The House Report refers to MacLean in footnotes. One in particular states that "during the full Committee mark-up of H.R. 569, Members of the Minority charged that the bill was introduced primarily for the benefit of a single individual, former Navy Officer Norbert Basil MacLean, III. In fact, a number of individuals and organizations have taken note of the inherent injustice of the current law. Additionally, it should be pointed out that H.R. 569 applies only to courts-martial that were initiated on or after the effective date of the Act, which thereby forecloses any personal benefit to Mr. MacLean, whose court-martial was concluded well before this legislation was introduced."
112th Congress.
The Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2011 has been introduced in the House of Representatives as H.R. 3133 and in the Senate as S. 1664. Currently, no action has been taken on either bill.
Congressional Research Service reports.
On October 6, 2008, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) issued a report entitled "Supreme Court Appellate Jurisdiction Over Military Court Cases." The CRS report noted that under existing law the CAAF "functions as a gatekeeper for military appellants' access to Supreme Court review." The report further noted that "if the CAAF denies an appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court will typically lack the authority to review the decision. In contrast, criminal appellants in Article III courts have an automatic right of appeal to federal courts of appeals and then a right to petition the Supreme Court for review." On January 30, 2009, the CRS issued a second report also entitled "Supreme Court Appellate Jurisdiction Over Military Court Case." This CRS report discusses HR 569 in the 111th Congress.
Congressional Budget Office costings.
The United States Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued a cost estimate on October 22, 2008, regarding the Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel Act of 2007, S.2052, 110th Congress. The CBO estimated costs to be approximately $1 million a year if S.2052 was enacted which would include the workload of Department of Defense attorneys and Supreme Court clerks. Further it estimates a possible additional $1 million to $2 million in appropriated funds for the Department of Defense to defend a case in the Supreme Court if a servicemember petitioned the high court for a writ of certiorari. However, the CBO determined that by enacting S.2052 there would be no direct spending and it would impose no costs on local, state or tribal governments.
On October 27, 2008, the "Press-Enterprise" noted in an article that the cost to the average family if S.2052 was enacted would be $0.16. On the topic of costs related to an increase in workload, the American Bar Association stated in a letter to House leaders that "to those that argue that permitting equal access to the courts will create workload problems, we emphatically respond that nothing is more important than the provision of fundamental due process to our service members."
On June 11, 2009, Washington, DC attorney Dwight H. Sullivan testified before a House Judiciary subcommittee that the costs, should HR 569 (111th Congress) be passed, would be approximately $1,000 per case.
On February 2, 2010, the CBO issued a cost estimate on HR 569. The CBO's estimate indicates that "Based on information provided by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Supreme Court, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would increase the workload of DoD attorneys and Supreme Court clerks and would cost less than $1 million each year, assuming the availability of appropriated funds. We expect that the bill would make several hundred service members eligible to file petitions each year, but that only a small portion of those individuals would pursue review by the Supreme Court (based on the experience of individuals whose cases currently qualify for Supreme Court review). CBO cannot predict whether the Supreme Court would grant review of any particular petition. If the Supreme Court agreed to review any petitions, DoD would probably spend no more than $1 million in any year from appropriated funds to defend those cases. (Any such amounts would depend on the number and complexity of such cases.) Enacting H.R. 569 would not affect direct spending or revenues." The February 2010 estimate was considerably less in estimated costs compared to the previous CBO estimate in 2008.
What others have said about the legislation.
The major opponents and proponents of the legislation are:
Major opponents to the legislation.
The following are opponents to the legislation and have either testified before Congress or sent letters in opposition which are part of the Congressional record:
William J. Haynes II.
In 2002 the "Army Times" editorial board was critical of the Department of Defense (DoD) trying to prevent servicemembers from accessing the federal courts regarding military personnel issues. William J. Haynes II had submitted various proposals to Congress, in the DoD 2002 budget proposal, to not allow service members access to the federal courts to challenge military personnel issues such as promotions, retention actions, separations, retirement, enlistments and re-enlistements.
A front page article in the "Los Angeles Daily Journal" reported that Haynes opposed giving members of the U.S. Armed Forces access to the Supreme Court of the United States if they are court-martialed. In February 2006, he wrote letters to Congress opposing the "Equal Justice for Our Military Act", which was pending in the 109th Congress. Haynes opined that "there is no apparent justification to modify the current review process, thereby increasing the burden upon the Supreme Court and counsel to address the myriad of matters that would be encountered with expanded certiorari jurisdiction." The next month, in March 2006, Navy veteran Norbert Basil MacLean III lobbied lawmakers with twenty-two years of military justice statistics showing that over 80 percent of all court-martialed service members are shut out of seeking U.S. Supreme Court review. In August 2006, the American Bar Association issued a report and passed a resolution urging Congress to give servicemembers Supreme Court access.
In July 2007 Representative Susan A. Davis (D-Calif.) reintroduced the "Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2007", HR.3174. And in September 2007 Senators Dianne Feinstein and Arlen Specter introduced bipartisan identical legislation entitled the "Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel Act of 2007", S.2052 in the Senate. On September 27, 2008, during floor debate on HR 3174 in the U.S. House of Representatives Rep. Lamar S. Smith (R-Texas) cited a February 6, 2006, Haynes letter in support of his opposition to servicemembers having equal access to the U.S. Supreme Court. After debate the House passed HR 3174 by voice vote of a two-thirds majority.
Lamar Smith.
On September 27, 2008, Representative Lamar S. Smith (R-Texas) in a House floor debate on the "Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2007", HR 3174, opposed granting access to the Supreme Court of the United States to members of the U.S. Armed Forces. Smith had argued, among other things, that there had been no hearings in the House Judiciary Committee on the subject and for this and other reasons he opposed the legislation being considered on the House suspension calendar. In his floor debate, Smith cited a February 6, 2006, letter of former Department of Defense General Counsel William J. Haynes, II, who also opposed access of servicemembers to the Supreme Court. HR 3174 subsequently passed in the House by a two-thirds voice vote.
Proponents of the legislation.
The following are proponents to the legislation and have either testified before Congress or sent letters in support which are part of the Congressional record:
Norbert Basil MacLean III.
After MacLean was precluded from Supreme Court access by operation of 28 U.S.C. 1259(4), and learning that other service members were also, he began his advocacy to change the law. MacLean first started to petition Members of the 108th Congress in March 2004 to amend the law and permit service members access to the Supreme Court. MacLean's proposal, which was included in the HASC letter to the Defense Department, was simple: to permit a petition for writ of certiorari to be filed by any member of the U.S. Armed Forces who was denied review or relief by the CAAF. This concept would bring the Armed Forces court in line with other federal Courts of Appeal concerning Supreme Court review of federal criminal convictions. MacLean's proposal would afford service members full procedural due process protections in appellate review of courts-martial to the Supreme Court.
MacLean's commentary calling on Congress to take action to allow service members court access.
The "Los Angeles Daily Journal", the "San Francisco Daily Journal", the "Los Angeles Times" and the "Legal Times" published MacLean's commentary calling upon Congress to take action on pending bills allowing for service members to access the Supreme Court.
Criticism of MacLean's position.
U.S. Department of Defense officials in the George W. Bush administration were critical of MacLean's proposal to Congress. Department of Defense Principal Deputy General Counsel Daniel J. Dell'Orto indicated opposition to the issue of access to the Supreme Court for members of the U.S. Armed Forces. The House Armed Services Committee wrote a letter to the Defense Department attaching correspondence from MacLean on the inequity. Dell'Orto wrote back to the Armed Services committee criticizing MacLean's proposal for fear it would "increase the burden upon the Supreme Court." In 2006 then-Department of Defense General Counsel William J. Haynes, II was critical of MacLean's proposal and indicated that the Bush administration opposes giving servicemembers equal access to the Supreme Court. In February 2006 Haynes opined to Congress that "there is no apparent justification to modify the current review process, thereby increasing the burden upon the Supreme Court and counsel to address the myriad of matters that would be encountered with expanded certiorari jurisdiction."
After the House of Representatives passed the "Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2007", Robert E. Reed, an associate general counsel at the Department of Defense in the George W. Bush administration told the "New York Times" the legislation would increase the burdens on the Supreme Court and Defense Department lawyers, adding that supporters were not taking a “panoramic view.” “A lot of those supporters are only looking at this as a motherhood, apple pie sort of issue,” he said. “There’s a logic and a rationale to this. We’re not just trying to be mean and difficult for the defendants.” Reed's comment to the "New York Times" may have been in response to MacLean's 2007 comment to the "San Diego Union Tribune" when he (MacLean) said "I think there is a high likelihood that this bill will pass because voting against it would be like voting against Mom and warm apple pie.” Finally, Reed told the "New York Times" “It’s the same old people with the same old arguments and the same propositions.”
Praise of MacLean's position.
Despite critics in the George W. Bush administration, in 2005, the press secretary for Rep. Davis said in the "Los Angeles Daily Journal" that after considering MacLean's arguments, Davis believes both prosecution and defense should have equal opportunity to appeal to the Supreme Court. "He brought up a very important issue of equality under the law," Aaron Hunter, press secretary said.
The American Bar Association mentioned MacLean in its resolution and report to Congress in 2006 which urged the law be changed to permit members of the U.S. Armed Forces to have equal access to the Supreme Court. The ABA report references MacLean's work on military justice statistics.
During a 5 June 2009 House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on H.R. 569 (111th Congress), Rep. Davis made reference to MacLean in her testimony as "a tireless champion for this issue and other military justice reform on behalf of the service members and veterans that fall under the jurisdiction of those courts of appeal."
Support of veteran's groups, legal associations and retired judges.
The following organizations support service members' access to the Supreme Court:
Three retired chief judges of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces support the proposed legislation:

Stahlberg Models

Stahlberg was a Finnish company producing promotional plastic model cars mainly of Swedish Saab and Volvo automobiles usually in scales between 1:18 and 1:25. Stahlberg made models from the 1960s to about 1992, though its modern counterpart, Emek continues to make truck models (Klockau 2012).
Other Finnish companies producing similar sized plastic models were Aren, Emek Muovi, Ju Ju, Hot Toys, KMS Myynti, Muovo, Nyrhinen Ky, and Plasto.
Volvos and Saabs.
Stahlberg vehicles were not plastic model kits, but pre-assembled promotional models. Available mainly through car dealerships in Europe and the U.S., models were produced from about 1965 to about 1990. Usually Stahlbergs were packaged in a clear plastic bag (poly-bagged), though later models did come in blue and white boxes. One writer reminisces that when at the Volvo dealer with his father as a child, he remembers the models often would be "hanging on the pegboard behind the service desk" (Klockau 2012). 
Some standard Swedish models produced by Stahlberg were the Volvo 120-122 series (Amazon), 142 series, 164 series, 200 series, 700 series, and 66 / 300 series (DAFs). Saabs produced were Saab 99, 900 series, and 9000 series. Models were produced in 2-door, 4-door, and station wagon versions. Some models from earlier years are now getting rather hard to find, like the 244 sedan from the late 1960s which featured a bit better detail than later models and 'knobbier' tread tires. These early Volvos like the 164 had lovely two piece wheels with unpainted rims and the silver hubs. Later wheels were accurate single cast copies of the actual designs. 
Details and Model Variety.
Older Stahlbergs from the 1970s were cast in a solid color plastic while later ones had a metallic effect along with swirls and streaks in the plastic. 
The most common scale of models was 1:22 (about 9 inches long), however 1:32 (about 5 inches long), 1:25, 1:18, and a larger 1:12 scale (about 18 inches long) were also produced. 
Though Volvo and Saab were the most common Stahlberg clients, a perusal of eBay and other websites shows a few other vehicles were also contracted and appear to have been promotional in nature (Fintoys, no date). One example was the 1979 Mercedes-Benz 300 Touring (station wagon). Others were a rather rare Volkswagen Golf sedan, Saab 600, Lancia Delta in rally and non-rally form, and a 1978 DAF Volvo 66 (DAF was a Dutch truck and car maker purchased by Volvo). Reportedly, there was also a Saab Sonett, a few other Golfs, and some Toyotas, like the Corolla DX. The Saab 99 and 900 were also produced in police (""polis"") versions and some of the Volvo wagons were made in ambulance/medical assistance versions with red crosses on their sides and hoods.
Stahlberg made some of its Volvo and Saab models in slightly brighter toy-like colors for the British distributor, O. G. Plasto. These were packaged in colorful boxes (Minivolvo 2013).
European Promotionals.
While other European car makers preferred the manufacturing of promotional models made out of diecast zamac in 1:43 OR 1:35 scale, it seems Finnish companies were unique in Europe by producing models - often promotional models - in larger scales and in plastic. Both of these traits were similar to American promotional model companies like AMT, PMC, MPC, or Johan. Stahlberg was the most well known of these Scandinavian large scale promotional model producers for its cars through the 1980s, whereas Finnish Emek Muovi was known for trucks. Nyrhinen Ky was another similar Finnish producer that made VWs and Toyotas, though it is uncertain if these were made specifically as promotionals. 
Still, Stahlbergs were produced in a softer, somewhat more flexible, polyurethane plastic than the harder polystyrene of traditional American promotional models (Klockau 2012). Thus, Stahlbergs are prone to fewer cracks and breaks, yet are easier to scratch - similar to other toy vehicles molded in softer plastics. Models are molded in various colors and unpainted. Streaks of darker or lighter color are commonly found through the plastic.
Models include precise replication of proportions and detail of actual vehicles, including accurate moldings, logos, and name scripts. Tires are not rubber, but are made of the same type of plastic as body and chassis, though black. Models often have movable mud flaps behind rear wheels (which often are lost with play). Rather odd, and rarely seen on other miniatures of any type, are headlights often molded in white plastic as opposed to clear lenses. This may be the single most recognizable trait of the brand. 
Interior and chassis detail is often simpler than seen in US promotionals. Chassis usually have no detail, are plain, and simply say "Made in Finland", but some carry promotional advertising statements relating to the real car, like "Exceptional roadholding", "High standard of safety", or "Swedish quality".
Stahlberg Today.
Models can frequently be found on eBay and are popular sellers, commanding anywhere from US$30 to US$100. Around 1987, in honor of Volvo's 50th Anniversary, Stahlberg produced a 1927 Volvo Jakob plastic model for dealers, produced in 1:20 scale.
Around this time Stahlberg was apparently taken over by Emek Muovi, another Finnish plastic model maker, known for its trucks in 1:20 scale. Emek had either previously also made Volvo models similar to Stahlberg or, more likely, took over Stahlberg's dies and continued production. Emek, however, post 1990, is more known for its plastic trucks in 1:25 scale (Bickford 2013). Some Stahlberg models also were produced in the 1990s by a company in Estonia. Models are distinguished by "Made in Estonia" on their bases.

1997 Philadelphia Eagles season

The 1997 Philadelphia Eagles season was their 65th in the league. The team failed to improve on their previous output of 10–6, going only 6–9–1 and failing to reach the playoffs for the first time in three seasons.
Lowlights of the '97 campaign include a disheartening one-point loss at Dallas in Week 3, where starter Ty Detmer led the Birds on a potential game-winning drive late in regulation, only to see holder Tommy Hutton botch the hold on what would have been the deciding field goal from ex-Cowboys kicker Chris Boniol. In Week 7, the Eagles lost their first-ever game against the three-season-old Jacksonville Jaguars, and on November 10, in a "Monday Night Football" 24–12 home loss against San Francisco, a fan was spotted firing a flare gun in the upper deck. Six days later, at Memorial Stadium, the Eagles and Ravens engaged in a 10–10 tie, Philadelphia's first deadlock since 1986 against the Cardinals.
One bright spot during the year came on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, when rookie Bobby Hoying stepped in under center and threw for a career-high 313 yards and four touchdowns in a 44–42 win against the Cincinnati Bengals.
The 1997 campaign was notable in that it ended a 13-year radio partnership between broadcasters Merrill Reese and former Eagle Stan Walters on 94 WIP. Mike Quick became the color commentator the following season.

We Should Be Together (song)

"We Should Be Together" is a popular song by Cliff Richard. 
Composed by Bruce Roberts, the song bidded for the Christmas No.1 spot in 1991, however the song peaked at the No. 10 position - ultimately being beaten to the festive top spot by the re-release of Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" following the death of Freddie Mercury.
The song differed from Richard's previous Christmas efforts - primarily being a love song. The promotional video for the single tells the story of an offshore oil worker who makes the journey back to his home to join his family for Christmas. In the song, at around 3 minutes and 44 seconds, the solo trumpet quotes the 2nd theme from the second movement of Dvorak's 'New World' symphony. This quote bears significance to the song, as Dvorak wrote this symphony when he was missing his home.

Dick Johnson (glider pilot)

Richard (Dick) H. Johnson (January 10, 1923 – July 23, 2008) was a glider pilot, aeronautical engineer and prolific writer of articles for gliding magazines. He was an 11-time U.S. National Champion glider pilot, 9-time US Soaring Team pilot at the Soaring World Championships, held two World Gliding Records and is a member of the US Soaring Hall of Fame. He flew for 70 years and logged over 14,000 flying hours, including over 10,000 hours of non-powered flight time in sailplanes. He authored over 100 articles on soaring and flight tests of gliders.
Early years.
Dick Johnson was born on January 10, 1923 in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada. He grew up in Los Altos, California, where he learned the basics of flight and aerodynamics as a model airplane and glider enthusiast. He won the California State Hand-Launched Model Glider Championship in 1937.
In 1938, wanting to graduate to full-size aircraft, Johnson read Wolf Hirth's book "The Art of Soaring Flight" three times. Using a second-hand Northrup primary glider he purchased and being carefully towed by brother Dave driving a 1931 Model A Ford, he taught himself how to fly. Over a period of several months ground skims were gradually replaced by straight-ahead landings, S-turns, 180 degree turns, and finally 360 degree turn flights.
The following year Johnson and Dave purchased a Bowlus Baby Albatross intermediate glider kit, and assembled it in their spare time over fall, winter and spring of 1940. With his brother's assistance, they built a wooden trailer for the Baby Albatross glider, and towed the glider 3,000 miles to Elmira, New York. to enter the 1940 U.S. National Gliding Championships at age 17. As a self-taught pilot Johnson had not been licensed prior to this time, so before entering the contest he received a Private Glider Pilot license at Elmira and obtained a legal registration for his home-built Albatross. During the contest he earned his Silver C badge (badge #28), and placed 3rd overall in the contest.
World War II Years.
By 1941 Johnson owned a Schweizer SGS 2-8 2-seat metal intermediate training glider, had received his Commercial Glider Pilot license and gave flight instruction during weekends on Rosamond Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert of California. At the start of World War II, the U.S. Government took possession of his glider through the War Powers Act of 1941, and Johnson became a Civilian Glider Flight Instructor, training military glider pilots at 29 Palms Air Academy, California. Training was performed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for 14 months, with Johnson flying two 6-hour shifts per day - one shift as a glider instructor and one shift as a tow plane pilot. After 14 months of training no additional glider pilots were needed and Johnson obtained a co-pilot position with Pan American World Airways, Pacific Division in Consolidated PBY-3, Martin 120 and Boeing 314 flying boats. He was later assigned to the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) flying PBM-3 and PB-2Y3s. Johnson remained active as the area wing commander of the World War II Glider Pilots Association into his 80s.
The RJ-5.
The RJ-5 sailplane was one of the first to utilize a laminar flow airfoil, and the first to achieve a glide ratio of 40-to-1. In 1948 Johnson contracted with Harland Ross to design and build the glider (originally designated R-5). One key design decision was to use a NACA 63(2)-615 laminar flow airfoil selected by Dick Lyon. The NACA laminar airfoils were developed in secret during World War II, and subsequently released for public use after the war, but it its use here was unproven because no sailplane had used such an airfoil before.
However, other obligations prevented Ross from completing the project within the contracted one year schedule, so Johnson took delivery of the partially completed sailplane in 1949. He completed the construction in 1950, and under the direction of Dr. August Raspet of the AeroPhysics Research Laboratory of Mississippi State University, where Johnson was an Aeronautical Engineering student, he measured the glide ratio performance of the initial design at 33-to-1. With the help of Dr. Raspet, Johnson made several modifications which in 1951 resulted in a better than 40 to 1 glide ratio - the first sailplane to achieve that milestone. At Dr. Raspet's suggestion, the name was changed to the RJ-5. Dick Johnson flew the RJ-5 to win the US Open Class Nationals in 1950, 51, 52 and 54, to break the World Distance Record in 1951 and to break the 100 km Triangle World Speed Record in 1952. The World Distance flight of from Odessa, Texas to Salina, Kansas was the first glider flight to exceed 500 miles and broke the previous world record by . This record held for 12 years, until broken by Al Parker in a Sisu 1A glider that used a more refined laminar flow airfoil.
The RJ-5 has been restored and is on display at the National Soaring Museum in Elmira, New York.
Flight test evaluations.
Dick Johnson wrote more than 100 articles for Soaring magazine, consisting mostly of the "Flight Test Evaluation" series starting in 1976, which measured the performance of sailplanes utilizing the measurement methods taught by Dr Raspet and refined by Johnson. Funded by the Dallas Gliding Association, which did not have any financial ties to sailplane manufacturers, Johnson's evaluations were considered an unbiased evaluation and were reprinted in multiple languages and collected into book form. In addition to measuring the sailplane performance as received, these evaluations documented opportunities for measurable performance improvements such as wing smoothing, improved wing seals, turbulator inducing strips, and deturbulator strips.
Death.
Dick Johnson died July 23, 2008, at age 85. He was flying a Ventus A glider from a Midlothian, Texas airport when it crashed about 2.25 miles (3.5km) from the a airport after flying for some time. The Medical Examiner of Dallas County determined that Johnson died from the injuries he received in the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable accident cause to be an incapacitating cardiac event, as Johnson had severe coronary artery disease with symptoms and had been prescribed medication for it.

Academic and professional achievements.
Employed as aeronautical engineer first at Chance Vought, then at Temco Aircraft from 1953 to 1961 before becoming Chief Aerodynamicist at Texas Instruments (TI) from 1961 to official retirement in 1993. Remained an active consultant to a variety of companies through 2008.
His projects were:
Posthumously received the Richard H. Johnson Technical Achievement Award from the Precision Strike Association at the PSA Technical Symposium in October 2009. This award was created in his name to recognize an individual from the public or private sector for outstanding personal technical achievement resulting in significant contribution to precision strike systems. The PSA's documentation for this award indicates that "Dick Johnson personally led the design or redesign of more precision strike airframes than any contemporary. In a number of conflicts over the past two decades, the majority of weapon airframes were Johnson's designs. His innovative designs, or copies of them, appear in nearly every nation's military where precision strike systems are employed."

Maguire v SOCOG 2000

Maguire v SOCOG 2000 was a legal case in Australia about making a website accessible to a visually impaired person.
Complaint.
On 7 June 1999, Maguire made a complaint to the human rights and equal opportunity commission (HREOC), alleging that SOCOG had discriminated against him on the grounds of disability, in contravention of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 in three aspects: the failure to provide braille copies of the information required to place orders for Olympic Games tickets; the failure to provide braille copies of the
Olympic Games souvenir programme; and the failure to provide a web site which was accessible to Maguire. Following the completion of the ticket book case ("Maguire v SOCOG 1999" ) on 30 September 1999, conciliation on the remaining matters was attempted but by 29 November 1999, the talks failed.
Maguire v SOCOG 2000 (HREOC).
Maguire v Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission), No. H 99/115, 11 August 2000 (hearing), 24 August 2000 (decision). The commissioner, on 25 February 2000, notified the two parties about resuming the inquiry on 27 March 2000. On that day 27 March, SOCOG in a direction conference agreed to provide the Souvenir programme would be available to Maguire in braille.
Seeking Information.
From 27 March 2000 to 4 August 2000, several direction conferences and letters from Maguire's solicitor to SOCOG solicitor asking SOCOG to provide information in order for Mr Worthington and Ms Treviranus who are experts in computers and adaptive technology to complete their assessment did not result in the experts receiving the complete amount of information. In providing Mr Worthington and Ms Treviranus with incomplete information, SOCOG maintained that the html source code was commercially sensitive to SOCOG and its contractor IBM.
The complete information that was sought was"a sample page in electronic format from the proposed Results Table on the SOCOG website relating to the Olympic Games and the Paralympic website (the latter request was abandoned upon advice by SOCOG that it was not involved in the organisation of the Paralympic Games); the current content plan for the Olympic website;the number of templates to be used; the details of the tools used to generate the pages of the Olympic website; and detailed calculations of certain "ball park" figures."
Jurisdiction.
At the 3 July hearing, SOCOG presented the amended legislation effective from 13 April 2000 that transferred complaint hearing powers from HREOC to the Federal Court. The commissioner felt that the amendment did not apply because of 31 August 1999 directions. SOCOG sought Federal Court review of the commissioner's ruling, but on 3 August 2000, the Federal court dismissed the case.
Number of complaints.
A witness statement submitted on 1 May 2000 confirmed that Maguire went to SOCOG's website on 17 April 2000 who found some changes to the website but some other areas remained inaccessible. The witness statement asked for 
"That SOCOG include ALT text on all images and image map links on the website; That SOCOG ensure access from the Schedule page to the Index of Sports; and That SOCOG ensure access to the Results Tables on the web site during the Olympic Games." . SOCOG used this statement to argue that the April 2000 complaint was different to the June 1999 complaint. The commissioner maintained that SOCOG's website was inaccessible and did not meet the W3C guidelines on accessibility. It was noted that SOCOG on 27 July 2000 provided Maguire information of urel addresses of each of the 37 individual sport to access the index of sports from the schedule. Even though the original complaint was broad which was then particularised for the three areas, the commissioner felt the April 2000 and the June 1999 complaints were the same.
Service.
SOCOG argued that the promotional material of the website fell outside of the DDA 1992 definition of "service". The commissioner declared that the provision of information fell inside Section 4 definition of "service" which made Section 24 valid., and 
Treated Less Favourably.
SOCOG put forward that there was no direct discrimination as Maguire in using the website was not treated less favourably than a sighted person. The incompletion of adding ALT texts and an imperfect mode access that should not be attempted by a sighted person were reasons that led the commissioner to find that SOCOG in providing services in a manner accessible to sighted persons but inaccessible or partially accessible to a blind person breached section 5 and 24 of DDA 1992 and. In addition, the commissioner found that SOCOG breached Section 6 by imposing a requirement that Maguire should be able to read print, where a substantially higher proportion of persons without Maguire's disability was able to comply.
Unjustifiable hardship.
SOCOG said that it did not unlawfully discriminate against Maguire but if it did, that the cost and effort in retraining staff and redrawing entire development methodology was an unjustifiable hardship in providing an accessible website. and SOCOG argued that the Table of Results is made up of data sourced from a number of different databases of results for each of 37 sporting disciplines; the site currently consists of 6,000 pages and approximately 55,000 pages will be generated in the course of the Games; there are 37 sports web page templates each with approximately 35 result templates - in total 1,295 templates for results alone; the tables of results will contain "wrapped text within cells"; there will be approximately 6 billion "hits" on the site and the site needs to be fast and highly responsive; to reformat the site and its contents in a way which will make the web site accessible to the complainant will in effect require the development of a new or separate site; extensive changes to infrastructure are required; there is a requirement for specialised skills which are limited and expensive; there will be possible adverse impacts upon the support and maintenance systems; one person working 8 hour business days would require 368 days to complete the task properly; $2.2 million of additional infrastructure would be required to separately host the additional designs necessary to an accessible Table of Results. On the other hand, Maguire with expert witnesses argued that the number of templates is significantly less than 1295 and the reformatting of the templates will take considerably less than the 2 hours for each
alleged by SOCOG ; a more realistic estimate for the minor changes required is 10 minutes each; nor is there the need for unique manually generated formats; no new infrastructure will be required because it is allegedly in place; a team of one experienced developer with a group of 5-10 assistants could provide an accessible site to Level A compliance in 4 weeks; wrapping in each cell can be met by using a simple device namely the inclusion of an invisible end of cell character which would indicate to a blind person the end of the text in each cell; the cost of making the site accessible is a modest amount; the number of templates has been estimated at 357 for 28 sports. Additional templates would be required for 37. Because of the failure of respondent to supply the information requested by letter on 31 March 2000 the number of templates has been estimated. The expert witnesses of Maguire who provided months of advice convinced the commissioner more than the expert witnesses of SOCOG who provided days of advice just before the August hearing. Despite conflicting arguments stated above, the Commissioner found that SOCOG who had unlawfully discriminated in breach of the DDA, delayed the final determination of that complaint of the commissioner and took advantage of matters consequential upon that delay in order to support its alleged inability to cure its problem.
Final decision.
The Commissioner found that SOCOG had engaged in unlawful discrimination against Maguire in breach of Section 24 of the DDA 1992. SOCOG was ordered to render its website accessible including ALT text on all images and image map links on its web site; providing access to the Index of Sports from the Schedule page; and providing access to the Results Tables to be used on the web site during the Sydney Olympic Games by 15 September 2000. Failure on SOCOG's part to comply with that order would give Maguire the option to press for compensation.
Bruce Lindsay Maguire v. Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games 2000 HREOC.
Bruce Lindsay Maguire v. Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (Respondent) (HREOC) H 99/115, DATE OF HEARING: 6 November 2000, DATE OF EX TEMPORE DECISION: 6 November 2000, DATE OF WRITTEN REASONS: 18 November 2000. The Commissioner found that SOCOG only partially complied and as a result, under section 103(1)(b)(iv) of the DDA,the commissioner awarded Maguire $20000.
Case Significance.
Australian governments have decided to adopt the W3C Guidelines, with the Commonwealth Government requiring all agency web sites to pass accessibility tests by 1 December 2000. 
It is questionable what tests are to be complied with, and what level of compliance would be required. Since this case there been greater scrutiny in relations to the accessibility of subsequent Olympic Games websites. Peter Coroneos from the Internet Industry Association warned businesses that the SOGOC decision puts them on notice as the decision confirmed that the DDA applied to online services and that Australian sites targeting overseas customers may be liable under equivalent legislation.

Welles Crowther

Welles Remy Crowther (May 17, 1977 – September 11, 2001) was an equities trader known for saving at least a dozen lives during the September 11 attacks in New York City, during which he lost his own life.
Early life.
Welles Remy Crowther was born the first of three children. His parents, Jefferson and Allison, raised him and his two younger sisters, Honor and Paige, in the northern New York suburb of Nyack, New York. As a child, Crowther looked up to his father, and one day, while seeing his father meticulously getting dressed for church, noticed that his father putting a white handkerchief in his breast pocket of his suit coat and then wrap a small comb in a blue or red bandanna and stick it in his right hip pocket. When he was six years old, Jefferson gave Welles a red bandanna that would become a signature trademark and a link between father and son, that he would carry with him everywhere, wearing one under all of his sports uniforms in high school, always as #19. Crowther joined his father as a volunteer firefighter at age 16, becoming a junior member of the Empire Hook and Ladder Company. He later attended Boston College, where he played lacrosse, wearing his bandana under his helmet. In 1999 Crowther graduated with honors with a degree in economics. He subsequently moved to New York City, taking a job as an equities trader for Sandler O'Neill and Partners, settling into an office on the 104th floor of South Tower of the World Trade Center. Though Crowther had long-aspired to be in business, he eventually came to dislike desk work, and entertained dreams of joining the FDNY or the FBI or CIA.
September 11 attacks.
On September 11, 2001, minutes after United Airlines Flight 175 struck the South Tower between the 77th and 85th floors, the 24-year-old Crowther called his mother from his office at 9:12 a.m., calmly leaving a brief message saying, "Mom, this is Welles. I want you to know that I'm okay." Crowther made his way down to the 78th floor sky lobby, where he encountered a group of survivors, huddled and waiting for help, including a badly burned Ling Young, who worked on the 86th floor in New York's Department of Taxation and Finance. Young had been one of approximately 200 people waiting at a bank of elevators to evacuate when the plane hit the tower, and one of the few survivors. Blinded by the blood covering her glasses, she was rescued when Crowther appeared, carrying a young woman on his back, and directed them in a strong, authoritative voice, to the stairway, where the survivors followed him fifteen floors down, where he dropped off the woman he was carrying before heading back upstairs to assist others. By the time he returned to the 78th floor, he had a bandana around his nose and mouth to protect him from smoke and haze. He found another group of survivors, which included AON Corp. employee Judy Wein, who worked on the 103rd floor, and was in pain from a broken arm, cracked ribs and a punctured lung. According to Wein, Crowther assisted in putting out fires and administering first aid. He then announced to that group, "Everyone who can stand, stand now. If you can help others, do so." He directed this group downstairs as well. "If he hadn't come back, I wouldn't have made it," said Wein. "People can live 100 years and not have the compassion, the wherewithal to do what he did." As occupants of the Tower headed for the street, Crowther turned around and went back inside multiple times, according to witnesses. He was last seen doing so with members of the FDNY before the South Tower collapsed at 9:59 a.m. 
Crowther's body was found on March 19, 2002, alongside several firefighters and emergency workers bunched in a suspected command post in the South Tower lobby. Allison Crowther related that the New York medical examiner's office told them her son's body was found intact, with no signs of burns, and that authorities speculated that he was aiding the rescue effort as a civilian usher when the building collapsed. Crowther's family were unaware of the exact details of Crowther's activities between his last phone call to his mother and his death until Allison Crowther read Judy Wein's firsthand account in "The New York Times", of being saved by a man in a red bandana, which led to Allison meeting with the people that Welles had saved, including Wein and Young, who confirmed from photographs the identity of the man who aided them. According to survivor accounts, Crowther saved as many as 12 people following the attacks. His mother commented, "We took great peace in knowing that didn't suffer and that, up until the end, he was being very courageous, doing what he wanted to do. So he must have felt very fulfilled that day, knowing he was helping others." Jefferson Crowther said of his son, "He didn't live long enough to be head of a corporation or do good works or endow a museum. But what he did on September 11, that's his legacy."
Legacy.
The Welles Remy Crowther Red Bandana Run, a 5 kilometer road race, is held annually at Boston College.
In 2006 Crowther was posthumously named an honorary New York City firefighter by Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta.
That same year, Crowther's Boston College lacrosse teammate, Tyler Jewell, wore a red bandana in honor of Crowther when he competed as a member of the United States snowboarding team in the 2006 Winter Olympics.
At the National 9/11 Memorial, Crowther is memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-50.
During the September 10, 2011, Central Florida-Boston College football game in Orlando, Florida, a day before the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, both schools honored Crowther, with Boston College players wearing helmet stickers featuring Crowther's signature red bandana during the game, and Crowther's sisters, Honor Fagan and Paige Crowther, introduced to the crowd during the third quarter. Boston College Athletic Director Gene DeFilippo had stated two days earlier, "Welles Crowther is a true American hero and we are very proud that he was a Boston College student-athlete. As Americans reflect in the upcoming days on the solemn occasion of the 9/11 anniversary, we are humbled by the bravery Welles exhibited that day." Several students at Central Florida were inspired by ESPN's "Outside the Lines" story about Crowther to encourage fans to wear red bandanas as they entered the stadium the night of the game.

Siege of Hostalric

The Siege of Hostalric was the first major action of the War Against John II. It took place on 23 May 1462. 
Background.
In 1460, after John II imprisoned Charles of Viana, the Catalans at the Corts de Lleida formed the Consell del Principat in opposition to the government of John in Catalonia. The Consell demanded that John liberate Charles immediately and accept the Capitulation of Vilafranca, which prohibited John from entering Catalonia without the permission of the Generalitat so long as he disagreed with their legislation. John capitulated. 
The subsequent death of Charles only three weeks after his liberation threatened the peace. The king sent his wife, Joana Enríquez, to Barcelona with the intention of overturning the capitulation and sowing discord among the Catalan factions. The relationship between the queen and the representatives of the Catalan government was strained during the six months she was in Barcelona with her son, Charles' successor as heir, Ferdinand. In March 1462 the queen and the prince left for Girona, while the "pagesos de remença" revolted against the government in hopes of receiving royal support and abolishing the "mals usos". 
Leadup to battle.
At Girona the queen convoked a general council on 23 April 1462. She reorganised the citizen militia and proceeded to repair the city's walls and towers. On 12 May she sent a force of 200 men to Bernat Joan de Cabrera, head of the garrison of Hostalric. On 13 May the Consell del Principat sent an ambassador to the castle to assure that the council's army, which was marching on Girona, would be well received. 
In a final preparation for battle, Joana sealed an alliance with the leader of the "remences", Francesc de Verntallat. The rebels agreed to bar the pass of the Consell's army at Hostalric, while Joana sent 600 men to reinforce the "remences". A ship of arms and food was sent to Sant Feliu de Guíxols to gain time as the "remences" organised themselves. 
Siege.
The army of the Consell was commanded by captain Pere de Bell-lloc i de Sentmenat. After easily frightening the "remences" of Verntallat into retreat on 23 May, Pere besieged Hostalric. The "remences" fled to Girona. 
To impress upon the town the urgency of surrender, Pere began destroying the surrounding vineyards and wheat fields. The townspeople opened the gates to the Consell and the town fell without a fight. The castle too was surrendered without combat, but the Tower of Friars, defended by a single man, was attacked by the crossbowmen. Bernat Joan de Cabrera was taken prisoner. On 29 May the Consell sent the remainder of their army stationed at Barcelona to besiege Girona. Hostalric remained a stronghold of the Consell until the end of the war.

Society of Experimental Psychologists

The Society of Experimental Psychologists (SEP), originally called the Society of Experimentalists, is an academic society for experimental psychologists. It was founded by Edward Bradford Titchener in 1904 to be an ongoing workshop in which members could visit labs, study apparatus, and hear and comment on reports of ongoing research. Upon Titchener’s death in 1927 the club was reorganized and renamed the Society of Experimental Psychologists. The object of the society is “To advance psychology by arranging informal conferences on experimental psychology.” 
The SEP meets annually to conduct plenary sessions in which members can present papers. It holds meetings every spring, scheduled by a member at the host university who serves as the chair of the SEP for that year. The meetings are open to all members and to students and faculty from the host university who are invited by the chair.
Membership in the SEP is by invitation only and is considered to be a great honor because it represents significant accomplishment in the field of experimental psychology. The SEP currently admits at least 6 new members annually from among the leading experimentalists in North America. It has a current membership of 220 individuals, about 5 - 10% of the practicing experimental psychologists.
The SEP confers three awards:

Since 1999, Méryl Marchetti founds in Pau the group “La Travarde” where he criticizes the form collection and invents other modes of organization of the corpora of poems such as the play-of-tanks, circles polypoetic (or game piece). For him the collection exerts the spirit of synthesis of its reader, whereas the play-of-tanks suggests an inner struggle. An essential characteristic is that there is no pre-arranged sequence of poems, therefore, play-of-tanks have elements of improvisation. Through the French Group of new education and the festival of Uzeste it joined very quickly the Ligne Imaginot.

List of Hatzolah chapters

This is a list of Hatzolah chapters. Hatzolah is an all volunteer Emergency medical services organization staffed by Jewish Orthodox Emergency medical technicians and Paramedics. Locations where chapters are situated are listed alphabetically by geography.
Each neighborhood or city in Hatzalah operates independently. There are some exceptions, where there is a tight affiliation with neighboring Hatzolahs, a loose affiliation of neighboring Hatzolahs, or some other basic level of cooperation.
Israel.
Each of the organizations has many local chapters, close to 1,000 volunteers apiece, and provides coordinated response for larger emergencies or extra coverage across multiple localities.
Mexico.
Chevra Hatzalah Mexico was founded in 1997 by Mr. Chaim Silver. The branch is run by the Syrian-Sephardic community under supervision of Mr. Abraham Levy who is the CEO. It has 70 full-time volunteers, seven ambulances and six locations (five bases and a headquarters). It also has access to a helicopter and air transport. All dispatchers are Volunteer EMS for immediate intervention and instructions, some of them certified in Advanced Critical Care Medicine and Emergency response, actually working for prestigious Mexican Hospitals and National Medical Centers. Volunteers have plenty of experience in Trauma and Internal Medicine emergencies, having training in the Mexican Red Cross´s Ambulance Center. The branch covers the Jewish areas of Tecamachalco, Bosques, Polanco, Interlomas, and the weekend resort city Cuernavaca. It has full-time operating bases in three major Jewish areas, having its Central Base in Tecamachalco, a dense populated Jewish area in Mexico City.
United States.
California.
Los Angeles has a chapter which provides Basic life support level care and relies on the Los Angeles Fire Department for Advanced life support paramedic care and transport.. On August 31, 2009 they began direct transport of patients to area hospitals using their own ambulance.
Connecticut.
The Orthodox community in Waterbury, CT, centered around the yeshiva there, has its own Hatzolah.
Florida.
Since January 2010, Miami-Dade has a chapter that provides Basic life support response and relies on Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department Miami Beach Fire Rescue Department for Advanced life support paramedic care and transport.
Illinois.
Hatzalah Chicago provides first responder coverage for Lincolnwood, Peterson Park, Skokie, and West Rogers Park. It does not do transports.
Hatzalah of Chicago purchased 2 ambulances and they now transport.
Maryland.
Baltimore started a Hatzalah in 2007 as a first-responder-only service with transport to be done by Baltimore City ambulance units. Currently, Hatzalah of Baltimore does provide Advanced Life Support (ALS) services to the Northwest Baltimore community provided it is in their response area.
New Jersey.
New Jersey has many Hatzolah organizations throughout the State. Each NJ affiliate maintains its own emergency phone number, dispatchers, and radio frequencies. While they are not officially connected, as with NYC Hatzolah, many of them are nevertheless loosely affiliated, sharing classes or working at each other's events. On occasion, all five divisions have worked together to provide joint event coverage or to share training classes.
Per New Jersey law, volunteers with proper permits may equip their cars with blue flashing lights and electronic airhorns, but not red flashing lights, nor sirens. Coordinators' ("officers'") personal vehicles, and any vehicle owned by a squad with a 'No Fee' license plate, are permitted the use of red flashing lights and sirens; not all branches make use of these allowances. Paramedic (ALS) units in New Jersey are only run by hospitals, per state law. The limitation to BLS is not just for Hatzolah and other volunteer agencies: all New Jersey "911" municipal-run EMS services are also limited to BLS. However, see Lakewood below for a special exception.
Hatzalah of Union County, with "U-prefix" unit numbers. Union County is geographically and organizationally separate from Union City. With three active ambulances, "the U" also responds to nearby towns including Linden, Union Township, Roselle and Roselle Park, and even to businesses in Newark where slow EMS response may allow the Hatzalah ambulance to complete the 12-14 minute trip from Elizabeth or Hillside before a Newark city crew arrives. Hatzalah of Union County also covers the Jersey Gardens Mall, Newark Liberty Airport, and nearby stretches of the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway. Two ambulances are located in the greater Elizabeth/Hillside area and the third is located in Roselle.
The largest branch in New Jersey, with "L-prefix" unit numbers. Unique to New Jersey, Lakewood has a Paramedic (ALS) unit. The ALS unit is owned and run by MONOC, but the Paramedics are also Lakewood Hatzolah members, and the ambulance was donated by Hatzolah Lakewood to MONOC. This unusual arrangement meets New Jersey's strict hospital-based ALS rules, while giving Hatzolah its own ALS coverage. Also unique, Lakewood has its own Rescue (extrication) unit.
Hatzolah of Passaic/Clifton EMS. The neighboring cities have a contiguous Orthodox Jewish community, with most of the community and its institutions on the Passaic side. Likewise, Hatzolah of Passaic/Clifton, with "P-prefix" unit numbers, covers both parts of the community, but is primarily based in Passaic, with some members and management in Clifton. This Hatzolah is geographically near Union City, and can provide extra coverage for them. Hatzolah of Passaic/Clifton has 30 active members, 20 dispatchers, two active ambulances and a third on standby, for a community of about 2,000 households.
Hatzolah of Union City http://www.hatzolahuc.com/, is run out of Mosded Sanz-Zviel, which is the center of the Chasidic community in Union City. It is the only Chasidic Hatzolah in New Jersey. Union City is located in Hudson County, and is not related to Union County. Union City uses VHF radios, while all other New Jersey chapters use UHF radios.
New York.
Canarsie/Mill Basin<br>
The Canarsie/Mill Basin chapter was originally just the Canarsie division. As the Canarsie Orthodox neighborhood declined, and the Mill Basin one grew, Canarsie started taking more calls and members from nearby Mill Basin, and is now primarily a Mill Basin operation. Canarsie/Mill Basin also covers nearby Georgetown. There are parts of the Brooklyn neighborhood of Mill Basin that border Madison/Midwood/East Midwood, so there is some overlap in coverage with Flatbush.
Catskill Mountains<br>
This chapter is part of Central Hatzalah of New York City. While the Catskills have a year-round operation, the vast majority of their activity is in July and August, when summer residents arrive.
Fleischmanns
Kiryas Joel
Monroe, NY<br>
The Chasidic community in Kiryas Joel (Monroe), NY has a chapter. Uniquely, it operates separately from all other New York State Hatzolah organizations.
New Square<br>
This chapter is a breakoff from the Rockland Hatzoloh chapter. Uniquely, the chapter has female Certified First Responders who respond to calls involving obstetrics related emergencies.
New York City Central<br>
This chapter has sixteen local divisions which share rabbinic counsel, radio frequencies, central dispatch and lobbying, but have separate fundraising and management. Catskills, the Five Towns, and Yonkers are the only areas outside of New York City covered by NYC chapters.
The chapter has a central dispatching network with teams of 2 volunteer dispatchers working in tandem. Each dispatch team works several hours on a shift. The chapter also uses a mobile command center for dealing with large events.
New York City chapters include Boro Park, Canarsie/Mill Basin, Crown Heights, Flatbush, Lower East Side, Midtown, Queens, Richmond, Riverdale, Rockaways/Lawrence, Seagate, Staten Island, Upper East Side, Upper West Side, Washington Heights, and Williamsburg.
Rockland County
This chapter is unaffiliated with the New York Central Hatzolah. It has distinct rabbinical oversight primarily due to several large Hasidic communities affiliated with Rockland Hatzolah.
Westchester County
Pennsylvania.
Philadelphia's Hatzolah has limited service, providing first responder aid only in the Northeast area. Hatzolah of Philadelphia transports are provided by calling in either Patriot Ambulance, or, when the situation warrants, 9-1-1. Patriot Ambulance is a local paid ambulance service owned by a community member. Its owner has also provided Philadelphia Hatzolah with financial assistance, training, and medical guidance to ensure excellence and continuity in patient care. Philadelphia has nine responders, all state certified. Some members are full-time professional EMTs or Paramedics.

William Hudson (actor)

William Woodson Hudson Jr. (January 24, 1925 - April 5, 1974) was an American actor best remembered for the role of Ranger Clark in "Rocky Jones, Space Ranger" and the role of Special Agent Mike Andrews in the Emmy Award nominated spy drama "I Led Three Lives".
History.
After appearing uncredited in over a dozen movies Hudson got his break in 1951's "Hard, Fast and Beautiful". He appeared in a few other movies and TV shows before being cast as Special Agent Mike Andrews in "I Led Three Lives". In 1954, while also still doing "I Led Three Lives", Hudson was cast in the television serial "Rocky Jones, Space Ranger" as Ranger Clark. After his stint as Clark on "Rocky Jones" Hudsons parts started to be more in the genres of Science fiction, Fantasy, and Monster movies, especially the latter with starring roles in such films as "The She Creature", "The Amazing Colossal Man" and, perhaps most famously, as the husband in 1958's cult classic "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman". In 1964 he was cast as the doomed first Captain of the Seaview, John Phillips, in the pilot episode of "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea". In 1965 he was back on "Voyages" as a different character in an episode infamous among fans of the series due to its heavy use of archive footage from the pilot episode (specifically a scene with Hudson and Richard Basehart leaving the Nelson Institute, being chased and attacked by a helicopter and which ended with the death of Hudsons character and the car going off a cliff aflame) giving him the dubious honour of being the only person "killed" on that show twice. In 1966 he was cast as a reporter in the second part of the first Television appearance of Mr. Freeze in a first season episode of "Batman" titled "Rats Like Cheese". From then on he had several small parts in various movies and TV shows, his last part being Mr. Dunn in 1971's "How's Your Love Life?".
He died at age 49 on April 5, 1974 in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California from cirrhosis. He was survived by his older brother, actor John Hudson.

Dorian Gray (2009 film)

Dorian Gray is a 2009 British fantasy-thriller drama film based on Oscar Wilde's 1890 novel "The Picture of Dorian Gray".
This version is directed by Oliver Parker, written by Toby Finlay (his first screenplay), and stars Ben Barnes as Dorian Gray and Colin Firth as Lord Henry Wotton. The film tells the story of the titular character Dorian Gray, an attractive Englishman whose image is captured in an enchanted painting that keeps him from ageing. For every sin he commits, his image in the portrait ages and loses his beauty.
The film, which was released in the United Kingdom on 9 September 2009, competed in the Official Fantàstic Competition at the 2009 Sitges – Catalonian International Film Festival.
Plot.
When a naïve young Dorian Gray arrives in a train to Edwardian London, to inherit an estate left to him by his abusive Grandfather, he is swept into a social whirlwind by the charismatic Lord Henry Wotton, who introduces Gray to the hedonistic pleasures of the city. Lord Henry's friend, society artist Basil Hallward, paints a portrait of Gray to capture the full power of his youthful beauty. When the portrait is unveiled, Gray makes a flippant pledge: he would give anything to stay as he is in the picture—even his soul. 
Gray meets and falls in love with young budding actress Sibyl Vane. After a few weeks, he proposes marriage to her, but after Lord Henry tells Gray that having children is "the beginning of the end", he takes Gray to a brothel. This breaks Sibyl's heart as Gray leaves her, and she drowns herself soon after. Gray learns of this next day from her brother James ("Jim"), who tells Gray that Sybil was pregnant. Jim then tries to kill Gray before being restrained and carried off by the authorities. Gray's initial grief disappears as Lord Henry persuades him that all events are mere experiences and without consequence, and his hedonistic lifestyle worsens, distancing him from a concerned Hallward. 
Gray goes home to find the portrait of himself warped and twisted and realises that his pledge has come true; while the portrait ages, its owner's sins are shown as physical defects on the canvas. The chaos of the portrait of Gray starts, leading him to brutally kill Hallward after telling him his secret, dumping the body in the River Thames.
Having left London to travel for many years, Gray returns to London and during the welcome-back party the guests are surprised to see that he has not aged at all. He becomes close to Lord Henry's daughter, Emily, a member of the UK suffragette movement, despite Lord Henry's distaste for such a relationship due to Gray's lifestyle and unnatural appearance, Emily having provided Lord Henry with a greater moral focus.
Although Gray appears genuinely interested in changing his ways as he spends time with Emily, matters are complicated when he is confronted by Jim, still seeking revenge for his sister's death. Despite Gray's attempts to pretend to be someone else by pointing out his apparent age, Jim nevertheless deduces Gray's true identity, only to be killed by a train while pursuing Gray in the London Underground. As Gray makes arrangements to leave London with Emily, Lord Henry's study of old photographs makes him remember the time when he teased Gray to deal with the devil for eternal youth and beauty at the cost of his soul.
Breaking into Gray's house as Gray and Emily are making plans to leave together, Lord Henry discovers the concealed portrait, but is interrupted by Gray before he can uncover it. Although Gray attempts to convince Lord Henry that he still cherishes his friendship and genuinely loves his daughter, Lord Henry discovers a stained scarf of Basil's in a box, prompting Gray to angrily declare that he is what Lord Henry has made him, the personification of the life he preached but never dared practice. Full of anger and grief, Gray attempts to strangle Lord Henry, but is distracted by Emily's call long enough for Lord Henry to knock him aside and expose the portrait.
Disgusted and horrified at the twisted sight on the canvas, Lord Henry throws a lit lamp at the portrait, causing it to catch fire, subsequently locking the gate of the attic, to ensure Gray and the painting are destroyed, before his daughter sees the ruckus as she pleads with Gray for the key. Gray, after seeing her and realising that he really loves her, turns his back as Lord Henry drags his daughter out of the house, his last words being to assure Emily that she has his whole heart. Resolving to end it all, Gray stabs the painting with a poker, causing his body to age the years that it has never suffered, Gray charging at the portrait to fully impale it as his years catch up to him before the attic is consumed by an explosion.
A few months later, scarred from the explosion and after attempting to reconcile with Emily through Agatha over the phone, Lord Henry heads to his attic where he keeps the now-youthful portrait of Gray, grimly noting that nobody will look at it now. As Lord Henry leaves, the portrait's eyes glow, suggesting that Gray's soul may still be within the portrait even after his death.
Cast.
Supporting parts are played by Pip Torrens as Victor, Gray's valet; Jo Woodcock as Lord and Lady Radley's daughter Celia; Max Irons as Lucius, a young man whom Gray assaults at a party for touching the key to the attic door; David Sterne as the theatre manager who first introduces Gray to Sibyl; and Douglas Henshall as Alan Campbell, an acquaintance of Gray's who is present when Jim Vane tries to strangle Gray.
Production.
The film began shooting in summer 2008 at Ealing Studios and locations across London and wrapped in October. The film received £500,000 of National Lottery funding via the UK Film Council's Premiere Fund.
Reception.
The film received mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes, the film reviews aggregator, gave the film 42% based on critics' opinions. Most of the negative reviews are based on the acting and of the story not following the original plot of the book.

Hui'an maidens

Hui'an maidens or Hui'an women () are a group of women residing in Hui'an County of Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China. They are Han Chinese, but trace their origins to the ancient Minyue people more than two thousand years ago. The isolation on the eastern peninsula of Hui'an prevented Hui'an maidens from assimilating into the Han culture, so many of their distinctive customs and traditions still survive today.
Hui'an maidens are also well known for their hard work and kindness. They indefatigably "do most of the farmwork, road repair, and family chores while their husbands are at sea".
Culture.
Costumes.
Typical Hui'an maidens wear short cyan jackets and skintight black hip huggers which flare out baggily at the legs and leave their bellies bare, but they fastidiously cover their heads with colorful scarves and conical hats. Thus they are jokingly said to have "feudal heads, thrifty jackets, democratic bellies, and wasteful trousers".
The Hui'an maidens' distinctive costumes can be found in some other southern Chinese minority groups. For example, their conical hats are similar to the Li and Jing people's, and their short tight jackets bear much resemblance to those of the Dai people in Xishuangbanna. On traditional festivals, Hui'an maidens pull their hair into a knot which looks like a butterfly, which was one of the totems of ancient Minyue. All these are regarded as evidences that they are descendants of the ancient Baiyue.
Marriage.
Hui'an maidens have very distinct customs regarding their marriage. Newlyweds are not allowed to stay together on their wedding night, so the groom stays in a friend's house. On the second day, the bride pays respects to the groom's family and gives gifts to the elders. On the third day, the groom's sister leads the bride to the communal well to draw two buckets of water. After five days of obeying various customs, she returns to her parents' home. Bride and groom are forbidden to live together or even talk to each other until the bride bears a child.
In recent years, however, Hui'an maidens have had more contact with the outside world and they have been influenced by the marriage law. For these reasons, younger generations today refuse to obey old marital customs.
Society.
Historically, women were not educated at school, and the society of Hui'an was patriarchal despite the notably (compared to the rest of China) significant role of women in the labour force.
Religion.
The majority of Hui'an people, including Hui'an maidens, subscribe to a combination of the three teachings (Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism) and Chinese folk religion); however, some are adherents of Christianity.

Klaarkamp Abbey

Klaarkamp Abbey (; ) was a Cistercian monastery in the community of Dongeradeel, about 4 kilometres southwest of Dokkum and 2 kilometres north of Rinsumageast in the Dutch province of Friesland.
History.
The abbey was founded in either 1163 or 1165, either directly from Clairvaux Abbey in France, which is the more generally accepted account, or from Riddagshausen Abbey near Braunschweig, in which case Klaarkamp was of the filiation of Morimond. The abbey's daughter houses were Bloomkamp Abbey (founded 1190 near Bolsward), Aduard Abbey (founded 1192) and Gerka Abbey (founded 1240 near Buitenpost). The monastery was engaged in brick production from the clay on its land, and employed hundreds of lay brothers in this work.
The abbey's main estates were in Janum, Sibrandahûs, Feanwâlden and on the island of Schiermonnikoog. It also owned a grange at "Betterwird", apparently in Westdongeradeel.
During the Reformation battles of the Eighty Years' War Friesland converted to Protestantism and secularised all its religious houses. On 31 May 1580 the abbey was dissolved and its assets confiscated by the state of Friesland. The buildings were sold off and demolished. In the 19th and early 20th centuries the mound, about 4 metres high, on which the monastery had stood was removed, and some excavation took place at that time.
Premises and buildings.
Nothing remains of the abbey buildings. The site is marked by a monolith.

John Kinzie Clark

John Kinzie Clark (1792–1865) was a trader, trapper and a prominent early settler in the Chicago area. He was raised by Native Americans, who called him "Nonimoa" or Prairie Wolf. Clark first arrived at Fort Dearborn in 1818. In 1830, Clark settled in the vicinity of today's Jefferson Park area where he built a log cabin on the prairie. Hired to carry mail by horseback between Chicago and Milwaukee, he would make stops in Deerfield with provisions for early settlers there. Clark eventually moved to Deerfield, where he is buried at the Deerfield Cemetery.
Prairie Wolf Slough, a forest preserve in Deerfield, Illinois just north of Deerfield High School is named for Clark using his Native American name.

Isles of Scilly Football League

The Isles of Scilly Football League is the official football league for the Isles of Scilly. The football league is reportedly the smallest in the world, with only two clubs.
The league is affiliated with The Football Association.
History.
In the 1920s, the Lyonnesse Inter-Island Cup, a competition between the islands of St. Mary's, Tresco, St. Martins, Bryher and St. Agnes, was formed. By the 1950s, only two clubs remained - the Rangers and the Rovers. In 1984 the two clubs changed their names to the Garrison Gunners and the Woolpack Wanderers, which are their current names.
The League is attempting to get into the Guinness World Records for the smallest league in the world.
In April 2008, Adidas ran an advertisement called "Dream Big", highlighting the league, featuring several well-known football personnel including David Beckham, Steven Gerrard and Patrick Vieira.
Competition structure.
The League competition involves the Woolpack Wanderers and the Garrison Gunners playing each other every Sunday seventeen times. There also exist two Cups: The Wholesalers Cup and the Foredeck Cup, which is played over two legs. An "Old Men versus the Youngsters" match is played on Boxing Day. The season itself starts with the Charity Shield. All the matches are played on the Garrison football field, on the island of St. Mary's.
The league is played during the winter, from mid-November until the end of March.
Occasionally, a combined Scilly Isles team play a team Newlyn Non Athletico, a team at level 14 of the English football league system. A team from Truro visits annually to play against a combined team.
Honours.
The Woolpack Wanderers have won the Charity Cup 5 times - in 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. In addition, they have won the Lioness Shield twice - in 2006 and 2007.
The Garrison Gunners have won the Lioness Shield once, in 2005.
Concerns.
The Isles of Scilly are struggling to hold on to their young people. There is no sixth form on the Isles so when youngsters turn 16, they go to the mainland. In addition, house prices are expensive, so they tend not to return until much older. As a result, the number of players in the league is dwindling. Howard Cole, a secretary who referees the games, estimated the average age of both teams to be within the mid- to late-30s.

<doc id="19308812" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19308812" title="List of highways in Hamilton County, New York">
List of highways in Hamilton County, New York

The highway system of Hamilton County, New York, comprises of roads maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), the county, and its towns and villages. NYSDOT maintains five state touring routes in Hamilton County, which account for a combined of New York's state highway mileage. These five routes are supplemented by Hamilton County's county route system, which comprises 25 roads of varying length and importance. The system, maintained by the Hamilton County Department of Public Works, connects the state routes to a number of small hamlets and other points of interest.
Hamilton County's five state routes are spread throughout the county, which is the least populated in the state of New York. The routes are NY 8, NY 10, NY 28, NY 28N, and NY 30. The longest is NY 30, which extends for on a north–south alignment from the Fulton County line to the Franklin County line. The five state highways traverse highly rural sections of Adirondack Park; in fact, the only village along any of these roads is Speculator, located at the western junction of NY 8 and NY 30. NY 10 and NY 28 were assigned in 1924, while the others were assigned in 1930. NY 365 once passed through the county; however, it was truncated southwestward to end in Oneida County in the late 1950s. Additionally, NY 10 extended north along modern NY 30 to the Canadian border until , when it was replaced with NY 30 north of Speculator. Since the truncation of NY 10, there have not been any substantial changes to roads in Hamilton County.
NY 8.
NY 8 is a state highway that is more than long. It stretches from Deposit in the Southern Tier to an intersection with NY 9N in Hague on the shores of Lake George. The stretch in Hamilton County is long, passing through mostly rural territory. NY 8 enters Hamilton County from Herkimer County west of Piseco and leaves the county for Warren County east of Wells. Along the way, NY 8 intersects the northern terminus of NY 10 in Arietta. The route is also one of two state routes to pass through the isolated village of Speculator; the other being NY 30. Speculator serves as the western endpoint of an overlap between NY 8 and NY 30, which extends for east to Wells. NY 8 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and has not been changed within Hamilton County since that time.
NY 10.
NY 10 is the shortest state route that traverses Hamilton County. At long, its only intersection in the county is its northern terminus at NY 8. NY 10 travels from the Fulton County line north of Caroga Lake to Arietta, where it ends at NY 8. The route passes through rural regions of Hamilton County and encounters no villages or noteworthy locations until Arietta. When NY 10 was first assigned in 1924, it entered the county from the east on modern NY 28N and left to the north on current NY 30. In the 1930 renumbering, NY 10 was realigned south of Long Lake to follow what is now NY 30 and NY 8 south to Arietta, from where it continued south to Fulton County on its modern routing. The resulting overlap with NY 8 was eliminated after NY 10 was replaced with an extended NY 30 north of Speculator.
NY 28.
NY 28 is a scenic, rural highway that runs for from the Herkimer County line northeast of the NY 12 intersection to the Warren County line near Blue Mountain Lake. Heading away from the western county line, NY 28 follows the Fulton Chain Lakes, which are numbered consecutively as the route and lakes continue northward. At Blue Mountain Lake, NY 28 and NY 30 become concurrent at an intersection that also serves as the western terminus of NY 28N, a suffixed route of NY 28. From here, NY 28 and NY 30 head to the southeast for over into Indian Lake, where NY 30 breaks from the route and heads southward. NY 28 was assigned in 1924, but was not extended into Hamilton County until the 1930 renumbering. Its number has remained unchanged within Hamilton County since that time.
NY 28N.
NY 28N, a suffixed route of NY 28, is the only state route that begins in the county itself. Only of its length is in Hamilton County, roughly 40 percent of the route's total across three counties. The route begins at an intersection with NY 28 and NY 30 at Blue Mountain Lake. Concurrent with the latter highway, NY 28N heads northward through mountainous parts of Hamilton County to Long Lake, where NY 30 splits and heads in the direction of Franklin County. From here, NY 28N heads eastward, passing some mountains before entering Essex County and continuing into Newcomb.
NY 28N was assigned as a suffixed route of the extended NY 28 in the 1930 renumbering. The concurrency that runs from Blue Mountain Lake to Long Lake was originally part of NY 10, which used to occupy all of modern NY 30 north of Speculator. When NY 10 was truncated , the highway became concurrent with NY 30 instead.
NY 30.
NY 30 stretches for within the county, making it the longest state highway in Hamilton County. NY 30 is one of two highways that enters a village in Hamilton County, the other being NY 8. The route overlaps three other state routes in Hamilton County: NY 8 near Speculator, NY 28 from Indian Lake to Blue Mountain Lake, and NY 28N from Blue Mountain Lake to Long Lake. NY 30 stretches from the Fulton County line north of Mayfield to the Franklin County line north of Long Lake and NY 28N.
Initially, NY 30 was not the longest state highway in Hamilton County. When it was assigned in the 1930 renumbering, NY 30 followed its current routing to Wells, where it terminated at NY 8. The remainder of modern NY 30 was part of NY 8 from Wells to Speculator and part of NY 10 from Speculator to the Canadian border. Ca. 1960, NY 10 was truncated south to Arietta, and NY 30 was extended northward to the Canadian border by way of NY 8 and NY 10's former routing.
Former routes.
Four other state routes once entered Hamilton County, but no longer do. Two of these routes—NY 80 and NY 365—were simply truncated out of the county, while two others—NY 10A and NY 54—no longer exist.
NY 10A.
NY 10A was a southerly alternate route of then-NY 10 between Long Lake and North Creek, Warren County, via Blue Mountain Lake. While NY 10 followed modern NY 28N between the two locations, NY 10A utilized what is now NY 30 and NY 28. It was assigned in the late 1920s and replaced by a realigned NY 10 and an extended NY 28 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.
NY 54.
NY 54 was a circuitous east–west route that extended from Utica, Oneida County, to Fonda, Montgomery County, via Speculator and Benson. It entered Hamilton County from Herkimer County on modern NY 8 and proceeded east through Speculator to Wells, where it turned south to follow what is now NY 30 to the Fulton County line. It was assigned in the mid-1920s and split into several routes, including NY 8 and NY 30, in the 1930 renumbering.
NY 80.
NY 80 originally continued much farther north than it does today. When it was assigned in the late 1920s, it continued north from Fort Plain, Montgomery County, to NY 54 in Arietta by way of modern NY 10. The Arietta – Fort Plain portion of NY 80 was replaced by a realigned NY 10 as part of the 1930 renumbering.
NY 365.
NY 365 is the only post-1930 state route that once entered Hamilton County, but no longer does. When it was assigned , the route entered Hamilton County from Herkimer County, overlapping with NY 28 until Blue Mountain Lake. Here, it turned off NY 28 and onto NY 10 (later NY 30) and NY 28N. The three routes overlapped to Long Lake, where NY 28N split off from both NY 10 and NY 365. The two highways continued northward, leaving Hamilton County and passing into Franklin County north of Long Lake. NY 365 was truncated in the late 1950s to end near the Oneida County village of Holland Patent, eliminating a series of overlaps between NY 365 and other state routes that collectively extended from Holland Patent to Plattsburgh, Clinton County.
County routes.
The Hamilton County Department of Public Works maintains a system of 25 county-designated highways, which make up almost of the county's highway system. The highest numbered route is CR 25, located in Hope, and the lowest numbered one is CR 1, which is located in Inlet. Most of the county routes serve as connectors to state routes or other county routes. Several end suddenly and become local roads, and some cross the county line and become another county route. Hamilton County's 25-route system is the smallest system of signed county routes in the state of New York. The closest one after is Tioga County, located in the Southern Tier of New York. Route numbers, lengths, and termini are derived from the 2010 NYSDOT Hamilton County inventory unless otherwise noted.

Everyday (Phil Collins song)

"Everyday" is a ballad pop song by Phil Collins released as the second single of his fifth studio album, "Both Sides". It's also been released as the seventh track on the first CD of the 2004 compilation album, "". The single achieved success mostly in North America in the spring of 1994.
History.
Due to the lackluster success of the first single of the album, "Both Sides of the Story", which only peaked at #25 on Billboard Hot 100, Collins' record label urged the release of the second single. The decision was right, the single peaked one place higher than the previous single, peaked at #24 on Billboard Hot 100. However, in the UK (Collins' native country), the single performed worse than the previous single, peaking at #15. This song was only performed live during Collins' 1994 concerts.
Music video.
The song's music video features Collins moving into a new house. Inside his new house, all of his properties are still covered and the wall is painted white. He was singing and playing piano throughout the video. Collins' record label didn't promote the single heavily, so the video did not get much airplay on MTV and VH1, just as same as his previous single, "Both Sides of the Story".

James "Jim" "Frosty" Miller (born 3 May 1944) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for Carlton in the Victorian Football League (VFL) and had a noted career with Dandenong in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). 
Recruited from the small town of Garfield, Miller won the 1963 West Gippsland Football League goalkicking award with 121 goals.
Miller, a full-forward, started his career at Carlton and showed glimpses of his prolific goalkicking in his two seasons, scoring five goals against Hawthorn in just his second game and managing a sequence of five, six and four goals during the 1964 season. Miller decided to leave Carlton midway in 1965 he returned to Garfield. In 1966 he set a West Gippsland league record of 148 goals.
He joined VFA club Dandenong in 1967 and soon became a valuable member of the team playing at full forward. He kicked 106 goals in 1969. He was a member of Dandenong's 1971 premiership team, remembered for a controversial free kick that he received before the opening siren of the Grand Final. The umpire, believing that Preston full-back Barrie Leslie had pushed Miller in the back, awarded a free kick despite the start of play not having been signalled. Miller kicked the goal and four quarters later Dandenong won by six points. Preston lodged a protest after the game and it went to a VFA hearing, with the final decision from the committee going in Dandenong's favour 39 votes to five. Miller was also a member of Dandenong's victorious 1967 Grand Final team.
From 1968 to 1971, Miller topped the league's goalkicking. He was the leading goalkicker again in 1973 with a career high 108 goals and again for the sixth and final time in 1974. By the time he retired in 1976 he had amassed 885 goals at an average of 4.8 per game.
Miller became Captain-Coach of Berwick of the South West Gippsland Football League in 1977. In 1978 he kicked 201 goals for the season, the fourth man to achieve this feat. He stopped playing in 1981 after injuries hampered his last three seasons.
The Jim 'Frosty' Miller Medal, awarded to the leading goalkicking in the modern day VFL, is named in his honour. He is a full-forward in Dandenong's official 'Team of the Century'.

The Avro 508 was a prototype British reconnaissance aircraft of the 1910s.
Development.
The Avro 508 was built at Avro's Manchester works in December 1913 and assembled at Brooklands in January 1914. First exhibited in Manchester in January 1914, the 508 was a wooden fabric-covered pusher biplane of unusual shape, resembling a back-to-front Avro 504. Its top and bottom three bay wings were equal in length, made of fabric-covered wood.
Operational history.
It was completed by March 1914, and shown at the Olympia Aero Show in London, however its first flight was at the start of official testing in April 1915 at Brooklands. The Royal Flying Corps showed no interest in the sole prototype and therefore the aircraft lived out the rest of its days as a training aircraft and engine tester at RAF Hendon, until it was dismantled in April 1916.

L'Essor

"L'Essor" (fr. "Progress") is the state-owned national daily newspaper published in Bamako, Mali. Its motto is ""La Voix du Peuple"" ("The Voice of the People).
History.
"L'Essor" was first published in 1949, and from 1953 was the official publication of the Union Soudanaise-Rassemblement Démocratique Africain, the leading anti-colonial political party of what was then French Soudan. Prior to independence, Bamako was home to a large number of such publications, produced by most political factions. Through the 1960s, most were outlawed, disbanded, or simply failed financially. Following the 1968 military coup, "L'Essor" became the organ of the CMLN, Mali's ruling junta. In 1979, as part of the move to civilian governance, the paper was transferred to the unitary political party of the former military rulers, the UDPM. During this period, largely due to better distribution and higher literacy, circulation grew from 12,000 daily (early 1970s) to over 40,000 (late 1980s). Even after the fall of the Socialist government in 1968, the paper continued to carry articles from the Soviet and Chinese wire services, giving it an anti-Western slant. Most domestic writing prior to 1991 focused on local events and government decrees and speeches. Following the 1991 return to democracy, "L'Essor" was again transferred, this time to a new government owned printing and distribution house, the Malian Agency for Press and Publicity. While managed by the Malian Ministry of Communications & Information Technology, the AMP and "L'Essor" retain a high degree of independence from the government.
Operations.
"L'Essor" is one of 15 French language dailies published Mali. Most are printed in Bamako, and "L'Essor" alone retains a national reach. Its circulation is challenged only by the two largest French language private dailies, Les Echos and Nouvel Horizon. The AMAP has its own printing facilities, which also print government publications, including the "Journal Officiel" which publishes all official government pronouncement, debates, laws and regulations. "L'Essor" maintains a weekly, "L'Essor Hébdo", which focuses on social issues. Editorials in "L'Essor" come from the editorial staff and management, not the government, and press organisations have judged the paper to be largely free of government interference, a charge leveled at the state broadcaster ORTM. Journalists for "L’Essor" itself have claimed there is self-censorship in dealing with those in power: "Since "L’Essor" is governmentally owned, there are limits to what we can write about politics. But when it comes to social issues, we have a great freedom, there are no taboos."
"L'Essor" also has economic advantages, in that government ministries and state enterprises use its pages for their advertisements, for legal notices, and purchase newspaper subscriptions. On the other hand, it maintains reporters and distribution across the nation, tasks too expensive for private papers. All state printing and broadcast agencies receive government subsidies, and while private publishers an eligible for smaller subsidies, they must be assessed to have met certain financial, labour, bookkeeping, and distribution standards. 
As of 2008, "L'Essor"s Director is Souleymane Drabo and Editor is Ousma Maïga.

Hua Hill

Hua Hill (Shandong) () is a solitary cone-shaped hill in the lower Yellow River valley, located at the northeastern edge of the city of Jinan, Shandong Province, China. The hill is 
known for its cultural and historical significance as well as for its natural beauty. It has been an inspiration for Chinese artists for 
many centuries and was the site of the Battle of An, a major battle fought during the Spring and Autumn Period.
Name.
The name Huà Shān is sometimes spoken as Huá Shān and can be translated literally as "Flowery Hill" or "Splendid Hill". The first character of the name (华) has long been used as a literary rather than political synonym for China itself. The second character of the name (山) is used for mountains and hills, irrespective of their size. The name Huà Shān (华山) as well as the near homophone Huā Shān (花山, literally "Flower Mountain") are both common names in Chinese geography. In particular, Hua Hill is not to be confused with Mount Hua in Shaanxi Province. Hua Hill is also known as Hua Fu Zhu Hill ().
Hill.
Hua Hill is one of the "Nine Solitary Hills" () in the Yellow River 
valley within and to the north of Jinan City; the other eight hills 
are (names used during the Qing Dynasty): Woniu Hill 
(), Que Hill (, literally "Magpie Hill", located about 2.5 kilometers north of the Hua 
Hill on the other side of the Yellow River), Biao Hill 
(, meaning "Landmark Hill"), Fenghuang Hill 
(, Fenghuang is the "Chinese Phoenix"), Northern Maan Hill (, meaning "Northern Horseshoe Hill"), Su Hill 
(, literally "Grain Hill"), Kuang Hill (, literally "Basket Hill"), and Yao Hill (, 
literally "Medicine Hill"). 
The hill has an elevation of 197 meters above sea level; its 
slopes are covered with large smooth rocks and bushy vegetation 
growing in the clefts between them. The foot of the hill is flanked by 
small villages on the eastern and western side. To the east and south, 
the hill is also surrounded by a crescent-shaped row of ponds. A 
flight of stone stairs has been laid up the southern flank of the hill 
to the summit. 
In the times before the Northern Song Dynasty, Hua Hill was 
surrounded by a lake known as the "Magpie Hill Lake" (), named for the nearby Magpie Hill. Since Hua Hill appeared to float on the waters of the lake like the bud of a lotus flower 
to contemporary observers, it was given its alternative name "Hua Fu 
Zhu Shan" ("Flower Bud in the Water Hill").
Historical significance.
In the year 589 BC, during the Spring and Autumn Period, Hua Hill 
became the site of the final action in the Battle of An which was 
fought between the states of Qi and Jin. During the preparation for the battle, the Qi army used 
the Northern Maan Hill (about 4 kilometers southwest of Hua Hill) 
as a staging area. The Jin army had its positions right at Hua 
Hill. The Qi army started the battle by attacking the Jin positions on 
Hua Hill, but the battle ended in a victory for the State of 
Jin. Eventually an alliance was formed between the two states. 
During part of the 20th century, a small fortified army base was 
located at the hill. Although the base has been abandoned, some 
fortifications in the form of bunkers and tunnels at the foot of the 
hill remain.
Cultural significance.
The natural beauty of Hua Hill has inspired the works of both writers 
and painters. 
During the period of the Northern Wei Dynasty, the writer and 
geographer Li Daoyuan, described Hua Hill in his ""Commentary on the Waterways Classic"" (): "Without a mountain range 
to support it, the peak alone stands gracefully and loftily. Its 
verdant cliff rises into the blue, tinting the moon with its green." 
The Tang-Dynasty poet Li Bai wrote about Hua 
Hill:
The best known pictorial depiction of Hua Hill is a painting from 
the Yuan-Dynasty era entitled ""Autumn Colors at Que and Hua Hills"" () by the painter and calligrapher 
Zhao Mengfu (now in the collection of the National Palace Museum in Taipeh). 
In the text accompanying his painting, Zhao Mengfu revers to Hua Hill as "the most famous
mountain in the area, having been known from antiquity and unique for its sharp peak".
Various rock faces on the mountain slope have been adorned with 
calligraphic inscriptions.
Temples.
The Huayang Palace (, literally "Glorious 
Sun Palace") is a primarily Taoist temple located at the southern 
foot of the hill on gently sloping terrain. Its founding during the 
Jin Dynasty (in the year 1220) is attributed to Chen Zhiyuan, a 
disciple of the Quanzhen Taoist Qiu Chuji, who in turn was the 
foremost disciple of Wang Chongyang, the founder of Quanzhen 
Taoism. The original purpose of the building was to serve as a 
Taoist temple dedicated to the "Five Color Gods" () representing east (, green), west 
(, white), north (, black), 
south (, red), and center (, yellow). Over time, the temple has also come to include sites of 
worship for Buddhism and Confucianism. 
In 1532, during the Ming Dynasty, the palace complex was renamed 
into Chong Zheng Temple (, literally 
"Admiration of the Righteousness Temple"). The central hall of the 
complex was dedicated to two persons worshipped at the time, Feng Chou 
Fu and Min Ziqian (Style name of Min Sun, one of the disciples of Confucius). 
The two side halls were dedicated to groups of 19 
and 22 people famous in the period, respectively. 
Later in the Ming Dynasty, the name of the complex was changed back to 
Huayang Palace and dedicated to the God of the Four Seasons 
During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, 
temples dedicated to the god Bi Xia (, the god of 
Mount Tai) and the three gods of heaven, earth, and water 
() were added. Part of the Huayang Palace is 
the Taishan Resting Palace (), it was 
used by the emperor as a resting place on his way to Mount Tai. 
The grounds of Huayang Palace cover a rectangular area of 
approximately 3 hectares, which is completely enclosed by a 
stone-and-brick wall. Between the temple buildings stand old pine 
trees (some around 900 years old) as well as stone stelas. 
In the 20th century, the Huayang Palace was used as a military storage 
facility for about 50 years. It was reopened to the public in 
1990. The books kept in the palace were destroyed during the 
Cultural Revolution. Some wall paintings in the temple buildings 
were also plastered over and covered with slogans of the Cultural 
Revolution during this time. 
The present-day entrance to the complex is the gate to the inner 
courtyard of the palace; the outer courtyard has not been 
preserved. The gate currently standing dates back to the Ming and Qing 
Dynasties; there is no record about the previous gates which are 
likely to have previously occupied its place. The gate building houses 
the statues of the "Four Zhi Gong Cao" (), four minor deities (Year Zhi, Month Zhi, Day Zhi, and Hour 
Zhi) that are thought to be positioned on the border between heaven 
and earth in order to fulfill book- and gate keeping duties. 
Further up on the slope of the mountain lies the smaller 
Daoist Lü Dongbin Temple (), 
dedicated to Lü Dongbin, one of the Eight Immortals.
Hua Spring.
A spring, the Hua Spring (), is located at the 
southern foot of the hill in front of the entrance to the Huayang 
Palace. The Hua Spring mentioned in the traditions about the 
events at the Battle of An: The King of Qi is said to have used the 
pretense of fetching water from the Hua Spring as an excuse for 
fleeing the battle field in the face of imminent defeat. Over time, 
the spring has fallen dry various times. Its most recent revival was 
undertaken during a renovation in the year 2000. During this work, a 
pool with an area of 17.6 meters times 10 meters and depth 
of 3.5 meters was excavated, bringing the outflow from the spring 
up to a maximum of 40 cubic meters per hour (during the rainy season).
Protection and development.
Huayang Palace became a Jinan City Heritage site on September 3, 1979. The Huashan landscape area intended to protect its surroundings was opened on October 1, 2000.

Smokey Mayfield

Arlie Vincent Mayfield, I (June 20, 1924 – September 11, 2008), known as Smokey Mayfield, was a ranch supervisor in the Texas Panhandle and a bluegrass musician. In the late 1940s, Mayfield and his brothers played warmup for Tennessee Ernie Ford, Maddox Brothers and Rose, Hank Snow, and other country singers. 
Mayfield was born to William Fletcher Mayfield (died 1952) and the former Penelope Drake (died 1937) in rural Dawn in Deaf Smith County southwest of Amarillo. In January 1931, he moved with his parents, three brothers, and two sisters to Dimmitt, the county seat of Castro County near Lubbock in West Texas, where he attended school, having left high school before graduation. He served in the United States Army in the European Theater of World War II and participated, at the age of 20, in the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium in December 1944 – January 1945. 
A family of musicians.
The Mayfields possessed a strong musical background. All played musical instruments, beginning with the mandolin. Mayfield and two brothers, Thomas Edward "Edd" Mayfield (1926–1958) and Herbert E. Mayfield (1920–2008), went on the Bluegrass circuit and opened in Amarillo and Lubbock for Tennessee Ernie Ford and the Maddox Brothers and Rose as the Green Valley Boys, named for their ranch. Edd Mayfield left the family band and played the guitar with a thumbpick for a decade with Bill Monroe, considered the "father of Bluegrass". Edd Mayfield was described as "a handsome, tough-as-barbed-wire cowpuncher, who literally grew up on a ranch, who could ride hard, lasso accurately, and literally toss and tie up a bull … and had the wiry strength of a gymnast." While he was on tour with Monroe, Edd Mayfield died of leukemia in a hospital in Bluefield, West Virginia.
Herb Mayfield recalled that he and his brothers enjoyed music so much that they would race home after doing their ranch chores so that they could practice. Eventually, Smokey chose the fiddle as his instrument. He was, however, too small to hold a full-sized instrument under his chin. So he anchored the fiddle between his chest and the wall of the barn. He continued to play in that position, with the fiddle on his chest rather than under his chin, into adulthood.
Smokey Mayfield resided in Hutchinson County near Spearman, which is the seat of Hansford County in the northern Panhandle. He and worked for a half century for the historic Turkey Track Ranch in Hutchinson County. Herb Mayfield was born in Erick, Oklahoma, but lived in Dimmitt and graduated from Dimmitt High School. During World War II, he participated in troop lifts in Normandy and, like Smokey, the Battle of the Bulge. Thereafter, he was a welder for cattle feedlots in Dimmitt. He was for many years the president of the Dimmitt Rodeo Association and a member of the Panhandle Blue Grass Association. He died some three months prior to the passing of Smokey.
Extended family.
In 1951, Smokey Mayfield married the former Mary Keenum (born August 5, 1934), originally from Hale Center in Hale County. The couple met while Smokey was playing Bluegrass in Lubbock. They wed in Cleburne in Johnson County in east central Texas. Mary formerly operated a flower shop. Mayfield died of a heart attack at home after fighting a long battle against neuropathy. He was Baptist, but services were held at his wife's congregation, the Church of Christ in Spearman. Interment, with military honors, was at Hansford Cemetery in Spearman.
In addition to Mary, he was survived by two sons, James Clinton "Clint" Mayfield (born February 28, 1952), a United States Postal Service employee in Amarillo, and wife Eileen N. Mayfield (also born 1952), and Freddie Calvin Mayfield (born December 28, 1949) and wife Janice W. Mayfield (born 1955) of Spearman; three daughters, Cynthia Arlece Knox and husband Ted of Stinnett, the seat of Hutchinson County, Loretta Diane Reed and husband Roy of Chickaloon, Alaska, and Harriett Palmer and husband Charlie of Pleasanton in Atascosa County near San Antonio, and nine grandchildren, including namesake Arlie Vincent Mayfield, II (born 1988), a student at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.; 14 great-grandchildren; and one brother, James F. "Jim" Mayfield (born 1917), a retired rancher from Playas in Hidalgo County in southwestern New Mexico. Fred Mayfield, a ranch manager himself, was actually the birth son of Edd Mayfield and his wife, the former Jo McLain, since Jo Butler of Atwater, California, but Fred was reared by Smokey and Mary Mayfield after the sudden death of his father.
Mayfield's legacy.
On May 6, 1989, Smokey and Herb Mayfield were honored by South Plains College, a community college in Levelland, the seat of Hockley County west of Lubbock, as "Pioneers of Bluegrass Music in the South Plains." They received plaques and belt buckles as "Honorary Bill Monroe Bluegrass Boys". The two played for decades in regional music festivals. Edd’s son, Fred Mayfield, joined his uncles for the occasion. The Mayfields are also honored through the Mayfield Bluegrass Scholarship at South Plains College, 1401 S. College Avenue, Levelland, TX 79336.
Mary Mayfield said that her husband "had perfect pitch, never had a music lesson, and couldn't read music, but he could play anything he heard." His last Bluegrass jamboree was in Amarillo in 1992. He also played in Cloudcroft, New Mexico, and Nashville, Tennessee in a reunion concert with Bill Monroe. 
The radio performances and personal appearances of the Mayfield Brothers in West Texas inspired Waylon Jennings, Sonny Curtis, and Buddy Holly of a later generation of musicians. The International Bluegrass Music Museum in Owensboro, Kentucky, is preparing a documentary on the Mayfield family.

1980 Chatham Cup

The 1980 Chatham Cup was the 53rd annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand.
Early stages of the competition were run in three regions (northern, central, and southern), with the National League teams receiving a bye until the Fourth Round of the competition. In all, 93 teams took part in the competition. Note: Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article.
The 1980 final.
The match returned to its former regular home, the Basin Reserve, for the first time since 1972. Mount Wellington won the competition, becoming the third team to win the league/cup double. Dunedin City became the first side from that southern city to reach the final since Saint Kilda in 1965.
Te match was a dour affair, with the Mount scoring both of the goals. The first was scored after eleven minutes when a Clive Campbell corner was headed into the Dunedin goal by Stewart Carruthers — a welcome change from his sending off in the previous year's final. The second goal, from Billy McClure, was the highlight of the match.

Workers forage to feed their siblings. Their diet consists of a wide range of insects, including crop pests, and for this reason the hornets are regarded as beneficial. The workers dismember the bodies of their prey to return only the most nutrient-rich body parts, such as flight muscles, to the nest. There, the workers chew the prey into a paste before feeding the larvae who in return produce a fluid consumed by the workers. This fluid is known as vespa amino acid mixture (VAAM). The fluid enables intensive muscle activities over extended periods, allowing them to fly per day and reach up to . Synthetic VAAM is being produced artificially as a dietary supplement to increase athletic performance. In many Japanese mountain villages, the hornet is considered a delicacy when fried.
Bee predation.
In Japan, beekeepers often prefer European honey bees because they are more productive than the endemic Japanese honey bees. However, it is quite difficult to maintain a captive hive of European honey bees, as the hornets will often prey on the bees.
Once a Japanese giant hornet has located a hive of European honey bees it leaves pheromone markers around it that quickly attract nest-mates to converge on the hive. A single hornet can kill forty European honey bees in a minute; a group of 30 hornets can destroy an entire hive containing 30,000 bees in a little more than three hours. The hornets kill and dismember the bees, returning to their nest with the bee thoraxes, which they feed to their larvae, leaving heads and limbs behind; the bee larvae are also taken to feed the hornet larvae. The hornets also eat the bees' honey.
The Japanese honey bee, however, has a defense against these attacks. When a hornet approaches the hive to release pheromones, the bee workers will retreat back to the hive, leaving an opening to allow the hornet scout to enter. At a given point, the bees emerge from their hiding places in an angry cloud formation containing some 500 individuals. They form a tight ball around the hornet that acts like a convection oven when the bees vibrate their wings to direct air over their bodies, warmed by their muscular exertion, into the inside of the ball. The interior temperature of the ball rises to . The hornet can survive maximum temperatures of , but the bees can survive up to , so the hornet is killed and the bees survive.
Venom.
The Japanese giant hornet is large and fearsome, but it is not particularly aggressive unless it feels threatened. It has a venom which is injected by the 6.25 mm-long (quarter-inch) stinger and attacks the nervous system and damages tissues of its victims.
Tests with mice find the venom not to be among the most lethal, having an of 4.1 mg/kg, which compares to the deadliest wasp venom (to mice) by weight of "Vespa luctuosa" at 1.6 mg/kg. The potency of the sting is due to the relatively large amount of venom injected. Being stung is extremely painful and can require hospital treatment. Asian giant hornet stings in general can cause anaphylactic shock in allergic people, and can be lethal even to people who are not allergic if the dose is sufficient. Advice in China is that people stung more than 10 times need medical help, and emergency treatment for more than 30 stings. The stings can cause renal failure. Thirty to forty people die in Japan every year after having been stung, which makes the Japanese giant hornet the most lethal animal in Japan (bears kill zero to five people and venomous snakes kill five to ten people each year).

<doc id="19309189" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19309189" title="Kansas Pacific R. Co. v. Dunmeyer">
Kansas Pacific R. Co. v. Dunmeyer

Kansas Pacific R. Co. v. Dunmeyer, , was a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Kansas. The action was brought in that court on a covenant of warranty of title to two pieces of land in a deed of conveyance made by the Kansas Pacific Railroad Company to Dunmeyer. 
The suit was brought for breach of covenant of warranty of title to a tract of land in Kansas. Plaintiff in error was defendant below. Its title was derived from grants of public land to aid in the construction of a railway to the Pacific. The tract was within the location of the railroad grants, but was excepted from those grants by reason of a homestead entry and possession. Subsequent to this entry and possession, the party so in possession took title from the railroad company, and the homestead entry was cancelled. The alleged paramount adverse title was derived from a patent from the United States issued on a homestead entry made subsequent to these proceedings. The Supreme Court of Kansas found that there was a breach of the warranty, and rendered judgment accordingly. This writ of error was brought to review that judgment.
The land was sold by the company to George W. Miller, to whom a certificate of sale was given, which afterwards was assigned to Lewis Dunmeyer, to whom the company made a deed purporting to convey a good title. On this covenant for good title Dunmeyer brought the present action, alleging that the railroad company never had any title, and that the covenant was therefore broken. On this issue the case was tried. Several other defenses were set up, among them that the covenant was not broken, because Dunmeyer was in possession when he bought the certificate issued to Miller and when he took his deed, and has never been disturbed or ousted; that Miller was in possession when he bought of the company and transferred possession to Dunmeyer, and that this has been held ever since, and that Miller's purchase was a compromise of disputed rights, and he and Dunmeyer are therefore estopped to maintain this action. But these and perhaps other points, decided against plaintiff in error, do not present questions of federal law which this Court can review in a judgment of a state court.
The record shows that on July 25, 1866, Miller made a homestead entry on this land which was in every respect valid if the land was then public land subject to such entry. It also shows that the line of definite location of the company's road was first filed with the Commissioner of the General Land Office at Washington, September 21, 1866. This entry of Miller's therefore brought the land within the language of the exception in the grant as land to which a homestead claim had attached at the time the line of said road was definitely fixed. For we are of opinion that under this grant, as under many other grants containing the same words or words to the same purport, the act which fixes the time of definite location is the act of filing the map or plat of this line in the office of the commissioner of the General Land Office.
Of two arguments made, the stronger is in regards that while the company did not file its line of definite location until about two months after Miller made his homestead entry, it did designate the general route of said road, and file a map thereof in the General Land Office July 11 of the same year, 1866, which was fifteen days before Miller's homestead entry. This latter map was filed in the office of the register and receiver on 26 July, one day after Miller made his entry.
It is argued that until this was done, Miller's right of entry remained unaffected. But the court was of opinion that the duty of filing this map, as required by the act, like that of the line of definite location, is performed by filing it in the General Land Office, which is filing it with the Secretary of the Interior, and that whatever rights accrue to the company from the act of filing it accrue from filing it there.
In this case before the high court, a claim was made and filed in the land office, and there recognized, before the line of the company's road was located. That claim was an existing one of public record in favor of Miller when the map of plaintiff in error was filed. In the language of the act of Congress, this homestead claim had attached to the land, and it therefore did not pass by the grant.
Of all the words in the English language, this word "attached' was probably the best that could have been used. It did not mean mere settlement, residence, or cultivation of the land, but it meant a proceeding in the proper land office, by which the inchoate right to the land was initiated. It meant that by such a proceeding, a right of homestead had fastened to that land which could ripen into a perfect title by future residence and cultivation. With the performance of these conditions the company had nothing to do. The right of the homestead having attached to the land, it was excepted out of the grant as much as if, in a deed, it had been excluded from the conveyance by metes and bounds.
The difference in the two cases is obvious. The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Kansas was affirmed.

T7 DNA polymerase

The T7 DNA polymerase of the T7 bacteriophage is a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase responsible for the fast rate of T7 phage DNA replication "in vivo". The polymerase consists of a 1:1 complex of the viral T7 gene 5 protein (80kDA) and the E. coli thioredoxin (12kDA).
It lacks a 5'→ 3' exonuclease domain, but the 3'→5' exonuclease activities are approximately 1000-fold greater than that of Klenow fragment. The exonuclease activity appears to be responsible for the high fidelity of this enzyme and prevents strand displacement synthesis
This polymerase is unique due to its considerable processivity, or ability to stay on DNA for a greater than average number of base pairs. It is also suitable for site-directed mutagenesis but is not recommended for DNA sequencing applications.

Crimson Skies (video game)

Crimson Skies is an arcade flight computer game developed by Zipper Interactive and published in 2000 by Microsoft Game Studios. Although a flight-based game, "Crimson Skies" is not a genuine flight simulator, as the game is based less on flight mechanics than on action. According to series creator Jordan Weisman, "Crimson Skies" is "not about simulating reality—it's about fulfilling fantasies."
The game is set in an alternate history of the 1930s in which the United States has balkanized into a number of smaller sovereignties, and in which air travel has become the primary mode of transportation in North America. The game centers on Nathan Zachary, an adventurous air pirate seeking to rob the affluent of their wealth and power. Throughout the campaign, Zachary leads his gang of air pirates, the Fortune Hunters, on a quest to gain fame and riches.
"Crimson Skies" is often regarded as a "cult success," commercially successful only to a limited extent. The game has received generally favorable reviews; it has been noted for its high-quality voice acting, gameplay, and atmosphere. Notable technical issues, however, have been known to plague the game, the most notorious of which was the tendency to delete saved game files until a patch was released.
Gameplay.
"Crimson Skies" is a cross between an authentic flight simulator and an arcade flight game. Although flight mechanics such as lift are still present, the game's planes are generally overpowered, allowing them to perform aerobatic maneuvers impossible in reality under similar circumstances. According to lead game designer John Howard: We're not trying to build a realistic flight simulation, but at the same time, "Crimson Skies" isn't a cartoony, arcade-type game, either. We had to find a middle ground, where the planes were more powerful, more responsive and more intuitive to fly, so that the player can just concentrate on being a hero.
GameSpot has stated that "the flight model in "Crimson Skies" is light on the physics and heavy on the barnstorming." In this way, the site likened the game's arcade flight model to the "stunt-flying heroics of pulp novel fame," in which "daredevil pilots performed unbelievable (and quite impossible) feats of showmanship and gunnery." To this effect, the game features select "danger zones"—difficult spaces situated throughout the environment through which the player can fly to dissuade pursuing aircraft. Such stunts are also documented in the player's "scrapbook," which is the game's record of the player's accomplishments throughout the campaign.
The gameplay of "Crimson Skies" takes place through the player controlling an aircraft through the game's various environments. The game offers three cameras during missions: first-person perspectives with or without a cockpit visible, and a third-person view. The game's heads-up display features basic flight instrumentation such as the compass, altimeter, and speedometer, as well as a damage indicator for the player's aircraft and ammunition displays for the plane's primary and secondary weapons. The game also provides the player with a feature known as the "spyglass," which provides a magnified image of the selected target and indicates its current heading.
The game features eleven different playable aircraft, each of which can be customized. For any aircraft, the player can select its airframe, engine, armor, weapons layout, and paint scheme, although customization is limited by the weight capacity of the airframe and—in the single player campaign—the player's cash on hand. Outfitting an aircraft with different components affects its performance in terms of speed, maneuverability, stamina, and offense. The player is also able to equip his/her aircraft's guns and hardpoints with different types of ammunition and rockets, respectively.
The game's single player campaign has three difficulty levels, and spans twenty-four missions. Before the start of a mission, the plane and ammunition for both the player and his/her wingman can be selected, although wingmate commands are not available during gameplay.
In addition to the campaign, an instant action mode is available which allows the player to play individual missions or customized scenarios. Multiplayer is also available through the Reverb Gaming lobby, over a LAN or the Internet, or via a direct serial connection. Players can host games or join existing ones; the host selects the game's victory conditions and allowable aircraft components/ammunition. Multiplayer game modes include dogfight, capture the flag, and Zeppelin-to-Zeppelin combat.
Plot.
Setting.
The "Crimson Skies" universe is set in an alternate history of the year 1937. According to the game's backstory, factors such as the growing strength of the "Regionalist Party," the division between "wet" and "dry" states, and a quarantine caused by an Influenza outbreak resulted in a general shift in power from federal to state and local levels. After the Wall Street Crash of '29, states began seceding from the U.S. A number of independent nation-states form from the fractured United States; hostilities between these sovereignties eventually escalate into outright war.
After the breakup of America, the former nation's railroad and highway systems fell into disuse as they crossed hostile borders. Consequently, the airplane and the airship became the primary modes of transportation in North America, which in turn gave birth to air piracy. Although air militias formed to defend against the air pirates, continuous brushfire wars between the nations prevent the established governments from effectively repelling the pirate threat.
Characters.
The player character is Nathan Zachary, a man well known in the game world as a reputable ladies' man and a notorious air pirate. He is the leader of a group of sky pirates, the Fortune Hunters. Zachary dislikes the wealthy and privileged, seeing them as selfish and insensitive towards the less privileged; as a result, Zachary and his gang have a penchant for stripping the rich of their money and influence. Zachary's "articles of piracy" insist that his gang are not to harm the innocent, and that they steal only from those who can afford the loss. IGN has stated that the Fortune Hunters are "wonderfully ambiguous […] in the moral sense," qualifying that "It's always great to see heroes […] who aren't too good to be true."
The Fortune Hunters are based on the Zeppelin "Pandora", and comprise the airship's crew as well as six pilots—Nathan Zachary and his wingman Jack Mulligan, "Tex" Ryder and her wingman "Buck" Deere, "Big John" Washington and Betty "Brooklyn" Charles. Later joining Nathan and his gang are Dr. Wilhelm Fassenbiender, a scientist and friend of Nathan's since World War I, as well as his daughter, Dr. Ilse Fassenbiender.
Opposing the Fortune Hunters are rival pirates and privateers, such as The Black Swan, Jonathan "Genghis" Kahn, and Ulysses Boothe. Also fighting Zachary and his gang are private security firms such as Blake Aviation Security and militia squadrons such as the Hollywood Knights. Many of these opponents are old rivals or former love interests of Nathan Zachary.
Storyline.
Nathan Zachary is a great war hero pilot. Before he meets up with his crew and forms the Fortune Hunters, he saves damsels in distress and fights enemies. Until when he arrives in New York he and his three other wingmen present (Jack, Tex and Buck) hijack the Empire State Zeppelin the FULCRUM and reconstructed it, to the current PANDORA. Three of the FULCRUM's crew also joins the Fortune Hunters (Big John, Betty and Sparks).
Soon later down south in Cuba, Nathan and the Fortune Hunters fight against the British and the Medusas in Cuba. He also finds that his former partner, Lucas Miles betraying him. Just as well he orders his crew to open fire on Miles' Zeppelin where it burns and crashes, while the Fortune Hunters flee to safety.
Soon later, the Fortune Hunters and Medusas are socialising, while Nathan is stuck in the PANDORA. He refuses to come down, until he mentions of a gold steal which he tells Jack. They then head to a group of Hawaiian islands, where they successfully find the treasure, although after finding it they are soon tracked by the Medusas who want the treasure for themselves and the British who want the Hawaiian islands under English rule. The Fortune Hunters repel an initial Medusa attack before fighting the British for the first time and stealing one of their bombers to locate their base of operations. Finding it at another island where a slave camp and zeppelin dock is being built, they liberate the work camp and steal a zeppelin salvaging mechanism from the zeppelin dock, alongside dealing with another unsuccessful British retaliation. Finally, the Fortune Hunters claim their treasure back in the main island with their new equipment and repel the Medusas one last time along with their leader Justine Perot.
On the trip heading away from Hawaii, Nathan receives a call from Dr. Wilhelm Fassenbiender, an old friend he met during the Great War. However it turns to be his daughter Ilsa and she explains of the predicament where her father was captured by the Russian Chekka secret police for their reasons, which leads the Fortune Hunters to Pacifica. The Dr. appears to be on a cruise Zeppelin called the WORKER'S VOYAGE belonging to the CCCP, which the Fortune Hunters attack. Nathan then fights the Russians and also an old friend the Black Swan. After downing Swan and her crew, he daringly saves the Dr. while up in the air out high. Later back down on land, while fighting the local security firm Blake Aviation Security, Nathan saves Ilsa and steals the Blue Streak Bloodhawk, a prototype plane the Dr. works on with his daughter. Soon after one night Nathan suggests a steal of fuel supplies from an arriving Russian tanker, which pits the Fortune Hunters once more against the Russians. They are successful and even survive attacks from a Russian support zeppelin escorting the tanker. Paladin Blake, CEO of Blake Aviation Security then warns the Fortune Hunters to leave Pacifica given Blake has a zeppelin containing an armada of fighters. The Fortune Hunters however sabotage the zeppelin and destroy it, along with Nathan personally fighting Blake himself. Blake loses, and the Fortune Hunters leave Pacifica. Just before they do, they save a hospital ship that was attempting to rescue the crashed WORKER'S VOYAGE in the area from a rival pirate gang the Black Hats and their apparent leader Ace Dixon.
At the Nation of Hollywood, Nathan remembers his rival Johnny Johnson now handling security affairs while Howard Hughes, president of Hughes Aviation Security (the aviation security company there) is away. Nathan decides to knock Johnny given his pompous personality and is able to sneak in Betty into a movie studio where she has a role. The Fortune Hunters then rescue Lana Cooper who is not happy with her contract and wish to escape. After she is rescued, Johnny, now embarrassed that he fails to keep Hollywood safe, tries to show off publicity by showing the biggest plane ever, named the Spruce Goose. Nathan gets on stealing the giant plane with the help of Betty, and also has a showdown with Hollywood ace Charlie Steele and the Hollywood Knights. With all his convictions, he is invited to an aerial stunt race with aces, pirates, aviators, aviatrixes and even Johnny Johnson himself in the competition, to prove the best pilot. Nathan, after the competition realises it is a trap to lure him away from the PANDORA so it can be destroyed by Hughes Aviation and he goes on a one-to-one anti-Zeppelin battle with his crew against Hughes Aviation and their Zeppelin. Though after battle, the PANDORA was victorious but was in terrible shape, which fortunately the Fortune Hunters have found a cargo zeppelin flying through the Nation of Hollywood which can help them get into Sky Haven by towing the damaged PANDORA. The cargo zeppelin is defended by Blake Aviation Security, and thus Nathan and the crew fight them one more time, emerging victorious.
While in Sky Haven, Nathan and the Black Swan had lost their crews and now try to get them back. It turns out that the Black Hats have captured their crews for some reason. Nathan first battles the Black Hats and commander Ace Dixon then saves Sparks from an exploding train who beforehand contacted Nathan for help. Sparks explains the crew was kidnapped by the Black Hats themselves, and Nathan goes on a military autogyro fight with Ulysses Boothe, who turns out to be the leader of the Black Hats. Nathan goes in a military autogyro fight against Boothe and succeeds even when outnumbered. Nathan and Swan decide to capture Boothe so as to use him as bait to know of the crews' location in exchange for Boothe. Nathan and Black Swan drop Boothe off and learn the location of the crews which the Black Hats kept in a self-destructing cargo zeppelin. Nathan manages to save the crews and the PANDORA from destruction by the Black Hats who try to double cross them, however Swan is downed and captured in the process. Eventually the Fortune Hunters go to destroy the Black Hat mansion as payback, rescue the Black Swan who was held prisoner and steals aerial torpedoes. Nathan soon notices the Black Hats are hard at work to destroy Blake Aviation Security, which he finds odd. The Fortune Hunters intercept a Black Hat attack on Blake and his cargo zeppelins by attacking the Black Hats. Earning trust and their enmity gone, Blake and Nathan work together in destroying the Black Hat zeppelin aiming to deal with them both.
Nathan later realises that the new security firm Sacred Trust Incorporated is corrupt, led by his former partner Lucas Miles who survived the last battle. They are planning to conquer the entire divided America, especially with their influence over the Empire State and its capitol Manhattan, in favour of Germany. Working together with the Black Hats they attempt to destroy Blake Aviation to ensure no resistance will be present. Nathan and Blake head to New York, where they try to deal with Sacred Trust personally. After a tip-off from a taxi gyro Nathan sabotages the Black Hats in one of their illegal operations where he destroys a German freighter and warehouse containing Miles' loot which was to be shipped to Berlin. Later, the Fortune Hunters learn that a Sacred Trust accountant named Waldo Carney has information about the company's evil schemes and tried to flee but is under attack by the Black Hats while flying on board a zeppelin liner. Nathan saves Carney, delivering him to the police for safety. Acting on Carney's information, the Fortune Hunters sabotage attempts by Sacred Trust in getting their loot away back to Germany via three cargo zeppelins. They stop Sacred Trust, Nathan even destroying the Spruce Goose as well which was thought to be lost beforehand. Finally exposed, Sacred Trust tries to destroy Manhattan with a zeppelin randomly firing into the city. The Fortune Hunters fight them one last time and possibly with help of Black Swan save Manhattan. Nathan then fights Lucas in a final duel, and emerges victorious with Lucas supposedly dead. After the battle Nathan is offered membership to Blake Aviation but turns it down, Paladin Blake though became ultimately upset with his choice to stay a pirate, but does not try to hunt him down.
In the end, Nathan appears to return with the Black Swan on stealing South American treasure...
Development.
Jordan Weisman, series creator and creative director of "Crimson Skies", has said of the game: "Our whole goal is to give the player the kind of role of being Errol Flynn in a 1930's, 1940's great pirate adventure film of the air." According to Weisman, the inspiration for the game came after he had done research on the early years of aviation; he wished to create a game about the era. Weisman and Dave McCoy came up with the concept of "combining the classic fantasies of pilots and pirates." They then created the series' backstory by proposing changes to the history of the United States that would allow the rise of air piracy.
Development on the game originally began for Virtual World Entertainment, and was changed to a PC game under the name ""Corsairs!"". This original project was shelved, however, prompting Weisman and others to create the board game "Crimson Skies". When FASA later became a part of Microsoft, Weisman was given the opportunity to work on a new project; his choice was to restart production of the "Crimson Skies" PC game.
The original version of the game shipped with numerous technical problems, one of the most notorious was the tendency to delete the player's saved game files. Shortly after the game's release, Microsoft released Crimson Skies Update Version 1.01, a patch specifically designed to fix this problem. Microsoft later released Update Version 1.02 to address other issues, including multiplayer game stability and mission load times.
Recent ATI and Nvidia drivers do not support this game. As such it was only possible to play it in Software Rendering mode. Several fans tried to identify and find the causes of this problem, later gathering at the Nvidia forums, and asking the Nvidia for a fix. Nvidia did not show availability for this. The fanbase tried several paths to a solution, culminating in asking known game graphic modder Timeslip if he could devise a fix.
The unofficial patch is available at Timeslip's homepage, fixes the issue with current graphic drivers and improves the game in some aspects, such as allowing higher resolutions.
Reception and criticism.
"Crimson Skies" is regarded as a "cult favorite" or a "cult success," generally popular only within a limited "cult following." The game, however, has received generally favorable critical reviews. GameSpot said that ""Crimson Skies" does an excellent job of taking the elements of flight simulations that have broad appeal—the shooting and the fancy flying—and embellishing them with a great environment and a good story." IGN called the game "highly inventive, tons of fun and ridiculously addictive," and ranked the game as #65 and #75 respectively on its 2003 and 2005 lists of the "Top 100 Games of All Time."
IGN lauded the game's arcade-style physics model, stating that it made gameplay "exciting and immediate." GameSpot likewise complimented the arcade flight model, stating that it fit with the game's pulp fiction setting and allowed for elaborate stunt flying and fast-paced dogfighting. Other positively received aspects of gameplay include the game's "scrapbook" and aircraft customization features.
The game's visuals were generally well-received, as was its audio. Critics took particular note of the game's voice talent, which was described as among the best found in computer games up to that time. The "Crimson Skies" universe was also well received by critics, who found it highly original and described it as an "alternate history that is rare in being both compelling and believable." Critics also commended the way these elements—voice acting, soundtrack, graphics style, and story—combined to contribute to the game's 1930s pulp fiction atmosphere.
The single player campaign in "Crimson Skies" was criticized for its overall linearity, and GameSpot found that multiple playthroughs of a mission would become "tiresome." The game was most heavily dispraised, however, for its numerous and notable technical issues, which include choppy framerate, missing textures, crash bugs, slowdown during menu screens, flawed wingman AI, long loading times for game levels, and the unreliability of saved game files.
IGN commented that "there are some serious issues with the game that need to be addressed […] in order to help the game realize its amazing potential." According to GameSpot, "Unfortunately, the game is […] a reminder of how easily technical problems can defeat a promising design." "Edge" magazine has stated that gameplay is directly affected by these problems, as long loading times force players to "play it safe" and avoid the "improbable stunts that should be the signature of game"; the review concludes it's "A shame, because in its variety of missions and sheer panache, the dashing "Crimson Skies" almost steals your heart.

Robert Browne (Elizabethan actor)

Robert Browne (died October 1603) was an English actor of the Elizabethan era, and the owner and manager of the Boar's Head Theatre. He was also part of an enduring confusion in the study of English Renaissance theatre.
Two Robert Brownes.
The relevant documents of English Renaissance drama contain numerous references to "Robert Browne." Early twentieth-century scholars, like E. K. Chambers and Edwin Nunzeger, assumed that these records referred to a single individual. Later scholars, principally Charles Jasper Sissons and Herbert Berry, argued persuasively that two separate individuals had been confused and conflated into one. Or two at least: "There were obviously at least two and could easily have been three or more Robert Brownes who had to do with the companies and playhouses of the time."
To distinguish between two Robert Brownes, the earliest years of the seventeenth century are key. One Robert Browne was busy running the Boar's Head Theatre in 1601 through 1603; another Robert Browne was performing with English actors in Germany between 1601 and 1607. The Boar's Head Browne died in 1603, and so can reasonably be termed an Elizabethan actor. The career of the "other" Robert Browne extended through the first two decades of the seventeenth century; he can sensibly be called a Jacobean actor.
The Elizabethan actor.
The Robert Browne who is the subject of this article was the man who ran the Boar's Head Theatre, and who was married to Susan Browne (later Susan Greene, later Susan Baskervile) and the father of their five children, including the actor William Browne (1602–34). Browne of the Boar's Head was in all likelihood the Browne who was a leader among the acting troupe Derby's Men, and who received payments for Court performances by Derby's Men in 1600 and 1601.
A Robert Browne wrote to Edward Alleyn in 1589; when the subject of this article died in October 1603, Joan Alleyn wrote the news to her husband. The later Robert Browne wrote to Alleyn in 1612, showing that the Alleyns knew both men. Concerning Edward Alleyn and the two Brownes, one scholar has written, "From the scanty record it would appear that the first was of particular interest to Alleyn but not on good terms, while the second appears, from occasional notes to Alleyn, to have been confident and respectful."
It is not impossible that there was a family relationship between the two Brownes, since familial connections were common among actors and theatre people in the era: consider John and Lawrence Dutton in Queen Elizabeth's Men, Anthony and Humphrey Jeffes in the Admiral's Men a generation later, plus Robert Pallant father and son (apparently), and other such pairs. To compound the confusion, both Robert Brownes had sons named Robert Browne.

Gallium nitrate

Gallium nitrate (brand name Ganite) is the gallium salt of nitric acid with the chemical formula Ga(NO3)3. It is a drug used to treat symptomatic hypercalcemia secondary to cancer. It works by preventing the breakdown of bone through the inhibition of osteoclast activity, thus lowering the amount of free calcium in the blood. Gallium nitrate is also used to synthesize other gallium compounds.
History.
Gallium (Ga) was discovered in 1875 by P.É. Lecoq de Boisbaudran. In most of its compounds, Gallium is found with an oxidation number of 3+. Gallium chemically behaves as close as Iron 3+ when contacting in a complex. That means, Gallium (III) and Iron (III) have similar coordination numbers, electrical charge, ion diameter and electron configuration.
"Bio-availability".
Gallium atoms are bound to the phosphates of DNA at low gallium concentrations leading in forming a stable complex. However, there were no interactions seen between the metal and the DNA bases. In fact, gallium competes with magnesium and acts as a competitor for DNA binding since it has an affinity for DNA 100 times higher than that of magnesium. According to Hedley et al., gallium inhibits replicative DNA synthesis, the major gallium-specific target probably being ribonucleotide reductase. In addition to that, it was reported by Chitambar that gallium binds to transferrin than that of Iron. The transferrin gallium complex inhibits the DNA synthesis by acting on the M2 subunit of the ribonucleotide reductase.
Moreover, gallium is mostly found as a salt in lysosome within the cell. It seems that gallium (III) act as antagonist to the actions of several ions (Mg2+, Fe2+ and Zn2+) for the processes of cellular metabolism. More specifically, the action of gallium in gallium nitrate on bone metabolism decreases the hypercalcemia associated with cancer.
Preparation.
Gallium nitrate is commercially available as the hydrate. The nonahydrate may also be prepared by dissolving gallium in nitric acid, followed by recrystallization. The structure of gallium nitrate nonahydrate has been determined by X-ray crystallography.
Use and manufacturing.
"Preparation of gallium nitride from gallium nitrate".
GaN powder was prepared by heating gallium nitrate salt in flowing ammonia to a high temperature that range between 500-1050 °C. The salt was converted to GaN by monitoring X-ray diffraction and Gallium magnetic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy.
"Medication Information".
Gallium nitrate injection is a clear, colorless, odorless, sterile solution of gallium nitrate, a hydrated nitrate salt of the group IIIa element, gallium. The stable, nonahydrate, Ga(N03)3•9H2O is a white, slightly hygroscopic, crystalline powder of molecular weight 417.87, that is readily soluble in water. Each mL of Ganite (gallium nitrate injection) contains gallium nitrate 25 mg (on an anhydrous basis) and sodium citrate dihydrate 28.75 mg. The solution may contain sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment to 6.0-7.0
"Overdose".
Use of higher doses of gallium nitrate than recommended may cause nausea, vomiting and increases risk of renal insufficiency. In the case of overdose, serum calcium should be monitored, patients should receive vigorous hydration for 2–3 days and any further drug administrations should be discontinued 
Treatment.
The action of gallium in gallium nitrate on bone metabolism decreases the hypercalcemia associated with cancer. Gallium inhibits osteoclastic activity and therefore decreases hydroxyapatite crystal formation, with adsorption of gallium onto the surfaces of hydroxyapatite crystals. Also, the increased concentration of gallium in the bone leads to increasing the synthesis of collagen as well as the formation of the bone tissue inside the cell. It has been reported that a protracted infusion was effective against cancer-associated hypercalcemia. Preliminary studies in bladder carcinoma, carcinoma of the urothelium and lymphomas are also promising. Another interesting schedule of subcutaneous injection with low doses of gallium nitrate has been proposed, especially for the treatment of bone metastases, but the definitive results have not yet been published.
Chemical Reactivity.
Gallium Nitrate can react with reducing agents to generate heat and products that may be gaseous. The products may themselves be capable of further reactions (such as combustion in the air). The chemical reduction of materials in this group can be rapid, but often requires initiation of heat, catalyst and addition of a solvent. Explosive mixtures of Gallium Nitrate with reducing agents often persist unchanged for long periods if initiation is prevented. Some inorganic oxidizing agents such as Gallium Nitrate are salts of metals that are soluble in water; dissolution dilutes but does not nullify the oxidizing power of such materials. Generally, inorganic oxidizing agents can react violently with active metals, cyanides, esters, and thiocyanates.
Adverse Reaction.
"Kidney".
Adverse renal effects have been reported in about 12.5% of patients treated with gallium nitrate. Two patients receiving gallium nitrate and one patient receiving calcitonin developed acute renal failure in a controlled trial of patients with cancer-related hypercalcemia. Also, it was reported that gallium nitrate should not be administered to patients with serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL.
"Blood Pressure".
In a controlled trial of patients, it was noticed a decrease in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure after the treatment with gallium nitrate. The decrease in blood pressure was asymptomatic and did not require specific treatment.
"Hematologic".
High doses of gallium nitrate were associated with anemia when used in treating patients for advanced cancer. In results, several patients have received red blood cell transfusions.

Kazem Ordoobadi

Kazem Ordoobadi is one of the last figures among the painters associated with the school founded in Iran by Mohammad Ghaffari, better known as Kamal-ol-Molk, one of Iran’s most celebrated master-painters. Kamal-ol-Molk stayed in France and Italy in the last years of the nineteenth century to study the works of Europe’s greatest artists. Kamal-ol-Molk style, inspired by his stay in Europe, is based on Realism and Naturalism. He founded the School of Fine Arts (Mostazrafe) in 1908 where European style of painting was taught together with Iran’s traditional painting. This was a breakthrough in the Iranian painting that for centuries was dominated mainly by miniatures used in illustration and decoration of books.
Early life and family.
Kazem Ordoobadi was born in 1919 and was the youngest of four children by Mohammad-Hassan Company and Rafieh Ordoobadi. Both his Grandfathers, Haj Mohammad Tajer and Haj Abbas Ordoobadi, emigrated from Nakhijevan, then part of the Russian Empire, to Iran and settled in Shiraz.
Career.
Ordoobadi started painting when he was in high school. His family had a long history of artists. His father was a skilled calligrapher and had written in the Nastaleeq () style several works of famous Iranian poets. His cousin Khalil Negargar was a refined watercolor painter.
Ordoobadi’s earliest extant work is a small watercolor painting on a cardboard dated 1941, when he was 22 years old. The perfect use of colors and space shows that healready mastered his art. Later Ordoobadi’s acquaintance with Ostad Mahmoud Olia, a distinguished disciple of Kamal-ol-Molk, opened new horizons to him. Ordoobadi painted several portraits of personalities, family members and friends. The origin of his interest in portraits should be sought in the influence of Mahmoud Olia. In particular his earlier works come very close to the works of his master in terms of technique, lighting and color rendition. However he gradually gained assurance and departed from his master towards a more personal style.
The influence of Olia however remained intact in Ordoobadi’s pencil drawings. His pencil drawing copy of Murillo’s “Inmaculada de Soult” or Rembrandt’s “self-portrait” are examples of Olia's influence. These works demonstrate the dexterity of the artist using his pencil to give life to lines and shades.
In Ordoobadi’s early oil paintings the inspirations of Olia could also be seen in the selection of colors, movements and brush strokes. His oil paintings evolved later when he got interested in landscapes and painted a number of works of the Russian realist painter Ivan Shishkin. The influence of realist landscape painters is visible in his later works depicting the life of Qashqai nomads of Fars in their natural environment.
Later on, Ordoobadi started studying impressionism and found a great interest in that school. He was impressed by the freedom in brush strokes, transparent colors and strong lights used by the masters. He painted several works in the style the French impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir and his later works were greatly influenced by this school.
Ordoobadi painted portraits of a selection of personalities which include outstanding figures associated with cultural and artistic circles of his time. His portraits of Fereydoun Tavallali (celebrated poet), Mirza Kazemi and Hashem Javid (man of letters), Naser Namazi (painter), Mohammad-Reza Moharreri (artist and doctor) show Ordoobadi’s active participation to the dynamic cultural and literary life of Shiraz.
After Obtaining his bachelor’s degree in Physics in University of Tehran Ordoobadi started his professional life as a high-school teacher. He taught Physics and Art to high school students in Shiraz for thirty years. He acted as director of the Audio-Visual institute with the mission of taking culture to the heart of Fars province’s villages and nomad regions. During his numerous trips to the remote areas of Fars he studied nomads’ lifestyle and painted some of the scenes of their day-to-day life. Later he was appointed as director of Archeological Institute of Fars province and helped to preserve the cultural heritage and historical treasures of ancient Iran. Ordoobadi died in 2002 at age of 83.

Riccardo Fogli

Riccardo Fogli (born 21 October 1947 in Pontedera, Province of Pisa, Italy) is an Italian singer.
Biography.
Early career.
Riccardo Fogli was born on 21 October 1947 in Pontedera. He was fond of music since his childhood. In the 1960s, he became a fan of The Beatles, which also influenced his decision to start his career as a singer.
In 1964, at the age of 17, Fogli joined Slenders. Two years later, in 1966, he became the lead singer of Pooh. In 1973, he left Pooh and started his solo career; however, later on he performed many songs together with Pooh, most notably "Giorni cantati" "The Days Sung Together".
In 1973, Riccardo issued his first album "Ciao amore come stai" ("Hello, Love, How Are You?"), which was followed by his second album "Riccardo Fogli" in 1976; the song "Mondo" ("World") from this album became a hit. However, it was not until the early 1980s that Fogli eventually worked out his style of performance.
1980s.
The 1980s were a pinnacle of success for Riccardo Fogli. In this period, the lyrics of his songs became more philosophical and his singing manner became more emotional. It was in the 1980s that Fogli gained overwhelming popularity both within and outside Italy. In 1981, Fogli performed one of his most famous and lyrical song, "Malinconia" ("Melancholy"), and in 1982 he was a winner at Festival di Sanremo with his another hit "Storie di tutti i giorni" ("Everyday Stories"), where he out-did even the duet of Al Bano and Romina Power with their hit "Felicità" ("Happiness"). Since then, Riccardo Fogli became world famous; his 1982 album "Collezione" ("Collection") was issued in nearly a million copies in Western Europe, Japan and the USSR, where he became particularly popular.
Riccardo Fogli participated in Eurovision Song Contest with the entry "Per Lucia" ("For Lucia") in 1983, where he finished in 11th place and received 41 points. Also, he was married to an Italian singer Viola Valentino but then divorced.

Zlil Sela

Zlil Sela is an Israeli mathematician working in the area of geometric group theory.
He is a Professor of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Sela is known for the solution of the isomorphism problem for torsion-free word-hyperbolic groups and for the solution of the Tarski conjecture about equivalence of first order theories of finitely generated non-abelian free groups.
Biographical data.
Sela received his Ph.D. in 1991 from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where his doctoral advisor was Eliyahu Rips.
Prior to his current appointment at the Hebrew University, he held an Associate Professor position at Columbia University in New York. While at Columbia, Sela won the Sloan Fellowship from the Sloan Foundation.
Sela gave an Invited Address at the 2002 International Congress of Mathematicians in Beijing. He gave a plenary talk at the 2002 annual meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic,
and he delivered an AMS Invited Address at the October 2003 meeting of the American Mathematical Society and the 2005 at the University of California at Berkeley.
He was also awarded the 2003 Erdős Prize from the Israel Mathematical Union.
Sela also received the 2008 Carol Karp Prize from the Association for Symbolic Logic for his work on the Tarski conjecture and on discovering and developing new connections between model theory and geometric group theory.
Mathematical contributions.
Sela's early important work was his solution in mid-1990s of the isomorphism problem for torsion-free word-hyperbolic groups. The machinery of group actions on real trees, developed by Eliyahu Rips, played a key role in Sela's approach. The solution of the isomorphism problem also relied on the notion of "canonical representatives" for elements of hyperbolic groups, introduced by Rips and Sela in a joint 1995 paper. The machinery of the canonical representatives allowed Rips and Sela to prove algorithmic solvability of finite systems of equations in torsion-free hyperbolic groups, by reducing the problem to solving equations in free groups where the Makanin-Razborov algorithm can be applied. The technique of canonical representatives was later generalized by Dahmani to the case of relatively hyperbolic groups and played a key role in the solution of the isomorphism problem for "toral" relatively hyprbolic groups.
In his work on the isomorphism problem Sela also introduced and developed the notion of a JSJ-decomposition for word-hyperbolic groups, motivated by the notion of a JSJ decomposition for 3-manifolds. A JSJ-decomposition is a representation of a word-hyperbolic group as the fundamental group of a graph of groups which encodes in a canonical way all possible splittings over infinite cyclic subgroups. The idea of JSJ-decomposition was later extended by Rips and Sela to torsion-free finitely presented groups and this work gave rise a systematic development of the JSJ-decomposition theory with many further extensions and generalizations by other mathematicians. Sela applied a combination of his JSJ-decomposition and real tree techniques to prove that torsion-free word-hyperbolic groups are Hopfian. This result and Sela's approach were later generalized by others to finitely generated subgroups of hyperbolic groups and to the setting of relatively hyperbolic groups.
Sela's most important work came in early 2000s when he produced a solution to a famous Tarski conjecture. Namely, in a long series of papers, he proved that any two non-abelian finitely generated free groups have the same first-order theory. Sela's work relied on applying his earlier JSJ-decomposition and real tree techniques as well as developing new ideas and machinery of "algebraic geometry" over free groups.
Sela pushed this work further to study first-order theory of arbitrary torsion-free word-hyperbolic groups and to characterize all groups that are elementarily equivalent to (that is, have the same first order theory as) a given torsion-free word-hyperbolic group. In particular, his work implies that if a finitely generated group "G" is elementarily equivalent to a word-hyperbolic group then "G" is word-hyperbolic as well.
Sela also proved that the first order theory of a finitely generated free group is stable in the model-theoretic sense, providing a brand-new and qualitatively different source of examples for the stability theory.
An alternative solution for the Tarski conjecture has been presented by Olga Kharlampovich and Alexei Myasnikov.
The work of Sela on first-order theory of free and word-hyperbolic groups substantially influenced the development of geometric group theory, in particular by stimulating the development and the study of the notion of limit groups and of relatively hyperbolic groups.

The Crisis (novel)

The Crisis is an historical novel published in 1901 by the American novelist Winston Churchill. It was the best-selling book in the United States in 1901. The novel is set in the years leading up to the first battles of the U.S. Civil War, mostly in the divided state of Missouri. It follows the fortunes of young Stephen Brice, a man with Union and abolitionist sympathies, and his involvement with a Southern family.
Story.
Set in the author's home town of St. Louis, Missouri, the site of pivotal events in the western theater of the Civil War, with historically prominent citizens having both Northern and Southern sympathies. St. Louis was also the pre-war home of both Ulysses Grant and William T. Sherman, each of whom is depicted in the book.
Romantic tension develops between the four main characters: one, Virginia Carvel, the fashionable daughter of Comyn Carvel, a southern gentleman of the old school; another, Clarence Maxwell Colfax, her n'er-do-well cousin who becomes a stalwart cavalier in the Southern cause in an effort to win Ginny's approval; the third, Stephen A. Brice, an earnest young lawyer from Boston who antagonizes Virginia by his zeal for Abraham Lincoln's cause; and the fourth, Eliphalet Hopper, a hard-working clerk with ambitions to advance himself both financially and socially.
The crisis of the title is provoked by Abraham Lincoln's opposition to the extension of slavery, and the power of his personal integrity to win people to his cause, including the young lawyer Brice, who becomes a devoted admirer and proponent following a personal interview on the eve of the Freeport debate between Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. This meeting depicts Lincoln's determination to advance the cause of freedom through the possible (and likely) sacrifice of his own political ambitions, and is related with a very believable combination of rustic humor and political acumen on Lincoln's part.
The events prior to Lincoln’s nomination and his eventual election to the Presidency elicit different reactions among the citizens of St. Louis, from the determined antipathy of the Southern sympathizers, to the equally determined patriotism of the population of German immigrants who have fled from their homeland and whose devotion to liberty has caused them to transfer their allegiance to the ideal of American democracy. One of them is Stephen's fellow lawyer, Karl Richter, who bears the scar of a duel fought with broadswords between himself and an arrogant German noble; a duel based on an actual incident in Berlin.
Although the personal rivalries follow an almost soap opera style formula, the overall events of the war from the perspective of St. Louis and the Western theater of war are dramatically depicted with well-researched authenticity, and both Grant and Sherman are depicted as having a personal involvement in the lives of the main characters. A pivotal moment in the heroine's life is presented through her transformation from being self-centered and self-absorbed to becoming self-sacrificing and dedicated to easing the suffering of those around her. This is represented as a Christian metaphor for the way that God uses challenges to mould a person's character.
In the end, Virginia and the young lawyer find themselves meeting Lincoln together to try to save her cousin's life after Clarence is condemned as a Southern spy, and together they experience Lincoln's power to bring about a reconciliation between them, just before the national reconciliation which Lincoln proposed between the North and the South would be aborted by John Wilkes Booth's bullet.
This novel is a story about Abraham Lincoln in the same sense that the novel is "a tale of the Christ," in that Lincoln only appears twice, for a total of about two dozen pages, but his philosophy is a dynamic presence throughout the story. The author portrays Lincoln as being the sacrifice America had to pay to redeem it from the sin of slavery. In his post-script, the author offers this justification for supporting Lincoln's point of view, "Lincoln loved both the South and the North".
Reception.
The book received good reviews, and was the best-selling book in the United States for 1901, according to the "The Bookman" magazine.
Film.
The book was adapted into a silent film of the same name in 1916.

SAI KZ II

__NOTOC__
The SAI KZ II was a sport aircraft built in Denmark in 1937, produced in three major versions before and after the Second World War. In its original form, designated the Kupé (Danish: "Coupé") it was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional design with fixed tailwheel undercarriage and two seats side-by-side under an enclosed canopy. the fuselage structure was of steel tube, skinned in plywood and fabric, and the wings were wooden with plywood covering and could be folded back along the fuselage for transport and storage. 
This was followed by the aerobatic KZ II Sport with a revised fuselage design, placing the two seats in separate open cockpits in tandem, and a dedicated military trainer version along the same lines, the KZ II "Træner" ("Trainer"). This latter type was first produced in 1946, as a step towards rebuilding Denmark's air force after the war. They remained in service until 1955, when nine examples were sold into private hands.
In 2008, an example of each variant (including the sole extant KZ II Sport) is preserved in the Danmarks Flymuseum.

Federal Correctional Institution, Miami

The Federal Correctional Institution, Miami (FCI Miami) is a low-security United States federal prison for male inmates in Florida. It is operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), a division of the United States Department of Justice. The institution also has an adjacent satellite prison camp that houses minimum-security male offenders.
FCI Miami is located in southwest Miami-Dade County, Florida, about 30 miles from downtown Miami.
A significant portion of the inmates held at FCI Miami have been convicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
History.
FCI Miami was opened in 1976. Federal Bureau of Prisons officials used the facility to house some of the people who emigrated to Florida from Cuba during the Mariel Boatlift in 1980. The number of refugees eventually reached over 100,000 and many of the refugees had criminal records. The facility did not have nearly enough capacity to hold even a significant portion of the refugees, so the Bureau of Prisons, with the assistance of the military and other federal agencies, created detention camps inside and outside Florida to house them.
Notable incidents.
On December 20, 2011, Jack Chris Jackson pleaded guilty to the charge of sexual abuse of a ward for having a year-long sexual relationship with an inmate under his supervision while he was a correction officer at FCI Miami. Jackson, who was terminated after the relationship was discovered, was sentenced to prison and released in February 2013.

Orio Palmer

Orio Joseph Palmer (March 2, 1956 – September 11, 2001) was a Battalion Chief of the New York City Fire Department who died while rescuing occupants of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Palmer led the team of firefighters that reached the 78th floor of the South Tower, the floor where the plane had struck the building.
According to "The 9/11 Commission Report", audio and video recordings prominently featuring Orio Palmer have played an important role in the ongoing analysis of problems with radio communications during the September 11 attacks.
Family and education.
Reporter Michael Daly wrote, "The 45-year-old Palmer was one of the department's rising stars, renowned for his smarts and nerve and decency, as well as his physical fitness." He was married to Debbie Palmer, and had three children, Dana, Keith and Alyssa. They lived in Valley Stream, New York.
According to John Norman, Palmer was very fit and ran marathon races. Historian Peter Charles Hoffer wrote that Palmer was "in superb condition". Palmer finished the New York City marathon as well as a dozen half-marathons and a couple of triathlons. Orio was also the first FDNY member to be awarded the department’s physical fitness award five times, resulting in it being renamed the “Orio Palmer Memorial Fitness Award” in his memory after September 11th, 2001.
Palmer was one of the "most knowledgeable people in the department" about radio communication in high-rise fires. He graduated from Cardinal Spellman High School in The Bronx, NY in 1974. He "held an associate's degree in electrical technology, and had written a training article for the department on how to use repeaters to boost radio reception at high-rise fires." Palmer was also published in a number of nationally distributed firefighting magazines as well as the internal FDNY newsletter. He also taught FDNY promotional classes at night while working toward his own bachelor's degree in Fire Engineering from John Jay College.
September 11.
North Tower lobby.
Footage of Palmer was used in the CBS film "9/11", and later in the HBO film "In Memoriam: New York City, 9/11/01". The video footage was shot by French documentary filmmakers Jules and Gedeon Naudet at the North Tower. It shows Palmer conferring with Deputy Chief Peter Hayden and Assistant Chief Donald Burns at the North Tower. The South Tower had just been hit. The men discuss how to respond to the two towers, and the communications problems they faced. The sound of a falling body hitting pavement outside reverberates. According to Michael Daly, "Palmer stood steady and calm, an air pack on his back, a red flashlight bound with black elastic to his white helmet, a radio in his left hand. His face showed only a readiness to do whatever was needed." The men decided that Burns and Palmer would proceed to the South Tower.
Ascent of South Tower.
After arriving at the South Tower of the World Trade Center, Palmer single-handedly fixed an elevator and took it up to the 41st floor sky lobby. Once there, he went on to run up 37 flights of stairs to reach the plane’s impact zone on the 78th floor. Orio was met there by Fire Marshal Ronald Paul Bucca; they were the only first responders to reach the impact zone that day. There he reported, “Numerous 10-45s, code ones” or fatalities. Orio directed survivors of the impact how to get out of the building, relayed essential information to firemen below over the radio in an attempt to form a strategy to combat the flames and evacuate survivors, and brought comfort to those stuck and injured on the 78th floor by assuring them that help was coming.
When an audiotape of communication with the firefighters was released, it revealed that firefighters did not anticipate the building's collapse. Palmer, issuing an order to one of his subordinates, was recorded seconds before the building collapsed. Peter Charles Hoffer described Palmer's professionalism during the final moments of his life: "Listening to Palmer and his comrades on the recovered tape, one can hear the urgency of men working at high efficiency, but there was never a hint that the clock was running out on them."
Transcripts of Palmer's last broadcast were published in 2002. The actual recordings were made public in 2005, as the result of a lawsuit filed by "The New York Times" and families of some of the firefighters killed on September 11. Monica Gabrielle of the Skyscraper Safety Campaign commented on the release of the tapes: "Today we are one step closer to learning what happened on 9/11 in NYC — where we excelled, where we failed."
According to "The Times" of London, "Chief Palmer made it to the impact zone on the 78th floor of the south tower before the building collapsed. Once there the battalion chief reported 'Numerous 10–45s, Code Ones' — fire department code for dead people."
Palmer's brother-in-law, Jim McCaffrey, is also a firefighter, a Lieutenant in Ladder 31. When new tapes were made public in 2006, his advice to family members was quoted, based on his family's experience first listening to the last recording of Palmer: "It was emotional sitting with my wife and sister-in-law, listening to the tapes. You're hearing him right at that point prior to the collapse, about the things he saw on the 78th floor. Before that, we didn't even know he got higher than the 40th floor."
Role in analysis of 9/11.
In 2004, "The 9/11 Commission Report" relied on analysis of the North Tower lobby conversations between Palmer, Peter Hayden and Donald Burns in the film shot by Jules and Gedeon Naudet to better understand what was and was not working in the fire department's communications in those critical minutes. The report stated that, "Of particular concern to the chiefs—in light of FDNY difficulties in responding to the 1993 bombing—was communications capability. One of the chiefs recommended testing the repeater channel to see if it would work." Peter Hayden, who survived, later testified, "People watching on TV certainly had more knowledge of what was happening a hundred floors above us than we did in the lobby... ithout critical information coming in... it's very difficult to make informed, critical decisions".
The 9/11 Commission carefully analyzed the FDNY radio communications that day, and reported that the battalion chief (Palmer) was able to maintain radio communication that "worked well" with the senior chief in the lobby of the South Tower during the first fifteen minutes of his ascent. A message from a World Trade Center security official that the impact was on the 78th floor was relayed to Palmer, and he decided to try to take his team to that level. Beginning at 9:21 AM, Palmer was no longer able to reach the lobby command post, but his transmissions were recorded and analyzed later. He reached the 78th floor sky lobby, and his team not far behind him were able to free a group of civilians trapped in an elevator at 9:58 AM. Palmer radioed that the area was open to the 79th floor, "well into the impact zone", and reported "numerous civilian fatalities in the area". One minute later, at 9:59 AM, the South Tower collapsed, killing everyone still inside.
Michael Daly concluded that Palmer, "an uncommonly brave fire chief who was one of the department's most knowledgeable minds in communications perished never knowing of warnings telephoned by at least two callers less than 30 stories above him."
Although they lost their lives themselves, Palmer and his crew had played an "indispensable role in ensuring calm in the stairwells, assisting the injured and guiding the evacuees on the lower floors."
Legacy.
At the National 9/11 Memorial, Palmer is memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-17.

Dance parade

Dance parade is an annual parade and festival that showcases dance of all kinds as an expression of art and culture. It takes place in New York City each May, on the Saturday before Memorial Day.
Background.
Greg Miller, a social entrepreneur and dance aficionado, established the non-profit organization in December, 2006 and led an all-volunteer group that produced the inaugural parade on May 19, 2007. Over 2300 dancers from 75 organizations made their way down Manhattan’s Broadway and Fifth Avenue on and around eight floats. Ending in front of the Washington Square Memorial Arch, the parade culminated in 31 performances highlighting native New York dance styles such as hip-hop, jazz dance, break dancing, and salsa. Participants included the original B-boys, and Kevin Smith; DJs Danny Tenaglia and Kool Herc; and Frieda Williams.
As defined by its Board of Directors (Mahayana Landowne, Trevor Hochman and Greg Miller), Dance parade’s mission is “to promote dance as an expressive and unifying art form by showcasing all forms of dance, educating the general public about the opportunities to experience dance, and celebrating diversity of dance in New York City by sponsoring a yearly city-wide dance parade and dance festival”.
In 2007, with Washington Square Park under renovation, the parade terminated in Tompkins Square Park. With the support of New York State Governor David Paterson and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the second annual Dance Parade drew 108 organizations representing 31 styles of dance, ten floats, and over 4,000 dancers. Jazz dance legend Luigi was the Grand Marshal, accompanied by Miss Dance USA, the New York Knicks City Dancers, as well as ballerinas, salsaros, and club kids. Thirty-nine performances took place on stage in the park, and workshops gave the public the chance to learn dance.
The 2010 Dance Parade took place on Saturday May 22. The parade featured swing dancing, samba, tango, pole dancers and more.
Participation is free and open to all who sign up at the official website.
Every April 29, the organizers celebrate International Dance Day with a fundraiser and performances. As an all volunteer 501(c)3 non-profit organization, the organization relies on public and private support.

Dave Phillips (ice hockey)

David Phillips (born 14 August 1987 in Beverley, England) is a British professional ice hockey defenceman, currently playing for the Belfast Giants of the British Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL).
Playing career.
Phillips began his career within the Kingston-upon-Hull club in England, playing for Kingston Crunch U-16, Kingston Predators U-19 and then Kingston Jets of the English National League in November 2003. He then moved up to the Hull Stingrays in the British National League, a team which joined the Elite League in 2006. Phillips established himself as one of Britain's top defencemen and served as assistant captain of the Stingrays in the 2007–08 season. He moved to the Belfast Giants for the 2008–09 season, becoming new coach Steve Thornton's first signing. Establishing a career high 25 points in 54 games, Phillips helped the Giants to be crowned Champions of the Challenge Cup and Knockout Cup.
On 28 April 2009, Phillips re-signed to remain with the Giants for the following season. However, with NHL ambitions, and following an impressive performance in an Chicago Blackhawks evaluation camp, Phillips was signed to a two-way contract with American Hockey League affiliate team, the Rockford IceHogs on 12 July 2009. He participated on an invitation in the Blackhawks training camp, before returning to the IceHogs to begin the 2009–10 season. After making his North American debut against the Peoria Rivermen on 4 October 2009, Phillips was briefly loaned to ECHL team Toledo Walleye, scoring his first North American professional goal, before he was recalled to the IceHogs to remain for the majority of the season posting 6 assists in 52 games. 
On 8 April 2010, it was confirmed that Phillips had agreed to a one-year deal with fellow AHL team, the Chicago Wolves for the 2010–11 season. Phillips was then assigned to the Walleye of the ECHL to begin the 2010 season. After appearing in one game with the Wolves in November he was returned to Toledo. With only 5 points in 31 games with the Walleye, on 12 November, Phillips was re-assigned by the Wolves to fellow ECHL team, the Gwinnett Gladiators. On 25 December, Dave was released from his contract with the Wolves and shortly joined fellow AHL team, the Lake Erie Monsters, on a professional try out on 5 January 2011. After posting 3 assists in 10 games with the Monsters, Phillips returned to the Gladiators. Towards the end of his first stint with the Monsters, Phillips signed with Australian based team, the Adelaide Adrenaline, for the forthcoming 2011 season on 12 January 2011.
On 10 May 2011 it was announced that Phillips would be returning to Britain and the Elite Ice Hockey League with the Coventry Blaze.

Hill Country State Natural Area

Hill Country State Natural Area (HCSNA) preserves of rugged Hill Country terrain in Bandera County, Texas. It was first opened to the public in 1984. Since HCSNA is designated a "Natural Area" rather than a "State Park", the Texas Parks and Wildlife Dept.'s first priority is the maintenance and preservation of the property's natural state. Accordingly, facilities are purposely somewhat primitive and recreational activities may be curtailed if the TPWD deems it necessary to protect the environment.
Location.
Hill Country State Natural Area is located on the border of Bandera County and Medina County, approximately 10 miles (16 km) southwest of Bandera, Texas, 20 miles (32 km) north of Hondo, Texas, and 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of San Antonio, Texas,
Geography and Geology.
Set in the scenic hills and canyons typical of the Texas Hill Country, the preserve lies about ten miles north of the Balcones escarpment and within the Balcones Fault Zone. The elevation ranges from approximately . The local Woodard Cave Fault runs through the property on a general east-west line. The terrain of the area consists of eroded limestone hills and mesas, typical landforms of the Hill Country. There are also relatively flat bottomland areas surrounding the small creeks that drain the property. The local bedrock is exposed throughout much of the preserve. The highest hilltops, and the lower hills in the southern part of the Natural Area, are capped by fairly resistant limestone of the Fort Terret formation within the Edwards Group, which is the dominant bedrock of the Edwards Plateau to the north. The rest of the preserve lies atop the softer, more easily eroded Upper Glen Rose Formation, also a limestone. Both are flat-lying, fossiliferous formations dating from the Cretaceous Period.
Flora and fauna.
The Natural Area supports eight recognized plant community types and over 450 plant species. The majority of the preserve is covered by Texas Live Oak ("Quercus fusiformis") and Ashe Juniper ("Juniperus ashei")...commonly called "cedar"... woodlands, Live Oak savannah, Texas Red Oak ("Quercus buckleyi") woodlands, and open grasslands composed primarily of Sideoats Grama ("Bouteloua curtipendula" and Little bluestem ("Schizachyrium scoparium"). Smaller communities include stands of Lacey Oak ("Quercus laceyi"), Pecan ("Carya illinoinensis")-Sugarberry ("Celtis laevigata") groves, and Gramagrass-Switchgrass ("Panicum virgatum") grasslands, as well as fields of Sotol ("Dasylirion wheeleri"). The natural vegetation of the property, like much of the Texas Hill Country, has suffered from overgrazing and the introduction of invasive species like exotic King Ranch Bluestem ("Bothriochloa ischaemum" var. "songarica") and the previously mentioned Ashe Juniper. 
HCSNA affords good opportunities for bird watching. Over 160 species of birds have been sighted in the preserve, including two endangered bird species, the Golden-cheeked Warbler ("Dendroica chrysoparia") and the Black-capped Vireo ("Vireo atricapilla"). 
As in much of the Hill Country, White-tailed deer ("Odocoileus virginianus") are by far the most common large mammal on the property. Wild turkeys, armadillos, skunks, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, and fox squirrels are also present. Feral pigs, exotic fallow deer, porcupines, rock squirrels, and ringtailed cats can occasionally be encountered. Bobcats, coyotes, grey foxes, and very rarely, mountain lions inhabit the area, but are seldom seen by visitors.
History.
The land within the preserve has been inhabited for several thousand years, and a number of Native American artifacts have been found on the property, including human remains. After the arrival of European settlers in the mid-1800s, the area became part of a working ranch. The bottomlands were converted to cropland and the remainder was used for grazing. Eventually becoming the Bar-O Ranch, several parcels of land were subsequently donated by Louise Merrick between 1976 and 1982 to establish the Hill Country State Natural Area. Ms. Merrick stipulated that the property was “"to be kept far removed and untouched by modern civilization, where everything is preserved intact, yet put to a useful purpose."” The preserve was opened to the public in 1984 with . In 1986 a further were acquired, bringing the total size to the current .
Recreation.
HCSNA has over of multi-use trails and permits hiking, biking and horseback riding. Equestrian facilities are available (see the TPWD - Hill Country State Natural Area website in the "External links" below for more details). Several dude ranches adjoin the property and regularly lead hikes and trail rides through the Natural Area. The beautiful, but intermittent, West Verde Creek runs through the preserve, allowing for swimming and fishing when water levels are high enough. For herd management purposes, TPWD conducts controlled deer hunting by a limited number of hunters during a few weekends each season. HCSNA also hosts the annual Bandera 100 km ultramarathon run in January
HCSNA urges all visitors to respect the LEAVE NO TRACE set of wilderness ethics: "1)" Plan Ahead and Prepare, "2)" Travel on Marked Trails Only, "3)" Always Dispose of Waste Properly, "4)" Leave Behind What You Find, "5)" Never Build An Open Fire, "6)" Respect Wildlife, and "7)" Be Considerate of Other Visitors.
"Be ethical...leave no trace!"
Camping.
Consistent with its designation as a "natural area", the site is deliberately left largely undeveloped and natural, relative to a typical state park. Camping is limited to nine walk-in campsites, three small hike-in camping areas, and five equestrian campsites with horse pens. The campsites and camping areas lack sewer, electric, and potable water hookups. There is a group lodge with electric hookups, but it also lacks potable water.

Intratubular germ cell neoplasia

Intratubular germ cell neoplasia, abbreviated ITGCN or IGCN and also known as testicular intratubular germ cell neoplasia and intratubular germ cell neoplasia of the testis, is considered a precursor lesion for many types of testicular germ cell tumors.
The common, unspecified variant of the entity was once considered to be a carcinoma in situ although the term "carcinoma "in situ"" is no longer preferred for ITGCN, unspecified type (ITGCNU) lesions because they are not epithelial lesions.
Classification.
The World Health Organisation classification of testicular tumours subdivides ITGCN into (1) a more common, unspecified type (ITGCNU), and (2) other specific subtypes. The most common specific subtypes are intratubular embryonal carcinoma and intratubular seminoma.
Cancer risk.
ITGCNU is seen in the following settings:
Germ cell tumors that do not arise from ITGCNU.
Not all germ cell tumors (GCTs) arise from "intratubular germ cell neoplasia". The following testicular GCTs do not arise from ITGCN:
Diagnosis.
ITGCN is not palpable, and not visible on macroscopic examination of testicular tissue. Microscopic examination of affected testicular tissue most commonly shows germ cells with enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and clear cytoplasm. These cells are typically arranged along the basement membrane of the tubule, and mitotic figures are frequently seen. The sertoli cells are pushed toward the lumen by the neoplastic germ cells, and spermatogenesis is almost always absent in the affected tubules. Pagetoid spread of ITCGN into the rete testis is common. Immunostaining with placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) highlights ITGCNU cell membranes in 95 percent of cases. OCT3/4 is a sensitive and specific nuclear stain of ITGCNU.
Treatment.
ITGCN is generally treated by radiation therapy and/or orchiectomy. Chemotherapy used for metastatic germ cell tumours may also eradicate ITGCN.

Hau Nui Wind Farm

The Hau Nui Wind Farm is a 15-turbine wind farm located approximately south-east of Martinborough, in the South Wairarapa District of New Zealand. Hau Nui (Māori for "big wind") was the first wind farm built in New Zealand.
The wind farm was built in two stages and the completed capacity is 8.65 MW.
Site.
Hau Nui wind farm is located on a ridge adjacent to White Rock Road, the main road between Martinborough and White Rock. Stage 1 is situated on Range Road near its intersection with White Rock Road. Stage 2 is located approximately one kilometre south of Stage 1 on Range Road.
The site has an average wind speed of .
Turbines.
Hau Nui has a total of fifteen Enercon E-40 wind turbines. The seven Stage 1 turbines are third-generation turbines, delivering 550 kW each. The eight Stage 2 turbines are later versions of the same Enercon E-40 model, each generating 600 kW each.
The turbines in both stages are tall to the hub, and have rotor diameters of .
Transmission.
Electricity generated by Hau nui is injected into the local distribution grid. The 400V electricity generated by each turbine is stepped up by transformers at the base of the turbine - to 11,000V for stage 1 turbines and 33,000V for stage 2 turbines.
33kV lines from stage 2 take electricity to Martinborough to supply the town. Stage 1 turbines connect to 11 kV lines to supply the local area, or connect to the Stage 2 to Martinborough 33 kV lines through a 750 kVA transformer to the north side of the stage.
During peak demand, electricity generated by Hau Nui is used by Martinborough and the eastern South Wairarapa district. During off-peak, Hau Nui electricity can supply the entire South Wairarapa district via 33kV lines connecting Martinborough with Featherston, Greytown, and Pirinoa. If local demand is low, some electricity may be exported to the national grid through Transpower's Greytown substation.

Dutch Smoushond

The Dutch Smoushond ("Hollandse Smoushond", "Dutch Ratter") is a small breed of dog, descended from a type of terrier-like dog kept in stables to eliminate rats and mice in Germany and the Netherlands. They are considered to be related to the Schnauzer. It is very rare and not well-known outside the Netherlands, its country of origin.
Appearance.
The "Dutch Smoushond" is small in size, at the maximum 10 kg in weight and 43 cm at the withers. Its waterproof coat is rough and shaggy, and of any shade of yellow colour. The characteristic shape of the head is broad and short, with drop ears set high on the head.
History.
The Hollandse Smoushond Club (Smoushondenclub) was formed in 1905 to document and register the small stable dog as a purebred breed, as it was in danger of dying out. Its origins may have been with the ancestor of the Schnauzer breed, as an incorrect yellow colour. The name refers to its shaggy fur and face, as Jewish men (called "Smouzen" in the 1800s) had beards and long hair. They were called "Dutch" to prevent confusion with the similar Belgian griffons. During World War II, the breed nearly disappeared. In 1973, several breeders began to reconstruct the breed with the few remaining dogs, most of whom had been crossbred with other breeds. Much of the reconstruction was accomplished with the use of Border Terrier crosses.
There is illustrated reference to the breed in Dutch artist Rien Poortvliet's popular 1996 book, "Dogs."
Recognition.
Although popular in the Netherlands, the breed is not well known elsewhere in the world. It was recognised in 2001 by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and placed in Group 2, Section 1, "Pinscher and Schnauzer". Of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, it is recognised only by the United Kennel Club in the United States (in its Terrier Group.) It also may be found listed by some of the vast number of internet based minor registries and dog registry businesses as a "rare breed".

Charles George Gass

Squadron Leader Charles George Gass MC (18 April 1898 – March 1977) was the highest scoring observer ace during the First World War, with a total of 39 victories (16 solo) scored serving as a gunner flying with various pilots. After working in the Post Office between the wars, he was recalled to the Royal Air Force in early 1940.
Early life and First World War.
Gass was born in Chelsea, London in April 1898. He originally joined the 2/24th Battalion, London Regiment of the Territorial Force and became a sergeant, the rank he held when he first entered a theatre of war on 25 June 1916.Copies of these medal cards are also available from ancestry.com (subscription required), only these copies show the additional details on the reverse of the card</ref> He was then commissioned as a second lieutenant in 17th Battalion, London Regiment, and attached to the Royal Flying Corps from 1917. On 26 March 1918, he was assigned to No. 22 Squadron as an observer on Bristol F.2bs, flying in France. The two seater "Brisfit" had a maximum speed of 123 mph, which made it as fast or faster than most enemy fighters, and was manoeuvrable to boot. It had a forward pointing Vickers machine gun for the pilot, and one or two Lewis machine guns that could be slid around on their Scarff ring mount by the observer/gunner to cover a wide field of fire.
Aerial victories.
Gass soon showed his proficiency with the Lewis guns. He began by driving an Albatros D.V down out of control on 22 April 1918. Then he began one of the most spectacular months in World War I aerial warfare. 
On 7 May, Gass was gunner on a Bristol piloted by ace Alfred Atkey; Gass was in Atkey's plane by Atkey's request. They flew one of two Brisfits that took on 20 German scouts. Gass and Atkey destroyed five of the attackers, sending two of them down in burning meteors of falling wreckage.
He nailed another German on the 8th while teamed with John Everard Gurdon. Then on the 9th, he and Atkey repeated themselves. Once again they flamed two Germans; additionally, they destroyed another German and drove two down out of the battle.
They then reeled off a series of multiple victory days. Two on the 15th; three on the 19th; three more on the 20th; two each on the 22nd, 30th, and 31st; three on the 27th. Gass had scored 28 times in the month, all but one in conjunction with Atkey. No one in World War I scored more victories in a single month. He officially transferred to the nascent Royal Air Force on 22 May 1918.
Gass and Atkey scored another double on 2 June, which were Atkey's final victories. Then Gass was teamed with Lieutenant Edwin Babbage, and scored twice on the 5th. On 26 July, he shot down another German while teamed with Lieutenant Samuel Thompson.
In August, he was teamed with Lieutenant John Everard Gurdon, who had been the pilot of the other Brisfit on 7 May. They tallied five wins together, with the last coming on 13 August. Gass was transferred for pilot training soon after, but the war ended before he qualified for his wings.
Gass's final tally totalled 39. Broken down, they amounted to 5 destroyed in flames, including one victory which was shared with other planes; 12 others destroyed; 22 down "out of control".
It was the sort of performance that had garnered multiple decorations for single seat fighter pilots. For Gass, it brought a Military Cross gazetted on 16 September 1918, the citation read:
He received his MC from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 16 November 1918.
Interwar period.
Gass ceased to be actively employed by the RAF on 11 April 1919, and relinquished his Territorial commission in 17th Battalion, London Regiment on 30 September 1921. He lived in South London after the war, the address given for despatch of his campaign medals was 95 Flood Street, Chelsea. He married Geraldine Marie Insani in the Fulham registration district in the second quarter of 1921.</ref> He joined the civil service as a Post Office clerk on 27 June 1922. He joined the Reserve of Air Force Officers as a pilot officer on 30 March 1925, and was promoted flying officer on 6 May, he left the reserve on 30 September 1928. His wife petitioned for divorce in 1934, they had had two sons, Geoffrey in 1922 and Donald in 1924.</ref>
Second World War and after.
With the Second World War escalating, Gass was recommissioned as a pilot officer in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch, RAF Volunteer Reserve on 8 January 1940. He was promoted war substantive flying officer on 7 September 1940, and confirmed in that rank on 8 January 1941. He was later promoted flight lieutenant, and on 1 January 1944, temporary squadron leader. He remarried, to Kathleen Fitzgerald, in the first quarter of 1944.</ref> He finally retired from the RAFVR on 10 August 1954, retaining the rank of squadron leader.

Balthasar van der Ast

Balthasar van der Ast (1593/94 – 7 March 1657) was a Dutch Golden Age painter who specialized in still lifes of flowers and fruit, as well as painting a number of remarkable shell still lifes; he is considered to be a pioneer in the genre of shell painting. His still lifes often contain insects and lizards. He was born in Middelburg and died at Delft.
His lifetime of works was once summarized by an Amsterdam doctor who said, "In flowers, shells and lizards, beautiful".
Biography.
Balthasar van der Ast was born in Middelburg in the Southern Dutch province of Zeeland, in the family of a prosperous wool merchant. His birth was not recorded, but years later, on June 30, 1618, his older brother Jacob’s legal action indicated that Balthasar was around 25 years old at the time, making his birth date 1593 or 1594. His father, Hans, was a widower, and when he died in 1609, Bathasar moved in with his older sister, Maria, and his brother-in-law, the prominent Dutch painter Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder (1573–1621), whom Maria married in 1604. Van der Ast was trained by Bosschaert as a still life painter, and his early works clearly show Bosschaert’s influence. In turn, the three sons of Ambrosius Bosschaert, Ambrosius the Younger (1609–1645), Johannes (ca. 1612/13-1628 or later), and Abraham (1606-1683/84) were trained by van der Ast upon the death of their father. Together, this group of painters is sometimes referred to as the “Bosschaert dynasty”.
Van der Ast accompanied the Bosschaert family in their move in 1615 to Bergen op Zoom and in 1619 to Utrecht, where van der Ast entered the Utrecht Guild of St. Luke. Roelandt Savery (1576–1639) entered the St. Luke’s guild in Utrecht at about the same time. Savery, had considerable influence on van der Ast and his pupils in the years to come, especially in van der Ast’s interest in tonality. Besides the Bosschaerts, his pupils were Anthony Claesz and Johannes Baers. It is also likely that Jan Davidsz de Heem (1606-1683/84) was van der Ast’s pupil in Utrecht. He also influenced Willem and Evert van Aelst, and Bartholomeus Assteyn.
Van der Ast remained in Utrecht until 1632, when he moved to Delft and joined the guild of St Luke on 22 June 1633. On February 26, 1633 he married Margrieta Jans van Buijeren. They had two children, Maria and Helena. In Delft, van der Ast and family lived in the house on Cellebroerstraat until 1640, and in the house in Oude Delft until his death in 1657, when he was buried in the Oude Kerk.

Khalid Abdullah, a Sudanese-Egyptian, was the fiancé of Canadian Zaynab Khadr, and a suspect in the 1996 attack on the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan.
In July 1995, Ahmed Khadr arranged for his daughter Zaynab to marry Abdullah in December. Her mother Maha el-Samnah began preparing an apartment for the couple in the family's house, and Abdullah lived with the family for two months, "like a trial engagement".
Abdullah was 26 at the time of the bombing, and was believed to have purchased one of the trucks used in the attack. He fled to Lahore after the attack, and disappeared. 
He re-surfaced in Tehran in October 1997, and contacted the Khadr family to try to re-schedule the wedding he had missed. Ahmed agreed to bring his family on a long vacation culminating in the city for a farewell to the reluctant Zaynab as she started a new life with Abdullah.
Six months after the couple began living in a rented Tehran apartment, Abdullah phoned his father-in-law to report that Zaynab was inconsolable at being separated from her family, and the marriage wasn't working out. She returned to live with her family.
In 1999, he was arrested in Pakistan, and was one of hundreds extradited to the Egyptian "Returnees from Albania" tribunal. He was sentenced to a lengthy prison term.

Cwmystwyth Mines

Cwmystwyth mines are located in Cwmystwyth, Ceredigion, Wales. 
Mining heritage.
Cwm Ystwyth is considered the most important non-ferrous metal mining site in Wales providing a premier example of mining heritage in Ceredigion. Within the site there is evidence for all phases of mining activity; from the Bronze Age, through the medieval period, to its revival in the 18th century and the peak of activity with a subsequent decline in the late 19th and the early 20th century. It has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The site also features prominently in the Upland Ceredigion Landscape of Historic Interest.
History.
Silver, lead and zinc have been mined in the valley of the River Ystwyth since Roman times, an activity that reached its peak in the 18th century. The largest of the very many mines was Cwmystwyth Mine. It is reputed that the average age at death of the miners in Cwmystwyth was 32, largely because of acute lead poisoning. There is no longer any active metal mining in the Ystwyth valley.
Water use.
Water was extensively used during the silver and lead mining process to extract the ore. In the case of Cwm Ystwyth mine, much of the water was brought in by contour hugging leats from several miles upstream. The channel of the leat can still be followed on the hillside and is clearly visible from the road on the opposite side of the valley. Much of the water was used for hushing, prospecting and working the ore in the open.
Banc Ty'nddôl sun-disc.
In October 2002 the Banc Ty'nddôl sun-disc was discovered on the mining site. The disc is over 4,000 years old, which makes it the earliest gold artifact discovered in Wales.

Komagata Maru ( "Komagata Maru") was a steamship owned by the Shinyei Kisen Goshi Kaisya of Japan. She was built as a cargo ship in 1890 and had previously been known as both SS "Stubbenhuk" and SS "Sicilia while sailing for two different German owners. She was later renamed Heian Maru". She was wrecked at Cape Soyedomari, Hokkaidō, Japan, on 11 February 1926.
History.
She was launched by Charles Connell and Company of Scotstoun on 13 August 1890. Upon completion in September 1890, she was delivered to the German company Dampfschiff Rederei Hansa of Hamburg, and was registered under the name SS "Stubbenhuk". She was subsequently acquired by the Hamburg America Line of Germany, where she sailed as the SS "Sicilia" from 1894.
She was acquired by the Shinyei Kisen Goshi Kaisha company in 1913. The company was owned by four or five individuals who possessed one other ship. She was renamed the "Komagata Maru".
In 1914 the "Komagata Maru" was central to what became known as the "Komagata Maru" Incident, which involved 354 passengers from India who unsuccessfully attempted to immigrate to Canada. To accommodate the passengers, the lower deck was cleaned and fitted with latrines and wooden benches. The ship sailed back to India where, after disembarking from the ship, some of the passengers were killed in an incident with police authorities.
In 1924, the ship was renamed "Heian Maru". She was wrecked on Cape Soyedomari, Hokkaidō, Japan on 11 February 1926.

Aptera 2 Series

The Aptera 2 Series (formerly the Aptera Typ-1) was a high-efficiency passenger three-wheeled automobile under development by Aptera Motors. The California-based company opened a pre-ordering process for residents of California, but stopped taking deposits in July 2011, and on August 12, 2011, Aptera announced it would return all deposits from customers who had signed up to buy an Aptera 2e electric car or the planned 2h hybrid, before the company finally folded in December 2011.
The first variant of the 2 Series slated for production was the Aptera 2e (formerly Typ-1e), a battery electric vehicle. Aptera claimed the 2e would accelerate from in less than 10 seconds, and be capable of reaching a top speed of over . A later variant would have been Aptera 2h (formerly Typ-1h), a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. According to Aptera, the 2 Series would have been priced from the mid-s to mids, depending on the variant and options selected by the buyer.
An Aptera 2 made a short appearance in the 2009 film "Star Trek".
Design and fuel consumption.
The Aptera 2 Series was designed to be a low-energy vehicle; early estimates of its energy consumption ran as low as 80 watt-hours/mi at 55 mph. Later estimates are as high as 200Wh for aggressive driving. The company stated in September 2009 that "if Aptera was given an official EPA rating fuel-efficiency figure assigned to all cars by the US Gov, it would be 851 mpg", suggesting that it is 2.2 times more efficient than Nissan Leaf. The Aptera 2 Series has a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.15, compared with 0.19 for the record-holding EV1, and 0.24 for the 2010 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Coupé, currently the lowest for a mass-produced car. The Aptera's atypical shape is a result of extensive optimization in a virtual wind tunnel, following the designs of Alberto Morelli. It used recessed windshield wipers and low rolling resistance tires. -->
The first prototype attained a Cd of 0.11 by making use of an "Eyes-Forward" rear-view camera system instead of side-view mirrors, which create a large amount of drag. A September 2008 Aptera newsletter showed a rendering of the car featuring a conventional driver-side mirror and no driver-side rear-view camera. Aptera CTO Steve Fambro stated that the system was simplified to make use of a single camera mounted near the top of the vehicle.
The body design was similar to the human-powered 'Pegasus' and 'Fusion' vehicles and the MIT Aztec, but the direct inspiration was the Volkswagen 1-litre car.
The Aptera 2 Series was a three-wheeled vehicle with front-wheel drive. On March 23, 2010, Aptera announced their use of BorgWarner's 31-03 eGearDrive transmission for the 2e drive train. An April 14, 2010 press release announced further suppliers: A123Systems for the 20kWh lithium iron phosphate battery pack, and Remy International, Inc. for the 82 kW HVH250 electric motor.
The freeway range was promised to be around with two passengers and some luggage. They planned to offer a SAE J1772 compatible charging system, at either 110 or 220V.
Plug-in series hybrid.
An early Aptera 2h design used a "small, water-cooled EFI Gasoline engine with closed loop oxygen feedback and catalytic converter," coupled with a 12 kW generator/starter. With a tank capacity of "up to five gallons," the Aptera 2h would have a claimed range of , compared to the range of the Aptera 2e. The 2h would have been a series hybrid: the engine would not be connected to the drivetrain, instead being used to recharge the batteries.
As with any plug-in hybrid, fuel economy of the Aptera 2h depends on trip length and battery charge. For trips of less than about after a full charge the engine may not turn on at all, resulting in approximately the same energy consumption as the pure electric model: 96 watt-hours/mi. If on the other hand the car was never plugged in, the Aptera 2h would get . Aptera Motors quotes , which applies to a trip after a full charge. They justify this by stating that 99% of Americans drive less than daily.
Safety.
Because the Aptera 2 Series had only three wheels, most states in the US classify the vehicle as a motorcycle. This means that safety and emissions tests are not mandatory, as they are for automobiles.
Despite this, Aptera Motors emphasized that safety had a high priority in the vehicle's design. Aptera Motors performed simulated crash tests using ABAQUS FEA software, crush testing on structural components, and was planning real-world crash tests before production. The Aptera 2e featured a Formula One-inspired passenger safety cell and boxed sandwich foam core composite structures. Frontal crumple distance was , large for a vehicle of its size. As the body is above most cars' bumpers, a colliding vehicle's bumper would travel under the body, deflecting the energy. Despite its height, the placement of the heavy batteries lowered the center-of-mass of the Aptera 2 Series, a design similar to the highly stable Commuter Cars Tango. Driver and passenger airbag-in-seatbelts were also provided.
Accessories and interior.
The design intent model, revealed on April 14, 2010, seated two adults, had power windows, cup holders, and had of cargo capacity, enough for a couple of surfboards or a dozen bags of groceries. It used LED running and interior lights to reduce power consumption. An optional solar panel mounted on the roof runs the heat pump during the day. This keeps the interior comfortable and reduces the size of the heat pump needed. The seats can be heated or cooled by forced air, both for comfort and efficiency reasons. The only comfort downside is that the suspension was described as "hard".
Radio, CD/DVD/MP3 player, and GPS navigation were integrated into an in-console touch screen carputer, based on Moblin by Wind River Systems, but the climate control used physical dials. It also had RFID-based keyless ignition and entry and scarab doors.
To reduce the ecological footprint of construction, EcoSpun recycled materials --> and organic dyes were to be used for the seats and flooring, and the dashboard and the door panels were free of heavy metals and plasticizers. Aptera also planned to have leatherette and leather seats as options.

Star (graph theory)

In graph theory, a star "S"k is the complete bipartite graph "K"1,"k": a tree with one internal node and "k" leaves (but, no internal nodes and "k" + 1 leaves when "k" ≤ 1). Alternatively, some authors define "S"k to be the tree of order "k" with maximum diameter 2; in which case a star of "k" > 2 has "k" − 1 leaves.
A star with 3 edges is called a claw.
The star "S"k is edge-graceful when "k" is even and not when "k" is odd. It is an edge-transitive matchstick graph, and has diameter 2 (when "k" > 1), girth ∞ (it has no cycles), chromatic index "k", and chromatic number 2 (when "k" > 0). Additionally, the star has large automorphism group, namely, the symmetric group on k letters.
Stars may also be described as the only connected graphs in which at most one vertex has degree greater than one.
Relation to other graph families.
Claws are notable in the definition of claw-free graphs, graphs that do not have any claw as an induced subgraph. They are also one of the exceptional cases of the Whitney graph isomorphism theorem: in general, graphs with isomorphic line graphs are themselves isomorphic, with the exception of the claw and the triangle "K"3. 
A star is a special kind of tree. As with any tree, stars may be encoded by a Prüfer sequence; the Prüfer sequence for a star "K"1,"k" consists of "k" − 1 copies of the center vertex.
Several graph invariants are defined in terms of stars. Star arboricity is the minimum number of forests that a graph can be partitioned into such that each tree in each forest is a star, and the star chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color its vertices in such a way that every two color classes together form a subgraph in which all connected components are stars. The graphs of branchwidth 1 are exactly the graphs in which each connected component is a star.
Other applications.
The set of distances between the vertices of a claw provides an example of a finite metric space that cannot be embedded isometrically into a Euclidean space of any dimension.
The star network, a computer network modeled after the star graph, is important in distributed computing. 
A geometric realization of the star graph, formed by identifying the edges with intervals of some fixed length, is used as a local model of curves in tropical geometry. A tropical curve is defined to be a metric space that is locally isomorphic to a star shaped metric graph.

Kris Joseph

Kristopher Joseph (born December 17, 1988) is a Canadian professional basketball player for Élan Chalon of the French League. He played for the Syracuse Orange men's basketball team from 2008 to 2012. He was selected in the second round of the 2012 NBA Draft by the Boston Celtics with the 51st pick overall.
Early life.
Kris Joseph was born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, where he grew up in the working-class neighbourhood of Cote-des-Neiges north of downtown. Joseph first picked up a basketball in Grade 2 but was forced to shoot on garbage cans with his older brother Maurice due to a lack of courts in his low-income neighbourhood. A court was eventually erected in Cote-des-Neiges and the brothers battled for hours.
High school.
Joseph played in Maurice's shadow for a number of years as the older star gained prominence at noted Montreal-area prep school Champlain St. Lambert College. Kris struggled at first against elite competition, getting cut from his club team at the age of 14.
He worked on his game, grew to 6-foot-6 and became a star for Sun Youth, a club-team powerhouse in the Montreal Basketball League. As a tenth-grader, he led the Quebec provincial team to a silver medal at the 2005 Canada Games. He played for his High School team at Mont-Royal high school, the Mount-Royal Mustangs.
On a recommendation from youth coach Henry Wong, who thought Joseph needed an athletic and academic challenge, Joseph's mother agreed to let him leave Montreal in 2006 to complete two years of high school at Archbishop Carroll in Washington, D.C.
As a senior, Joseph led Archbishop Carroll to a 26–11 record, including a 21 point, five rebound, three assist and three block effort in the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference (WCAC) Tournament in a 65–55 win over Our Lady of Good Counsel. Joseph was also invited to play in the Baltimore All-Stars vs. U.S. All-Stars Exhibition in April. That season, Joseph would go on to earn 2008 second team honors from the Washington Post. He played AAU basketball with the DC Assault.
College career.
Joseph was ranked 114th overall and the 17th small forward in the class of 2008 by Rivals.com while garnering offers from Georgetown and University of Maryland before settling on Syracuse.
2008–09.
Joseph would see early playing time, including seven points in 22 minutes in an 85–51 rout of Le Moyne on November 16, 2008 and a 13-point six rebound effort in an 86–66 victory against Oakland University on November 22, 2008. On November 24, 2008, Joseph's 10 points and five rebounds helped then-unranked Syracuse upset then-No. 18 Florida, 89–83, in the semi-finals of the CBE Classic.
After an injury to Paul Harris, Joseph would receive the first start of his career against South Florida on January 2, 2009, scoring seven points and adding three rebounds.
2009–10.
Joseph would become a key reserve in his second year at Syracuse. In SU's Big East opener against Seton Hall on December 29, 2009, Joseph scored 16 points, including 8-of-9 shooting from the free throw line in an 80–73 win. On January 6, 2010 against Memphis, Joseph scored 15 second half points to go along with nine rebounds in a 74–57 win.
Joseph finished with averages of 11.0 points and 5.4 rebounds on the season, and was named the Big East Conference Sixth Man of the Year.
2010–11.
Joseph gained national prominence as a go-to scorer for the Orange during his junior year. He was named to the Wooden Award Preseason Top 50 list and improved his numbers across the board, leading Syracuse in scoring at 14.3 points per game and placing second in rebounding (5.2) and steals (1.5). He was named to the All-Big East third team, the first Canadian to receive the honour since fellow Montrealer Bill Wennington in 1985.
2011–12.
Joseph was once again named to the Wooden Award Preseason Top 50 list as a senior. His final season started off with a flourish as he was named the Big East Player of the Week after leading his Syracuse Orange to the NIT Season Tip Off Championship. Joseph was named Most Outstanding Player of the tournament with averages of 19.0 points, 9.5 rebounds and 3.5 steals in wins against Virginia Tech and Stanford.
He led the Orange in scoring during the regular season (13.4 ppg) and received an array of post-season awards, including a spot on the 2012 All-Big East First Team. Joseph is the first Canadian-born player ever to be named to the first team of that conference. He was named an AP Honorable Mention All-American and also earned spots on the USBWA All District II team as well as the NABC All-District 5 First Team. Additionally, Joseph was one of 15 post-season finalists for the Wooden Award, making him among the most decorated Canadians ever to play NCAA Division I basketball.
With his 15 points against Manhattan on Nov. 14, 2011, Joseph became the 55th player at Syracuse to score 1,000 points. He concluded his storied career with 10 points, two rebounds and 3 steals in Syracuse's 77–70 loss to Ohio State in the Elite Eight.

Cupcakes Taste Like Violence

Cupcakes Taste Like Violence is the second extended play by American singer-songwriter, Jeffree Star. It was released on December 9, 2008, and was the first record to be released under Popsicle Records through Warner Music's Independent Label Group. The first single "Lollipop Luxury", was released on November 18, 2008.
Background.
After announcing in 2007 that recording was underway for his first studio album, "Beauty Killer", Star embarked on his first headlining tour. While on tour, he performed songs written for inclusion on the record, including "Cupcakes Taste like Violence" and a cover of Rockwell's "Somebody's Watching Me". Star stated in interviews that the latter track featured Trace Cyrus and Mason Musso from Metro Station. However, due to a feud between the band and Star, they were ultimately replaced with Andrew de Torres from Danger Radio. 
During the tour, Star announced the names of several songs which would be included on "Beauty Killer", including "Picture Perfect!" and "So Fierce". However, these songs did not make the final cut but a remixed version of "Lollipop Luxury" featuring Nicki Minaj is featured on the album. The following summer, Star debuted "So Fierce" on the Vans Warped Tour. 
The EP was announced with the title "Cupcakes Taste like Violence". Of the title, Star said "I named my EP "Cupcakes Taste like Violence" because it reminded me of myself. I may look sweet, but I'm really scary and violent on the inside."
Release and promotion.
With "Beauty Killer" scheduled for release in late 2008, his cover of "Somebody's Watching Me" was chosen as the album's first single. A hot pink vinyl disc was set for release in October exclusively at Hot Topic locations. However, the album's release date was pushed back to summer 2009. Star then began promoting the release of an EP on his MySpace profile, with "Starstruck", a retitling of his recording of "Somebody's Watching Me", as the EP's first single. 
To promote the EP, Star announced that "Starstruck" would be released as a free download on MySpace on October 3, 2008. However, the song was made available as early as September 28 on his Pure Volume profile.
The song "Cupcakes Taste Like Violence" was featured on the popular MTV TV show "Paris Hilton: My New BFF".
Artwork design.
The album cover and booklet photos were taken by Kat Von D with some booklet photos being taken by photographer and film maker, Austin Young.
Controversy.
Following the album's release, a video began circulating that claims to show similarities between portions of "Cupcakes Taste like Violence" and "Moving in Stereo" by The Cars, to which Jeffree replied saying "And what?".

Glade Creek is a major tributary of the New River in Raleigh County, West Virginia. Glade Creek lies within the largest side valley off New River in the New River Gorge National River area.
Source.
Glade Creek is formed on Flat Top Mountain just north of the point where Raleigh, Summers and Mercer counties intersect. Just north of its source near Ghent, it is impounded to form Flat Top Lake. Further north, it is again impounded to form Glade Creek Reservoir.
Canyon.
Immediately north of Glade Creek Reservoir, Glade Creek begins its canyon section. The canyon varies from about in depth at its upstream end to over deep near its mouth at the New River southeast of Prince.
Much of the lower canyon is traversed by an abandoned railroad bed. Today, this former railbed is now maintained as a hiking trail by New River Gorge National River.
Phil G. McDonald Memorial Bridge.
"Location: "
Approximately upstream of its mouth, Glade Creek is crossed by Interstate 64 on the Phil G. McDonald Memorial Bridge, also known as the Glade Creek Bridge. This long deck truss bridge towers above the creek bed, making it the highest Interstate bridge in the United States.

Southern States Wrestling

Southern States Wrestling is an American independent professional wrestling promotion based in eastern Tennessee. Founded by wrestler Beau James in early 1991, SSW (along with NWA Bluegrass) succeeded Smoky Mountain Wrestling as the top promotion in eastern Tennessee following its close. It featured a number of former SMW mainstays including Stane Lee NOT Stan Lane, Steve Flynn, Tracy Smothers, Killer Kyle, Tom Prichard, Bunkhouse Buck, Buddy Landell, The Mongolian Stomper and The Batten Twins (Bart & Brad Batten). While in the promotion, Ricky Morton teamed with longtime "Fantastics" rival Bobby Fulton as the Fantastic Express as well as forming a second incarnation of the Rock 'n' Roll Express with Ricky Harrison capturing the promotion's tag team titles with both men.
Others to appear in the promotion have included former National Wrestling Alliance veterans Ivan Koloff, Jimmy Valiant, Junkyard Dog, Pez Whatley, Terry Taylor, Shane Douglas and female wrestlers Sherri Martel, Debbie Combs, Brandi Alexander, Lexie Fyfe and Malia Hosaka. Jillian Hall, EZ Money, Andy Douglas and Edge and Christian (Edge & Christian) spent their early careers there as well. The promotion also runs a wrestling school in Fall Branch, Tennessee.
History.
Southern States Wrestling was founded by Beau James, who began promoting wrestling events in Kingsport and Fall Branch, Tennessee. The promotion crowned its first heavyweight champion when The Tennessee Equalizer defeated George Hiatt in Elizabethton, Tennessee on February 16, 1991. A junior heavyweight title was created the following year when Eddie Golden defeated Jamie Gibson in Banner Elk, North Carolina. In 1995 the promotion expanded by creating two more titles. The junior heavyweight title was abandoned the previous year and replaced by the SSW Appalachin Championship won by Eddie Golden when he beat Tracy Smothers in a best-of-three series in Meadowview, Virginia on May 11, 1996. Four years later, Mike Cooper won the SSW Young Guns Television Championship in Kingsport coinciding with the promotion launching its weekly television program which aired regularly on WAPK-CA from January 1999 until October 2003. According to the promotion, the show became the highest rated program in the Kingsport-area. The promotion eventually released a series of dvds from the program, most notably, "Superstars and Legends, Vol. 1", which featured Don Wright, Ivan Koloff, The Equalizer, Jimmy Valiant, Wahoo McDaniel, Killer Kyle, Jimmy Valiant and Stan Lee. On May 10, 2001, the promotion held the "Mark Curtis Memorial Weekend of Champions" in Kingsport, Tennessee in honor of World Championship Wrestling referee Mark Curtis with the proceeds donated to the Children's Miracle Network. Among those headlining the event included Arn Anderson. The next year, the "Mark Curtis Memorial Weekend of Champions and Legends Reunion" featured Jimmy Valiant, Ivan Koloff and Sandy Scott. Family members of the late Whitey Caldwell were also in attendance. Southern States Wrestling became involved with AWA Superstars of Wrestling during the early-2000s, although not an official affiliate promotion, and has held interpromotional events with its sister promotion Tennessee's Championship Wrestling. In April 2005, Beau James, Tom Prichard and The Super Destroyer faced Championship Wrestling's "Adorable" Danny Ray, Nick Hammonds & Wayne Adkins at the "Night of Grudges" supercard at the National Guard Armory in Kingsport. This was the first interpromotional event in which both promotion's champions faced each other. In November 2006, Beau James married female wrestler Misty James at the 15th annual supercard "Thanksgiving Night Spectacular" at the Kingsport National Guard Armory. Both would participate in mixed tag team matches during the next year. In early 2008, he and his wife were involved in a major interpromotional feud with AWA Superstars of Wrestling World Heavyweight Champion Brian Logan.

Plot.
A group of agents of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (a forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency) is sent to German-occupied Italy during World War II to knock out the German-held Italian railroad system. In accomplishing this mission, most of them are killed because of an inside betrayal.
After the war, one of the survivors, Captain Webster Carey (Alan Ladd), resolves to find the traitor. Captain Carey returns to Orta, near Milan, to find out who betrayed his World War II O.S.S. team and caused the deaths of several villagers. Much to his surprise, his old love Giulia (Wanda Hendrix), whom he thought dead at the hands of the Nazis, is alive and married to a powerful Italian nobleman, Barone Rocco de Graffi (Francis Lederer). The villagers are unfriendly, but Carey persists in his clandestine efforts to flush out the traitor.

Heartland Food Corporation

Heartland Foods is one of the largest franchises of Burger King. The Downers Grove, Illinois-based company owns and operates over 225 restaurants in six US States.
History.
By 2001 and nearly eighteen years of stagnant growth, many of Burger King's franchises were in some sort of financial distress. The lack of growth severely impacted BKC's largest franchise, the nearly 400 store AmeriKing; by 2001 the company, which until this point had been struggling under a nearly $300 million debt load and been shedding store across the US, was forced to enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
While several individual BK franchisees also took advantage of the AmeriKing failure and the resulting sale of its assets, Miami-based franchisee Al Cabrera purchased the largest chunk of stores, 130 locations primarily in the Chicago and the upper mid-west, from the failed company for a bargain basement price of $16 million, or approximately 88% of their original value. Taking these stores, he and his partners created a new company called Core Value Partners to renovate and update the locations which had deteriorated during Ameriking's decline. During this time, the company was renamed Heartland Foods and it purchased 120 additional stores from other financially distressed owners and completely revamped them as well. The resulting purchases made Mr. Cabrerra Burger King's largest minority franchisee and Heartland one of BKC's top franchisee groups. By 2006, the company was valued at over $150 million, and was sold to New York-based GSO Capital Partners.

Richard William George Hingston, son of the Rev. R. E. H. Hingston, Felhampton,Merton, was born in 1887. Most of his early life was spent in the family home at Horsehead in Passage West County Cork.
He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and at University College Cork. He graduated from the National University of Ireland with first-class honours in 1910, and almost immediately obtained a position in the Indian Medical Service. He secured second place in the I.M.S. examination, among the eminent group which included T. A. Hughes, the physiologist,Clive Newcomb, the research chemist,and Henry Shortt, the parasitologist.
In 1913 he was seconded from military duty as naturalist to the Indo-Russian Pamir triangulation expedition. In 1914 he went on war service and saw action in East Africa,France, Mesopotamia, and the N.W. Frontier,gaining two mentions in dispatches and the Military Cross for gallantry in action.

In "A naturalist in the Himalaya" (1920),he told of the spiders, ants, and butterflies of the high valleys;
"A naturalist in Hindustan" (1923) detailed the lesser fauna of the plains of the United Provinces.

Tapora

Tapora is a locality on the Okahukura Peninsula, which is on the eastern side of the Kaipara Harbour in New Zealand. It is part of the Rodney District. Wellsford lies to the east. 
Early history.
Early history of Maori tells how the western shores of Okahukura once extended to the entrance of the Kaipara Harbour as sand dunes with two channels into the harbour instead of one, as it is now. This portion of land that was more or less sand dunes was known as Tapora, and was inhabited by the Maori. Great storms gradually caused the sand dunes to drift away, allowing the sea to encroach, leaving only sand bars in the harbour where there was once a whare or large temple on the original sand dunes.
For ten generations the land of Okahukura remained in the possession of Ngati Whatua. For more than ten years after the Government had purchased the neighbouring land known as Albertland, the peninsula was occupied by the Ngati Whatua tribe.
About the year 1876 T. E. FitzGerald purchased the land from Ngati Whatua which included the Okahukura point and of land. FitzGerald built his first homestead around 1880 on a ridge overlooking Oruawharo River. Here he built a jetty for small boats for access when there was sufficient high tide, but there was a main landing point in deeper water for any tide. Due to the large number of kauri trees, FitzGerald leased the rights of this land to gum-diggers. Due to old age FitzGerald had to retire and terminate his twenty years of occupancy at Okahukura.
Following FitzGerald's retirement A. H. Walker leased this land for two and a half years and dramatically improved the landscape by re-fencing and sowing grass. T.C. Williams now leased the land with W. Williams taking over management. For the next ten years Williams and his workers spent many days cutting and burning down bush to allow for sowing grasslands, while opening gumfields and a store at one of FitzGerald's old homes. In the year 1910 Williams was in the process of transferring the management of the block to C. Kemp, when he accidentally fatally shot himself. Kemp took over management of Okahukura, continuing with the development of boundary fences. Nearer the end of 1910 Okahukura was sold to Messrs Bowron and Smith of Christchurch. Kemp was still manager of the Okahukura property and split the property up, selling sections to others and developed roads for access into the new sections as well as communications through a telephone line. The land changed ownership numerous times between World War One and World War Two. 
Recent history.
During World War Two the United States Marines set up camp on 'the run' (Sea View) and used the greater area for target practice. The New Zealand Government then took over Okahukura to use as a soldier rehabilitation settlement in April 1945. The name Okahukura was then changed to Tapora to avoid confusion with another Okahukura elsewhere in New Zealand. 
The Minister of 'Land and Returned Services' Association brokered a pact to develop the Okahukura peninsula for returned servicemen through ballots. A community to be called Tapora was planned with a shop, school, church and workers' houses (only the school and a few houses were constructed). The ballots for the Returned Services' Association were created in 1947 and Tapora turned into a dairy farming settlement. 
Tapora is now a thriving community with productive dairy farms, a primary school, community hall and golf course. 
Education.
Tapora School is a coeducational full primary (years 1-8) school with a decile rating of 6 and a roll of 36.

Rally of the Rideau Lakes was a rally competition held in Smiths Falls, Ontario, Canada. The rally originated from the Silver Lake Rally, a club rally started in the 1960s. Rally of the Rideau Lakes was first held in 1973, and it became part of the FIA World Rally Championship schedule for the 1974 season. The event was considered well-run and it influenced the Canadian Rally Championship, but due to financial problems it was never held again. However, the World Rally Championship returned to Canada in the 1977 season, when the Critérium du Quebec was included in the calendar.
The 1974 Rally of the Rideau Lakes was run from October 16-20, two weeks before the other North American WRC round, the Press-on-Regardless Rally in the United States. The rally consisted of 40 special stages on gravel roads. Of the 51 starting crews, 19 finished the event.

Exile of Atlantis

"Exile of Atlantis" is a short story by Robert E. Howard and is the first story written by Howard to feature his creation Kull, set in his fictional Thurian Age.
It details the events that lead Kull to be exiled by his tribe, as well as foreshadows Kull's future as a great king through the use of a prophetic dream. This story would not be published until 1967, in the Lancer book, "King Kull".
Plot.
Long before it became a great empire, the continent of Atlantis was populated by a various tribes of barbarians. Three barbarians of the Sea-mountain tribe — Kull, Am-ra and Gor-na — camp for the night. Gor-na, the oldest, tells an ancient story of a tiger who prayed to the moon to for deliverance from pursuing hunters and was granted sanctuary, causing all tigers to worship the moon. Kull finds fault with this story, pointing out that tigers wouldn't worship the moon for aiding some tiger who lived centuries ago. Gor-na rebukes Kull for his ridicule of old myths and traditions, insisting that what has always been will always be. Kull believes this to be false, saying that not even mountains last forever. Gor-na reminds Kull that he was rescued by the Sea-mountain tribe from a feral existence after his people died in a great flood, and that Kull must learn to accept the ways of his adopted people. Am-ra, the youngest of the group, comes to Kull's defense, saying that while Kull may be an outsider, he is clearly the strongest member of their tribe. Gor-na has to agree.
The conversation turns to the outside world. The neighboring islands of Lemuria are currently at war against the great kingdom of Valusia of the mainland. Kull gets excited, and says that he wishes to someday see Valusia, the City of Wonder. Gor-na says that if he ever does, it will be in chains.
As the men lay down to sleep, Kull has a strange dream. In it, he hears the sound of war and trumpets. He sees glorious vistas opening up before him. He sees himself wearing a golden crown, and hears people shouting "King Kull! King Kull!" Kull awakens to find himself haunted and enthralled by the vision.
The next morning, the men return to their village. They see that a young girl named Ala is about to be burned at the stake. Ala dared to marry a Lemurian pirate, and was exiled for breaking the age-old feud. When the lovers' ship crashed and she washed ashore, her people found her, and now intend to execute her. Kull finds himself bewildered and disgusted by the laws that insist a person must be put to death for marrying an enemy of their race. His eyes meet Ala's and they reach a silent understanding. Kull takes out his hunting knife and throws it at the girl's chest, killing her in an instant and sparing her the torture of being burned to death.
While the villagers are still too shocked to act, Kull turns and flees. Am-ra saves Kull's life by causing an archer to miss his shot. Kull climbs up the side of the cliff, and escapes by jumping into the sea.
Trivia.
Marvel used this story as a part of their adaption of "A King Comes Riding".

John Vaughan's Gibson Firebird employs a gutsy fuzz tone, and Jack Bond's Hammond B-3 and Leslie hold the composition together. Syncopation with the other instruments is achieved by Ted Smith's precision drumming. After a fade out and a four second pause when the song appears to be over, the music comes back in full force for another 30 seconds.
Reception.
"Asphalt Mother" continues to survive on its own more than four decades after it was recorded, despite never having been promoted. It is played on FM radio, and appears on 60s compilation CDs, pirated discs, internet radio, and BitTorrents.

Jacques de Cysoing

Jacques de Cysoing was a late thirteenth-century Franco-Flemish trouvère. He wrote nine songs that survive, all of them with their melodies. 
Probably born into a noble Flemish family in Cysoing, "messire" Jacques probably flourished during the reign of Guy of Dampierre as Count of Flanders (1251–1305), for he addresses his "serventois" "Li nouviaus tans" to the count. Other events that date Jacques are a reference to the Battle of Mansurah in 1250 in one of his songs and a reference in an "envoi" of Thomas Herier to "Jakemon" at "Cyson", probably in the third quarter of the century. 
All of Jacques's musical compositions are in ABABx form and are preserved in only a few manuscripts, but one, "Nouvele amour", exists in eight different versions, including two "contrafacta". The popularity of this one piece is probably explained by its rondeau form, though the original text is not a rondeau. Jacques's song "Quant la saisons" is a "chanson avec des refrains" in which each of the eight stanzas has a different refrain and some of these refrains are found in other songs.

Horseshoe theory

The horseshoe theory in political science asserts that rather than the far left and the far right being at opposite and opposing ends of a linear political continuum, they in fact closely resemble one another, much like the ends of a horseshoe. The theory is attributed to French writer Jean-Pierre Faye.
Horseshoe theory competes with the conventional linear left-right continuum system as well as the various multidimensional systems. Proponents of the theory point to similarities between the extreme left and the extreme right. Specifically, the two ends share an authoritarian element. In extreme left political systems (such as communism) the government takes control of the economic resources. In extreme right political systems (such as fascism) the government also takes control of the economic life, creating a central planning. With both extremes, this theory asserts, the power elite are opposed to genuine clean elections, genuinely free media and speech, and similar democratic institutions that characterise the political center.
Origin of the term.
The earliest use of the term in political theory appears to be from Jean-Pierre Faye's book "Le Siècle des idéologies". Others have attributed the theory as having come from Lipset, Bell and an entire ‘pluralist school’.
Modern uses.
More recently, the term has been used when comparing hostility towards Jews from both the far left and the far right (see New antisemitism).
Criticism.
Critics of the theory have suggested that many sociologists consider the Horseshoe theory to have been discredited.
In University of Reading academic Peter Barker's book, "GDR and Its History", Peter Thompson of the University of Sheffield observes that the theory is "increasingly orthodox", and describes the theory as seeing "left and right-wing parties being closer to each other than the centre".

TV Face

TV Face is a pulpy, horror webseries directed by Dean Bull and produced by David Britz. 99 Potions and Paradox Opera are the production companies associated with creating the show. It started its broadcast July 23, 2007 of its first episode of the 34-part series. However, before this release, several videos were released that claimed to be underground and banned videos from the 1980s. This left fans wondering if these were indeed legitimate archived videos, or videos concocted by the creators themselves.
TV Face has a rich canon of influences that brings the show its unique flavor. Harkening back to the "Video Nasties" blacklisted by The Video Recordings Act 1984 in the UK, the quirky and driven characters of TV Face search for these lost trashy gems. The characters treat this media with a strange level of reverence and sanctity. The script went through intense dramaturgy to embrace elements of Shakespearean and classical technique, the Suzuki Method style of abstract characterization (developed by Tadashi Suzuki); all while combining classical western play structure with eastern media sensibilities. The show itself favors bold artistic decisions.
Plot.
Mitch (Scott Vickaryous), an obsessive collector and aspiring comic book artist ravenously snaps up rare horror VHS's to sell for big bucks in order to jump-start his career. The unlikely anti-hero undergoes physical "hero" training ordered by his Publisher to improve his drawings. Meanwhile, his female counterpart, Jessica (Lindsey Girardot), tries desperately to escape the Nightmare Circuit, a dreamlike other-world, while struggling to remember her past. Obsessed with winning Mitch back as a friend and controlling his life, Randy (Jilon Ghai) stops at nothing to get the upper hand on Mitch.
When Mitch discovers "IL Bruto," the rarest horror film in the world, his training is put to the test as a supernatural rival, TV Face, appears; hell-bent on claiming the prize for himself. Aided by Jessica and sabotaged by Randy, Mitch struggles to get Il Bruto back from the dangerous Delilah, and trap TV Face inside Applegrove High's treacherous waterworks. With his life in the balance, Mitch attempts to unravel the mystery surrounding "IL Bruto," before facing losing everything he holds dear.

Beaches in Port Phillip

Port Phillip is a bay in western Victoria. It has many beaches, most of which are mountainous, shallow and long, with very small breaks making swimming quite safe. This attracts many tourists, mostly families, to the beaches of Port Phillip during the summer months and school holidays. Water sports such as body boarding and surfing are easy or simple, except in extreme weather conditions. Most sandy beaches are located on the bay's northern, eastern and southern shorelines, while the western shorelines host a few sandy beaches, there mostly exists a greater variety of beaches, swampy wetlands and mangroves. The occasional pebble beach and easy sand dunes can also be found, mostly in the southern reaches.

Buffalo Metropolitan Transportation Center

The Buffalo Metropolitan Transportation Center is located on the southeast corner of North Division and Ellicott Streets in Downtown Buffalo, New York. The transportation center is open 24 hours daily.
Managed by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, which also uses the transit center as its headquarters, it operates as a major transportation hub for a number of NFTA Metro bus routes, as well as inter-city bus services. Its location is also of importance in that this terminal normally is the first or last stop in the United States on the busy Toronto-New York City bus corridor in the United States (the exceptions being a re-routed Buffalo to Toronto runs serving Buffalo Niagara International Airport on the way to the Rainbow Bridge, where it crosses into Ontario). The closest two Canadian bus stations (though not served by all trips) are Fort Erie (located at a Robomart gas station at 22 Princess Street, at Waterloo Street) or the more frequently served Niagara Falls Coach Terminal at Bridge and Erie Streets in downtown Niagara Falls, Ontario.
Built in 1977, the architectural firm of Cannon Design, Inc. created a terminal that is a "pleasant and even exciting space to experience, with views of travelers, buses and the city beyond afforded by comparatively large areas of glazing". It replaced an older Greyhound Station, located at 672 Main Street, near Tupper. After the Main Street station had closed, it became a police station for the Buffalo Theater District, and is currently used partially as the Alleyway Theatre
Inside the Terminal.
Aside from the transportation center being the main offices for the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority and the Buffalo area base office for Greyhound Lines, Inc., there are a number of service based businesses for passengers and employees of the terminal.
In the past, Hardee's and Burger King had an outlet in the terminal that was later turned into a "Travelers Cafe", both operated by Greyhound Lines. The space for the restaurant has since been converted into an indoor waiting area for passengers waiting for local bus service at the corner of North Division and Ellicott. Announcements are not made of arriving local service in the waiting area, so passengers watch for arriving buses through floor-to-ceiling picture windows along that wall.
Additionally, a gift shop existed for a number of years, but has been vacated and renovated into a larger office area for the NFTA Transit Police sub-station.

Nearly all buses operating into Downtown Buffalo come within a short walk (maximum of three city blocks) of the transportation center.
Additionally.
In the later part of 1999, proposals were made for an updating of the terminal, including a new shopping area, restaurant, and updated passenger waiting area for NFTA Metro passengers, as well as intercity bus passengers.
The Buffalo News continued stories on this, as well as progress made on the creation of an intermodal transportation facility on the site of the Buffalo War Memorial Auditorium, effectively linking Amtrak Trains with intercity buses, and local buses "under one roof" in a style similar to the William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center partway across the state in Syracuse, New York.

A federal parliamentary republic refers to a federation of states with a republican form of government that is, more or less, dependent upon the confidence of parliaments at both the national and subnational levels. It is a combination of the federal republic and the parliamentary republic.
Such republics usually possess a bicameral legislature at the federal level out of necessity, so as to allow for a set, often equal number of representatives of the subnational entities to sit in the upper house; however, the government, headed by a head of government, will be dependent upon the lower house of parliament for its stability or legitimacy.

<doc id="19310838" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19310838" title="Brown–Vialetto–Van Laere syndrome">
Brown–Vialetto–Van Laere syndrome

Brown-Vialetto-Van-Laere syndrome (BVVL), sometimes better known as Brown's Syndrome, is a rare degenerative disorder that is characterized by progressive sensorineural deafness (Voudris 2002). BVVL is marked by a number of cranial nerve palsies including those of the motor components involving the 7th and 9th-12th cranial nerves, spinal motor nerves, and upper motor neurons (Voudris 2002). The neurological manifestations develop insidiously: they usually begin with sensorineural deafness, progress inexorably to paralysis, and often culminate in respiratory failure. The syndrome affects children, adolescents, and younger adults; the age at onset of symptoms in the reported cases has ranged from infancy to the third decade of life. The prognosis is poor—most patients diagnosed with the syndrome die within 10 years. There is no cure.
History.
The syndrome was first described by Charles Brown in 1894; further accounts by Vialetto and Van Laere followed in 1936 and 1966, respectively. There are fewer than 60 cases reported in the medical literature over the 100 odd years since its first description.
Epidemiology.
Worldwide, there are thirty-eight known cases of Brown-Vialetto-Van-Laere syndrome (Voudris 2002). BVVL was first described in a Portuguese family, and has since been described in a number of ethnic groups. Reports have shown that BVVL infects females more than males at a rate of 5:1 respectively. However, males usually exhibit more severe symptoms, an earlier onset of deafness and a tendency to die earlier in life (Voudris 2002).
Etiology.
The etiology of BVVL is unknown (Prahbu 2005). Since about half of the 38 BVVL patients have no recognized symptoms in parents or relatives, it is thought that BVVL might be of autosomal recessive inheritance (Prahbu 2005). However, several cases of BVVL have suggested that the syndrome may be autosomal dominant or X linked (Sathasivam 2000).
Megarbane et al. reported for the first time a consanguineous Lebanese family (Nair 2006). This family demonstrates the autosomal recessive inheritance of the disorder. The family had three affected children that all presented the same severe symptoms, however, the parents and other siblings had no signs of the disease. The first case involved an eight-year-old boy, whose hearing and walking impairment started at two years of age. Upon examining the boy, it was found that he was weak, completely deaf, and hypotonic. Neurological examination showed low muscle tone; dorsal scoliosis; tongue contractions; a small number of spontaneous movements; neck, shoulder and upper arm muscular weakness; clawed hands; absent deep tendon reflexes; and no Babinski response. Upon radiological examination, the patient showed left curved scoliosis and thin diaphyses of the long bones. The patient died at five, most likely due to respiratory failure. The patient’s younger brother suffered from the same disease, and demonstrated limited speech and vocalization by the age of seven. He also showed similar neurological symptoms as his brother, and died four months after the onset of symptoms. The third case in the immediate family was the two patients’ sister who died at the age of four with symptoms similar to her brothers. Finally, the patients had a cousin whose neurological features were identical to his cousins. All of these patients had symptoms indicative of BVVL. It is thought that identification of the gene responsible for the family’s disorder would be a major step in knowing the etiology of this disease (Nair 2006).
The gene defective in at least some patients with BVVL has been identified by a team of British researchers: "C20orf54". This gene is thought to be involved in transport of riboflavin 
It has been proposed that Fazio–Londe disease and Brown-Vialetto–Van–Laere syndrome are a phenotypically associated condition.
Symptoms.
Major features of BVVL include facial and neck weakness, fasciculation of the tongue, and neurological disorders from the cranial nerves (Prahbu 2005). Most mortality in patients has been from either respiratory infections or respiratory muscle paralysis. Pathological descriptions of BVVL include injury and depletion of 3rd-7th cranial nerves, loss of the spinal anterior horn cells, degeneration of Purkinje cells, as well as degeneration of the spinocerebellar and pyramidal tracts (Prahbu 2005). The first symptoms in nearly all cases of BVVL is progressive deafness, and the first initial symptoms are seen anywhere from one to three years (Sathasivam 2000). Most cases of deafness are followed by a latent period that can extend anywhere from weeks to years, and this time is usually marked by cranial nerve degeneration. Neurological symptoms of BVVL include optic atrophy, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, epilepsy, mental retardation, and autonomic dysfunction (Sathasivam 2000). Non- neurological symptoms can include diabetes, auditory hallucinations, respiratory difficulties, color blindness, and hypertension.
Diagnosis.
To date, there is no test of confirmation for BVVL, although as of 2008, BVVL researchers are searching to isolate the responsible gene(s) for both BVVL and Fazio-Londe syndromes, as it has been proposed that Fazio-Londe disease and Brown-Vialetto-Van-Laere syndrome are a phenotypically associated condition.
Differential diagnosis of BVVL includes Boltshauser syndrome, Madras disease, progressive bulbar paralysis of Fazio Londe, Nathalie syndrome and ALS (Nair 2006)
Treatment.
Patients with BVVL need symptomatic treatment and supportive care. This could include gastrostomy feeding and assisted ventilation, while steroids may or may not help patients (Sathasivam 2000).
The first report of BVVL syndrome in Japanese literature was of a woman that had BVVL and showed improvement after such treatments. The patient was a sixty-year-old woman that had symptoms such as sensorineural deafness, weakness, and atrophy since she was 15 years old. Around the age of 49 the patient was officially diagnosed with BVVL, intubated, and then attached to a respirator to improve her CO2 narcosis. After the treatments, the patient still required respiratory assistance during sleep; however, the patient no longer needed assistance by a respirator during the daytime (Hiroshi 2005).
A Dutch group have reported the first promising attempt at treatment of the disorder with high doses of riboflavin. See here for further information
Prognosis.
The clinical course of BVVL can vary from one patient to another. There have been cases with progressive deterioration, deterioration followed by periods of stabilization, and deterioration with abrupt periods of increasing severity (Prahbu 2005). 
BVVL syndrome is often found in late childhood and adolescents, however, seven cases have been found with symptoms starting within the first five years (Voudris 2002). 
The youngest case of BVVL was documented by Voudris (Voudris 2002). The patient was a male infant who had a normal birth and neonatal period, healthy parents and no family history of neurological disorders. This male was the youngest patient in literature who featured severe symptoms of BVVL syndrome. At twelve months, the patient developed an upper respiratory infection and demonstrated both stridor and harshness of voice. Three weeks later, the child showed apnea, suspension of external breathing, and was artificially ventilated for three days. However, aside from slight bilateral facial weakness the patient showed a relatively normal neurological examination with normal motor and sensory nerve conduction. At fourteen months, the child developed dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, and was then fed with a catheter. Between fifteen and eighteen months, the patient showed progressive neurological degeneration with symptoms such as paralysis of extraocular muscles responsible for eye movements, bilateral facial palsy, weakness of jaw muscles and tongue, and sever weakness of upper extremities with disappearance of tendon reflexes. Between eighteen and twenty-one months, the child became lethargic and unresponsive, lost interchange between sleep and awakening, and no longer reacted to any visual or auditory stimulation. The patient died at twenty-one months of respiratory failure. This particular case of BVVL syndrome differs from others in that the patient had severe symptoms at an unusually early age. While no autopsy on the child was performed, researchers are hoping that the unusual symptoms in this case and other similar cases can be used to provide a link between BVVL syndrome and Fazio-Londe disease (Voudris 2002). 
The syndrome can be fatal or protracted for a longer period. There are three documented cases of BVVL where the patient died within the first five years of the disease. On the contrary, at least fourteen patients have survived more than 10 years after the onset of their first symptom, and several cases have survived 20–30 years after the onset of their first symptom (Sathasivam 2000).
Families with multiple cases of BVVL and more generally, multiple cases of Infantile Progressive Bulbar Palsy, can show variability in age of disease onset and survival. Dipti and Childs described such a situation in which a family had five children that had Infantile PBP. In this family, three siblings showed sensorineural deafness and other symptoms of BVVL at an older age. The other two siblings showed symptoms of Fazio-Londe disease and died before the age of two (Dipti 2005).

Robert Browne (Jacobean actor)

Robert Browne (1563 – c. 1622) was an English actor and theatre manager and investor of the later sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. He was also part of a long-standing confusion in the scholarship of English Renaissance theatre. 
Two Robert Brownes.
The historical records of English Renaissance drama contain repeated mentions of "Robert Browne." Early scholars like E. K. Chambers and Edwin Nunzeger interpreted the records to indicate a single individual. Later scholars, principally Charles Jasper Sisson and Herbert Berry, demonstrated that two different men of the same name had been confused and conflated together.
The "other" Robert Browne died in 1603, and so can accurately be termed an Elizabethan actor. The Robert Browne who is the subject of this article had a career that extended through the first two decades of the seventeenth century, and in that sense can, as a differentiation, be called a Jacobean actor.
At home and abroad.
Born in 1563, Robert Browne's acting career began by the time he was twenty years old, when he was a member of Worcester's Men (1583). He was one of the English actors who performed on the Continent, especially in Germany, where English actors were especially favored. (Some names are known: Thomas Sackville, a clown; John Broadstreet, a "springer", accompanied by Richard Jones, a musician). Browne worked in Holland in 1590, and for Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg in Wolfenbüttel, in Frankfurt and Nuremberg in the 1592–94 period. He was in Germany again from 1601 through 1607, and once more in 1618–20. This does not mean Browne was consistently abroad during those years; rather he passed back and forth between England and the Continent. 
Browne was in Frankfurt in September 1602, and in Augsburg later that year; he was in Nuremberg in February 1603. He was in Frankfurt again in 1606; he and other English actors were under the patronage of Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, who had built for the 'Englische Komoedianten', in Kassel 1605, a roofed theatre, the oldest extant such building in Germany, although nowadays used as a wildlife museum; in 1606 and 1607. In 1618 he was with English players in Nuremberg in May, in Strassburg in June and July, and in Frankfurt in the autumn. He spent the winter of 1619–20 in Prague, at the court of Frederick and Elizabeth, King and Queen of Bohemia. He was back in Germany in early 1620.
Theatre business.
When William Sly, long a member of the King's Men, died in 1608, he left Robert Browne his share in the Globe Theatre. Browne did not keep the share for long; rather he sold it to Henry Condell and John Heminges in partnership. Browne had a more substantive involvement in theatre investment and management in 1610, when he became one of the patentees of the Children of the Queen's Revels at the Whitefriars Theatre. Browne may have had a specific responsibility for training the young actors in the troupe.
Family.
Browne married Cicely (or Sisely) Sands (or Saunders), the sister of actor James Sands, in 1594. Their son Robert was christened on 19 October 1595, their daughter Jane on 2 December 1599. The family resided in Clerkenwell, in the neighborhood of the Red Bull Theatre where many actors and theatre people of the time lived.
After Browne's death, his widow would marry actor William Robbins.

Jordan of Pisa

Blessed Jordan of Pisa (or Giordano da Pisa) ("c." 1255 – 19 August 1311) was a Dominican theologian and preacher, the first whose vernacular Italian sermons are preserved. His "cultus" was confirmed on 23 August 1833 by Pope Gregory XVI and he was beatified in 1838; his day is either March 6 or August 19. His relics are in the church of Santa Catalina in Pisa.
Jordan was born in the mid thirteenth century at Pisa. He was educated at the University of Bologna and then Paris in the late 1270s, where he received his bachelor's of theology. He went on to join the Dominican house there in 1280. At Pisa he founded the Confraternity of the Holy Redeemer, whose constitution survives, and several others, whose do not. He preached and taught variously at Siena, Viterbo, and Perugia before eventually moving to Florence, in which area he was a widely respected preacher, eventually being appointed by the provincial chapter at Rieti as a lector in the church of Santa Maria Novella in 1305. He held that post for the next three years, and contributed greatly to its esteem. In 1311 the Master General Aymericus Giliani appointed him professor of theology at the friary of Saint James in Paris, to deliver his reading of the Lombard's "Sentences" and obtain his master's degree, but he died at Piacenza on the journey.
Jordan studied the use of preaching for evangelisation. He pioneered the use of the Tuscan language for preaching and lecturing, which helped establish it as the foremost among the vernaculars of Italy. His Tuscan was reputedly versatile and musical, but never elaborate or ornate. At Florence he would reportedly preached five times a day, walking about, both indoors and out, followed by a crowd of listeners as he developed his topic. During his lengthy sermons his friend and disciple, Silvester of Valdiseve, sometimes sat near the pulpit with wine to refrech him. Some of his listeners took notes that have survived. His preaching was said to have a positive effect on Florentine public life and morality by its emphasis on sound (i.e. Thomistic) doctrine, Christian living, and perseverance. What he had to say would have sounded dry in Latin, but significantly, no Latin sermons by Jordan have survived.
Jordan was renowned for his knowledge, especially of the breviary, missal, the Bible, and its marginal notes, and the second half of the "Summa Theologiae", all of which he had memorised, according to the chronicle of the Dominican convent of Pisa.

GamersGate

GamersGate AB is a Sweden-based online video game store offering games for Windows, OS X, and Linux and electronic guides via download. It is a competitor to online video game services such as Valve's Steam, Direct2Drive and Impulse. 
GamersGate sells games for over 250 publishers and developers, including Electronic Arts, Atari, Bethesda Softworks, 2K Games, Ubisoft, SEGA, Capcom, Paradox Interactive and Epic Games but also smaller independent video game development developers such as 2D Boy, Jonathan Blow and Amanita Design. As of January 2013, there are over 5000 games available through GamersGate.
History.
GamersGate was formerly operated by Paradox Interactive. It was started with the intention of providing cheap distribution of their games to countries that did not offer them in physical retail stores. GamersGate commenced trial operations in April 2006 and officially launched (entitled "Gamer's Gate") on November 20, 2006. In 2008, after other publishers requested that GamersGate distribute their games as well, Paradox decided to separate GamersGate into its own company.
Client Free.
GamersGate initially required a software client for its customer to download their purchased games, but on January 28, 2009, the company began allowing customers to download their purchased games through a micro-download. The system uses a small program downloaded for every game that only works for getting the install files to the customers computer. Upon completion, the user installs the game and the downloader may then be removed from the computer. CEO Theo Bergquist has touted the client-less feature of GamersGate as a way to distinguish it from more dominant video game distribution platforms like Valve's Steam.
OS X Games.
In June 2009 GamersGate launched support for Mac games. The service first only sold the Mac versions of games separately, but it now offers both PC and Mac versions of selected titles at no extra cost. As of August 2011, there are over 400 Mac titles available on GamersGate.
Void.
GamersGate launched a new service called "Void" which allows customers with an account to download certain games for free in exchange for watching a few short advertisements. At release, ca 100 games were available in the Void catalogue. The Void service was ended in December 2012.
Downloadable content.
GamersGate were among the first to sell Downloadable Content for PC games, starting with downloadable content for the Hearts of Iron and Europa Universalis series. The service currently offers downloadable content for many of its bigger titles. It also offers developers a free In-game Downloadable Content API, called MicroSuite, which allows game companies to insert transactions into gameplay. MicroSuite is incorporated in games such as and Hearts of Iron III.

List of Ranma ½ episodes (season 4)

This article lists the episodes and short summaries of the 46th to 69th and 72nd episodes of the anime series, known in the English dub as the fourth season of "Ranma ½" or "Outta Control".
Rumiko Takahashi's manga series "Ranma ½" was adapted into two anime series: "Ranma ½" which ran on Fuji TV for 18 episodes and "Ranma ½ Nettōhen" which ran for 143. The first TV series was canceled due to low ratings in September 1989, but was then brought back in December as the much more popular and much longer-running "Ranma ½ Nettōhen".
Viz Media licensed both anime for English dubs and labeled them as one. They released them in North America in seven DVD collections they call "seasons". "Nettōhen" episodes 46 to 69 (excluding 51) and 72 are season 4, which was given the title "Outta Control". Episode 51 was inserted as episode 63 of season 3 and episode 72 was inserted into this season as episode 88, while 70 and 71 are in season 5.
The opening theme is by Yoshie Hayasaka. The first closing theme up to episode 54 is by Tokyo Shōnen, and the second is by Yoko Takahashi, also known as YAWMIN. The English dub only uses "Friends" as a closing, "Present" was never actually heard in the English dub.

That's Gold

That's Gold is a widely popular hand gesture in Australia. It is used to say that something is excellent. It was invented by Paul Harragon who is a host of the The Footy Show. Each week in a segment he shows to the audience photos and videos which are worthy of That's Gold.
How To Perform That's Gold.
That's Gold is performed with the person holding their left hand flat pointing to their right. The right hand is made into a fist and brought down onto the left hand.
Initially it was performed with the thumb up, but after some wrongful complains where people misunderstood the gesture as "the finger", the thumb was taken down.
Song.
Paul Harragon recorded a song called 'That's Gold' which all proceeds were going to charity. The song is based on the classic Spandau Ballet 80s hit of the same name and with the full endorsement of the original artists. That's Gold' is a fun, tongue-in-cheek pop record that will appeal not only to fans of Rugby League and The Footy Show, but pop fans in general.
That's Gold debuted at #6 on the ARIA Single Charts and #2 on the Physical Charts (#1 in NSW) on the 3rd of September 2007.

<doc id="19311065" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19311065" title="Total Performance">
Total Performance

Total Performance was a global promotional advertising campaign conducted by the Ford Motor Company during the 1960s. It aimed to succeed in a variety of motorsport venues, and then emphasize performance in their mainstream vehicles with the interest generated.
Motorsport.
The cream of Ford's efforts came on the race track and drag strip, which lent credence to the premise of their campaign. The Ford GT40 won overall in 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966, 1967, 1968, and 1969, and chalked up numerous victories in other endurance races such as the 12 Hours of Sebring and 24 Hours of Daytona. Legendary engines, like the big-block Ford 427 engine, and the Ford-sponsored Cosworth DFV were products of this era. Ford engines powered hundreds of victories in Formula One, NASCAR, CART, and other racing series. Ford-powered Lolas raced in the Can-Am series, and other Ford vehicles (most especially the Ford Escort) were successful in rallying.
Design changes.
The Ford Fairlane, Ford Falcon, and Ford Galaxie were stylistically modified in line with the performance image in the 1960s, given squared-off and more aggressive looks. The Ford Mustang, designed to look sporty in stock form, was given performance potential with the creation of in-house Ford designs such as the Boss 302 Mustang, Boss 429, as well as the Shelby Mustangs.
Production race cars.
Though in very small numbers, race cars were often modified for road use by Ford, either out of demand or for necessary homologation. The Ford 427 engine was available in special versions of the Galaxie and Fairlane. The Fairlane version was known as the Ford Thunderbolt. Versions of the Ford GT40 were built and sold for roadgoing use, and in kit car form they continue to be produced to this day. Modern cars like the Ford GT and Shelby GT500 are said to be the heirs to 1960s performance machines.
The end.
The Total Performance strategy was obsolete by the early 1970s. Though racing and performance promotions were conducted on a world scale, the fortunes of the strategy was mostly tied to the sale of muscle cars. With fuel economy, emissions cleanliness, and lower automobile insurance costs as new and overriding consumer demands, performance was quickly de-emphasized.

<doc id="19311090" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19311090" title="Sanskrit Press and Depository">
Sanskrit Press and Depository

The Sanskrit Press and Depository was set up in 1847 by Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Madan Mohan Tarkalankar in 1847 with a loan of 600 rupees, quite a large sum of money in those days. 
Vidyasagar began the Sanskrit Press with a couple of safe publishing bets: an edition of Bharat Chandra Ray’s "Annadamangal Kavya", a popular epic, for which his copy-text was a rare manuscript owned by the Krishnanagar zamindars, and the "Betal Panchabingshati" (Twenty Five Tales from a Demon), a traditional collection of Indian folk tales. Madan Mohan Tarkalankar began in 1849 an illustrated series for children, Shishu Shiksha (A Child’s Lessons), the third number of which was Vidyasagar’s "Bodhodoy" (The Dawn of Understanding, 1850). With "Bodhodoy" began Vidyasagar's project to reform and modernise Bengali primary education, using the Sanskrit Press as a laboratory for his experiments. 
In 1865 he produced one of the most successful Bengali primers ever, the "Varna Parichaya" (Bengali pronunciation Borno Porichoy). This book, whose title loosely translates as "Learning One's Letters" or "An Introduction to the Bengali Alphabet", is much more than a simple alphabet book, and contains short moralistic tales, aphorisms and epigrams which quickly became proverbial in 19th century Bengal. Its purpose was to displace the ubiquitous "Shishubodhak", "Ballobodh", "Bornobodh", etc., popular textbooks written by many hands and comprising a bizarre mix of folktales, proverbs, rules for negating curses, shlokas from the "Arthashastra", and other edifying fragments. These books were barely suitable for children and were more like grab-bags of useful knowledge for the average householder. Partly swayed by influences from the 19th century England, Bengal in the mid-19th century was busy inventing childhood as a category, a difficult business in a society where children were routinely married off before puberty. Vidyasagar provided the intellectual basis for constructing a pedagogy of the child mind in Bengal, and he backed it up on the one hand with actual publishing programmes, and on the other with his campaign for widow remarriage and the raising of the age of consent. However, in later ages Vidyasagar's style of teaching and moral aphorisms began to be regarded as stuffy and old-fashioned; this was less Vidyasagar's fault than the failure of subsequent generations to update his legacy appropriately.
Another area in which Vidyasagar's experience as a printer gave him unique knowledge was in the reform of Bengali typography and printing. Vidyasagar reformed Bengali typography into an alphabet of twelve vowels and 40 consonants and grappled with the problem of "joined letters" which continues to plague typographers of Bengali in the digital age.

Henry Jones (writer)

Henry Jones (2 November 1831 – 10 February 1899) was an English author well known as a writer and authority on tennis and card games who wrote under the nom de plume "Cavendish".
Biography.
Henry Jones was born in London, the eldest son of surgeon Henry Derviche Jones. He attended King's College School, Wimbledon from 1842 to 1848, and entered St Bartholomew's Hospital as a student during the 1849/50 session. His signature can be seen in the hospital’s archives in the student signature book (a book that students signed when they began their studies) for the 1849/50 and 1850/1 sessions, where his address is given as 23 Soho Square.
Jones qualified MRCS (Member of the Royal College of Surgeons) in 1852 and practised medicine as a GP until 1869 when he changed tack and became a full-time writer on games and sport. His writing career can be traced back to 1857 when he began writing about whist. Jones’s father had been a keen devotee of this trick-taking card game, and under his tutelage, Jones had become a good player at an early age. He was a member of several whist clubs, among them the Cavendish Club, and in 1862 he published "The Laws and Principles of Whist: Stated and Explained and its Practice Illustrated on an Original System by Means of Hands Played Completely Through by "Cavendish"", which became the leading authority on the game. This work was followed by treatises on the laws of the card games piquet and ecarte. Jones became widely known as "Cavendish" (his nom de plume), and wrote extensively in "The Field", the world’s original country and fieldsports magazine, which was founded in 1853. "Cavendish" also wrote on billiards, lawn tennis and croquet, and contributed articles on whist and other games to the ninth edition (1911) of the "Encyclopædia Britannica". "Cavendish was not a law-maker, but he codified and commented upon the laws which had been made during many generations of card-playing." One of the most noteworthy points in his character was the manner in which he kept himself abreast of improvements in his favourite game.
In 1869, Jones joined the "All England Croquet Club", which had been founded the previous year. He was later voted onto the club’s committee, and was Secretary for a brief period in 1871. In 1875, Jones proposed that one of the club’s croquet lawns should be set aside for the playing of lawn tennis. This proved to be a significant step. In 1877, the Club Secretary John Walsh proposed that a lawn tennis championship be held, and 'The Championships' were born. Henry Jones and two other prominent men, Julian Marshall and John Moyer Heathcote, formed a sub-committee to frame the rules, many of which survive today, and, from 1877 to 1885, Jones was referee at The Championships.
The only event held during the 1877 Wimbledon Championship was the Gentlemen’s Singles, which was won from a field of 22 competitors by Spencer Gore, an old Harrovian rackets player. The final attracted a crowd of about 200 spectators, who each paid one shilling. Today, Centre Court tickets for Gentleman’s Finals Day – on the Sunday of the second week of The Championships – cost £75. 
The Ladies’ Singles tournament was not inaugurated until 1884, when Maud Watson became the champion from an entry of just 13 players. The same year, the Gentlemen’s Doubles was started, with a trophy donated to the club by Oxford University Lawn Tennis Club following the cessation of their own doubles championship.
Henry Jones died in 1899. Unfortunately, the fortunes of Wimbledon were then at a low ebb. Public affection for The Championships had waned for a period in the 1890s, and as a result, Jones’s obituaries ignored his role in lawn tennis. It is sad that Jones did not live to see Wimbledon recover from this brief slump and go on to become the success that it is today.

According to legend, Yongzheng Emperor of the Qing dynasty may not have died of natural death and was actually assassinated. The plot is an imaginative time-traveling story based on the continuation of what happens after the assassination attempt.
The drama is produced by TVB under executive producer Siu Hin-fai. With an average of 2.21 million viewers (34 points), the drama is the fourth highest rating drama series of 2003. It received five nominations at the TVB Anniversary Awards, winning four. Maggie Cheung Ho-yee won the TVB Anniversary Award for Best Actress and one of twelve My Favourite Television Character awards, while Paul Chun won My Favourite Powerhouse Actor. Kwong Wa was nominated for the TVB Anniversary Award for Best Actor, and won one of twelve My Favourite Television Character awards.
Plot.
Qing dynasty.
The story begins in Qing dynasty, China with Yongzheng Emperor disguising himself among commoners to have a meal outside the imperial courts. At the restaurant he encounters a woman named Lui Sei-leung who was under attack by loan sharks for not returning debts. The emperor comes across her situation, and pays off the debt for her. Later during a ship departure, Lui approaches the emperor and thanks him for his deed. She suddenly reveals herself to be a Ming Dynasty revolutionist and attempts to kill the emperor. The boat is then all of a sudden caught in a time-traveling vortex/hurricane.
Modern Hong Kong.
When they wake up, they are both warped to modern Hong Kong in 2003. The assassin continues her mission to assassinate the emperor in the city, only to find out that he became a commoner and impersonates Lee Dai-ha (literally Big Shrimp Lee). The emperor is somewhat fascinated by the bermuda triangle and was looking for explanations of his time travel. They also learn about the fall of the Qing dynasty including the rise of the 1911 Xinhai Revolution and founding of modern China through a historic TV video, which also mentioned the emperor's death was shrouded in some mystery.
Both the emperor and the assassin encounter difficulties with HK daily life, culture and society. They both end up working in a company that sells kitchen tiles. The emperor and the assassin often find themselves collaborating to deal with opposing co-workers who dislike them. The emperor later fell in love with Rachel, the office worker. The story then becomes a more romantic drama, as the assassin also falls in love with him. She feels there is a special connection between them since they both were from the same dynasty. They end up living together with a host of other characters. The show also contains mini plots such as Ko King getting accused of carrying illegal drugs in a club, Hugo and Kenneth's homosexual relationship, and many other side stories.
Viewership ratings.
The following is a table that includes a list of the total ratings points based on television viewership. "Viewers in millions" refers to the number of people, derived from TVB Jade ratings, in Hong Kong who watched the episode live. The peak number of viewers are in brackets.

SAI KZ IV

__NOTOC__
The SAI KZ IV was a light twin-engined aircraft first built in Denmark in 1944 for use as an air ambulance. 
Design and construction.
It was a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane with twin tails, mounted on the ends of the horizontal stabiliser. Power was provided by two engines mounted in nacelles on the wings that also housed the main units of the fixed, tailwheel undercarriage. The cabin could hold two stretchers, two medical attendants, and a flight crew of two. 
Operational history.
A single machine, registered "OY-DIZ", was built during the war, with a second aircraft registered "OY-DZU" being built and flown in 1949. That same year, the OY-DIZ was christened with the name "Folke Bernadotte" in honour of the Swedish count who had used this very aircraft to make a diplomatic visit to Germany to negotiate for the release of Danish prisoners in German concentration camps near the end of the war. This aircraft is now the "flagship" of the Danmarks Flymuseum collection, having been restored to its original wartime configuration and markings following a career as a utility aircraft in England and a crash in 1979. The second aircraft was actively operational until the mid 1960s.

Thomas Herier

Thomas Herier, Erier, Erriers, or Erars ("fl." 1240–1270) was a Picard trouvère associated with the "Arras school". 
Herier is not mentioned in contemporary documents and all that is known about him is derived from his works. He composed a "jeu parti" with Gillebert de Berneville and possibly another with Guillaume le Vinier. He addressed one poem to "Jakemon of Cyson" (Jacques de Cysoing) and another to a "Trésorier", probably either the Trésorier de Lille or the Trésorier d'Aire. His relation to Arras is established by his references to a local banker, Audefroi Louchart, and the local sheriff, Mikiel le Waisdier. He also mentions in his poems Jeanne, Countess of Ponthieu, and the Sire du Roeulx (Rués). 
According to Theodore Karp, "Herier's poetry displays a certain elegance, but is commonplace in thought and imagery." His poems are heptasyllabic with the exception of the decasyllabic "Mais n'os chanter" and generally isometric. All his melodies are in bar form save for the "descort" "Un descort vaurai retraire". None of them survive in mensural notation. Karp considers "Bien me sui aperceus" and "Ja ne lairai mon usage" to be more ornate than the others.

Ybbs Valley Railway

The Ybbs Valley Railway () was a narrow-gauge railway of the Austrian Federal Railways with a track gauge of , located in the Lower Austrian Mostviertel.
The original route followed the valley of the river Ybbs from Waidhofen an der Ybbs to Kienberg Gaming, with a branchline to the town of Ybbsitz. A small section from Waidhofen an der Ybbs to Gstadt still operates as Waidhofen City Railway (), while the route from Lunz am See to Kienberg Gaming is currently operated as a heritage railway under the name "Ybbsthalbahn-Bergstrecke" (mountain line). Plans are under way to extend the heritage section to the town of Göstling, where tracks of the old railway are still in place.
Route.
Waidhofen an der Ybbs - Lunz am See.
The Ybbs Valley Railway starts from the narrow-gauge railway platform opposite the main standard gauge station at Waidhofen am der Ybbs, where the workshops are located. Until the end of freight service transhipment from normal to narrow gauge was done in this station. The railway first serves several halts in the city of Waidhofen, crossing a spectacular viaduct over the town, until it comes to the station at Gstadt at the 6 km mark which is the end of the line since 12 December 2010. This station used to be the junction for the branch line to Ybbsitz. 
The main route closed since December 2010 then followed the river Ybbs, which it crossed three times. The next large station was Opponitz, the location of the only tunnel of the Ybbs Valley Railway, and then after 25 km Hollenstein an der Ybbs (station Großhollenstein). This section from here gained altitude, as it followed the valley of the upper Ybbs.
This section served mainly smaller stops, which were used mainly by hikers during the summer, only Sankt Georgen am Reith providing much local passenger traffic. At kilometre 44 is the tourist town of Göstling in the Scheibbs district. From July 2012 the line beyond this point to Lunz am See was due to re-open as a heritage railway, joining the existing operation from Lunz over the Pfaffenschlag pass to Kienberg Gaming. However, the re-opening of this extension has been delayed. The Lunz - Keinberg Gaming section was closed in May 1988 and has operated since 1990 as a heritage railway.
At Kienberg Gaming it connected to the standard gauge Erlauf Valley Railway, now closed as far as the district capital, Scheibbs. 
A gauge forestry railway up the valley of the Ois river terminated at Lunz am See station until it closed in the 1970s.
Gstadt - Ybbsitz.
Gstadt station used to be the junction for the branch line until December 2010, this line branching off the main route and crossing the Ybbs on a steel girder bridge. The line, which followed the valley of the Kleine Ybbs (Little Ybbs), served several small stops and ended after six kilometers in the market town of Ybbsitz. The line crossed several level crossings, resulting in conflict with automobile traffic. Track removal on this line started in July 2013.
Gaming - Lunz am See (preserved railway).
The starting point of the museum railway today is the station at Kienberg-Gaming, the original terminal of the Ybbs Valley Railway and formerly the last stop of the standard gauge Erlauf Valley Railway of the ÖBB. This line is now closed beyond Scheibbs. At Kienberg-Gaming are the railway's facilities: the locomotive shed with workshop, which has been increased in size by the ÖGLB, a turntable, and a newly built carriage shed.
Shortly after leaving Kienberg-Gaming station the railway crosses a main road, and a little later, on a steel framework bridge, the Pockaubach and the road to Gresten. The alignment follows a steep wooded mountain saddle-back up to the summit of the Pfaffenschlag, at which first the stop, Gaming, is reached. The scenery opens up here to offer a beautiful panorama view over the region and the Kartause Gaming, after which the railway enters a steep rocky section in dense forest, and runs through many deep cuttings. In this section are the two landmarks of the "mountain line", two steel trestle viaducts, a bridge type otherwise only used in Austria on the Stubaitalbahn. The maximum grade on this section of the Ybbs Valley Railway is 3.44% (1:29), which is the steepest gradient of any Austrian narrow-gauge railway with a track gauge of 760 mm.
The highest point the railway, 699 m, is reached at Pfaffenschlag, which also highest point of the parallel pass road. At this station the steam engines replenish their water supply, then the railway follows the valley of the Bodingbach. The tracks run through several deep rock cuttings, and in particularly steep area solid retaining walls are used. The railway soon reaches the first houses of the summer-resort Lunz am See and runs through a forest of wood-apples. The railway then runs partially close area between the roofs of houses and a cliff. After crossing the Bodingbach the railway reaches the station of Lunz am See, which it used in conjunction with the section of the Ybbs Valley Railway formerly run by the ÖBB but now closed as far as Gstadt, though the track is still intact.
History.
There were plans in 1870 to build a railway up the valley of the Ybbs to Kienberg Gaming. The collapse of the stock market of Vienna in 1873 brought a sudden end to this project. In the 1880s representatives of the Ybbstal again looked at building a secondary line, however only in 1893 did negotiations with the government Ministries begin. On 26 December of the same year a law was passed for the building of the Ybbs Valley Railway. Consequently a decree of the Ministry of the Interior was given on the 11 September 1895 for the establishment of a corporation with the capital investment of 1,612,000 guldens.
The turning of the first sod for the initial section from Waidhofen to Gross Hollenstein took place at Waidhofen on 1 June 1895. The opening of this section took place on 15 July 1896. Three years later, on 15 May 1898, the second section from Gross Hollenstein to Lunz am See was opened. The section from Lunz am See - the so-called "Bergstrecke" - to Kienberg-Gaming, the most difficult section to construct, was opened later that year, on 12 November. Thus the entire 71 km route was constructed over a period of only 3 years.
With the building of the railway, the practice of rafting timber down the river ceased as it was unable to compete. The iron and steel processing industry was however tied up better with the ore mines on the Erzberg mountain and this industry prospered.
Closure of the mountain line and re-opening as a museum railway.
The heavily-graded section of the Ybbs Valley Railwayknown as the "Bergstrecke", with a length of 17.5 kilometers, connected the upper Ybbstal around Lunz am See and Göstling an der Ybbs with the Erlauftal, where it connected to the standard gauge line to the town of Scheibbs. The drift of passengers to buses and private cars on the faster road connection over the Grubberg pass road, as well as the transit of almost all goods traffic through Waidhofen led to a continuous decline in income. These developments led finally in May 1988 to the closure of this section of the railway.
The Austrian Society for Local Railways (ÖGLB) already successfully operated the Höllental Railway as a museum railway at this time, the operating company being the NÖLB (Niederösterreich local railways). The NÖLB leased this section from ÖBB and commenced operation as a museum railway in 1990 under the name "Ötscherland Express". Later the railway was renamed the "Ybbsthalbahn-Bergstrecke" (Ybbs Valley Railway mountain line).
Economic importance.
The economic importance of the Ybbs Valley Railway was particularly great from its completion in 1898 to about 1960. Today important companies such as Welser or the Böhler Uddeholm company have their parent plants in Ybbsitz and Böhlerwerk and were over many years the major employers in this region. By working with these industries and their meeting their need for efficient transport the railway also became an important employer.

Trinity Cathedral (Omaha, Nebraska)

Trinity Cathedral is located at 113 N. 18th Street in Downtown Omaha, Nebraska. Nebraska's first Episcopal parish, Trinity was established in 1856, and became the state's first Episcopal cathedral in 1872. Designed by noted English architect Henry G. Harrison in 1880, the Cathedral was consecrated on November 15, 1883. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Today Trinity Cathedral is considered one of the most beautiful churches in Omaha.
History.
Trinity was begun organized by the Right Reverend David Jackson Kemper on July 13, 1856. The first church was built at South Ninth and Farnam Streets. The congregation lost control of the first church building in 1864; the second building was lost to fire in 1868. The third church was built the next year, and was used until the Cathedral was constructed. The Right Reverend Robert Harper Clarkson broke ground for the new cathedral, later laying the cornerstone on May 25, 1880. The cost of the Cathedral was about $100,000 by the time it was completed three years later.
The church served as the base of many Episcopal missions to areas of the western United States. It is the episcopal seat of the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Nebraska.
Design.
Built in the late Late Gothic Revival style with rock-faced masonry walls and stone tracery over more than 43 stained glass lancet windows. The church is almost entirely of bluestone from Illinois in a design that is nearly cruciform with an entry tower extending outward. The exterior of the building has more than six stone crosses at varying points of its roof line.
The interior features Gothic design throughout, including aisles, nave, transept, choir, and a clerestory. The church includes a noted carved oak bishop's throne and dean's stall.

Sibriex

In the "Dungeons & Dragons" fantasy role-playing game, the sibriex is a type of demon.
Publication history.
The sibriex first appeared in third edition in ' (2006).
The sibriex, the sibriex chain master, the sibriex flesh crafter, and the sibriex spawn appeared in fourth edition in "Demonomicon" (2010).
Description.
3rd edition.
Sibriexes belong to the ancient race of demon called obyrith. Being obyriths, sibriexes have monstrous forms, which can drive mad anyone who dares look at them. Sibriexes are among the most ancient and mysterious inhabitant of the Abyss. Sibriexes resemble enormous deformed faces floating in the air, linked to the ground by metal chains.
Sibriexes enjoy modelling flesh. It is whispered that they could have a role in the shaping of the actual forms of the tanar'ri and that, for this reason, they have survived the destruction of the obyrith race. However, the number of these creatures is now very low, accounting about few hundreds of them.
4th edition.
When Tharizdun plunged the Shard of Evil into the heart of the Elemental Chaos, he freed the last of the obyriths from their decaying universe. The most powerful of those creatures became demon lords, even as the lesser members of their kind were absorbed by absolute corruption as the Abyss was born. The demons known as sibriexes were spawned from clans of obyrith slavers, savants, and flesh crafters. They haunt the Abyss and the planes beyond, dedicated only to increasing their own power.
Lore.
Like the obyriths from which they are spawned, sibriexes are creatures of an alien universe. Demonologists argue over what motivates these mad creatures, but the inner workings of the sibriex mind might never be known. Regardless, their chaos manifests as a thirst for the subjugation, transformation, and destruction of all other creatures. The other demons with which the sibriexes are now kin they regard as raw material for their experiments.
Types.
Chain Master.
Hovering over the wasted abyssal landscape, the sibriex chain master appears as an enormous, deformed head that seems to be tethered to the ground by heavy chains. As it approaches, panic sets in among its foes, a nameless revulsion shattering their resolve.
Combat.
As its "Sibriex Horror" aura spreads debilitating fear among its enemies, a chain master soars across the battlefield, making devastating melee attacks. When a number of its foes are immobilized or knocked prone, the chain master unleashes bile spout to reduce them to pools of acidic gore.
Flesh Crafter.
The flesh crafter is the artist of demonic forms, employing its flesh-warping disease to corrupt the forms of its foes.
Combat.
The battlefield is the flesh crafter's playground, allowing it to experiment in the creation of new demonic forms. The creature uses its melee and ranged attacks to restrain and expose foes to the flesh warp disease, then unleashes instant warp.
Spawn.
The foul nature of the sibriexes can infect other creatures, creating vile spawn beholden to more powerful masters. It is the only one that barely understands Abyssal.
Combat.
These misshapen spawn surge ahead of their more powerful allies in battle. They trust in their aura of fear to sow chaos, waiting for the attack that reduces them to an explosion of deadly bile.
Encounters.
The sibriex are arrogant creatures that have no equals among their allies. They are found either as the lords of lower-level thralls, or under the dominion of a powerful demon lord. Even when serving a more powerful master, a sibriex seeks out any opportunity to free itself, growing increasingly ruthless and cruel in the process.

Dryandra ser. Floribundae

"Dryandra" ser. "Floribundae" is an obsolete series within the former genus "Dryandra" (now "Banksia" ser. "Dryandra"). It was first published by George Bentham in 1870, and was given a new circumscription by Alex George in 1996, but was ultimately discarded in 2007 when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele sunk "Dryandra" into "Banksia".
According to Bentham.
Bentham's definition of "D." ser. "Floribundae" encompassed the species with inflorescences that were very much exposed, because their floral leaves were either very short or "few and spreading". The placement and circumscription of the series may be summarised as follows:
According to George.
Bentham's arrangement stood until 1996, when Alex George published his revision of "Dryandra". George transferred "D. carduacea" (which was then named "D. squarrosa" subsp. "squarrosa") and "D. polycephala" into "D." ser. "Armatae", and placed "D. carlinoides" and "D. kippistiana" in "D." ser. "Acrodontae". This left only "D. floribundae" (which was then named "D. sessilis") in "D." ser. "Floribundae". The series was defined in terms of the distinguishing characteristics of "D. sessilis"; for example it was noted that "the apparent absence of floral bracts is unique in the genus."
George's placement and circumscription of "D." ser. "Floribundae", as amended in 1999 and 2005, may be summarised as follows:
Recent developments.
Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses have provided compelling evidence of the paraphyly of "Banksia" with respect to "Dryandra"; that is, it seems that "Dryandra" arose from within the ranks of "Banksia". Early in 2007, Mast and Kevin Thiele initiated a rearrangement of "Banksia" by sinking "Dryandra" into it as "B." ser. "Dryandra". This transfer necessitated the setting aside of George's infrageneric arrangement of "Dryandra"; thus "D." ser. "Floribundae" is no longer current. Mast and Thiele have foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" is complete.

Change-of-shift report

In nursing, a change-of-shift report is a meeting between nursing staff members at the change of shift in which information pertaining to patients is exchanged. Report is generally given by the nurses in charge of one shift to those coming on for the next, and in some facilities, nurse assistants (Personal Support Worker is the title for a similar type of health worker in Canada.) participated in report, though the charge nurse is primarily responsible for making the report.
During report, the outgoing nurses discuss with the oncoming nurses the condition of each patient and any changes that have occurred to the patient during the shift. For nurses who regularly work with these patients, they can learn about any updates in the conditions of the patients. For nurses not normally assigned to the unit, they will learn about the patients on the unit. For all nurses, they will learn about any new patients who have recently been admitted to the unit.
Issues with report.
While report is necessary in order to communicate important information between nurses, various problems are posed by the giving of report.
Nurses in many places are legally not permitted to leave the facility until they have given report. Walking off the job may be considered abandonment, which may be grounds for revocation of the nurse's license. At the same time, facilities are not legally required in all places to pay nurses for the extra time beyond their shift they are forced to stay over to complete report.
While privacy laws require report to be given in a location where patients, visitors, and non-nursing staff cannot hear the report, some facilities prohibit family members from visiting patients during report times.

HC Kometa Brno

HC Kometa Brno ("Comet" in English) is the second most successful ice hockey club in the Czech Republic with 11 Czechoslovak league titles (right after HC Dukla Jihlava which have 12 titles). With three European Cup titles, Kometa is also the most successful Czech club in international ice hockey.
History.
The club was founded in 1953 as an army ice hockey club with the name Rudá hvězda Brno ("Red Star"). The majority of players were transferred from 2 hockey clubs in Brno (TJ Spartak Brno Zbrojovka and TJ Spartak GZ Královo Pole). In 1962 the club changed its name to ZKL Brno (ZKL is abbreviation of "Ball Bearing Factory") and stopped being an army team. In 1976 the name was changed to Zetor Brno. Shortly after revolution (1994), club changed its name to HC Kometa Brno. "Kometa" was the team's nickname since 1950's (opposite to official "Red Star") and the team was commonly referred to by this name since its beginnings.
In 1996 the team relegated from Czech Extraliga to the second highest ice hockey league – Czech 1. liga. For many years, the team struggled due to bad financing, multiple changes of owners and faced another relegation, which happened in 2001-2002 season. The club almost ceased to exist, played in the East division of the third highest Czech ice hockey league - 2. liga. By 2003-2004 season, it returned to 1. liga and began its little "renaissaince". In 2004, Kometa played its first playoffs since 1997, reached semifinals in 2008 and finals in 2009. On 1 April 2009, Kometa bought the licence for Czech Extraliga from another South Moravian club, HC Znojemští Orli. This club will now serve as a farm team for Brno.
In March 2012, the team managed to defeat HC Sparta Praha, the winner of the 2011–12 Czech Extraliga regular season, and qualified for the playoff semifinals. In the semifinals, they defeated HC Plzeň 1929, the runner-up of the regular season. Kometa lost the Czech Extraliga championship final to HC Pardubice in six games.
