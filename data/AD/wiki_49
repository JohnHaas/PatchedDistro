Deutschland incident (1902)

The "Deutschland" incident of 1902 occurred in March of that year with a German passenger steamer from the Hamburg America Line named SS "Deutschland". During a famous passage over the Atlantic, where the ship was carrying Prince Heinrich, the brother of the Kaiser back to Europe from a highly publicized visit to the United States, the steamer was prevented from using her Slaby-d'Arco system of wireless telegraphy as the Marconi radio stations refused its radio traffic through their nets and blocked the rival system. Prince Henry, who tried to send wireless messages to both the US and Germany, was outraged.
Marconi shore stations refused, except in the case of emergency, to accept messages from ships operating equipment from other sources. This brought up a number of questions of fairness — competitors claimed the Marconi companies were trying to set up a worldwide monopoly, while Marconi charged that his competitors were little more than parasites, wanting to take advantage of the investment his company had made in setting up the expensive shore stations.

The book was so successful that reviews appeared in "The Guardian", "The Spectator" and "The Independent", and it has been translated into both German as "Zum König!" (2004) and French as "3 pour voir le Roi" (2005).
Plot Introduction.
The nameless narrator lives in an isolated tin house situated on a windswept sandy plain, miles from his nearest neighbours whom he meets infrequently. He is quite happy in his lonely self-sufficiency until unexpectedly a woman comes to live with him. Unsettled at first, the narrator gradually gets used to the companionship. Then news comes of a new community being established on the edge of the plain by a charismatic, yet enigmatic figure who is digging a canyon and gaining more and more followers to his revolutionary cause. One by one, his neighbours join the canyon project, moving their tin houses to the new community as the narrator feels under increasing pressure to join them...

Vaccine refrigerator

Vaccine refrigerators are designed to store vaccines and other medical products at a stable temperature to ensure they do not degrade. In developing countries with a sunny climate, solar-powered vaccine refrigerators are common.
Requirements for vaccine refrigeration.
Many vaccines must be stored at low temperatures, some below -15°C, and others between 2 and 8°C. If vaccines are not stored correctly they can lose their effectiveness.
Solar powered vaccine refrigerators.
In developing countries the electricity grid often does not reach rural areas, and is not always reliable. As keeping vaccines at the appropriate temperature is vital, Solar powered refrigerators are a cost-effective alternative that can be highly reliable. A typical system will use a solar photovoltaic panel to generate electricity from sunlight, and a deep cycle battery to store energy for operation overnight, although newer fridges which have revolutionary Sure Chill Technology or Direct Drive technology do not need batteries to maintain temperatures for many days without sunlight.
WHO approved products.
The World Health Organisation maintains a list of products related to vaccines that it approves for use, including refrigerators.

James Dewar (baker)

James Alexander Dewer (February 5, 1897 – June 30, 1985) was an American inventor of the Twinkie.
Biography.
James was born on February 5, 1897 in Cook County, Illinois.
Dewer worked at the Continental Baking Company, which later through a series of mergers and acquisitions became Hostess Brands. He started as a delivery boy in 1920 by delivering pastries by horse-drawn cart. Dewar eventually rose up through the ranks to be a plant manager.
In 1931, Dewer's plant was making strawberry shortcakes but only during strawberry season. Dewar came up with an idea to create a shortcake with cream on the inside instead of strawberries. Having seen a billboard for a shoe company called the "Twinkle Toe Shoe Co." he was inspired to call his shortcake invention a "Twinkie".
Dewer rose to be regional vice-president at Hostess and held that position until 1972.
Dewer died on June 30, 1985 in Downers Grove, Illinois, at the age of 88.

Composer-Tron

The Composer-Tron was developed by Osmond Kendal for the Canadian Marconi Company in 1953.
It was the first analogue synthesis and composition instrument of its kind. It utilized a unique and innovative control system that had a cathode ray tube input device that could read shapes or patterns that was hand drawn on to its surface with a grease pencil. The drawn shape could define the timbre of the note, or the envelope shape of the sound. A sequence of the rhythmical markings could be defined using the writings similar to a cue sheet type strip of film.
This was the future innovation for composers. With Kendal's grease pencil, the composer could draw the grooves, run it through the Composer-Tron and can ensure that all written music was listened to first, before symphony orchestra’s played the music. Before the Composer-Tron composers would have to wait years just to listen if their work was complete. Sometimes their best work was never heard by the composer himself.
This invention was one of the first major steps that combined the producing efforts of the RCA Synthesizer, by Harry Olsen and Hebert Belar with the Marconi Company of America.

Thomas P. Campbell

Thomas P. Campbell, Ph.D. (born 1962), is the ninth director of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the largest art museum in the Western Hemisphere. After fourteen years as a curator in the Department of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts, specializing in tapestries, he was elected Director and CEO on September 9, 2008.
Biography.
Campbell has pursued an agenda for the Met that focuses on both scholarship and accessibility. These priorities maintain the museum's focus on exhibitions, publications, acquisitions, and permanent collections, while encouraging new thinking about the visitor experience. Further initiatives have included exploring the judicious use of technology in the Museum and fully integrating education into all the Met's activities. 
The Fiscal July 1, 2011-June 30, 2012 saw the Met's highest attendance in 40 years, rising to 6.28 million. During that year the Museum also opened extensive new galleries for both its Islamic and American art and launched a redesigned website that now attracts more than 44 million visits per year. The Museum is currently working on plans to renovate The Costume Institute and a project to redesign the Museum's Fifth Avenue plaza and fountains. Also on the horizon is a collaboration with the Whitney Museum in which the Met will program its landmark Breuer Building on Madison Avenue and 75th Street starting in 2015. 
Born in Singapore and raised in Cambridge, England, where he attended The Perse School, Campbell received his B.A. in English language and literature at New College, Oxford in 1984, followed by a Diploma from Christie's Fine and Decorative Arts course, London, in 1985. While studying for his Master's degree at the Courtauld Institute of Art (1987), he discovered the extent to which mainstream art history had overlooked the major role that the tapestry medium played in European art and propaganda. During the following years, he worked to rectify this by creating the Franses Tapestry Archive in London (1987–94), which, with more than 120,000 images, is the largest and most up-to-date information resource on European tapestries and figurative textiles in the world. His early research culminated in several groundbreaking research articles and a Ph.D. from the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London (1999) on the art and culture of King Henry VIII’s court. 
Campbell had worked in the Metropolitan Museum's Department of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts for fourteen years, rising steadily through the curatorial ranks as Assistant Curator (1995-97), Associate Curator (1997-2003), and Curator (2003 to December 2008). During this time, he conceived and organized the major exhibitions "Tapestry in the Renaissance: Art and Magnificence" (2002) and "Tapestry in the Baroque: Threads of Splendor" (New York, 2007; Palacio Real, Madrid, spring 2008), both of which incorporated drawings, paintings, and prints, as well as tapestries, and received widespread acclaim. The 2002 exhibition was named "Exhibition of the Year" by Apollo magazine and its catalogue won the Alfred H. Barr, Jr. Award (College Art Association) for distinguished exhibition catalogue in the history of art (2003) Since shortly after his arrival at the Museum, he also served as Supervising Curator of The Antonio Ratti Textile Center, which houses the Museum's encyclopedic collection of 36,000 textiles and is one of the preeminent centers of textile studies in the world.
Campbell has lectured and taught extensively on European court patronage and the relation of tapestries to the other arts, both to scholars and the general public, at institutions and museums in the United States and abroad. He has also published extensively on the subject of historic European textiles and their relationship to other art forms of their periods. He authored the book "Henry VIII and the Art of Majesty: Tapestries at the Tudor Court" (Yale University Press, 2007) and his articles have appeared in leading scholarly journals such as "Burlington Magazine", "Apollo Magazine", "Studies in the Decorative Arts", and "Gazette des Beaux-Arts". He has been the recipient of awards and fellowships, including the Iris Foundation Award (Bard Graduate Center) for a scholar in mid-career deserving of recognition for outstanding contributions to the study of the decorative arts (2003).
Dr. Campbell is married and lives in New York City. He and his wife Phoebe have a son and daughter.

USS "Pemiscot" (AK-201) was an "Alamosa"-class cargo ship that was constructed for the U.S. Navy during the closing period of World War II. By the time she was scheduled for commissioning, the war’s end caused her to be declared “excess to needs” and she was returned to the U.S. Government and struck by the Navy.
Built in Superior, Wisconsin.
"Pemiscot" (AK–201) was laid down under Maritime Commission contract by Globe Shipbuilding Co., Superior, Wisconsin, 7 July 1944; launched 18 November 1944; and transferred down the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River to New Orleans, Louisiana, between January and April 1945. Completed at the Pendleton Shipyard Co., she was transferred to the Navy 12 September 1945 at New Orleans.
Naval service.
"Pemiscot" was scheduled to commission 12 September. However, because of the Allied victory in the Pacific Ocean theatre of operations, her commissioning was delayed. 
Inactivation.
On 28 September she was ordered returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission, and was delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) at New Orleans 31 October. Her name was struck from the Naval Register 5 December 1945. She was subsequently renamed "Coastal Competition".

Foreign-body giant cell

A foreign-body giant cell is a collection of fused macrophages (giant cell) which are generated in response to the presence of a large foreign body. This is particularly evident with implants that cause the body chronic inflammation and foreign body response. 
This reaction to the implant causes damages to the infected area, leaving the exterior surface with scars. 
The nuclei are arranged in a disorganized manner. The nuclei in this cell are centrally placed and overlap each other. This is in contrast to a Langhans giant cell, where the nuclei are arranged on the border.

The "Arrow" class comprised six second-class screw-driven vessels built as despatch vessels for the Royal Navy in 1854, mounting 6 guns. In 1856 they were redesignated as second-class gunvessels.
Construction.
Design.
The Crimean War sparked a sudden need for shallow-draught, manoeuvrable vessels for inshore work in the Baltic and the Black Sea. The "Arrow" class of six wooden-hulled screw steamers were built during 1854 to a design by the Surveyor’s Department. Construction was undertaken at two commercial yards on the Thames, R & H Green at Blackwall Yard and C J Mare & Company, at Leamouth.--> Two further designs of Crimean War gunvessel were ordered during 1855, the "Intrepid" class and the "Vigilant" class, and in 1856 the six "Arrow"-class despatch vessels were re-classed as second-class gunvessels.
Propulsion.
A two-cylinder horizontal single expansion steam engine provided through a single screw.
Sail plan.
All "Arrow"-class gunvessels were barque-rigged.
Armament.
The "Arrow" class were provided with two 68-pounder Lancaster muzzle-loading rifles weighing on pivot mounts, and four 32-pounder guns.
Operational lives.
"Wrangler" was sent to the Baltic on completion, and the others of the class to the Black Sea where they took part in the Crimean War. The Lancaster guns were not entirely successful and the class had their armament reduced, being employed in their original designation as despatch vessels.

Pangani

Pangani is a town in northeast Tanzania that lies 45 km south of Tanga, at the mouth of the Pangani River. It is the headquarters of Pangani District.
Although archaeologists have found the remains of small 15th century settlements on the bluffs just north of Pangani, the modern town came to prominence in the nineteenth century, when, under nominal Zanzibari rule, it was a major terminus of caravan routes to the deep interior. From the 1860s onward townspeople established large plantations of sugar and coconut in Mauya, along the banks of the river just west of town. The plantations were worked by slave labor, and Pangani also became an important center of the slave trade, shipping captives taken in the wars attendant on the collapse of the Shambaa kingdom in the Usambara mountains to the plantations of Pemba and Zanzibar. After the Sultan of Zanzibar signed treaties with Great Britain outlawing the ocean-going trade in slaves in 1873, Pangani became a center for smuggling slaves across the narrow channel to Pemba, in evasion of British warships.
In 1888, Pangani was the center of an armed movement to resist German colonial conquest of the entire mainland Tanzanian coast. The local leader of the resistance was Abushiri ibn Salim al-Harthi, a Swahili-speaker born in Zanzibar who owned a small estate at the suburb that now bears his name. Abushiri was instrumental in coordinating resistance to German conquest along much of the coast. The Germans hanged him at Pangani in December 1889.
Several historical sites in and around the town serve as reminders of the strong Arabic influence and the later German and British colonial era in Tanganyika. The district boma or headquarters is the most impressive building remaining from the period of Zanzibari rule.
The Mauya plantations no longer grow sugar, but produce much coconut and betel-nut. Pangani was once a secondary center of the sisal industry, servicing sisal plantations to the north and south of town. Pangani also has a fishing industry. In recent years beach resorts north and south of the town have brought tourists. The town is a district headquarters. Its hospital draws patients from many parts of the region. Funguni Secondary School is in Pangani Town and Boza Secondary School is a short distance north.

1975 VFL Grand Final

The 1975 VFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football game contested between the Hawthorn Football Club and the North Melbourne Football Club, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne on 27 September 1975. It was the 79th annual Grand Final of the Victorian Football League, staged to determine the premiers for the 1975 VFL season. The match, attended 110,551 spectators, was won by North Melbourne by a margin of 55 points, marking that club's first premiership victory. In so doing, it became the last of the 12 VFL teams to win a flag.
Background.
North Melbourne had finished runners up the previous season, having been defeated by Richmond in the 1974 VFL Grand Final, and were the only team not to have won a premiership. This was Hawthorn's first appearance in a Grand Final in four years, having defeated St Kilda in the 1971 VFL Grand Final.
North Melbourne lost six of the first nine games of the season before finally hitting their stride, winning eleven of the next thirteen games. At the conclusion of the regular home-and-away season, Hawthorn finished first on the ladder with 17 wins and 5 losses, and North Melbourne had finished third (behind Carlton) with 14 wins and 8 losses. 
In the finals series leading up to the Grand Final, North Melbourne defeated Carlton by 20 points in the Qualifying Final before being beaten by Hawthorn by 11 points in the Second Semi-Final. They then met Richmond in the Preliminary Final which they won by 17 points to advance to the Grand Final. Hawthorn advanced straight to the Grand Final on the back of their win in the Second Semi-Final.
Hawthorn captain Peter Crimmins was overlooked for the 1975 Grand Final after being struck down by testicular cancer. Crimmins declared that he was fit to play after playing 5 reserve games, including one final, and both the selection committee and Hawthorn's supporters were divided over whether he should play. Ultimately the match committee decided against playing him in the game, with coach John Kennedy admitting they were fearful a knock could affect him. As he explained later: "It was very hard, it was a unique situation ... Peter wanted to play. The committee was divided. He didn't play. We'll never know what might have happened if he had played."
Match summary.
North Melbourne were on top from the beginning of the game, accumulating nine goals by half time to Hawthorn's five. After the half, North blew the game open, with its last six goals of the match extending the margin from 24 points to 61. Their final winning margin of 55 points was the biggest in a Premiership decider since the 1957 VFL Grand Final. 
Contributing strongly for North Melbourne were Brent Crosswell, John Rantall, Keith Greig, John Burns, David Dench, Mick Nolan, Sam Kekovich and Doug Wade. Arnold Briedis kicked five goals for the Kangaroos. Peter Knights stood out for Hawthorn.
The selection of full-forward Michael Cooke proved to be disastrous for Hawthorn. His four goals in the Semi Final (his league debut) helped the Hawks book a spot in the premiership decider, for which he kept his spot in the side. However, Cooke struggled in the Grand Final and was replaced without managing a kick. He never played another senior game.
It was in this game that Kennedy made his famous "Don't think, do" speech. As he recalled, "It was born out of desperation. We had some academics in the team who did a lot of thinking, so I, more or less in exasperation, said 'Don't think, do!"
Epilogue.
For North Melbourne it would be the final league game for captain Barry Davis, full-forward Wade and the versatile Gary Farrant. It was also the last time Rantall played with North as he returned to South Melbourne the following season.
This was the first of two consecutive Grand Finals to be contested between these teams. In the 1976 VFL Grand Final the fortunes were reversed, with Hawthorn running out winners by a margin of 30 points.
This was the last Grand Final to be played under one umpire. The 1976 Grand Final saw the introduction of two field umpires.

Midlands Merit League

The Midlands Merit League, was a summer rugby league tournament in England held between 2006 and 2009. It was a feeder league to the Rugby League Conference and had a season that runs from April to August. In its last season of 2009, it was also known as the RL Merit League.
It was superseded by the Midlands Rugby League, Yorkshire & Humber Merit League and North West Merit League.
History.
The league was founded as the "Midlands Merit League" in late 2005 to support the growth of rugby league in non-heartland areas. Originally intended as a stand-alone league, support from the Rugby Football League meant that it could be administered as part of the Rugby League Conference set-up. Interest quickly gathered with 13 teams showing an interest in participating in the inaugural season – 8 eventually participated. The first ever game took place on 8 April 2006 at All Saints Sports College, Sheffield, where the Sheffield Forgers beat the Chesterfield Spires by 58 points to 8.
The first cross-league fixture was played in June 2007 when Nottingham Outlaws Academy visited Northampton Casuals of the London League. They also played a return fixture in July.
The 2007 season saw the introduction of an informal under-15 league based on Merit League principles. In 2008 the junior competition featured under-14 and under-16 divisions.
The league was renamed Rugby League Merit League (RLML) for the 2008 season due to its increased geographical spread with teams from the North of England taking part. 2009 saw the largest ever entry, with over 30 teams split into two pools; "Yorkshire and Humber" and "North West" with the Midlands Rugby League becoming its own competition using merit league rules.
In 2010 the Yorkshire & Humber Merit League and North West Merit League became separate competitions.
Teams joining the Rugby League Conference.
The league has also proved popular with clubs in the Rugby League Conference (RLC) providing players or teams to the Midlands Merit League.

<doc id="19259715" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19259715" title="Climate change in Nevada">
Climate change in Nevada

Climate change in Nevada has been measured over the last century, with the average temperature in Elko, Nevada, increasing 0.6°F (0.3°C), and precipitation has increased by up to 20% in many parts of the state. These past trends may or may not continue into the future.
Potential changes.
Over the next century, experts suggest that climate in Nevada may change even more. Based on projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and results from the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research climate model (HadCM2), a model that accounts for both greenhouse gases and aerosols, by 2100, temperatures in Nevada could increase by 3-4°F (1.7-2.2°C) in spring and fall (with a range of 1-6°F and by 5-6°F (2.8-3.3°C) in winter and summer (with a range of 2-10°F [1.1-5.6°C). Precipitation is estimated to decrease in summer by 10% (with a range of -5% to -20%), to increase by 15% in spring, to increase by about 30% in fall, and to increase by about 40% in winter. Other climate models may show different results, especially regarding estimated changes in precipitation. The impacts described in the sections that follow take into account estimates from different models. The amount of precipitation received on extremely wet or snowy days in winter is likely to increase. The frequency of extremely hot days in summer would increase. It is not clear how the severity of storms might be affected, although an increase in the frequency and intensity of winter storms is possible.
Impact.
Water resources.
The sustained streamflow in Nevada largely results from spring and summer snowmelt in the mountains.
Earlier and more rapid snowmelts could contribute to winter and spring flooding, and more intense summer storms could increase the likelihood of flash floods. Although Nevada is extremely dry, intense rains can produce torrents of water and debris. Residential and industrial developments on valley floors and near the foothills are especially vulnerable during flash floods.
Agriculture.
In Nevada, production agriculture is a $300 million annual industry, two-thirds of which comes from livestock, mainly cattle. Almost all of the farmed acres are irrigated. The major crops are hay and potatoes. Climate change could have an impact on crop production, reducing potato yields by about 12%, with hay and pasture yields increasing by about 7%. Farmed acres could rise by 9% or fall by 9%, depending on how climate changes. Livestock production may not be affected, unless summer temperatures rise significantly and conditions become significantly drier. Under these conditions, livestock tend to gain less weight and pasture yields decline, limiting forage.
Forests.
With changes in climate, the extent of forested areas in Nevada could change little or decline by as much as 15-30%. The uncertainties depend on many factors, including whether soils become
drier and, if so, how much drier. Hotter, drier weather could increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires, threatening both property and forests. Drier conditions would reduce the
range and health of ponderosa and lodgepole pine forests in the northern and western areas of the state, and increase their susceptibility to fire. Grasslands, rangeland, and desert could expand into previously forested areas. Milder winters could increase the likelihood of insect outbreaks and of subsequent wildfires in the dead fuel left after such an outbreak. These
changes would significantly affect the character of Nevada forests and the activities that depend on them. Increased rainfall could reduce the severity of these effects.
Ecosystems.
The region's inherently variable and unpredictable hydrological and climatic systems could become even more variable with changes in climate, putting stress on wetland ecosystems. The streams and rivers in Nevada are entirely spring-fed or derived from runoff from the mountains. A warmer climate would increase evaporation and shorten the snow season in the mountains, resulting in earlier spring runoff and reduced summer streamflow. This would exacerbate fire risk in the late summer. These threats, coupled with increasing human demands on water resources, could severely reduce the number and quality of wetland habitats, which are already stressed and ephemeral. This would degrade habitat essential for migrating and breeding birds, and could further stress rare and endangered fish species. Many desert-adapted plants and animals already live near their tolerance limits, and could disappear under the hotter conditions predicted under global warming.

USS Pinellas (AK-202)

USS "Pinellas" (AK-202) was an "Alamosa"-class cargo ship that was constructed for the U.S. Navy during the closing period of World War II. By the time she was scheduled for commissioning, the war’s end caused her to be declared “excess to needs” and she was returned to the U.S. Government and struck by the Navy.
Career.
"Pinellas" (AK–202) was laid down under Maritime Commission contract by Globe Shipbuilding Co., Superior, Wisconsin. She was transferred to the Navy in March 1945. "Pinellas" was scheduled for commissioning. However, because of the Allied victory in the Pacific Ocean theatre of operations, her commissioning was cancelled. "Pinellas" was ordered returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission for disposal. She was subsequently renamed "Coastal Competition". Her subsequent fate is not known.

1991 Rome summit

The 1991 Rome summit was the 12th NATO summit bringing the leaders of member nations together at the same time. The formal sessions and informal meetings in Rome, Italy took place on November 7–8, 1991.
Background.
The United States, with Germany's support, proposed reconfiguring NATO's military. The military planners projections contemplated an emphasis smaller, highly mobile forces geared for fast reaction to an array of potential contingencies other than the defense of Western Europe against a conventional large-force assault. The re-constituted NATO-assets would be flexibly available for a broadly defined range of NATO-directed missions. The unanimous agreement with the essentials of these proposed changes was officially confirmed at the Rome summit. Although the French joined in principle in agreeing to the reformation of NATO's military, this did not signal that France would re-join NATO's military structure.
Accomplishments.
The "Alliance's New Strategic Concept" was published on the first day of the summit.
The Rome Declaration on Peace and Cooperation was issued on the second day of the summit.

1946 Open Championship

The 1946 Open Championship was the 75th Open Championship, played 3–5 July at the Old Course at St Andrews, Scotland. Due to World War II, it was the first Open since 1939, also held at St Andrews. Sam Snead won his only Open title, four strokes ahead of runners-up Johnny Bulla and Bobby Locke. It was the first win by an American in thirteen years and the second of Snead's seven major titles. Four Americans were in the field of 100; the three that made the cut all finished in the top ten.
In his second Open Championship appearance and first since 1937, Snead did not endear himself to the St Andrews crowd at first. His first impression of the course was "It looks like an old abandoned kinda place," ensuring a cold reception at the start of the tournament. He opened with a round of 71, two behind the lead of Locke. Henry Cotton took the lead after 36-holes with consecutive rounds of 70, one ahead of Snead. Snead, Bulla, and Dai Rees were tied for the lead going into the final round, with Cotton one behind. But it was Snead who was best able to navigate the strong winds of the final round. After dropping four shots on the front-nine, he was able to use his length and accuracy to record a 35 on the back for a round of 75 and a 290 total. Locke moved into 2nd place with a 76, while Bulla finished with a 79 to tie Locke. Rees tied for 4th with the help of a tournament record-tying round of 67 in the second round.
Snead's win here was his only Open Championship title and he played the tournament only three more times, not returning until 1962. He was the first American to win the title since Denny Shute in 1933.
Dick Burton, the 1939 champion, finally relinquished the trophy after seven years and finished in 12th place.

The 1947 Open Championship was a major golf tournament played at Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake, England. In the 76th Open Championship, Northern Ireland's Fred Daly became the first Irish winner of the Open Championship, one stroke ahead of runners-up Reg Horne and amateur Frank Stranahan. It was Daly's only major title.
Henry Cotton and Laurie Ayton shared the first round lead, but in the second round both fell back with rounds of 78 and 80, respectively. After 36-holes Daly owned a four-shot lead over Cotton. Daly had a poor third round, shooting 78 to fall into a tie for the lead with Cotton, Arthur Lees, and Norman Von Nida. There were a further nine players within three-strokes of the lead. Horne, who began two back, made the first move with a 35 on the front-nine. He took a pair of 5s at the 16th and 17th holes, however, and at the 18th his putt for a 3 lipped out. He finished with a 294 total. Daly began the round with a 38 on the front, but he recovered on the back and holed a birdie putt on the 18th to post 293. Cotton made the turn in 36 and needed a 35 on the back to tie Daly, but in the blustery wind this proved too difficult and he finished at 297. That left Stranahan as the last player on the course able to tie Daly. He reached the 17th needing to play the final two holes in 7, but a three-putt led to a 5 and saw him needing an improbable 2 on the last. He gave it a good shot, with his approach landing less than a foot from the hole.

Kenyan tea workers strike of 2007

Background.
A 16% wage increase for tea plantation workers was agreed to in 2006 through a process of collective bargaining between the KPAWU and employers in the Kenyan tea industry, including UTK. By September 2007, the wage agreement had been implemented by other multinational companies, but not by UTK, which argued that wages in Kenya were already higher than in other tea-producing countries in Africa. The KPAWU announced that it would take legal action against UTK unless the wage increase was implemented by 20 September 2007.
Strike.
The strike began on 8 September 2007 when 10,000 KPAWU members stopped work and brought operations at eighteen plantations to a halt. The action was declared illegal by the district labour officer, but the strike continued. It is unclear as to the level of support that the strike had within the KPAWU, as the Kericho chairman asked the strikers to return to work while the issue was investigated, while the KPAWU general secretary blamed UTK's actions for the strike.
A number of violent incidents occurred during the strike. Striking workers confronted and in some cases assaulted other workers who were not part of the strike. A plantation manager's house was destroyed at one estate, and a truck was set alight at another.
On 14 September 2007, UTK announced an 8% wage increase and the strike came to an end.

Charlie Ward, Sam King, and Flory Van Donck shot 69 to share the first round lead. Henry Cotton opened with a 71, then took the lead with a 66 in the second round, one off his own tournament record set in 1934. While scoring conditions in the first two rounds were ideal, with five other rounds of sub-70 in the second, the change in weather on the final day caused scores to soar. Over the final two rounds no player recorded a round below 70. Cotton carded rounds of 75-72 to set a clubhouse lead of 284 that no one came close to matching. Fred Daly came closest with a 289, five-shots behind.
Argentine Roberto De Vicenzo made his Open Championship debut and finished in third place. Over the next two years he followed with another third and a runner-up finish. He would eventually win the title 19 years later, in 1967.

The 1951 Open Championship was a major golf tournament held at Royal Portrush Golf Club in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It was the 80th Open Championship and the first played in Northern Ireland. Englishman Max Faulkner won his only major title in the rain, two strokes ahead of runner-up Antonio Cerdá of Argentina.
The purse was £1,700 with a winner's share of £300.
Jimmy Adams and Norman Von Nida shared the lead after the first round with 68, the only sub-70 rounds recorded in the tournament. Faulkner owned a two shot lead over Norman Sutton after the second round, then stretched the lead to six over Sutton and Cerdá after a second consecutive 70 in the third round. In the final round Faulkner carded a 74 to post a 285 total. Cerdá was the only player still on the course with a chance to tie, and he went to the 16th needing to play the last three holes in 12 shots. His challenge ended, however, when his drive ended up against some steps straddling a barbed wire fence and he settled for a 6. He finished with a 287, two shots behind Faulkner.
Faulkner would be the last Englishman to win the Open Championship for 18 years, until Tony Jacklin in 1969. Frank Stranahan tied for twelfth and was the low amateur for the third straight year, one of two Americans to make the cut.
Two Australians made their Open Championship debuts: future five-time champion Peter Thomson finished in 6th place, while 1960 Open champion Kel Nagle placed in 19th.
Through 2012, this is the only Open ever held in Northern Ireland, and the only time the event was held outside of England or Scotland. It was also the last Open to be held at a course outside the current rota of nine courses.

Hogan, with the Masters and U.S. Open titles under his belt, made the trip across the Atlantic for the Open Championship for the very first time. He arrived at Carnoustie two weeks early to practice with the smaller British golf ball. The 36-hole qualifier immediately preceded the championship, played Monday and Tuesday on the Championship and Burnside courses. In 1953, there were no exemptions, even defending champion Bobby Locke had to qualify. This policy, the small purse, and the conflict of schedule with the PGA Championship kept all but a few Americans at home; only four qualified for the first round on Wednesday and three made the 36-hole cut to play the final two rounds on Friday.
Although the field of 91 that qualified was mostly British, a strong international contingent stood ready to challenge Hogan, including fellow Americans Lloyd Mangrum and Frank Stranahan, Australian Peter Thomson, Antonio Cerdá and Roberto De Vicenzo of Argentina, and South Africa's Locke, the defending champion. 
The Open Championship was Hogan's third major title of the year, but the modern Grand Slam was not possible, as the PGA Championship conflicted with the Open in 1953. (The final match (36 holes) of the seven-day PGA Championship was played near Detroit on Tuesday, 7 July.) After his automobile accident in 1949, Hogan did not enter the PGA Championship until 1960, after it became a stroke play event. (He won the PGA Championship in 1946 and 1948.)
Hogan did not play in another Open Championship, although he did make a lasting impression on Carnoustie. The par-5 6th hole features a split fairway, with the right side being safer but the left offering a better angle to the green. Hogan found the narrow left side in each of the four rounds, and that hole is now known as "Hogan's Alley."
Through 2012, Hogan remains the only one to win the Masters, U.S. Open, and Open Championship in the same calendar year. After winning the first two majors of the year, both Arnold Palmer (1960) and Jack Nicklaus (1972) were runners-up by a stroke at the Open Championship. Tiger Woods shot 81-65 on the weekend in 2002 and finished six strokes back, tied for 28th place.

Syd Malcolm

Syd Malcolm (1902–1987) was an Australian rugby union player, a state and national representative half-back who captained the Wallabies' on seventeen occasions between 1928 and 1933.
__TOC__
Youth and representative debut.
Malcolm left Newcastle, New South Wales in his teens to seek work and found it at Ipswich, Queensland as a boilermaker. He played rugby league in 1925-26 with the St Paul's club in Ipswich, achieving representative honours for Queensland in 1925.
His first representative rugby union appearances were on the 1927-28 Waratahs tour of Britain, France and Canada for which Malcolm was one of three half-backs selected along with Wally Meagher and Jack Duncan from Randwick. Meagher started as the preferred Test half and when Malcolm dislocated his shoulder in the match against Oxford University not yet half-way into the tour it looked as though he would have disappointing memories of the trip.
He was side-lined for many matches (ultimately only playing in 11 of the 31 official tour matches) but his capabilities had been noticed. After his shoulder recovery he was selected in the final three Tests against Scotland, England and France. He finished the tour as Australia's number one half-back and returned to Newcastle a hero, but keen to relocate to Sydney to play club rugby there.
Playing style.
Malcolm provided quick service from the scrum base with a fast but not particularly long pass. He was quick to spot and exploit an opening but was most respected for his courage and determination when the going got tough. The Howell reference describes him as "courage personified".
Representative career.
When the Waratahs toured New Zealand in 1928 Malcolm was named as captain. The team was full of new blood with only Cyril Towers and Geoff Bland continuing on for the 1927 World Tour squad. Syd Malcolm played in seven of the ten matches; five in total were won and five lost.
In 1929 the All Blacks toured Australia, Tom Lawton took over as captain but Syd Malcolm was in the side which won all three Tests in an upset. With the Queensland Rugby Union now back in existence for the first time since 1919 this was the first truly national Wallabies side fielded since 1914 and the first time in history any nation had beaten the All Blacks in a 3-0 series whitewash.
Great Britain toured Australia in 1930 and Malcolm played in two tests and twice against them for New South Wales. Then in 1931 a full Australian side was sent to New Zealand. Syd Malcolm was the captain and part of the senior playing group with Cyril Towers and Alex Ross from the 1927 side. They won three, drew one and lost six matches including the single Test. In 1932 Malcolm again met the All Blacks in three Test appearances when they came to Australia - he was captain in one of those encounters but also captained New South Wales against them.
In 1933, Malcolm was in the squad that made Australia's first ever rugby tour of South Africa. He made eleven appearances including two Tests, one as captain. Syd Malcolm made his final international appearances against New Zealand in 1934, finishing his representative career after eight years and forty five internationals including eighteen Tests.

1954 Open Championship

The 1954 Open Championship was a major golf tournament held at Royal Birkdale Golf Club in Southport, England. Peter Thomson, age 23, won the first of his five Open titles by one stroke over runners-up Bobby Locke, Dai Rees, and Syd Scott.
Sam King and Bill Spence established a new course record in the first round with 69s. The record would last just one round, however, as Syd Scott bettered it in the second round with a 67, but Spence still held the 36-hole lead after a 72, one ahead of Antonio Cerdá and two in front of Scott, Dai Rees, Peter Thomson, and King. Scott continued his hot play in the third round, scoring a 69. Thomson and Rees also carded 69 and joined him at the top of the leaderboard going into the final round. Scott shot a 72 over the last 18-holes, posting a clubhouse lead of 284. Rees also posted 284 after missing a putt at the 18th. Thomson missed a short putt at the 12th, but managed to get up-and-down from a bunker at 16. He went to the 17th needing a par and a 5 to win the championship. He got the par, but at 18 he found trouble in a bunker. He again managed a superb recovery, and while he missed his first putt he easily tapped in for a round of 71 and a 283 total. Bobby Locke had a chance to tie Thomson with a 3 at the last, but his putt came up just short.
This win was the first in a run of three consecutive Open Championship titles by Thomson, becoming the first player since Bob Ferguson from 1880-82 to win three straight Opens. Altogether he would win three of the next four Opens and add another win in 1965, which was also held at Royal Birkdale. Thomson was the first Australian to win the Open Championship, and the youngest champion since Bobby Jones.
Three-time Masters champion Jimmy Demaret made his only Open Championship appearance this year, finishing in 10th place. This was the first Open Championship to be played at Royal Birkdale. Defending champion Ben Hogan did not compete; his victory in 1953 at Carnoustie was his only Open Championship.

1960 Open Championship

The 1960 Open Championship was the 89th Open Championship, played 6–9 July at the Old Course at St Andrews in St Andrews, Scotland. In the 100th anniversary of the first Open Championship, Australian Kel Nagle prevailed over Arnold Palmer by a single stroke in a tournament that marked the emergence of the Open Championship as a major stop for American golfers.
Prior to the first round on Wednesday, the field was reduced from 147 to 74 in the 36-hole qualifier on Monday and Tuesday, played on the New and Old Courses.
Roberto De Vicenzo opened the tournament proper with consecutive rounds of 67 on Wednesday and Thursday to take a two-stroke lead over Nagle. In the third round, De Vicenzo's drive on the 14th ended up on top of a wall and he finished the round with a score of 75, allowing Nagle to take a two-shot lead. Palmer, who had won the U.S. Open three weeks earlier by erasing a seven-shot deficit in the final round, was four back after 54-holes. The final round on Friday afternoon was delayed until Saturday due to a heavy rainfall that flooded portions of the course; the first postponement in over fifty years. When play resumed the next day, Palmer and Nagle both went out in 34. Still four-strokes behind, Palmer began another charge on the back. He made up strokes on the 13th and 15th, made a 4 on the 17th, then made birdie at the last. Nagle was standing over a crucial par putt on the Road Hole 17th when he heard the roar signifying Palmer's birdie at 18. He managed to collect himself and hole the putt, then made a safe 4 at the last to win the title by a single shot over Palmer.
Already 39 at the time of his victory, this was Nagle's first top ten finish in a major championship. Although little-known outside of Australia at the time of the tournament, he went on to have success throughout the next decade and came close to winning another major at the 1965 U.S. Open, losing to Gary Player in an 18-hole playoff.
Palmer had won the first two majors at the Masters and U.S. Open, and was attempting to equal Ben Hogan's 1953 season with a third consecutive major. His appearance established the British Open as an important tournament for American golfers and, although Palmer himself skipped the tournament a few times afterward, the best American players began crossing the Atlantic with regularity from then on. Palmer won the next two Opens in 1961 and 1962.
The appearance of Palmer, already the most popular golfer in the world, proved to be a turning point for the Open Championship. Until the 1960s, few Americans made the trip to the Open Championship, with the cost of traveling to Britain often more than they stood to win in the tournament. The 1960 event included only four Americans following the qualifieer, and only two made the cut. Ten years later, 24 Americans were in the field of 134. For many years, the event conflicted with the PGA Championship in the U.S., a more lucrative major which gradually moved to late July and then August.

1966 Open Championship

The 1966 Open Championship was the 95th Open Championship, held 6–9 July at Muirfield Golf Links in Gullane, East Lothian, Scotland. Jack Nicklaus won the first of his three Claret Jugs, one stroke ahead of runners-up Doug Sanders and Dave Thomas. It was the sixth of eighteen major titles for Nicklaus and marked the completion of the first of his three career grand slams.
The 1966 Open was the first to be scheduled over four days, with one round each day, finishing on Saturday. Previous Opens had played the third and fourth rounds on Friday. The U.S. Open changed to a four-day schedule the previous year in 1965, moving its final round from Saturday afternoon to Sunday. The Open Championship operated on a Wednesday through Saturday schedule through 1979.
It was the final Open for 1964 champion Tony Lema, who died in a plane crash two weeks later, hours after the PGA Championship.
Nicklaus has described Muirfield as "the best golf course in Britain." He later developed a championship golf course and community in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb north of his hometown of Columbus. Opened in 1974, Nicklaus named it Muirfield Village and it hosts his Memorial Tournament, a top invitational event on the PGA Tour since 1976.

PS Ripon

The PS "Ripon" was a paddlesteamer built at Money Wigram's Blackwall Yard in 1846 for P&O. The "Ripon" brought the first hippopotamus to the United Kingdom in 1850, and in 1854 was requisitioned for use in the Crimean War. In 1864 she brought Italian General Giuseppe Garibaldi to the United Kingdom for a meeting with Prime Minister Henry Palmerston. In 1870, the engines of the "Ripon" were sold, and the vessel was converted into a brig for Caird & Co in Greenock.

Phil Reay-Smith is Head of Media at the London branch of PR firm Ogilvy.
He was previously a television news journalist, working for EuroNews and ITN, and consumer editor on ITV breakfast show Daybreak.
Broadcasting career.
Phil joined ITN as a news correspondent in 2000. Initially working for the broadcaster's 24 hour news channel, he went on to cover such events as the 2001 Earthquake in Gujarat and the Boxing Day Tsunami in 2004. In 2003, he was embedded with the British army during the Iraq war, becoming the first British journalist to cross into Iraqi territory.
Phil was regarded as a multi-skilled journalist, often filming and editing his own packages. This style of journalism was evident in his investigative coverage of the 2005 UK General Election in reports known as the Outsider. He often specialised in reporting on adventure stories, such as Sir Ranulph Fiennes' summiting of the north face of the Eiger in 2007. Phil also reported on Sir Ranulph Fiennes' second failed attempt at summiting Mount Everest in May 2008. In August and September 2008, he reported live from the Arctic Circle where adventurer Lewis Gordon Pugh attempted to become the first person to kayak to the North Pole. His reporting documented how cracks in the ice have made it possible to travel through what used to be permafrost.
In August 2010 Phil left ITN to join the launch team of ITV's new flagship breakfast show Daybreak as consumer editor. He reported on a variety of consumer issues and occasionally joined the main presenting team to discuss the day's newspapers and top stories. However, following the poor ratings performance of the show in its first year on air, a new editorial team was appointed at the end of 2011 and Phil was one of several members of the Daybreak team to be dropped from the show in early 2012.
Media career.
In May 2012, Phil was appointed Head of Media at Ogilvy PR/London - a move he stated as being "a long term career goal".
Reay-Smith is also a freelance writer. He has written for Attitude magazine, The Times, The Telegraph and the Independent on Sunday.
Before working for ITN, Phil was an assistant editor for the Pink Paper.

Henrik Magnus von Buddenbrock

Henrik Magnus von Buddenbrock, (July 22, 1685 – between July 16 and July 27, 1743) was a Swedish baron and Lieutenant General. He and Carl Emil Lewenhaupt were executed for negligence in the Russo-Swedish War, in the aftermath of the defeat at Villmanstrand.
Biography.
He was born on July 22, 1685 in Swedish Livonia. He was the son of the landed gentleman and Swedish Empire army officer Henrik Gotthard von Buddenbrock (1648–1727) and Charlotta Cronman. He enlisted as an officer of the Swedish army, becoming a captain of the Livgardet in 1711, Major of grenadiers in 1715, Major General in 1721. He was elevated to friherre (matricle number 206) in 1731 and promoted to Lieutenant General of the infantry in 1739. As such, he was in 1741 commander of the troops in Finland, under General Charles Emil Lewenhaupt, at the onset of the Russo-Swedish War.
On August 23, 1741 (September 3, 1741), Swedish Major General Carl Henrik Wrangel and his corps in Villmanstrand in Karelia, at the long disputed frontier between Sweden and Russia, was attacked and defeated by a Russian army under General Peter Lacy before Buddenbrock, less than 10 kilometers away, could come to his assiantance.
As the war was developing unfavorably for Sweden, the defeat was blamed on Lewenhaupt and Buddenbrock. In August 1742 they were dismissed from Finland and immediately arrested by Vice Admiral Ritterstolpe upon their return. On the night of September 28 Buddenbrock was brought to Stockholm, where he was imprisoned and closely guarded. A court martial was convened under Field Marshal Hamilton on October 8 to investigate the two cases. The prosecutor was Chancellor of Justice Silverschildt, who submitted an extensive indictment. Buddenbrock was accused of, among other things, not assembling his troops in a timely fashion to cross the Russian border, as planned. In addition he had not arrived at Villmanstrand in time to rescue Major General Wrangel.
Buddenbrock defended himself so well, that had he only faced the nobility, he would have left with his life. However the other Estates of the Riksdag, in particular the peasants, were embittered and demanded a scapegoat. The verdict of the commission was announced to a large congregation on May 29. Buddenbrock was to be dishonored, his property confiscated, and he himself beheaded with an axe. In an appeal, Buddenbrock wrote a comprehensive account where he detailed his services to the kingdom, but despite this and the pleading of his family, the verdict was confirmed by the Estates the following day. Even a request to be beheaded with a sword as befitting a nobleman, or to be executed by firing squad was denied. The date of his execution was set to July 20 but king Frederick postponed it another week. On July 27 1743, General von Buddenbrock was executed in Stockholm. His wife, Magdalena Elisabeth Rahm, and their four children left Sweden for Holland.

Subdivisions of Tanzania

The administrative divisions of Tanzania are controlled by Part I, Article 2.2 of the Constitution of Tanzania. Tanzania is divided into twenty six regions ("mkoa in Swahili"). Each region is subdivided into districts ("wilaya in Swahili"). The districts are sub-divided into divisions and further into local wards. Wards are further subdivided for management purposes: for urban wards into streets ("mitaa in Swahili") and for rural wards into villages ("kijiji in Swahili"). The villages may be further subdivided into hamlets ("vitongoji in Swahili").
Regions.
In 1922 under the British Tanganyika was divided into twenty-two regions, known as "divisions": Arusha, Bagamoyo, Bukoba, Daressalam, Dodoma, Iringa, Kilwa, Kondoa-Irangi, Lindi, Mahenge, Morogoro, Moshi, Mwanza, Pangani, Rufiji, Rungwe, Songea, Tabora, Tanga, Ufipa, Ujiji, and Usambara.
Wards.
A ward or shehia is the lowest government administrative structure at the community level and usually represent between 1,000 to 21,000 people. Rural wards are composed of several communities. Urban wards represent a single town, or a portion of a larger town or city.

<doc id="19260221" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19260221" title="Data Vault Modeling">
Data Vault Modeling

Data Vault Modeling is a database modeling method that is designed to provide long-term historical storage of data coming in from multiple operational systems. It is also a method of looking at historical data that, apart from the modeling aspect, deals with issues such as auditing, tracing of data, loading speed and resilience to change.
Data Vault Modeling focuses on several things. First, it emphasizes the need to trace of where all the data in the database came from. This means that every row in a Data Vault must be accompanied by record source and load date attributes, enabling an auditor to trace values back to the source.
Second, it makes no distinction between good and bad data ("bad" meaning not conforming to business rules). This is summarized in the statement that a Data Vault stores "a single version of the facts" (also expressed by Dan Linstedt as "all the data, all of the time") as opposed to the practice in other data warehouse methods of storing "a single version of the truth" where data that does not conform to the definitions is removed or "cleansed".
Third, the modeling method is designed to be resilient to change in the business environment where the data being stored is coming from, by explicitly separating structural information from descriptive attributes.
Finally, Data Vault is designed to enable parallel loading as much as possible, so that very large implementations can scale out without the need for major redesign.
History and philosophy.
In data warehouse modeling there are two well-known competing options for modeling the layer where the data is stored. Either you model according to Ralph Kimball, with conformed dimensions and an enterprise data bus, or you model according to Bill Inmon with the database normalized. Both techniques have issues when dealing with changes in the systems feeding the data warehouse. For conformed dimensions you also have to cleanse data (to conform it) and this is undesirable in a number of cases since this inevitably will lose information. Data Vault is designed to avoid or minimize the impact of those issues, by moving them to areas of the data warehouse that are outside the historical storage area (cleansing is done in the data marts) and by separating the structural items (business keys and the associations between the business keys) from the descriptive attributes.
Dan Linstedt, the creator of the method, describes the resulting database as follows:
Data Vault's philosophy is that all data is relevant data, even if it is not in line with established definitions and business rules. If data is not conforming to these definitions and rules then that is a problem for the business, not the data warehouse. The determination of data being "wrong" is an interpretation of the data that stems from a particular point of view that may not be valid for everyone, or at every point in time. Therefore the Data Vault must capture all data and only when reporting or extracting data from the Data Vault is the data being interpreted.
Another issue to which Data Vault is a response is that more and more there is a need for complete auditability and traceability of all the data in the datawarehouse. Due to Sarbanes-Oxley in the USA and similar measures in Europe this is a relevant topic for many business intelligence implementations, hence the focus of any Data Vault implementation on complete traceability and auditability of all information.
Data Vault 2.0 is the new specification, but is not an open standard. The new specification contains components which define the implementation best practices, the methodology (SEI/CMMI, Six Sigma, SDLC, etc..), the Architecture, and the model. Data Vault 2.0 has a focus on including new components such as Big Data, NoSQL - and also focuses on performance of the existing model. The old specification (documented here for the most part) is highly focused on Data Vault Modeling.
It is necessary to evolve the specification to include the new components, along with the best practices in order to keep the EDW and BI systems current with the needs and desires of today's businesses.
History.
Data Vault Modeling was originally conceived by Dan Linstedt in 1990 and was released in 2000 as a public domain modeling method. In a series of five articles on The Data Administration Newsletter the basic rules of the Data Vault method are expanded and explained. These contain a general overview, an overview of the components, a discussion about end dates and joins, link tables, and an article on loading practices.
An alternative (and seldom used) name for the method is "Common Foundational Integration Modelling Architecture."
Data Vault 1.0 Specification and certification (CDVDM) is now outdated. It focused highly on *just* Data Vault modeling.
Data Vault 2.0 has arrived on the scene as of 2013 and brings to the table: Big Data, NoSQL, Unstructured, Semi-Structured seamless integration. Along with methodology, architecture, and implementation best practices.
Alternative interpretations.
According to Dan Linstedt, the Data Model is inspired by (or patterned off) a simplistic view of neurons, dendrites, and synapses – where neurons are associated with Hubs and Hub Satellites, Links are dendrites (vectors of information), and other Links are synapses (vectors in the opposite direction). By utilizing a data mining set of algorithms, links can be scored with confidence and strength ratings. They can be created and dropped on the fly in accordance with learning about relationships that currently don't exist. The model can be automatically morphed, adapted, and adjusted as it is used and fed new structures.
Another view is that a Data Vault model provides an ontology of the Enterprise in the sense that it describes the terms in the domain of the enterprise (Hubs) and the relationships among them (Links), adding descriptive attributes (Satellites) where necessary.
Another way to think of a Data Vault Model is as a graph model. The Data Vault model actually provides a "graph based" model with hubs and relationships in a relational database world. In this manner, the developer can use SQL to get at graph based relationships with sub-second responses.
Basic notions.
Data Vault attempts to solve the problem of dealing with change in the environment by separating the business keys (that do not mutate as often, because they uniquely identify a business entity) and the associations between those business keys, from the descriptive attributes of those keys.
The business keys and their associations are structural attributes, forming the skeleton of the data model. The Data Vault method has as one of its main axioms that real business keys only change when the business changes and are therefore the most stable elements from which to derive the structure of a historical database. If you use these keys as the backbone of a Data Warehouse, you can organize the rest of the data around them. This means that choosing the correct keys for the Hubs is of prime importance for the stability of your model. The keys are stored in tables with a few constraints on the structure. These key-tables are called Hubs.
Hubs.
Hubs contain a list of unique business keys with low propensity to change. Hubs also contain a surrogate key for each Hub item and metadata describing the origin of the business key. The descriptive attributes for the information on the Hub (such as the description for the key, possibly in multiple languages) are stored in structures called Satellite tables which will be discussed below.
The Hub contains at least the following fields: 
A Hub is not allowed to contain multiple business keys, except when two systems deliver the same business key but with collisions that have different meanings.
Hubs should normally have at least one satellite.
Hub example.
This is an example for a Hub-table containing Cars, surprisingly called "Car" (H_CAR). The driving key is Vehicle Identification Number.
Links.
Associations or transactions between business keys (relating for instance the Hubs for Customer and Product with each other through the Purchase transaction) are modeled using Link tables. These tables are basically many-to-many join tables, with some metadata.
Links can link to other Links, to deal with changes in granularity (for instance, adding a new key to a database table would change the grain of the database table). For instance, if you have an association between Customer and Address, you could add a reference to a Link between the Hubs for Product and Transport Company. This could be a Link called Delivery. Referencing a Link in another Link is considered a bad practice, because it introduces dependencies between Links that make parallel loading more difficult. Since a Link to another Link is the same as a new Link with the Hubs from the other Link, in these cases a new Link is the preferred solution (see the section on Loading Practices for more information).
Links sometimes link Hubs to information that is not by itself enough to construct a Hub. This occurs when one of the business keys associated by the Link is not a real business key. As an example, take an order form with "order number" as key, and order lines that are keyed with a semi-random number to make them unique. Let's say, "unique number". The latter key is not a real business key, so it is no Hub. However, we do need to use it in order to guarantee the correct granularity for the Link. In this case, we do not use a Hub with surrogate key, but add the business key "unique number" itself to the Link. This is done only when there is no possibility of ever using the business key for another Link or as key for attributes in a Satellite. This construct has been called a 'peg-legged Link' by Dan Linstedt on his (now defunct) forum.
Links contain the surrogate keys for the Hubs that are linked, their own surrogate key for the Link and metadata describing the origin of the association. The descriptive attributes for the information on the association (such as the time, price or amount) are stored in structures called Satellite tables which are discussed below.
Link example.
This is an example for a Link-table between two Hubs for Cars (H_CAR) and Persons (H_PERSON). The Link is called "Driver" (L_DRIVER).
Satellites.
The Hubs and Links form the structure of the model, but have no temporal attributes and hold no descriptive attributes. These are stored in separate tables called Satellites. These consist of metadata linking them to their parent Hub or Link, metadata describing the origin of the association and attributes, as well as a timeline with start and end dates for the attribute. Where the Hubs and Links provide the structure of the model, the Satellites provide the "meat" of the model, the context for the business processes that are captured in Hubs and Links. These attributes are stored both with regards to the details of the matter as well as the timeline and can range from quite complex (all of the fields describing a clients complete profile) to quite simple (a satellite on a Link with only a Valid-indicator and a timeline).
Usually the attributes are grouped in Satellites by source system. However, descriptive attributes such as size, cost, speed, amount or color can change at different rates, so you can also split these attributes up in different Satellites based on their rate of change.
All the tables contain metadata, minimally describing at least the source system and the date on which this entry became valid, giving a complete historical view of the data as it enters the data warehouse.
Satellite example.
This is an example for a satellite on the Drivers-link between the Hubs for Cars and Persons, called Driver Insurance (S_DRIVER_INSURANCE). This Satellite contains attributes that are specific to the insurance of the relationship between the Car and the Person driving it, for instance an indicator whether this is the primary driver, the name of the insurance company for this car and person (could also be a separate Hub) and a summary of the number of accidents involving this combination of vehicle and driver. Also included is a reference to a lookup- or reference table called R_RISK_CATEGORY containing the codes for the risk category in which this relationship is deemed to fall.
(*) at least one attribute is mandatory.
(**) sequence number becomes mandatory if it is needed to enforce uniqueness for multiple valid satellites on the same hub or link.
Reference tables.
Reference tables are a normal part of a healthy Data Vault model. They are there to prevent redundant storage of simple reference data that is referenced a lot. More formally, Dan Linstedt defines reference data as follows:
"Any information deemed necessary to resolve descriptions from codes, or to translate keys in to (sic) a consistent manner. Many of these fields are "descriptive" in nature and describe a specific state of the other more important information. As such, reference data lives in separate tables from the raw Data Vault tables".
Reference tables are referenced from Satellites, but never bound with physical foreign keys. There is no prescribed structure for reference tables: use what works best in your specific case, ranging from simple lookup tables to small Data Vaults or even Stars. They can be historical or have no history, but it is recommended that you stick to the natural keys and not create surrogate keys in that case. Normally, Data Vaults have a lot of reference tables, just like any other Data Warehouse.
Reference example.
This is an example of a reference table with risk categories for drivers of vehicles. It can be referenced from any Satellite in the Data Vault. For now we reference it from Satellite S_DRIVER_INSURANCE. The reference table is R_RISK_CATEGORY.
(*) at least one attribute is mandatory.
Loading practices.
The ETL for updating a Data Vault model is fairly straightforward (see Data Vault Series 5 – Loading Practices). First you have to load all the Hubs, creating surrogate ID's for any new business keys. Having done that, you can now resolve all business keys to surrogate ID's if you query the Hub. The second step is to resolve the Links between Hubs and create surrogate ID's for any new associations. At the same time, you can also create all satellites that are attached to Hubs, since you can resolve the key to a surrogate ID. Once you have created all the new Links with their surrogate keys, you can add the Satellites to all the Links.
Since the Hubs are not joined to each other except through Links, you can load all the Hubs in parallel. Since Links are not attached directly to each other, you can load all the Links in parallel as well. Since Satellites can be attached only to Hubs and Links, you can also load these in parallel.
The ETL is quite straightforward and lends itself to easy automation or templating. Problems occur only with Links relating to other Links, because resolving the business keys in the Link only leads to another Link that has to be resolved as well. Due to the equivalence of this situation with a Link to multiple Hubs, this difficulty can be avoided by remodeling such cases and this is in fact the recommended practice.
Data is never deleted from the Data Vault, unless you have a technical error while loading data.
Data Vault and dimensional modelling.
The Data Vault modelled layer is normally used to store data. It is not optimized for query performance, nor is it easy to query by the well-known query-tools such as Cognos, SAP Business Objects, Pentaho et al. Since these end-user computing tools expect or prefer their data to be contained in a dimensional model, a conversion is usually necessary.
For this purpose, the Hubs and related Satellites on those Hubs can be considered as Dimensions and the Links and related Satellites on those Links can be viewed as Fact tables in a dimensional model. This enables you to quickly prototype a dimensional model out of a Data Vault model using views. For performance reasons the dimensional model will usually be implemented in relational tables, after approval.
Note that while it is relatively straightforward to move data from a Data Vault model to a (cleansed) dimensional model, the reverse is not as easy.
Data Vault Methodology.
The Data Vault methodology is based on SEI/CMMI Level 5 best practices. It includes multiple components of CMMI Level 5, and combines them with best practices from Six Sigma, TQM, and SDLC. Particularly, it is focused on Scott Ambler's Agile Methodology for build out and deployment. Data Vault projects have a short, scope controlled release cycle and should consist of a production release every 2 to 3 weeks.
Teams using the Data Vault methodology will automatically adopt to the repeatable, consistent, and measurable projects that are expected at CMMI Level 5. Data that flows through the EDW Data Vault system will begin to follow the TQM (total quality management) life-cycle that has long been missing from BI (business intelligence) projects.
Tools.
Due to the recurring structure of the DataVault with only three types of tables, as well as the separation of structural and descriptive attributes, automation is relatively straightforward. Nowadays, there are several tools supporting Data Vault with wildly varying types of support. 
Some of the more notable tools include:

Kharma International

Kharma International B.V., usually known as Kharma, is a High-end audio equipment manufacturer producing mainly loudspeakers and cables.
History.
The company was founded Oosterum Loudspeaker Systems (O.L.S. Audiotechnology) in 1982 by Charles van Oosterum. 
In 1984 Kharma was the first company to use ceramic material as membrane in their driver units.
After starting international promotion at the C.E.S. in 1997 the brand got several important awards and expanded sales from the Netherlands to the United States and the Far East.
¬O.L.S. Audio – Oosterum Loudspeaker Systems
In 1982 Charles van Oosterum founded O.L.S. Audio, also known as Oosterum Loudspeaker Systems. Charles founded O.L.S. while he was still studying electronics and in particular electromagnetics and electromechanics at the University of Eindhoven. Although Charles began with no other goal than to finance his experiments with different designs and driver concepts, word of his talent spread and he was soon sought by individuals and other companies for his design skills. By 1984 O.L.S. was a successful manufacturer of systems for consumer and professional use. That same year Charles introduced the now familiar concept of Satellite subwoofer speakers systems to Holland, which made O.L.S. the first company to do so. 
During the years O.L.S. was expanding and in 1992, one of the best known audiophiles invited Charles to listen to some music on his existing system. After many hours of listening, this gentlemen turned to his guest with a challenge.. although his existing system was good, he wanted something perfect. It just so happened that Charles had a computer design of a system that was “in the works”, but when asked about it Charles had to explain that it only existed on disk. Intrigued, the gentlemen commissioned him to build the system, with one important provision: if he liked it, he would pay for it, if not hoe wouldn’t. Undaunted, Charles went ahead and built what was to become the Grand Enigma System – one of the largest and most exclusive high-end consumer loudspeakers ever made. 
This 12 ton system is fully active with 30kW of amplification, equipped with 24 ultrahigh efficiency planar-magnetic HF-units, 24 15-inch LF drivers and 48 6-inch MF drivers. Placed in a specially prepared subterranean listening room of 45,000 cubic feet it presents sound with incredible dynamics and limitless power, easily reproducing live concert levels at a distance of 10meters. Needless to say, Charles was paid well for his work and the gentlemen was very satisfied. 
After this O.L.S. has gained a reputation for affordable high performance speakers, and spurred on by his success with the Grand Enigma System, Charles launched a new high-end brand in 1993, named Kharma. In 1998 Kharma developed their first speakers, which were the Divine series. The Divine series met enough success which made Kharma introduce other series. In 1998 Kharma also introduced the Ceramique line and introduced three different types. The Ceramique 1.0, Ceramique 2.0 and the Ceramique 3.0. That same year Kharma had several reviews by Soundstage and held several shows in the United States, including San Francisco Hi-Fi’97 Standout Rooms, a launch of the Exquisite Reference 1A during the C.E.S. in Las Vegas and the Hi-Fi’99 show in Los Angeles. In upcoming years Charles visited the United States more often for shows, including the Hi-Fi’99 in Chicago and the C.E.S. 2000 in Las Vegas. 
When 2000 came, Kharma upgraded the Ceramique lines to the Ceramique 1.1, Ceramique 2.1. and the Ceramique 3.1. After the upgraded versions Kharma introduced the Diamond Tweeter in 2001, increasing the sound performance in a whole different dimension. 
This made Kharma upgrade their Ceramique lines, which resulted in 2002 in new product launches of the Ceramique 1.2, Ceramique 2.3 and the Ceramique 3.2 and the change within the Exquisite series, changing the Exquisite 1C to the Exquisite 1D. 
These upgraded versions of the Ceramique were very popular among customers, companies but also reviewers, which rewarded Kharma with a Golden Ear Award and The Absolute Sound Award for Upper End Loudspeaker in 2002 both for the Ceramique 3.2. Triggered by these developments, Kharma introduced another change in the Exquisite in 2003, the Exquisite 1D becoming the Exquisite 1E, and in 2003 the Ceramique 3.2 won another Golden Ear Award, together with an Absolute Sound Award Golden Ear Award for the Enigma Cables Kharma couldn’t be more proud. 
Charles still kept on designing and his enthusiasm was raised even more, which made him launch 4 new products in 2003. The Grand Ceramique, the Grand Ceramique Midi and the Exquisite Mini and Exquisite Midi. In 2003 Kharma’s Grand Ceramique Speakers received the Positive Feedback Speaker of the Year Brutus Award by Editor David Robinson and in 2004 the Ceramique Sub won the Golden Ear Award, followed up by the Golden Ear Award in 2005 for the Exquisite Midi 1A. Also for these lines there were several reviews written. 
In 2005 Kharma introduced a whole new product line, named the Matrix, and the first product to be launched was the Matrix MP150. All these successes caused the renaming of O.L.S. Audiotechnology into Kharma International in 2006. 
As Kharma International Charles attended the High End Show 2006 in Munich with a new product launch, the Grand Exquisite, which caused the writing of several reviews on the Exquisite lines by 6moons and Possitive-feedback.com. Another introduction was made in 2006, which was the Signature wiring in Cables and Loudspeakers.
Charles was still very busy with designing new models and improving the already existing product lines within Kharma, expanding his own knowledge and gathering new technologies. His designers energy created an expansion of the Exquisite line in 2007, the Exquisite Mini Galileo and the expansion of the Ceramique, with the Ceramique 3.2.2. In 2007 the Matrix MP150 got his first Award, the Blue Moon Award. 
At the end of 2007 Kharma had his 25th anniversary and held a luxurious party at the headquarters in Breda. 
After receiving the Blue Moon Award for the Matrix MP150, Charles thought it was time to expand the Matrix line, and he did so with the launch in 2008 with the Matrix P1.0. However his designs didn’t stop there, and in 2009 and 2010 Kharma introduced the Exquisite MP1000 Power Amplifier and the P1000 Exquisite pre-amplifier, which eventually got a full upgrade in 2012 that ran a world-premiere at T.H.E. Show in Las Vegas. But before 2012 arrived, Kharma introduced a whole new product line called the Elegance line in 2010. This new line is representing the latest technologies developed by Kharma and in 2012 got equipped with the new Kharma Omega-7 driver, which is based on a new cone technology especially developed for Kharma. 
The vision of the CEO of Kharma - Charles van Oosterum.
“Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Just like a genuine piece of art, a painting, a sculpture can evoke the special feeling of true beauty in the eyes of the beholder. So, not in everyone, just in the one that already has realized this beauty in her/himself and is ready for the next step.
This is how we see a Kharma product, evoking feelings of beauty, deep emotions, by offering a time window to the artistic performance. The subtle vibrations that a Kharma music system offers are capable of stirring up these deep personal emotions.
This has to be experienced to be believed. Just as it is not possible to describe the taste of a strawberry to someone, who has never eaten a strawberry in his life. Don’t take these words for granted experience for yourself; Let go, Indulge and Enjoy an endless journey beyond imagination” "Charles van Oosterum, CEO of Kharma." 
Products by Kharma.
- Exquisite series
There are several Exquisite models designed and developed by Kharma, with each their own characteristics and appearance. However, all Exquisite models have several things in common. The far-reaching attention to detail makes this speaker range a class of its own. This is especially stressed by the Diamond cone of the tweeter, which is one of so many high-lights that are standard in the Kharma Exquisite Collection. The systems are developed, assembled and tested in the Netherlands, with the utmost care, by a team of highly dedicated, committed specialists. 
The Exquisite series include: 
AV Loudspeakers:
Electronics:
- Elegance series
The Elegance collection is succeeding the very successful Ceramique line of high-end loudspeakers from Kharma. The Ceramique loudspeaker line was introduced in 1998 and the use of Ceramique-based drivers was the reason for naming this series like we did.
During the past years Kharma has been researching new technologies as how to improve and set a new standard again to the high-end audio world. We are very proud now to offer the very latest high-tech technologies again in the new Elegance series. The shape of the cabinets has been unchanged because the shape is fully functional to the way the sound develops from the loudspeakers. But the beauty of the design has been improved upon, by redesigning the stand and bottom, the redesign of the front cover and many other small design details. 
The Elegance Series include:
AV Loudspeakers: 
- Matrix series
The Matrix is the new paradigm in sound-architecture. This speaker anticipates on the request for a high-end Home Cinema speaker system in a revolutionary way. The main point for this design was to use the possibility to aim sound. Several studies have been done on how to create a system that could fill up any room with high-end sound.
This resulted in a hanging speaker almost completely made out of aluminum. Its direction can be adjusted by rotation over a vertical and over a horizontal axis.
The Matrix series include:
AV Loudspeakers:
Electronics:
- Cable series
Kharma has also specialised itself in the development of ultra-high-end Cables. Therefore they have developed several different series, with all their own characteristics and appearance. 
Cable series:
All Cable series include the following items: Loudspeaker cables, Interconnect cables, Power cables and Power blocks. 
- Kharma projects
Besides the high-end loudspeakers, Kharma is also very interested in developing different projects including audio and luxury. Over the past few years Kharma has developed several different projects to uplift the high-end, to a luxurious level. 
The several projects Kharma provides are:

Kirk Dawes

Kirk Dawes QPM (born c. 1957) is a former Detective Constable with West Midlands Police who now runs The Centre For Conflict Transformation (TCFCT) formerly West Midlands Mediation and Transformation Services, a company involved in trying to reduce gun and gang violence in the United Kingdom.
Early life and police career.
Born in Wolverhampton, one of six surviving children of Caribbean immigrants. An early memory is of moving to a new house in a council estate in Bilston where most residents had signed a petition against black families moving in. Educated at Willenhall Comprehensive School he then joined West Midlands Police in 1976. After three years as an ordinary constable in Willenhall and Walsall, he moved into specialist units, initially the robbery squard from 1979 until 1981, then the special patrol group, then from 1985 the drugs squad, before joining Sutton Coldfield and Castle Vale CID in 1989 as a Detective Constable. After the publication of the Macpherson report in 1995 he moved into training other CID officers in racial diversity issues. In 1998 he became the regional chairman of the Black and Asian Police Association. A lung condition curtailed his police career in 2004, and on 12 June 2004 he was awarded the Queen's Police Medal (QPM) in the Queen's Birthday Honours.
Mediation.
After leaving the police he set up his company which mediates between principally Birmingham's gangs and others across the UK, and also tries to disengage youths from gang culture. His lung complaint also reduced his involvement in basketball, he played for the British police team and coached national league sides, and still uses basketball in his mediation work. He is also on the board of Birmingham Royal Ballet.
The work of Dawes and the WMMTS is regularly reported in the British media; he was a "witness" interviewed by the "Street Weapons Commission" organised by Channel 4 and chaired by Cherie Booth which in 2008 investigated youth violence in the United Kingdom; he has also appeared as a witness before the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee; and he is a regular conference speaker.

Annery kiln

Annery kiln is a former limekiln of the estate of Annery, in the parish of Monkleigh, North Devon. It is situated on the left bank of the River Torridge near Half-Penny Bridge, built in 1835, which connects the parishes of Monkleigh and Weare Giffard. Running by it today is A386 road from Bideford to Great Torrington. Weare Giffard is the start of the tidal section of the River Torridge, and thus the kiln was sited here to import by river raw materials for the kiln, the product of which was lime fertiliser for use on inland agricultural fields. The old lime kiln is thus situated between the River Torridge and the now filled-in Rolle Canal built "circa" 1827 and railway that ran formerly from Bideford to Torrington, opened in 1872 and closed in 1966. The old trackbed now forms a stretch of the Tarka Trail. 
The history of Annery limekiln.
Weare Giffard is situated near the tidal limit of the River Torridge, and coal and limestone had been brought up-stream by boat for a long time previously to the building of the Rolle Canal in 1823 - 1827. Due to the corrosive properties of quick lime, the product of the kiln, it was essential that kilns should be situated as closely as possible to the agricultural fields on which it was to be spread. Should the quick lime become wet during transport by the farmer to his farm, it would corrode its container and damage the wagon or pack-animal on which it was being transported. Culm, a form of imperfect anthracite, was mined in Devon at Tavistock and Chittlehampton as well as being imported from South Wales via Bideford. The limestone largely came from Caldey Island off the South Wales coast, although Devon had quarries at Landkey, Swimbridge, Filleigh, South Molton and Combe Martin.
The lime kiln complex comprised the kiln itself, a pond for slaking the calcium oxide from the kiln to produce the slaked lime, hydrated lime, or pickling lime. Several cottages were built nearby for the lime-burners, shipbuilders and blacksmiths, etc. and storage buildings. The main set of cottages are neither evidenced on any maps nor in census returns until after 1851, indicating that they were not built until later and only one census return in the 19th century lists a lime-kiln worker. A small wharf on the river allowed for the unloading of sailing barges.
Annery limekiln has a ramp facing the river, three kilns (or burning 'pots'), seven entrance doorways and nine lower apertures for the removal of the calcined limestone. The arrangement of the kilns gives an L-shaped compact structure. Some of the entrances led to arched lobbies or 'eyes', at the back of which were the grates and separate 'poking holes' to insert metals rods for 'working' the charge and helping with aeration. A 'lean-to' slated roof may have slotted beneath part of the drip course of projecting stones, which runs around the exterior walls of the kiln. The arched entrances to the kiln allowed for the sheltered and safe collection of the quicklime, which reacted violently to water.
The top of the kilns was flat and large enough to allow for some storage of culm and limestone. Like Lord Rolle's kilns at Rosemore, Great Torrington and his nearby Town Mills they were at a late date crenellated with castle-like battlements, an eccentric decorative feature probably added by John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (d.1842), of Stevenstone, lord of the manor of Great Torrington, builder of the Rolle Canal and partner in the building of Half-Penny Bridge with Mr Tardrew of Annery. Town Mills were crenellated to form an "eye-catcher" when viewed up the picturesque Torridge valley from Castle Hill, Great Torrington, which Lord Rolle had also castellated to recall the ancient castle. The original Annery kiln had been built prior to Lord Rolles's canal and the Great Torrington lime kilns; it is unlikely to have had the crenellations.
Annery was well built, with local mortar-cemented stones, a rubble infill and firebricks lining the kilns' combustion chambers. The various openings to the kilns have rounded or pointed Gothic arches formed from bricks. The now lost crenellated 'battlements' construction was similar to other kilns such as those at Yeo Vale on the Torridge, south-west of Bideford and those at Torrington.
Evidence suggests that the original kiln had a single pot and arched entrances leading to three 'eyes', and that later two more pots were built with rounded tops to the arches which led to only two eyes each. The decorative front of the new kiln has blind arches at either end and two quatrefoils, symmetrical shapes which form the overall outline of four partially overlapping circles of the same diameter.
The kiln had excellent communications, originally being sited simply next to the river, but gaining later the additions of the canal, the road between Bideford and Torrington, as well as the new Half-Penny toll-bridge across the Torridge to Weare Giffard, built in 1835 by Lord Rolle and Mr Tardrew. In Devon the demand for agricultural lime in the 19th century was very high, and farmers from a wide area collected loads of lime from Annery, by pack-horse at first and later using wagons, They arrived sometimes as early as 4am to ensure a supply for the day.
The development of the rail network made local small-scale kilns generally unprofitable, but Annery had closed in around 1864, before the local railway was opened. Local competition from the lime kilns at Torrington and elsewhere would have been intense.

Limekilns.
Function.
Annery had three burning chambers constructed of brick, each with an air inlet (the "eye") at the base. Crushed limestone and coal unloaded from a boat on the nearby tidal River Torridge or possibly the Rolle Canal, were hauled up the single ramp and emptied into the kiln chamber. Successive dome-shaped layers of culm coal and limestone would have been built up in the kiln on grate bars across the eye at the base. When loading or 'charging' was completed, the kiln would have been kindled at the bottom, and the fire gradually allowed to spread upwards through the charge. When burnt through, the lime was cooled and raked out through the base.
The size of kilns was limited by the need to allow air to permeate freely and to prevent a collapse from too much weight; this explains why individual kilns were all much the same size and therefore multiple kilns— three at Annery— were necessary to increase production. Each kiln usually made between 25 and 30 tonnes of lime in a batch; at Annery they may have been fired in rotation to ensure a continuous supply.
Typically each kiln took around a day to load, three days to fire, two days to cool and a day to unload. The degree of burning was controlled by trial and error from batch to batch by varying the amount of fuel used. There were large temperature differences between the center of a charge and the material close to the wall, so a mixture of under-burned, well-burned and dead-burned lime was normally produced. Typical fuel efficiency was low and the job was labour-intensive, with a loading gang and an unloading gang who would work the kilns in rotation through the week. The heat was intense and the smoke considerable, making this a very dangerous occupation.
Lime and its uses.
Lime kilns are used to produce Calcium oxide or quicklime by calcinating limestone. The reaction involved takes place at around 900°C, but a temperature around 1000°C is usually used to make the reaction proceed more quickly. Excessive temperature is avoided because it produces unreactive or "dead-burned" lime.
Lime is used in building as a mortars and also as a stabilizer in mud renders and floors. Lime is much used in agriculture, but it only became widely possible when the use of coal made it cheaper.
Land transportation of bulky minerals like limestone and coal was difficult in the pre-industrial era due to the poor condition of the roads, so they were distributed by sea; the lime most often being manufactured at small coastal ports and then taken inland by carts. Many of the surviving kilns are still to be seen on quaysides around the coastline of the United Kingdom.
History of Annery and Weare Giffard.
Annery is a nearby former historic estate. Old maps show that a country house of that name existed there in the 18th century. Another lime kiln existed opposite Weare Giffard and the name was either used to distinguish the two or Annery may have been the manorial kiln which supplied the tenants.
During a visit to Annery Kiln in 1971 one of the old cottages had a chimney fire. The householder sorted the problem out by firing both barrels of a 12 bore shotgun up the offending chimney, extinguishing the fire whilst at the same time 'cleaning the chimney!'
In the 1970s the kiln was used as a garage and store (see photographs) and was a community in its own right, known as Annery Kiln.
The small shipyard that had existed at Annery was moved down to the sea lock when the canal was built.
William Tardrew of Annery was a share holder in the Rolle Canal Company and held lands along the length of the canal.
Adjacent to the Annery kiln is Brick Marsh, which was the site of the Devon or Annery Pottery.
The name of the village is variously written as Weare 'Giffard' or 'Gifford,' the former being more frequently used. The Giffard family are recorded as having been in the area since at least the year 1219. Annery was first recorded as 'Auri' in 1193.
The Beam Aqueduct (see illustration) has long been used as a road bridge to a private house and below it were filmed several pivotal scenes for the Tarka the Otter film.

Nicholas Plunkett

Sir Nicholas Plunkett (1602–1680) was the son of Christopher Plunkett, 9th Baron Killeen and Jane (or Genet) Dillon, daughter of Sir Lucas Dillon. His brother Luke was created Earl of Fingall in 1628. At the age of twenty Plunkett traveled to London to receive training as a lawyer at Gray's Inn in London, and later trained at King's Inn in Dublin. By the 1630s he had established a thriving legal practice: the attempts by Thomas Wentworth, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, to confiscate as much Irish land as possible to the Crown, ensured that his services were in high demand. At this time he also became an MP in the Irish House of Commons, sitting for Meath.
At the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Plunkett attempted to remain neutral. However, in mid-1642 government troops looted and torched his home in Balrath, County Meath: Plunkett unsurprisingly thereafter gave support to the leaders of the Irish Insurgents. He played a prominent role in the foundation of the Confederation of Kilkenny, sitting as chairman at the first meeting of the Confederate Assembly and was also a member of the Confederate Supreme Council (one of six members representing the province of Leinster). Plunkett was also appointed Muster-Master general.
In 1644 Plunkett was a member of a Confederate delegation sent to negotiate a treaty with King Charles I. The first Ormond Peace was eventually arranged in 1646, but despite Plunkett's efforts the Catholic Clergy of Ireland rejected the treaty.
Plunkett was a deeply religious man, who impressed the Papal Nuncio, Rinuccini after his arrival in Ireland in late 1645. Even so, Plunkett was a moderate by disposition, and he thus became a leader of the moderate Confederate faction, attempting in 1647 to reconcile the supporters of Ormond and those of Rinuccini. In 1648 he once again took part in a Confederate delegation, this time to Rome, in an attempt to gain further Papal support. The Pope made Plunkett a knight of the Golden Spur, but the mission to Rome was largely a failure.
While he was in Rome a Civil War broke out in the Confederation over the Inchiquin truce of 1648. When Plunklett returned, the clerical faction of the Confederates had lost influence, and so Plunkett became involved in negotiations for a second Ormond Peace, eventually signed in early 1649. 
Only six months later the New Model Army launched a full-scale invasion of Ireland, and within a year had conquered large areas of the island. Nicholas' nephew Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall was killed at the Battle of Rathmines. Ulick Burke, 1st Marquess of Clanricarde was appointed leader of the Irish forces in late 1650, replacing the discredited Earl of Ormond. In 1651 Clanricarde sent Plunkett with Geoffrey Browne on a desperate mission to negotiate with Charles IV, the extremely wealthy Duke of Lorraine, but the mission to gain his support was not successful.
After the conquest of Ireland Plunkett had his lands confiscated and was transported to Connacht. His luck changed at the Restoration in 1660, however: the endless disputes between the dispossessed Irish landholders and the planters enabled him to restore his legal practice to its former esteem. 
He married Catherine Turner, daughter of William Turner, an Alderman of Dublin; their daughter Jane married Valentine Browne, 1st Viscount Kenmare.
Nicholas Plunkett's brother, Patrick, was also prominent in Confederate politics, becoming Bishop of Ardagh in 1647 largely thanks to the backing of Rinuccini.

Whitney Darrow, Jr. (August 22, 1909 – August 10, 1999) was a prominent American cartoonist, who worked most of his career for "The New Yorker", with some 1,500 of his cartoons printed in his nearly 50-year-long career with the magazine.
Darrow was born in Princeton, New Jersey, where his father Whitney Darrow was founding director of Princeton University Press. Darrow grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut, where he attended Greenwich High School. He graduated in 1931 from Princeton University, where he wrote humor for the "Daily Princetonian" and was art director for the "Princeton Tiger Magazine". He honed his craft at Art Students League of New York with instructors including painter Thomas Hart Benton. In his early 20s began selling cartoons to "Judge", "Life" and "College Humor". As a 24-year-old in 1933, he sold his first cartoon to "The New Yorker", while the magazine, which had been founded in 1925, was still in its infancy. This first cartoon depicted three nudists, two women observing a man, with one woman telling the other, "Last night I saw him in a blue serge suit. Zowie!"
The humor in Darrow's cartoons often focused on the absurdities and behavioral contradictions of middle-class suburban life, and featured characters such as judges, windbags, individuals in varying states of drunkenness, children and art. A classic Darrow depicts a group of small schoolchildren observing Édouard Manet's Le déjeuner sur l'herbe (The Luncheon on the Grass), depicting a female nude with two fully dressed men, being told in explanation by their adult guide that "Well, it was sort of like a cook-out." He published four collections of his cartoons, "You're Sitting on My Eyelashes," "Give Up?", "Stop, Miss" and "Please Pass the Hostess." He illustrated children's books and other books written by such authors as Nathaniel Benchley, Jean Kerr and Johnny Carson.
A master draftsman who (unlike most of his colleagues) wrote his own captions, Darrow was among the last of the New Yorker's early cartoonists, joining Charles Addams, Peter Arno, George Price and James Thurber. Darrow retired from the magazine in 1982.
Darrow died in Burlington, Vermont. He and his wife Mildred lived in Shelburne, Vermont.

Sylvanus T. Rugg

Sylvanus Tunning Rugg (1834 – May 4, 1881) was an officer in the Union Army who commanded an artillery battery at the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War, as well as in other leading battles of the Army of the Potomac. He also served in the Western Theater late in his career.
Biography.
Rugg was born in Taunton, Massachusetts in 1834. Early in the war, he became a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U. S. Artillery, a promotion dated October 22, 1862. He received permanent promotion to that rank in the 4th U. S. Artillery on the same date. There is no record of Rugg's having attended a military school, suggesting he was promoted from the ranks.
Rugg commanded Battery F, 4th U.S. Artillery in the artillery brigade of the XII Corps at Gettysburg. Lt. Edward D. Muhlenberg, who had commanded the battery, was in charge of the brigade by seniority. Battery F reached Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, and advanced to a position near the Hanover Road to support the advance of the 1st Division under Brig. Gen. Alpheus S. Williams to Benner's Hill. The battery arrived with 120 men and 6 Napoleons, 12-pounder smoothbore guns; see Field artillery in the American Civil War. On July 2 it covered a gap in the Union lines, but on July 3 it was posted near the Baltimore Pike to bombard the portion of Culp's Hill the Confederates had captured on the previous day. It participated in a bombardment of the Confederates that helped drive them from their advanced position. One man was wounded by an artillery round from the bombardment preceding Pickett's Charge that flew over the Union lines on Cemetery Ridge. The battery’s monument stands at the intersection of Hunt Avenue and the Baltimore Pike on the battlefield.
Rugg continued to serve in the Union army through the autumn 1863 campaigns in Tennessee when the XII Corps was reassigned to the Western Theater. He was dismissed from the service on July 22, 1864.
Rugg died of Bright's disease on May 4, 1881, at Cottage Hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was buried at the Minneapolis Pioneers and Soldiers Memorial Cemetery.

Advance Concrete

Advance Concrete is a computer-aided design (CAD) software application was developed by GRAITEC, but is now an Autodesk product, used for modeling and detailing reinforced concrete structures. Advance Concrete is used in the structural / civil engineering and drafting fields.
Features.
Advance Concrete is specifically designed for engineers and structural draftsmen looking for comprehensive and easy to use software, including its own graphics engine allowing it to run with or without AutoCAD.
The application can be used for modeling and detailing different types of concrete structures, such as buildings, precast concrete elements, and also for civil engineering designs.
Advance Concrete uses AutoCAD technology: ObjectARX. This technology provides users with professional objects (beams, columns, slabs, bars, frames, stirrup bars) integrated into AutoCAD and on which most basic AutoCAD functions can be applied (stretch, shorten, copy, move). The Advance Concrete native file is the DWG file.
The main functions of Advance Concrete concern:
The program provides a working environment for creating 3D structural models from which drawings are created. The 3D model is created using Advance Concrete specific objects (structural elements, openings, rebars, etc.) and stored in a drawing (in DWG format). Once a model is complete, Advance Concrete creates all structural and reinforcement drawings using a large selection of tools for view creation, dimensions, interactive annotations, symbols, markings and automatic layout functions. Advance Concrete provides functionalities for automatic drawing updates based on model modifications.
Specific functionalities.
One of the features of Advance Concrete is the “dynamic reinforcement” technology for the rapid reinforcement of concrete elements taking into account their context (type, parameters, connection with other elements).
The user creates a so-called dynamic reinforcement solution that integrates the reinforcement cage elements and properties: geometric information, local rules and standards for steel grade, reinforcement bar placement, concrete cover, etc. The reinforcement solutions can be used later for elements that have different sizes. The reinforcement elements adjust to the new dimensions and are taken into account at reinforcement drawing creation and lists.
The user can save the reinforcement solution in an external file, which can be exchanged, downloaded, reused in any other projects etc.
Software compatibility.
The application is compatible with the following operating systems and Autodesk platforms: 
Software interoperability.
Advance Concrete integrates GRAITEC’s “GTC” (GRAITEC Transfer Center) technology, a data synchronization technology that allows:
GTC is the GRAITEC solution for CAD/Design software interoperability and integration specialized in creating and handling a BIM (Building Information Model).

USS Pipestone (AK-203)

USS "Pipestone" (AK-203) was an "Alamosa"-class cargo ship that was constructed for the U.S. Navy during the closing period of World War II. By the time she was scheduled for commissioning, the war’s end caused her to be declared “excess to needs” and she was returned to the U.S. Government and struck by the Navy.
Career.
"Pipestone" (AK–203) was laid down under U.S. Maritime Commission contract by Globe Shipbuilding Co., Superior, Wisconsin. She was transferred to the Navy in April 1945. "Pipestone" was scheduled for commissioning. However, because of the Allied victory in the Pacific Ocean theatre of operations, her commissioning was delayed. "Pipestone" was ordered returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission for disposal. She was subsequently renamed "Coastal Explorer". Her subsequent fate is not known.

Cairo and Vincennes Railroad

The Cairo and Vincennes Railroad was a 19th-century American railroad that connected Cairo, Illinois, with Vincennes, Indiana. It was chartered by the state of Illinois in 1867 through the efforts of former American Civil War General Green B. Raum, who subsequently oversaw the planning and engineering of the proposed line. Within a few years, the fledgling railroad company named another former general, Ambrose Burnside, as its president. The Cairo & Vincennes began laying track in 1870 and completed the initial portion in 1872 to haul coal from southern Illinois mines. However, the route was not fully completed until late in 1874.
In January 1874, the railroad was teetering on bankruptcy and the contractors, the firm of Winslow & Wilson, applied for control. In February, a new board of directors assumed control of the railroad and named industrialist J. P. Morgan as the new president, replacing Burnside. In April, the C&V formally went into receivership. The next month, receivers H. L. Morrill and A. B. Salford took possession of the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad.
The line was reorganized into the Cairo and Vincennes Railway in 1880, which in turn became part of the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway in 1881, but was resold to the Cairo, Vincennes and Chicago Railway at the Wabash's foreclosure in 1889. The CV&C became part of the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (Big Four) system, which itself became part of the New York Central Railroad system in 1906. Much of the original route of the C&V remains in usage for freight hauling. Part, in Illinois, has been rededicated as the Tunnel Hill State Trail.

Cyrus Byington

Cyrus Byington was a White Christian missionary from Massachusetts who worked with the Choctaw in Mississippi and later in Indian Territory, later called Oklahoma, during 19th century. He set out to construct a lexicon of the Choctaw language in order to translate Christian prayers, hymns, and bible passages. Byington's work is considered one of the most complete lexicons for a Native American language. He worked for nearly fifty years translating Choctaw as a written language.
Byington's work.
The Choctaw language is a member of the Muskogean family and was well known among the frontiersmen, such as U.S. President Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison, of the early 19th century. The language is closely related to Chickasaw and some linguists consider the two dialects a single language. The following table is an example of Choctaw text and its translation:
Orthography.
The written Choctaw language is based upon English version of the Roman alphabet and was developed in conjunction with the civilization program of the United States in the early 19th century. Byington's alphabet and a version modified by John Swanton is seen here.

Glastonbury Festival 2009

The 2009 Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts was held from 24–29 June 2009.
Tickets.
Registration.
In a similar way to previous festivals, tickets for the 2009 event required pre-registration (of a photograph and personal details) through the festival website. Registration opened on 1 September 2008.
Sales.
Tickets were able to be purchased via the See Tickets website or by telephone. A limited number of tickets were available by promotion through the "Western Daily Press" and competitions run by Greenpeace, eFestivals and The Guardian.
Ticket lines opened on the morning of 5 October 2008, and customers were able to place deposits for tickets (£50) or buy them in full (£175). Tickets required full payment by 1 February 2009.
On 22 January 2009, at Midem 2009, Michael Eavis announced that 90% of the event's 137,500 tickets had been sold. He also stated that although headliners had not been confirmed, he was awaiting confirmation from the acts he had approached.
Re-sale.
Reserved tickets which did not have their remaining balance paid by the deadline were put back on sale on 2 February 2009 and it was announced the next day that the event had sold out, with the majority of reservations being balanced by 1 February deadline. A re-sale of cancelled tickets was held on 5 April 2009 at 9:00 am. These tickets sold out by 10:15 am.
Site.
Arenas.
In a December 2008 interview, co-organiser Emily Eavis stated that the "Trash City" arena would be expanded for the 2009 festival. On 5 December 2008, Battersea and Wandsworth TUC announced that the "Left Field" tent of the site would not be a part of the 2009 event. A new area, named "William's Green", occupied the same area.
The 2009 event saw expansion of the "Dance Village" – including a 3D disco – as well as the return of the "G-Stage" and the "Pussy Parlure". Greenpeace used their area in the Green Fields to create an airport terminal building and miniature replica of the village of Sipson, which is threatened by the expansion of London Heathrow Airport.
Camping.
As with previous events, the festival had a tipi field where six people can accommodate one tipi for the shared price of £800.
A new hospitality area, surrounded by a wall, was created on the old cinema field between Lower Mead and Wicker Ground fields. This area included PodPad camping. 
The positioning of this area restricted pedestrian access to both camping and parking sites; pathways at previous festivals have led through this area.
Line up.
The three main headline acts (Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band and Blur) were announced in March 2009, with the full line up being released on 25 May 2009.
Impact of Michael Jackson's death.
The news of Michael Jackson's death spread unconfirmed during the night of 25 June, with DJs and bars playing his tracks during the night. Various tributes were made to him by performers throughout 26 June, including Dizzee Rascal leading a crowd rendition of Jackson's hit "Thriller", and N.E.R.D frontman Pharrell Williams paying respects for Jackson in saying "It's the music, the music was so incredible", before adding that Jackson "changed music and the way people looked at music." Other performers to pay tribute to Jackson included The Streets, Hugh Cornwell, Lily Allen, Dan Le Sac Vs Scroobius Pip and Gabriella Cilmi. Within hours of his death, there were t-shirts for sale proclaiming ""I was at Glasto 09 when Jacko died"" 
and shops announcing ""Michael Jackson has died, 10% off everything.""
Swine flu at Glastonbury 2009.
Several cases of swine flu were reported during the festival. Two of these were students and one a 10 year old child. The three infected festival-goers were isolated when symptoms presented and no further cases have been reported. Festival organisers had reportedly anticipated some cases of the virus with a spokesperson saying "...the figure of three in 177,000 people is regarded as very low."

Kiev Missal

The Kiev Missal (or Kiev Fragments or Kiev Folios; scholarly abbreviation Ki) is a seven-folio Glagolitic Old Church Slavonic canon manuscript containing parts of the Roman-rite liturgy. It is usually held to be the oldest and the most archaic Old Church Slavonic manuscript, and is dated at no later than the latter half of the 10th century. Seven parchment folios have been preserved in small format (cca 14,5x10,5 cm) of easily portable book to be of use to missionaries on the move.
Discovery and publishing.
Kiev Folios have been found in the 19th century in Jerusalem by the Archimandrite Andrej Kapustin (Antonin Kapustin) who donated them the Kiev Theological Academy. After the revolution the folios were transferred to the library of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Kiev where they are being kept today.
Izmail Sreznevsky made the manuscript known to the public, editing the first edition of Kiev Folios in 1874. They have been republished many times since, though not always successfully. Notable editions are by Vatroslav Jagić in 1890 ("Glagolitica. 2. Würdigung neuendtdeckter Fragmente, Mit 10 Taf.", Wien 1890, Denkschrift. Kaiserl. Akad., Bd. 38), by Sievers in 1924 ("Die altslavischen Verstexte von Kiew und Freising", Leipzig 1924, Akad. Wiss., phil.-hist. Kl., Bd. 76/2) and by Mohlberg in 1928 ("Il messale di Kiew/sec IX./ed il suo prototipo Romano del VI-VII"). Special attention to the Kiev folios has been paid by Václav Vondrák in a paper "O původu Kijevských listů a Pražských zlomků a o bohemismech v starších církevněslovanských památkách vůbec" (Praha, 1904). The newest facsimile edition has been published in 1983 in Kiev to honor the ninth International Congress of Slavists which was held there (V. V. Nimčuk, "Kijivs′ki hlaholični lystky", AN USSR). That edition contains extensive overview of the existing bibliography of the Kiev Folios.
Dating and origin.
The first page of the first folio was written later than other pages, probably at the transition from 11th to 12th century. Linguistic, paleographic and graphic features indicate South Croatian area as its place of origin. This page contains parts of Paul's epistles (13, 11-14 and 14, 1-4). That part of Kiev Folios and the problems associated with it have been thoroughly analyzed by the Croatian Slavist Marija Pantelić, who finally situates them somewhere in the Dubrovnik area.
The rest of the monument, containing part of the Roman Missal is dated at no later than the second half of the 10th century.
Content.
By content it is a Roman Missal, i.e., a book collecting all the text used at the holy mass service. Missal texts are accompanied by instructions on how to perform rites throughout the liturgical year, called "rubrics", which is a term originating from Latin word "rubrica" designating red soil used for painting. The text of the Kiev Missal folios has been for the most part written in black (the text meant to be pronounced), and for the lesser part in red (the instructions for gestures that the priest must perform and other instructions for the ceremony). Since Kiev Missal has only 13 pages preserved, it's obvious that only a part of the missal has been preserved, from the sacramentary containing crucial and unchangeable parts spoken by the priest.
Linguistic features.
The Kiev Folios are generally held by Slavists as the oldest among the OCS canon manuscripts, even though they exhibit several West Slavic features that place them at the beginning of the Czech-Moravian recension of OCS. These are:
As features that connect Kiev Folios to the canonic manuscripts of other Slavic areas (namely Bulgaro-Macedonian), one has to note:
Controversies.
Croatian Slavist Josip Hamm stirred a fierce debate in his book "Das Glagolitische Missale von Kiew" (Wien, 1979). In it, and in his other papers and lectures he maintained the view that the Kiev Folios are a 19th-century fake by Czech patriots in order to prove the antiquity of Czech literary culture. However, in general Slavists do not hold this view.

USS Pitkin (AK-204)

USS "Pitkin" (AK-204) was an "Alamosa"-class cargo ship that was constructed for the U.S. Navy during the closing period of World War II. By the time she was scheduled for commissioning, the war’s end caused her to be declared “excess to needs” and she was returned to the U.S. Government and struck by the Navy.
Career.
"Pitkin" (AK–204) was laid down under Maritime Commission contract by Globe Shipbuilding Co., Superior, Wisconsin. She was transferred to the Navy in May 1945. "Pitkin" was scheduled for commissioning. However, because of the Allied victory in the Pacific Ocean theatre of operations, her commissioning was cancelled. "Pitkin" was ordered returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission for disposal. She was subsequently renamed "Coastal Observer". Her subsequent fate is not known.

Aceh Party

The Aceh Party () is a regional political party in Indonesia. It contested for the first time in the 2009 elections in the province of Aceh. 
It was formerly known as GAM Party ("Partai GAM") after the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), the separatist group that fought for independence for the province. Many of its leaders were senior figures in the movement, and its chairman is the former commander of GAM's military wing. It was expected to be "the party to beat" in the elections, and was predicted to win in at least 15 of Aceh's 21 regencies. During the election campaign, there were attacks on party buildings and vehicles, including the use of grenades and bombings. Shots were also fired at party members. On several occasions, Indonesian Armed Forces personnel lowered Aceh Party flags.
Based on the result of the 2009 election, Aceh Party has 33 seats from total 69 seats available in Aceh Parliament (DPR Aceh).
The Aceh Party's candidate for the gubernatorial election in Aceh, Zaini Abdullah, was elected with a comfortable majority in the election held in 2012.

Charles Delucena Meigs

Dr. Charles Delucena Meigs (February 19, 1792 – June 22, 1869) was an influential American obstetrician of the nineteenth century who is remembered for his opposition to obstetrical anesthesia and to the idea that physicians' hands could transmit disease to their patients.
Biography.
Meigs was born February 19, 1792, in St. George, Bermuda, the son of Josiah Meigs and Clara Benjamin Meigs. He died June 22, 1869, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
He graduated in medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1817. In 1818 he was awarded an honorary degree of M.D. from Princeton University. Meigs specialized in obstetrics and was for a long time the acknowledged leader in this branch of medicine. In 1841, he became professor of obstetrics and diseases of women in the Jefferson Medical College, until his retirement in 1861. 
Meigs was a lifelong opponent of obstetric anesthesia. In 1856, he warned against the morally "doubtful nature of any process that the physicians set up to contravene the operations of those natural and physiological forces that the Divinity has ordained us to enjoy or to suffer". He also opposed the idea that doctors could convey childbed fever (a disease) on their hands on the grounds that "Doctors are gentlemen and a gentleman's hands are clean".
He was active as a translator from French. His translation of Gobineau's "Typhaines Abbey" was published in 1869. Until his death he corresponded with the book's author.
A son, Montgomery C. Meigs (1816–1892), achieved distinction as Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army during the American Civil War.

Francis Greville, 1st Earl of Warwick

Francis Greville, 1st Earl of Warwick KT (10 October 1719 – 8 July 1773), known as Lord Brooke from 1727 to 1746 and Earl Brooke from 1746 to 1759, was a British nobleman.
He inherited Warwick Castle and the title of Baron Brooke from his father in 1727. He was created Earl Brooke, of Warwick Castle, on 7 July 1746, and became Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire in 1749. He became a Knight of the Thistle in 1743.
In 1759, he petitioned for the title Earl of Warwick when the last Earl of Warwick from the Rich family died. Francis' petition was granted, and Warwick Castle was once again held by the Earls of Warwick. 
He was responsible for various renovations to the castle, including the construction of the State Dining Room and the private apartments. His early dalliances with the Neo-Gothic style even caught the attention of the infamous Horace Walpole, who referred to him once as "little Brooke". Lancelot "Capability" Brown was hired by the Earl to redesign the gardens and grounds surrounding the castle. He also employed the services of Giovanni Antonio Canal, who went onto paint five celebrated views of the castle. His son George Greville, 2nd Earl of Warwick further improved the castle and bought many of its present furnishings.
He married Elizabeth Hamilton, daughter of Lord Archibald Hamilton, by whom he had eight children:

George Greville, 2nd Earl of Warwick

George Greville, 2nd Earl of Warwick, FRS, FSA (16 September 1746 – 1816), styled Lord Greville until 1773, was a British nobleman and politician.
The eldest son of Francis Greville, 1st Earl Brooke (created Earl of Warwick in 1759), he was born on 16 September 1746 at Warwick Castle. He was baptised on 10 October 1746 at St. Mary's, Warwick, with King George I standing as his sponsor.
Education.
Lord Greville was educated from 1753 to 1754 at Eton College, and later matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford University, on 24 September 1764. He also matriculated at the University of Edinburgh. The "Royal Register" records that,
Early career.
He was invested as a Fellow of the Royal Society on 17 December 1767 and as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 14 February 1768. and he was Member of Parliament for Warwick between 1768 and 1773. In 1770, Greville was appointed to the Board of Trade.
On 1 April 1771, he married Hon. Georgiana Peachey, the daughter of James Peachey, 1st Baron Selsey, at St George's, Hanover Square. The couple had one son:
As a peer.
On 6 July 1773, Greville inherited his father's title of Earl of Warwick and left the House of Commons. He also left office on the Board of Trade in 1774, although he served as recorder of Warwick from 1773 to 1816. On 14 July 1776, he married Henrietta Vernon, the daughter of Richard Vernon and Lady Evelyn Leveson-Gower, at the house of her uncle Earl Gower in Whitehall. They had four children:
He became a colonel in the Warwickshire Fencibles in 1795, and was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire in that year, which office he held until his death on 2 May 1816 in London. He was buried at Warwick on 12 May 1816.
The Lives of Celebrated Persons records that "the latter part of the Earl's life was in penury, mortification and wretchedness." The Biographical Index to the House of Lords records that "this peer has evinced a predominant taste for chymistry, and if we mistake not greatly, a patent for soap for the navy that will not curdle in salt water was taken out in his name."
Collector and Patron.
George Greville was arguably one of the greatest contributors to the Greville Collection at Warwick Castle. His greatest purchase was the infamous Warwick Vase, acquired from his Uncle Sir William Hamilton by 1778. Although he furnished the Castle with several works from Classical Antiquity, his principle interest was in portraits. He amassed in his own words a "matchless collection of pictures by Sir Peter Paul Rubens and Sir Anthony Van Dyck", several of which are still in the collection at Warwick Castle. The first in-depth inventory of pictures dates from 1809, and records the wide range of pictures amassed by the Earl. However, it is still unclear which paintings were already in his father's collection, and exactly where he sourced the major works from.
He was also the first aristocratic patron to George Romney, from whom he commissioned several portraits of his children and two wives. He was most likely to have been introduced to Romney through Richard Cumberland (dramatist), and both probably encouraged him to depart on his travels to Italy in 1772. Although Greville had commissioned Romney to purchase paintings on his behalf in Italy, lack of pictures of quality meant that he returned empty handed. His brother Charles Francis Greville also sat to Romney, and introduced the artist to the muse Emma Hamilton. The offer of a studio in one of the towers of Warwick Castle was later turned down by the artist, who wished to remain in London.

Union Correctional Institution

Union Correctional Institution, formerly referred to as "Florida State Prison", "Raiford Prison" and "State Prison Farm" is located in unincorporated Union County, Florida, near Raiford. Opened in 1913, the prison underwent large scale renovation and restructure in 1961 splitting into the present day Union Correctional Institution and Florida State Prison. The prison has a maximum capacity of 2,172 prisoners. The institution has undergone large changes, both system and structural, since the opening almost 100 years ago. State Prison Farm was well known as one of the last prisons in America to abolish convict lease, in 1923.
History.
State Prison Farm.
Florida’s largest and oldest correctional institution was established in 1913 to house infirm inmates who could not be leased to private businesses. The initial population of the prison was close to 600 inmates, both male and female. Given the official name of Raiford Penitentiary, the facility was referred to almost exclusively as “State Prison Farm”, as convicts’ duties routinely included farming the prison property. The population at the facility remained fairly constant during these early years; the number of inmates needed for the farm would dictate the initial capacity for the prison. In January 1919, Captain J. S. Blitch was appointed warden and attempted to bring about positive change to the facility. The inmates were rewarded for their labors in the field with theatrical productions, and weekly baseball games. However, continued reports of guards beating inmates soured the positive image that Blitch was trying to publicize. Brutal treatment of inmates in the convict lease system would lead to the abandonment of convict lease in 1923. By the early 1920s, the large State Prison Farm property consisted of approximately under cultivation, kept in large part by the prisoners. Also on the property existed a shoe factory that made 10 pairs of shoes per day. Living conditions in the prison were very poor. The women especially lived in horrid conditions, housed separately from the men in overcrowded, wooden dormitories.
Race was a major source of conflict in the early years of the State Prison Farm. A study conducted in 1928 of the 1,101 received prisoners show that 674 (61%) of the total male inmates were of color and 427 (39%) were white. Segregation existed in all aspects of prison life, from working areas to hospitals to bathrooms. Eighty-three percent of executions at Raiford were of people of color, despite the fact that a much greater percentage of the Florida population was white.
Florida State Prison.
Following the abolition of convict lease and the subsequent increase in the inmate population, the prison structure changed. In 1927, a license tag factory was constructed, adding to the already extensive production line of the prison. The Main Housing Unit (“The Rock") was erected in 1928, a major step in the process of increasing the prison population. This building was kept in use until court order in 1985. (“The Rock” remained at the prison site unused until demolition in 1999.) By 1932, the inmate population was over 2,000, and a mess hall, auditorium and library had been added. The expanding prison also added a laundry and shirt factory around this time. Shortly after, in 1935, a maximum security building was constructed, the “Flat Top”. This proved vital in the expansion of the center, as from this stage forward the prison would remain a maximum security facility. This was also the year the “West Unit” was built to house female offenders which remained in use until 1954 when the Florida Correctional institution in Ocala was opened and all the female inmates were transferred from Raiford to the new facility (the West Unit remained in use as a medical facility until 1968). In 1955, the “East Unit”, a new maximum security facility was completed.
The East Unit became a separate institution in 1961, renamed Florida State Prison. Construction would continue on this site until 1972. The original prison site became known as Union Correctional Institution, as it is still known today. A new Death Row was constructed in 1992, coinciding with the relocation of inmates from the State Prison next door. The present-day facility still uses many of the older buildings, some since before the prison split in 1961. The prison has an eclectic range of facilities, from hearing impaired and elderly accommodation to designated confinement space. The prison also has a variety of living residences, such as cell units, house units and self-contained houses.
A 1999 report by the "St. Petersburg Times" took a detailed look into issues of racism and diversity in the Union Correctional Institution. The report stated that more than half of the inmates were black, and more than 75% of the guards were white. This alone was grounds for racial tension. Several officers and inmates reported a clique of racist guards, distinguishable by the cord key chains they would wear. Problems turned out to be far more significant, however, after a review of public records and court files revealed over 100 black agency employees were involved in lawsuits alleging rampant racism and discrimination in the prison system. Perhaps worst of these allegations, a black recreation manager once arrived at his desk to find across his bulletin board the letters “KKK”. The report also included the story of a 1993 incident; inmates on death-row were exposed to a man wearing a KKK-style white sheet walking by their cells.

Simon Basinger

Simon Basinger (born 1957) is a French musicologist and essayist.
Early life and education.
Simon Basinger was born in Oujda, Morocco in 1957, in a family that has had musicians over three generations. 
He began his music studies at the Conservatory of Nanterre, Versailles, and then attended the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris, where he studied musicology and composition. Meanwhile, he found employment in the theater, as an assistant to Pierre Debauche in the Théâtre Nanterre-Amandiers (1974). 
After studying literature and philosophy, he obtained a professorship but decided instead to pursue a career in the world of art. He wrote a thesis on Kabuki and Noh theater, an essay on Reynaldo Hahn with Paul Dube (Montreal), and a biography of Antônio Carlos Jobim. In 1975, he met Roland Petit, Erté, Yves Saint-Laurent, Michel Colombier the Casino de Paris and was artistically inspired.
Artistic career.
In 1975, he became the youngest assistant (staging) of the company Renaud-Barrault alongside Madeleine Renaud and Jean-Louis Barrault in the Theatre d'Orsay-Gare d'Orsay in Paris. He worked with Simone Benmussa on the latest editions of Cahiers Renaud-Barrault, and met Marguerite Duras, Samuel Beckett, Marie-Helene Dasté, Catherine Eckerle, and Madeleine Milhaud. 
He participated alongside Jean Louis Barrault in the production of "Christopher Columbus" by Claudel and Milhaud, and "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" by Nietsche. 
In 2000, he worked with the Arte TV network on the documentary "Jean Genet...l'Autre" (France Television), produced by Richard Trank in association with the Simon Wiesenthal Center (Los Angeles). 
In 2002, in collaboration with the National Foundation for Gerontology, he produced a documentary on music and gerontology, entitled "Le Jardin d'hiver" ("The Winter Garden") for France 3 TV Aquitaine and NGF.
In 2003, wrote the libretto of the "Kippur" Oratorio for narrator, soprano, tenor, children's choir and string orchestra, set to music by C. Max Jehuda Ewert of Germany for the Avant-garde Festival of Munich. 
In 2004, he published "La French", a look at art in Europe for Francophone audiences in Florida. 
In 2005, he worked at the "Música Popular Brasileira" (popular music of Brazil) exhibit at the Cité de la Musique in Paris, and published an essay on Antonio Carlos Jobim and his influence on music in Brazil. He wrote a series of poems for in English the American series Nexus about philosophy and raison d'être. 
In 2006-2007, he worked with Issa Nyaphaga and Dezza Nguembock to promote the shows "Bigna" and "Esthetique & Handicap" for Afrik'DEZ'Arts, an international art association, in collaboration with the Cameroon Embassy in Paris.
In September 2007, he took the "Cahiers Renaud-Barrault" created by Simone Benmussa and re-infused it with a modern adaptation. In September 2008, the creation of "Je Me Souviens de Toi" ("I Remember You") was commissioned by Radio France, with text by Mathieu Carrière and music of Henryk Gorecki. A short version aired on the show "Contes du Jour et de la Nuit" in France with Véronique Sauger as producer.
Poulenc.
Since 1990, Basinger has been passionate about the composer Francis Poulenc. He has written a series of books called "Cahiers de Francis Poulenc" which look at the life and work of the composer. The work is supported by the Association of Friends of Francis Poulenc and supervised by Georges Prêtre, and by many artists.
Recent activities.
Basinger is a contributor to the publications of the Barcelona Opera, and writes a column called "Arts & Spectacles" for the South Florida Sun Sentinel. In 2010 he published a poetry collection called "À la manière de..." ("How To..."), a collection of poems written between the years 1980 and 2000, in the manner of Cocteau, Eluard, and Prévert, prefaced by Véronique Sauger, and a children's book titled "Un Morceau de Ciel" ("A Piece of Heaven") (éditions Eastern-Press).

Covariance group

In physics, covariance group is a group of coordinate transformations between admissible frames of reference (see for example). The frames are assumed to provide equivalent description of physical phenomena. The covariance principle suggests the equations, describing the laws of physics, should transform from one admitted frame to another covariantly, that is, according to a representation of the covariance group.
In special relativity only inertial frames are admitted and the covariance group consists of rotations, velocity boosts, and the parity transformation. It is denoted as formula_1 and is often referred to as Lorentz group.
For example, the Maxwell equation with sources,
transforms as a four-vector, that is, under the (½,½) representation of the formula_1 group.
The Dirac equation,
transforms as a bispinor, that is, under the (½,0)⊕(0,½) representation of the formula_1 group.
The covariance principle, unlike the relativity principle, does not imply that the equations are invariant under transformations from the covariance group. In practice the equations for electromagnetic and strong interactions "are" invariant, while the weak interaction is not invariant under the parity transformation. For example, the Maxwell equation "is" invariant, while the corresponding equation for the weak field explicitly contains left currents and thus is not invariant under the parity transformation.
In general relativity the covariance group consists of all arbitrary (invertible and suitably differentiable) coordinate transformations.

Mark Felix

Mark Felix (born 17 April 1966 in Grenada) is a strongman competitor and regular entrant to the World's Strongest Man competition. Felix has won numerous international grip contests, including the Rolling Thunder World Championships in 2008 & 2009, as well as the Vice Grip Viking Challenge in 2011 and 2012. Felix has also held the Rolling Thunder world record since 2008, as well as the Captains of Crush "COC" Silver Bullet world record. Due largely in part to his grip achievements, Felix is widely regarded as having the strongest grip in the world.
Early life.
Mark Felix was born in 1966 in Grenada. At the age of 23 he moved to Great Harwood, Lancashire, England. He was a dedicated body builder and turned his attention to strongman competitions in 2003 at the age of 37, comparatively late in relation to other strength athletes.
Strongman career.
Mark Felix turned pro as a strongman within a year when the IFSA Strongman Federation was launched in 2004. 
Felix came third in England's Strongest Man in 2004, and in 2005 he went on to come second to Eddy Elwood in the IFSA version of England's Strongest Man (England's Strongest Man (IFSA)). This led him to the IFSA British Championships which he won in 2005. Of the five events, Felix won three (Deadlift, Farmer’s Walk and Atlas Stones). Aftwerwards Felix credited his victory to ""Big hands, big heart"" 
In 2005, Felix was invited to compete in the IFSA World Open in Sao Paulo, Brazil which was a qualifier for the 2005 IFSA Strongman World Championships later in the year, but he failed to finish in the top 4 and did not qualify for the IFSA World Championships.
Felix also competed in the IFSA World Team Championships in 2005 as a part of Team World as a representative of Grenada, the team placed third overall. 
In 2006 Mark placed second in the Britain's Strongest Man competition and this led to a place in the 2006 World's Strongest Man in which he placed fourth in the finals. In 2007 he repeated his second place finish in Britain's Strongest Man and finished seventh in the 2007 World's Strongest Man. In the same year he also finished third in the Strongman Super Series 2007 Mohegan Sun Grand Prix. 
In 2008 he came fourth in Europe's Strongest Man and went on to finish third in Britain's Strongest Man, qualifying him for a third successive WSM appearance. Felix has said ""Every year I gain more experience and learn more about what I am capable of.""
Rolling Thunder/Grip.
Felix won the inaugural 2008 Rolling Thunder World Championships which took place during the 2008 Fortissimus contest in Canada. He also set a new world record with a lift of 301 lb.
In June 2009, Felix successfully defended his Rolling Thunder World Championships title.
Felix won the inaugural 2011 Vice Grip Viking Challenge which took place on 29-30 January 2011 at the LA Fitexpo.
Felix retained his Vice Grip title by winning the 2012 Vice Grip Viking Challenge, he also set a world record in the Captains of Crush "COC" Silver Bullet event (holding a suspended weight from within the handles of a Captains of Crush no. 3 gripper) with a time of 43.25 seconds.
Felix recently set a new Rolling Thunder world record at the 2012 Bodypower Expo in Birmingham, England with a lift of , more than 20 lbs. heavier than his previous world record of .

Conasauga shale

The Conasauga Shale is a Cambrian geologic unit in the Appalachian thrust and fault region of Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. The formation consists of shales and carbonates that have structurally thickened to over in certain areas by successive orogenic events (Taconic orogeny, Acadian orogeny, Alleghenian orogeny) that impact the southern Appalachians.
Shale gas is being produced from the unit in some areas. The thick shale-carbonate sequence affords the possibility of recoverable gas reserves, as recent drilling has shown the formation to possess gas.
Geography.
The Conasauga shale overlies the Rome Formation, and in turn is overlain by the Knox Formation. The Conasauga Shale is present as far south as Talladega County, Alabama, and extends north to Calhoun, Cleburne, St. Clair, Etowah, Cherokee, and DeKalb Counties, and into Northwest Georgia.
The Conasauga has one of the thickest shale sections in the world. Total organic content of the shale ranges from 0.5% to 1.5%. The Schlumberger Montage Shale log filed with the Alabama Oil and Gas Board calculates gas in place as 330.2 billion feet3 per square mile of gas (3.57 billion m3 per km2) in place for every thickness of shale. This area has a unique subsidence and thrust zone under it that geologist William Thomas has classified as a "mushwad".
Natural gas.
The Conasauga Shale is a shale gas reservoir, like the Barnett Shale in Texas. The shale is very hard, and until technological advancements as have been honed in the exploration and drilling of the Barnett Shale, it was too costly to extract. The Conasauga Shale is hydro-sensitive, as the shale will absorb water and swell, thereby slowing the flow of gas. Successful drilling of the Conasauga involves utilizing techniques minimizing water use and flow into the open-hole drilling techniques. Casing is normally used only until penetration into the Conasauga, and then left open-hole so that multiple gas layers within the hole may flow to the borehole.
History and well completion.
The J.J. Young 34-2 #1 well in St. Clair County, Alabama (Alabama State Oil and Gas Board Permit No. 4325) was drilled as a joint venture between Amoco and ARCO. This well was spudded on October 30, 1984. The well was initially drilled with air to approximately when it encountered a significant quantity of gas that reportedly required closing the blowout preventer. The engineers for both Amoco and Arco said that the J. J. Young #1 would flow over one million feet3 of gas per day (over 28,000 m3). The well was plugged on February 16, 1985. It was discovered that Amoco did not have title to nine forties around the Young #1 well because the minerals had been severed in 1888.
During the late 1980s Michigan Oil Co. acquired in this area. Before Michigan Oil could drill this prospect, they were bought out by Pan-Oak Corp in 1991. In 1993, they drilled the Young #2 well, north of the #1 well. They drilled to a total depth of and were unable to log the well. The driller reported that they had good gas shows.
Dominion.
In July 2002, Red Hills Resources started leasing in the Young #1 area. After acquiring approximately , they put together the Big Canoe Prospect package, which was offered to numerous potential industry partners. In late 2004, Red Hills sold 51% of the prospect to Dominion Black Warrior Basin Inc.
Dominion took over operations of the prospect and on March 8, 2005 spudded the Dawson 34-3 No. 1 well west of the Young #1 well. After drilling out from under the surface pipe, they encountered their first good gas kick at , which was flared to the pit. The second major gas show was encountered at , when the well exploded with a huge fire ball.
The next day, while drilling at , the rig broke down and was down for approximately 30 hours During this time the well was flared to the pit, at an estimated 750 to 1000 million feet3 of gas per day with no apparent pressure draw down. When drilling resumed, it started to rain, and within three hours the roaring gas flare slowed to a lazy flare. At 4:30 PM on March 19, the well encountered its third major gas show when it blew out at . The explosion of a plus fire ball was witnessed by numerous valley residents.
Energen.
In January 2006, Energen Resources drilled the Williams 29-12 #1 well southwest of the Dawson #1 well. Immediately after the well was drilled, Energen and Dominion entered a bidding war for the remaining leases in north St. Clair County.
The Dominion Andrews 27-14 #3 well was spudded April 20, 2006 and drilled to , where the bit fell three feet and then the well blew out. The rig’s blowout preventers could not handle the pressure. Dominion fought the well for three days, during which the rig was at imminent risk of burning down. Their head engineer testified at the Alabama Oil & Gas Board hearing on February 16, 2007: "We brought in world-class well control experts to control this well," and "The gas encountered presented a significant danger to the drilling rig, the personnel, and it had to be controlled." When the opposing attorney asked him how good the well was, the engineer said, "To my knowledge we never put that gas through any type of meter." When asked about pressure information for the well, he falsely responded they had none, though after they got the well under control, they bolted a three-port manifold to the blowout preventer. The well’s shut-in pressure was reported at 1,835 psi. The crew opened up all three ports, and the well blew for twelve hours at 1,755 psi flowing pressure with no pressure draw down. When they shut the well in, it returned to 1,835 psi. The size of the ports were not reported, however, it was estimated that the well was flowing at of gas per day. Dominion cemented the drill string in the hole by trying to hang cement at the top of the hole. The cement fell to the bottom of the hole sealing off the good gas zone.
The Oakes E23-11 #26 was permitted to a depth of . The well was spudded on February 11, 2007. They set of 9 5/8-inch surface casing. They encountered an excellent gas-filled fracture zone at approximately .
This well is hooked up and selling gas. Late afternoon, on May 14, 2007, this well was flowing at 808 million feet3 of gas per day with a flowing tubing pressure of 3000 psi. All the surface equipment was covered in several inches of ice, indicating that some CO2 still remained in the gas.
The Burgess E28-11 #58 well, while drilling (on April 12 that year) at kicked so hard that they had to light the flare stack. Dominion prefers to vent the gas but is under orders from the state to flare the gas if it exceeds 300 million feet3 of gas per day. The local residents said it had a vertical flare and roared like a train. On April 14, while drilling at , the well blew out with a ball of fire that went over into the air. It rattled windows over a mile away. After everything settled down, the vertical stack was burning a flare. One report has the well flaring 500 mcfg for the first hour. Drilling resumed after three hours. They reached total depth of on April 19, 2007.
Energen Resources out of Birmingham, Alabama started buying leases in the St.Clair and Etowah Counties in June 2005. In February 2006, Energen drilled the Williams 19-12-101 well southeast of the Dawson #1. In March 2006, Energen drilled the GAA 23-12 #1 well northeast of the Dawson #1. This well never reached planned total depth due to deviation problems, and was plugged.
Chesapeake Energy.
Cheasapeake and Energen have a joint venture covering gross, for which Chesapeake reportedly paid Energen $750 per acre, plus a commitment of $30 million for joint drilling and development. Chesapeake and Energen have a non-compete agreement, whereby they share additional acreage acquired by either entity.
Highmount.
Loews Corporation, controlled by the wealthy Tisch family, became a substantial leader in the Conasauga Shale in July 2007 via the purchase of natural gas assets from Dominion. A portion of these purchased assets included all of Dominion Black Warrior Basin, holder of all Dominion's Conasauga Shale assets and a fully owned subsidiary of Dominion. Loews assigned Dominion's Alabama operations to Highmount Exploration.
Northeast Alabama Gas District.
Northeast Alabama Gas District’s territory covers Talladega, Calhoun, and Cleburne Counties, less the areas inside municipal limits and one small area in the Southern part of Cleburne County currently served by another Gas District. The Gas District’s territorial limits begin outside of each incorporated municipality in these three counties and from any municipal pipelines that extent outside the municipalities.
The Gas District is a public corporation in the State of Alabama. The District has granted an exclusive franchise for drilling, production and pipeline transportation for natural gas within its territory to a Special District created specifically for this purpose. Owners of mineral rights within this territory desiring their natural gas reserves to be developed have the option to sign an agreement with the Gas District. Royalties provided by the District are equal to 20% of production and are higher than those reportedly being offered by the for-profit operators in surrounding areas. The Gas District has five charitable trusts for education, health care, social services, long-term care and economic development and job creation that receive a portion of the natural gas revenues to provide additional benefits for residents in the region.

Matt Carmichael (footballer)

Matthew Carmichael (born 13 May 1964) is a former English footballer who played 249 games in the Football league, scoring 48 times.
League career.
A PT instructor in the Royal Artillery, Carmichael signed for Lincoln City on a month's trial in 1989. Thrust straight into Lincoln's first team at centre-forward, Carmichael responded by scoring, on his debut against Scunthorpe United. In his second season at the club, Carmichael made occasional appearances at centre-half as well as centre-forward and spent both the 1991–1992 and 1992–1993 seasons as a virtual ever present at the heart of Lincoln's defence. In 1991/92 he was Lincoln's Player of the Season. In the summer of 1993 he left Lincoln for Scunthorpe United, in a part-exchange deal with Dave Hill.
Restored to the forward line at Scunthorpe, Carmichael scored a total of 24 goals, with 18 in the league, during a highly successful 1993–1994 season. He also established a club record when between 28 December 1993 and 19 February 1994 he scored in eight successive matches. However, he struggled to maintain such form the following season and joined Barnet on a month's loan in September 1994 before joining Preston North End in March 1995 for the remainder of the season, briefly playing alongside a young David Beckham.
He made a solitary, goalscoring, appearance for Mansfield Town at the start of the 1995–1996 season before linking up with Doncaster Rovers and then, at the end of February, Darlington. He helped Darlington reach the 1996 Endsleigh League Division Three play-off final where they were defeated 1–0 by Plymouth Argyle on 25 May 1996 at Wembley Stadium.
Post League career.
Following his release by Darlington, Carmichael played four games for TPS Turku in the Finnish Veikkausliiga, and he scored one goal for them, on 30 June 1996 against HJK Helsinki. He then joined Aylesbury United, and he scored on his debut for them in the 2–1 away defeat to Hitchin Town on 17 August 1996. His last game for the Ducks was on 12 April 1997 against Heybridge Swifts. Carmichael then linked up with Ilkeston Town, under the management of the man who transferred him from Lincoln, Keith Alexander. 
Carmichael later played for Boston United in the 1998/99 season (where he scored 20 times in 34 matches), and had a 10-game spell with Grantham Town in the 1999–2000 season.
He later joined Wisbech Town, then under the management of his former Boston United teammate Ian Stringfellow, debuting in the 1–1 home draw with Histon on 26 September 2000. However, after just five league games and one goal for the Fenman, financial constraints saw six of the squad, Carmichael included, depart the club following the 2–0 home defeat to Newport IOW on 21 October 2000. Carmichael moved on to Lincoln United but a persistent back injury curtailed his appearances and he wound his career down with various clubs in the Lincoln & District Sunday League.
After being kit manager at Lincoln City he was appointed in May 2012 as manager at Lincoln Moorlands Railway but he left the club after three months.

GRT Group

GRT Group plc was a bus operating company in the United Kingdom. Created in 1989 as a holding company to effect the buyout of Grampian Regional Transport (GRT), it grew by acquisition and in 1995 merged with Badgerline to create FirstBus plc, forerunner to worldwide transport company FirstGroup plc.
History.
The GRT Group, as GRT Holdings, was formed as a holding company to effect the purchase of Grampian Regional Transport (GRT), the city bus operator in Aberdeen, Scotland, by its employees. Motivation for the buyout was the 1988 announcement that the Scottish Bus Group was to be privatised, sparking fears that GRT could be acquired by a larger group and asset stripped. The buyout was achieved on 20 January 1989. General Manager Moir Lockhead, together with four others in a management buyout team, took a 51% stake in the new company, with employees gaining 33%, and Aberdeen Asset Management and 3i taking the remaining 16%. At the time GRT comprised a fleet of 200 buses and 500 employees.
Subsequently, the parent company GRT Group was listed on the stock market as GRT Group plc. The group grew by acquisition of some of the other newly privatised bus companies in the UK.
Acquisitions.
As GRT Holdings:
As GRT Bus Group plc:
Midland, Eastern and Lowland Scottish, and Eastern Counties, were regional companies, with operating territories stretching over large areas comprising town and interurban services. The Northampton and Leicester operations were town based networks, like Grampian.
Firstbus.
In June 1995, GRT group plc merged with Badgerline, another large UK bus group, to form FirstBus, launching a new corporate identity. In 1998 FirstBus became FirstGroup plc.
Livery.
As GRT Group, the company had developed a form of corporate livery dictated by an arrangement of a horizontal and diagonal bands over a base colour. The colour scheme of the bands were derived from colours representative of the subsidiary company, while the base colour was chosen as cream. The companies retained their own version of a company logo. Some companies developed an alternate livery with a gold band for the introduction of new buses.
With the emergence of Firstbus, the former GRT companies retained their coroporate livery, with the individual company logos replaced with the company name in a new standard corporate typeface, along with a styilised "f" symbol representing FirstBus.
Moir Lockhead.
Sir Moir Lockhead had joined Grampian Transport as general manager in 1985. He remained with the GRT Group and as of 2008 was Chief Executive and Deputy Chairman of First Group. In 1996 he was made an OBE for services to the bus industry, and in 2008 was knighted.

<doc id="19260930" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19260930" title="Fault-tolerant computer system">
Fault-tolerant computer system

Fault-tolerant computer systems are systems designed around the concepts of fault tolerance. In essence, they have to be able to keep working to a level of satisfaction in the presence of faults.
Types of fault tolerance.
Most fault-tolerant computer systems are designed to be able to handle several possible failures, including hardware-related faults such as hard disk failures, input or output device failures, or other temporary or permanent failures; software bugs and errors; interface errors between the hardware and software, including driver failures; operator errors, such as erroneous keystrokes, bad command sequences, or installing unexpected software; and physical damage or other flaws introduced to the system from an outside source.
Hardware fault-tolerance is the most common application of these systems, designed to prevent failures due to hardware components. Typically, components have multiple backups and are separated into smaller "segments" that act to contain a fault, and extra redundancy is built into all physical connectors, power supplies, fans, etc. There are special software and instrumentation packages designed to detect failures, such as fault masking, which is a way to ignore faults by seamlessly preparing a backup component to execute something as soon as the instruction is sent, using a sort of voting protocol where if the main and backups don't give the same results, the flawed output is ignored.
Software fault-tolerance is based more around nullifying programming errors using real-time redundancy, or static "emergency" subprograms to fill in for programs that crash. There are many ways to conduct such fault-regulation, depending on the application and the available hardware.
History.
The first known fault-tolerant computer was SAPO, built in 1951 in Czechoslovakia by Antonin Svoboda. Its basic design was magnetic drums connected via relays, with a voting method of memory error detection. Several other machines were developed along this line, mostly for military use. Eventually, they separated into three distinct categories: machines that would last a long time without any maintenance, such as the ones used on NASA space probes and satellites; computers that were very dependable but required constant monitoring, such as those used to monitor and control nuclear power plants or supercollider experiments; and finally, computers with a high amount of runtime which would be under heavy use, such as many of the supercomputers used by insurance companies for their probability monitoring.
Most of the development in the so-called LLNM (Long Life, No Maintenance) computing was done by NASA during the 1960s, in preparation for Project Apollo and other research aspects. NASA's first machine went into a space observatory, and their second attempt, the JSTAR computer, was used in Voyager. This computer had a backup of memory arrays to use memory recovery methods and thus it was called the JPL Self-Testing-And-Repairing computer. It could detect its own errors and fix them or bring up redundant modules as needed. The computer is still working today.
Hyper-dependable computers were pioneered mostly by aircraft manufacturers, nuclear power companies, and the railroad industry in the USA. These needed computers with massive amounts of uptime that would fail gracefully enough with a fault to allow continued operation, while relying on the fact that the computer output would be constantly monitored by humans to detect faults. Again, IBM developed the first computer of this kind for NASA for guidance of Saturn V rockets, but later on BNSF, Unisys, and General Electric built their own.
In general, the early efforts at fault-tolerant designs were focused mainly on internal diagnosis, where a fault would indicate something was failing and a worker could replace it. SAPO, for instance, had a method by which faulty memory drums would emit a noise before failure. Later efforts showed that, to be fully effective, the system had to be self-repairing and diagnosing – isolating a fault and then implementing a redundant backup while alerting a need for repair. This is known as N-model redundancy, where faults cause automatic fail safes and a warning to the operator, and it is still the most common form of level one fault-tolerant design in use today.
Voting was another initial method, as discussed above, with multiple redundant backups operating constantly and checking each other's results, with the outcome that if, for example, four components reported an answer of 5 and one component reported an answer of 6, the other four would "vote" that the fifth component was faulty and have it taken out of service. This is called M out of N majority voting.
Historically, motion has always been to move further from N-model and more to M out of N due to the fact that the complexity of systems and the difficulty of ensuring the transitive state from fault-negative to fault-positive did not disrupt operations.
Tandem and Stratus were among the first companies specializing in the design of fault-tolerant computer systems for online transaction processing.
Fault tolerance verification and validation.
The most important requirement of design in a fault tolerant computer system is making sure it actually meets its requirements for reliability. This is done by using various failure models to simulate various failures, and analyzing how well the system reacts. These statistical models are very complex, involving probability curves and specific fault rates, latency curves, error rates, and the like. The most commonly used models are HARP, SAVE, and SHARPE in the USA, and SURF or LASS in Europe.
Fault tolerance research.
Research into the kinds of tolerances needed for critical systems involves a large amount of interdisciplinary work. The more complex the system, the more carefully all possible interactions have to be considered and prepared for. Considering the importance of high-value systems in transport, public utilities and the military, the field of topics that touch on research is very wide: it can include such obvious subjects as software modeling and reliability, or hardware design, to arcane elements such as stochastic models, graph theory, formal or exclusionary logic, parallel processing, remote data transmission, and more.
Failure-oblivious computing.
"Failure-oblivious computing" is a technique that enables computer programs to continue executing despite memory errors. The technique handles attempts to read invalid memory by returning a manufactured value to the program, which in turn, makes use of the manufactured value and ignores the former memory value it tried to access. This is a great contrast to typical memory checkers, which inform the program of the error or abort the program. In failure-oblivious computing, no attempt is made to inform the program that an error occurred.
The approach has performance costs: because the technique rewrites code to insert dynamic checks for address validity, execution time will increase by 80% to 500%.

<doc id="19260944" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19260944" title="Downtown Cohoes Historic District">
Downtown Cohoes Historic District

The Downtown Cohoes Historic District takes up of the city of Cohoes, New York, United States. Many of the 165 contributing properties date from the 1820-1930 period when the Erie Canal and Harmony Mills were the mainstay of the city's economy. It was recognized as a historic district and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. After years of neglect and decline, it has recently started to see an upswing in business activity due to its historic character and the city's efforts to protect it.
It is a roughly triangular area encompassing most of the city's business district, along the axes of Ontario and Remsen streets. Most of its buildings are contributing properties, with only a few late 20th-century intrusions; most of those are residential or commercial and in-use but they also include several churches, factories, a train station and the city hall. They range in architectural styles from Federal to Art Moderne.
One building within the district, Cohoes Music Hall, was listed on the National Register before the creation of the district. Another National Register listing, the Silliman Memorial Presbyterian Church, was demolished in 1998. A similar fate befell a church building designed by Richard Upjohn after it burned in 1894, but its rectory survives.
Geography.
The district is bounded by Oneida Street on the north and the former Delaware and Hudson Railroad (now CSX) tracks on the east. On the west it takes the form of an irregular diagonal beginning at the intersection of Columbia and Remsen streets at the southeast, cutting through the middle of several blocks, and ending at Ontario and Olmstead streets in the northeast.
Directly adjacent to this northeastern corner is the separately-designated Olmstead Street Historic District, which includes the Ogden Mill and row houses built for textile workers, a short distance to the northeast. To the north and east flow the Mohawk and Hudson rivers, respectively.
Most of the land in the district is developed in the form of commercial and industrial buildings, with a few churches and Cohoes's city hall. There are some vacant lots on the edges, most notably the former canal bed at the northeast corner. The land is relatively level, reflecting the nearby river confluence.
The main route through the district is NY 470, which follows Ontario Street. It leads east to Troy across the river via the 112th Street Bridge and west to Colonie. The north-south routes 32 and 787 are located along the Hudson, just to the immediate east of the district.
History.
From its settlement in the 17th century through the years after independence, Cohoes was a quiet farming community inhabited by a few families of Dutch descent. When outsiders came to Cohoes, it was to see the Cohoes Falls along the Mohawk, the source of the town's name.
The construction of the canal from 1817 to 1832 changed that. There were less than 25 buildings in the current district before 1831, but industrialization had already begun with some mills along the Mohawk. One, the Cohoes Company, began building the smaller local canal system that would provide power to many of the early businesses.
By 1837 the canal had been so successful that the company spent five years acquiring land for and then building the newer Enlarged Erie Canal, to handle larger shipping. The route, and several locks, can still be seen and followed from the northeast corner of the district to Lock 18 near the western city limit. Main Street today follows the original canal bed. In the northern part of the city, former land of the original Erie Canal was reacquired in 1846 by the Cohoes Company for its local power canal system.
The canal's success led to the population of the town doubling in the 1840s, and a corresponding building boom. As a result the town incorporated as a village, electing its first board in 1848. At this time most of today's streets were mapped and laid out. The district was the only developed area of town; it was surrounded by farmland. The railroad was built, further extending the reach of local industry and creating more jobs.
In the second half of the century, particularly once the Civil War had ended, the textile industry's growth in the town fueled another boom. The first mill, the Troy Manufacturing Co., was opened on Ontario Street in 1843. It was thought to be the first in the country devoted to manufacturing hosiery and knit products. It failed within a decade, but a new owner took over and Cohoes went from three mills in 1852 to 27 by 1886, employing 4,000 people. The thousand-foot (300 m) Harmony Mills complex was the world's largest cotton processing facility when it opened in 1872, and later came to be identified with the town.
The earlier growth expanded, and by 1870 11,100 had settled in the village. That year it reincorporated as a city. The new construction, and reconstruction and expansion of existing properties, brought new homes and churches to the downtown area. One of the latter, St. John's Episcopal Church, was designed by Richard Upjohn, the architect of many of America's notable churches from that era, and built in 1870. It was destroyed by fire a quarter-century later, and replaced by a newer building but its rectory remains in use. The Music Hall, the district's best Second Empire-style building, was opened in 1874.
Kansas state architect J.C. Holland designed the Romanesque/Chateauesque City Hall in 1896. It was complemented by the Romanesque Silliman Memorial Presbyterian Church (since demolished), named by local benefactor Horace Silliman for his parents and opened the same year just across the street.
Downtown was mostly built out by the start of the 20th century, but there are still some notable bank buildings from that period in the contemporary Classical Revival style. Construction slowed after World War I, reflecting the decline of the industries that had fueled the city's growth in the previous century. The Mechanics' Bank and Cohoes Theatre, the latter designed and built in the 1930s (although not opened until 1941), are the only buildings downtown in the style.
The onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s halted all construction and put an end to Cohoes' days as an industrial center. At the same time, it meant that no alterations would take place to existing buildings, leaving them intact (if often vacant and neglected) for when the district was added to the Register 50 years later. A planned revitalization in the 1970s and '80s to create an urban mall similar to those in Amsterdam and Batavia, which would have meant demolishing or altering many of the older buildings, was never fully implemented.
Significant contributing properties.
All but ten of the 175 properties within the district are considered sufficiently historic to be contributing to its overall character. They include residences, commercial buildings (including some factories) churches, the city hall, post office and former train station.
Preservation and renewal.
The historic buildings have been attractive to some redevelopers as the city continues efforts to recover from the decline of its major industries and redefine itself as a bedroom community for Albany. "The revitalization of Remsen Street is the keystone to the City's future success", said a 2002 city plan for improving and revitalizing downtown. It recommended a $3.1 million plan to improve the streets and lighting in the district, with an emphasis on preserving or restoring its historic character.
The city has made some grants available for facade restoration and improvements to the rental properties above the storefronts with the goal of promoting a mix of uses among office, residential and retail. The Capital District Transportation Committee did a study that used the downtown historic district in its "Linkage" program as one of three "corridors" in Cohoes in which it recommended changes that could be made to stimulate redevelopment.
Within three years during the 2000s the value of construction projects with city issued building permits increased almost fivefold. Many of the businesses that have located in the city have been niche and specialty retailers. By 2006, there was over a million dollars in private investment downtown. A Rite Aid was built on the lot at the west edge of the district known as Bush's Block, on the site of the former Victor Carrybag building. In 2007 the city began hosting a farmers' market on Remsen Street during growing season.
To ensure that new construction preserves the character of the historic district, the city has enacted a "historic overlay district" within its zoning code which includes all the city's historic areas. The code requires that any new construction or redevelopment affecting an exterior or interior space visible from outside be approved by the city's Historic Preservation and Architectural Review Board, to ensure that contributing properties '"historic features be altered as little as possible."

Garuda Indonesia Flight 421

Garuda Indonesia Flight 421 was a scheduled domestic flight operated by Indonesian flag carrier Garuda Indonesia covering about 625 kilometers, from Ampenan to Yogyakarta. On January 16, 2002, the Boeing 737-300 aircraft experienced a flameout in both of its CFM International CFM56 engines about 90 seconds after entering a thunderstorm with heavy rain and hail after the BLORA point. The crew tried, but failed, to restart the engines three times. They then tried to start the auxiliary power unit which failed as well. The Co-Pilot tried to transmit a Mayday, but failed. Then, the aircraft disappeared from the Radar and Jogja Tower asked the Pelita Air plane to take a holding above the Solo and its region. As the aircraft descended below the overcast layer of clouds at approximately 8,000' AGL, the pilots saw the Bengawan Solo River and decided to attempt a ditching with the flaps and gear retracted. When the aircraft made an emergency landing, the plane hit a rock in the river and underwent sudden decompression that caused one flight attendant to be sucked away from the plane. Additionally, some passengers and flight attendants received minor injuries. After the emergency landing, the Pilot, Capt. Abdul Razak contacted the Jogja Tower, and said that they had made an emergency landing on Bengawan Solo. The evacuation team arrived shortly after the incident and all the passengers were evacuated safely. The aircraft was written-off as a total loss.
Aircraft.
The aircraft, a Boeing 737-3Q8, registration PK-GWA, was acquired by Garuda Indonesia. The aircraft was manufactured in 1989.

Offshore concrete structure

Offshore concrete structures have been in use successfully for about 30 years. They serve the same purpose as their steel counterparts in the oil and gas production and storage. The first concrete oil platform has been installed in the North Sea in the Ekofisk field in 1973 by Phillips Petroleum. Since then 47 major concrete offshore structures have been built, whereby 21 of the 47 concrete substructures have been designed (concept and detail designs ) by Dr. techn. Olav Olsen.
Introduction.
Concrete offshore structures are mostly used in the petroleum industry as drilling, extraction or storage units for crude oil or natural gas. Those large structures house machinery and equipment needed to drill and/or extract oil and gas. But concrete structures are not only limited to applications within the oil and gas industry. Several conceptual studies have shown recently, that concrete support structures for offshore wind turbines are very competitive compared to common steel structures, especially for larger water depths.
Depending on the circumstances, platforms may be attached to the ocean floor, consist of an artificial island, or be floating. Generally, offshore concrete structures are classified into fixed and floating structures. Fixed structures are mostly built as concrete gravity based structures (CGS, also termed as caisson type), where the loads bear down directly on the uppermost layers as soil pressure. The caisson provides buoyancy during construction and towing and acts also as a foundation structure in the operation phase. Furthermore, the caisson could be used as storage volume for oil or other liquids.
Floating units will be held in position by anchored wires or chains in a spread mooring pattern. Because of the low stiffness in those systems, the natural frequency is low and the structure can move in all six degrees of freedom. Floating units serve as productions units, storage and offloading units (FSO) or for crude oil or as terminals for liquefied natural gas (LNG). A more recent development is concrete sub-sea structures.
Concrete offshore structures show an excellent performance. They are highly durable, constructed of almost maintenance-free material, suitable for harsh and/or arctic environment (like ice and seismic regions), can carry heavy topsides, often offer storage capacities, are suitable for soft grounds and are very economical for water depths larger than 150m. Most gravity-type platforms need no additional fixing because of their large foundation dimensions and extremely high weight.
Fixed structures.
Since the 1970s, several fixed concrete platform designs have been developed. Most of the designs have in common a base caisson (normally for storage of oil) and shafts penetrating the water surface to carry the topside. In the shafts normally utility systems for offloading, drilling, draw down and ballast are put up.
Concrete offshore platforms of the gravity-base type are almost always constructed in their vertical attitude. This allows the inshore installation of deck girders and equipment and the later transport of the whole structure to the installation site.
The most common concrete designs are:
Condeep Type.
Condeep refers to a make of gravity base structure for oil platforms developed and fabricated by Norwegian Contractors in Norway. Condeep usually consists of a base of concrete oil storage tanks from which one, three or four concrete shafts rise. The original Condeep always rests on the sea floor, and the shafts rise to about 30m above the sea level. The platform deck itself is not a part of the construction.
The Condeep Platforms Brent B (1975) and Brent D (1976) were designed for a water depth of 142m in the Brent oilfield operated by Shell. Their main mass is represented by the storage tank (ca. 100m diameter and 56m high, consisting of 19 cylindrical compartments with 20m diameter). Three of the cells are extended into shafts tapering off at the surface and carrying a steel deck. The tanks serve as storage of crude oil in the operation phase. During the installation these tanks have been used as ballast compartment.
Among the largest Condeep type platform are the Troll A platform and the Gullfaks C. Troll A was built within four years and deployed in 1995 to produce gas from the Troll oil field which was developed by Norske Shell, since 1996 operated by Statoil.
A detailed overview about Condeep platforms is given in a separate article.
Concrete Gravity Base Structures (CGBS) is a further development of the first-generation Condeep drilling/production platforms installed in the North Sea between the late 1970s and mid '90s. The CGBS have no oil storage facilities and the topside installations will be carried out in the field by a float-over mating method. Current or most recent projects are:
C G DORIS Type.
The first concrete gravity platform in the North Sea was a C G Doris platform, the Ekofisk Tank, in Norwegian waters.
The structure has a shape not unlike a marine sea island and is surrounded by a perforated breakwater wall (Jarlan patent).
The original proposal of the French group C G DORIS (Compagnie General pour les Developments Operationelles des Richesses Sous-Marines) for a prestressed post-tensioned concrete "island" structure was adopted on cost and operational grounds. DORIS was general contractor responsible for the structural design: the concrete design was prepared and supervised on behalf of DORIS by Europe-Etudes. Further example for the C G DORIS designs are the Frigg platforms, the Ninian Central Platform and the Schwedeneck platforms.
The design typically consists of a large volume caisson based on the sea floor merging into a monolithic structure, which is offering the base for the deck. The single main leg is surrounded by an outer breaker wall perforated with so called Jarlan holes. This wall is intended to break up waves, thus reducing their forces.
McAlpine/Sea Tank.
This desigin is quite similar to the Condeep type.
ANDOC Type.
To achieve its goal and extract oil within five years after discovering the Brent reservoir Shell
divided up the construction of four offshore platforms. Redpath Dorman Long at Methil in Fife, Scotland getting Brent A, the two concrete Condeeps B and D were to be built in Norway by Norwegian Contractors (NC) of Stavanger, and C (also concrete) was to be built by McAlpine at Ardyne Point on the Clyde (which is known as the ANDOC (Anglo Dutch Offshore Concrete) design). The ANDOC design can be considered as the British construction industry's attempt to compete with Norway in this sector. McAlpine constructed three concrete platforms for the North Sea oil industry at Ardyne Point. The ANDOC type is very similar to the Sea Tank design, but the four concrete legs terminate and steel legs take over to support the deck.
Arup Concrete Gravity Substructure (CGS).
The Arup dry-build Concrete Gravity Substructure (CGS) concept was originally developed by Arup in 1989 for Hamilton Brothers' Ravenspurn North. The Arup CGS are designed to be simple to install, and are fully removable. Simplicity and repetition of concrete structural elements, low reinforcement and pre-stress densities as well as the use of normal density concrete lead to economical construction costs. Typical for the Arup CGS is the inclined installation technique. This technique helps to maximise economy and provide a robust offshore emplacement methodology. Further projects have been the Malampaya project in the Philippines and the Wandoo Full Field Development on the North West Shelf of Western Australia.
Floating structures.
Since concrete is quite resistant to corrosion from salt water and keeps maintenance costs low, floating concrete structures have become increasingly attractive to the oil and gas industry in the last two decades. Temporary floating structures such as the Condeep platforms float during construction but are towed out and finally ballasted until they sit on the sea floor. Permanent floating concrete structures have various uses including the discovery of oil and gas deposits, in oil and gas production, as storage and offloading units and in heavy lifting systems.
Common designs for floating concrete structures are the barge or ship design, the platform design (semi-submersible, TLP) as well as the floating terminals e.g. for LNG.
Floating production, storage, and offloading systems (FPSOS) receive crude oil from deep-water wells and store it in their hull tanks until the crude is transferred into tank ships or transport barges. In addition to FPSO’s, there have been a number of ship-shaped Floating Storage and Offloading (FSO) systems (vessels with no production processing equipment) used in these same areas to support oil and gas developments. An FSO is typically used as a storage unit in remote locations far from pipelines or other infrastructures.
Semi-Submersible.
Semi-submersible marine structures are typically only movable by towing. Semi-submersible platforms have the principal characteristic of remaining in a substantially stable position, presenting small movements when they experience environmental forces such as the wind, waves and currents. Semi-Submersible platforms have pontoons and columns, typically two parallel spaced apart pontoons with buoyant columns upstanding from those pontoons to support a deck. Some of the semi-submersible vessels only have a single caisson, or column, usually denoted as a buoy while others utilize three or more columns extended upwardly from buoyant pontoons. For activities which require a stable offshore platform, the vessel is then ballasted down so that the pontoons are submerged, and only the buoyant columns pierce the water surface - thus giving the vessel a substantial buoyancy with a small water-plane area. The only concrete semi-submersible in existence is Troll B.
Tension Leg Platform (TLP).
A Tension Leg Platform is a buoyant platform, which is held in place by a mooring system. TLP mooring is different to conventional chained or wire mooring systems. The platform is held in place with large steel tendons fastened to the sea floor. Those tendons are held in tension by the buoyancy of the hull. Statoil's Heidrun TLP is the only one with a concrete hull, all other TLPs have steel hulls.
Barge/Ship Design.
FPSO or FSO systems are typically barge/ship-shaped and store crude oil in tanks located in the hull of the vessel. Their turret structures are designed to anchor the vessel, allow “weather vaning” of the units to accommodate environmental conditions, permit the constant flow of oil and production fluids from vessel to undersea field, all while being a structure capable of quick disconnect in the event of emergency.
The first barge of prestressed concrete has been designed in the early 1970s as an LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) storage barge in the Ardjuna Field (Indonesia). This barge is built of reinforced and prestressed concrete containing cylindrical tanks each having a cross-section perpendicular to its longitudinal axes that comprises a preferably circular curved portion corresponding to the bottom.

Parwich

Parwich is a village and parish in the Derbyshire Dales, located 7 miles to the north of Ashbourne. Its population is estimated at slightly over 500 inhabitants.
Village facilities include the Anglican church of St Peter's, a primary school, The Sycamore Inn (containing a public house and village shop), the village memorial hall (established in 1962 and rebuilt in 2010) the Royal British Legion club house (established 1951), a hard surfaced play area, a bowling green and a cricket pitch.
History.
Parwich is mentioned in the Domesday Book as "Pevrewic" under Derbyshire in the lands belonging to the King. The book which was written in 1086 said:
Domesday noted that Parwich together with the manors of Darley, Matlock, Wirksworth and Ashbourne and their berewicks rendered TRE 32 pounds and 6.5 sesters of honey. Now 40 pounds of pure silver.
Manor.
Parwich was part of the ancient Crown lands and after the Conquest was granted to the Ferrers, Earls of Derby. Robert de Ferrers took a prominent part in the Montford Rebellion against the king, and Edward I seized his lands. The king gave the manor to Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster and it became part of the Duchy of Lancaster held by the Cokayne family of Ashbourne Hall. In 1603 it was sold to Thomas Levinge and remained in his family until 1814 when it was sold to William Evans. The Levinge family built Parwich Hall in 1747 but were frequently absent. The son of William Evans, Sir Thomas William Evans built the present church in 1874 at a cost of £4,500. After 1892, and the estate was split between the Carrs and the Gisbornes. After World War One, the estate was sold to the Inglefields who sold it in the 1970s.
The school and church were erected by Sir Thomas William Evans in 1861 and 1873, although elements of the rebuilt church date back to Norman times and the church tympanum is thought to have pre-Norman origins.
Evans owned Parwich Hall, possibly as a summer retreat from his home in Derby. It was bought in 1814 by William Evans, Thomas's father, who was a Derbyshire MP, but was in use as a vicarage by 1841.
Governance.
Historically Parwich was a township, parish and village in the Western division of the county, part of the ancient Wirksworth hundred, and part of the Ashbourne Poor Law Union which came into existence in January 1845.
Geography.
Parwich is a village six miles north of Ashbourne. It is surrounded by fields and hills; the nearest main road is the Ashbourne to Bakewell road over a mile away; the Ashbourne to Buxton road is more than two miles away. The houses are built of local limestone and many stand around an open green, through which runs the stream which gave the village its name.

1964 Armstrong 500

The 1964 Armstrong 500 was a production car race held on 4 October 1964 at the Mount Panorama Circuit just outside Bathurst in New South Wales, Australia. The 500 mile race was open to Australian built production sedans of which 100 examples had been registered. It was the fifth Armstrong 500 and the second to be held at Bathurst although it is commonly referred to as the fifth “Bathurst 500”.
Official results reflected only class placings, with no outright winner recognized by the organizing body, the Australian Racing Drivers’ Club. The first car to complete the full 130 lap distance race was a factory backed Ford Cortina GT driven by Bob Jane and George Reynolds, the 1964 event being the fourth consecutive Armstrong 500 in which Jane had achieved an unofficial “line honours” victory.
Class structure.
Cars competed in four classes based on the purchase price of the vehicle in Australian pounds. There was little change from the 1963 race. Class A entries proliferated, taking up space on the grid from a shrinking Class B. Ford Australia had a strong presence in Class C with three factory entered Cortina GTs and Australian Motor Industries entered two Triumph 2000s in Class D.
Class A.
The up to £900 class was composed of Hillman Imp, Morris 850, NSU Prinz, Vauxhall Viva and Volkswagen Beetle.
Class B.
The £901 to £1,000 class featured Ford Cortina 1500, Morris Cooper, Renault R8 and Simca Aronde.
Class C.
The £1,001 to £1,200 class included only Ford Cortina GT and Holden EH entries.
Class D.
The £1,201 to £2,000 class featured Chrysler Valiant, Citroën ID19, Ford Zephyr, Humber Vogue Sports, Holden EH Premier, Studebaker Lark, Triumph 2000 and Vauxhall Velox.
Race.
While the V8 powered Studebaker Larks again led early, fragile brakes saw them overtaken by the leading Cortinas as the race wore on. The Cortina driven by the Geoghegan brothers fell from the mid-race lead after a generator bracket broke, allowing teammates Jane and Reynolds into the race lead they would not relinquish. Barry Seton and Herb Taylor finished second ahead of Jane's former partner Harry Firth co-driving the third factory Ford with John Reaburn. In the other three classes, the early leaders each retained their leads throughout the day. Bert Needham and Warren Weldon brought their Class D winning Studebaker home as fourth car across the line, two laps down on Jane/Reynolds and a lap behind Firth/Reaburn. Charlie Smith and Bruce Maher won Class B, leading home a 1-2-3-4 for Morris Cooper ahead of four Renault R8s. Smith/Maher finished just six laps behind the Cortina GTs. Class A was dominated by Vauxhall, with the Viva of Spencer Martin and Bill Brown leading home five other examples. Seven cars failed to finish the event, with another being disqualified.
Results.
As follows:
The Team Prize was won by the three Ford Motor Co entered Ford Cortina GTs driven by Jane/Reynolds, Seton/Taylor and Firth/Raeburn.

Pepe Sánchez (trova)

Pepe Sánchez, born José Sánchez (Santiago de Cuba, 19 March 1856 – 3 January 1918), was a Cuban musician, singer and composer. He is known as the father of the "trova" style and the creator of the Cuban bolero. 
Sánchez was originally a tailor, and later the co-owner of a copper mine, and the representative in Santiago de Cuba of a cloth manufacturer in Kingston, Jamaica. He moved in upper and middle class circles in Santiago despite being a mulatto; his work as a businessman and musician brought him recognition and acceptance. 
Pepe had some experience in "bufo" theatre, but had no formal training in music. With remarkable natural talent, he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost for ever, though some two dozen or so survive because friends and disciples wrote them down. His first bolero, "Tristezas", is still remembered today. He also created advertisement jingles before radio was born. He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed him: Sindo Garay, Rosendo Ruiz, Manuel Corona and Alberto Villalón. 
Other works of note are "Pobre artista", "Rosa" I, II and III, "Cuando oí la expressión de tu canto", "Cuba, mi patria querida", "Caridad", "Esperanza", "Naturaleza" and "Himno a Maceo".
There is one modern recording of his music:

Cheltenham Literature Festival

The Times Cheltenham Literature Festival, a large-scale international festival of literature in the Spa town of Cheltenham, and part of Cheltenham Festivals: also responsible for the Jazz, Music and Science Festivals that run every year.
Introduction and history.
Formed in 1949, "The Cheltenham Literature Festival" is the longest-running festival of its kind in the world. The Festival was started by the Spa Manager George Wilkinson, in conjunction with the Tewkesbury-based author John Moore, who served as its first director. Actor Ralph Richardson, who was born in Cheltenham, launched the festival, and poet Cecil Day Lewis, who taught at Cheltenham College, read a selection of contemporary verse. The Festival currently has the national newspaper 'The Times' as its 'title' sponsor: therefore making the full name of the festival "The Times Cheltenham Literature Festival".

Consort Dugu

Consort Dugu, imperial consort rank Guifei (獨孤貴妃, personal name unknown) (died November 3, 775), formally Empress Zhenyi (貞懿皇后, literally "the virtuous and kind empress"), was an imperial consort of the Chinese Tang Dynasty, during the reign of Emperor Daizong (Li Chu). She was Emperor Daizong's favorite concubine and, while she never became empress in her lifetime, she dominated inside the palace. He posthumously honored her as empress after her death in 775.
Background.
It is not known when the future Consort Dugu was born, or where her family was from. Her father Dugu Ying (獨孤穎) was an officer in the imperial guard corps. She became a concubine of Li Chu, then the Prince of Guangping under his father Emperor Suzong, in or shortly after 757, when his then-dominant consort Consort Wei died. It was said that she was exceedingly beautiful and drew his favor to the exclusion of all other consorts, and that after her entry into the palace, the other consorts were rarely able to have sexual relations with him.
As imperial consort.
After Li Chu, whose name had been changed to Li Yu by that point, became emperor in 762 (as Emperor Daizong), Consort Dugu was created the imperial consort rank of "Guifei" (貴妃) in 768 -- the highest rank among imperial consorts, but was not created empress, and it was said that it was for her that Emperor Daizong never created anyone else empress. (The modern Chinese historian Bo Yang suggested that the reason was that Emperor Daizong did not want to endanger the position of his oldest son Li Kuo, who had been created crown prince.)
Consort Dugu bore Emperor Daizong two children -- Li Jiong (李迥), who was created the Prince of Han in 762 due to the favor that Consort Dugu was enjoying while most of his other brothers were not created imperial princes until 775, and Princess Huayang, who was herself said to be favored by Emperor Daizong greatly due to her intelligence and her ability to discern his likes and dislikes. When Princess Huayang died in 774, he was so greatly saddened that he did not attend imperial meetings for several days until the chancellors asked the eunuch Wu Chengqian (吳承倩) to persuade him to attend to government matters. It was later rumored that the important minister Liu Yan had tried to persuade Emperor Daizong to create Consort Dugu empress, but failed to convince Emperor Daizong. He honored her family great -- posthumously honoring her father Dugu Ying, and also granting honorific offices to her uncle Dugu Zhuo (獨孤卓) and her brother Dugu Liangzuo (獨孤良佐).
Death.
Consort Dugu died in 775. The day after her death, Emperor Daizong posthumously honored her as empress. Greatly saddened by her death, he placed her casket within the palace for years, until he finally buried her on September 19, 778, at the imperial tomb where he would eventually be buried himself. As Princess Huayang had previously been buried at a site that was considered to be too low-lying and wet, he also had Princess Huayang disinterred and reburied near Consort Dugu. He had the chancellor Chang Gun, known for his literary talent, write a lengthy text mourning her.

Publius Licinius Crassus (son of triumvir)

Publius Licinius Crassus (86?/82? BC – 53 BC) was one of two sons of Marcus Licinius Crassus, the so-called "triumvir", and Tertulla. He belonged to the last generation of Roman "nobiles" who came of age and began a political career before the collapse of the Republic. His peers included Marcus Antonius, Marcus Junius Brutus, Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, the poet Gaius Valerius Catullus, and the historian Gaius Sallustius Crispus.
Publius Crassus served under Julius Caesar in Gaul from 58 to 56 BC. Too young to receive a formal commission from the senate, Publius distinguished himself as a commanding officer in campaigns among the Armorican nations (Brittany) and in Aquitania. He was highly regarded by Caesar and also by Cicero, who praised his speaking ability and good character. Upon his return to Rome, Publius married Cornelia Metella, the intellectually gifted daughter of the optimate Metellus Scipio, and began his active political career as a "monetalis" and by providing a security force during his father's campaign for a second consulship.
Publius’s promising career was cut short when he died along with his father in an ill-conceived war against the Parthian Empire. Cornelia, with whom he probably had no children, then married the much older Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great").
Early life.
Scholarly opinion is divided as to whether Publius or his brother Marcus was the elder, but with Roman naming conventions, the eldest son almost always carries on his father's name, including the praenomen, or first name, while younger sons are named for a grandfather or uncle. The achievements of Publius, named after his grandfather (consul in 97 BC) and uncle, eclipse those of his brother to such an extent that some have questioned the traditional birth order. Both Ronald Syme and Elizabeth Rawson, however, have argued vigorously for a family dynamic that casts Marcus as the older but Publius as the more talented younger brother.
Family environment.
Publius grew up in a traditional household that was characterized by Plutarch in his "Life of Crassus" as stable and orderly. The biographer is often harshly critical of the elder Crassus's shortcomings, particularly moralizing his greed, but makes a point of contrasting the triumvir's family life. Despite his great wealth, Crassus is said to have avoided excess and luxury at home. Family meals were simple, and entertaining was generous but not ostentatious; Crassus chose his companions during leisure hours on the basis of personal friendship as well as political utility. Although the Crassi, as noble plebeians, would have displayed ancestral images in their atrium, they did not lay claim to a fictionalized genealogy that presumed divine or legendary ancestors, a practice not uncommon among the Roman nobility. The elder Crassus, even as the son of a consul and censor, had himself grown up in a modestly kept and multigenerational house; the passage of sumptuary laws had been among his father's political achievements.
In marrying the widow of his brother, who had been killed during the Sullan civil wars, Marcus Crassus observed an ancient Roman custom that had become old-fashioned in his own time. Publius, unlike many of his peers, had parents who remained married for nearly 35 years, until the elder Crassus's death; by contrast, Pompeius Magnus married five times and Julius Caesar at least three. Crassus remained married to Tertulla "despite attacks on her reputation." It was rumored that a family friend, Quintus Axius of Reate, was the biological father of one of her two sons. Plutarch reports a joke by Cicero that made reference to a strong resemblance between Axius and one of the boys.
Education.
The Peripatetic philosopher Alexander was attached to the household of Crassus and is likely to have contributed to the education of the boys. Although his poor remuneration is noted as evidence of Crassus’s parsimony, it has been suggested that in failing to enrich himself at Crassus's expense Alexander asserted a positive philosophical stance disregarding material possessions. The Peripatetics of the time differed little from the Old Academy represented by Antiochus of Ascalon, who placed emphasis on knowledge as the supreme value and on the Aristotelian conception of human beings as by nature political (a "zōon politikon", "creature of politics"). This view of man as a "political animal" would have been congenial to the family political dynamism of the Licinii Crassi.
The Peripatetics and Academics, according to Cicero, provided the best oratorical training; while the Academics drilled in rebuttal, he says, the Peripatetics excelled at rhetorical theory and also practiced debating both sides of an issue. The young Crassus must have thrived on this training, for Cicero praises his abilities as a speaker and in the "Brutus" places him in the company of gifted young orators whose lives ended before they could fulfill their potential:
The secondary education of a Roman male of the governing classes typically required a stint as a "contubernalis" (literally a “tentmate”, a sort of military intern or apprentice) following the assumption of the "toga virilis" around the age of 15 and before assuming formal military duties. Publius, his brother Marcus, and Decimus Brutus may have been "contubernales" during Caesar's propraetorship in Spain (61–60 BC). Publius’s father and grandfather had strong ties to Spain: his grandfather had earned his triumph from the same province of Hispania Ulterior, and during Sulla's first civil war his father had found refuge among friends there, avoiding the fate of Publius's uncle and grandfather. Caesar’s field commission of Publius in Gaul indicates a high level of confidence, perhaps because he had trained the young man himself and knew his abilities.
Little else is known about Publius's philosophical predispositions or political sympathies. Despite his active support on behalf of his father in the elections for 55 BC and his ties to Caesar, he admired and was loyal to Cicero and played a mediating role between Cicero and the elder Crassus, who was often at odds with the outspoken orator. In his friendship with Cicero, Publius showed a degree of political independence. Cicero seems to have hoped that he could steer the talented young man away from a popularist and militarist path toward the example of his consular grandfather, whose political career was traditional and moderate, or toward modeling himself after the orator Licinius Crassus about whom Cicero so often wrote. Cicero almost always speaks of young Crassus with approval and affection, criticizing only his impatient ambition.
Early military career.
Publius Crassus enters the historical record as an officer under Caesar in Gaul. His military rank, which Caesar never identifies, has been a subject of debate. Although he held commands, Publius was neither an elected military tribune nor "legatus" appointed by the senate, though the Greek historian Cassius Dio contributes to the confusion by applying Greek terminology (ὑπεστρατήγει, "hupestratêgei") to Publius that usually translates the rank expressed in Latin by "legatus". Those who have argued that Publius was the elder son have attempted to make a quaestor of him. Caesar's omission, however, supports the view that the young Crassus held no formal rank, as the "Bellum Gallicum" consistently identifies officers with regard to their place in the military chain of command. Publius is introduced in the narrative only as "adulescens", “tantamount to a technical term for a young man not holding any formal post.” The only other Roman Caesar calls "adulescens" is Decimus Brutus, who also makes his first appearance in history in the "Bellum Gallicum". In the third year of the war, Caesar refers to Publius as "dux", a non-technical term of military leadership that he uses elsewhere only in reference to Celtic generals. The informality of the phrase is enhanced by a descriptive "adulescentulus"; in context, Publius is said to be with his men as an "adulescentulo duce", their "very young" or "under-age leader."
Entering Celtica, 58 BC.
In the first year of the Gallic Wars, Caesar and his Celtic Aeduan allies fought a defensive campaign against the Celtic Helvetii, and waged an offensive against the Germanic Suebi and their allies, led by Ariovistus. During the decisive battle against the Suebi that brought the first year of fighting to its conclusion, Publius Crassus was given command of the cavalry. In 58 BC, Caesar’s cavalry auxiliaries numbered 4,000, comprising regiments from the Aedui and from the Gallic nations of Gallia Transalpina, already a Roman province. In Caesar’s army, the primary strategic applications of cavalry were reconnaissance and intelligence gathering, conducted by detachments of "exploratores" (“scouts”) and "speculatores" (“spies”); communications; patrols, including advance parties and guard units on the flanks of the army on the march; skirmishing, and securing the territory after fighting by preventing the flight of surviving enemy. The cavalry charge was infrequent. In the opening stage of the war against the Helvetii, Caesar had retained a Gallic command structure; a lack of strategic coordination, exacerbated by conflicting loyalties, led to poor performance, which Caesar sought to correct with a more centralized command. Publius Crassus is the first Roman named as a cavalry commander in the war, and was perhaps given the task of restructuring.
After several days of Roman provocation that produced only skirmishes, the Suebi responded with a sudden attack that preempted standard Roman tactics; Caesar says that the army was unable to release a volley of javelins ("pila"), which ordinarily would have been preceded by a cavalry skirmish. Instead, Crassus and the auxiliaries seem to have remained on the periphery of action. Caesar gives Crassus credit for accurately assessing the status of the battle from his superior vantage point and for ordering in the third line of infantry at the critical moment. Initiative is implied. After the Suebi were routed, the horsemen pursued those who escaped, but failed to capture Ariovistus.
Belgica, 57 BC.
The second year of the war was conducted in northern Gaul among the Belgic nations. In the penultimate chapter of his book on that year’s campaigns, Caesar abruptly reveals that he had placed Publius Crassus in command of the 7th Legion, which had suffered heavy casualties against the Nervii at the recent Battle of the Sabis; Publius's role in this battle goes unremarked. Caesar says that in the aftermath he sent Crassus west to Armorica (Brittany) while he himself headed east to lay siege to the stronghold of the Aduatuci.
Armorica and Aquitania, 56 BC.
Scholars have rarely tried to interpret Caesar's decision to send a young, relatively inexperienced officer with a single legion to secure a major geographical region inhabited by multiple "civitates", while the commander-in-chief himself lay siege to a single town with the remaining seven legions of his army and a full staff of senior legates and some or most of the tribunes. Crassus’s Armorican mission is reported so elliptically that Caesar’s chronology and veracity have been questioned, most pointedly by the contrarian scholar Michel Rambaud, who insisted that the 7th Legion must have detached for its mission prior to the Battle of the Sabis. Crassus is credited with bringing several polities or “nations” under treaty, but Caesar says nothing about military operations:
Crassus and the 7th then winter among the Andes, a Gallic polity whose territory corresponds roughly with the diocese of Angers (Anjou) in the French department Maine-et-Loire. Although Caesar locates the Andes “near the Atlantic,” they held no coast and were located inland along the Loire river.
Caesar is compelled to modify his assessment of the situation when he writes his account of the third year of the war, in which he himself plays a diminished role and which is markedly shorter than his other six books. Instead, Book 3 of the "Bellum Gallicum" focuses on Sulpicius Galba’s travails in the Alps, and campaigns led by the two junior officers Publius Crassus and Decimus Brutus.
Hostage crisis.
According to Caesar, the young Crassus, facing a shortage of rations, at some unspecified time sent out detachments to procure grain under the command of prefects and military tribunes, among them four named officers of equestrian status who are seized as hostages by three Gallic polities in collusion. The four are T. Terrasidius, held by the Esubii; M. Trebius Gallus, by the Coriosolites; and Q. Velanius and T. Silius, both by the Veneti.
Whether the Gauls and the Romans understood each other’s laws and customs pertaining to hostage-taking is at issue here as elsewhere in the course of the war, and the actions of Publius Crassus are difficult to reconstruct. The Latin word for hostage, (plural ), may translate but not necessarily correspond in legal application with the Celtic "congestlos" (in Gaulish). For both Romans and Celts, the handing over of hostages was often a formally negotiated term in a treaty; among the Celts, however, hostages were also exchanged as a pledge of mutual alliance with no loss of status, a practice that should be placed in the context of other Celtic social institutions such as fosterage and political alliance through marriage. Among the Celtic and Germanic peoples, hostage arrangements seem to have been a more mutually effective form of diplomatic pressure than was the always-onesided taking of hostages by the Romans.
A concept of international law, expressed in Latin by the phrase "ius gentium," existed by custom and consensus, and not in any written code or sworn treaty. By custom, the safety of hostages was guaranteed unless parties to a treaty violated its terms, in which case the subjecting of hostages to punitive actions such as torture or execution was not regarded as violating the "ius gentium". If the Armoricans believed themselves to hold the four Romans as hostages in the sense of "congestloi", it is unclear what negotiations Publius Crassus had undertaken. “Caesar liked energy and enterprise in young aristocrats,” Syme remarked, “a predilection not always attended with happy results.” Caesar reacted with military force.
In writing the "Bellum Gallicum", Caesar often elides legal and administrative arrangements in favor of military narrative. The situation faced by Publius Crassus in Brittany involved both the prosaic matter of logistics (i.e., feeding the legion under his command) as well as diplomacy among multiple polities, much of which had to be conducted on initiative during Caesar's absence. The building of a Roman fleet on the Loire river during the winter of 57–56 BC has been interpreted by several modern scholars as preparation for an invasion of Britain, to which the Armoricans would have objected as a threat to their own trade relations with the island. Caesar, at any rate, is most expansive about the exciting naval battle that ensues from the crisis.
When he received reports of the hostage situation in Armorica, Caesar had not yet returned to the front from his administrative winter quarters in Ravenna, where he had met with Publius’s father for political deal-making prior to the more famous triumviral conference at Luca in April. Caesar makes haste, and in the summer of 56 BC, the campaign against the Veneti and their allies is conducted by Decimus Brutus as a naval operation. Caesar gives no explanation for transferring Crassus from command on the Armorican front. The Romans are eventually victorious, but the fate of the hostages is left unstated, and in a break with his policy in working with the Gallic aristocracy over the previous two years, Caesar orders the execution of the entire Venetian senate.
Conqueror of Aquitania.
While naval operations were taking place in the waters of the Veneti, Publius Crassus was sent south to Aquitania, this time with a force consisting of twelve Roman legionary cohorts, allied Celtic cavalry and volunteers from Gallia Narbonensis. Ten cohorts is the standard complement of the Caesarian legion, and the twelve cohorts are not identified by any unit number. Caesar relates Publius’s challenges and successes at some length and without any ambiguity about their military nature. Cassius Dio provides a synopsis, which does not accord in every detail with the account of Caesar:
Caesar regards the victories of Publius Crassus as impressive for several reasons. Crassus was only about 25 at the time. He was greatly outnumbered, but he recruited both new Celtic allies and called up provincial forces from southern Gaul; a thousand of his Celtic cavalry remain under his command and loyal to him till his death. Caesar seems almost to present a military résumé for Crassus that outlines the qualities of a good officer. The young "dux" successfully brought the power of war machines to bear in laying siege to a stronghold of the Sotiates; upon surrender, he showed clemency, a quality on which Caesar prided himself, toward the enemy commander Adcantuannus. Crassus solicited opinions from his officers at a war council and achieved consensus on a plan of action. He gathered intelligence and demonstrated his foresight and strategic thinking, employing tactics of stealth, surprise, and deception. Caesar further makes a point of Crassus's attention to logistics and supply lines, which may have been a deficiency on the Armorican mission. Ultimately, Crassus was able to out-general experienced men who had trained in Roman military tactics with the gifted rebel Quintus Sertorius on the Spanish front of the civil wars in the late 80s and 70s BC.
Political career.
Publius Crassus returned to Rome in the fall of 56 BC, or as late as January 55 BC. He brought with him a thousand troops from Gaul, the presence of which had a noticeable effect on the consular elections for the coming year. Street violence was increasingly an instrument of political pressure, culminating three years later in the public murder of the popularist aristocrat Publius Clodius Pulcher. Pompeius Magnus and Marcus Crassus were eventually elected to their second joint consulship for the year of 55. Several steps were taken during this time to advance Publius's career.
"Monetalis".
Publius Crassus served as one of the "monetales," or moneyers, authorized to issue coinage, most likely in the year of his father’s consulship. In the late Republic, this office was a regular preliminary to the political career track for senators’ sons, to be followed by a run for quaestor when the age requirement of 30 was met.
Common among the surviving coins issued by Publius Crassus is a denarius depicting a bust of Venus, perhaps a reference to Caesar's legendary genealogy, and on the reverse an unidentified female figure standing by a horse. The short-skirted equestrian holds the horse's bridle in her right hand, with a spear in her left. A cuirass and shield appear in the background at her feet. She may be an allegorical representation of "Gallia", to commemorate Crassus's military achievements in Gaul and to honor the thousand Gallic cavalry who were deployed with him for Syria.
Augur.
Publius received an additional boost to his career when he was co-opted into the college of augurs, replacing the late Lucius Licinius Lucullus, a staunch conservative in politics. Although the augurs held no direct political power, their right to withhold religious ratification could amount to a veto. It was a prestigious appointment that indicates great expectations for Publius’s future. The vacancy left in the augural college by Publius’s premature death only two years later was filled by Cicero.
Marriage.
During his time in Rome, Publius married the lavishly praised and highly educated Cornelia, who was probably around sixteen or seventeen. As the daughter of Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio, she was “the heiress of the last surviving branch of the Scipiones.” Publius would have been in his late twenties. His military service abroad had postponed marriage to a later age than a Roman noble typically took a wife. The date of their betrothal goes unrecorded, but if Cornelia had long been the desired bride, she would have been too young to marry before Publius left for Gaul, and his worth as a husband may not have been as evident. The political value of the marriage for Publius lay in family ties to the so-called optimates, a continually realigning faction of conservative senators who sought to preserve the traditional prerogatives of the aristocratic oligarchy and to prevent exceptional individuals from dominating through direct appeal to the people or the amassing of military power. Publius’s brother had been married to a daughter of Q. Caecilius Metellus Creticus (consul 69 BC), probably around 63–62 BC; both matches signal their father’s desire for rapprochement with the optimates, despite his working arrangements with Caesar and Pompeius, an indication that perhaps the elder Crassus was more conservative than some have thought.
Preparations for the East.
In a letter from February 55 BC, Cicero mentions the presence of Publius Crassus at a meeting held at his father’s house. During these political negotiations, it was agreed that Cicero would not oppose a "legatio", or state-sponsored junket, to the East by his longtime enemy Clodius Pulcher, in exchange for Marcus Crassus supporting an unidentified favor sought by Cicero. Although Clodius has sometimes been regarded as an agent or ally of Crassus, it is unclear whether his trip, probably to visit Byzantium or Galatia, was connected to Crassus’s own intentions in the East.
The triumviral negotiations at Ravenna and Luca had resulted in the prolongment of Caesar's Gallic command and the granting of an extended five-year proconsular province for each of the consuls of 55 BC. The Spanish provinces went to Pompeius; Crassus arranged to have Syria, with the transparent intention of launching a war against Parthia. Some Romans opposed the war. Cicero calls it a war "nulla causa" (“with no justification”), on the grounds that Parthia had a treaty with Rome. Others may have objected less to a war with Parthia than to the attempt of the triumvirate to amass power by waging it. Despite objections and a host of bad omens, Marcus Crassus set sail from Brundisium in November 55 BC.
The notoriously wealthy Marcus Crassus was around sixty and hearing-impaired when he embarked on the Parthian invasion. Plutarch in particular regards greed as his motive; modern historians tend toward envy and rivalry, since Crassus’ faded military reputation was inferior to that of Pompeius and, after five years of war in Gaul, to that of Caesar. Elizabeth Rawson, however, suggested that in addition to these or other practical objectives, the war was meant to provide an arena for Publius’s abilities as a general, which he had begun to demonstrate so vividly in Gaul. Cicero implies as much when he enumerates Publius's many fine qualities (see above) and then mourns and criticizes his young friend's destructive desire for "gloria":
Publius presumably helped with preparations for the war. Both Pompeius and Crassus levied troops throughout Italy. Publius may have organized these efforts in the north, as he is said to have departed for Parthia from Gaul (probably Cisalpina). His thousand cavalry from Celtica (present-day France and Belgium), "auxilia" provided by technically independent allies, were likely to have been stationed in Cisalpina; it is questionable whether the thousand-strong force he used to pressure elections in January 55 BC were these same men, as the employment of barbarians within Rome should have been viewed as outrageous enough to provoke comment.
Publius's activities in 54 BC are unrecorded, but he and his Celtic cavalry troopers did not join his father in Syria until the winter of 54–53 BC, a year after the elder Crassus's departure. His horsemen may have been needed in Gaul as Caesar dealt with a renewed threat from Germanic tribes from across the Rhine and launched his first invasion of Britannia.
The Parthian campaign.
Despite opposition to the war, Marcus Crassus was criticized for doing little to advance the invasion during the first year of his proconsulship. Upon entering winter quarters, he spent his time on the 1st-century BC equivalent of number-crunching and wealth management, rather than organizing his troops and engaging in diplomatic efforts to gain allies. Only after the arrival of Publius Crassus did he launch the war, and even that beginning was ill-omened. After an inventory of the treasury at the Temple of Atargatis, Hierapolis, Publius stumbled at the gate and his father tripped over him. The reporting of this portent, fictional or not, suggests "that Publius was seen as the true cause of the disaster."
The military advance was likewise attended by a series of bad omens, and the elder Crassus was frequently at odds with his quaestor, Cassius Longinus, the future assassin of Caesar. Cassius's strategic sense is presented by Plutarch as superior to that of his commander. Little is said of any contribution by Publius Crassus until a critical juncture at the river Balissus (Balikh), where most of the officers thought the army ought to make camp, rest after a long march through hostile terrain, and reconnoiter. Marcus Crassus instead is inspired by the eagerness of Publius and his Celtic cavalry to do battle, and after a quick halt in ranks for refreshment, the army marches headlong into a Parthian trap.
Marcus Crassus commanded seven legions, the strength of which has been estimated variously from 28,000 to 40,000, along with 4,000 cavalry and a comparable number of light infantry. The Roman army vastly outnumbered the force they faced. Although the sandy, open desert landscape favored cavalry over infantry, the primary value of the Gallo-Roman cavalry was mobility, not force, being lightly armed and protected. By contrast, the one thousand heavily armored Parthian cataphracts rode barded horses and carried long heavy lances ("kontos"), the reach and power of which exceeded the Gallic spear, while the 9,000 Parthian mounted archers were equipped with a compound bow far superior to that used in Europe, with arrows continually replenished by foot soldiers from a camel train. The reputation of the legionaries for excellence in combat at close quarters had been anticipated by the brilliant Parthian general Surena, and answered with heavy cavalry and long-range weaponry.
Marcus Crassus responded by drawing the legionaries into a defensive square, the shield-wall of which afforded some protection but within which they could accomplish nothing and risked being surrounded. To prevent encirclement, or perhaps in a desperate attempt at diversion, Publius Crassus led out a corps of 1,300 cavalry, primarily his loyal Celtic troopers; 500 archers; and 4,000 elite infantry. The Parthian wing on his side, appearing to abandon their attempt to surround the army, then retreated. Publius pursued. When his force was out of visual and communication range of the main army, the Parthians halted, and Publius found himself in an ambush, with his force rapidly encircled. A military historian describes the scene:
With casualties mounting, Publius decided that a charge was his only option, but most of his men, riddled with arrows, could not respond to the call. Only the Gallic cavalry followed their young leader. The cataphracts returned the effort with a counter charge in which they held the distinct advantage in number and equipment. The weaker, shorter Gallic spears would have had limited effect against the heavy encasing armor of the cataphracts. But when the two forces closed, the lighter armor that left the Gauls more vulnerable also made them more agile. They grabbed hold of the Parthian lances and grappled to unseat the enemy horsemen. Other Gauls, unhorsed or choosing to dismount, stabbed the Parthian horses in the belly — a tactic that had been employed against Caesar's cavalry by outnumbered Germans the previous year in Gaul.
Eventually, however, the Gauls are forced to retreat, carrying away their wounded leader to a nearby sand dune, where the surviving Roman forces regroup. They drive their horses into the center, then lock shields to form a perimeter. But because of the slope, the men were exposed in tiers to the ceaseless volleys of arrows. Two Greeks who knew the region tried to persuade Publius to escape to a nearby friendly city while his troops held off the enemy. He refused:
The portrait of Publius in Parthia presented by Plutarch contrasts with Caesar's emphasis on the young man's prudence, diplomacy, and strategic thinking. Plutarch describes a leader who is above all keen to fight, brave to the point of recklessness, and tragically heroic in his embrace of death.
Publius Crassus's friends Censorinus and Megabocchus and most of the officers commit suicide next to him, and barely 500 men are left alive. The Parthians mutilate Publius’s body and parade his head on the tip of a lance in front of the Roman camp. Taunts are hurled at his father for his son’s greater courage. Plutarch suggests that Marcus Crassus was unable to recover from this psychological blow, and the military situation deteriorated rapidly as a result of his failing leadership. Most of the Roman army was killed or enslaved, except for about 10,000 led by or eventually reunited with Cassius, whose escape has sometimes been characterized as a desertion. It was one of the worst military disasters in Roman history.
Legacy.
The civil war between Caesar and Pompeius is often said to have been made inevitable by the deaths of two people: Caesar's daughter Julia, whose political marriage to Pompeius surprised Roman social circles by its affection; and Marcus Crassus, whose political influence and wealth had been a counterweight to the two greater militarists. It would be idle to speculate on what role Publius Crassus might have played either in the civil war or during Caesar's resulting dictatorship. In many ways, his career follows a course similar to the early life of Decimus Brutus, whose role in the assassination of Caesar was far from foreseeable. Elizabeth Rawson concludes:
At the time of his assassination, Caesar was planning a war against Parthia in retaliation for Carrhae. Marcus Antonius made the attempt, but suffered another defeat by the Parthians. The lost standards of the Roman army were finally restored by Augustus.
Cornelia as widow.
Plutarch has Cornelia claim that she tried to kill herself upon learning of her young husband's death. Since Roman widows were not expected to display suicidal grief, Plutarch's dramatization may suggest the depth of Cornelia's emotion at the loss. She is unlikely to have been more than twenty years old at the time. The marriage seems to have produced no children, though Syme speculated about “an unknown daughter.”
As a young and desirable widow, Cornelia then married Pompeius Magnus the following year, becoming his fifth and final wife. Pompeius was more than thirty years her senior. Swift remarriage was not unusual, and perhaps even customary, for aristocratic Romans after the death of a spouse. Despite the age difference, which met with disapproval, this marriage too was said to be affectionate, even passionate. Cornelia was widowed a second time when Pompeius was killed and beheaded in Egypt during the civil war.
In Roman literature, Cornelia becomes almost the type of the gifted woman whose life is delimited by the tragic ambitions of her husbands. In his "Life of Pompey", Plutarch has her blame the weight of her own "daimon", heavy with the death of Crassus, for Pompeius's change in fortune. Susan Treggiari remarks that Plutarch's portrayal of the couple “is not to be sharply distinguished from that of star-crossed lovers elsewhere in poetry.” Lucan dramatizes the couple's fateful romance to an extreme in his often satiric epic "Bellum Civile", where throughout Book 5 Cornelia becomes emblematic of the Late Republic itself, of its greatness and ruin by its most talented men.
(P. Licinius?) Apollonius.
A lost biography of Publius Crassus was written by his Greek secretary Apollonius, who accompanied him on the Parthian campaign but presumably escaped with Cassius. Eight years after the battle, Cicero wrote a letter of recommendation to Caesar on behalf of Apollonius, praising him for his loyalty. Since he was manumitted as a term of Publius's will, he is by Roman custom likely to have taken the name Publius Licinius Apollonius as a freedman. The highly laudatory account of Publius's death found in Plutarch suggests that Apollonius's biography was a source.
Marcus, surviving brother.
Publius's surviving brother, Marcus, went to Gaul as Caesar's quaestor in 54 BC, the year before the Parthian defeat. His service record is undistinguished. In 49 BC, Caesar as dictator appointed Marcus governor of Cisalpine Gaul, the ethnically Celtic north of Italy. He appears to have remained a loyal partisan of Caesar. The Augustan historian Pompeius Trogus, of the Celtic Vocontii, said that the Parthians feared especially harsh retribution in any war won against them by Caesar, because the surviving son of Crassus would be among the Roman forces.
His son, also named Marcus, resembled his uncle Publius in the scope of his military talent and ambition, and was not afraid to assert himself under the hegemony of Augustus. This Marcus (consul 30 BC), called by Syme an “illustrious renegade,” was to be the last Roman outside the imperial family to earn a triumph from the senate.
In literature.
Historians consistently record the death of Publius along with that of his far more famous father. Latin poets who allude to the infamous military disaster often speak of the "Crassi", plural. Ovid notes that Augustus built the Temple of Mars Ultor ("Mars the Avenger") to fulfill a vow made to the god if he would help avenge Caesar's murder and the Roman loss at Carrhae, where the "Crassorum funera" ("deaths of the Crassi") had enhanced the Parthians' sense of superiority. Eutropius, four centuries after the fact, takes note of Publius as “a most illustrious and outstanding young man.”
As author?
The geographer Strabo refers to a treatise on the Cassiterides, the semi-legendary Tin Islands off the coast of Britain, written by a Publius Crassus but not now extant. Several scholars of the 19th and early 20th centuries, including Theodor Mommsen and T. Rice Holmes, thought that this prose work resulted from an expedition during Publius's occupation of Armorica. Scholars of the 20th and early 21st centuries have been more inclined to assign authorship to the grandfather, during his proconsulship in Spain in the 90s BC, in which case Publius's Armorican mission may have been prompted in part by business interests and a desire to capitalize on the earlier survey of resources.

Lipstick on a pig

To put "lipstick on a pig" is a rhetorical expression, used to convey the message that making superficial or cosmetic changes is a futile attempt to disguise the true nature of a product.
Etymology.
Pigs have long featured in proverbial expressions: a "pig's ear," a "pig in a poke," as well as the Biblical expressions "" and "ring of gold in a swine's snout." Indeed, whereas the phrase "lipstick on a pig" seems to have been coined in the 20th century, the concept of the phrase may not be particularly recent. The similar expression, "You can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear" seems to have been in use by the middle of the 16th century or earlier. Thomas Fuller, the British physician, noted the use of the phrase "A hog in armour is still but a hog" in 1732, here, as the "Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue" (1796) later noted "hog in armour" alludes to "an awkward or mean looking man or woman, finely dressed." The Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon (1834–1892) recorded the variation "A hog in a silk waistcoat is still a hog" in his book of proverbs "The Salt-Cellars" (published 1887).
The "lipstick" variant of the phrase is more modern (the word "lipstick" itself was only coined in 1880). The rhetorical effect of linking pigs with lipstick was explored in 1926 by Charles F. Lummis, in the "Los Angeles Times," when he wrote "Most of us know as much of history as a pig does of lipsticks." However, the first recorded uses of "putting lipstick on a pig" are later. In Stella Gibbons' 'Westwood' (published 1946) Hebe visits a hair salon and has her hair "contemptuously washed by Miss Susan, who had a face like a very young pig that had managed to get hold of a lipstick"
In an article in the "Quad-City Herald" (Brewster, Washington) from Jan. 31 1980, it was observed that "You can clean up a pig, put a ribbon on it's tail, spray it with perfume, but it is still a pig." The phrase was also reported in 1985 when "The Washington Post" quoted a San Francisco radio host from KNBR-AM remarking "That would be like putting lipstick on a pig" in reference to plans to refurbish Candlestick Park (rather than constructing a new stadium for the San Francisco Giants).
Contemporary usage.
In May 2002, brokerage firm Charles Schwab Corporation ran a television advertisement pointing out Wall Street brokerage firms' conflicts of interest by showing an unidentified sales manager telling his salesmen, "Let's put some lipstick on this pig!" The ad appeared shortly after New York's Attorney General Eliot Spitzer announced that Merrill Lynch stock analysts had recommended stocks that they privately called "dogs." CBS refused to air the ad.
More recently, the phrase has been used in political rhetoric to criticize spin, and to insinuate that a political opponent is attempting to repackage established policies and present them as new. Victoria Clarke, who was Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs under Donald Rumsfeld, published a book about spin in politics titled "Lipstick on a Pig: Winning In the No-Spin Era by Someone Who Knows the Game". The book argued, using anecdotes from her own career, that spin does not work in an age of transparency, when everyone will find out the truth anyway ("you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig").
In recent years the phrase has become common and often controversial political invective both in the United Kingdom and the United States. The expression has been used by many US politicians, including both the Democratic nominee Barack Obama and Republican nominee John McCain during the United States Presidential Election of 2008, and Vice President Dick Cheney(who called it his "favorite line").

<doc id="19261147" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19261147" title="Major League Baseball tie-breaking procedures">
Major League Baseball tie-breaking procedures

Because inclusion in the Major League Baseball postseason is based upon the teams' regular-season records, procedures exist to break ties between teams.
In common parlance, the Major League Baseball postseason is described as "the playoffs", for consistency with the nomenclature of other professional leagues (i.e. NFL Playoffs, NBA Playoffs, etc.). However, the term "playoff" is only used by Major League Baseball to describe tie-breaking games that determine postseason berths. Games after the regular season are officially referred to as "postseason" games.
Ties between two teams.
Two-way tie for the division or wildcard.
One-game tiebreakers are played between teams tied for a division championship or a league's second wildcard berth. These games are to be played the day after the season is scheduled to end. Home-field advantage is determined using the rules listed below ("Breaking Ties Without Playoff Games").
From the implementation of the wildcard in 1994 to the end of the 2011 season, a different rule was in place. Two teams tied for a division did not play a tiebreaker if their records were better than all non-division winners in their. league. Instead, such a tie was broken using the rules listed below ("Breaking Ties Without Playoff Games"). This scenario happened in the 2005 Major League Baseball season when the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox tied for first place in the American League East. The Yankees were awarded the division title on account of a better head-to-head record against the Red Sox, while Boston received the wildcard berth.
With, however, the adoption of a second wildcard berth and a wildcard game beginning in the 2012 season, the non-division winner with the best record in the league faces possible elimination on the first day of the postseason. As a result, the tie-breaking rules were changed so that two teams tied for a division championship must play a tie- breaking game even if both teams have already qualified for the postseason. The team losing the tie-breaking game will now qualify for a wildcard berth only if its regular-season record is among the league's two best records for non-division-winners. If that team is tied for the second wild-card spot, a second tie-breaking game would then be played.
If, on the other hand, two teams are tied for the first wildcard slot, no tie-breaking game is played. Rather, the two teams simply play against each other in the wildcard game, with home-field advantage awarded using tie-breaking rules described in the next section.
Ties between two division winners.
If two champions from separate divisions have the same record, the tiebreaking procedure listed above is used to determine playoff seeding. No additional games are played.
Ties between three teams.
Three-way tie for the division or wildcard.
The three teams will be designated as "A", "B" and "C". A two-game elimination format will ensue. In Game 1, A will host B. The following day, in Game 2, the winner of Game 1 will host C. The winner of Game 2 advances to the postseason.
The designations for teams A, B and C will be determined by the applicable scenario below.
1. If the three teams have identical records against each other in the regular season:
2. If the three teams do not have identical records against one another, the team designations are determined as follows:
"Mixed" three-way tie.
The situation may arise that two teams from the same division are tied for the division championship, but they are also tied with another team from a different division, with that team not having the best record in their division, but having a better record than all of the other non-division winners.
In this case the two teams in the same division play a one game playoff, with the winner declared the division champion. The loser of the first game earns the #2 wildcard slot, and travels to the stadium of the team outside their division for the wild card game.
Three-way tie for two Wild Card spots.
When there is a three-way tie between non-division winners and no other non-division winner has a better record claiming wild card 1, a tiebreaker eliminating 1 of the 3 teams will follow. The team with the best head-to-head record among the three teams is designated Team A, the team with the second-best record is designated Team B, and the remaining team is designated Team C. Team B will travel to team A. The winner wins wild card one. The loser will go to team C. The winner of that game wins wild card two. After those two games, wild card teams one and two will play each other in the wild card round; this could be an "A/B rematch." This information was provided by the MLB Commissioners office.
Three-way ties among division winners.
If there is a three-way tie among all division champions, the team with the best record against both of the other division champion is given the top seed with the remaining teams seeded as follows:
If neither team has a better record against the other teams, immediately go to above tiebreaker.
Ties among four teams.
The four teams draw lots, as teams A, B, C, and D. On the first day team B plays at team A and team D plays at team C. The next day the winners of these games play each other at the ballpark of either team A or B (depending on who won the game).

Leifsonia xyli xyli

"Leifsonia xyli" subsp. "xyli" is a small, fastidious, Gram-positive, coryneform bacterium that causes ratoon stunting disease, a major worldwide disease of sugarcane.
Classification.
Formerly classified as "Clavibacter xyli" subsp. "xyli", it was removed from the genus "Clavibacter" to create the genus "Leifsonia", together with "L. poae", found in "Poa annua" root galls, and "L. aquatica", a free-living bacterium. "Leifsonia xyli" subsp. "xyli" is a fastidious member of the GC-rich Actinomycetales., a taxonomic order that contains other genera of plant pathogens of great agricultural impact, including "Clavibacter", "Curtobacterium", and "Streptomyces".
Disease.
Ratoon stunting disease is the most economically important disease of sugarcane, and is found in most sugarcane growing areas of the world. It can cause yield losses of up to 30% in susceptible varieties. The disease is difficult to identify and is transmitted mechanically or through infected seeds.
Transmission.
Since the bacterium is present in the liquids of infected plants, it can be mechanically disseminated after contamination of the cane knives used in harvesting. Thus, the incidence of infected plants increases during successive ratoon crops. For this reason and for quite some time, cumulative losses due to the disease have probably been greater than the losses caused by any other sugarcane disease.
Evolution.
The bacterium has never been found affecting wild clones of "Saccharum officinarum" in its centre of diversity, Papua New Guinea, which suggests either it has recently evolved to infect its host, or has been acquired from a related species. It is believed to have evolved from a single pathogenic clone, since no genetic variation was found among different isolates of distinct countries and cultivars.
Symptoms.
Symptoms are highly dependent on the genetic background of the varieties and on environmental conditions. Because of this, the spread of the disease through planting material has beset most sugarcane growing areas in the world. Infected plants show reduced cane diameter and shortening of the internodes, i.e., stunting. Discolouration of vascular bundles of mature stalks may be seen in the form of discrete rosy dots or streaks just below the internodes where the bundles branch into the leaf sheath, but this is of little diagnostic value as infection by other pathogens may cause the same symptom.
Genetics.
"Leifsonia xyli" subsp. "xyli" has a relatively large number of pseudogenes suggestive of an ongoing process of genome decay. "L. xyli" subsp. "xyli" has been proposed as once a free-living bacterium, but is now restricted to the xylem as a consequence or cause of the accumulation of pseudogenes. This point stems from the observation although "L. xyli" subsp. "xyli" has only been detected inhabiting the xylem of sugarcane, it carries several genes typical of free-living organisms.

Archduke Leopold Ludwig of Austria

Archduke Leopold Ludwig of Austria (German: Leopold Ludwig Maria Franz Julius Estorgius Gerhard Erzherzog von Ósterreich) (b. Milan 6 June 1823 - d. Hórnstein 24 May 1898) was an Austrian general and admiral who served as "Oberkommandant der Marine" ('High Commander of the Navy') from 1864 to 1868.
Life.
He was the eldest son of Archduke Rainer Joseph of Austria (1783–1853) and Princess Elisabeth of Savoy (1800–1856) and a grandson of Emperor Leopold II. Leopold Ludwig was born in 1823 in Milan, where his father served as Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia from 1818 to 1848. A younger brother, Archduke Rainer Ferdinand (1827–1913), served as Austrian Minister President from 1859 to 1861. Leopold followed his father in a military career, attaining the rank of "Feldmarschall-leutnant" (lieutenant general) in the Austrian Army. 
When Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian was preparing to accept the throne of Mexico in March 1864, Emperor Franz Josef I sent Leopold to Miramar to induce Maximilian to sign the Act of Renunciation. The two cousins had never been on friendly terms, and Maximilian viewed Leopold as one of the archdukes who would benefit from the renunciation of his hereditary rights in Austria. Maximilian delayed signing the 'Family Compact', as it was called, until the visit of Franz Josef to Miramar on 9 April 1864.
Undoubtedly to Maximilian's chagrin and irritation, Leopold was named his successor as "Oberkommandant der Marine" with the rank of "Vizeadmiral" (vice admiral) in April 1864.
During Leopold's tenure as administrative head of the Navy, two notable sea battles were fought by Austrian forces under Wilhelm von Tegetthoff. On 9 May 1864 Austrian and Prussian warships clashed with a Danish squadron off Helgoland in the North Sea; although tactically indecisive, the battle achieved Tegetthoff's objective of causing the Danish squadron to lift its blockade of the Weser and Elbe ports.
In the second action, on 20 July 1866 a weaker Austrian squadron under Tegetthoff fell upon and decisively defeated a powerful Italian squadron off the island of Lissa (now Vis) in the Adriatic.
Owing to rapid developments in technology and the need to study the lessons of the Battle of Lissa, ships already under construction when Leopold took office in 1864 were completed but only two major vessels were begun during his tenure: the central battery ironclad "Lissa" and the screw sloop "Helgoland", both laid down in 1867.
With the organization of the Dual Monarchy in 1867, the naval service was reconstituted as the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Leopold was succeeded as head of the Navy in March 1868 by Tegetthoff, who received the new title of "Kommandant der Marine" ('Commander of the Navy').
Tegetthoff was also named to the new post of "Chef der Marinesektion" (Chief of the Naval Section) of the Imperial War Ministry. 
Leopold never married, and after stepping down as head of the Navy he faded into obscurity. He died at Hörnstein on 24 May 1898.

William Evans (politician)

William Evans (17 January 1788 – 8 April 1856) was a Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons in three periods between 1818 and 1852.
Evans was the son of William Evans of Darley and Elizabeth Strutt who was the daughter of Jedediah Strutt of Belper. The Evans family had made a fortune from lead mines at Bonsall, and an iron slitting and rolling mill in Derby and a cotton mill at Darley Abbey. They also owned the Evans Bank in Derby. 
Evans was Member of Parliament (MP) for East Retford from 1818 to 1820, and in 1826 unsuccessfully contested Leicester at a cost of between £20,000 and £30,000. In 1830 a compromise was reached and Evans was returned for Leicester without a poll, the same happening in 1831 when Evans was a reformist. Evans was re-elected in the 1832 Reformed parliament, but lost his seat in 1835. He was then elected for North Derbyshire in 1837 and held the seat until 1853, when he resigned by taking the Chiltern Hundreds.
Evans became High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1829 and was also a Deputy Lieutenant of Derbyshire and J. P.. He lived at Allestree Hall and was philanthropic in his support of schools and churches.
Evans married Mary Gisborne, daughter of Rev. Thomas Gisborne of Yoxall Lodge in July 1820. In 1850 he bought Pickford's House in Derby from William Pickford. He left this house to his son Sir Thomas William Evans, 1st Baronet who also became a Member of Parliament.

Sanna Nyassi

Sanna Nyassi (born 31 January 1989 in Bwiam) is a Gambian footballer who currently plays for Montreal Impact in Major League Soccer.
Career.
Professional.
Nyassi began his professional career in 2004 with Gambia Ports Authority of the GFA League First Division. The midfielder remained with the club through the 2007 season, helping the club capture the 2007 Gambian FA Cup, and scoring the game-winning goal in the final.
Nyassi's play with the Gambian Under-20 National Team sparked interest among many Major League Soccer clubs. In late 2007 Nyassi was on trial with New England Revolution, the club that signed his twin brother Sainey. Following a trial spell with newly formed Seattle Sounders FC, Sanna became the third player signed by the club. He was subsequently loaned to Seattle Sounders for the remainder of the 2008 season, prior to Seattle Sounders FC's MLS debut in 2009. On 5 October 2010 Nyassi scored two goals in the final of the 2010 Lamar Hunt US Open Cup Final to help Seattle to a 2–1 victory over Columbus Crew and capture its second straight Cup title. He became the first player in modern history to score multiple goals in the Cup final and was named Player of The Round as a result.
On 24 November 2010, Nyassi was selected by Vancouver Whitecaps FC as their first pick in the 2010 MLS Expansion Draft but he was immediately traded to Colorado Rapids for an international roster slot. On 20 July in a match versus New York Red Bulls, Nyassi scored his first MLS hat-trick and his first three goals for Colorado. His fourth goal of the season came on 29 July against Philadelphia Union. Strike partner Omar Cummings set up Nyassi with a lovely through ball and the Gambian scored with a curling shot to put his side 2–0 up.
Nyassi was left exposed by Colorado in the 2011 MLS Expansion Draft and was selected by expansion side Montreal Impact.
International.

Peter Wadding

Peter Wadding (c. 1581 – 13 September 1644) was an Irish Jesuit theologian.
Life.
Born at Waterford in 1581 or 1583, he was son of Thomas Wadding and his wife, Mary Vallesia. Both father and mother are said to have been of good family. Luke Wadding was his first cousin. 
Wadding studied humanities for seven years in Ireland, and then proceeded to Douai, where he graduates M.A., and subsequently doctor of both laws as well as of divinity. He was admitted to the Company of Jesus on 24 October 1601 by Father Oliveræus, the provincial of Flanders, and commenced his novitiate at Tournay on 23 November 1601.
Eventually he became professor of theology first at Louvain, and then at Antwerp. Subsequently Wadding was transferred to Prague, becoming professor of theology and chancellor of the university, and to exercise jurisdiction over, the university. The last years of his life were spent at Graz, where also he was professor of theology and chancellor. He died there on 13 September 1644.
Works.
While at Antwerp Wadding had a controversy with the famous Arminian Simon Episcopius. The disputations of both were published in Dutch after their death in one volume, entitled "Twee brieven van den gelerden Peter Wading in sijn level Jesuit tot Antwerpen: d’eene, van den Regel des Geloofs’ d’andere. van den beeldendienst …" Amsterdam, 1649, 4to (British Museum). On 30 November 1632 Wadding completed a "Brevis Refutatio Calumniarum quas Collegio Societatis Jesu Pragensi impegit scriptor famosi libelli cui titulus “Flagellum Jesuitarum”, præsertim in negotio Academiæ Pragnensis …" Nissa, 1634, 4to. This was followed by a solid work of 656 pages, entitled "R.P. Petri Wadingi Waterfordiensis Hibernie Soc. Jes S. Theologiæ professoris, olim in Lovaniensi nunc in Pragensi Academia professoris Tractatus de Incarnation," Antwerp, 1636, 8vo. In the following year he published an "Oratio Pragæ dicta", congratulating Ferdinand III on his election as emperor. 
Besides the works mentioned, Wadding’s contemporary fellow Jesuit, Pedro de Ribadeneira, says he published under a pseudonym, "Carmina varia et alia spectantia ad disciplinas humaniores", and "Tractatus aliquos contra Hæreticos" (Ribadeneira, ‘’Bibl. Scriptt. Soc. Jesu’’’, 1643, p. 402). A manuscript volume in the Bodleian Library contains various other treatises by him (Tanner, p. 744).

High-speed door

High Speed Doors are Door systems, mainly used in industrial applications. They are technical enhancements of the generally known sectional door, PVC fabric doors or roller shutter. The main difference is that the durable construction provides a higher operating speed and they are able to sustain a higher number of cycles (opening and closing cycles) and require lower maintenance and repair cost. Depending on the intended field of application, horizontal or vertical operating door types are available.
In North America, the Door and Access Systems Manufacturing Association (DASMA) defines high-performance doors as non-residential, powered doors, characterized by rolling, folding, sliding or swinging action, that are either high-cycle (minimum 100 cycles/day) or high-speed (minimum 20 inches(508 mm)/second), and two out of three of the following: made-to-order for exact size and custom features, designed to be able to withstand equipment impact (break-away if accidentally hit by vehicle) or designed to sustain heavy usage with minimal maintenance.
Application.
The High Speed Doors are usually used wherever goods traffic occurs and where the doors have to fulfill special requirements. In the food and beverage industry Medial industry for example, special climatic conditions have to be prevailed. Short opening and closing times reduce cooling loss, avoid airflow and enable a smooth operating procedure. It can also be design for big dimension doors for mining and aircraft industry
In the beverage industry:
Intelligent airlock solutions can be achieved by means of high-speed doors. Two doors with the highly transparent laths gives a clear view throughout. Pressure and temperature differences can easily be controlled by an airlock where the transporter enters the airlock, with the one door cannot be operated before the other has closed. This is also used in security application.
In food, clean, and pharmaceutical processes:
In strict environmental constraints of pharmaceutical and aggressive environments of the food processes, where hygiene is imperative, doors must not only provide a structure made of stainless steel or composite materials to prevent corrosion, but they must also ensure an exposure time as short as possible to reduce the risk of airborne contamination.
In the car manufacturing industry:
The automotive industry is the industry where high speed doors are the most well known. High volumes of cars are produced in short periods of time. High speed doors are vital for the logistics processes, high speed and low maintenance ensures optimum production. A special high speed folding door are used on the dynamo tuning cells.
Profitability:
High-speed doors by increase the efficiency of every company. High opening speeds minimize the waiting time in front of the doors and thus accelerate the logistic processes, controls temperatures and pressure differences while saving energy. Isolating clean areas from airborne contamination but still optimizing traffic flow.
Requirements.
High strains, caused by the high operating speed (up to 4 m/s) and the frequency of openings, have to be taken into account during construction.
In the same way, basic conditions like size and installation location add up to considerable requirements regarding safety and control technique.
A unique "roll-up" system generally defines a high speed door from an conventional roller door. The door's main objective is to produce a high opening speed and the guiding system must allow smooth operations with minimal friction. Effortless movement will ensure the longevity of the door's moving parts and operating soundness. Latest versions of high quality high speed doors uses a spiral guiding system, thus keeping the door blade apart through a whole operating cycle, ensuring effortless movement of the door's roller devices in the guiding system and contributing to the excessive high speed… Excessive because these doors, by opening so fast and closing very slowly, are just trying to avoid to get their rigid closing edge caught by a forklift, at the expense of the insulation.
A counterbalance system generally forms part of the door's construction. This is designed with spring or weight mechanisms in the side frames, ensuring an emergency opening function and aiding to the opening speed.
Regulation.
In Europe, after a few incidents due to the excessive speed of the curtain and the stiffness of the embedded sensor, the European Community has implemented new regulations (EN 13-241-1). Among the various normative constraints, the requirement against mechanical crushing during closure makes necessary to prevent contact with the door being closed or, in case of contact, to limit the vertical dynamic load below a strict curve. 
If the high-speed door does not meet one or more of these constraints, the closing speed will be limited to 0.5 m/s (1.64 ft/s). Only a few manufacturers offering a fully flexible and harmless sealing edge kept possibility of closing at a higher speed.

Royalties for Regions policy

Royalties for Regions is a political policy formulated by the National Party of Western Australia in 2008 which involves the redirection of government spending from the major population centres, particularly Perth, into the rural areas of the state. This spending would be funded by setting aside 25% of the state's mining and petroleum royalty revenue.
Following the 2008 state election, the National Party used its balance of power in the WA parliament to form government with the Liberals led by Colin Barnett, by trading Nationals support in exchange for spending guarantees under the policy.
Main policy features.
In 2006-07, the state received royalties totalling $2.1 billion (2007-08 forecast:$2.5 billion, 2008-09:$2.7 billion). This data suggests that $675 million of annual funding could be assigned under the policy.
Responses.
On 10 September 2008, WA's Department of Treasury and Finance issued a public statement saying that the policy could threaten the state's AAA sovereign credit rating.
which would cause an increase in the cost of short-term funding. Under Treasurer Tim Marney said that the plan would cost $2.8 billion in additional expenditure over the next four years, and in the absence of offsetting changes, take the net debt to revenue ratio to around 53% by 2011-12. 47% is the financial target adopted by Treasury to maintain the rating. The state budget is currently in surplus with $203 million the forecast surplus for 2011-12.
Nationals leader Brendon Grylls stated that the ratio blowout could be avoided by reassessing major capital projects in Perth, such as the proposed $500 million museum redevelopment and the suburban rail extension to Ellenbrook which was expected to cost $850 million.
Critics of the proposal have suggested that the idea of the Nationals siding the Australian Labor Party to achieve the outcome was a betrayal of the historical conservative leanings of the party as it has previously generally formed coalitions with the Liberal Party.

Santonic acid is an organic compound containing both carboxylic acid and ketone functionality.
It was synthesized from santonin by base-mediated hydrolysis of a lactone followed by a multistep rearrangement process by R. B. Woodward.
Unusually for a carboxylic acid, santonic acid does not form hydrogen-bonded dimers in the crystalline phase. Rather, it adopts a polymeric structure, with individual santonic acid molecules linked by intermolecular carboxyl-to-ketone hydrogen bonds.

Playing career.
College.
Palubinskas started his collegiate career at Ricks Junior College in Rexburg, Idaho in 1970, where he led the U.S. in free throw percentage with 92.4%. He holds the record for the most consecutive free throws in a game (14) and 43 consecutive for the season. He was also selected as an All-American that year while breaking most records at Ricks College which is now BYU-Idaho. Palubinskas then transferred to Louisiana State University, after playing in the Munich Olympics where he was second leading scorer missing the Olympic scoring title by one point. At LSU, Palubinskas averaged 18.6 ppg and was selected to the All-SEC Coaches Team.
Professional.
Ed was selected in the 1975 NBA Draft by the Atlanta Hawks in the 3rd round. He was then traded to the New Orleans Jazz and drafted in the 8th round of the ABA draft by the Utah Stars.
Olympics.
After being the 2nd leading scorer in the 1972 Summer Olympics, Palubinskas was the top overall scorer in 1976 Summer Olympics. He set three Olympic scoring records in Montreal, most notably the record for most points scored in a single Olympics (269), which was broken by Brazilian Oscar Schmidt during the 1988 Summer Olympics with the aid of the 3 point line which did not exist in 1976..
The most points he scored in one game was 48 against Mexico in overtime.
Coaching career.
Palubinskas took a position as shooting coach to Shaquille O'Neal with the Los Angeles Lakers for the entire 2000-01 NBA season. O'Neal's improved free throw shooting helped lead the Lakers to the 2001 NBA Championship. He went from 38.3% to 69.4% with Palubinskas' tutelage.
Other professional basketball players Ed has worked with are the following:

DB Class 23

The steam locomotives of Class 23 were German passenger train locomotives developed in the 1950s for the Deutsche Bundesbahn. They had a 2-6-2 wheel arrangement and were equipped with Class 2'2' T 31 tenders. They were designed to replace the once ubiquitous Prussian P 8 engines that had been built between 1908 and 1924 and, in their day, were the most numerous post-war replacement class.
Manufacture and Design.
From 1950, 105 examples of this newly designed class were manufactured for medium passenger train and light express train services. They had welded locomotive frames, boilers and tenders together with all the latest refinements of German practice. These included a superheated multiple-valve regulator and central lubrication of the least accessible parts of the running gear. Engines up to operating number 023 had "Knorr" surface preheaters and journal bearings. Locomotives with serial numbers 024 and 025, as well as those from 053 onwards were equipped with roller bearings for the axles and drive as well as mixer-preheaters. A small number of vehicles were given "Heinl" preheaters and several were equipped for push-pull train operations.
Last new steam locomotive in West Germany.
Locomotive number 23 105, built by Arnold Jung Lokomotivfabrik and taken into service by the DB in December 1959, was the last steam engine to enter service in the Federal Republic of Germany. After its retirement it was stabled at the Nuremberg Transport Museum where it was severely damaged by the great fire in the locomotive shed on 17 October 2005.
Reclassification and retirement.
On the introduction of the new DB numbering scheme on 1 January 1968 the class was redesignated as Class 023. The last few locomotives were retired in 1976 at Crailsheim locomotive depot ("Bahnbetriebswerk" or "Bw").
Preserved locomotives.
The following engines had been preserved as at September 2006:

<doc id="19261407" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19261407" title="Platform ticket">
Platform ticket

A platform ticket is a type of rail ticket issued by some railway systems, permitting the bearer to access the platforms of a railway station, but not to board and use any train services. It allows people to walk with their friends and loved ones all the way to the passenger car at stations where the general public is not admitted to platforms. Railfans can also purchase platform tickets and enjoy their trainspotting hobbies. They vary in type: some may only allow limited access and a sharply limited time of usage, while others may have totally free access to enter the platform area. During peak usage hours or rush hours, the platforms may only be available for passengers who intend to travel.
History.
Platform tickets are an invention of the 19th Century. At that time conductors had to move outside of the trains cars from one step outside of the compartment to the next. Although trains moved much slower than today, there were numerous accidents. So the operators decided to check the tickets on the platform - before everybody would get on the train. People who wanted to pass these chechpoints were asked to buy a ticket that was just valid for access to the platform. After railcars were changed and people (and conductors) could move from car to car, checking the tickets outside the train was not necessary any more. So most rail transport systems abolished this in the second half of the 20th Century. As soon as there were no more checks, the platform ticket was unnecessary and abandoned.
Germany.
In Germany the Royal Prussian Railway was the first carrier to introduce ticket checks outside the trains in 1893. Other railways in Germany soon followed. Platform checks and tickets were done away with in East Germany in 1970 and in West Germany in 1974. The only exception are the local train networks in Hamburg and Munich, where platform tickets can still be bought.
Usage by country.
India.
A platform ticket in India costs 5 (increased in 2012 Railway Budget) and is valid for one person only. It allows the person to access the platforms for a time period of two hours. A person having a railway ticket for a train on the same day is not required to have a platform ticket. The platform ticket can be bought on any ticket reservation booth in the railway station. If caught without a platform ticket if the person is not a traveler, he/she may be fined anywhere from 250 to 270.
Japan.
Japan Railways Group (JR Group) companies sell priced between 120 yen and 160 yen at all staffed stations and , which allow unlimited access to the platform area for one month, priced between 3,780 yen and 4,890 yen at limited stations. They do not allow holders to board trains. All staffed stations of JR East, JR Central and JR West, and stations of JR Hokkaido with automatic ticket gates limit the validity of the ticket to two hours from issuance; an additional fee is charged if the ticket holder exits the ticket gate after the two-hour period expires.
United Kingdom.
Platform tickets were in common use on the mainline network until the mid 20th century, and the majority of ticket offices are still equipped to issue them. The use of automated ticket barriers at stations has resulted in a renewed demand for platform tickets. Railfans, in particular, are told that they may require a platform ticket for access to platforms, but some individuals have expressed difficulty in obtaining them.
Some heritage railways and museums issue platform tickets for admittance or as souvenirs.

Anonymous for Animal Rights

Anonymous for Animal Rights is an animal rights group based in Israel. 
It focuses on several animal rights issues: the consumption of meat and animal source foods, using animals for clothing and entertainment, and animal testing. The group started organizing protests in the 1990s and became formally organized in 1994. The name "Anonymous" was chosen as a form of identification with the anonymity of animals in industrial farms, labs, and other industries.
Principles.
"Anonymous" oppose animal-based food industries (such as meat, fish, milk and eggs) due to the suffering caused to animals in these industries; it calls for a vegan lifestyle.
Activities.
"Anonymous" activities are focused in three areas: documentation, information dissemination, and legal areas (legislation and regulation).
Documentation.
"Anonymous" documents cases of violation of animal rights. It regularly visits industrial farms, and compares their practices to those allowed by law, assisted by theoretical agricultural research and by animal rights groups in Europe and the United States.
Information dissemination.
"Anonymous" distributes printed material regarding animal rights. Leaflets and booklets are distributed in public events and in lectures in schools. The organization’s weekly publication is titled "This week in Animals Rights" and is distributed by e-mail since 2001.
The organization also maintains a web site that describes cruelties in animal industries, including photographs and films that were taken in chicken coops and cowsheds. The web site also contains practical information about vegan lifestyle, including nutritional advice and recipes.
"Anonymous" are also responsible for maintenance and updates to the Israeli Vegetarian Society web site.
Legislation and regulation.
"Anonymous" works with governmental units, trying to advance legislation and regulation regarding animal welfare, and the enforcement of existing regulations.
Other animal rights organizations in Israel.
"Anonymous for Animal Rights" is the largest animal liberation movement in Israel. Some smaller groups splintered from it during the years, including ""Ma'avak Ehad"" ("One Struggle", an anarchist-motivated political group) and ""Shevi"" ("Animal Liberation Israel").

American Measurement Standard

The American Measurement Standard is an authoritative measurement standard for use with single-family dwellings. The AMS C42129-2009 is a voluntary guide developed for the measurement, calculation, and communication of square footage in residential dwellings. 
Description.
This standard defines eight specific categories for the reporting of all space associated with a residential dwelling. The AMS helps to establish common and logical definitions of "finished square footage" and "gross living area." The methodology of the American Measurement Standard was compiled and edited by a consensus of real estate professionals including real estate agents, appraisers, assessors, home builders and architects, and is based on the exterior dimensions of a dwelling. The AMS contains over three times more specific home measurement details than any other square footage guideline and includes numerous illustrations and examples. The standard provides acceptable square footage calculations for use in residential mortgage appraisals, and provides acceptable measurements for mortgage lenders. The principles and practices detailed in the standard have been used for generations in professional appraisal reports.

James Nagle (general)

James Nagle (April 5, 1822 – August 22, 1866) was an officer in the United States Army in both the Mexican War and the Civil War. During the latter conflict, he recruited and commanded four infantry regiments from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania and led two different brigades in the Eastern Theater. As the war progressed, worsening health problems precluded prolonged field service, but Nagle is perhaps best known for his actions at the 1862 Battle of Antietam, where his brigade played a key role in securing Burnside's Bridge, a key crossing over the contested Antietam Creek.
Early life and career.
Nagle was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, as the eldest of eight children born and raised by Daniel and Mary Nagle. His grandfather had been a drummer in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. His family moved several times when he was a child, finally settling in 1835 in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, where in 1842 he organized what became the Washington Artillery Company. He learned the trades of paperhanger and painter from his father.
When war was declared against Mexico a few years later, he enlisted with his men as Company B of the 1st Pennsylvania Volunteers. His regiment was stationed at the Perote Castle to keep open the communication with Veracruz during its siege. He assisted in routing a force of guerillas at La Hoya, fought at Huamantla, Puebla, and Atlixco, entered the city of Mexico, and was finally stationed at San Ángel until the close of the war. He was mustered out of service with his company at Philadelphia on July 27, 1848, and the inhabitants of Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, presented him with a commemorative silver and gold-plated sword.
Nagle subsequently resumed his business as a painter and paperhanger. In 1852, he was elected as the Sheriff of Schuylkill County, a post he would occupy until war erupted in 1861. Also in 1852, Nagle married Elizabeth Kaercher, who bore nine children, seven of which lived to maturity. He was also on the Pottsville School Board, and was a member and then president of the borough council.
Civil War service.
In 1861, following the outbreak of the Civil War, Nagle was commissioned as the colonel of the 6th Pennsylvania Infantry, a regiment with a three-month term of enlistment. Later that year, after his regiment mustered out of the service, he organized the three-years' 48th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment, of which he was made colonel. Among his men were four of his brothers, as well as much of the current membership of his old Washington Artillery. Nagle initially served at Fort Monroe in Virginia, and then in Hatteras Island and Newbern in North Carolina. On April 23, 1862, he was assigned command of the 1st Brigade of Maj. Gen. Jesse Reno's 2nd Division of the Department of North Carolina.
Nagle commanded his brigade (now in the IX Corps under Reno) in the Second Battle of Bull Run. He was appointed brigadier general of volunteers on September 10, 1862, and at Antietam his brigade performed an important part in carrying what later became known as Burnside's Bridge, which, according to army commander George B. McClellan, saved the day.
Nagle's appointment expired on March 4, 1863, but was renewed nine days later and he served with his brigade in Kentucky until May 9, when he resigned due to impaired health (he suffered from heart disease). He returned home to recuperate. When General Robert E. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in June 1863, General Nagle organized the 39th Pennsylvania Volunteer Militia and was commissioned its colonel by Governor Andrew Curtin. He subsequently commanded a brigade of emergency militia, and was mustered out on August 2, 1863, following the end of the Gettysburg Campaign and the retreat of Lee's army into Virginia. 
In 1864 he organized the 149th Pennsylvania Infantry for 100 days' service, became its colonel, and guarded the approaches to Baltimore, Maryland, until the expiration of his service.
Postbellum.
After the war, Nagle resumed civilian life, but was in poor health from his ailing heart and liver. He died in 1866 at his Pottsville home, surrounded by his family. His well attended funeral was held on Saturday, August 25, and he was buried in Pottsville's Presbyterian Cemetery.
He is honored with a statue on the 48th Pennsylvania's monument on the Antietam Battlefield near Sharpsburg, Maryland.

Aucuba japonica

Aucuba japonica, commonly called spotted laurel, Japanese laurel, Japanese aucuba or gold dust plant (U.S.), is a shrub (1–5 m, 3.28-16.40 ft) native to rich forest soils of moist valleys, thickets, by streams and near shaded moist rocks in China and Japan. This is the species of "Aucuba" commonly seen in gardens - often in variegated form. The leaves are opposite, broad lanceolate, 5–8 cm (1.9-3.15 in) long and 2–5 cm (.78-1.9 in) wide. "Aucuba japonica" are dioecious, they have separate male and female plants. The flowers are small, 4–8 mm (0.15–0.31 in) diameter, with four purplish-brown petals; they are produced in clusters of 10-30 in a loose cyme. The fruit is a red berry approximately 1 cm (.39 in) in diameter, which is avoided by birds.
Cultivation and uses.
"Aucuba japonica" was introduced into England in 1783 by Philip Miller's pupil John Graeffer, at first as a plant for a heated greenhouse. It became widely cultivated as the "gold plant" by 19th-century gardeners. The plants being grown were female, and it was a purpose of Robert Fortune's botanizing trip to newly opened Japan in 1861 to locate a male. It was located in the garden of Dr. Hall, resident at Yokohama, and sent to the nursery of Standish & Noble at Bagshot, Surrey. The firm's mother plant was fertilized and displayed, covered with red berries, at Kensington in 1864, creating a sensation that climaxed in 1891 with the statement from the Royal Horticultural Society's secretary, the Rev. W. Wilkes, "You can hardly have too much of it". A reaction to its ubiquitous presence set in after World War II.
This plant is valued for its ability to thrive in the most difficult of garden environments, dry shade. It also copes with pollution and salt-laden coastal winds. It is often seen as an informal hedge, but may also be grown indoors as a houseplant. Today numerous cultivars are available from garden centres. The most popular cultivar is 'Variegata', with yellow spots on the leaves; this is a female clone, a similar male clone being named 'Maculata'. The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:-

Gietrzwałd

Gietrzwałd (German: "Dietrichswalde") is a village in northeastern Poland located in Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, near Olsztyn. Gietrzwałd is the capital of Gietrzwałd commune.
Natural geography.
The area where Gietrzwałd is located has specific features caused by a glacier. As a result, the region has varied terrain and great richness and diversity of nature. The most important natural values of the region are its lakes and rivers. The Giławka River, which Gietrzwałd is situated upon, is the right tributary of the Pasłęka River.
History.
Gietrzwałd was founded in 1352 by Dietrich, who named it Dietrichswald.
In the 15th century, Gietrzwałd was destroyed during the Thirteen Years' War between Poland and the Teutonic Knights. The village was invaded by the Teutonic army under the command of Jerzy von Schlieben.
In the middle of the 16th century, the settlement was not developing, although there was a school and an inn (Jerzy Kunig had been the owner of the inn since 1645).
In 1783, there were 57 houses in Gietrzwałd. In 1807, the village was attacked and plundered by the French army in the Napoleonic wars.
Marian Apparitions.
In the year 1877, according to the Catholics, the Virgin Mary was revealed to two little girls, Barbara Samulowska and Justyne Szafryńska. She appeared several times, speaking the Polish language (as opposed to German; Poland was under German occupation at the time), and explained how important it is to pray and say the rosary.
Since then, pilgrims from Poland and foreign countries, have been coming to Gietrzwałd to see the picture of the Virgin Mary and a miracle spring. The Catholic Church acknowledged the Vision of the Mother of Christ as real in 1977. The town is now an official pilgrim area.
Culture.
There is a Communal Cultural Centre in Gietrzwałd. It is open all year. People can find tourist information there and buy handcrafts in a gallery.
The Centre is the initiator and organizer of various events, which take place in the province. Furthermore, it is responsible for taking actions in social and cultural animation, education and art workshops for children and adults.
Religion.
The most important religious monument in Gietrzwałd is the Shrine of Virgin Mary and the Stations of the Cross located near the forest. There is also a rosary alley leading to the miracle spring, the chapel of the apparitions and the picture of Virgin Mary.
A very distinctive element of the Warmian landscape are the chapels. Only in Gietrzwałd there are several of them. They used to emphasize the Catholic faith and focus the rural life around the building. The most famous chapel in Gietrzwałd is the Apparitions Chapel in front of the sanctuary.
Education.
Schools in Gietrzwałd:
Transport.
Buses run from Olsztyn and Ostróda to the village. It is also connected to Olsztyn by National Road 16. The nearest railway station is located from the village, in Biesal.

Fleming Castle

The Flemington Castle, also known as Samuel Fleming House, is an historic home located in Flemington, in Hunterdon County, New Jersey, United States, built in 1756. The building is now operated as a museum. It is the oldest surviving house in the borough.
Samuel Fleming, born in Ireland in 1707, came to the present-day United States and worked nearby as a tavernmaster, and bought in present-day Flemington as the site for a home in 1741 from Thomas Penn, son of William Penn, the founder of the Province of Pennsylvania. After the house was constructed in 1756, the area becoming known as "The Fleming Settlement", then as "Fleming's" and was known as "Flemington" by the 1870s. Fleming operated a tavern, often said to be in the house itself, which was said to have been visited by General George Washington, who it was claimed wrote about "stopping at Fleming's" in his journal.
The site was sold to the Borough of Flemington by the Daughters of the American Revolution for use as a museum. The Castle has been arranged to depict typical life in the 18th century including a colonial-style kitchen, ladies parlor and tavern room.
A 2007 study by an historic preservation consultancy hired by the borough determined that claims that the house had been used as tavern, as a stagecoach stop and as a post office, and that it had been visited by George Washington were untrue, and had been embellished based on a newspaper story dating to 1870. A review of historical documents showed that Fleming operated a tavern, but that it was not located in the historic house. Court records showed that the Fleming Castle property had been seized in a sheriff’s sale in 1763 and the tavern was seized in a separate sale in 1766. Records also showed that Fleming had been given a license to operate a tavern in 1746, ten years before the house was built. Despite longstanding tradition, an analysis of contemporary documents found no mention of Washington ever having visited the site.
The research also determined that there was no evidence that Fleming used the term "castle" to refer to his home. The minutes of a meeting of the Colonel Lowrey Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution held in 1906 contain the first reference to the site as the "Fleming Castle". The house was deeded to the Lowrey Chapter in 1927, which maintained the site and used it as its offices and as a museum. The group sold the house to the borough of Flemington in 2005 for $138,000.

Sindo Garay

Sindo Garay was born Antonio Gumersindo Garay Garcia (Santiago de Cuba, 12 April 1867 – Havana, 17 July 1968). He was the first, the smallest, and perhaps the longest-lived, of the trova artists taught by Pepe Sánchez. Garay was one of the "four greats of the trova". Sindo Garay was Spanish & Arawkan descendant. He was Indo-Cuban.
Life & work.
Garay was the most outstanding composer of trova songs, and his best have been sung and recorded many times. "Perla marina", "Adios a La Habana", "Mujer bayamesa", "El huracan y la palma", "Guarina" and many others are now part of Cuba's heritage. Garay was also musically illiterate – in fact, he only taught himself the alphabet at 16 – but in his case not only were scores transcribed by others, but there are recordings as well.
For a long period he sang in a duo with his eldest son "Guarionex"; he had two other sons and a daughter, and gave them all Indian names.
In the 1890s Garay got involved in the Cuban War of Independence, and decided a stay in Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic) would be a good idea. It was, and he came back with a wife. Garay settled in Havana in 1906, and in 1926 joined Rita Montaner and others to visit Paris, spending three months there singing his songs. He broadcast on radio, made recordings and survived into modern times. He used to say "Not many men have shaken hands with both Jose Marti and Fidel Castro!" Carlos Puebla, whose life spanned the old and the new trova, told a good joke about him: "Sindo celebrated his 100th birthday several times – in fact, whenever he was short of money!"

American Payroll Association

The American Payroll Association (APA) is a professional association for individuals responsible for processing company payrolls. The Association conducts payroll training courses and seminars yearly and publishes a library of payroll resource texts and newsletters. The APA has approximately 21,000 members, 156 APA-affiliated local chapters, and registered lobbyists based in Washington, D.C.
The APA was founded in 1982 and is headquartered in San Antonio, Texas with additional offices in New York, Las Vegas and Washington, D.C. In addition, the APA owns and operates two learning centers, the San Antonio Learning Center and MEET Las Vegas. Both Learning Centers offer payroll training utilizing the latest technology and computer networking capabilities.
Education.
The biggest of APA’s educational offerings is its annual Congress. The event has more than 100 payroll and AP related workshops, guest speakers including government officials and industry experts, and a payroll and AP exhibit hall. The Association also publishes a complete library of resource texts and newsletters for payroll.
They offer comprehensive education for payroll professionals, including a full slate of training courses and conferences from Payroll 101 to Advance and/or Strategic Payroll. Training is available in a variety of formats including live classroom training, eLearning, virtual classrooms, webinars and webinars on demand.
They also offer a comprehensive library of compliance resources, which is produced by the Association's experienced team of payroll and employment law experts. Publications are issued in many media, including printed text, e-book, magazine, e-magazine, newsletter, e-newsletter, and CD.
Government relations.
The APA participates in lobbying activities in Washington, D.C., and sponsors multiple member-lead committees called “Government Affairs Task Force” committees. The committees cover areas such as the following: Child Support & Other Garnishments, Federal Tax Forms & Publications, Immigration, Payroll Cards, SSA Wage Reporting, and Unemployment Insurance. The purpose of these committees is to communicate the concerns of the payroll community to legislative and executive branches of government and to find ways for employers to meet their requirements under law and support government objectives, while minimizing administrative burden and cost for employers, government, and individual taxpayers.
The major federal agencies with which APA has relationships include:
In May 2008, IRS Commissioner Douglas H Shulman delivered an address to the attendees of the APA's 2008 Congress highlighting the importance of the relationship between the IRS and APA, stating, “APA has a long history of providing valuable advice and feedback to the IRS as we have implemented a number of important tax laws that have played a prominent role in the economic development of our nation.”
Further example of the APA’s involvement with various government bodies is the APA's contributions to publications such as the IRS/SSA Reporter. Additionally, APA's Government Relations staff has received SSA's Public Service Award for its ongoing dedication to improving the quality of employer wage and tax reporting and the IRS's Excellence in Partnering Award for its collaboration on clarifying employers' responsibilities and helping IRS educate employers. At IRS, the APA is a founding member of the Information Reporting Program Advisory Committee and also has had representation on the IRS Advisory Council and the Electronic Tax Administration Advisory Committee.
Professional certification.
Payroll certification verifies a specified level of knowledge, skills and abilities in the payroll profession. APA offers two levels of professional certification—the Fundamental Payroll Certification (FPC) and the Certified Payroll Professional (CPP).
National Payroll Week.
Every year the American Payroll Association hosts National Payroll Week, a national celebration and public awareness campaign. National Payroll Week (or NPW) is held annually during week of Labor Day, and celebrates the hard work by America's 156 million wage earners and the payroll professionals who pay them. Together, through the payroll withholding system, they contribute, collect, report and deposit approximately $1.7 trillion (71.8%) of the annual revenue of the US Treasury.
American Accounts Payable Association.
In 2008, the APA launched a sister association, the American Accounts Payable Association (AAPA). AAPA provides training, publications, and other resources to help AP professionals implement strategies and best practices, while maintaining compliance with state and federal laws and regulations.

Willie Moir

William Moir, (born 19 April 1922, died 1988), better known as Willie Moir, was a Scottish footballer who played for the majority of his career at Bolton Wanderers. He played mostly as an inside-right.
Born in Aberdeen, he signed for Bolton during the war years and made his professional league debut when regular league football re started in 1946. Playing alongside Nat Lofthouse he was the Championship's top scorer in 1948–49 with 25 goals and continued good goal scoring form in the next few years, although always coming behind the more prolific Lofthouse.
Moir was captain when Bolton gave away a 3–1 lead to Blackpool in the Matthews Cup Final, scoring in the game. Two years later he left the club to join Stockport County where he spent a further two years as player manager before retiring from playing. He left Stockport County in 1960.
He died in 1988 at the age of 66.

Li Chenghong

Li Chenghong (李承宏), commonly known as the Prince of Guangwu (廣武王), was an imperial prince of the Chinese Tang Dynasty who was briefly declared emperor in 763 by invading Tibetan forces after they had captured the Tang capital Chang'an.
Background.
It is not known when Li Chenghong was born. He was the oldest son of Li Shouli the Prince of Bin, the second son of Li Xian, one time crown prince under Li Xian's father Emperor Gaozong. Early in the "Kaiyuan" (713-741) era of Li Shouli's cousin Emperor Xuanzong, Li Chenghong was created the Prince of Guangwu, and he did not succeed to the greater title of Prince of Bin upon his father's death in 741, suggesting that he was not born of Li Shouli's wife. (The title of Prince of Bin went to his younger brother Li Chengning (李承寧).)
Li Chenghong had at one point been given the honorary title of "Mishu Jian" (秘書監), the director of the archival bureau (秘書省, "Mishu Sheng") -- but as the title was honorary, he did not actually run the archival bureau. At one point, he was accused of improper associations with people and was demoted to be the secretary general to the prefect of Fang Prefecture (房州, in modern Shiyan, Hubei), but was later recalled to the capital Chang'an and given the honorary title of minister of imperial clan affairs (宗正卿), but did not actually run the ministry of imperial clan affairs.
Brief declaration as emperor.
In 763, when Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong was emperor, Tibet launched an attack against Chang'an, and Emperor Daizong was forced to flee to Shan Prefecture (陝州, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). On November 18, 763, Tibetan forces entered Chang'an. A Tibetan general who defected from Tang, Gao Hui (高暉), and the Tibetan general Ma Chongying (馬重英) jointly declared Li Chenghong emperor, commissioning over 100 people as imperial officials, including the imperial scholars Yu Kefeng (于可封) and Huo Gui (霍瓌) as chancellors. Tibetan forces, however, were unable to force the chancellor Miao Jinqing, who was unable to flee Chang'an due to illness, to cooperate with Li Chenghong's regime. Soon, with the Tang general Guo Ziyi mounting a resistance movement, Tibetan forces pillaged the city and departed on November 30, 763. Li Chenghong hid in the wilderness but was recaptured by Guo's forces. Emperor Daizong issued a pardon for him but exiled him to Hua Prefecture (華州, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). He died in Hua Prefecture shortly after.

<doc id="19261652" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19261652" title="German (mythology)">
German (mythology)

German (, ) is a South Slavic mythological being, recorded in the folklore of eastern Serbia and northern Bulgaria. He is a male spirit associated with bringing rain and hail. His influence on these precipitations can be positive, resulting with the amount of rain beneficial for agriculture, or negative, with a drought, downpours, or hail. Rituals connected with German included making a doll intended to represent this personage. This effigy of German, made of rags, fired clay, or dried fruits, was rather large, usually with a distinct representation of the male genitals. It was produced and used in rituals exclusively by girls or young women.
In eastern Serbia, when a drought developed, girls would make such a doll, and bring it to a river bank. Depending on the regional custom, they would either bury it by the river, or put it in a little casket and let it flow down the river. Two of the girls would then start lamenting for the doll. Asked by the others why they were crying, they would answer, “We are crying for German; because of the drought German has died for the rain to fall.” If the amount of rain would become excessive after that, the doll was dug out. In northern Bulgaria, the rituals with German usually followed immediately after the Dodola rituals, but could be performed independently from them. In some villages they were carried out on the Feast of Saint Germanus. Girls would make the doll, 20 to 50 cm long, and lay it on a slate or in a little casket. Having adorned it with flowers, they would bury it with funeral observances. After three, nine, or forty days, the doll was dug out, and thrown into water.
People tried to prevent destructive summer hailstorms by placating German with a ritual performed on Christmas Eve. This ritual was recorded in the area around Pirot at the beginning of the 20th century. Immediately before the start of the Christmas Eve dinner, the head of the household would go out to his woodpile, to invite German to dinner. He would take with him a loaf of bread called "good luck", prepared particularly for this ritual, slivovitz, wine, and a wax candle. At the woodpile, he would shout three times, “German, German, wherever you are, come to dinner right now, and in the summer do not let me see your eyes anywhere!” He would then light the candle, take a sip of slivovitz, taste some bread, drink wine, and go back into his house. Asked what happened with German, he would answer, “He came, so we dined and drank amply of slivovitz and wine, and then we parted.”
German, who dies so that the nature may regenerate with the falling of rain, can be understood as a spirit of vegetation, dying and then resurrecting with the revival of vegetation. His distinctly represented male genitals symbolize fertility. The doll of German is presumably a metaphorical replacement of the former human sacrifice. It can be included among the Slavic sacrificial dolls, together with the dolls of Yarilo, Kostroma, and Morena.
In Christianized folk beliefs German is identified with Saint Germanus. This saint is associated with the protection from hail, and occasionally from lightning, though the latter was generally ascribed to Saint Elijah.

The Dybbuk (film)

The Dybbuk (; ) is a 1937 Yiddish language Polish fantasy film drama directed by Michał Waszyński. It is based on the play "The Dybbuk" by S. Ansky.
"The Dybbuk, or Between Two Worlds" (Yiddish: דער דיבוק אדער צווישן צוויי וועלטן) is a 1914 play by S. Ansky, relating the story of a young bride possessed by a dybbuk – a malicious possessing spirit, believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person – on the eve of her wedding. "The Dybbuk" is considered a seminal play in the history of Jewish theatre, and played an important role in the development of Yiddish theatre and theatre in Israel. The play was based on years of research by Ansky, who traveled between Jewish shtetls in Russia and Ukraine, documenting folk beliefs and stories of the Hassidic Jews.
In 1937, the play, with some changes in the plot structure, was filmed by director Michał Waszyński in Warsaw, starring as Leah, Leon Liebgold as Hannan (Channon, in the English-language subtitles), and as Rabbi Azrael ben Hodos. The film adds an additional act before those in the original play: it shows the close friendship of Sender and Nisn as young men. Besides the language of the film itself, the picture is noted among film historians for the striking scene of Leah's wedding, which is shot in the style of German Expressionism. The film is generally considered one of the finest in the Yiddish language. "The Dybbuk" was filmed on location in Kazimierz, Poland, and at the Falanga Film Studios in Warsaw.

Freinet classification

The Freinet classification ("To organise everything") is used in the libraries of some elementary schools, and was invented by Célestin Freinet to facilitate the easy finding of documents, and the use of the "Bibliothèque de Travail".
The principles are simple: Everything is split into 12 major divisions. 12 subdivisions along the principles of the Dewey decimal system are then divided into 10, and then 10 again.
Because of its logical classifications based on school work, this classification is seen by some educators to be more natural and more logical to students than official classifications based on organizational criteria. The last revision took place in 1984. It is still used, in addition to keywords, in IT and some data information organization systems.

Anqing Teachers College

Anqing Teachers College (Chinese: 安庆师范学院) is an institution of higher learning, located in Anqing, Anhui Province of the People's Republic of China.
The history of the college dates back to 1897, when the earliest and largest provincial school in Anhui, Jinfu Academy (敬敷书院), was relocated to Linghu Campus. Famed pundits and traditional scholars such as Liu Dagui, Wang Liangwu, Quan Zuwang and Yao Nai, all served as the headmaster (equivalent to president nowadays). In 1898, emperor Guangxu of Qing Dynasty ordered it be renamed as Qiushi Academy (求是学堂). In 1902, it was called Anhui Grand Academy. Later, it became Anhui Military Academy, Anhui Army's Academy, and Anhui Judicial and Political College. In 1928, Anhui Provincial University was formed here. In 1946, it became National Anhui University, and thus attained its climax in Chinese modern history of higher education.
After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, due to the drift of the political center, the school witnessed a series of alterations over the time, though the education mission has never been discontinued. It once became a Navy Academy, a Normal College, and a branch campus of Anhui Normal College. In May 1980, upon the approval of the State Council, it was renamed Anqing Teachers College. In 1998, the college held its 100th anniversary celebration.
In 2010, Anqing Teachers College established a sister institution partnership with Salisbury University in the US state of Maryland.

Fortaleza Ozama

The Fortaleza Ozama (in Spanish; Ozama Fortress in English) is a sixteenth-century castle built by the Spanish at the entrance to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and overlooking the Ozama River. Named after this river, the castle, also referred to as "La Fortaleza" or "The Fortress", is the oldest formal military construction of European origin in America. An impressive architectural structure of medieval style and design, the Tower of Homage (Spanish: Torre del Homenaje) stands in the center of the grounds. The castle was designed to guard the entrance to the port of Santo Domingo and defend the city from seaborne enemies. Construction began in 1502 and it was completed in 1505. The gate on Calle Damas was originally built in 1608. 
The castle was well-built enough to serve as a prison until the 1960s. When the prison was closed, the "Fortaleza" was opened to the public. It is at the end of Las Damas Street.

Hexafluoride

A hexafluoride is a chemical compound with the general formula RpXnF6m- or RpXnF6m+. Many molecules fit this formula. An important hexafluoride is hexafluorosilicic acid (H2SiF6), which is a by product of the mining of phosphate rock. In the nuclear industry, uranium hexafluoride (UF6) is an important intermediate in the purification of this element. Several compounds in organofluorine chemistry are also hexafluorides.
Hexafluoride cations.
Cationic hexafluorides do exist, but are rarer than neutral or anionic hexafluorides. Examples are the hexafluorochlorine, ClF6+, and hexafluorobromine, BrF6+, cations.
Hexafluoride anions.
Many elements form anionic hexafluorides. Prominent members of commercial interest are hexafluorophosphate and hexafluorosilicate; hexafluoroplatinate is rarer, but of interest due to its being able to stabilize uncommon cations. Many transition metals form hexafluorides. Because of its highly basic nature and its resistance to oxidation, the fluoride ligand stabilizes some metals in uncommon oxidation states, such as caesium hexafluorocuprate(IV), potassium hexafluoronickelate(IV), and caesium hexafluoroargentate(IV).
Binary hexafluorides.
Seventeen elements are known to form hexafluorides. Nine of these elements are transition metals, three are actinides, four are chalcogens, and one is a noble gas. Most hexafluorides are molecular compounds with low melting and boiling points. Four hexafluorides (S, Se, Te, and W) are gases at room temperature (25 °C) and a pressure of 1 atm, two are liquids (Re, Mo), and the others are volatile solids. The group 6, chalcogen, and noble gas hexafluorides are colourless, but the other hexafluorides have colours ranging from white, through yellow, orange, red, brown, and grey, to black.
The molecular geometry of binary hexafluorides is generally octahedral, though it is sometimes distorted. Gaseous XeF6 is a fluxional molecule with a distorted octahedral structure, which is, according to VSEPR theory, caused by it non-bonding lone pair. In the solid state, XeF6 has a complex structure involving tetramers and hexamers. According to quantum chemical calculations, ReF6 and RuF6 should have tetragonally distorted structures (where the two bonds along one axis are longer or shorter than the other four), but this has not been verified experimentally.
Chemical properties of binary hexafluorides.
The hexafluorides have a wide range of chemical reactivity. Sulfur hexafluoride is nearly inert and non-toxic due to steric hindrance (the six fluorine atoms are arranged so tightly around the sulfur atom that it is extremely difficult to attack the bonds between the fluorine and sulfur atoms). It has several applications due to its stability, dielectric properties, and high density. Selenium hexafluoride is nearly as unreactive as SF6, but tellurium hexafluoride is toxic, not very stable and can be hydrolyzed by water within 1 day. In contrast, metal hexafluorides are corrosive, readily hydrolyzed and may react violently with water. Some of them can be used as fluorinating agents. The metal hexafluorides have a high electron affinity, which makes them strong oxidizing agents. Platinum hexafluoride in particular is notable for its ability to oxidize the dioxygen molecule, O2, to form dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate, and for being the first compound that was observed to react with xenon (see xenon hexafluoroplatinate).
Applications of binary hexafluorides.
Some metal hexafluorides find applications due to their volatility. Uranium hexafluoride is used in the uranium enrichment process to produce fuel for nuclear reactors. Fluoride volatility can also be exploited for nuclear fuel reprocessing. Tungsten hexafluoride is used in the production of semiconductors through the process of chemical vapor deposition.
Predicted binary hexafluorides.
Radon hexafluoride (), the heavier homologue of xenon hexafluoride, has been studied theoretically, but has not yet been synthesised. Krypton hexafluoride () has been predicted to be stable, but has not been synthesised due to the extreme difficulty of oxidising krypton beyond Kr(II). The synthesis of americium hexafluoride () by the fluorination of americium(IV) fluoride () was attempted in 1990, but was unsuccessful. Palladium hexafluoride (), the lighter homologue of platinum hexafluoride, has been calculated to be stable, but has not yet been produced. Chromium hexafluoride (), the lighter homologue of molybdenum hexafluoride and tungsten hexafluoride, was reported, but has been shown to be a mistaken identification of the known pentafluoride ().

Joe's Pop Shop

"Joe's Pop Shop" was an English comedy that aired on UK Play in 1999. Its central story line revolved around a small record shop run by two inept friends Joe and Ben.
Outline.
Following the arrest of his father Rodney, Joe takes over his father's ailing Camden Town based record shop. Realising that his father is never coming back, Joe enlist the help of his feckless, dishonest best friend Ben. 
Joe (played by Joe Mace) and Ben (played by (Ben Dunn), through a series of hair-brained schemes manage to run the shop even further into the ground. Further plagued by Joe's sexually aggressive mother and a rogue, latent homosexual Austrian tax collector with an unconvincing afro, Joe's job is made all the harder by the presence of two old ladies who live under the record shop's counter who claim the rights of sitting tenants.
Format.
The show ran as 6 half-hour episodes and always featured two music videos contemporary to the time. It also featured a number of scenes shot on outside broadcast, which contributed to its ranking as UK Play's most expensive in-house production.
Complicated rights issues and the move by co-star Joe Mace away from acting and into presenting meant that the second series was never commissioned.
The show was created and written by Joe Mace and Ben Dunn and executive produced by Myfanwy Moore, producer of "Little Britain".

<doc id="19261836" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19261836" title="Photo blanket">
Photo blanket

Photo blanket [blang-kit has two meanings. The more modern definition is a large, rectangular piece of soft fabric displaying images, pictures, or designs, often with bound edges, used as a blanket, especially for warmth as a bed covering or decorative object. Photo blanket also refers to a thick cloth depicting people, objects, and symbols intended to tell a story or reveal historical events.
History.
The photo blanket has a history nearly as long as the history of clothing itself. For thousands of years, people around the world used blankets as a form of communication through storytelling, honoring dead, and a well-respected form of art.
Ancient Egyptians weaved colored threads and sometimes even gold into a fabric (usually linen) or by painting with inks and dyes on papyrus cloth. The cloth (blanket) would often form pictures to tell stories and to honor prominent people or one of the multiple gods of their culture.
Navajo tribes used special indigo dye from Mexico and other vegetal dyes to color multi-ply yarns and weave them into three main types of blankets - a serape (a shoulder covering blanket that is longer than it is wide), a saddle blanket (a blanket that was folded in half under a horse’s saddle for extra cushioning), and a chief's blanket (a shoulder blanket that was made wider than it was long).
Nepalese rug makers - one of the most respected jobs in their society - would use luxurious silks, wools, and hemp to create beautiful works or art. Using vertical looms and fibers dyed with natural vegetal dyes, they form several different types of knots together for a soft and evenly tufted finish.
For hundreds of years, tribes throughout Indonesia and Africa have used a dye and resist technique called batik to create intricate patterns and pictures. During the past two or three centuries batik has become one of the principal means of expression of the spiritual and cultural values of Southeast Asia. Once again used as a form of storytelling and passing down history, picture fabrics and blankets have been an integral part of their culture.
Asian cultures have used weaving and blankets for the same purposes, using gold and other precious metals woven into their cloths and blankets. As an important artistic form, it conveys the history and myths of a culture through iconography and pictures.
Throughout history, photo blankets have been an ever present and fundamental key to communication, decoration, and tradition. Today’s photo blankets have changed to modern techniques and more efficient manufacturing, but the primary meaning has remained very similar. People display meaningful photos that represent memories and reveal history. Adding text or symbols communicate language and add to the blanket’s storytelling aspect.
Uses.
Photo blankets are used throughout the home for displaying pictures and images as objects of decor, for warmth, or to be given and received as gifts.
Uses in home decor include furniture coverings and as decorative displays of a design or photograph. Photo blankets can be used to cuddle up for warmth either in or outdoors. They are often given as wedding, birthday, Christmas, baby, or anniversary gifts to individuals or couples displaying memorable pictures, dates and quotes on them.
Types.
There are three main types of photo blankets - woven photo blankets, knitted photo blankets, and dyed photo blankets.
A woven photo blanket is made on a jacquard loom using digital software that scans a picture, creates a pattern and then creates a woven picture blanket using various colored yarns that interlace at 90 degree angles (see weave). Woven photo blankets, comes in two varieties; an afghan photo blanket and a tapestry photo blanket. The yarn used in the weave of an afghan photo blanket is the same thickness in both horizontal and vertical directions while a tapestry photo blanket is manufactured with yarn of two different diameters. In a tapestry photo blanket the thinner of the two yarns; i.e., the warp, actually consists of 6-8 different color strands of yarn which are combined in various ways, based on a photo, to re-create the colors as accurately as possible (even black and white). 
A knitted photo blanket is made by a machine that uses a similar scanning and pattern process, but instead of weaving the yarns together, knits them together in a looping technique (see knit). Often knitted photo blankets consist of limited colors due to the knitting process and the continuous thread forming loops in the process.
A dyed photo blanket is the newest type of photo blanket and is made by printing dye onto fabric from a digital image (see dye sublimation). This type allows for unlimited colors and has the sharpest picture clarity of the three.

Trees Cry for Rain

Trees Cry for Rain: A Sephardic Journey is a short 1989 documentary that profiles Rachel Amado Bortnick, exploring her Turkish-Jewish heritage.
Summary.
Less than 25,000 Jews still live in Turkey and, unlike their ancestors, they consider themselves more Turkish than Jewish. "Trees Cry for Rain: A Sephardic Journey" uses one woman’s childhood memories to reconstruct what life was like for Sephardic Jews in Turkey before modern assimilation took effect.
Jews were executed or forced to convert under Christian rule in Spain before being forced out of the country. Many fled to nearby Turkey, where, for centuries, they were able to maintain their traditions, passing them down through the generations. "Trees Cry for Rain" shares an intimate interview with Rachael Amado Bortnick, a native of Turkey who left as a young adult, complemented by detailed paintings and illustrations of Turkey, to bring the once-rich culture of Turkey’s Sephardic Jewry to life. Their unique foods, songs, and traditions are explored, and the importance of keeping their unique Judeo-Spanish language alive is impressed upon the viewer.
Sephardic culture continues to be threatened by assimilation, and the Ladino language is in danger of being lost forever. “My generation was the last to speak the language fluently,” Rachael explains. But, thankfully, the culture’s beautiful music has brought about a renewed interest in the unique tongue. Sephardic singer, Judy Frankel practices her pronunciations with Rachael, while she sings, “Trees cry for rain and the mountains for wind; So my eyes weep for you, my dear sweetheart.”
Rachael listens intently and confesses that the song’s refrain reminds her of her own situation. “I turn and I say what will become of me? I will die in a strange land.”
