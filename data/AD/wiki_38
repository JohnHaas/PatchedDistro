Turn-off notice

A turn-off notice, cut-off notice, or shut-off notice is a warning letter sent out by the provider of a service for a residence or other building, such as utility, phone service, or cable television, that if payment is not sent by the date indicated in the notice, the service will be interrupted. Turn-off notices, which are sent after a regular bill has been sent, but may resemble a bill, are generally sent several days to weeks before the planned date, giving the customer a sufficient amount of time to make a payment that would avert the interruption.
Turn-off notices are often sent to those who are economically struggling, thereby having difficulty paying their bills on time, the absent-minded who are able to afford their bills but are disorganized in making timely payments, and to those who are out of commission to pay bills due to personal unforeseen circumstances, such as illness.
In some cases, the turnoff notice may be necessary to obtain government or private aid in paying the bills.
Many turn-off notices encourage the customer to make a payment by some method other than the postal service to ensure that the payment is received before the cut-off date. Some methods of payment that are commonly accepted include check or credit card over the phone or online, or payment at the main office or a satellite location of the service provider, which may charge a fee for accepting the bill.
Averting the turnoff.
It is not uncommon for a customer who receives a turnoff notice to panic or to attempt to avoid the provider while silently dealing with the matter. But the general recommendation is to contact the service provider, which may be willing to grant an extension or otherwise work with the customer to keep payments up to date
For certain types of utilities, such as heating, limited assistance may be available in some places to help customers pay their bills
Moratoriums and laws.
Some local governments have placed temporary moratoriums on utility turnoffs under certain conditions, such as cold weather, the presence of a child, elderly, or sick person, or political controversies.
Some places have laws prohibiting or restricting certain turnoffs altogether. In the U.S. state of Idaho, the law prohibits utilities from turning off service in a residence where a child or dependent elderly person lives, though proof of this is required.

Fermentative hydrogen production

Fermentative hydrogen production is the fermentative conversion of organic substrate to biohydrogen manifested by a diverse group of bacteria using multi enzyme systems involving three steps similar to anaerobic conversion. Dark fermentation reactions do not require light energy, so they are capable of constantly producing hydrogen from organic compounds throughout the day and night. Using synthetic biology, the bacteria are usually genetically altered.
Photofermentation differs from dark fermentation because it only proceeds in the presence of light. Electrohydrogenesis is used in microbial fuel cells.
Bacteria strains.
For example photo-fermentation with Rhodobacter sphaeroides SH2C can be employed to convert small molecular fatty acids into hydrogen.

Paul Wratten

Paul Wratten (born 29 November 1970 in Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, England) is a retired English footballer who played as a midfielder.
He signed for Manchester United on leaving school in the summer of 1987 and made two substitutes appearances late in the 1990-91 season, both in the First Division - the first against Wimbledon, the second against Crystal Palace.
Wratten was given a free transfer at the end of the 1991-92 and was signed by Alan Murray for Hartlepool United, who now found themselves in Division Two (now the third tier of English football) following the creation of the Premier League.
Wratten made 57 first team appearances for Hartlepool United, scoring one goal. His first season began brightly for the club, as they looked like promotion contenders capable of at least a play-off place, but a terrible loss of form in the second half of the season almost resulted in them suffering relegation to Division Three.
1993-94 saw Hartlepool finally relegated to Division Three, and at the end of the campaign new manager David McCreery decided that Wratten was no longer part of the clubs plans and gave him a free transfer. A brief spell at York City followed, but Wratten was released without making a first-team appearance and by the age of 24 his professional career was over, although he continued to play football at non-league level with Bishop Auckland in the Northern Premier League.

Lowndes High School

Lowndes High School is a public high school in Valdosta, Georgia, USA. The school is part of the Lowndes school system, which serves Lowndes County except for the city of Valdosta.
History.
In 1957, voters in Lowndes County approved an $800,000 bond issue and the board got assistance from the State of Georgia for the construction of a new high school.
Lowndes County High School (LCHS) opened in 1959 in the southern portion of the county below Valdosta and served a totally white enrollment of 671 students. In 1961 students from the black high schools, Lowndes County Training School and Webb-Miller consolidated into Westside High School.
In 1966 LCHS and Hahira High School consolidated to form the new Lowndes High School (LHS) and began with an enrollment of 805. The new school was relocated to its present facility on Norman Drive near I-75 in the western side of Lowndes County. The former facility became Lowndes Middle School.
In 1969, when the county integrated their schools, the former black school, Westside High School was also combined into Lowndes. LHS became a comprehensive high school in 1972 and was classified as a Georgia School of Excellence in 1980.
Lowndes High School is now one of the largest high schools in the state of Georgia with a student enrollment of over 3000 students and 170 faculty members.
Expansion.
The facility built in 1966 has undergone multiple expansions to accommodate continued growth in student population.
In 2001, 17 classrooms were added to the freshman building. In January 2002, a $5 million cafetorium was constructed which significantly expanded seating capacity over the former space. The new structure also featured updated cooking and disposal technology and a full multi-purpose stage.
In 2007, a new $8 million gymnasium was completed. The former gym, built in 1966, seated approximately 1,600, while the new facility seats approximately 3,056. The building also contains five classrooms, locker rooms, and coaches offices. The project was funded through SPLOST II and Manley Spangler Smith Architects was the firm that designed the gym.
Along with the gym, in 2007 a new main road entrance to the school was opened on Norman Drive, along with a new front parking lot, and office entrance. The old entrance on St. Augustine Road was closed due to congestion but is still used for large events. JCI Construction of Moultrie built the gym and Rountree Construction of Valdosta built the new entrance on Norman and the new parking lot and portico.
Death of Kendrick Johnson.
In January 2013, three sport athlete Kendrick Johnson was encountered deceased at the school in a rolled up wrestling mat. On October 31, 2013, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia announced they will open a formal review in the death of Johnson.
National Principal of the Year.
On August 26, 2010 Lowndes High Principal Blake Blanton was named the 2011 MetLife/NASSP National High School Principal of the Year. In April, Taylor was named the 2011 Principal of the Year by the Georgia Association of Secondary School Principals and in July was named one of six finalists for the national honor. Taylor received a $5,000 grant to use for either professional development or school improvement projects. The event featured guests such as State Rep. Amy Carter, Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives David Ralston, and Brad Bryant, state superintendent of schools.

In the summer of 2008 Valdosta, Georgia was featured on ESPN as a candidate for Titletown USA. The month-long segment on ESPN started in the Spring of 2008 and continued through July. Fans nominated towns and cities across the country based on their championship pedigree. A panel reviewed the nominees and fan voting in May determined the 20th finalist. SportsCenter visited each city in July, and fan voting July 23–27 determined the winner. On Monday, July 28, 2008 Valdosta was named Titletown, USA by ESPN. The history of athletic accomplishments at Lowndes was a factor in Valdosta achieving the title.
Martin Stadium.
The home field of the Lowndes football team is Martin Stadium, named to honor former Lowndes County Schools Superintendent A.B. "Sonny" Martin. He served 20 years (1960–1980) as the Superintendent of the Lowndes County School System. Prior to that he had served as a teacher, coach and principal of Hahira High School for 10 years.

USS Beaufort (PF-59)

USS "Beaufort" (PF-59) was a acquired by the United States Navy during World War II. Although she was designed as a patrol craft, she was reconfigured and employed as a weather station ship in the North Atlantic Ocean. "Beaufort's" task was to launch weather balloons and transmit weather data via radio to her shore-based commanders.
Constructed in Superior, Wisconsin.
The third U.S Navy ship to be so named, "Beaufort" (PF-59) laid down on 21 July 1943 at Superior, Wisconsin, by the Globe Shipbuilding Co. under a U.S. Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1466); launched on 9 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Elma G. Rodgers; accepted by the Navy on 8 July 1944.
In-service.
"Beaufort" was placed in service for the trip to Boston, Massachusetts; arrived at Boston on 20 July 1944; placed out of service on 29 July 1944; converted to a weather station ship at the Boston Navy Yard; and commissioned on 28 August 1944, Lt. Comdr. George R. Boyce, USCG, temporarily in command.
World War II service.
During the following week, "Beaufort" completed fitting out and received a new commanding officer, Lt. B. R. Henry, USCG. On 8 September, she got underway for a shakedown cruise to Bermuda. 
The ship arrived back at Boston on 6 October. After a nine-day repair period, the patrol frigate headed for Hussey Sound — near Portland, Maine — for five days of training before returning to Boston. Soon thereafter, she sailed for Argentia, Newfoundland. During the remainder of World War II and for some seven months thereafter, she operated out of Argentia as a weather station ship with additional duty as a plane guard and air-sea rescue ship.
Under Coast Guard cognizance.
In March 1946, she was temporarily assigned to the U.S. Coast Guard pending inactivation. "Beaufort" reported to the Commandant, 5th Naval District, on 28 March 1946 and was decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, on 19 April 1946.
Post-war dispositioning.
Her name was struck from the Navy List on 21 May 1946, and she was sold to the Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Company, Chester, Pennsylvania, on 11 April 1947 for scrapping.

Extract (film)

Extract is a 2009 American comedy film written and directed by Mike Judge. The film stars Jason Bateman, Mila Kunis, Kristen Wiig, Dustin Milligan, J. K. Simmons, and Ben Affleck. This was said to be Judge's companion piece to his cult-classic "Office Space." Judge also makes an uncredited appearance as 'Jim', a union organizer.
Plot.
Joel Reynolds is the owner and founder of Reynold's Extract, a flavoring-extracts company. Although his business is successful, his marriage is now completely sexless. His best friend Dean, a bartender and pothead, offers to ease his mind with Xanax and various other drugs, but the straight-laced Joel refuses.
One day, a series of mishaps occurs at the extract factory, resulting in an employee (Step) losing a testicle. Cindy, a con artist and drifter, reads a news story about the accident. Hatching a get-rich-quick scheme, she gets a temporary job at the factory, flirting with Joel in order to manipulate him into giving her more information about Step. She also begins a series of petty thefts from her co-workers, who suspect or openly accuse each other of the thefts. Although Step initially decides not to sue the company, he changes his mind after a "chance meeting" with Cindy (that she sets up in order to meet and flirt with him). Under Cindy's influence, Step hires ambulance-chaser attorney, Joe Adler.
Joel, unhappy in his marriage and mistaking Cindy's manipulations for genuine attraction to him, entertains the idea of an affair with Cindy; however, he still loves Suzie, and wants to avoid actions that would leave him with regrets later. At the bar, Dean suggests that Joel hire a gigolo to seduce Joel's wife, so that Joel can then have a guilt-free affair of his own (as "revenge" for his wife cheating on him, first). Joel initially balks at the idea; but, after his judgment is impaired after ingesting a ketamine tablet that Dean mistakenly told him was just a Xanax, Joel eventually agrees. The friends hire Brad to seduce Suzie into an affair, while posing as the pool cleaner. The next morning, Joel sobers up, realizes what he has done, and tries to stop Brad from going to his house; but by then, Brad and Suzie have already begun an affair. Things backfire further, as Brad falls in love with Suzie and wants to run away with her. After smoking marijuana with Dean and his friend Willie, Joel attempts to call Cindy, but soon realizes that he is calling Willie's number. Just then, Cindy walks into the apartment. Willie realizes that Joel is trying to get with Cindy lives with Willie—they're lovers, and, infuriated, punches Joel in the face.
Joel meets with Adler and his associates, in the factory office, to discuss the terms of the settlement. The workers, believing that the meeting is about a buy-out of the factory by General Mills, organize a strike. Frustrated by Adler's uncompromising negotiating style and the growing disrespect from his employees, Joel storms out and goes home—where Suzie admits her affair with Brad to him. Joel admits to Suzie that he hired Brad to do it, then leaves the house to escape her wrath.
Joel moves into a motel, where he spots Cindy, staying in another room. When he goes to her room, he notices a purse stolen from one of his employees, along with other stolen items, and realizes that Cindy is not only a thief, but is also behind a lot of the company's problems. He begins to leave and call the police, but softens when Cindy confronts him and breaks down in tears. Ultimately, the two spend the night together. The next morning, Cindy disappears, but leaves the stolen items behind.
Step meets with Joel at the factory, where he offers to drop the lawsuit if Joel promotes him to floor manager. Meanwhile, while cleaning the pool herself, Suzie loses her temper with her annoying, overly-talkative neighbor Nathan. She tells him what she really thinks of him, and just as she finishes her tirade, he collapses and dies. Feeling guilty, Suzie attends the funeral, where she runs into Joel. After a few awkward moments, the two share a ride home, hinting at a possible reconciliation. It is revealed that Cindy has scammed Adler, too: she steals his luxury car, leaving him Step's truck in its place.

Shortly after completing the film "Office Space" director Mike Judge was already about 40 pages into his follow-up script, set in the world of an extract factory, when he was convinced by his representative team that he needed to shelve that and concentrate on something more commercial. "The only idea that I had that anyone was interested in was what eventually became "Idiocracy"", says Judge. Over the next several years he focused his energy on developing "Idiocracy". But years later, by the time of the film’s release, audiences had decided that "Office Space" had struck a chord, and they were ready to see Judge get back to on the job humor and thus the "Extract" script was given new life.
Seeking to keep "Extract" below the radar of the studio system, Judge and his producers set up a production company, Ternion Productions, and arranged private financing—while partnering with Miramax for domestic distribution of the film. Judge relied heavily on his own personal knowledge of the industrial world to bring the story to life. “I actually worked in a factory a little bit myself,” the director stated. “I hopefully write stuff that is recognizable as the archetypes of this world.” Keeping true to this baseline of reality, "Extract" was shot in a working factory, in this case a water bottling plant south of Los Angeles, in the City of Commerce. Judge took the authenticity one step further by using the plant’s employees as extras in the scenes’ backgrounds. “Those people were actually running, doing some bottling while we were shooting. There were people working on machines that were so loud in there they couldn’t hear anyone call ‘action’ or ‘cut.’ They were just doing their job.” Shooting on the factory set led Judge to some epiphanies about what made the story resonate for him: “"Office Space" was told from the point of view of the employees looking up at management as the ‘bad guys’. This is told from the point of view of the owner of the place and the workers are the big pain in the butt to him. I think partly it was inspired by that point in my life where I suddenly had a large number of people working for me and realizing you can’t be a ‘cool guy boss’. It just doesn’t work. So this is my more sympathetic take on the boss.”
Marketing.
Leading up to the film's release, Affleck went on a promotional tour of various cities, starting in Vancouver, Washington, on August 20, 2009, and ending in Los Angeles on September 14, 2009.
In effort to promote the film, Judge released a promotional short which featured his characters Beavis and Butt-head who summarize, and critique, the events depicted in the film.
Reception.
Critical response.
"Extract" earned a 63% "fresh" rating from Rotten Tomatoes, based on 179 reviews. The consensus was ""Extract" has some very funny moments and several fine performances, but the film feels slighter and more uneven than Mike Judge's previous work."
Dan Zak of the "Washington Post", called it "the most disappointing American comedy of the decade". 
On the other end of the spectrum, Michael Phillips of the "Chicago Tribune" called it "the funniest American comedy of the summer".
Box office.
"Extract" made $4.3 million during its opening weekend and $7.1 million in its first week of release, with a total worldwide gross of $10,848,783.
Home media.
"Extract" was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on December 22, 2009.

Water's Edge

"Water's Edge" is a song by Seven Mary Three and the second single released from their second album, "American Standard". It was originally included on their independently released debut album, "Churn", in 1994. The single was released in 1996 and became one of the band's most popular songs, reaching #7 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks.
Overview.
The original five minute version of "Water's Edge" was condensed and became the opening track to 1995's "American Standard". It didn't manage to replicate the success of the band's chart-topping debut single, "Cumbersome," but nevertheless charted well and continues to receive radio play. When Seven Mary Three opened for 3 Doors Down on a 2003 tour, the latter group claimed to have covered "Water's Edge" among other 7M3 songs during their early days.
"Water's Edge" details the story behind a bloated corpse being found in a river or creek; it has been said to be inspired by the 1986 film "River's Edge", but this is not well confirmed. Other accounts indicate that the song is based on a book that Jason Ross read while in college at William and Mary. The song's narrator admits that he witnessed a woman being tossed in the water to drown. He recalls seeing her just before a van of people drove up and subdued the woman, but notes that he cannot confess his witnessing the crime out of fear of their power. Musically, "Water's Edge" relies on a soft verse, heavy chorus style. Muted guitar chords and harmonics between verses also offer a delicate side to this dark, aggressive song. During the bridge, the narrator furiously ridicules himself for not intervening with the incident.
Music video.
Thomas Mignone, who would later become known for his heavy metal music videos, directed the symbolic "Water's Edge" video. All band performance and story concept footage was shot in the woods and at a creekside building during winter. The video focuses on a young boy walking through the woods and spotting a suspicious man. The boy opens a tent to see strange hand puppets cavorting amongst one another. This is intertwined with footage of people in large costumes similar to the puppets who are harassing a woman outside. A man is also shown observing through a window in the building before removing a floor cover and heading below. The boy closes the tent and runs away as the video ends.

El Tintal

El Tintal is a Maya archaeological site in the northern Petén region of Guatemala, about northeast of the modern-day settlement of Carmelita, with settlement dating to the Preclassic and Classic periods. It is close to the better known sites of El Mirador ( to the north), to which it was linked by causeway, and Nakbé ( to the northeast). El Tintal is a sizeable site that includes some very large structures and it is one of the four largest sites in the northern Petén; it is the second largest site in the Mirador Basin, after El Mirador itself. El Tintal features monumental architecture dating to the Middle Preclassic similar to that found at El Mirador, Nakbé and Wakna. Potsherds recovered from the site date to the Late Preclassic and Early Classic periods, and construction continued at the site in the Late Classic period. 
The causeway system linking the sites of El Tintal, El Mirador and Nakbé involved a significant labour investment and an enormous quantity of construction materials, indicating an accomplished engineering programme in the Preclassic Period.
Although the site's existence was known to archaeologists for decades, due to its remote location no thorough investigation of the site took place until 2004, when the Mirador Basin Project carried out the first systematic excavations.
Location.
El Tintal is located in the north of the department of Petén, in a remote area still covered by dense virgin rainforest and only accessible by mule trails. The site occupies a hill, with four swampy areas within the site core. The swamps of the Mirador Basin appear to have been the primary attraction for the first inhabitants of the area as evidenced by the unusual cluster of large cities clustered around them.
Occupation.
Ceramic analysis has revealed that El Tintal was most heavily occupied during the Late Preclassic (300 BC – AD 150) and in the Late Classic. Preclassic ceramic finds are of a type found throughout the Mirador Basin, but Late Classic ceramics are of a type distinct from those found at other sites in the basin, suggesting cultural diversion as population levels fell after the Preclassic.
Modern history.
El Tintal was first visited by Heinrich Berlin in the 1950s but it was not until 1970 that test pits were excavated by archaeologists Ian Graham and Joyce Marcus, of the universities of Harvard and Michigan respectively. In 1990 Richard D. Hansen carried out a rescue excavation around Stela 1. The Mirador Basin Project carried out the first systematic excavations at the site in 2004.
The site has been heavily looted, with 2154 looters' trenches cut into the mapped structures, averaging 2.54 trenches per structure. The looters unearthed thousands of burials and have left human remains, ceramics and other arftifacts judged of lesser value scattered throughout the site. A great deal of damage was done by looters mistakenly looking for Classic Period burials in Preclassic structures, resulting in extensive digging when such burials were not found.
The site.
The Mirador Basin Project mapped around the monumental architecture of El Tintal, recording 850 major structures reaching up to high. Wide causeways connected various parts of the site, as well as connecting the city with a network of other sites in the Mirador Basin.
Two of the largest buildings at El Tintal are triadic structures, a Preclassic Maya innovation consisting of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform. These triadic structures have been heavily looted. These extensive looters trenches have failed to locate any tombs or burials. One of the largest pyramids in the site core is a triadic pyramid estimated to have a height of with a massive base measuring .
The site was investigated in 1990 under the direction of archaeologist Richard D. Hansen of the University of California, Los Angeles. The investigations consisted of the rescue excavation of one of the many looters' trenches at the site, the excavated trench having been cut through a high mound upon the high triadic pyramid. The looters' trench had revealed a broken red sandstone stela (Stela 1), which was first reported in 1979 to archaeologists of the El Mirador Project. The remains of the stela were resting upon a stucco floor, a large shell was found nearby surrounded by pieces of jade.
A ballcourt is located north of the triadic pyramid near the centre of the site and is the largest ballcourt yet found in the Maya lowlands.
A jade plaque has been recovered from El Tintal bearing a design very similar to a design from an ear-spool from the nearby Classic Period site of La Muerta.
Mano de León complex.
This complex consists of the civic centre of the city. It is completely surrounded by wide, deep ditch with an average width of , measuring up to deep and with a total length of . Due to the presence of Preclassic residential structures along the edge of the ditch, the ditch is believed to date from that period. The ditch was likely to have been defensive in nature although it is possible that it had other functions, such as supplying water or providing a social or political boundary within the city.
The Mano de León Complex is the most heavily looted area of the city, with 945 looters' trenches mapped by the Mirador Basin Project. An important find in a heavily looted area to the southwest of the complex was that of a painted ceramic vessel in a modified Codex style and dating to around AD 700–750, in the Late Classic. It bears depictions of the Maya Maize God and painted hieroglyphs stating that it was a drinking vessel belonging to Yopaat B'ahlam, an important lord who is named in a variety of texts from Late Classic sites in the Mirador Basin.
Stela 1.
El Tintal Stela 1 was carved from red sandstone, it was found buried within a structure near the northwest corner of the El Pavo pyramid in the Mano de León complex. The stela stood in the plaza for centuries after being carved.
Stela 1 was recarved sometime before the Early Classic Period, with elements of the earlier design surviving on the butt of the monument. The preserved designs on the butt include hundreds of carved lines and symbols forming graffiti in a style typical of Preclassic imagery in the region. The stela was deliberately mutilated during the Late Classic, the surviving parts of Stela 1 depict two feet in profile above a band containing other elements. The stela measures high, wide and thick. It is judged to predate Tikal Stela 29 on stylistic grounds, the latter bears a Maya Long Count date equivalent to a date in AD 292. El Tintal Stela 1 was associated with a circular limestone altar that had been displaced by the looters. The sandstone used for Stela 1 probably came from the Altar de Sacrificios region on the Usumacinta River and implies unusual cultural contacts with this relatively distant region.
La Isla complex.
This complex contains the largest pyramid at El Tintal, measuring high and known as "Catzin".
Henequén Group.
This group has been heavily looted, with 508 looters' trenches mapped by the Mirador Basin Project.

Goldikova

Goldikova (foaled 15 March 2005, in Ireland) is a champion Thoroughbred racemare based in France, although she has raced in the USA and England. She has won fourteen Group One races, with nine victories over colts and geldings. This puts her above Miesque as the only European-trained horse to have won more than 10 Group I races since their introduction in the 1970s. Goldikova is the only horse to win three Breeders' Cup Mile races, winning it in 2008, 2009 and 2010. She was ridden by Olivier Peslier in all of her race starts.
Background.
Goldikova was bred by Alain and Gérard Wertheimer and sired by July Cup winner Anabaa. Her dam, Born Gold, is also the dam of Prix Vermeille winner Galikova, who was sired by champion sire Galileo.
Goldikova was put into training with Freddy Head, former six-times Champion Jockey in France.
Racing career.
2007: two-year-old season.
Goldikova won both of her starts at age two, capturing the Prix de Toutevoie and the Prix de la Lorie at Chantilly Racecourse.
2008: three-year-old season.
At age three, Goldikova began the 2008 season in April, running monthly thereafter. She started with two seconds and a third and loss to Zarkava (in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches and the Prix de Diane), then had three consecutive wins. The first one came in the Prix Chloe, followed by the Prix Rothschild, in which she defeated both the French Classic winner, Darjina, and the British Classic winner, Natagora.
Goldikova's third straight victory of the year came in September at Longchamp Racecourse in the Group 1 Prix du Moulin in which she defeated Darjina and Natagora again as well as top Irish colt Henrythenavigator. She again defeated the males in winning the 2008 Breeders' Cup Mile at Santa Anita Park in California and was a finalist for the Eclipse Award's American Champion Female Turf Horse for 2008.
2009: four-year-old season.
Racing at age four, Goldikova made her first start in May's Prix d'Ispahan, finishing seventh on a soft course. In July, she won England's Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. On 2 August, she won her second consecutive Prix Rothschild at Deauville-La Touques Racecourse. At the same Deauville course on 16 August, Goldikova won her sixth group one race, easily defeating her male counterparts in the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville-La Touques Racecourse. Goldikova then returned to Santa Anita Park to win her second Breeders' Cup Mile, with a different racing style. She was second last for much of the race and at the top of the stretch went five horses wide. Then she changed leads again and surged past Courageous Cat to win in 1:32.26.
2010: five-year-old season.
Following her 2009 Breeders' Cup win at Santa Anita Park, Goldikova was rested at the Head family's Haras du Quesnay in Normandy until mid February, when she was put back in training at Freddy Head's base at Chantilly Racecourse. On 23 May, she won her 2010 debut at Longchamp in the Prix d'Ispahan, finishing up 9.20f (1 1/8m) in 1:49.4 while holding off Byword (who subsequently won the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot) and setting a new stakes record in the process.
In her second start of 2010, on 15 June, Goldikova won the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot, defeating the 2009 winner Paco Boy by a neck in 1:37.74, taking 0.5 seconds off of the stakes record. It was her ninth group 1 victory, and sixth victory against males. On 1 August, Goldikova competed a three-peat of wins in the Prix Rothschild. After she settled in third throughout the race, Oliver Peslier barely had to ask an effort of her before she raced away from the rest of the field. On 15 August in the Prix Jacques Le Marois, two weeks after the Prix Rothschild win, Goldikova suffered her first defeat of the year, second to Makfi. Her connections believed that it was largely because of the very soft ground, which she has shown her extreme dislike for in the past. However, she beat Paco Boy again for the second time.
On 3 October, Goldikova made her final start before the Breeders' Cup Mile, defeating a field of 16 males in the Prix de la Forêt at Longchamp, including Dick Turpin, Paco Boy, and 1,000 Guineas winner Special Duty. By winning, she broke the record set by Miesque for the most Group/Grade I wins ever by a European mare. She made history on 6 November 2010 when she became the first horse to win a Breeders' Cup race three times by winning the Breeders' Cup Mile at Churchill Downs, defeating Champion Turf Horse Gio Ponti by 1 3/4 lengths. On 16 November Goldikova was awarded with two Cartier Racing Awards, Horse of the Year and Champion Older Horse. She became the only horse to win the Champion Older Horse award twice.
2011: six-year-old season.
Goldikova made her six year old debut on 22 May by winning the Prix d'Ispahan for the second time, beating Champion Stakes winner Cirrus des Aigles.
On 14 June Goldikova finished second by ¾ length to Canford Cliffs in the Queen Anne Stakes. Jockey Olivier Peslier was fined for being two pounds overweight when he weighed in. Goldikova won her 14th Group/Grade 1, a European record, when winning her fourth consecutive Prix Rothschild at Deauville. On 15 August, Goldikova attempted to extend her record of Group/Grade I wins to 15 in the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville, France. She did not take to the soft ground, which was the case for this year's Prix Jacques le Marois. Goldikova ran second, beaten a length, to Group I winner Immortal Verse.
Goldikova prepped for the Breeders' Cup Mile in the Group 1 Prix de la Forêt on the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe undercard at Longchamp. She was beaten a head by five time Group 1 winner Dream Ahead. This was Goldikova's final race in France before she headed to her career finale in the USA. On November 4, 2011, Goldikova finished third in the Breeders' Cup Mile, one length behind longshot Court Vision, who edged out Turallure by a nose. Goldikova was attempting to win an unprecedented fourth straight Breeders' Cup Mile. The final time was 1:37.05 over good ground.
Assessment.
Goldikova was officially rated the joint 6th best horse in the world in 2008 on a rating of 125. The only filly rated higher than her was Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Zarkava. In 2009, with a rating of 130, she was rated the second best horse in the world, behind only 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Sea the Stars. Goldikova achieved a rating of 125 in 2010, the joint 11th best in the world and the top rated mare. At the end of the 2011 season she was officially rated as the joint 14th best horse in the world and the 3rd best filly or mare on a rating of 124.
Retirement.
Goldikova was retired from racing immediately after her third place finish in the Breeders' Cup Mile. In early 2012, she was covered by champion sire Galileo at Coolmore Stud in Ireland. On Sunday 3 February 2013, Goldikova gave birth to her first foal, a colt. She will return to Galileo for the 2013 covering season.

Frank M. Ziebach

Frank M. Ziebach (also known by his full name of Francis Marion Ziebach) was a noted political figure in the Dakota Territory during the territorial period from 1861 to 1889. He was a pioneer newspaperman, founding a number of newspapers in the Iowa and Dakota Territories, including the Yankton "Weekly Dakotan" (also referred to as the "Weekly Dakotian") in 1861, which is still published today as the Yankton "Press and Dakotan". He was known as the "squatter governor" of the Dakota Territory. Ziebach County, South Dakota was created in 1911, and is named for him. 
Frank M. Ziebach was born in 1830 in Pennsylvania, and died in 1929 in Yankton, South Dakota at the age of 99. His life spanned the period from the presidency of Andrew Jackson to that of Herbert Hoover.
Early life and marriage.
Frank M. Ziebach was born in 1830 in Union County, Pennsylvania, near Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. He entered the newspaper business by publishing the Lewistown (Pa.) Argus. He married Elizabeth Fisher, of Danville, Pa, and over the course of their married life they had four sons and two daughters.
Iowa 1856 to 1862.
Frank M. Ziebach moved from Pennsylvania to Iowa and in August 1856 he began publication of the "Western Independent" with J. N. Cummings in Sargeants Bluff, eight miles south of Sioux City, Iowa. In 1858 Frank bought out his partner, and moved the equipment to Sioux City, where he commenced publication on July 22, 1858 as the weekly "Sioux City Register". The "Register" declared itself to be a "Democratic" newspaper. In 1859, Frank sold an interest to William Freney and the "Register" was consolidated with the "Sioux City Eagle". The partnership of Ziebach and Freney continued to publish the "Register" until 1862, but in 1861 Frank transferred his interests to Yankton, South Dakota.
The Yankton "Weekly Dakotian" newspaper.
In 1861, Frank M. Ziebach freighted his printing outfit from Sioux City, Iowa to Yankton by team and wagon. He and his partner from Sioux City, William Freney, formed the Dakotian Printing Company in Yankton, and printed the first edition of the "Weekly Dakotian" at Yankton on June 6, 1861. Frank Ziebach was the editor and did a good portion of the practical work besides. He was a master printer and a good journalist.
The papers Ziebach had formed in Iowa were self-proclaimed Democrat newspapers and in early editions the Yankton "Weekly Dakotian" similarly proclaimed itself to be a "Douglas Democrat" newspaper. However, after the elections brought the Republicans to power in the territorial legislature in the fall of 1861, the newspaper switched sides. The newspaper became inactive for a short period, during which Ziebach sold the newspaper to J.C. Trask in March 1862. The Dakotian now re-emerged and declared itself a Republican newspaper, and the Dakotian Printing Company was rewarded by becoming the first "Public Printer" in Dakota, doing the printing for the first Legislative Assembly. 
After the first legislative session the "Dakotian" was sold to George W. Kingsbury, and Frank M. Zieback subsequently rejoined the newspaper as a partner of Kingsbury. Since the Dakotian had been a declared Democrat newspaper when published by Frank Ziebach in 1861, but now had switched its allegiance to the Republicans in 1862, when Ziebach rejoined Kingsbury in the newspaper business "political party prudence" dictated that Ziebach be a silent partner and Kingsbury, a Republican, be the official editor and manager of the paper. These political machinations had their reward, and during the second session of the territorial legislature Ziebach and Kingsbury retained the position of "Public Printer". 
After 1863, the paper passed into the sole possession of Kingsbury. Yankton was the territorial capitol of the Dakota Territory from 1861 until 1883 (when the capitol was moved to Bismarck) and during this period the "Dakotian" grew swiftly with its reporting of the early political wars of Dakota Territory. The paper passed through a number of different ownership entities, and in the following decades other area newspapers become consolidated with the "Dakotian" so that it eventually became known as the "Press and Dakotan" and is still published under that name today in Yankton, South Dakota.
There is a debate about the "first newspaper" in the Dakota Territory. On March 2, 1861 Congress passed the Organic Act that brought the Dakota Territory into being, with Yankton as its capitol. The "Weekly Dakotian" was the first newspaper that was published in the Dakota Territory after the passage of the organic act. However it was the second newspaper in the area that became South Dakota. The first newspaper in what is now South Dakota was the "Dakota Democrat" published in Sioux Falls for about four years starting in 1858.
The Yankton Dakota Militia in the 1862 Indian uprising.
In August 1862 raiding Sioux killed Judge Amedon and his son near Sioux Falls, and shortly thereafter Yankton got news of the massacre in Minnesota by Little Crow. Settlers panicked and came pouring into Yankton with their goods and livestock. A sod stockade was thrown up around the printing offices of the "Dakotian". The stockaded newspaper building became known as "Fort Yankton". The governor called for militia volunteers, and four hundred citizens responded. Frank M. Ziebach was elected Captain of Company A of the Dakota Militia, and George W. Kingsbury, the co-editor at the "Dakotian" became the company orderly sergeant. Frank M. Ziebach became known by the tongue in cheek title of Commander in Chief of the Army at Fort Yankton. Although for Yankton there was almost no fighting (excepting a short clash in the late fall on the outskirts of Sioux Falls), historical memory now recalls dashing images from "the exciting and perilous weeks of the Indian outbreak of 1862, when Yankton was besieged."
Public offices in Iowa and the Dakota Territory, 1868 to 1889.
Frank M. Ziebach went to Dubuque Iowa in 1863 and purchased an interest in the "Dubuque Herald". He returned to Sioux City, Iowa in 1866 and in the fall of that year was appointed register of the land office at Sioux City. He was mayor of Sioux City for two terms 1868–69 and 1869–70. 
He returned to Yankton in 1870, where he again became engaged in the newspaper business. In 1873, he was elected to the office as Superintendent of Schools, but since he did not qualify, another was appointed to fill his place. He was elected mayor of Yankton serving for three terms from 1876 through 1880.
He served as a member of the territorial legislature 1877–78 and 1883–84. When in the 1877–78 territorial legislature, Mr. Ziebach resided in Yankton, and represented Yankton County. When he was in the 1883–84 territorial legislature he resided in Scotland, and represented Bon Homme County.
He was a delegate to the South Dakota state constitutional convention, in 1883. He served as a member of first Yankton’s Board of Education, formed in 1875. He has also held other minor offices in city and territorial government.
From 1861 to 1889, Dakota Territory elected a single non-voting Territorial Delegate for a two-year term to the United States House of Representatives. Each party held bi-annual conventions to nominate their candidate for the office. Frank M. Ziebach attended the Democratic Party Territorial Convention in 1874, and in 1882, serving each time on the influential "Committee on Resolutions". Though not chosen as the Democratic candidate for territorial delegate to the U.S. Congress, in each convention he was nominated for the position and received a substantial number of votes.
The squatter governor.
Frank M. Ziebach is known to history as the “squatter governor” of Dakota Territory. During the first territorial legislative session he presided as the mock "governor" over an informal caucus of territorial leaders who formed a mock legislature. This caucus was known as the "third house". This incident caused Frank M. Ziebach to be referred to as the "squatter governor" (a squatter being a frontier term for a person who holds land by possessing it, or "squatting" on it, without having any formal legal title to the land). The mock leglislature sessions continued sporadically in later years, and Frank M. Ziebach was often called to preside. These mock legislature sessions afforded a good deal of entertainment during the formal legislative sessions. Because he had become known as the "squatter governor" Frank M. Ziebach was popularly referred to as “governor” throughout the latter half of his life.
Candidate for territorial governor, commissioner of U.S. land office, 1886 – 1889.
When Dakota sought admission as a state, an intense debate arose whether the territory would be admitted as the single state of Dakota, or admitted as two states. Politicians became known as "one state" advocates, or "two state” advocates, also called "divisionists". In 1884 Grover Cleveland, a Democrat was elected President of the United States, and in 1886, it fell to him to appoint a governor for the Dakota Territory. Frank M. Ziebach was the overwhelming choice of 90% of the rank and file Democrats in the territory, and extensive petitions were prepared and sent to the President. Frank M. Ziebach went to Washington, and met all the right people, and the Democratic faithful and the candidate confidently expected that he would be appointed governor. However, Frank M. Ziebach was a "two state Democrat" with a reputation as a "pronounced divisionist" and President Cleveland favored a "one state" admission. In 1886 President Cleveland awarded Frank M. Ziebach the consolation prize of appointment as receiver/commissioner of the U.S. Land Office, and in 1887 the President appointed a "one state" candidate as governor. Nevertheless, Frank M. Ziebach continued to advocate for a two state admission, and in 1889 the United States Congress resolved the issue by passage of the Enabling Act of 1889 which admitted North Dakota and South Dakota, along with Montana and Washington.
Later life, and becoming the namesake for Ziebach County.
In 1911, Frank M. Ziebach was honored when Ziebach county in South Dakota was created and named for him. When aged 99, he was elected a "Life Member" of the South Dakota State Historical Society because, "His long residence in the State... (and) his activities on behalf of the growth and development of South Dakota, from earliest territorial days to the present time make him one of the marked figures on the list of our most prominent citizens."
Death and burial.
Frank M. Ziebach died on September 20, 1929, at age 99. His wife predeceased him, dying at Winner on August 8, 1917. Frank M. Ziebach is buried in the Yankton Cemetery at Yankton, South Dakota.
Notes.
In 1862, Frank M. Ziebach was one of the original founders of the Masonic lodge in Yankton. 
The Dakota Territory became an organized governmental unit on March 2, 1861. Upon creation, the Dakota Territory included present day North and South Dakota, and much of present-day Montana and Wyoming; by 1868, creation of the new territories of Montana and Wyoming reduced Dakota Territory to the present boundaries of North and South Dakotas. Increasing population caused the Dakota Territory to be divided in half, and a bill for statehood for North Dakota and South Dakota (as well as Montana and Washington) titled the Enabling Act of 1889 was passed on February 22, 1889.
On February 1, 1911, Governor Vessey signed the bill creating Ziebach County. However, being the namesake of Ziebach County has become a rather dubious honor, as the county has consistently retained the title of "poorest county in America" for a number of years.
If the Dakota Territory had been admitted as one state in 1889, instead of two states (North and South Dakota), its land area (383,177 km2) would have made it the fourth largest state, after Alaska, Texas and California, just edging out Montana (381,176 km2).
Before Frank M. Ziebach became known as the "squatter governor" of the mock territorial session in 1862, there were other squatter governments. Before the 1861 founding of the Dakota Territory, there were extralegal "squatter governments" devised by speculators from Dubuque and St. Paul who combined to start a political movement at present-day Sioux Falls, and began agitating for the creation of a new Dakota territory. Prior to this time, any new non-slave territory was opposed by the southern members of Congress unless offset by a new slave territory. However, in 1861 the prospect of secession by southern states after the 1860 presidential election removed this obstacle to political change. Lame duck Democrats in Congress and defeated president James Buchanan claimed a final legacy by extending legal authority to create territorial governments. Thus, these early unofficial "squatter governments" gave a semblance of order, before organized government was formed, and helped provide the impetus to create the Dakota Territory.

Ricky Burns

Ricky Burns (born 13 April 1983) is a Scottish professional boxer from Coatbridge, who fights in the lightweight division and is a former the WBO Lightweight champion. He is also a former WBO Super-Featherweight champion, Commonwealth super featherweight champion and has previously challenged for both the British and European titles. He is considered to be one of the "nice guys" of boxing and a superb role model.
Career.
Early career.
Burns first fight as a professional was a four round victory in October 2001 over Woody Greenaway at the Thistle Hotel in Glasgow, Scotland. On 12 December 2004, following a string of seven wins over opponents including Jeff Thomas, Ernie Smith and Daniel Thorpe he was matched against fellow unbeaten prospect Colin Bain. The fight, at the Marriott Hotel in Glasgow, resulted in a first career defeat for Bain as Burns won over the six round distance. For Burns, the win set him up for a journey south of the border to face the unbeaten British lightweight champion Graham Earl in a non-title fight. The fight with Earl took place at the Wembley Conference Center and Burns produced one of the upsets of the year when he scored a points victory to beat Earl over eight rounds.
Title fights.
The win against Earl meant he would land a shot at the big time when in February 2006, he took on reigning British, Commonwealth and European champion Alex Arthur. The fight took place in Edinburgh and ended in defeat for Burns, as Arthur retained on points. Burns who was still only a 12-fight novice at this stage took the fight to Arthur prompting the champion to heap praise on him; "Ricky Burns was in superb shape and he was up for the fight" said Arthur, "He's a brilliant boxer with a great future and he could be a world champion one day." Burns himself refused to be disappointed with the loss saying; "I don't count that as a loss. I'm just 22 and it was great experience for me".
Burns next had a crack at the British title almost exactly a year later when in February 2007, he met reigning champion Carl Johanneson at the Town Hall in Leeds. The fight ended once again in defeat with Burns losing a 12 round decision to the experienced champion. Johanneson intent on winning well before his home crowd hounded Burns throughout the fight and managed to knock Burns down three times.
New challenges.
After the defeat to Johanneson, Burns took the decision to leave his old boxing club in a bid to seek a new challenge. Burns had worked with Rab Bannan at the Barn Boxing Club for over 14 years, but the Johanneson defeat prompted a need for a change of direction. On telling his former mentor the news Burns said; "It was a nightmare having to tell him. It was really sad because I’ve been with him for 14 years. All my boxing life really. It was really hard but we left on good terms and we shook hands and I’m sure our paths will cross again." Burns moved to the Dalmarnock gym in Glasgow, where he could train alongside the likes of Willie Limond and Kenny Anderson.
Since the fight with Johanneson, Burns won eight fights in a row. A ten round win over Romanian Gheorghe Ghiompirica at the Thistle Hotel in Glasgow gave him the lightly regarded British International Masters belt. Burns also spent time sparring former opponent Alex Arthur in preparation for Arthur's WBO Super-Featherweight title defence against Nicky Cook.
Commonwealth champion.
In September 2008, Burns was in line for a crack at the vacant Commonwealth title, a belt which had been given up by Londoner Kevin Mitchell. The challenge took place at the York Hall in Bethnal Green and saw Burns outpoint the Ghanaian Osumana Akaba over 12 rounds. The fight which was taken with only weeks notice after the original main event on the card was cancelled propelled Burns into the championship frame. Speaking of his future ambitions Burns said; "There is only one fight I want at the moment. That fight would be the current British champion Kevin Mitchell. He recently has been injured, and won't be back until December so we'll have to see what happens".
Burns defended his crown at Glasgow's Kelvin Hall soon afterwards in November 2008, against another Ghanaian, Yakubu Amidu. The African fighter had a record of 16–1–1, with all his victories coming by way of stoppage. Burns however was too much and his superior fitness levels showed as the referee stopped the contest in the seventh round handing victory to the Scotsman. Burns second defence took place in March 2009, and saw Burns halt former British champion Michael Gomez in the seventh round. On 20 June 2009, Burns made perhaps the toughest defence of his title yet with a hard fought 12 round win over Northern Ireland's Kevin O'Hara. with the assistance of the highly experienced trainer Billy Nelson and his Fighting Scots Gym in Stepps. Ricky became Billy's first world champion.
Super featherweight World champion.
Burns success in the ring had elevated him to the number one ranking with the World Boxing Organization's rankings. Burns' promoter Frank Warren tried to negotiate a match with the reigning champion Roman Martinez. The bout with the Puerto Rican champion had been subject to numerous delays with the fight scheduled for both Scotland and Puerto Rico at various intervals only for the fight never to materialise and for Martinez to make a voluntary defence of his title instead. The uncertainty for Burns meant that a proposed British title contest against Gary Sykes never happened with Sykes winning the title against Burns replacement Andy Morris and defending against the man Burns had defeated in his last Commonwealth title defence Kevin O'Hara. Finally after almost a year of frustration Burns re-entered the ring on 15 May 2010, on the undercard of Kevin Mitchell's world title shot against Michael Katsidis at the Boleyn Ground. Burns continued his winning streak and kept ticking over with an eight round win over journeyman and former foe Youssef Al Hamidi. Burns claimed after the fight that he hoped the fight with Román Martinez would materialise around July and that it would be in Glasgow.
The WBO super-featherweight title showdown between Burns and Roman Martinez was eventually confirmed on 24 June 2010 and scheduled to take place at the Kelvin Hall, Glasgow on 4 September. Speaking at the announcement of the fight Burns said; "this has been dragging on a bit..it is the biggest fight of my career but I'm more than confident that I can beat him". Finally on 4 September, Burns entered the ring at Kelvin Hall to face the WBO's unbeaten reigning world champion Roman Martinez. Martinez had held the title for over a year winning it from Englishman Nicky Cook and defending twice against Colombian Feider Viloria and Argentinian Gonzalo Munguia. Despite suffering a knockdown in the first round, Burns took the fight to the champion winning on all three judges scorecards 115–112, 115–112 and 115–113 to inflict a career first defeat on Martinez and finally winning the world title.
Speaking of the fight, Burns promoter Frank Warren said; "this was the best night I've ever had in Scotland and I've had some great shows with Scott Harrison and Alex Arthur as well as bringing Nigel Benn and Frank Bruno up here." Describing the atmosphere at the Kelvin Hall as "electric" he went on to praise Burns, who in winning the title had become Scotland's 12th world champion, saying Scotland had a new "sporting hero" and that the win would lead to a renaissance in Scottish boxing. It also transpired that before the fight the manager of Celtic, Neil Lennon had called to wish Burns the best and sent him a Celtic strip signed by the whole of the first team as a good luck present.
Title defences.
On 4 December 2010, Burns defended his title for the first time against Norwegian boxer Andreas Evensen who held the WBO inter-continental belt at featherweight. The fight, at the Braehead Arena in Glasgow, resulted in another unanimous points win for Burns with the Scotsman also scoring a knockdown in the first round. On 12 March 2011, Burns made his second defence again at the Braehead Arena. His opponent the Ghanaian boxer Joseph Laryea had won the WBO Inter-Continental title win a victory over Scotsman Paul Appleby on the same night that Burns beat Evenson. The fight was stopped in the 7th round after Laryea withdrew citing a broken knuckle with Burns ahead in the fight. Burns' next defence was scheduled for 16 July 2011 and against former WBO Champion Nicky Cook, in Liverpool's Echo Arena. The fight resulted in a 93 second stoppage for Burns as Cook's corner threw in the towel following an injury to his back. After only six seconds a punch from Burns resulted in Cook receiving a count and complaining of back trouble. Cook was sent to the canvas twice more before his corner retired the boxer handing a third straight defence of the title to Burns who said that he would like to fight the South African boxer Mzonke Fana next.
Burns was next scheduled to meet mandatory challenger, and "Boxrec" No. 1 rated Super featherweight, Adrien Broner, but announced on 22 September 2011 that he would be relinquishing his WBO Super featherweight title and moving up to compete at lightweight. Burns said that the move up a weight division would ease the pressure of having to control his weight saying "the last couple of fights it was getting harder and harder for me to do it." Adrien Broner commented on the situation, saying, "You vacated the title talking about you couldn't make weight no more. But you just fought four times and defended this title," Broner further said, "But everyone knows boxing is a game where you can duck fighters... and I guess he felt like running away was best for his career."
Move to Lightweight.
In his first fight at the weight it was announced that Burns would fight Australian Michael Katsidis in London for the WBO interim lightweight title. Speaking of the fight Burns said that it would definitely be the toughest of his career saying "I don't think they could have got me a harder fight if they tried, he's been in with the best of the weight, he's proved himself, obviously he's one of the best in the division and it's a great chance to get out there and show what I can do." On 5 November 2011, Burns took on Katsidis for the WBO interim lightweight championship and despite being the slight underdog went on to win the fight by unanimous decision. After the fight Burns claimed to have "proved a lot of people wrong" as some people "thought Michael would walk all over me". Speaking of the fight he added "Michael didn't give me a minute, he kept coming forward but I'd prepared for that. I'm doing my job and that's the way I always look at it."
On 26 January 2012, Burns was installed as WBO Lightweight champion after former champion Juan Manuel Márquez moved up a division to Welterweight. Ricky defended his WBO Lightweight title against Namibian fighter Paulus Moses. He will have the homefield advantage with the fight being held in Braehead Arena, Glasgow. Burns said, “It's great news about the title but it's back to reality and training hard for what will be a tough title defence against Moses in my homecoming in Scotland. “For the last 10 years I’ve been grafting away in my career. But in the last couple of years it has really taken off with me beating Roman Martinez and then beating a great warrior like Katsidis to put me up there with the best in the world.” Ricky would go on to successfully defend his title via a unanimous points win, with Moses outboxed by Ricky, who was awarded victory 119–110,120–110,117–111 by the three judges.
Kevin Mitchell.
In June 2012 it was confirmed after months of negotiations that Burns' next fight will be another defence of his WBO Lightweight title, against former WBO Inter-Continental Lightweight champion Kevin Mitchell on 22 September 2012. In front of a sold out Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre Burns turned in a career best performance to defeat Mitchell via fourth-round TKO. Burns looked the much bigger man on fight night and seemed to recognise this adopting a more aggressive style, he was gaining control of the fight by the 4th round out boxing Mitchell he would go on to Knock Mitchell down twice in Round 4 in the last minute of round 4 and a further onslaught forced the referee to stop the fight. Burns not known as a puncher made a big statement in this fight that he may be the best 135 pounder in the world.
Cancelled fights.
On 15 December 2012, Burns was expected to defend his WBO Lightweight title against Liam Walsh at the ExCeL, London. Walsh was later involved in a car crash and had to pull out. Walsh's replacement was revealed to be Jose Ocampo. Ocampo however, had to pull out due to death of his trainer. then followed an announcement from Burns that he would not be competing in London on that date after not being able to find an opponent in time. With promoter Frank Warren unable to secure an opponent for a rescheduled date of 26 January 2013, Burns declined the opportunity of an exhibition bout, deciding instead to take a long rest between fights.
Vazquez fight and promotions change.
On 4 March 2013, the unification fight between Burns and Miguel Vazquez (which was originally scheduled for 16 March 2013) was postponed to 20 April 2013 because Vazquez was suffering from a viral infection. Burns was due to defend his WBO title while also challenging for Vazquez' IBF title. The Vazquez fight was also called off with Burns manager Alex Morrison telling The Scotsman "I doubt very much that fight was ever going to happen – leading to an announcement on 7 March 2013 that Burns had left Frank Warren's promotion stable. 
Title defences.
On 11 March 2013 it was confirmed that Burns had joined Eddie Hearne's Matchroom promotions and fought for the first time under Matchroom on 11 May 2013, when he faced Puerto Rican Jose Gonzalez at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow, a fight broadcast on Sky Sports
. Burns won the fight in the ninth round after being outboxed in the first 6 rounds however the fight took a drastic change in round 7 where Burns was hurt before firing back in true championship style, Burns dominated rounds 8 & 9. Gonzalez refused to come out for the tenth round citing a damaged wrist for pulling out of the fight despite being 87-84 ahead on all 3 cards. 
Burns's promoter Eddie Hearn announced that Burns would fight again in September 2013 against Raymundo Beltran of Mexico at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. Burns was knocked down in the 8th round. The bout ended in a controversial split-decision draw as many observers believed Beltran had won. The draw meant Burns retained his WBO Lightweight title. It was confirmed after the fight that Burns had broken his jaw as early as the second round. After having surgery the following day it was unsure when, and if, Burns would be able to fight again, but after the surgery was successful, Burns expressed interest in a rematch with Beltran. However, the WBO installed Terence Crawford as Burns's mandatory challenger and the bout took place on March 1st 2014, where Crawford defeated Burns by unanimous decision to win the WBO Lightweight title.

At his final Olympics in 1968, McNeil competed in the 100 metres once again but failed to pass the first round. His 100 metres personal best is a run of 10.54 seconds set in 1964.
Among his other sprinting achievements were a number of medals from the British West Indies Championships. He took the 200 m silver at the 1964 Championships, but his greatest haul came at the following year's event, where he finished just behind Lennox Miller for the 100 m silver medal and beat Clifton Bertrand, a two-time champion, to the 200 m gold with a run of 20.8 seconds.

Roger Freed

Roger Vernon Freed (June 2, 1946 – January 9, 1996) was a Major League Baseball outfielder and pinch hitter. He played all or part of eight seasons between and for five major league teams.
Early life.
Freed was one of four children of William and Margie Freed. He was a four-sport athlete at Baldwin Park High School in Baldwin Park, California and attended Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, California.
Playing career.
Orioles.
Freed was originally signed by the Baltimore Orioles in and played in their farm system for five years. In 1970, he was voted the Most Valuable Player in the International League while playing for the Rochester Red Wings. His first major league call-up was in September and he made his playing debut on September 18, 1970 starting in right field and batting cleanup, going 0-for-4 in a 5-4 Orioles' loss to the Cleveland Indians. His first hit came two days later, a single off the Indians' Phil Hennigan. Freed went 2-for-13 in four games with one RBI. Freed was thought of highly enough that offseason to be traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for starting pitcher Grant Jackson and two other players,
Phillies.
In , the Phillies installed Freed as their regular right fielder. Over the course of the season, however, he slowly saw less and less playing time, and he would up playing 100 games that season, batting .221. That would be the closest Freed ever came to being a major league regular.
Freed spent coming off the bench as a pinch hitter. Freed did appear in more games in right field for the Phillies than anyone else, but his total was only 45 games as the Phillies rotated Tommy Hutton, Mike Anderson, Oscar Gamble and Bill Robinson through the position as well. That winter, the Phillies shipped Freed and Gamble off to the Cleveland Indians for another outfielder, Del Unser.
Back in the minors.
Freed never played a game for the Indians, spending all of in the minors. He was then traded to the Cincinnati Reds for pitcher Steve Blateric. He played in six games for the Reds in , and then had his contract sold to the Sultanes de Monterrey in the Mexican League.
He played in Mexico for all of , but resurfaced with the Montreal Expos in . Playing for the Denver Bears, he received his second minor league MVP award, this time in the American Association. Once again, a minor league MVP would earn Freed a September call-up, and Freed appeared in eight games in September for the Expos, going 3-for-15. At the end of the season, he was once again sent back to the minors, but in December he was rescued by the St. Louis Cardinals, who selected him in the rule 5 draft.
Cardinals.
.400 (almost).
On the last day of the season, his average was .402, and he could have sat on the bench that last day and kept his average above the magical mark. However, the Cardinals were down 6–3 against the New York Mets going in the 9th, and had put a rally together. A double by Mike Tyson, a walk by Mike Anderson, and a single by Mike Phillips had brought the Cardinals to within 6–4 with one out. The Mets removed pitcher Paul Siebert and replaced him with Rick Baldwin, and Baldwin was able to get Mike Potter to fly out. The Cardinals' pitcher, Al Hrabosky was due up, and Freed was called upon to pinch hit. Unfortunately, Freed grounded into a force play, and ended both the game and his chance at .400, winding up with an average of .398.
In Strat-O-Matic baseball, Roger Freed's 1977 card is often used to play "stratball", or to use a player with great stats but a small sample size to improve one's lineup dramatically.
Remaining career.
Freed spent two more seasons with the Cardinals. In , he had 20 RBI in just 92 at bats, but his batting average had sunk to .239. Freed had another disappointing season in , although he did have one memorable moment, hitting a two-out, game-ending grand slam homer in the bottom of the 11th inning to beat the Houston Astros 7–6 on May 1, 1979.
Freed was released during spring training in . He was signed to a minor league contract by the Phillies, but he never played in the major leagues again.
Death.
Freed died at age 49 on January 9, 1995 in Chino, California.

Ciclacillin

Ciclacillin (INN) or cyclacillin (USAN), trade names Cyclapen, Cyclapen-W, Vastcillin, and others, is an aminopenicillin antibiotic. Its spectrum of activity is similar to that of ampicillin, although it is less susceptible to beta-lactamases than ampicillin and has much higher bioavailability. A large randomized, double-blind clinical trial published in 1978 also showed that ciclacillin is associated with significantly fewer and milder adverse effects than ampicillin; later studies seemed to confirm this improved tolerability, at least in children.
Ciclacillin has been superseded by newer antibiotics and is no longer in clinical use, at least in the United States.

William Gordon (physician)

William Gordon (1800–1849) was a physician and Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, associated with Christian temperance and social causes in the English city of Hull in the early 19th century.
Gordon was born at Fountains Hall near Ripon, in Yorkshire, England on 2 August 1800 and educated at the Grammar School in Ripon. On leaving school he was articled to a general practitioner at Otley. He further studied medicine at London and Edinburgh, and set up a medical practice at Welton in Northumberland. In 1832 he was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, and completed his M.D. in 1841. 
Settling in Hull as a fully qualified physician, he became closely involved with Christian movements and as an active advocate of many of the claims put forwards by the working classes, became known as 'the poor man's friend'. His only child, Charlotte, was born at Welton in 1828. When only four years old he taught her elements of Latin and botany, and thought it "a disgrace that the education of ladies should be merely that of superficial accomplishments", sending her to London for an education and writing to her every day enclosing botanical specimens. She was married at the Albion Chapel, Hull on 14 April 1846, to the chapel's Congregational pastor Christopher Newman Hall.
Towards the end of his life Gordon became president of the Hull Christian Temperance Society. His funeral sermon was preached in Albion Chapel, Hull by his son-in-law Christopher Newman Hall, and published. A public subscription monument was raised over his grave in his honour. An obelisk of white marble, it stood twenty-five feet high and was inscribed: "Erected by public subscription, to William Gordon, M.D., F.L.S. - the People's Friend. Ob. Feb. 7 1849".

Club career.
Born in Styria, Sabitzer started his professional career at Alpine Donawitz and scored 9 goals for them in his debut Bundesliga season.

Asclepias cordifolia

Asclepias cordifolia is a species of milkweed commonly called heart-leaf milkweed or purple milkweed (a common name shared with another milkweed, "Asclepias purpurascens"). It is native to the western United States (California, Nevada, Oregon), growing between elevation in the northern Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges. Heart-leaf milkweed was valued by the Native American Miwok tribe for its stems, which they dried and processed into string and rope.
Description.
Heart-leaf milkweed is a perennial that grows to a height of , with dark red-purple flowers whose hoods are slightly elevated above the base of the corolla. The flower structure is unusual—it has five stamens fused into a column, with five circular attachments called 'hoods', and an anther head surrounding the large stigma at the flower's center. The fruit (photo at left) is a follicle with many flat seeds that have silky hairs which disperse easily in the wind. The large opposite leaves are cordate, or heart-shaped. The plant grows in open or shaded woodland, often on rocky slopes and in mixed coniferous forest. The milkweeds are named for the milky sap which exudes from the plant's stem.
Taxonomy.
The species name, "cordifolia" (Latin for 'heart-leaved'), refers to the heart-shaped leaves, while the genus name honors the Greek physician Asclepius.
Monarch butterfly.
Monarch butterfly caterpillars are commonly found on all the milkweeds, including the heart-leaf milkweed. Even after the caterpillar has metamorphosed into a butterfly, the alkaloids they ingest from the plant are retained in the butterfly, making it unpalatable to predators.
Uses.
The Miwok gathered heart-leaf milkweed in the summer and dried it, or collected it in the fall after it was already dry. The dry stems were combed with a loop of willow to draw out the fiber just beneath the very thin outer skin. The fiber was wound into balls for storage and later processing. The making of cordage (rope and string) was done entirely by hand, with no tools. "Asclepias" was also used by the Native American Yokut or Mariposa in northern and central California for string or rope.
A single Miwok feather skirt or cape was made with approximately 100 feet of cordage, requiring about 500 plant stalks. A 40-foot-long deer net contained about 7,000 feet of cordage, requiring the harvesting of approximately 35,000 plant stalks. The milkweed stalks were burned in the fall to eliminate dead stalks and stimulate the next year's growth, and to stimulate flower and seed production. Cordage was typically two-ply, though there are some examples at the Field Museum of three- and four-ply Miwok cordage.
Heart-leaf milkweed was also used as a contraceptive and snakebite remedy, though without proper preparation it can cause vomiting in low doses and death in higher doses due to a mix of cardenolides in the sap. At one time it was classified as a noxious weed because of reported negative effects on livestock.

Subhelic arc

A subhelic arc is a rare halo, formed by internal reflection through ice crystals, that curves upwards from the horizon and touches the tricker arc above the anthelic point. Subhelic arcs are a result of ray entrance and exit through prism end faces with two intermediate internal reflections. 
Formation.
A subhelic arc is formed when sun rays enter one end face of an ice crystal in singly oriented columns and Parry columns, reflect off two of the crystals side faces, and exits the crystal through the opposite end face. The ray leave the crystal in the exact opposite angle, resulting in a net deviation angle of 120°, the angle for the formation of 120° parhelia. 
The subhelic arc touches the top of the tricker arc, an indication the two have closely related ray paths.
The subhelic arc crosses the parhelic circle in an acute angle, and at a sun elevation of 27° it passes exactly through the 120° parhelion.

Political positions of Cynthia McKinney

Cynthia McKinney, six-term United States Congresswoman, was the 2008 Green Party presidential candidate.
Economic policy.
Defense spending.
McKinney believes the defense spending of the United States is too high and unreasonable. She believes the budget should have been raised after the September 11th attacks, but if they were used properly they could now be lowered. 
Tax reform.
McKinney has voted no on tax cuts for small businesses, income tax, capital gains, dividends, and estate tax, but she did vote to eliminate the marriage penalty.
Free trade.
McKinney wants to put a stop to free trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and Central America Free Trade Agreement. She also is unsupportive of Fast Track, giving China a most favoured nation status, and the World Trade Organization.
Health care.
Cynthia McKinney supports single-payer health care. She also wants to eliminate insurance from health care and believes affordable health care is part of national security.
She also believes if medication is cheaper internationally, then citizens should be able to purchase it. She also supports cheaper drugs in the U.S. through federal negotiation and opposes uniform sterilization.
Financial crisis & bailout.
She is against the $700 billion bailout to Wall Street. She offered a counterpart plan, "A Gift for a Generation," that includes: a moratorium on foreclosures; elimination of all adjustable-rate mortgages and their renegotiation into 30- or 40-year loans; establishment of new mortgage lending practices to end predatory and discriminatory practices; establishment of criteria and construction goals for affordable housing; redefinition of credit and regulation of the credit industry so that discriminatory practices are completely eliminated; full funding for initiatives that eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in home ownership; recognition of shelter as a right according to the UN's Declaration of Human Rights; target funds to cushion job loss and provide for retraining of those at the bottom of the income scale as the economy transitions; close all tax loopholes and repeal of the Bush tax cuts for the top 1% of income earners; fairly tax corporations, denying federal subsidies to those who relocate jobs overseas repeal NAFTA; appoint former Comptroller General David Walker to fully audit all recipients of taxpayer cash infusions, including JP Morgan, Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG, and to monitor their trading activities into the future; eliminate all derivatives trading; nationalize the Federal Reserve and establish a federally-owned, public banking system that makes credit available for small businesses, homeowners, manufacturing operations, renewable energy and infrastructure investments; and criminally prosecute any activities that violated the law, including conflicts of interest that led to the current crisis.
Technology.
In 2005 McKinney voted to support the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005-- which penalizes companies or people for obscene, or other grotesque broadcasting. She also wants America to adopt the Canadian Broadcasting Company's principles and co-sponsored the Anti-Spamming Act, which punished criminals for spamming online. 
Network neutrality.
In June, 2006 McKinney voted to create U.S. network neutrality. This follows her stance for a non-discriminatory nation.
Foreign policy.
Israel and Palestine.
McKinney believes the United States should start listening to Israeli and Palestinian officials, not to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. She believes the United States should not decide a 2-state policy, but instead ask the advocates in the Middle East. She says that she opposes "the Israeli occupation of and genocidal policies toward Palestine." 
Iraq War.
Cynthia McKinney is a supporter of pacifism through diplomacy. She believes the war in Iraq was the United States' way of getting Iraq's natural resources. She states that the only thing separating this war from brutal wars of the past is that now we have more technology. She states the war is immoral and illegal, and that troops should be pulled out of Iraq immediately.
Kosovo.
Cynthia McKinney voted yes to prevent the United States from invading Kosovo in 1999. She also wants to close United Nations psychiatric hospitals in Kosovo because there is proof many prisoners have been raped and beaten in front of apathetic staff in the facility.
Nuclear weapons.
Cynthia McKinney supports the reduction of nuclear weapons in the U.S. She is a strong supporter of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all nuclear explosions for every circumstance everywhere, and also honors the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. She also wants to re-enter the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which was an agreement removed under George W. Bush in 2002 after it had limited anti-ballistic missile systems used to protect nuclear weapons in the U.S. and Soviet Union. She also wants to ban the manufacture and use of depleted uranium. Other nuclear plans she disproves of are the "Star Wars" and "Nukes in Space" plans.
Pakistan.
"Free and fair elections, not U.S. troops, are the best strategy for achieving peace and stability in Pakistan." is the belief of Cynthia McKinney in Pakistan. McKinney has met with former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto - although she has refused to meet with former President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf because she believed he was a dictator - and feels that the United States would be very useful to Pakistan to help end skewed elections. She hopes that America does not declare war on Pakistan only because of the aftermath of Bhutto's resign. 
Czech Republic.
Cynthia McKinney is in strong favor of the citizens of the Czech Republic with their anti-Star Wars missile strikes. She states that the George W. Bush Administration has deceived the citizens of the Czech Republic, who participated in a hunger strike in order to hault the program. In a letter of apology to the Czech Republic, she stated "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once remarked that the United States was the greatest purveyor of violence on the planet. Sadly, that has not changed."
Cuba.
McKinney has voted to keep travel restrictions on United States' citizens until Cuba has released all political prisoners and extradited all criminals sought after by America. 
Energy and environmental policy.
Energy dependence.
"Leave the oil in the soil." is McKinney's main philosophy on energy dependence, stating that this approach would push the economy to creating jobs and using environmental technology to use as energy.
ANWR.
McKinney has opposed Arctic National Wildlife Refuge drilling, and in 2001 supported permanently preserving Alaska's ANWR. 
Alternative energy sources.
Ethanol as energy.
In her own words, McKinney states "I viewed Stockton’s corn fields now primed to supply the newly constructed ethanol plant instead of satisfy human food needs." She, as well as other Greens, believe ethanol should not be the main focus of alternative energy because it will lessen the food supply.
Nuclear and carbon power.
McKinney has maintained the stance that the United States should become nuclear power and carbon power free. She says that there are safer and more effective ways to get clean energy in America besides nuclear power, mainly because the waste cannot be disposed of properly. She called it a "carbon-intense way to boil water." 
Everglades.
Early in her career, McKinney voted against the Florida Everglades Amendment, an amendment that would make taxpayers responsible for repairing the damage done by sugar-growing on the Everglades. Seeing as Green politics is the main stance of the Green Party, Cynthia McKinney supports the preservation of the Everglades.
Social policy.
Abortion.
McKinney is a firm believer of abortion rights. She opposed bills that would have restricted interstate travel for minors looking for an abortion, made it a crime to harm a fetus while committing another crime, and banned Family Planning in the U.S. and globally. She also voted in 2000 against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which came into effect in 2003. In 2001 she was on EMILY's List, a pro-choice group, and in 2006 she received the lowest possible score on the pro-life group National Right to Life Committee's scale assessing politicians record on the issue of abortion. 
Affirmative action.
McKinney feels that affirmative action should be kept in college admissions, which resulted in her voting no on the Higher Education Amendments Act of 1997 that would have made it so every form of post-secondary education would disregard race. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People gave McKinney a 97% pro-affirmative action stance. 
Crime.
It is the main focus of McKinney's stance on crime that capital punishment should be replaced with life imprisonment. She has voted no on bills that would make death penalty appeals harder and the prosecution and sentencing of juvenile delinquency. She has voted yes on bills that would keep habeas corpus rights in death penalty appeals, as well as yes on bills to replace the death penalty and finding alternative sentences to capital punishment. She also supports stronger sentencing for hate crimes.
Education.
McKinney is a strong supporter of education. She has often stated that it is wrong public education receives $38 billion annually while the Pentagon receives $700 billion annually. She also believes reforms like No Child Left Behind hurt the education system, and that free higher education and better primary education is what will improve school systems throughout the nation. She also voted yes on a substitute bill to lower student loan interest rates and increase black college and Hispanic college quality and quantity. She voted yes on a bill for state-testing and voted no on bills to allow vouchers in the District of Columbia, allowing vouchers in private schools and parochial schools, and no on a bill that would only give federal aid to schools that allowed school prayer.
Immigration.
McKinney believes that there should be no skilled worker visas, but that there should be no separation barrier between the U.S. and Mexico or Canada. She also believes it is unjust to say that illegal immigrants have stolen jobs in the nation. She has voted to keep the Minutemen Project secretive for immigrants and voted no on extending immigrant residency rules.
LGBT rights.
McKinney supports gay adoption, voting no on a District of Columbia bill that would ban them in 1999, and received an 80% rating by the Human Rights Campaign for a pro-gay rights stance. 
Gun control.
McKinney supports strict gun control on all people who may be a danger to society, which may even include police officers and government officials. In 1999 she voted no on a bill that would decrease gun waiting period and in 2005 voted no on a bill that would exempt gun companies from accidental death lawsuits as well as prevent the manufacturing of armor-piercing shots and shells.

The Road to the Isles

"The Road to the Isles" is a famous Scottish traditional song. It is part of the Kennedy-Fraser collection and it appeared in a book entitled 'Songs of the Hebrides' published in 1917, with the eponymous title by the Celtic poet Kenneth Macleod. The poem is headed by the statement 'Written for the lads in France during the Great War'. The impression is given by the notes appended to the book that the author was Kenneth Macleod himself. Marjory Kennedy-Fraser toured the Western Isles of Scotland in the summer of 1917 and collected a group of local tunes. The tune associated with the Road to the Isles was an air played by Malcolm Johnson of Barra on a chanter and composed by Pipe Major John McLellan of Dunoon (originally titled "The Bens of Jura"). Kenneth Macleod then wrote the words for a voice and harp (or piano) arrangement of this air by Patuffa Kennedy-Fraser.
It is said to have been played by Bill Millin, piper to Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat, during the first day of the Normandy Landings on D-Day during World War II, during a daring Commando attack during Operation Roast in the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy, and also at the start of construction on Toronto's first subway line, under Yonge Street, in 1949.
The lyrics mention first the hills of the Isle of Skye (whose memory is calling the traveller west); then the successive locations he will pass on the way across the Western Highlands and Inner and Outer Hebrides. The locations mentioned are (in this order): the Cuillin Hills (on the Isle of Skye), Tummel (in Perthshire), Loch Rannoch (in Perth and Kinross), Lochaber (to the west of the Scottish Highlands), Shiel (near Fort William), Ailort (near the Sound of Arisaig), Morar (near Loch Morar), the Skerries (rocky islets - in this case, just off Skye), and the Lews (near Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis).
A cromach or cromack is a shepherd's crook or stick.
Lyrics.
"A far croonin' is pullin' me away"<BR>
"As take I wi' my cromack to the road."<BR>
"The far Coolins are puttin' love on me"<BR>
"As step I wi' the sunlight for my load."
Chorus<BR>
"Sure by Tummel and Loch Rannoch and Lochaber I will go"<BR>

Dishevelled (Dsh) is a family of proteins involved in canonical and non-canonical Wnt signalling pathways. Dsh is a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that acts directly downstream of frizzled receptors. It takes its name from its initial discovery in flies, where a mutation in the dishevelled gene was observed to cause improper orientation of body and wing hairs.
Dishevelled plays important roles in both the embryo and the adult, ranging from cellular differentiation and cell polarity to social behavior.

Universidad de Chile.
In January 2010, Club Universidad de Chile signed the winger from Cobreloa for around $700.000. His high caliber performances in the Chilean Championship and the 2011 Copa Sudamericana have piqued the interest of several prominent European clubs, including Internazionale with manager Claudio Ranieri recently alluding to a January move for the forward.
In November 2011, he was chosen as a candidate for South American Footballer of the Year (finally, was only defeated by Neymar, and got the second position), and in December he was chosen Chilean Footballer of the Year 2011.

Eretz Yisrael Clock

An Eretz Yisrael Clock (also Eretz HaKodesh Clock) is a clock which is reset to 12:00 at sundown everyday. It was used by the Old Yishuv and is still used by certain groups in the Meah Shearim, and Geulah neighborhoods of Jerusalem; as well as in Ramat Beit Shemesh and Safed.
The system of time keeping is based on that used in the Ottoman Empire at the time the Old Yishuv arrived from Europe at the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century.

Royal Victoria Railway

The Royal Victoria Railway runs for around through Royal Victoria Country Park in Netley, Hampshire, England, with views of Southampton Water. The line is built to the popular gauge of and runs every weekend throughout the year and all school holidays.
The Line.
The ride normally starts at Picadilly, named after the park road junction just opposite. Tickets are bought from the engine shed, opposite a well laid out yard, which is in fact the area for a new station building. The carriage shed is also here. Upon leaving the station, which is set into the hillside the line curves, crosses a set of points, that lead up to the yard and hence the engine shed, and runs along a straight parallel with Southampton water. The view from here is obscured by gorse hedges. At the end of the straight is another point, put in place for the new extension being built. The Train will always curve left here and run inland. On the right can be seen the area for specials, such as teddy bears picnic and treasure hunt and on the left, a new double track section. Here, the train passes over the site of a yet to be built diamond crossing where one track will cross over and then over a point which allows the other track to join the mainline. This double track leads back to the yard and the site of a new terminus station through the carriage shed. The line curves right at this point and begins to descend entering a closely wooded section. At the bottom of the hill is where the train stops for the specials. The line enters a cutting, and curves around an 'S' bend, emerging onto an embankment with panoramic views of Southampton Water and the Chapel, last remnant of the once huge military hospital. At the bottom of this embankment is a short section of hedge, which gives way to Chapel Road Station. This is the start for all special events and some other trains but is normally closed. There is now a new ticket office in place at the end of the platform replacing the old one which was very tired. Upon leaving the level chapel road station, the line begins to climb crossing the first level crossing and running between the gorse bank and the car park on an embankment. There is a 'S' bend through a patch of small trees before the line emerges to run below the playground and past the tea rooms on the former hospital branch trackbed. The line curves inland again and crosses a second crossing just opposite the recently refurbished Cedar Tea Rooms. Here the line begins to climb more steeply and, if you are lucky enough to be on a steam engine you can here the engine working hard to climb the steep grade as it enters some woodland and another cutting. At the deepest point of the cutting the line, curves sharply. This is the sharpest curve on the whole line and will need realigning before the planned tunnel can be built. Curving right, out of the sharp bend and through another 'S', the line runs straight, climbing alongside the sensory garden and emerges from the woods across another level crossing and left past the playground. The view here is easily the best on the line but, does not last long before the line re-enters the gorse bank. Across the last level crossing, down a short straight brings us to Picadilly and the end of our journey.
Extension.
There is planned a new terminus station, opposite the engine shed. This will then lead into the carriage shed, which doubles up as a tunnel. At the other side of it, the line splits into two tracks, and heads south in a shallow cutting. At the end, the left hand line joins the main circuit, but the right hand one stops short of the current mainline. Here it is planned to build a diamond crossing, and a new curve through the specials area, to join up with a straight that is already in place and leads to a point. Trains will eventually leave by the left track, travel around the main circuit and then continue straight on at the points to the new loop, over the diamond crossing and return through the carriage shed to the new station terminus.
Staff.
The line is run by a group of dedicated volunteers who carry out and perform all the work necessary to improve and maintain the railway. On most Sundays can be seen a gang of young volunteers from network rail who help out with various tasks such as hedge cutting. There are also one or two permanent young volunteers who assist with driving and other things when needed. In 2005, the tri-service cadets from Southampton university began construction of the new station building, but complications led to them instead assisting with the track laying on the extension, and the postponing of the building work.
Projects.
There are various other projects including a new steam engine, large terminus station and extensive refurbishment of Chapel Road station, including the reinstatement of the passing loop and general clean, some of which including a new ticket office and much of the fence repainting from black to cream has already been done.

Deezer

Deezer is a web-based music streaming service. It allows users to listen to music on various devices online or offline. Created in Paris, France, Deezer currently has 30 million licensed tracks in its library, over 30,000 radio channels, 12 million monthly active users, and 5 million paid subscribers. 
Availability.
As of September 2013 the service is available in 182 countries. A list of countries can be found on Deezer's developer website.
History.
In 2006, Daniel Marhely developed the first version of Deezer, called Blogmusik, in Paris. Its idea was to give unlimited access to music lovers through streaming technology. The site in its original incarnation was charged with copyright infringement by French agency SACEM, and after being shut down in April 2007 was relaunched as Deezer in August, having reached an agreement with SACEM to pay copyright holders with revenue from advertising on the site and by giving users the ability to download songs streamed on Deezer from iTunes, with Deezer receiving a commission from each purchase.
At the time of its launch in 2007, Deezer had not yet negotiated agreements with major music labels, and therefore offered a limited catalogue. It took more than two years for agreements to be signed with the four largest labels, as well as various smaller ones, but by 2011 the company had rights to about eight million songs. During August 2007, its first month of operations, Deezer saw about 773,000 visitors to its site, with traffic increasing rapidly in the next several years—2.75 million people used the service in May 2008 and there were seven million users by December 2009.
Despite high traffic, Deezer almost immediately ran into financial problems—during the first half of 2008, the company saw revenue of just 875,000 euros, not enough to pay its licensing fees. In July 2008, the company began running ads itself through advertising agency Deezer Media; in October, Deezer secured $8.4 million in funding from AGF Private Equity and CM-CIC Capital Prive, bringing total investment in the company to $15.8 million. The company introduced mandatory registration in February 2009 to gather more precise data on users, in order to run more targeted ads, and in November 2009 began running audio ads between songs.
On 5 November 2009, Deezer launched a new three-tier service model. While continuing basic free web streaming, the company also introduced two subscription services—users paying €4.99 monthly received higher-quality music without ads, and users paying €9.99 monthly gained access to downloadable applications for computers, as well as iOS, Android, and BlackBerry mobile devices.
In January 2010, the company's CEO and one of its co-founders, Jonathan Benassaya, was replaced as CEO by Axel Dauchez, after fewer than 15,000 of Deezer's 12 million users signed up for its subscription services. In August 2010, mobile operator Orange partnered with Deezer in a deal to include free access to Deezer Premium, the highest tier of Deezer's streaming packages, with some of Orange's telecommunications contracts in France. Almost immediately after the partnership began, the rate of users signing up for Deezer's premium services went from 6,000 a month to 100,000; by January 2011, 500,000 people were subscribing to the service, with the million-subscriber mark reached in the middle of 2011, half a year ahead of schedule. The two companies expanded their partnership in September 2011 to include Orange contract customers in the United Kingdom. Also in September, Deezer added Facebook integration to its service, allowing users to send music to one another via Facebook.
On 7 December 2011, Deezer, at the time available only in Belgium, France and the United Kingdom, announced plans to expand worldwide during the rest of 2011 and continuing into 2012. According to the company, it planned to make its services available to the whole of Europe by the end of the year, to the Americas (excluding the United States) by the end of January 2012, to Africa and Southeast Asia by the end of February and the rest of the world (excluding Japan) by the end of June.
In the event, it took until 15 March 2012 for service to be available across the whole of Europe, while service launched in Canada, Australia and New Zealand on 25 April. On 8 June, Deezer announced availability in 35 Latin American countries, though not in Brazil, Cuba or Venezuela. On 15 August, Deezer announced it would be available in Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines within several weeks.
On 8 October 2012, Deezer announced that it had received $130 million in funding from Access Industries, to be used for further international expansion. Two days later, the company announced that it had expanded into 76 new markets, bringing its worldwide total to 160 countries. On 21 December, Deezer announced a new service level offering two hours of free, ad-supported music streaming a month, available to users worldwide, the company's first free music streaming service outside of France. CEO Axel Dauchez said that Deezer was also looking for a partner to work with to introduce service in the United States. Dauchez said that the company wanted a partner "able to provide us with a significant volume of subscribers" to help offset what he called the "unbelievably high" costs of entering the US market.
As of December 2012, Deezer has about three million users paying for subscriptions, out of a monthly active user base of about seven million, with 20 million songs in its library. By 2016, according to CEO Axel Dauchez, the company aims to have five percent of the global music market.
In January 2013, Deezer announced its expansion into 22 new countries across the Middle East, Africa, Asia, United States, and Brazil, bringing its total to 182. 
Following this expansion, Deezer announced partnerships with LG, Samsung, and Toshiba that will see Deezer apps made available on smart TV platforms, along with a new brand identity developed in association with the illustrator mcbess.
Since then, Deezer has made a number of announcements, including its Developer Reward Scheme, mobile App Studio and API upgrades, a new, exclusive beta version of its mobile app for Android users, and the new Deezer app for Windows 8. 
April 2013 also saw Deezer update its iOS app with a new smart caching feature, allowing the app to identify and remember people’s most played tracks, even in areas of poor network coverage.
Accounts and subscriptions.
As of September 2013 there are three Deezer account types.

Portuguese conquest of the Banda Oriental

The Portuguese conquest of the Banda Oriental was the armed-conflict that took place between 1816 and 1820 in the Banda Oriental, for control of what today comprises the whole of the Republic of Uruguay, the northern part of the Argentine Mesopotamia and southern Brazil. The four-year armed-conflict resulted in the annexation of the Banda Oriental into the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves as the Province of Cisplatina.
The belligerents were, on one side, the ""artiguistas"" led by José Gervasio Artigas and some leaders of other provinces that made up the Federal League, like Andrés Guazurary, and on the other, the troops of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarve, directed by Carlos Federico Lecor.
On the naval front, the conflict far exceeded the Rio de la Plata and the Argentine coast to spread globally, as the Insurgent Privateers, most notably under the flag of Buenos Aires and flag of Artigas, harassed Portuguese and Spanish ships in Europe, Africa and the Caribbean.
Causes.
The causes led King João VI of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, whose court had been installed in Rio de Janeiro since 1808, to embark on the invasion of the Banda Oriental can be divided into general and circumstantial.
Among the first is located in the main place, the former Portuguese aspiration to bring the frontiers of Brazil to the coast of Rio de la Plata, arguing that it matched the Tordesillas line by which Spain and Portugal had divided the world in 1494. For that reason, the region of the Rio de la Plata was a border area between Spain and Portugal, and as such, a highly conflictive area and theater of bloody battles over the centuries, even after the American colonies became independent of the European powers.
The Río de la Plata was strategic because it is the starting point of a large river basin, the fifth in the world, that goes to the heart of South America, from near mining areas in Potosi (current Bolivia), through Paraguay, Mato Grosso and reaching São Paulo. Additionally, the Banda Oriental, in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, was an area of major agricultural wealth, which was organized on the old dairy and beef production, a staple of African slaves who constituted the Brazilian economic base
Following that line of historical conflict, Buenos Aires was founded in 1536 to prevent the Portuguese from extending beyond the Río de la Plata. During the period in which the kingdom of Portugal was made in the "Catholic Monarchy", between 1580 and 1640, Spain relaxed precautions on the ill-defined borders between the two kingdoms, a circumstance that Portugal took to expand the territory of Brazil, to the west and south.
In 1680 the Kingdom of Portugal founded the Colonia del Sacramento, the first settlement in what is now Uruguay, right in front of Buenos Aires, on the other bank of the Rio de la Plata. Since then several clashes occur and precarious agreements between the Portuguese and Spanish in the Banda Oriental and the Misiones.
Portugal also took the troubled political circumstances produced from Napoleon's invasion of Spain in 1808, introducing the Princess Carlota Joaquina, wife of John VI and sister of King Ferdinand VII, captive of Napoleon, as the best alternative to protect the interests of Spanish crown. However, the common struggle against Napoleon Bonaparte, who invaded Spain in order to attack Portugal, as their government they disregarded the continental blockade imposed by him to Britain, led Portugal to avoid a disagreement with Spain and the occupation projects were delayed.
The occupation of the Misiones Orientales in 1801 by Portuguese troops, commanded by bandeirante José Francisco Borges do Canto and attempts to generate a protectorate during the crisis of 1808, were closer antecedents. The crisis began when the governor of Montevideo Francisco Javier de Elio came into conflict with the Viceroy of the Río de la Plata, Santiago de Liniers, who came to the political break with the constitution of the Junta of Montevideo on 21 September that year. The Portuguese monarchy took advantage of the situation by sending the military and diplomatic Joaquín Javier Curado to offer, in terms restraining orders, acceptance of the protectorate in the Banda Oriental on the argument the preserve it from a Viceroy considered "Afrancesado". Elio rejected the offer at first, but the course of political events from the 1810 May Revolution in Buenos Aires allowed the Portuguese, on two occasions, to attempt armed seizure of the territory. Those times were 1811 and 1816.
The Portuguese invasion of 1811, was the result of a request by then viceroy of Río de la Plata, Francisco Javier de Elio, in support of the Spanish authorities against artiguist revolutionaries. This invasion took place in the context, as already mentioned, of the May Revolution, where the influence of the same Elío established the capital of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in Montevideo, thereby becoming viceroy. The revolution had infiltrated in the Banda Oriental after the Cry of Asencio. José Rondeau and José Artigas commanded the troops that, after the Battle of Las Piedras, besieged Montevideo on May 21, 1811. Elio, despite being besieged and in considerable difficulty, managed to block with a royalist naval fleet the port of Buenos Aires and called for help from the Portuguese. A month later, in July, was dispatched from Rio de Janeiro to the south an army of 4,000 men under General Diego de Souza. Defeated in Paraguay and Upper Peru, and stopped by the Elio naval blockade, the government of Buenos Aires sought an agreement with Montevideo in exchange for removing the naval blockade and the withdrawal of the Portuguese. The artiguists rejected the deal, which left them helpless against the enemy, and followed Artigas in the episode known as the Oriental Exodus. The Portuguese troops had not left the eastern territory until August 1812 when, with the support of the British government, Buenos Aires ensured compliance of the 1811 Armistice Agreement 1811 through the Rademaker-Herrera deal of 1812.
The context of 1816, with the state of war between the Orientals and Buenos Aires (which virtually ensured the neutrality, at least, the neutrality of Buenos Aires to the occupation of the Oriental territory) and the European context, marked by the absolutist restauration that denied the colonies their right to independence from the monarchies (which guaranteed Portugal against any hostile reaction from Spain ), proved ideal for the realization of the old goal. Those were the main circumstances.
The ailing Portuguese royal family that had emigrated to Rio de Janeiro in 1808 fleeing from Napoleon's invasion had nothing to do with the proud Court that concerned Britain in 1816 for its expansionist aspirations. Much water had flowed under the bridges and other winds blowing in Europe and America. The endless possibilities of large and rich country of Brazil, economic development produced by the opening of Brazilian ports to international trade-decision of 1808 - and remoteness from European conflicts resulted in a bold idea of the Portuguese political leadership. Convert Brazil to the center of decision and permanent seat of the kingdom and its authorities. The presence of the Portuguese government in America has substantially changed the geopolitical vision of its leaders. This idea was seriously considered by the king, particularly after the death of his mother, Queen Maria, which occurred in March 1816, who was mentally inhibited from long ago. The Prince Regent finally ascended the throne under the name of John VI. The flamboyant monarch gave his decidedly biased American policy. Brazil seemed to assure the Braganza a first order global destination, which the little Portugal would no longer offer.
A decree almost immediately transformed the Kingdom of Portugal in the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarve, Brazil was no longer a colony and passed to form the Kingdom of Brazil, essential part of the state. From that moment the expansionist policy was accentuated and the idea of an Empire of Brazil was encouraged and supported. Such a policy did not coincide with the plans of Britain, which was opposed by the British minister Lord Strangford, who previously had a strong influence on the Brazilian government. The dispute culminated when the king himself called to London, in April 1815, to replace the diplomat, which was accepted almost immediately. These circumstances did not alter the old dependency of Portugal, and then of Imperial Brazil, regarding the economic policy of the British Empire. But the relative emancipation of John VI regarding the British power had hitherto closely monitored allowed Portuguese politics execute his old plan to invade and annex the Banda Oriental. Particular interest in the project, had the planters of Rio Grande do Sul, which on the one hand, aspired to control the overseas port of Montevideo as a way to channel their business (the strong regional and even separatist tendencies in the region had the highest interest in having its own exit that would link to international trade), and on the other hand, were concerned about the implementation of rural artiguista regulation, adopted in September 1815, which established the right of confiscation of the lands of the enemies of the revolution with its disrespect for property rights and the phenomenon of rural populace dividing the land, under the banner "The most unhappy are the most privileged". In addition, under the chaos prevailing in the United Provinces, which declared independence after the Congress of Tucumán, and the "radicalism" of Artigas, he regarded the Banda Oriental as a dangerous center spread of "anarchy" to impulses of the "Montoneros" federalist and republican. No wonder then that the Marquis of Alegrete riograndense warlord, has made maximum efforts for the project, and that those who were later prominent leaders of separatism riograndense, Bento Gonçalves da Silva and Bentos Manuel Ribeiro, have played with it a leading role.
Also, Spanish and American emigrants who sought refuge in Brazil persuaded the Portuguese and Brazilian King John VI, to initiate a military campaign on the Banda Oriental. Gaspar de Vigodet, last Spanish colonial governor of Montevideo and the Spanish friar Cirilo Alameda promoted the adventure with the hope that, once obtained the victory, Portugal would return those territories to Spanish rule. The locals unit exiled by the Fontezuelas Mutiny led by Carlos de Alvear, expected a defeat of Artigas, leader of federalism, and supplyed the Portuguese-Brazilian Court with any information, to support their plans. Anti-artiguists orientals (Mateo Magariños, José Batlle and Carreó) also made an important effort in this regard. Particular importance was Nicolas Herrera, former secretary of the government of Alvear deposed in 1815. Herrera arrived in Rio de Janeiro in exile, disgraced and bankrupt, but his undeniable charm and talent enabled him to persuade Antonio de Araujo y Acevedo, Count da Barca, one of the chief advisers of John VI. Soon those responsible for Portuguese-Brazilian politics appreciated the knowledge of the lawyer in respect to geography and political reality of the province to annex.
Complicity of Buenos Aires.
The main drawback of the campaign of conquest lay in the possibility that the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata react in defense of a territory which formed part of the country since its inception. Certainly it was not convenient to Portugal that the annexation of the Banda Oriental resulted in a difficult war, against all the provinces of La Plata. According to Uruguayan historians Washington Reyes Abadie, Oscar H. Bruschera and Tabaré Melogno, and the Argentine Raúl Scalabrini Ortiz, the information about Buenos Aires neutrality was first given by Manuel Jose Garcia, sent to negotiate with Britain and the court in Rio de Janeiro that they do not support the Spanish Empire, at a time when it was trying to recover the independent colonies.
According to the Uruguayan writer Lincoln Maiztegui Casas, "Garcia with his ideal and interventional unit used all his influence to persuade the Portuguese King that the government of Buenos Aires would not take military action to keep the Oriental territory." Regarding the role of Juan Martin de Pueyrredón, who took office in 1816 as Supreme Director of the United Provinces replacing Alvear, Maiztegui Casas asserts that although he differed from the radical Unitarianism of those who had commissioned Garcia, he though that the unitarian party was not strong enough to subdue the federal movement, which quickly spread over the provinces; Pueyrredón, same as the previous rulers, was sympathetic to a defeat of Artigas, still considering him an expression of barbarism. Pueyrredón's attitude was ambiguous against the Portuguese invasion, accounting for one side that it implied in Buenos Aires the struggle against federalism and artiguismo in particular, but on the other hand also to a public in Buenos Aires that massively opposed to segregation of the territory and the British interests seeking the creation of a small independent state. Ultimately, Pueyrredón as supreme director, collaborated with the invasion, not only because he did not declare war on the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarve to the occupation of part of the country he governed, but because he steadily attacked the provinces of the Federal League, which were inhibited to cooperate with the defense of the territory organized by Artigas. But it also happened after of facts that can not be omitted, including the intransigence of the Protector, Artigas who systematically and firmly refused to recognize the authority of the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of Rio de la Plata, which led him to the conviction that Artigas was intratable. Pueyrredón, expressing a political line that held differences with predominantly Unity Party in Buenos Aires since 1812, and was taken with considerable concern the Portuguese invasion of the Banda Oriental, with no objective reasons to ensure that such attitude was apparent. First, Nicolas de Vedia sent to interview Lecor, leading a trade to ensure that the invasion did not continue to Entre Rios, but that he had instructions to "keep on Buenos Aires strict neutrality". The commissioner returned to Buenos Aires a letter of assurance that would not pass the Portuguese adventure in the Oriental Province, obtained in conversation with Nicolas Herrera. Then Pueyrredón sent some weapons and war supplies to Artigas (low volume, but as a testimony of good will; 300 frames and 100 pounds of gunpowder), issued a loan of 200,000 pesos for military spending and war, a committee responsible for organizing the potential conflict.
Military planification.
Portuguese army.
The Portuguese army had between 10,000 to 12,000 men, fully armed and disciplined, veterans of the Napoleonic Wars. An effective intelligence service, which allowed them to determine accurately the main steps of Artigas, and watchful care of every detail, with 30 doctors in the health service. The first transports arrived in Rio de Janeiro, at the end of March next year. The rest of the division made it to the end of March 1816. The division was commanded by General Carlos Federico Lecor. The May 13, 1816, birthday of the new king, John VI observed with praise and wonder his new invasion troops.
The plan of operations behaved offensively, invading the Banda Oriental and the area of Argentine Mesopotamia. The "Instructions of His Majesty King John VI" to General Lecor, signed by the Marquis de Aguilar, the June 4, 1816 are particularly illustrative for understanding the motives and purposes of the Portuguese action in the Platine territories. With respect to Artigas, he prevented Lecor that although the Portuguese force had strength to beat him, it was advisable to negotiate with him if possible, under the conditions that his military body was dissolved, that he would move to reside in Rio de Janeiro or another place that his Majesty allowed, that he would deliver his weapons, that he would receive a salary similar to the Portuguese infantry colonels and that he would be allowed to sell his possessions and goods. As for his officers and troops, they could be admitted in the Portuguese army, under his discretion. 
Finally, it was recommended to keep scrit neutrality with the government of Buenos Aires, and in the case of being asked he would deny any intention of moving to the other side of the Rio de la Plata. The day after these Instructions were issued - on June 5, 1816 - John VI appointed Lecor Governor and Captain General of Montevideo.
Brazilian divisions.
The preparation of the Lusitanian invasion had already begun in mid-1815. As the Prince Regent had informed the Court of Madrid, the Royal Volunteer Division was taken to Brazil, which represented the elite corps of the invasion, commanded by Lecor. The British William Carr Beresford acted as advisor, and made Marshal. The division was composed of two brigades, commanded by Brigadiers Jorge de Avillez Zuzarte and Francisco Homen de Magalhães Pizarro, consisting each of two battalions of hunters, eight companies, three squadrons of cavalry and artillery park, a total of 4,831 pieces. This division of Royal Volunteers had 6,000 men in total. Lecor decided to modify the order of operations, despite the detailed instructions, fearing the climate. In Santa Catarina he traded his land troops to Porto Alegre, arranging a new plan with Captain General of Rio Grande, Marquis of Alegrete. According to it, Lecor himself at the head of the Royal Volunteers, march along the route of the Atlantic coast, in the direction of Maldonado and Montevideo. The Royal Volunteer Division was also called South Column or Lecor Division, and had to be protected and flanked by naval squadron commanded by Count of Viana.
After the Division of General Bernardo Silveira invaded Cerro Largo, taking aim to Paysandú and with the mission to protect the right flank of Lecor with their 2,000 men of the Royal Volunteer Cavalry and 800 riograndense militias. Lieutenant Colonel Abreu, with 650 men would come to reinforce the colonel Chagas in the Eastern Missions, aiming to advance on the Eastern Missions and the Province of Misiones. Meanwhile Jardim ensure greater communication between these two chiefs and would monitor the native minuanes and charrúas in Santa Ana and Haedo. Finally, a large reserve, commanded by Lieutenant General Javier Joaquin Curado stayed at the Ibirapuiá Chico, able to come to the support of any of the other contingents. It consisted of 2,000 men and 11 pieces of artillery.
Plan of Artigas.
Artigas learned in the first half of January 1816 the Lusitanian intentions. He suspected this for several letters he had intercepted. On January 11 he gave instructions to Andres Guazurary, to prevent the entry of Portugueses into the territory. He also left instructions to withdraw from Candelaria, sending an observation force to Paraguay, to settle in Santo Tomé and watch the movements of Paraguay and Portugal. From there they would be near La Cruz, Yapeyú and other places in danger of being invaded. Similar instructions were sent to the other authorities two days later. 
Artigas took many provisions for the upcoming conflict, whose pace was intensified in the following months. Cavalry corps were organized and distributed in the strategic steps guards, and the requised weapons and ammunition gunpowder was sent to Purificación. 
Artigas had a counter-offensive plan: go up the Uruguay River and invade the populations near the Ibicuy River, taking the war to Brazil, and cutting the armies from reinforcements. He created as well the military units of "cívicos" and "libertos"
Consequences.
At the end of the Portuguese invasion, over 4000 Uruguayans, or 6% of the entire population of the Banda Oriental, had been killed by the invaders in three and a half years of bloody war.
The Banda Oriental, now called the Cisplatina Province, became first part of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves and in 1822 of the Empire of Brazil after its independence from Portugal.
In 1828, after the Cisplatine War, Uruguay became an independent state.

Virginia Museum of Natural History

The Virginia Museum of Natural History is the state's natural history museum located in Martinsville, Virginia founded in 1984. The museum has several different award winning publications, is affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution, and has more than 22 million items. This includes the first-ever intact stromatolite head found in Virginia, which is one of the largest complete 'heads' in the world, at over 5 feet in diameter and weighing over 2 tons.
History.
The Virginia Museum of Natural History was founded in 1984 as the The Boaz Foundation, named after Dr. Noel T. Boaz, Founding Director. The museum was founded as a private institution, but on June 2, 1985, the museum opened to the public with the new and current name. Three years later in 1988, local and statewide leaders such as Speaker of the Virginia General Assembly, A. L. Philpott, helped the museum become an agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia . The first meeting of the Board of Trustees was also held in the same year. In 1994, the Museum was accredited by the American Alliance of Museums . On March 31, 2007, the new museum facility was opened at its current location. In 2010, the museum was re-accredited by the American Alliance of Museums, a high honor as fewer than 5% of the museums in America receive re-accreditation.
Exhibits.
The VMNH features award-winning permanent and temporary exhibits. VMNH exhibits and iteams are also featured throughout the state of Virginia in different museums, state parks, and buildings.

Vinga Lighthouse

Vinga Lighthouse "(Vinga fyr)", is a Swedish lighthouse on Vinga island built in 1890. But Vinga has been an important island for sea travelers for a long time. The lighthouse in use now is the third one on the island. It is one of Sweden's most famous lighthouses and a special symbol for the city of Gothenburg.
The first tower was built in 1841, it was the first Swedish lighthouse with lens. A second was built in 1854 to make the island a "double lighthouse". There had been some complaints that it was hard to figure out if it was the lighthouse in Skagen (Denmark) or Vinga that you saw on a long distance. The flame ran on colza oil. In the 1880s the need for a better and higher lighthouse was urgent and in 1890 the new lighthouse was built, it ran on paraffin. The oldest lighthouse was transformed to a watch tower (the red and gray short tower on the picture). The second lighthouse was eliminated.
In 1948 the tower was electrified and in 1974 it was automated. It is now remote controlled by the Swedish Maritime Administration, who wanted to deactivate the lighthouse in 2007 because the commercial shipping does not need it anymore, but it was met with heavy protesting. For now, the tower is still active.
On the island is also a distinctive red pyramid day beacon side by side with the tower. It was built in 1857.
Today Vinga lighthouse is a popular tourist attraction, and during the summer season there is often guided tours on the island. The Swedish poet and musician Evert Taube lived as a child on Vinga where his father worked.

Arthur Gaskin

Arthur Joseph Gaskin RBSA (March 16, 1862 – June 4, 1928) was an English illustrator, painter, teacher and designer of jewellery and enamelwork.
Gaskin and his wife Georgie Gaskin were members of the Birmingham Group of Artist-Craftsmen, which sought to apply the principles of the Arts and Crafts movement across the decorative arts. Like many of the group, Gaskin studied at the Birmingham School of Art under Edward R. Taylor and later taught there.
Life.
Gaskin was born in the Lee Bank area of Birmingham in 1862, the son of a decorator. He was brought up in Wolverhampton where he attended Wolverhampton Grammar School before returning to Birmingham in 1879.
In 1883 Gaskin entered the Birmingham School of Art, being appointed to the teaching staff two years later despite not completing his course. It was here that he met Georgie Gaskin in 1888, one of his students, whom he married in 1894. Gaskin worked as a decorative artist from 1890, producing woodcut illustrations for William Morris's Kelmscott Press, and painted in tempera after receiving instruction from his friend Joseph Southall at Southall's studio in Edgbaston.
The Gaskins started producing jewellery from 1899, and in 1903 Arthur was appointed headmaster of the Vittoria Street School for Jewellers and Silversmiths, where he was to remain until 1924, when the couple retired to Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire.
As a Member of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (RBSA), Gaskin was instrumental in organising the exhibition 'The New Movement in Art' at the Society in 1917. This was a revised version of Roger Fry's Post-Impressionist exhibition held in 1910.

__NOTOC__
The Kraft K-1 Super Fli is a single-seat sport aircraft that was designed in the United States in the early 1970s and marketed for homebuilding. It is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional design with fixed, tailwheel undercarriage. The wings have a wooden structure, skinned in plywood, while the fuselage and empennage are built from steel tube, the fuselage skinned in aluminium and the tail in fabric. It has a very similar design to radio controlled craft.
The Super Fli's designer, Phil Kraft, was a champion builder and flier of radio-controlled model aircraft who in 1972 decided to apply this expertise to the design of a full-size aircraft. The design was therefore based around the guidelines normally applied to model aircraft, particularly in its wing design, areas, and moments.

<doc id="19222406" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19222406" title="HIV/AIDS in Bolivia">
HIV/AIDS in Bolivia

HIV/AIDS in Bolivia has a less than 1 percent prevalence of Bolivia's adult population estimated to be HIV-positive and therefore the country has one of the lowest HIV prevalence rates in the Latin America and Caribbean region.
Prevalence.
Bolivia’s first case of HIV was diagnosed in 1985, and since then the epidemic has been largely concentrated in groups of men who have sex with men (MSM). In May 2007, the Government of Bolivia reported a total of 2,464 cases of HIV since the beginning of the epidemic. UNAIDS, which included estimates of unknown cases, reported in 2005 that 7,000 people in Bolivia were HIV-infected, but estimates vary widely between 3,800 and 17,000 people.
HIV prevalence rates in Bolivia are highest among MSM, who had infection levels of 15 percent in La Paz and nearly 24 percent in Santa Cruz, according to a 2005 report cited by UNAIDS. Homeless boys and girls also appear to be vulnerable to HIV infection. A recent study of street youth in Cochabamba found that 3.5 percent were HIV-positive. In part because of governmental regulation that requires sex workers to regularly visit sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics for checkups, HIV rates among sex workers have remained low; however, patterns from other countries in the region suggest that Bolivian sex workers may be another population at risk for HIV/AIDS.
Several factors put Bolivia in danger of a wider HIV/AIDS epidemic, including high levels of migration from rural to urban areas and social norms that encourage men to have multiple sexual partners. According to the 2003 Bolivia Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), 23 percent of single men aged 15 to 49 had multiple sex partners in the preceding 12 months, which puts them and their sex partners at risk for HIV/AIDS. There is a lack of basic knowledge and information about the disease, with 24 percent of women aged 15 to 49 reporting that they have never heard of the disease. High rates of violence, including sexual abuse, contribute to the spread of the disease. Many false beliefs persist, with 45 percent of those surveyed in the DHS maintaining that a person who looks healthy cannot have HIV. Compounding these issues are stigma and discrimination against HIV-infected individuals and at-risk groups and limited resources at the public and private levels.
National response.
The Government of Bolivia has made a political commitment to confront the HIV/AIDS epidemic. However, its allocation of resources to its national STI/HIV/AIDS program has been uneven, and sustainability is not guaranteed. The low levels of HIV funding are due to the limitations of Bolivia’s health system, which reaches only about 70 percent of the population, and the more immediate threats of other infectious diseases – tuberculosis, malaria, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, dengue fever, and yellow fever – that demand the majority of Bolivia’s health funds. Nonetheless, the government consistently signals its dedication to confronting the epidemic. The most recent example is the joint signing in February 2007 of an agreement to implement the Adoption of Attitudes and Practices to Prevent HIV-AIDS at the Interior of the Armed Forces project by the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Health and Sports, the Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces, and UNAIDS.
Bolivia has been able to mobilize support from the international community, and a large proportion of its funding comes from external sources. For instance, the UN Theme Group and the UNAIDS Country Coordinator support projects targeting vulnerable populations. However, coverage of HIV services to vulnerable groups is low, reaching only 3 percent of MSM and 30 percent of sex workers. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria targets HIV-infected and -affected individuals in nine provinces for integral care, including antiretroviral treatment (ART); laboratory and psychological support; and treatment of opportunistic illnesses. Currently, however, ART reaches only 24 percent of the target population of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).
Bolivia is a partner in the Brazil+7 initiative, a UNICEF-, UNAIDS-, and Brazilian-led effort dedicated to expanding HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care for pregnant women and young people; to offering universal access to ART for PLWHA; and to ensuring universal access to services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). The other partner countries are São Tomé and Príncipe, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, and East Timor.

<doc id="19222422" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19222422" title="Cadmus-class sloop">
Cadmus-class sloop

The "Cadmus" class was a six-ship class of 10-gun screw steel sloops built for the Royal Navy between 1900 and 1903. This was the very last class of the Victorian Navy's multitude of sloops, gunvessels and gunboats to be constructed, and they followed the traditional pattern for 'colonial' small warships, with a full rig of sails. After them, the "Fisher Reforms" of the Navy ended the construction and deployment of this type of vessel. Most of the class survived until the 1920s, remaining on colonial stations during World War I.
Design.
The "Cadmus" class was constructed of copper-sheathed steel to a design by William White, the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction. Propulsion was provided by a three-cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engine developing and driving twin screws. They were an evolution of the "Condor"-class sloop, carrying more coal, which in turn gave a greater length and displacement. This class comprised the very last screw sloops built for the Royal Navy, and "Espiegle" was the last Royal Navy ship built with a figurehead.
Sail plan.
As designed and built the class was fitted with a barquentine-rigged sail plan. After was lost in a gale in 1901, the Admiralty abandoned sails entirely. "Espiegle" was never fitted with sails, and the rest of the class had their yards removed in 1914. The official attitude to sails and the loss of yards did not completely prevent the use of sails, and log entries show that fore-and-aft sails were being used in "Odin" as late as April 1920.
Armament.
The class was armed with six 4-inch/25pdr (1ton) quick-firing breech loaders and four 3-pounder quick-firing breech loaders, as well as several machine guns. "Fantome" had her armament reduced to two QF 3-pounders for survey work.
Operational histories.
The design of the "Cadmus" class differed from the screw sloops of the 1860s only in an evolutionary sense. Although constructed of steel and armed with quick-loading guns, they retained the sails and layout of the earlier vessels. By the turn of the twentieth century, they were thoroughly obsolete. The overseas stations of the Royal Navy were responsible for patrolling the maritime British Empire, and these ships were intended for that role. The rapidity with which they were sold or converted to survey ships gives testament to their out-moded design. According to "Hansard", it was stated by the Secretary to the Admiralty in Parliament on 6 March 1905 that 
HMS "Espiegle".
On commissioning, "Espiegle" joined the China Station. Due to the threat to British subjects and interests in Yingkou (then known as Newchwang) from the Russo-Japanese war, she was sent to the Liao River during 1903-1904, where she wintered in the river in a mud dock dug out for her. Once the ice had melted, she made passage to Wei-hai-wei, passing Port Arthur at daylight on 13 April 1904, witnessing exchanges of fire between Japanese and Russian ships.
By 1914, "Espiegle" was on the East Indies Station. She took part in the operations in the Shatt-al-Arab in November 1914 with "Odin" and "Clio", reaching as far as Basra. She was sold at Bombay on 17 September 1923.
HMS "Fantome".
"Fantome" served on the North America and West Indies Station, including a period in late 1902 and early 1903 when, under Commodore Montgomerie in , she enforced a blockade of the Venezuelan coast. From 1906, "Fantome" was operated by the Royal Navy Survey Service and conducted survey operations in Australian waters until the outbreak of war in 1914. She was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy on 27 November 1914 as a patrol vessel armed with two and four 12-pounder guns. From September 1915 to September 1917, she operated in the Bay of Bengal and South China Sea, and from late 1917 was based at Suva, Fiji performing police duties. She conducted a punitive raid on Malekula in the New Hebrides in October 1918. "Fantome" was returned to the Royal Navy in April 1920 for service as a survey ship, remaining in Australian waters until she paid off in April 1924. She was sold for scrap at Sydney on 30 January 1925, hulked and used as a barge, mainly in Tasmania. She was finally sold for demolition in 1956.
HMS "Merlin".
In 1904, "Merlin" took part in the 4th expedition of the Somaliland Campaign against the Mad Mullah. The naval force included HM Ships , , , , and . From 1906, "Merlin" was employed as a survey ship, conducting hydrographic work both at home and abroad. She re-commissioned at Hong Kong on 5 November 1913, and continued to work as a survey vessel, for which her armament was reduced. She was sold at Hong Kong on 3 August 1923.
HMS "Odin".
"Odin" spent the first part of her life at the South Atlantic Station. On 23 January 1904, she called at the isolated island of Tristan da Cunha, carrying Mr William Hammond Tooke with an offer to the islanders; 
After vaccinating children, conducting a census (74 people) and baptising a child, they received the answer of the inhabitants: three families were for, seven against, and one neutral. The offer was therefore withdrawn, and the ship carried only one passenger to the Cape, a Mrs Amy Matilda Hagan. "Odin" steamed for Nightingale Island and Inaccessible Island, before returning to the Cape. By 1909, "Odin" had become a drill ship for the Cape Naval Volunteers, but by March 1914 had recommissioned at Muscat for service on the East Indies Station.
October 1914 saw "Odin", "Espiegle", and protecting the Abadan Island oil refineries at the northern end of the Persian Gulf. On 7 October, the Turkish Government delivered a formal letter to "Espiegle" protesting at the violition of Turkish waters within the Shatt-al-Arab. An uneasy peace was sustained until 31 October, when "Espiegle" learnt that the Turkish Navy had shelled Odessa, thus effectively declaring war. On 5 November, Great Britain officially declared war on the Ottoman Empire, and on 6 November, "Espiegle" engaged a series of trenches opposite Abadan Island. On 21 November, "Espiegle" and "Odin" bypassed a sunken barrage in the Shatt-al-Arab and steamed as far as Basra. A naval landing party put an end to looting in the city. "Odin" and "Espiegle" supported British and Indian Troops in engagements near Basra, firing on Turkish positions. Beyond Basra the waters of the Shatt-al-Arab are too shallow for all but the smallest vessels, and the naval contribution to the Mesopotamian campaign was taken over by an improvised fleet of tugs and paddle steamers
"Odin" continued to serve on the East Indies Station, and near Aden on 5 March 1917, she pursued the German raider "Iltis", which was scuttled rather than be captured. "Odin" was sold at Bombay on 12 November 1920 on the same day as "Clio".
HMS "Clio".
"Clio" started her career on the Australia Station, where she arrived in April 1904 after a journey with many problems. She served there for eleven months and then went on to the China Station in April 1905.
In August 1914, "Clio" re-commissioned at Hong Kong. She was initially based at Sandakan and was tasked with patrolling the Basilan Straits. In late 1914, she transferred to the Middle East and was in Port Said by the beginning of January 1915. At the end of that month she moved into the Suez Canal and was active in the defence of the canal against Turkish troops. She fired on Turkish positions on 27 January and 1–3 February, receiving incoming rifle fire on the last. She was also hit by two heavier shells, but suffered no casualties. She formed part of the British expeditionary force in the Shatt-al-Arab in April 1915, and in 1917 served in operations off Aden in March. At Dhubab on 6 May, and again at Ibn Abbas near the island of Kamaran on 8 May, landings were carried out at to punish smuggling.
In December 1919, after commissioning at Gibraltar, she took part in the fifth campaign against Mohammed Abdullah Hassan ("the Mad Mullah"). Sailors were landed, but by late February the campaign was complete. She was sold at Bombay on 12 November 1920 on the same day as "Odin".
HMS "Cadmus".
"Cadmus" was first commissioned for the Australia Station. Her maiden voyage to Australia was accomplished in record time for a sloop. In May 1905, she was ordered to follow "Clio" to the China Station. During the rest of her career, "Cadmus" served there. She recommissioned at Hong Kong on 18 October 1912, and remained on the China Station during World War I. In 1920, she was listed as "unallocated" at Hong Kong, and was sold there on 1 September 1921.

HIV/AIDS in Peru

Cases of HIV/AIDS in Peru are considered to have reached the level of a concentrated epidemic. According to a population-based survey conducted in Peru’s 24 largest cities in 2002, adult HIV prevalence was estimated to be less than 1 percent (0.6 percent among pregnant women; 0.4 percent among males; and 0.1 percent among females). The survey demonstrated that cases are unevenly distributed in the country, affecting mostly young people between the ages of 25 and 34. As of July 2010, the cumulative reported number of persons infected with HIV was 41,638, and there were 26,566 cases of AIDS, according to the Ministry of Health (MOH), and the male/female ratio for AIDS diagnoses in 2009 was 3.02 to 1. The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates 76,000 Peruvians are HIV-positive, meaning that many people at risk do not know their status. There were 3,300 deaths due to AIDS in Peru in 2007 (UNAIDS, 2008), down from 5,600 deaths in 2005.
HIV transmission is not currently a major problem outside of Peru’s large urban areas. Among Peru’s reported cases of HIV/AIDS, 77 percent are in Lima and Callao – the capital city area (United Nations General Assembly Special Session report, 2010). Sexual transmission accounts for the majority (97 percent) of cases, followed by mother-to-child transmission (2 percent), and contaminated blood and blood products (1 percent) (UNGASS, 2010). The prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM), which was 14 percent nationally and 23 percent in Lima in 2005, has continued to rise in recent years, while among sex workers prevalence remains low (0.6 to 2 percent). In five Central American countries, the annual HIV incidence was 5.1% among men who 
have sex with men, while an incidence of 3.5% has been found among men who have sex with men who attended public health clinics in Lima, Peru. A recent analysis by Alarcon-Villaverde indicated MSM account for a large proportion of HIV incidence (55 percent) in Peru (UNAIDS, 2009). In addition, transsexuals who are sex workers are the most affected population, with an estimated prevalence between 32 percent and 45 percent (UNGASS, 2010). Although 96 percent of female sex workers (FSWs) report having used a condom with their last client (MOH, 2003), the frequency of condom use among male sex workers is only 42 percent (UNGASS 2008). HIV/AIDS incidence in the main prisons in Peru is approximately 1.1 percent (Instituto Nacional Penitenciario , 2005), and condom use by prison inmates is low (32.8 percent reported in 2004) (INPE, 2005).
Blood safety is also a concern. Several reported cases of HIV infection in 2006 and 2007 have been attributed to blood transfusions received through public health services (MOH, 2007).
Infections with syphilis, gonorrhea, and Chlamydia in men and women and trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis in women are factors in the increasing risk of HIV transmission in Peru. According to the 2009 Demographic and Health Survey, 14 percent of the women surveyed among those reporting history of sexual intercourse reported having sexually transmitted infection (STI) symptoms. Inadequate and ineffective treatment of STIs is common in Peru. Inadequate and ineffective treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is common. Also of significant concern is the high HIV prevalence among prison inmates. Given the relatively low level of sexual education, limited condom use, and risky sexual behaviors practiced by some subpopulations, including multiple sex partners, there is a significant potential for the further spread of HIV in Peru. According to the 2008 UNGASS report, less than 5 percent of schools offer sex education, including information about HIV (USAID 2010). One study by Klausner and Mendoza (2002) of young people aged 18 to 30 in 34 neighborhoods in Lima, Chiclayo, and Trujillo demonstrated that 18 percent had more than one sex partner in the last year, 8 percent had more than one partner in the last three months, and condom use was low.
National response.
Peru was one of the first countries in Latin America to adopt a syndromic management approach to STIs and offer prophylaxis for preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission, although currently PMTCT coverage is only 56 percent, according to the 2010 UNGASS report. Peru’s strategy to prevent STIs was called a model for the Andean region, and in 2000, UNAIDS cited Peru’s HIV/AIDS prevention program as one of the best in the world. Soon after, however, political turmoil, an economic crisis, and repeated changes in key personnel combined to undermine MOH operations, including the STI program. In a major restructuring of the MOH in 2002 and 2003, several vertical programs, including the National AIDS Program (NAP), were merged. This was accompanied by a reduction in funding and management capacity for AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), child immunization, and other programs. All aspects of the NAP suffered. In 2004, the MOH began reconstituting its HIV/AIDS program, with the goals of limiting the expansion of the epidemic by preventing new infections and providing appropriate and effective care and support to those who have HIV/AIDS.
In 2007, a new Strategic Multisectoral Plan for the Prevention and Control of STI/HIV/AIDS for 2007–2011 was designed based on evidence-based strategies. Most-at-risk populations (MARPs) were included as one of the most important target populations. The Plan proposed nine strategic objectives, including prevention, care, and policy issues. One strategic objective was the reduction of HIV and STIs among MSM, FSW, and prison inmates. The Plan proposed the following activities: promotion and distribution of condoms, advocacy for promotion and access to services, improvement of STI/HIV services, STI/HIV facilities, treatment of STIs, strengthening the peer-educator strategy, and strengthening community-based organizations of MSM and FSW. Since the plan was designed to guide HIV/STI activities for 2007–2011, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria projects in Peru (especially the sixth round) used it as a framework for their activities.
Public health services are the main source of care for HIV/AIDS and STIs in Peru, most of which are delivered by the MOH, regional health authorities, and the social security system. In coordination with the MOH, other state sectors, such as the Ministry of Education and the Ministry for Women and Social Development, have programs directed at educating and protecting adolescents and children and preventing HIV/AIDS by promoting healthy lifestyles and reducing high-risk behaviors. Education efforts for HIV prevention in schools are being implemented as part of activities financed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
Peruvians living with HIV/AIDS are protected by Law 26626, enacted in 1996, which recognizes fundamental rights of autonomy, confidentiality, and nondiscrimination and guarantees provision of medical treatment according to the state’s capacity. HIV testing for pregnant women is mandatory where there is a risk (although this is criticized by human rights observers), and the state is required to provide integral care (including treatment) to all people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). According to the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF Towards Universal Access report, only 48 percent of HIV-infected people in need of antiretroviral therapy (ART) were receiving it in 2007.
The activities supported by the Global Fund represent a large proportion of the investment in HIV/AIDS in the country, though the Government of Peru is funding most of the costs of procuring antiretroviral drugs. Peru has obtained funding for HIV/AIDS activities through the Global Fund’s rounds two, five, and six. The initial activities emphasized the provision of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART), but later projects emphasized prevention. Peru directs more than 5% of its HIV prevention spending toward prevention programmes for men who have sex with men. An opportunity in these prevention efforts is to target HIV positive individuals through internet communication and cell phone messages to support intervention delivery for HIV treatment adherence and prevention of secondary HIV transmission.
The Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM), established for coordinating activities supported by the Global Fund, is the only multisectoral coordinating mechanism in the country. Under the CCM, governmental ministries, organizations of PLWHA and those affected by TB, nongovernmental organizations, faith-based groups, academia, and international organizations oversee and coordinate Peru’s response to the epidemic. The CCM steered the development of the Strategic Multisectoral Plan for the Prevention and Control of STI/HIV/AIDS for 2007-2011.
There are currently four national organizations of people living with HIV/AIDS in Peru. The group with the largest reported impact of 1,000 people is the Asociación Solas y Unidas, which was founded in 1999. Their principle activities include sexual and reproductive health training, gender and leadership for women living with HIV/AIDS, professional training and career support for impoverished women living with HIV/AIDS, education and training for children affected by HIV/AIDS, and nutritional support for low-income families affected by HIV/AIDS (Directory of Associations of People Living with HIV/AIDS, USAID 2004). Also working with these populations are the Alianza en Accion +, Coordinadora Peruana de Personas Viviendo con VIH/SIDA, and GAM Renacer. Overall, the populations these organizations work with have limited access to anti-retroviral therapies, psychosocial support, home-based services, while there is more access to nutritional guidance and TB screening and treatment through the national Ministry of Health health centers.
USAID Support.
Through USAID, Peru received $1.2 million in fiscal year (FY) 2009 for essential HIV/AIDS programs and services. USAID’s HIV/AIDS programs in Peru are implemented as part of the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan. Thanks to this support, Peru’s health indicators-such as life expectancy, fertility rate, and infant and maternal death rates- have improved steadily over the past several decades. However, troubling differences exist, particularly between rural and urban populations, made worse by poverty and low education levels. Also, there remain to be significant challenges associated with enacting successful prevention efforts in Peru, in particular in the rural regions where there is limited access and where some communities do not even have a word for ‘prevention’.

Janus Kamban

Janus Kamban (10 September 1913 in Tórshavn - 2 May 2009) was a Faroese sculptor and last living representative from the "first generation" of professional artists in the Faroe Islands.
Kamban is the first and most important sculptor in the Faroe Islands. In 1930 he went to Copenhagen to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts to study painting, but soon changed his direction and attended the School of Sculpture in the Art Academy from 1932 to 1935 and from 1938 to 1940, where he studied under Professor Einar Utzon-Frank. Study tours in the 1930s led him to Paris, Florence, Oslo and Stockholm. 
In his Copenhagen studio he organized the first exhibition of Faroese Art in Denmark. In addition to his own works, it included works by Gudmund Hentze, Sámal Joensen-Mikines, Elin Borg Lützen, Ruth Smith and Ingolf Jacobsen. 
During the Second World War he had to remain in German-occupied Denmark since the Faroe Islands were occupied by Britain. However, in August 1945, Kamban returned to the Faroe Islands on the first ship, the Aarhus. Once there, he immediately established himself as a sculptor. 
His first monumental work was "Móðurmálið" (mother tongue), made in 1948 from local basalt, as an anniversary memorial for V U Hammershaimb, 1846, creator of the Faroese written language. This monument is now hidden behind high bushes in Tórshavn. 
However, the bronze bust for the politician and lawyer Niels Winther (1822–92) is clearly visible at the entrance to the national library, and the 3.8 x 2.9 metre cement relief "Søgumaðurin" (the storyteller) of 1956 can be seen on the facade of a local school in Tórshavn. Other monuments produced by him can be found all over the Faroe Islands, and his subjects are common everyday practical aspects of island life: seamen, islanders, sheep, pilot whales, the Faroese chain dance and so on. He used plaster, cement, baked clay, wood, basalt and bronze. Two of his sculptures, "Sheep with two lambs" (cement, 1955) and "Four whales" (1986), are exhibited at the Faroese Art Museum. 
In addition to his sculptures, he also produced graphics, particularly linocuts, including numerous book illustrations, posters, logos and even three postage stamps. 
Since 1970 he has lived in a house on the coast (Yviri við Strond in Tórshavn) with a view to Nólsoy, built according to his specifications in the classical style, with black asphalt outside walls and grass roof. At the age of 85, he fell off his bicycle and broke his right hand and it has not healed properly, putting an end to his career as an artist.

HIV/AIDS in the Dominican Republic

The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the Dominican Republic stood at an estimated 0.7 percent, among the lowest in the Caribbean region, with an estimated 62,000 HIV/AIDS-positive Dominicans, as of 2011. A mission based in the United States has helped to combat AIDS in the Dominican Republic.
Prevalence.
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) reports that some urban areas of the Dominican Republic have HIV/AIDS infection rates well in excess of 10%.[http://data.unaids.org/Publications/Fact-Sheets01/dominicanrepublic_EN.pdf]
In some parts of the Dominican Republic, HIV/AIDS has become one of the leading cause of death among teenagers and adults between 15–49 years old. [http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q=cache:kw0V1pImgAwJ:www.usembassy.it/pdf/other/RL32001.pdf+world+health+organization+dominican+republic+hiv+aids+sex+tourism&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESii7W1kFV4NwMGV8pk7hcBL42oQGi8Tqn_jnQyp6e-aSRPSPOFrtTXNwt7P2PZVkyaKyNsz0XF2vqsS01ByfL-qELRq4isU1WtHqhQTDq4zbFUBSI2v_0RoSExBrk5N6l28kKMe&sig=AFQjCNGXPYp1sxgz83OTIsIysG3sOw8udQ Adult women living with HIV/AIDS are estimated at 23,000. [http://data.unaids.org/Publications/Fact-Sheets01/dominicanrepublic_EN.pdf] HIV prevalence in pregnant women had been relatively stable for a number of years. However, 2005 sentinel surveillance reported HIV prevalence of more than 4.5 percent in pregnant women at two sites. In 2006, sentinel surveillance of pregnant women of all ages reported seroprevalence of 3.4 percent at four sites and 5.9 percent at one site. However, in the Santo Domingo National District, antenatal clinics have noted a decline in prevalence, probably because of a successful prevention campaign.
HIV/AIDS was first reported in the Dominican Republic in 1983 and continued spreading until the mid-1990s, when prevalence started to decrease. However, due to sex tourism, child sex tourism, and prostitution in tourism industry workers, spread of the epidemic began to increase again. [http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q=cache:kw0V1pImgAwJ:www.usembassy.it/pdf/other/RL32001.pdf+world+health+organization+dominican+republic+hiv+aids+sex+tourism&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESii7W1kFV4NwMGV8pk7hcBL42oQGi8Tqn_jnQyp6e-aSRPSPOFrtTXNwt7P2PZVkyaKyNsz0XF2vqsS01ByfL-qELRq4isU1WtHqhQTDq4zbFUBSI2v_0RoSExBrk5N6l28kKMe&sig=AFQjCNGXPYp1sxgz83OTIsIysG3sOw8udQ] Heterosexual intercourse reportedly the primary form of transmission of the disease, accounting for 81 percent of HIV infections in 15- to 44-year-olds of both sexes. However, because of strong stigma against homosexuality, it is possible that the number of infections resulting from men having sex with men, or male child prostitutes, may be higher than listed or may simply go unreported.
In addition to an increase in sex tourism [http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q=cache:kw0V1pImgAwJ:www.usembassy.it/pdf/other/RL32001.pdf+world+health+organization+dominican+republic+hiv+aids+sex+tourism&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESii7W1kFV4NwMGV8pk7hcBL42oQGi8Tqn_jnQyp6e-aSRPSPOFrtTXNwt7P2PZVkyaKyNsz0XF2vqsS01ByfL-qELRq4isU1WtHqhQTDq4zbFUBSI2v_0RoSExBrk5N6l28kKMe&sig=AFQjCNGXPYp1sxgz83OTIsIysG3sOw8udQ], the country’s epidemic is driven by people with multiple sex partners, younger women in union with older men, sex workers and their clients and partners, and men who have sex with men (MSM). According to the 2002 Demographic and Health Survey, 29 percent of men had sex with more than one partner in the preceding 12 months. According to UNAIDS, females under 24 years of age are twice as likely to contract HIV as their male counterparts. This is in part due to young women having relationships with older men, who are more likely to have acquired HIV/AIDS from previous partners or exposure. A sentinel surveillance study in 2006 reported that prevalence among prostitutes, or commercial sex workers (CSWs), is 4.1 percent (2.4 to 6.5 percent, depending on location). In some sites, the prevalence among is declining and equals that of pregnant women. For example, in Santo Domingo, prevalence in sex workers has been decreasing for the last eight years and is reaching the same level as in pregnant women nationally. This may be attributable to the successful implementation of the “100% Condom Strategy” by two nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in several provinces. For example, one community project in Santo Domingo in 2006 demonstrated an increase in condom use among sex workers, from 75 percent to 94 percent in just 12 months. According to the 2005 World Health Organization (WHO)/UNAIDS AIDS Epidemic Update, a 2004 study in Puerto Plata, Samana, and Santo Domingo found that 11 percent of MSM were HIV-positive. Infection levels among sugar cane plantation workers living in communities called bateyes average 5 percent, with some groups as high as 12 percent.
According to WHO, the estimated incidence rate of tuberculosis (TB) in the Dominican Republic (40 cases per 100,000 people in 2005) is one of the highest in the Americas. Data on HIV-TB co-infection, albeit limited to certain areas of the country, suggest that 6 to 11 percent of TB patients are infected with HIV. Therefore, the Dominican Republic has the potential for a burgeoning epidemic of TB along with HIV. National HIV-TB guidelines have been recently developed and HIV-TB activities have been included in national plans. While the country has introduced some HIV-TB collaborative activities (e.g., isoniazid prophylaxis for HIV-infected people and provision of antiretroviral therapy ), there are no data on the number of HIV-infected TB patients receiving ART.
Factors that put the Dominican Republic at risk of a growing epidemic include early age at sexual debut, high birth rates among adolescent girls and young women, the high TB incidence, and active migration (including migration between cities and countryside, migration from Haiti, and migration to and from the United States). The Dominican Republic’s popularity as a tourist destination, coupled with increasing levels of sex tourism, also contributes to the spread of HIV. These and other factors suggest the need to target interventions to young adults, provinces with a high rate of tourism, and bateyes.
National response.
The Government of the Dominican Republic has responded aggressively to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Established in 2000, the Presidential Council on AIDS (COPRESIDA) coordinates the HIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan for the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS and STDs 2007–2015. COPRESIDA’s activities include implementing public policies, providing care for those living with HIV/AIDS, promoting private sector involvement in response to the epidemic, and reducing stigma and discrimination (S&D). The Ministry of Health (MOH) implements HIV/AIDS services and diagnostic tests in the public sector. The National AIDS Program (NAP) develops HIV/AIDS-related norms, protocols, and surveillance.
National-level government-directed activities include the following:
Since 1995, an AIDS law has made it illegal to discriminate against PLWHA. The law is unique for the region; however,
enforcement is uneven and inconsistent, and S&D against PLWHA and those engaging in behaviors putting them most at risk
for HIV/AIDS are common.
The government works with a number of international donors to combat HIV/AIDS, including the William J. Clinton Foundation,
UNICEF, the United Nations Population Fund, the World Bank, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
In 2004, the Dominican Republic received a second-round grant from the Global Fund to scale up HIV services throughout the
country, with particular focus on vulnerable groups, including female sex workers, MSM, and migrants. With Global Fund
support, the government also intends to scale up ART.

Peter Jackson

Sir Peter Robert Jackson (born 31 October 1961) is a New Zealand film director, producer and screenwriter. He is best known for "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy (2001–2003) and its prequel "The Hobbit" trilogy (2012–2014), which are adapted from the novels of the same name by J. R. R. Tolkien. Other notable films include "Heavenly Creatures" (1994), "Forgotten Silver" (1995), "The Frighteners" (1996), "King Kong" (2005) and "The Lovely Bones" (2009). He also produced "District 9" (2009), "The Adventures of Tintin" (2011) and the documentary "West of Memphis" (2012). 
Jackson began his career with the "splatstick" horror comedies "Bad Taste" (1987) the black comedy "Meet the Feebles" (1989) before filming "Braindead" (1992). He shared an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay nomination with his partner Fran Walsh for the film "Heavenly Creatures", which brought him to mainstream prominence in the film industry. Jackson has been awarded three Academy Awards in his career, including the award for Best Director in 2003, and has been nominated for nine Academy Awards overall. He has also received a Golden Globe, four Saturn Awards and three BAFTAs amongst others.
His production company is Wingnut Films, and his most regular collaborators are co-writers and producers Walsh and Philippa Boyens. Jackson was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2002. He was later knighted (as a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit) by Anand Satyanand, the Governor-General of New Zealand, at a ceremony in Wellington in April 2010.
Early life.
Jackson was born on 31 October, 1961 in Wellington and was raised at the nearby coastal town of Pukerua Bay. His parents - Joan (née Ruck), a factory worker and housewife, and William (Bill) Jackson, a wages clerk - were both immigrants from England. His father was a veteran of the Siege of Malta in World War II. As a child, Jackson was a keen film fan, growing up on Ray Harryhausen films as well as finding inspiration in the television series "Thunderbirds" and "Monty Python's Flying Circus". After a family friend gave the Jacksons a Super 8 cine-camera with Peter in mind, he began making short films with his friends. Jackson has long cited "King Kong" as his favourite film and around the age of nine he attempted to remake it using his own stop-motion models. Also as a child Jackson made a WWII epic called "The Dwarf Patrol" seen on the Bad Taste bonus disc which featured his first special effect of poking pinholes in the film for gun shots, and a James Bond spoof named "Coldfinger". Most notably though was a 20-minute short called "The Valley" which won him a special prize because of the shots he used.
In school, Jackson expressed no interest (or skill) in sports. His classmates also remember him wearing a duffle coat with "an obsession verging on religious". Jackson had no formal training in film-making, but learned about editing, special effects and make-up largely through his own trial and error. As a young adult, Jackson discovered the work of author J. R. R. Tolkien after watching "The Lord of the Rings" (1978), an animated film by Ralph Bakshi that was a part-adaptation of Tolkien's fantasy trilogy. When he was 16 years old, Jackson left school and began working full-time as a photo-engraver for the local newspaper. For the 7 years he worked there, Jackson lived at home with his parents so he could save as much money as possible to spend on film equipment. After two years of work Jackson bought a 16 mm camera, and began shooting a film that later became "Bad Taste".
Influences and inspirations.
Jackson has long cited several films as influence. It is a well known fact that Jackson has a passion for "King Kong" often citing it as his favourite film and also the film that inspired him early in his life. Jackson recalls attempting to remake "King Kong" when he was 12. At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, while being interviewed alongside "Avatar" and "Titanic" director James Cameron, Jackson gave some further insight into his influences saying certain films gave him a "kick". He also cited the Martin Scorsese directed films "Goodfellas" and "Casino" as inspirational, saying, "Something about those particular movies and the way Martin Scorsese just fearlessly rockets his camera around and has shot those films that I can watch those movies and feel inspired." Jackson also says the 1970 film "Waterloo" inspired him in his youth.
Career.
The splatter phase.
Jackson's first feature, "Bad Taste", a haphazard fashion splatter comedy, which included many of Jackson's friends acting and working on it for free. Shooting was normally done in the weekends since Jackson was then working full-time. "Bad Taste" is about aliens that come to earth with the intention of turning humans into food. Jackson had two acting roles including a famous scene in which he fights himself on top of a cliff.
The film was finally completed thanks to a late injection of finance from the New Zealand Film Commission, after Jim Booth, the body's executive director, became convinced of Jackson's talent (Booth later left the Commission to become Jackson's producer). In May 1987, "Bad Taste" was unveiled at the Cannes Film Festival, where rights to the film quickly sold to twelve countries.
Around this time Peter Jackson began working on writing a number of film scripts, in varied collaborative groupings with playwright Stephen Sinclair, writer Fran Walsh and writer/actor Danny Mulheron. Walsh would later become his life partner. Some of the scripts from this period, including a sequel to "A Nightmare on Elm Street", have never been made into movies; the proposed zombie film "Braindead" underwent extensive rewrites.
Jackson's next film to see release was "Meet the Feebles" (1989), co-written by the four writers mentioned above. An ensemble musical comedy starring Muppet-style puppets, "Meet the Feebles" originally began as a short film intended for television, but was rapidly expanded into a full-length film after unexpected enthusiasm from Japanese investors, and the collapse of "Braindead", six weeks before filming. Begun on a very low budget, "Meet the Feebles" went weeks over schedule. Jackson stated of his second feature length film, "It's got a quality of humour that alienates a lot of people.. It's very black, very satirical, very savage." "Feebles" marked Jackson's first collaboration with special effects team Richard Taylor and Tania Rodger, who would later work on all Jackson's movies.
Jackson's next release was the horror comedy "Braindead" (1992) (released in North America as "Dead Alive"), now seen as a landmark in splatter movies. Originally planned as a Spanish co-production, the film reversed the usual zombie plot. Rather than keeping the zombies out of his place of refuge, the hero attempts to keep them inside, while maintaining a façade of normality. The film features extensive special effects including miniature trams, stop motion and a plethora of gory make-up effects.
"Heavenly Creatures" and "Forgotten Silver".
Released in 1994 after Jackson won a race to bring the story to the screen, "Heavenly Creatures" marked a major change for Jackson in terms of both style and tone. The film is based on real-life events: namely the Parker–Hulme murder case in which two teenage girls in 1950s Christchurch became close friends and later murdered the mother of one of the girls. Jackson's partner Fran Walsh helped persuade him that the events had the makings of a movie; Jackson has been quoted saying that the film "only got made" because of her enthusiasm for the subject matter. Many New Zealanders were apprehensive about how Jackson would treat the material, an apprehension that would later turn in many cases to relief. The film's fame coincided with the New Zealand media tracking down the real-life Juliet Hulme, who now writes books under the name Anne Perry. Jackson would cast the actors Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet in the roles of Parker and Hulme. "Heavenly Creatures" received considerable critical acclaim, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay and making top ten of the year lists in "Time", "The Guardian", "The Sydney Morning Herald", and "The New Zealand Herald". The success of "Heavenly Creatures" won Jackson attention from US company Miramax, who promoted the film vigorously in America and signed the director to a first-look deal.
The following year, in collaboration with Wellington film-maker Costa Botes, Jackson co-directed the mockumentary "Forgotten Silver" (1995). This ambitious made-for-television piece told the story of New Zealand film pioneer Colin McKenzie, who had supposedly invented colour film and 'talkies', and attempted an epic film of "Salome" before being forgotten by the world. Though the programme played in a slot normally reserved for drama, no other warning was given that it was fictionalised and many viewers were outraged at discovering Colin McKenzie had never existed. The number of people who believed the increasingly improbable story provides testimony to Jackson and Botes' skill at playing on New Zealand's national myth of a nation of innovators and forgotten trail-blazers.
Hollywood, Weta, and the Film Commission.
The success of "Heavenly Creatures" helped pave the way for Jackson's first big budget Hollywood film, "The Frighteners" starring Michael J. Fox, in 1996. Thanks partly to support from American producer Robert Zemeckis, Jackson was given permission to make this comedy/horror film entirely in New Zealand despite being set in a North American town. This period was a key one of change for both Jackson and Weta Workshop, the special effects company—born from the one-man contributions of George Port to "Heavenly Creatures"—with which Jackson is often associated. Weta, initiated by Jackson and key collaborators, grew rapidly during this period to incorporate both digital and physical effects, make-up and costumes, the first two areas normally commanded by Jackson collaborator Richard Taylor.
"The Frighteners" was regarded as a commercial failure. Some critics expressed disappointment that it displayed little of the anarchistic humor of Jackson's early movies and that the script felt underdeveloped. In February 1997, Jackson launched legal proceedings against the "New Zealand Listener" magazine for defamation, over a review of "The Frighteners" which claimed that the film was "built from the rubble of other people's movies". In the end, the case was not pursued further. Around this time Jackson's remake of "King Kong" was shelved by Universal Studios, partly because of "Mighty Joe Young" and "Godzilla", both giant monster movies, that had already gone into production. Universal feared it would be thrown aside by the two higher budget movies.
This period of transition seems not to have been entirely a happy one; it also marked one of the high points of tension between Jackson and the New Zealand Film Commission since "Meet the Feebles" had gone over-budget earlier in his career. Jackson has claimed the Commission considered firing him from "Feebles", though the NZFC went on to help fund his next three films. In 1997, the director submitted a lengthy criticism of the Commission for a magazine supplement meant to celebrate the body's 20th anniversary, criticising what he called inconsistent decision-making by inexperienced board members. The magazine felt that the material was too long and potentially defamatory to publish in that form; a shortened version of the material went on to appear in "Metro" magazine. In the "Metro" article Jackson criticized the Commission over funding decisions concerning a film he was hoping to executive produce, but refused to drop a client-confidentiality clause that allowed them to publicly reply to his criticisms.
"The Lord of the Rings".
Peter Jackson won the rights to film J. R. R. Tolkien's epic in 1997 after meeting with producer Saul Zaentz. Originally working with Miramax towards a two-film production, Jackson was later pressured to render the story as a single film, and finally overcame a tight deadline by making a last minute deal with New Line, who were keen on a trilogy.
Principal photography stretched from 11 October 1999 to 22 December 2000 with extensive location filming across New Zealand. With the benefit of extended post-production and extra periods of shooting before each film's release, the series met huge success and sent Jackson's popularity soaring. "" itself met with huge critical acclaim, winning eleven Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. The film was the first of the fantasy film genre to win the award for Best Picture and was the second sequel to win Best Picture (the first being "The Godfather Part II").
Jackson's mother, Joan, died three days before the release of the first movie in the trilogy, "". There was a special showing of the film after her funeral.
Following "The Return of the King", Jackson lost a large amount of weight –over to the point of being unrecognisable to some fans. In "The Daily Telegraph", he attributed his weight loss to his diet. He said, "I just got tired of being overweight and unfit, so I changed my diet from hamburgers to yogurt and muesli and it seems to work."
"King Kong".
Universal Studios signed Peter Jackson for a second time to remake the 1933 classic "King Kong"—the film that inspired him to become a film director as a child. He was reportedly paid a fee of US$20 million upfront, the highest salary ever paid to date to a film director in advance of production, against a 20 percent take of the box-office rentals (the portion of the price of the ticket that goes to the film distributor, in this case Universal). The film was released on 14 December 2005, and grossed around US$550 million worldwide.
"The Lovely Bones".
Jackson completed an adaptation of Alice Sebold's bestseller, "The Lovely Bones", which was released in the United States on 11 December 2009. Jackson has said the film was a welcome relief from his larger-scale epics. The storyline's combination of fantasy aspects and themes of murder bears some similarities to "Heavenly Creatures".
The film ended up receiving generally negative reviews and middling box office returns. It currently holds 32% rotten on Rotten Tomatoes.
Current and future projects.
Jackson had talked of producing films for others as early as 1995, but a number of factors slowed developments in this regard, including the failure of "Jack Brown Genius" (1995). After he became a force in Hollywood, he was set to produce a $128 million movie version of the science fiction video game series "Halo", but the project went on hold when financial backers withdrew their support. Instead Jackson worked with "Halo" director Neill Blomkamp on science fiction project "District 9", which proved a box office hit and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture.
Jackson was set to produce a remake of "The Dam Busters", to be directed by longtime Weta designer Christian Rivers. Stephen Fry has written a screenplay. Originally scheduled for 2009–10, the project has been postponed.
Jackson has also won the rights to a film adaptation of the fantasy novel series "Temeraire", a novel about dragons being used in combat in the Napoleonic Wars and a dragon named Temeraire and his captain, Will Laurence, written by Naomi Novik. It remains to be seen if he will direct it.
In recent years, Jackson has also directed a short film entitled "Crossing the Line" to test a new model of digital cinema camera, the RED ONE. The film takes place during World War I, and was shot in two days. "Crossing the Line" was shown at NAB 2007 (the USA National Association of Broadcasters). Clips of the film can be found at Reduser.net.
Jackson and his newly formed studio Wingnut Interactive were working on an unrevealed project being developed by Microsoft Game Studios in collaboration with Bungie Studios. The project has been officially titled "" but beyond speculation little else was known about its nature. He was to be the executive producer on a "Halo" film, developed and released by Universal Studios and 20th Century Fox but in October 2006 the film was postponed indefinitely. The film was never officially cancelled. In June 2008 Peter Jackson commented that, "With upcoming developments (Halo: Chronicles), I wouldn't know when to expect a movie, and I'm the producer."
Jackson spent $5 million to purchase 20 hectares of land in Wairarapa, a property containing a mansion, private lake, tunnel and the interior of Bag End from "The Lord of the Rings". In 2009, he purchased a Gulfstream G550 jet; his total net worth is estimated by "National Business Review" at NZ$450 million. Jackson owns an aircraft restoration and manufacturing company, The Vintage Aviator, which is dedicated to World War I and World War II fighter planes among other planes from the 1920s and 1930s. He is chairman of the Omaka Aviation Heritage Trust, which hosts a biennial air show.
In late December 2009, Peter Jackson announced his interest on the movie adaption of the novel "Mortal Engines". In April 2010 it was confirmed that he would be both director and producer of the project.
"Tintin" franchise.
Jackson was one of three producers on "The Adventures of Tintin", directed by Steven Spielberg and released in 2011. He is officially labeled as producer but helped Spielberg, before he began working on "", directing the film. Jamie Bell and Andy Serkis were cast due to their collaboration with Peter Jackson on "King Kong" and "The Lord of the Rings". Spielberg also chose to work with Peter Jackson due to the impressive digital work on the "Lord of the Rings" films, and knew Peter Jackson's company Weta Workshop would make his vision a reality. It received positive reviews and grossed $373 million at the box office.
In December 2011, Spielberg confirmed a sequel to his 3D movie will be made and are said to be based on "The Seven Crystal Balls" and "Prisoners of the Sun". He explained the Thompson detectives will "have a much bigger role". The sequel will be produced by Spielberg and directed by Jackson. Kathleen Kennedy said the script might be done by February or March 2012 and motion-captured in summer 2012, so that the movie will be on track to be released on either Christmas 2014 or summer 2015. In February 2012, Spielberg revealed to "Total Film" that they had completed a story outline for the sequel.
During a press tour in Belgium for "" in December 2012, Jackson said that the plan for a Tintin sequel would be to shoot the performance capture sometime in 2013, with a release date aimed for 2015. On March 12, 2013, in a visit to India to celebrate the success of his film "Lincoln", Spielberg was asked by "The Times of India" about the status of the Tintin sequel. In response, Spielberg said, "Don't hold me to it, but we're hoping the film will come out around Christmas-time in 2015. We know which books we're making, we can't share that now but we're combining two books which were always intended to be combined by Herge."
"The Hobbit".
Jackson's involvement in the making of a film version of "The Hobbit" has a long and chequered history. In November 2006, a letter from Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh stated that due to an ongoing legal dispute between Wingnut Films (Jackson's production company) and New Line Cinema, Jackson would not be directing the film. New Line Cinema's head Robert Shaye commented that Jackson "...will never make any movie with New Line Cinema again while I'm still working at the company...". This prompted an online call for a boycott of New Line Cinema, and by August 2007 Shaye was trying to repair his working relationship. On 18 December 2007, it was announced that Peter Jackson and New Line Cinema had reached agreement to make two prequels, both based on "The Hobbit", and to be released in 2012 and 2013 with Jackson as a writer and executive producer and Guillermo del Toro directing.
However, in early 2010, del Toro dropped out of directing the film because of production delays and a month later Jackson was back in negotiations to direct "The Hobbit"; and on 15 October he was finalised as the director—with New Zealand confirmed as the location a couple of weeks later. The film started production on 20 March 2011. On 30 July 2012, Peter Jackson announced via his Facebook page that the two planned 'Hobbit' movies would be expanded into a trilogy. The third film will not act as a bridge between "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings" films, but would continue to expand "The Hobbit" story by using material found in the "Lord of the Rings Appendices".
Games.
Jackson was set to make games with Microsoft Game Studios, a partnership announced on 27 September 2006, at X06. Specifically, Jackson and Microsoft were teaming together to form a new studio called Wingnut Interactive. In collaboration with Bungie Studios, Jackson was to co-write, co-design and co-produce a new game taking place in the Halo universe – tentatively called '. However on 27 July 2009, in an interview about his new movie (as producer) "District 9", he said that ' had been cancelled, while Microsoft confirmed that the game is "on hold". Jackson's game studio Wingnut Interactive is now at work on original intellectual property.
Charitable activities.
Jackson has given NZ$500,000 to stem cell research.
He purchased a church in the Wellington suburb of Seatoun for about $10 million, saving it from demolition.
He also contributes his expertise to 48HOURS, a New Zealand film-making competition, through annually selecting 3 "Wildcards" for the National Final.
Jackson, a World War I aviation enthusiast, is chair of the 14–18 Aviation Heritage Trust. He donated his services and provided replica aircraft to create a 10 minute multimedia display called "Over the Front" for the Australian War Memorial in 2008.
He contributed to the defense fund for the West Memphis Three.
In 2011, Jackson and Walsh purchased 1 Kent Terrace, the home of BATS Theatre in Wellington, effectively securing the theatre's future.
Style.
Jackson is known for his attention to detail, a habit of shooting scenes from many angles, a macabre sense of humour, and a general playfulness – the latter to the point where "The Lord of the Rings" conceptual designer Alan Lee jokingly remarked "the film is almost incidental really".
Jackson was a noted perfectionist on the "Lord of the Rings" shoot, where he demanded numerous takes of scenes, requesting additional takes by repeatedly saying, "one more for luck". Jackson is also renowned within the New Zealand film industry for his insistence on "coverage"—shooting a scene from as many angles as possible, giving him more options during editing. Jackson has been known to spend days shooting a single scene. This is evident in his work where even scenes featuring simple conversations often feature a wide array of multiple camera angles and shot-sizes as well as zooming closeups on characters' faces. One of his most common visual trademarks is shooting close-ups of actors with wide-angle lenses.
Unlike some other film directors, Jackson has remained in his native country to make films. This has been the genesis of several production and support companies. Most of Jackson's assets are found on the Miramar Peninsula in his home town of Wellington where much of his filming occurs; and he was instrumental in having the world premiere of "The Return of the King" in the city's iconic Embassy Theatre which he helped restore.
He was an early user of computer enhancement technology and provided digital special effects to a number of Hollywood films by use of telecommunications and satellite links to transmit raw images and the final results across the Pacific Ocean.
During filming of "The Lord of the Rings", Jackson was famous for wearing shorts and going barefoot under most circumstances, especially during film shoots.
Cameo roles.
Jackson is one of the lead actors in two of his films: in "Bad Taste", he plays two characters named Derek and Robert, even engaging them both in a fight. In the mockumentary "Forgotten Silver", he plays his own role.
However he appears in every film he directed, mostly in cameos:
He has also made cameos in several films not directed by him. In the opening sequence of "Hot Fuzz" (2007), he played a demented man dressed as Father Christmas, who stabs Nicholas Angel (played by Simon Pegg) in the hand. Pegg, in the commentary, joked that when Jackson saw that his cameo was extremely short, he walked out of the cinema and walked in circles in the hallway for the rest of the duration of the film.
Jackson's eldest son, Billy (born 1995), has made cameo appearances in every one of his father's films since his birth, namely "The Frighteners" (1996), "The Lord of the Rings" film trilogy, and "King Kong". His daughter, Katie (born 1996), appears in all the above films except "The Frighteners". His life-partner and co-writer Fran Walsh makes a short cameo in "The Frighteners" as a woman walking next to Cyrus and Stuar just prior the scene featuring their son Billy.
Jackson had a cameo on the HBO show "Entourage" in 5 August 2007 episode, "Gary's Desk", in which he offers a business proposal to Eric Murphy, manager to the lead character, Vincent Chase.
Jackson also appears as himself in the 2013 "Doctor Who" 50th anniversary spoof "The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot", alongside Ian McKellen.
Jackson appeared briefly in an airline passenger safety video for Air New Zealand, made in the style of a Hobbit movie, called "An Unexpected Briefing".

<doc id="19222558" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19222558" title="HIV/AIDS in El Salvador">
HIV/AIDS in El Salvador

HIV/AIDS in El Salvador has a less than 1 percent prevalence of the adult population reported to be HIV-positive, El Salvador and therefore there is a low-HIV-prevalence country, but the virus remains a significant threat in high-risk communities, such as commercial sex workers (CSWs) and men who have sex with men (MSM).
Prevalence.
Overall prevalence has increased since the first case was detected in 1984. Since that time, 18,282 HIV/AIDS cases have been reported in the country. Incidence appears to have declined since 2004, but there is a fear that because of the lack of an effective monitoring system, many HIV/AIDS cases are not reported (according to a UNAIDS May 2006 report, 40 to 50 percent of cases are under-reported). Heterosexual sex is the main route of HIV transmission in El Salvador, accounting for 79 percent of HIV cases in the country. The epidemic is predominantly in urban areas and is becoming increasingly feminized as the percent of women with HIV rises. Although prevalence is 3 percent among sex workers, it is as high as 16 percent in specific areas, such as Puerto de Acajutla. Prevalence is also high among MSM (17.8 percent, the highest in Central America). One study from 2002 reported by UNAIDS in 2007 demonstrated that infection levels among MSM in El Salvador were 22 times higher than among the general population. Moreover, stigma and discrimination (S&D) against MSM lead to hidden behaviors, and, as a result, there is probably considerable under-reporting of the epidemic among this group. The National AIDS Program (NAP) estimates that 51 percent of reported AIDS cases occur in the 25- to 34-year-old age group. Although estimates vary, about 85 percent of infections are sexually transmitted, of which 4 percent are cases of homosexual transmission and 3 percent bisexual transmission. According to the national sexually transmitted disease (STD) and HIV/AIDS program, the range for new HIV/AIDS infections per day is between 4.5 and 5.5 cases. Mortality due to AIDS represented the seventh-leading cause of death in hospitals for the population as a whole and the leading cause in the 20 to 59 age group. El Salvador contributes 18.4 percent of all cases in the Central America subregion and has the third-largest number of cases behind Honduras and Guatemala.
Factors that put El Salvador at risk of a larger epidemic include early initiation of sex, limited knowledge or practice of preventive practices among people engaging in high-risk behaviors, and the country’s large mobile population. The National Health Survey conducted in 2002 and 2003 indicated that 32 percent of females aged 15 to 19 were already sexually active. Knowledge about HIV/AIDS remains somewhat limited, as evidenced by one multicenter study in which 40 percent of MSM had false beliefs about the modes of transmission of HIV. Among sex workers, an estimated 90 percent do not use condoms with regular partners. Compounding these issues are S&D toward HIV-infected individuals and at-risk groups, which can deter people from getting tested and receiving adequate support if they have the disease.
National response.
Although the Government of El Salvador began initial HIV/AIDS prevention activities as early as 1988, stigma surrounding HIV persists. In 2001, El Salvador passed legislation protecting patients’ rights and guaranteeing access to treatment.
El Salvador’s NAP was established in 1987, and it continues to work closely with various state ministries, civil society, the private sector, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The country is now implementing its fourth HIV/AIDS strategic plan for 2005 to 2010. The new plan aims to improve the population’s knowledge about HIV/AIDS, strengthen preventive and protective measures, and extend coverage of HIV/AIDS services for vulnerable groups.
Following the worldwide Three Ones principles, El Salvador formed the National AIDS Commission (CONASIDA) to act as the country’s AIDS coordinating mechanism. One of the achievements of CONASIDA was the development of the 2005 National Policy for Comprehensive HIV Care. Important government activities include signing the Declaration of San Salvador for fighting AIDS in Central America and the Caribbean and the creation of an HIV/AIDS/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention program for mobile populations. The latter is particularly important because El Salvador is a corridor for migrants. El Salvador is also implementing the Regional HIV/STI Plan for the Health Sector 2006-2015 of the Pan American Health Organization.
Free HIV testing began in El Salvador in 1997, and in January 2002, the Ministry of Health (MOH) began to offer antiretroviral treatment (ART). By December 2006, 174 health facilities and two mobile clinics offered HIV testing for free, and 3,447 people were receiving ART without charge. In cooperation with other countries in the region, the Salvadoran Government negotiated with major pharmaceutical manufacturers and received price reductions on antiretroviral drugs. Currently, 39 percent of people infected with HIV who need ART receive it. In 2003, the country began a national program called Make the Decision to Wait to teach adolescents about safer sexual behaviors and to abstain from sex, and in 2005, two major campaigns were launched to combat stigma against people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).
President Elías Antonio Saca González declared June 27, 2007, National HIV Testing Day. With the support of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the regional NGO Pan American Social Marketing Organization (PASMO) managed the event’s publicity campaign. The campaign resulted in 54,461 tests, exceeding the 40,000 target. Nearly three times the normal monthly average of tests done in all of 2006 were conducted on this one day. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is also currently supporting the MOH and the United Nations Development Program to develop a strategy for fighting HIV/AIDS in vulnerable populations to help poverty reduction. Despite these efforts, improved monitoring and surveillance and campaigns to raise awareness are needed.

HIV/AIDS in Guatemala

Prevalence.
With less than 1 percent of the adult population estimated to be HIV-positive, Guatemala is considered to have a concentrated epidemic. However, Guatemala – Central America’s largest country – accounts for nearly one-sixth of Central America’s HIV-infected population. Since the country’s first case of HIV was reported in 1984, infections have occurred primarily among men who have sex with men (MSM) and sex workers. According to the National AIDS Program (NAP) in the Ministry of Health (MOH), as of April 2007, Guatemala had 10,304 officially reported cases of HIV/AIDS. UNAIDS estimates that 61,000 people are living with HIV in Guatemala and 2,700 deaths have occurred due to AIDS.
Guatemala’s HIV-infected population lives primarily in urban areas along major transportation routes. According to Guatemala’s 2007 National Epidemiological Center report, more than 77 percent of reported HIV/AIDS cases occurred in seven departments: Suchitepéquez, Guatemala, Izabal, Escuintla, Retalhuleu, San Marcos, and Quetzaltenango. The NAP estimates that 80 percent of reported HIV cases have occurred among 15- to 49-year-olds, with 20- to 34-year-olds accounting for more than 51 percent of all cases. National HIV prevalence among sex workers is 4 percent, and among street-based female sex workers prevalence is as high as 12 percent. National HIV prevalence among MSM is 10 percent, but in Guatemala City, 18 percent of MSM were HIV-positive in 2006, according to baseline data collected for a Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria project. A 2002 study published by UNAIDS in 2007 showed that infection levels among MSM in Guatemala is 10 times higher than in the adult general population. Other vulnerable populations include prison inmates, with a reported prevalence of 3.2 percent, and at-risk youth and street children, with HIV prevalence at 3.3 percent. According to the MOH, no cases of infection have been reported among injecting drug users or through blood or blood products. Available data indicate that HIV has affected mainly urban and Ladino (mixed Amerindian-Spanish peoples) populations; however, preliminary data indicate that the indigenous population (primarily Mayans) potentially could be experiencing increasing HIV infections. The data are insufficient, however, to determine the extent of the epidemic within this population.
Several risk factors contribute to Guatemala’s epidemic, including migration and tourism. While in transit, migrants may participate in high-risk sexual behavior, increasing their chances of becoming infected with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The Garifuna population, which shares cultural and ethnic characteristics with the Caribbean countries, is more at risk than the general population. The effects of HIV/AIDS are exacerbated by high levels of poverty and limited access to health care, particularly among rural populations.
The rate of HIV co-infection with tuberculosis (TB) is growing. The current rate of new TB infections is 34 per 100,000 people and a 2006 study cited by UNAIDS found that HIV prevalence among new TB patients in Quetzaltenango tripled from 4.2 to 12 percent between 1995 and 2002. TB is the most frequent opportunistic infection associated with HIV/AIDS in Guatemala.
National response.
According to the 2003 AIDS Program Effort Index, a tool developed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to measure the collective effort put into an effective HIV/AIDS response by individuals and domestic and international organizations, Guatemala had a score of 52, which is an improvement from the score in 1996 but still slightly lower than the average score of 55 for Latin America and the Caribbean region. It ranked highest in the areas of political support and prevention programs.
The NAP has been responsible for surveillance of the epidemic since 1984. However, sentinel surveillance was not established until 1998. Over the past several years, the Guatemalan government has taken concrete steps to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. A national strategic plan was produced for 1999 to 2003. At the end of 2005, Guatemala adopted a new national HIV/AIDS policy, along with a new strategic plan for 2006 to 2010. The plan charges the NAP with coordinating national responses, including those from civil society. UNAIDS works with the NAP, and USAID provides technical assistance to implement the national strategic plan and establish key universal access targets. Decentralization of AIDS care and prevention services throughout the country is an important priority.
In recent years, the NAP has improved communication with civil society and other institutions to coordinate national efforts. This has resulted in the establishment of NAP-led technical committees with multisectoral participation to address such issues as standardizing diagnosis, treatment, and care. Moreover, the Country Coordination Mechanism serves as an inter-institutional coordinating body, aimed at better implementing Global Fund projects. Guatemala is also implementing the Regional HIV/STI Plan for the Health Sector 2006–2015 of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The Plan is designed to assist health services and systems in the Americas to more effectively respond to the HIV epidemic and prevent STIs.
Antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage has expanded over the years, and currently, 76 percent of identified HIV-infected men and women who need treatment receive ART, according to the NAP. The recent WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF report Towards Universal Access estimates that 52 percent of HIV-infected people who need treatment receive ART. However, because the expansion and decentralization of services has been slow, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) must travel long distances to obtain treatment, imposing cost burdens on them. There are major challenges in extending both prevention and care coverage outside the capital and other main cities. Furthermore, discrimination against PLWHA and vulnerable groups such as commercial sex workers and MSM remains a significant barrier to a more effective AIDS response in Guatemala. USAID has supported a national campaign focusing on the diversity of PLWHA to help break down barriers of stigma and discrimination (S&D) and promote respect for human rights related to HIV/AIDS.
Guatemala receives significant support from the Global Fund to expand prevention, care, and treatment activities among vulnerable groups and in priority geographic areas of the country. The objectives of the Global Fund are to expand prevention activities and ART services from the capital city to regions with the highest HIV incidence; to improve coordination among civil society organizations working in HIV/AIDS; and to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV by expanding voluntary screening and counseling for pregnant women. Bilateral donors, including USAID and European countries, also provide support for prevention, treatment, care, and health system improvement initiatives.

Frøya Church

Frøya Church () is a parish church in Bremanger Municipality in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway. It is located in the village of Kalvåg, on the southern coast of the small island of Frøya. The church is part of the Frøya parish in the Nordfjord deanery in the Diocese of Bjørgvin.
This is a wooden "long church" that was built in 1865. The church, with a seating capacity of 400, was consecrated on 11 December 1865, by the dean Johan Carl Christie. The architect was the painter artist Anders Askevold from nearby Askvoll municipality. The church building was remodeled in 1933, 1940, and 1961. The altarpiece dates back to 1720 when it was used in the old church, located in Grotle (just west of the village of Bremanger).
History.
The old church on Bremangerlandet island was located at the small village of Grotle, just west of the main village of Bremanger. That aging church was torn down in 1865 and it was replaced with this church, located at Kalvåg, about to the south. The new church at Kalvåg carried over the old "Bremanger Church" name to this new church site, since it was the main church for the Bremanger parish. Later, in 1914, a new church was built in the village of Bremanger, but that was named Bremangerpollen Chapel. This caused some controversy since Bremanger Church was located in Kalvåg (not Bremanger village). In 1952, after the church at Bremanger village had existed for 37 years, a change of names was finally decided. The church on the island of Frøya was named "Frøya Church", and Bremangerpollen Chapel was given the name "Bremanger Church".

HIV/AIDS in Honduras

Prevalence.
Honduras is home to 17% of Central America’s population. Honduras is also where 60% of the region’s HIV infections are reported. HIV is spreading slowly but steadily in many populations, and infections occur in equal proportions among men and women.
The highest rates of HIV infection occur in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. Prevalence in some vulnerable populations is high.
Studies of HIV prevalence in Honduras cited by the United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) include the following:
AIDS is the leading cause of death among Honduran women of childbearing age and is the second-leading cause of hospitalization among both men and women. Sexually transmitted infections are common, and condom use in risky sexual encounters is sporadic and variable.
National response.
National efforts to reduce the number of new HIV infections have been in place since the late 1980s. President Maduro has publicly committed himself to support the national response to HIV/AIDS, and HIV/AIDS is one of five health issues that receive priority government attention. A second national strategic plan for the 2002–2006 period is in place, but its focus and application have been stymied by a lack of national funds for its implementation. The national response to HIV/AIDS has been led by the Ministry of Health, with collaboration from other ministries and several nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The ministry now provides antiretroviral treatment to more than 3,000 individuals with AIDS.
Honduras’s long-term plan is to prevent new infections and to provide services to those who are most at risk for HIV infection, including young people, sex workers, men who have sex with men, institutionalized persons, and the Garifuna ethnic group. Honduras has been promised more than $40 million from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and thus far has received $13.7 million to implement its long-term health goals, $7.98 million of which is specifically for HIV/AIDS. This grant, combined with bilateral assistance other countries, will allow Honduras to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the coming years.

Primbee is a small suburb of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. It is located on the northern spit separating Lake Illawarra and the Pacific Ocean. Primbee is close to Windang and Warrawong in the Illawarra.
History.
The source of the name Primbee is uncertain. Farms in the area were owned in the 1860s by James Stewart, David James and Thomas Griffin. An 1893 map for the Parish of Wollongong shows the bay off Purry Burry Point as Primbee Bay. The area was subdivided and the land was offered for sale in 1919, not as Primbee but as "The Lake Suburb". 
One resident of the area in the 1920s recalled that "I came to Primbee in 1920... My parents were one of the first to buy property, when the estate was cut up. It was called Lake Suburb Estate at the time. I don't known how it came to be called Primbee. No one here was asked or told. It just came."
The local public school (Primbee Public School) was established in 1938. The principal as of 2013 is Dorothy Cass. It had an enrolment of 80 students covering Kindergarten to Year 6 at the beginning of 2011.

DHH (hedgehog)

Desert hedgehog homolog (Drosophila), also known as DHH is a human gene. The protein encoded by this gene is involved in cell signaling. It is named for the Desert Hedgehog.
Function.
This gene encodes a member of the Hedgehog family. The hedgehog gene family encodes signaling molecules that play an important role in regulating morphogenesis. This protein is predicted to be made as a precursor that is autocatalytically cleaved; the N-terminal portion is soluble and contains the signalling activity while the C-terminal portion is involved in precursor processing. More importantly, the C-terminal product covalently attaches a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal product, restricting the N-terminal product to the cell surface and preventing it from freely diffusing throughout the organism. Defects in this protein have been associated with partial gonadal dysgenesis (PGD) accompanied by minifascicular polyneuropathy. This protein may be involved in both male gonadal differentiation and perineurial development.

HIV/AIDS in Jamaica

HIV/AIDS in Jamaica has a 1.5 percent prevalence of the adult population estimated to be HIV-positive and no significant change over the last five years and therefore Jamaica appears to have stabilized its HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Prevalence.
Recent data from high-risk groups suggest that at least 9 percent of commercial sex workers and 20 to 30 percent of men who have sex with men (MSM) are estimated to be HIV-positive. Men and women aged 20 to 39 account for 54 percent of reported AIDS cases in Jamaica. First detected in 1982, HIV is present in all of Jamaica’s parishes, but Kingston, St. Andrew, and St. James – the three most urbanized parishes – have the majority of cases. UNAIDS estimates that 25,000 people in Jamaica are HIV-infected.
The primary contributors to the epidemic are sociocultural, behavioral, and economic factors that result in risky behaviors such as multiple sex partners, older men having sex with younger women, and early sexual debut. A 2004 Behavioral Surveillance Survey demonstrated that 89 percent of males and 78 percent of females aged 15 to 24 had sex with a nonmarital or noncohabitating partner in the preceding 12 months (2006). Fifty-six percent of males and 16 percent of females had multiple sex partners in the preceding 12 months. Among patients attending sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics in Kingston, St. Andrew, and St. James, HIV infection rates reached 5 percent. In the general population, overall AIDS case rates among men continue to exceed the rates among women. However, surveillance data, as presented by Dr. Peter Figueroa of Jamaica’s Ministry of Health (MOH) at the U.S. Government-sponsored sixth annual Caribbean U.S. Chiefs of Mission Conference on HIV/AIDS held in Jamaica in October 2007, indicate that adolescent females (10 to 19 years old) are 2.7 times more likely to be infected than same-age males. Young women are particularly at risk because they find it difficult to negotiate whether and when to have sex and how to protect themselves from pregnancy and disease. For example, the “sugar daddy” phenomenon, in which young women and girls exchange sex with older men for material or financial gain, is common. In addition, gender inequality, high levels of unemployment, persistent poverty, rising crime and violence, population mobility, and the growing commercial sex trade – including sex tourism – compound the country’s vulnerability to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Although Jamaica has a well-established national surveillance system, collecting accurate data about at-risk groups is challenging. Despite some progress in reducing stigma and discrimination (S&D), homosexual behavior continues to be illegal in Jamaica, and many MSM hide their sexual orientation and behavior, impeding accurate health surveys. Recent program estimates indicate that
20 to 30 percent of MSM are HIV-positive. Jamaica also has a large number of mobile sex workers, both Jamaican and from outside of Jamaica, who are difficult to monitor. HIV infection rates among sex workers are much higher than they are in the general population. A 2006 study of female sex workers, reported by UNAIDS, showed an HIV prevalence of 9 percent in this group. However, according to Jamaica’s 2006 UNGASS report, an earlier study found a 20 percent prevalence rate among sex workers in the tourist areas of Montego Bay. The actual prevalence of HIV may be higher in these groups as data collection remains difficult and is limited by sampling methods. Sex workers who were older, less educated, and used crack cocaine were more likely to be HIV-infected. According to UNICEF/Jamaica, in 2003, there were 5,125 children in Jamaica who had lost one or both parents to HIV/AIDS, and thousands more were estimated to have been made vulnerable by the disease. Poverty and neglect have led to a growing number of street and working children. There were 5,143 children in institutional care in 2003, including those in foster care.
Controlling new tuberculosis (TB) infections in Jamaica remains a challenge; the incidence rate is 3 per 100,000 people. However,
according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the prevalence of HIV among Jamaican TB patients is 26 percent. This figure is similar to other developing countries. However, Jamaica has a higher mortality rate among those who are co-infected, so prompt diagnosis of HIV infection and early institution of active antiretroviral treatment (ART) are imperative.
National response.
The Government of Jamaica has aggressively addressed the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 1988, when it established the National HIV/Sexually Transmitted Disease Prevention and Control Program and the National AIDS Committee (NAC), a nongovernmental organization (NGO). The Program, working under the MOH, facilitates governmental cooperation with the private sector and NGOs in the fight against HIV/AIDS. NAC, which has more than 100 member organizations, coordinates the national response to the epidemic.
During the past two decades, Jamaica has taken several steps to combat HIV/AIDS. More recent efforts include joining the Pan Caribbean Partnership Against HIV/AIDS upon its formation in 2001 and continuing to serve as an active member; developing an HIV/AIDS prevention and control project; implementing two national strategic plans on HIV/AIDS and STIs, the most recent of which ended in 2006, and launching a new plan in 2007; providing ART for persons with advanced HIV and HIV-infected mothers since 2004; adopting a national HIV/AIDS policy in 2005; and establishing a private sector-led business coalition on HIV in 2006.
The government recently began implementing its third National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS/STIs, covering 2007 to 2011. The Plan focuses on achieving universal access to prevention, treatment, and care and support. Currently, only 56 percent of HIV-infected people who need treatment receive ART, according to a WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF report. In July 2007, the World Bank announced that it would work with Jamaica to design a second HIV/AIDS prevention and control project to be implemented after the current project closes in May 2008.
In 2004, Jamaica’s MOH received a third-round grant from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to strengthen multisectoral national activities to prevent and address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This has been done through scaling up efforts to:
Jamaica has applied to the Global Fund for a 2007 $44.2 million grant to consolidate existing gains while scaling up efforts to provide universal access to HIV treatment, care, and prevention, with special emphasis on vulnerable populations. Jamaica had already received $16.4 million from the Global Fund during round three for HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention, and policy efforts.

Johann Christian Schickhardt

Johann Christian Schickhardt (c. 1682c. 25 March 1762) was a German composer and woodwind player.
Biography.
Schickhardt was born in Braunschweig (Brunswick) and received his musical education at the Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel court under the patronage of Augustus William, third son and heir of Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. In the first decade of the 18th century, he was employed in the Netherlands and associated with Friedrich of Hesse-Cassel, Henriëtte Amalia van Anhalt-Dessau (daughter of John George II, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau and widow of Henry Casimir II, Prince of Nassau-Dietz) and her son John William Friso, Prince of Orange. In the second decade of the 18th century, Schickhardt lived in Hamburg, where it is speculated by musicologist Andrew D. McCredie that he was a member of the Hamburg Opera in Gänsemarkt as a flutist or oboist. There is evidence suggesting that, in the 1720s, Schickhardt could have been an occasional oboist with the court orchestra of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen, employer of Johann Sebastian Bach. By the 1740s, records place Schickhardt at the University of Leiden as a student, and at his death in 1762, the university described him as "a master of musical arts and a member of the Academy," although there is no surviving record of his musical activity in Leiden otherwise.
Works.
In the first half of the 18th century, numerous works of his, mostly chamber music featuring the treble recorder, appeared in print from publishers Estienne Roger and Le Cène in Amsterdam. At least 30 sets of musical works are known to have been published, some of which are no longer extant. A catalog of Schickhardt's published and manuscript works can be found in David Lasocki's article. With the revival of the treble recorder in the early 20th century, a great interest in suitable repertoire for the instrument developed and some of Schickhardt's works were republished in new editions. It is predominantly through his works for recorder that Schickhardt is known today.
Schickhardt's compositions include sonatas for solo recorder and basso continuo (op. 1 and op. 17) as well as trio sonatas for two recorders and basso continuo (op. 16). Besides these, there are also compositions that stand between the chamber and larger scale concert music styles, e.g., his op. 9 for four recorders and basso continuo and his six sonatas for recorder, two oboes, and basso continuo. Some short works by Schickhardt can also be found in the "The Compleat Tutor to the Hautboy," an oboe tutor published by Walsh and Hare about 1715. Additionally, Schickhardt wrote a recorder concerto in G minor and "L'Alphabet de la musique" (op. 30, c. 1735), which contains sonatas in all 24 keys.

HIV/AIDS in Mexico

Prevalence.
Approximately 220,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS in 2010. The AIDS rate in Mexico is about 0.2% or 193 in 100,000 people.
Transmission vectors.
The AIDS epidemic is concentrated primarily among MSM, sex workers and their clients, and people who inject drugs. Results of a 2006 study by Bravo-Garcia et al. reported by UNAIDS indicate that sex between men accounts for 57 percent of the HIV infections. Mexico’s National Center for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control (CENSIDA) estimates that HIV prevalence among MSM was 10 to 13.5 percent in 2006. Results from studies in 2006 by Gayet et al., Magis et al., and the Biological Behavioral Surveillance Survey conducted in Mexico showed that HIV prevalence rates among male sex workers were 25 percent in Monterrey, 20 percent in Guadalajara and Mexico City, and 12 percent in Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl.
A gradual shift is occurring toward higher rates of infection among both injecting drug users (IDUs) and women, and rates are also rising among female sex workers (FSWs). A 2004–2006 study by Patterson et al. in 2006 showed that HIV prevalence in Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez, cities on the U.S. border, was 6 percent among FSWs and 16 percent among IDUs. Research by Gayet et al. in 2006 also showed that HIV prevalence among male long-distance truck drivers in Monterrey was 0.7 percent (double the estimated national adult HIV prevalence). More than one-quarter of them had paid for sex in the previous year and one-sixth of them had never used a condom. The role of IDUs in Mexico’s epidemic is difficult to determine, but an association with drug use has been observed in cities along the border with the United States, where the spread of HIV through the sharing of drug-injecting equipment is of growing concern.
Population mobility is a factor in HIV/AIDS transmission in Mexico. Cross-border activity, including immigration from Central America and the influx of those returning from migrant work in the United States, has contributed to the spread of the epidemic, particularly in rural parts of the country. Mobile populations are at higher risk of HIV infection because of poverty, violence, lack of access to health services, increased risk-taking behavior, rape, loneliness, and the availability of sex workers.
Although the epidemic in Mexico remains concentrated, it could become generalized due to high-risk behaviors in the general population. There are signs that heterosexual transmission of HIV is increasing as more women are being infected. According to a recent population-based survey by the National Council for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, in 2001, 15 percent of married and cohabitating men reported extrarelational sex during the last year, and only 9 percent of them used a condom at last intercourse. Eighty percent of these men perceived no HIV risk from their behavior. Mexican women are at risk for HIV infection because they often are unable to negotiate condom use. According to published research by Olivarrieta and Sotelo (1996) and others, the prevalence of domestic violence in Mexico varies between 30 and 60 percent. In this context, requesting condom use with a stable partner is perceived as a sign of infidelity and asking to use a condom can result in domestic violence.
HIV infection in Mexico is concentrated in urban areas, where more than 77 percent of the population lives. Most HIV prevention programs focus on urban populations, though there are efforts to reach out to rural, mobile, and indigenous populations. The biggest challenge Mexico currently faces is unequal access to quality care and the need to train health workers and clinics in using antiretroviral treatment (ART).
The spread of HIV/AIDS in Mexico is exacerbated by stigma and discrimination (S&D), which act as a barrier to prevention, testing, and treatment. The 2001 UNGASS declaration stated that “stigma, silence, discrimination and denial, together with lack of confidentiality, weaken the prevention efforts, care and treatment.” S&D occur within families, health services, the police, and the workplace. A study conducted by Infante-Xibille in 2004 of 373 health care providers in three states in Mexico described discrimination within health services. HIV testing was conducted only with perceived high-risk groups, often without informed consent. Patients with AIDS were often isolated. A 2005 five-city participatory community assessment by Colectivo Sol, a nongovernmental organization (NGO), found that some HIV hospital patients had a sign over their beds stating they were HIV-positive. There was also discrimination in the workplace. In León, Guanajuato, researchers found that seven out of 10 people in the study had lost their jobs because of their HIV status. The same study also documented evidence of discrimination that MSM experienced within their families.
The potential for HIV-tuberculosis (TB) co-infection is also a concern in Mexico, as it is in other countries. Studies have shown TB to be the second most frequent infection in AIDS patients in Mexico. It is more prevalent in urban centers among IDUs and individuals of lower socioeconomic status. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the incidence of TB is 10 per 100,000 and 1.1 percent of adults newly diagnosed with TB were found to be HIV-positive in 2006.
National response.
Mexico has a national policy on HIV/AIDS treatment and has made notable gains in providing access to ART for the infected population. Since 2003, Mexico has been providing universal access to ART through the national health system. Although the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF report Towards Universal Access states that 76 percent of HIV-infected people who needed it were receiving ART in December 2006, the government indicates that everyone identified with advanced disease is receiving treatment. Mexico was also successful in securing the blood supply early on, and no cases of HIV have been detected recently through this mode of transmission. CENSIDA has been active since 1988 and collaborates with other government entities as well as with NGOs, including organizations of persons living with HIV/AIDS. This collaboration is a significant asset in the national response to HIV/AIDS, because a coordinated response between government and civil society has proven to be more effective than government entities acting alone.
Mexico established a national network of HIV/AIDS ambulatory health care facilities known as Centros Ambulatorios Para la Prevencion y Atencion en SIDA e ITS (CAPASITS). The CAPASITS are the result of collaboration among local governments, the national government, and NGOs and provide comprehensive community-based attention and treatment free of charge to people with HIV.
In a landmark decision in February 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the military to discharge 11 HIV-positive soldiers and deny them access to military health services. The court ruled that being HIV-positive does not in itself imply an inability to serve in the armed forces and that the military must decide on a case-by-case basis whether or not a soldier can remain in active service. The ruling establishes a precedent allowing dismissed soldiers to seek redress in federal appeals court.

Wolfeton House

Wolfeton House (sometimes Wolveton House) is an early Tudor and Elizabethan manor house in Dorset, England. It is situated amongst water-meadows north-west of Dorchester not far from the confluence of the rivers Frome and Cerne. It is near to the village of Charminster. The compact original courtyard section of the current building dates back to about 1480. Possibly dating back to Roman times, the house has been the country seat of several families, including the Mohuns and Trenchards. The current building is a relic built by the Trenchard family, once being one of the most prominent families in Dorset during the 16th century.
"A Thomas Hardy Dictionary" states this house may have been "The Manor-House of the Drenghards" in Hardy's "The Lady Penelope." 
History.
The Wolfeton estate passed to John Trenchard by marriage in 1480. He and his son, Thomas Trenchard, built a compact courtyard house on the site. In the late-16th century Sir George Trenchard extended the south range and embellished the building. He added the splendid plaster ceilings, fireplaces and panelling dating from around 1580. This was the height of Wolfeton's prosperity; from this period onwards the house's quality began to decline. Wolfeton House was abandoned by Sir George's descendants and it was later sold to cousins in the late 18th century.
By the year 1800 the chapel in the north range was crumbling to the ground, and in 1822 - 28 other parts of the house followed. The property was purchased in 1862 by W H P Weston who repaired the remaining buildings and carried out some modifications. The present-day owner is a relative of the Trenchard family. Since he took ownership of the home in 1973 he has carried out further restoration to the structure.
The entrance to the Wolfeton House is through the medieval Gatehouse that was once connected to north and south areas of the early Tudor house. This went through to the small courtyard of the house.

HIV/AIDS in Nicaragua

Prevalence.
With only 0.2 percent of the adult population estimated to be HIV-positive, Nicaragua has one of the lowest HIV prevalence rates in Central America. HIV was first detected in Nicaragua in 1987, after concentrated epidemics had been reported in other Central American nations. The onset of the epidemic was likely delayed by Nicaragua’s 10-year civil war and the U.S.-led economic blockade, both of which left the country isolated for several years. Relative control over commercial sex work, low infection rates among injecting drug users, and a ban on the commercial sale of blood also slowed HIV transmission. However, the country is at risk of a broader epidemic because of social conditions such as multiple sex partners, gender inequality, and widespread poverty. Many people are unaware of their HIV status and could unwittingly spread the disease. UNAIDS estimates Nicaragua has 7,300 HIV-positive people, nearly half of whom were identified over the past three years.
Sexual activity is the primary mode of HIV transmission in Nicaragua. Unprotected heterosexual intercourse is reported to account for 72 percent of HIV infections, and unprotected sex between men is estimated to account for 26 percent, according to UNAIDS. However, it is likely that the former is over-reported and the latter under-reported because of stigma and discrimination (S&D) against homosexuals. HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) is significantly higher (7.6 percent) than among sex workers or the general population. A 2002 study reported by UNAIDS demonstrated that infection levels among MSM were 38 times higher than among the general population. The latest study on HIV among commercial sex workers reported by UNAIDS demonstrated a prevalence of only 0.2 percent in that group. As of September 2005, more than half of reported HIV cases occurred among 20- to 39-year-olds, according to Nicaragua’s 2006 United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV report.
Factors that put Nicaraguans at risk include early sexual debut; social pressures for males to have multiple sexual partners and take sexual risks; widespread poverty; women’s and girls’ inability to negotiate when and under what circumstances to have sex or use condoms; gender-based violence; and sexual abuse of women and girls. Compounding these factors, access to HIV/AIDS services and information is limited in much of the country due to budgetary priorities and limitations. Moreover, conservative religious and social values make it difficult to talk about sex and ways to protect oneself from disease or unwanted pregnancy.
National response.
Traditionally, HIV/AIDS prevention has not been a national priority in Nicaragua because HIV prevalence is low. The National Program for the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections was not established until 1998. Before that, the Government of Nicaragua enacted the Law for the Promotion, Protection and Defense of Human Rights of People Living With HIV/AIDS (Law 238) in 1996, but the law did not go into effect until 1999. Law 238 created the Nicaraguan AIDS Commission (CONISIDA) in 2000, which is charged with enforcing the law and guiding the national response to HIV/AIDS. However, CONISIDA lacks the organizational and technical capacity to effectively fulfill its role in supporting government and civil society efforts to assist people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and prevent the spread of HIV. Of particular concern is CONISIDA’s failure to adequately ensure the rights of PLWHA. The Country Coordinating Mechanism, formed in 2000, has a variety of prominent members, including representatives from government; multilateral, nongovernmental, and educational organizations; the private sector; religious groups; and representatives of PLWHA. It oversees the HIV/AIDS grant from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Global Fund grant is for more than $10.1 million from 2004 to 2009. The purpose of the grant is to build on the existing national strategic plan for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) by strengthening prevention, care, and support activities; by ensuring comprehensive care for PLWHA; and by documenting all AIDS cases within the national surveillance system.
In 2006, the government approved a new national strategic plan for 2005 to 2009 and a new national AIDS policy. Current efforts focus on increasing the response capacity of the health sector and ensuring the sustainability of measures and actions taken. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has integrated its HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis programs and adopted protocols for treating co-infected patients; however, it has not been able to achieve efficient coordination of the two programs in practice. Nicaragua is also strengthening primary care and implementing awareness, prevention, and protection efforts.
Nicaragua is a partner in the Brazil+7 initiative, a UNICEF-, UNAIDS-, and Brazilian-led effort dedicated to expanding HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care for pregnant women and young people; to offering universal access to antiretroviral medication for PLWHA; and to ensuring universal access to services for preventing mother-to-child transmission. The other partner countries are São Tomé and Príncipe, Bolivia, Paraguay, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, and East Timor.

<doc id="19222837" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19222837" title="Like terms">
Like terms

In algebra, like terms are terms that have the same variables and powers. The coefficients do not need to match.
Unlike terms are two or more terms that are not like terms, i.e. they do not have the same variables or powers. The order of the variables does not matter unless there is a power. For example, 8"xyz"2 and −5"xyz"2 are like terms because they have the same variables and power while 3"abc" and 3"ghi" are unlike terms because they have different variables. Since the coefficient doesn't affect likeness, all constant terms are like terms.
Generalization.
In this discussion, a "term" will refer to a string of numbers being multiplied or divided (remember that division is simply multiplication by a reciprocal) together. Terms are within the same expression and are combined by either addition or subtraction. For example, take the expression:
formula_1
There are two terms in this expression. Notice that the two terms have a common factor, that is, both terms have an formula_2. This means that we can factor out that common factor variable, resulting in
formula_3
If the expression in parentheses may be calculated, that is, if the variables in the expression in the parentheses are known numbers, then it is simpler to write the calculation formula_4. and juxtapose that new number with the remaining unknown number. Terms combined in an expression with a common, unknown factor (or multiple unknown factors) are called like terms.
Examples.
General Example.
To provide an example for above, let formula_5 and formula_6 have arbitrary values, so that their sum may be calculated. For ease of calculation, let formula_7 and formula_8. The original expression becomes
formula_9
which may be factored into
formula_10
or, equally,
formula_11.
This demonstrates that
formula_12
The known values assigned to the unlike part of two or more terms are called coefficients. As this example shows, when like terms exist in an expression, they may be combined by adding or subtracting (whatever the expression indicates) the coefficients, and maintaining the common factor of both terms. Such combination is called combining like terms, and it is an important tool used for solving equations.
Simplifying An Expression.
Take the expression, which is to be simplified:
formula_13
The first step to grouping like terms in this expression is to get rid of the parentheses. Do this by distributing (multiplying) each number in front of a set of parentheses to each term in that set of parentheses:
formula_14
The like terms in this expression are the terms that can be grouped together by having exactly the same set of unknown factors. Here, the sets of unknown factors are formula_15 formula_16 and formula_17. By the rule in the first example, all terms with the same set of unknown factors, that is, all like terms, may be combined by adding or subtracting their coefficients, while maintaining the unknown factors. Thus, the expression becomes
formula_18
The expression is considered simplified when all like terms have been combined, and all terms present are unlike. In this case, all terms now have different unknown factors, and are thus unlike, and so the expression is completely simplified.

Bremanger Church

Bremanger Church () is a parish church in Bremanger Municipality in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway. It is located in the village of Bremanger on the island of Bremangerlandet. The church is part of the Bremanger parish in the Nordfjord deanery in the Diocese of Bjørgvin.
The wooden "long church" was built in 1914, and it was originally called "Bremangerpollen Chapel". The name was changed to "Bremanger Church" in 1952. The church is located at Hauge, in the innermost part of the Bremangerpollen bay in the municipality of Bremanger. The church, with a seating capacity of 400, was consecrated on 4 September 1914 by the bishop Johan Willoch Erichsen. The architect Anders Karlsen Eid made the designs.
History.
Historically, there was a church at Grotle, just west of the village of Bremanger. In 1865, the aging church at Grotle was torn down and the people living in the northern part Bremangerlandet island were without a church of their own. The nearest church was Frøya Church to the south, on the island of Frøya. The people who lived further north on the island complained that the journey to that church had become too long and strenuous. Going by boat around Novene was often a risky undertaking, which kept people from going to church. The people felt that if they got a church in their own village, many more people would get the opportunity to listen to the words of the Lord. These people, even the Vicar, had to eventually yield to such a strong argument, and so the work was started in the 1890s to erect a new church in the village of Hauge (now called Bremanger).
So, the new church was built at Hauge and all of the farms between Vetvik (in the north) and Nøtset (in the south) were transferred to the new Bremangerpollen parish that was established on 1 July 1908 and a few days later a ""bedehus"" (chapel) was consecrated for church functions. From the village of Vetvik the journey to church was still more than long enough, and for those who chose not to go by boat, the alternative was a three-hour hike across the mountain.
A new church was completed in 1914 to replace the little chapel that was originally used from 1908 until 1914. The stones for the foundation wall were taken from the mountain straight up from the church site. This work was carried out on a voluntary basis by the villagers themselves, in addition to the transportation of the wooden building material.

George Rennie Thorne

George Rennie Thorne (12 October 1853 – 20 February 1934) was a British solicitor and politician.
Family and education.
Thorne was educated at Tettenhall College, Wolverhampton and became a solicitor in 1876 . In 1886 he married Susan Mary Jones and they had two daughters. He went on to become senior member of the law form G R Thorne & Sons of Wolverhampton and London.
Local politics.
Thorne entered local politics in Wolverhampton being a Borough Councillor for many years and later an Alderman. He was Mayor of Wolverhampton in 1902-03 and Chairman of South Staffordshire Joint Smallpox Hospital from its formation. He also served as a Justice of the Peace.
Wolverhampton East by-election, 1908.
Thorne had stood unsuccessfully for election twice in the South and West divisions of Wolverhampton before getting elected in 1908 at by-election on 5 May to succeed Sir Henry Fowler who had been made a peer. 
In nearly every way Thorne seemed the stereotypical Liberal of his day; a pronounced nonconformist, a Baptist, in a constituency where there were many nonconformist voters. In his election meetings and literature he declared himself a supporter of Free Trade, the proposed Bill on Old Age Pensions, restricting to eight the hours that miners could be made to work daily, women’s suffrage, Irish Home Rule and any necessary reform of the House of Lords. He was also strongly in favour of temperance and a supporter of the disestablishment of the Church of England.
Thorne won the by-election by a majority of just eight votes from the Unionist candidate Leo Amery. One of reasons it was such a narrow margin was the policy of the Suffragettes at this time to oppose the candidates of the Liberal government because they would not bring in a Bill to provide votes for women. This was despite the individual views of the candidates, many of whom, like Thorne, were pro-women’s suffrage. Interestingly in this election, a Mrs Lois Dawson, who had incorrectly been placed on the electoral register as Louis Dawson, was allowed to vote by a very surprised polling station presiding officer, as she was clearly on the electoral roll. Her vote was allowed to stand, although had there been a court scrutiny of the election result it would almost certainly have been rejected.
Member of Parliament.
Thorne held his seat at every general election after the by-election before announcing he would stand down in 1929. In 1919 he was appointed joint Chief Whip of the Independent Liberals led by H H Asquith and held the post until 1923. In that year he was the Vice-Chairman of Liberal Parliamentary Party.

New York's 26th congressional district election, 2008

New York's 26th district general election of 2008 was held on November 4, 2008. Republican businessman Christopher J. Lee (R) won the seat running against Democratic lawyer Alice Kryzan (148,607 to 109,615), despite the fact that several analysts rated the race as a toss up or leaning Democratic.
Republican Nomination.
Republican Chris Lee was the only candidate running for the party nomination and was endorsed by incumbent Representative Tom Reynolds.
Operatives within the party also reportedly tried to recruit several other high-profile candidates, including WIVB-TV anchor Don Postles, a registered independent, which led to Postles having to issue an on-air rejection of their efforts.
Democratic Nomination.
Alice Kryzan, an environmental attorney, won the Democratic party primary election on Tuesday, September 9th, 2008. She ran against Jon Powers, an Iraq war vet and the endorsed Democratic candidate, as well as wealthy industrialist Jack Davis. The primary was notable for its large negative ad content, most heavily by self-financed Davis against Powers. Kryzan upset the conventional wisdom with a surprise win, partially on the strength of a last-minute TV ad characterizing the other two candidates as squabbling. A major selling point Kryzan used was that both of her primary rivals were former Republicans.
Powers remained on the Working Families Party ballot line despite endorsing Kryzan and attempting to get himself removed after having moved out of state. The Republican party brought a lawsuit to prevent the line from being given to Kryzan. However, the presence of Powers on the ballot made no difference to the outcome of the race as the number of votes his ballot line received was much smaller than the margin of victory for Lee.

Geon (video game)

Geon is a multiplayer-oriented action arcade video game developed by independent software developer Strawdog Studios. The initial version of the game was originally released as "" for the Xbox 360's XBLA service in September 2007.
The title has since been updated, improved and was released on 25 September 2008 via the PlayStation 3's PlayStation Store. The Wii version of the game was released on October 27, 2009.
Gameplay.
"Geon" is a fast-paced arcade game that requires players to take control of an emotion-themed cube and direct it around a semi-transparent pellet covered grid. The cube collects the pellets and the aim of the game is to fill the cube with pellets and then deposit them in your opponent's goal. Scoring five 'goals' against your opponent (either human or computer controlled) wins the game.
Each grid has two sides, and the game begins with players being placed on opposite sides of the grid (not opposite ends). Players are not restricted to their 'home' side, and may traverse to the edge of the grid to 'flip' over to their opponents side at any time.
In order to score a goal, each cube must first be 'charged' with energy. This is achieved by collecting small pellets of energy that are distributed over each grid in a manner similar to Pac-Man. Once charged, the player is unable to collect further pellets and must attempt to score a goal by landing on the central goal area on their opponents side of the grid. (Players cannot collect their opponents pellets.)
In order to gain an advantage in the competition, players can collect and deploy 'powerballs' that are available on the grids. The powerball available will depend on which emotion the player selected to play with. In addition to these emotion specific powerballs the Geon cube has a shield and a jump attack, which can be used to disrupt your opponents collecting. Note: The shield and attack are new to Geon and were not in the original "" released for XBLA.
Singleplayer mode features two modes: Duel, where the player faces an AI opponent, and Time Attack where grids are played in sequence and the player must beat the computer and win the game within a target time to win awards and unlock mini-games.
The game features split-screen and Xbox-Live or PlayStation Network-based multiplayer gameplay which allows players to play against one another in the Duel mode, or one of the two multiplayer-exclusive modes: Team Geon, where two teams of two players play against each other in a 4-way split-screen match. The Last Man Standing mode pits four players against each other to score goals. In each round, the last player to score a goal is eliminated.
Emotions.
The game is based around a central theme of eight select emotions, each of which have an associated avatar, music track, and powerball advantage. Players must choose an emotion before each game is played. Each emotion corresponds to a powerball; picking up and using the corresponding powerball gives a stronger effect.
Grids.
The game contains 32 unique 2-player grids, that reveal a variety of obstacles like loops, bounce pads, lifts, platforms and switches.
There are an additional four grids specifically for 4-player games.

Rugsund Church

Rugsund Church () is a parish church in Bremanger Municipality in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway. It is located in the village of Rugsund, on the southern coast of the Nordfjorden. The church is part of the Rugsund parish in the Nordfjord deanery in the Diocese of Bjørgvin.
Rugsund Church is located on the Hessevågen farm on the mainland side of the village of Rugsund. The church has a seating capacity of 400, and was consecrated on 2 September 1838. The church is a wooden "long church". It was built using plans by the architect Hans Linstow. The church building was remodeled in 1912.
History.
There has been a church in Rugsund (on the island of Rugsundøya) since the 13th century. The first church was a stave church that was replaced in 1650. The present church building was constructed in 1838 after the previous one burned down. The church in Rugsund has a long history, but the church carrying this name today was erected at a different site than the earlier Rugsund churches. When the former church burned down, it had for a long time been a problem that the graveyard at Rugsundøya had such a shallow layer of soil. This was an important reason why a new graveyard and church site was moved to the mainland. As a matter of fact, the soil conditions were so bad at the earlier church site that funeral parties transported masses of soil by boat to the graveyard.
The beautiful location of the previous church on the point above the harbour was a navigational landmark for ships. When the present church was to be built, people demanded a similarly beautiful location. At Rugsund, the church was centrally located with the main entrance facing the sea, and with an excellent view from the church steps across the sound to the island. The churchyard encircles the church, and furthest down to the sea, there is a stately gate that the seafarers in earlier times walked through on their way to church. This was also the place where the vicar went ashore when he came by boat from Davik.

<doc id="19223124" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19223124" title="Waldemar Wübke">
Waldemar Wübke

Waldemar Wübke was a "Luftwaffe" fighter pilot during World War II. 
He was one of the few "Luftwaffe" fighter pilots to survive combat duty over the entire course of the war. Wübke flew various types of German fighters in combat and was credited with a total of 15 victories over Allied aircraft.
In 1940 as a "Leutnant", Wübke flew sorties with pilots of the 9. "Staffel", III./Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG 54) during the Battle of Britain. His last combat flights were made in 1945 flying ""Platzschutz"" or airfield defense missions for General Adolf Galland's Me 262 jet squadron, Jagdverband 44 (JV 44). 
Along with a handful of experienced fighter pilots, the now "Hauptmann" Wübke flew the outstanding piston-engined Fw190D-9 fighter in an effort to protect the jets of JV 44 from attack by Allied fighters during take-off. Their unit was based close to the jets at München-Riem, Germany.
Since the airfield at München-Reim was heavily protected from Allied aircraft by flak batteries, the Fw 190Ds of the Würger-Staffel had to be made instantly recognizable as ‘friendlies’ to the flak battery crews. To facilitate this, the under surfaces of many of the airfield defense fighters were painted bright red with white stripes. 
JV 44's unofficial unit crest was a white circle trimmed with red, with a black and white checker board in the middle, and most of the Fw190Ds used in this unit wore this emblem. Hauptmann Waldemar Wübke regularly flew the Fw190D-9 coded “Rot 3” (Red 3). Wübke painted his personal emblem on the port side of the fuselage under the cockpit of his aircraft; the words “"Im Auftrage der Reichsbahn"” ("In service of the Reich Railway") in white lettering. This was a sarcastic reference to Wübke's loathing of fighter-bomber missions, many of which he was forced to undertake in his early career as a combat pilot. In his opinion trains were better used to carry bombs, not fighter aircraft.
The ability and success of Wübke and his fellow ‘Würger-Staffel’ pilots is evidenced by the fact that very few Me 262s of JV 44 were destroyed on takeoff, and most that were pounced on by Allied fighters were destroyed on landing at various other landing strips.
Wübke died in a plane crash in South America in the early 1950s.

USS Beaufort (PCS-1387)

USS "Beaufort" (PCS-1387) – initially known as USS "PCS-1387" -- was a "PCS-1376"-class submarine chaser acquired by the U.S. Navy during World War II. Although constructed and designed as an anti-submarine patrol ship, she was used throughout the war, and afterwards, as a training ship for sonar operators.
Built at Whitestone, New York.
The fourth ship to be so named by the Navy, "Beaufort" (PCS-1387) was laid down on 22 May 1943 at Whitestone, New York; launched on 10 October 1944 as simply "PCS-1387"; sponsored by Miss Barbara C. Dietz; and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 27 November 1944, Lt. (jg.) Anthony C. Kupris, USNR, in command.
World War II service.
After fitting out, the subchaser embarked upon her shakedown cruise on 15 December. She conducted that training out of Key West, Florida, between 22 December 1944 and 2 January 1945. 
On the latter day, "PCS-1387" began duty with the Fleet Sonar School, Key West, Florida, as a training platform for new sonarmen. She also doubled as harbor guard ship at Key West. Such training duties continued past the end of the war, through the late 1940s, and into the 1950s. 
The 1950s, however, brought an increase in the extent of her zone of operations for, after that time, she ranged the Atlantic Ocean coast as far north as Narragansett Bay and south into the Caribbean. On 15 February 1956, she was named "Beaufort". Just over a month later on 26 March, "Beaufort" was decommissioned at St. Petersburg, Florida.
Continued duty as a training ship.
Her usefulness to the Navy, however, did not end there. She was retained in service for another 11 years under the Commandant, 6th Naval District, as a training ship for naval reservists.
Designated as a target ship.
On 15 July 1967, her name was struck from the Navy List, and she was turned over to the Naval Weapons Laboratory, Dahlgren, Virginia, for use as a target. Apparently, she was not totally destroyed because she was sold in July 1972 to Mr. David Hahn of Belize, British Honduras.

Bertrand Castelli

Bertrand Castelli (December 3, 1929, Salon-de-Provence – August 1, 2008) was a French producer, director, lighting designer, choreographer, painter and writer best known as the executive producer of many productions of the rock musical "Hair" in partnership with the show's main producer Michael Butler. Castelli was instrumental in helping the show reach Broadway and would later lead the effort to introduce "Hair" to a worldwide theatre audience.
Beginning as an innovative lighting designer for ballet and opera, Castelli tried screenwriting, playwriting, choreographing and directing before becoming a producer of "Hair" in New York and then masterminding its many international productions. In later years, he became the artist in residence of a Mexican resort, where he created paintings for every room in the resort.
Biography.
Castelli was born in Salon-de-Provence, Bouches-du-Rhône, France, of Corsican heritage. During World War II, he got a job operating the projector at a cinema. Castelli and his friends began to paint and to write and perform plays, operas and ballets to cast aside the gloom of Nazi-occupied Paris. At the age of 17, after the war, he toured Germany operating the lights for a small circus, learning theatre arts and developing innovative lighting techniques.
Early career.
Castelli began his professional artistic career in France working for ballet and opera companies in Paris, starting with lighting design. To finance his ambitions to create a serious ballet, at the age of 21 he first created a short ballet called "Le Coleur de Fische" in which he costumed dancers as large advertising posters, which came to life advertising each product through a three-minute solo. He boldly pitched the unique concept to large companies such as Perrier, Cartier, Christian Dior and Cointreau. The companies were intrigued and provided financing. He then was able to stage a first-class production of his ballet "Les Algues", composed by Guy Bernard, and hired the ballerina Janine Charrat to choreograph and dance the lead role. The ballet earned him considerable success and gave him an "entrée to the society of artists" that, at the time, included Louis-Ferdinand Céline and Jean-Paul Sartre. He traveled in Paris art circles and rubbed elbows with Pablo Picasso, Marcel Marceau and Jean Cocteau. According to his daughter, he once worked as Picasso's assistant, and he was an occasional lover of Françoise Gilot, the mother of two of Picasso's children. For the next few years, he created, produced and directed works for Les Ballets Africaines, Champs Elysees Theatre and the Marquis de Cuevas Ballet Company. Other ballets that he worked on were "Face To Face" and "Green Light, Red Light". 
At the age of 24, he moved to New York and then on to Hollywood, where MGM offered him a contract. He wrote numerous plays, including "The Umbrella" which was produced both on Broadway and in London, "The Men's Room" and "A Frenchman in New York", the last of which was turned into a film. He also wrote screenplays, episodes of television shows including "The Millionaire", and a musical comedy together with Ogden Nash and Vernon Duke. He also choreographed striptease vignettes for The Body Shop, the famous club on Sunset Boulevard. In Hollywood, he befriended people like Gene Kelly, Igor Stravinsky, Aldous Huxley, Dorothy Parker and Ray Bradbury. Among other things, he had a role in the 1959 film "Thunder in the Sun", a western starring Susan Hayward. Mr. Castelli’s marriage to Lorees Yerby, who was a co-director of “Richard,” ended in divorce. In addition to Pandora, who lives in Manhattan, he is survived by another daughter, Josephine, also of Manhattan; a granddaughter; and two stepsons, Michael and Winston Dutton.
"Hair" and later career.
At the time "Hair" opened off-Broadway in 1967, Castelli was the director of the Harkness Ballet Company, where he incorporated experimental ideas from Andy Warhol and eventual "Hair" director Tom O'Horgan. When the "Hair" team was unable to find a Broadway theater owner that would accept the controversial show, Castelli met with Michael Butler's father Paul and convinced him to use his considerable political clout to make the Biltmore Theater available. Shortly after "Hair" opened on Broadway in 1968, Butler gave Castelli the job of leading the many foreign language productions of the show. Castelli made the decision to translate "Hair" into the local language of each country at a time when Broadway shows were always done in English. He produced and sometimes directed companies in France, Germany, Mexico and several other countries, unearthing local and international talent such as Donna Summer and the French singer Julien Clerc. 
After "Hair", Castelli returned to producing ballet, opera and musical comedy for a decade. In 1972, he wrote and produced "Richard," a pre-Watergate lampoon of President Richard M. Nixon, starring John Carradine, Vivian Blaine and Mickey Rooney. He also invented a game similar to table-tennis called "Plaff", for which he invented a paddle with two parallel surfaces connected by a hand grip. He married and later divorced Lorees Yerby, who was a co-director of "Richard". They had two daughters, Pandora and Josephine. 
During the last 15 years of his life, Castelli lived mostly in the Yucatán, Mexico, where he was artist in residence at the Maroma Resort and Spa in Riviera Maya, not far from Cancún. He spent his retirement writing and painting abstract, Spanish-influenced, colorful artworks whose subject was often dancers and human movement, surrounded in retirement by his artistic young friends. He created a painting for every room in the resort. "The New York Times" described him as "a friend of the famous and not-so-famous, a cultivator of people, an avid pot smoker and devoted sensualist". His friend Michael Butler described him as a "crazy showman... the guy with the business suit and beads". 
Castelli died at the age of 78 in a hospital near the resort after being hit by a speedboat during his daily swim.

Henri Romans-Petit

Henri Romans-Petit (1897–1980) was a member of the French Resistance during the Second World War. He organised several maquis, notably the maquis de l'Ain et du Haut-Jura and the maquis de Haute-Savoie.
Biography.
Romans-Petit was born on the 13 February 1897 at Firminy in the Loire département. He was mobilized in 1938. After the armistice, he failed in his attempt to join Free France in London. At Saint-Étienne, he connected with the "L'Espoir" network affiliated to Franc-Tireur. He was involved in preparing areas for parachute drops around Lyon.
In 1942 Romans-Petit organised the maquis de l'Ain et du Haut-Jura, and on 11 November he marched in the town of Oyonnax at the head of his maquisards. This fact was said to have decided the English and French forces in London to send arms drops to the French maquisards who were in desperate need of them.
Romans-Petit was involved in starting maquis in Haute-Savoie, before he passed over his responsibilities to Tom Morel so that he could dedicate himself completely to the Maquis de L'Ain. Over the summer of 1944 Romans-Petit set up a full civil administration at Nantua, and brought "La voix du maquis" into being. On the liberation of France, he was imprisoned for several weeks at Fort Lamothe at Lyon by the new commissaire de la République, Yves Farge.
Romans-Petit died on the 1 November 1980 at Ceignes in the Ain département.

Grossaktion Warsaw (1942)

The Grossaktion or Gross-Aktion (Large Action) in Warsaw () was a Nazi German operation of mass extermination of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto beginning July 22, 1942. It was a key part of the countrywide Operation Reinhard headed by the SS- und Polizeiführer Odilo Globocnik. The Nazi forces conducted most of the mass deportations of the inhabitants of the Ghetto from "Umschlagplatz" of the Warsaw Ghetto (collection points) to the Treblinka extermination camp between "Tisha B'Av" (July 23) and "Yom Kippur" (September 21) of 1942. The "Grossaktion" (German for large-scale operation) was directed by SS- und Polizeiführer Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg, the commander of the Warsaw area since 1941. He was relieved of duty by Heinrich Himmler on April 17, 1943 and replaced with SS- und Polizeiführer Jürgen Stroop. Stroop took over from von Sammern-Frankenegg because of his unsuccessful offensive against the Ghetto. 
The turning point in the life of the Ghetto was April 18, 1942, marked by a new wave of mass executions by the SS. 
"Until that day, no matter how difficult life had been, the ghetto inhabitants felt that their everyday life, the very foundations of their existence, were based on something stabilized and durable... On April 18th the very basis of ghetto life started to move from under people's feet... By now everybody understood that the ghetto was to be liquidated, but nobody yet realized that its entire population was destined to die." — Marek Edelman
The "deportations".
On July 22, 1942, the German SS headed by the "Resettlement Commissioner", Sturmbannführer Hermann Höfle called a meeting of the Ghetto Jewish Council Judenrat and informed its leader Adam Czerniaków about the "resettlement to the East". Czerniakow, who committed suicide after learning of the plan, was replaced by Marc Lichtenbaum. The population of the Ghetto was not informed about the real state of affairs and only by the end of 1942 did it became clear to them that the deportations, overseen by the Jewish Ghetto Police designated to supervise them, were to the Treblinka death camp and not for the purpose of resettlement. 
During the two months of summer 1942, about 254,000 Ghetto residents were sent to Treblinka and exterminated there (or at least 300,000 by different accounts, possibly, with the inclusion of the Ghetto falling considered by many a part of the operation). The sheer death-toll among the Jewish inhabitants of the Ghetto during the Gross-aktion would have been difficult to compare even with the liquidation of the Ghetto in spring of next year during and after the Ghetto Uprising which meant annihilation of around 50,000 people. The Gross Aktion resulted in the death of five times as many victims. It is fair to assume then, that it was not the actual razing of the ghetto that resulted in the destruction of the Jewish population of Warsaw, but mainly the operation of a previous summer. 
For eight weeks the rail shipments of Jews to Treblinka went on without stopping: 100 people to a cattle truck, 5,000 to 6,000 each and every day including hospital patients and orphanage children. Dr Janusz Korczak, a famed educator went with them in August 1942. He was offered a chance to escape from the deportations by Polish friends and admirers, but he chose instead to share the fate of his life's work. On arrival at Treblinka, stripped victims were marched to one of ten chambers disguised as showers, and suffocated to death in batches of 200 with the use of monoxide gas (Zyklon B was introduced at Auschwitz some time later). In September 1942, new gas chambers were built, which could kill as many as 3,000 people in just 2 hours. Civilians were forbidden to approach the area. 
Many of the remaining Jews decided to fight, and many of them were helped by the Polish underground. The Jewish Combat Organization (ŻOB, ) was formed in October 1942 and tasked with resisting any future deportations. It was led by 24 year–old Mordechai Anielewicz. Meanwhile, the Polish Home Army, Armia Krajowa, began to smuggle weapons, ammunition and supplies into the Ghetto for the uprising. 
Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg was court-martialed by Himmler on April 24, 1943 for his ineptitude, and sent to Croatia where he died in a partisan ambush. Jürgen Stroop was awarded the Iron Cross First Class by the supreme commander of the Wehrmacht, Field Marshal General Wilhelm Keitel for his "murder expedition" (Alfred Jodl) and after the war, was placed on trial by the Americans and sentenced to death. His execution was not carried out; instead, he was handed over to the Polish authorities for re-trial. He was again sentenced to death in Poland and executed on the scene of his crime on September 8, 1951.

Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway

The Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway is a National Scenic Byway in the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota, USA. It is a loop which is composed of portions of U.S. Route 16A, South Dakota Highway 244, South Dakota Highway 87, and South Dakota Highway 89. Parts of the byway enter Black Hills National Forest, Custer State Park and the Mt. Rushmore National Memorial; the byway also passes within five miles (8 km) of the Crazy Horse Memorial. The byway is named after Peter Norbeck, who served as governor of and senator for South Dakota.
Route description.
The Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway consists of a loop made up of four numbered highways. The byway is part of US 16A, the Iron Mountain Road, south of Keystone. This portion of the highway includes several tunnels and pigtail bridges. The byway enters Custer State Park along its eastern edge and turns west at its intersection with SD 36. In the western part of the state park, the byway splits into two highways, one which follows US 16A westward and one which follows SD 87 northward. The US 16A portion of the byway runs into Custer, where the byway becomes part of SD 89 and heads north. This portion of the byway meets the SD 87 portion in the northwest corner of Custer State Park. The byway then follows SD 87 to its intersection with US 16 and US 385, where it becomes part of the nearby SD 244. The byway follows SD 244 westward into the Mount Rushmore National Memorial, where it meets up with US 16A.
History.
Most of the roads which make up the Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway were proposed by Peter Norbeck when he was a U.S. Senator. Norbeck's first major proposal was the Needles Highway, which comprises the SD 87 portion of the byway and cuts through the Needles. Though engineers of the time said a highway could not be built in the Needles, the highway still came into existence. Norbeck also proposed the Iron Mountain Road, the US 16A section of the byway. The byway was established on September 23, 1996, and named in honor of Norbeck.

Ålfoten Church

Ålfoten Church () is a parish church in Bremanger Municipality in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway. It is located in the village of Ålfoten, very close to the shore of the Ålfotfjorden. The church is part of the Ålfoten parish in the Nordfjord deanery in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The cog-joint wooden "long church" was built in the 17th century to replace an older church. 
Ålfoten Church, which can seat 100 people, was built in the 17th century. The present church was built on or near the site of a 13th-century stave church. For a long time, the year 1678 was believed to be the year of the construction, but it probably dates from about 1610. This church is the oldest wooden church still standing in the Nordfjord region of Norway. It is a small, modest church with a small stone wall around the churchyard. The interior is almost all unpainted. The interior was restored in the late 1970s.

Scott Bundgaard

Scott Bundgaard is a Republican politician who served in the Arizona legislature. He served as the majority leader of the Arizona State Senate from January 10, 2011 until his ouster on March 15, 2011 by a vote of the Senate Republican caucus due to a personal scandal. On January 6, 2012 he abruptly resigned from the Senate just before he was to testify before the Ethics Committee investigating charges of his personal and official misconduct.
Bundgaard had previously served in the Arizona State Senate for six years (1997–2003) and Arizona House of Representatives for two years (1995-1997). In 2000 Bundgaard was a prime sponsor of Senate Bill 1220 which created the Arizona Sports and Tourism Authority to build taxpayer-funded stadiums for National Football League and major league baseball teams.
While serving in the Senate, Bundgaard worked on matters of fiscal policy by cutting taxes and cutting spending, working to eliminate affirmative action programs, working to end dependence on foreign fuels by promoting renewable energy, working to protect the public from unsafe products and financial scams. He worked toward ending restrictions by public schools against student-led Bible clubs, and putting pressure on HOAs who worked to prevent members from flying the American flag
He ran unsuccessfully in 2002 for the Republican nomination for the United States House of Representatives in Arizona's second congressional district, receiving only 16.1% of the vote. He returned to the state senate in 2011 after winning election to the open District 4 Senate seat.
Controversies.
On the evening of February 25, 2011 police responded to a call regarding a man, later identified as Bundgaard, pulling a woman out of a car in Phoenix Arizona. Both Bundgaard and his girlfriend showed marks of a physical altercation. Both were taken into custody but only his girlfriend was arrested because Bundgaard stated he had legislative immunity from arrest while legislature is in session. Members of the legislature are not allowed to be arrested except for treason, felony, and breaches of the peace, and they shall not be subject to any civil process during the session of the legislature, nor for fifteen days next before the commencement of each session. On June 10, 2011 he was served with a summons and complaint for assault (ARS 13-1203A), endangerment (ARS 13-1201A), and domestic violence (ARS 13-3601A).
At Senator Bundgaard's Initial Appearance in Phoenix City Court, the prosecution asked his attorney if they would agree to meet and discuss a possible plea bargain. On August 16, 2011, after lengthy negotiations between both the Senator's attorneys and prosecutors, he pled no contest and agreed to participate in domestic violence classes for six months. He was ordered to pay his victim $1,336.99 in criminal restitution. A "no contest" plea is treated by the courts like a guilty plea.
He was the prime sponsor of SB 1412 in 2000, a controversial alternative fuels program that cost the Arizona taxpayers over $100 million. As a legislator he tried to take advantage of the program by buying five vehicles at government expense.
In 1999 he was investigated for improper interference with local authorities on behalf of an industrial environmental polluter.
He was fined $3,500 by the Federal Elections Commission for improper campaign finance reporting during the 2002 congressional campaign.
Scott Bundgaard has a long history of civil and criminal litigation. In the 1986 he was convicted of burglary. After he had served his sentence his felony conviction was "expunged." In 2003 he was sued by a client for mishandling funds and subsequently surrendered his securities license.
In 2006 he was married in a covenant marriage but his wife had to call the police during the honeymoon. She had the union annulled shortly thereafter citing threats and domestic violence as reasons.
In September 2011 Mr. Bundgaard filed ethics complaints against members of the Senate Ethics Committee who had voted to investigate him for ethics violations. Interim committee members were appointed and the charges against the original committee members were investigated and dismissed. Shortly thereafter Mr. Bundgaard's attorney's withdrew from his case having not received payment for any billings since Mr. Bundgaard first engaged them. His legal bill for his criminal case is believed to be nearly one hundred thousand dollars.
In December 2012 Bundgaard filed a $10,000,000 lawsuit against the City of Phoenix alleging that three police officers, the mayor of Phoenix, the chief of police, five civilian witnesses and the victim of his domestic violence attack conspired to defame his character. The case was transferred to federal district court where it was summarily dismissed.

Thomas Weyland

Sir Thomas Weyland (1230 – January 1298) was a British justice. He was the third son of Herbert Weyland and his wife Beatrice; his three brothers, John, Richard and William, also pursued administrative and judicial careers. Thomas's first appearance in official records is in 1251 as an attorney for his brother John for the making of a final concord. In 1258 he paid 100 marks for the Manor of Chillesford in Suffolk, and purchased a second manor in 1258 at Blaxhall for 300 marks; it is unknown what career he had to earn such money. In 1266 he married Anna, daughter of Richard de Coleville, and was knighted in 1270. In 1274 he was made a justice of the Common Bench after the death of his older brother William, who had previously held such a position. 
He served as a junior justice for four years, and was appointed Chief Justice in 1278 after the retirement of Roger of Seaton. He held office for 11 years until his removal from office 1289, and his time in this position is the first period of which substantial law reports survive. The reports present a mixed view; while they show he was in possession of a clear and sharp legal mind, often deciding litigation cases of the court either on his own or with his colleague William of Brompton, he was also involved in several instances of corruption and misconduct, including editing his plea roll in a land litigation case involving one of his relatives, being rewarded by an interest in the property in question. Many of these cases only turned up after his removal from office, and although some were shown to be false many were not. During this time he made large acquisitions of property, including seven manors in Suffolk, three in Essex and several others elsewhere. He spent an average of £150 a year on property acquisition while in office, and while much money may have come from the profits of his estate or the income from his wife's dower lands, his relative lack of scruples makes it likely some came from judicial corruption.
His removal from office in 1289 was not, however, as a result of judicial misconduct. On 20 July 1289 two of his servants committed a murder at a village fair, killing William Carwel, an Irish servant of the Earl of Norfolk. The killing may have been as a result of a drunken brawl, but it is probable it was part of bitter factional fighting between followers of the Earl, of which Weyland was one of his leading councillors. After they returned to his house at Monewden he failed to have them arrested, despite knowing of the murder, therefore becoming an accessory. Due to the Earl's desire to have the matter dealt with a warrant was issued for a court of enquiry on 4 September and the men were executed on 14 September. The jurors in the matter also indicted the Chief Justice for harbouring the killers, and orders were given for his arrest. A clerk of the High Sheriff of Suffolk was sent to capture him, but soon after his arrest he escaped under cover of darkness. He made his way to the Franciscan priory at Babwell, where he took the orders habit. After his location became known, Edward I sent orders to Robert Malet to starve him out. Thomas surrendered in 1290, most likely in return for safe travel to the Tower of London, where he was offered a choice between standing trial, perpetual imprisonment, and exile, of which he chose exile. On 20 February he took an oath not to return to any English territory, including Ireland, and was given nine days to reach Dover, his port of departure. By 1292 he had settled in Paris, and was pardoned by the king in 1297 and allowed to return home, where he died in 1298.

Julia Smith (composer)

Julia Frances Smith ( January 25, 1905 – April 18, 1989) was an American composer, pianist, and author on musicology.
Life and career.
She was born in Denton, Texas. She graduated from University of North Texas College of Music (1930) and then continued with graduate studies in piano and composition at the Juilliard School from 1932 to 1939, earning a diploma. She simultaneously studied at New York University earning a Masters degree in 1933 and a PhD in 1952. From 1932 to 1939 she served as pianist for the Orchestrette Classique of New York, a women’s orchestra. During this time she also gave concerts of mostly American music in Latin America, Europe, and throughout the United States. As a performer she became particularly associated with the works of Aaron Copland. From 1941 to 1946 she taught at the Hartt School, where she founded the department of music education.
As a composer Smith is best known for her operas and orchestral works, which have all been performed. Her music incorporates elements of jazz, folk music and 20th-century French harmony. Her compositional style has an appealing directness and although tonal, makes interesting use of dissonance. Among her best works are "The String Quartet", which uses irregular metres and driving rhythms; and the operas "Cynthia Parker" and "Cockcrow", which employ folk music within a generally conservative tonal idiom. 
Smith was the recipient of several commissions and awards and was active in several music organizations, especially the National Federation of Music Clubs, for which she chaired the Decade of Women Committee (1970–79). As a writer her publications include "Aaron Copland: his Work and Contribution to American Music" (New York, 1955) and a "Directory of American Women Composers" (Chicago, 1970), of which she was the editor.
She died in New York City.
Family.
On April 23, 1938, Julia Smith married Oscar Albert Vielehr (b. Aug. 4, 1892, Rochester, NY; d. Nov 30, 1975, New York, NY). In private life, she was known as Mrs. Oscar A. Vielehr. Oscar was an engineer and inventor and wholeheartedly supported his wife's career as a composer. A native New Yorker, he was employed at the Gyroscope Company, an Army ordnance plant. They had met at a concert.

Bruce Henricksen

Bruce Henricksen (born 1941), American author, scholar, and editor, grew up in the town of Wanamingo, Minnesota and the city of Minneapolis.
Life.
He graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1963 with a degree in English, having studied under poets Allen Tate and James Wright. In 1970, he received a Ph.D. from the University of California and began a career at Loyola University New Orleans, where he chaired the English Department and edited "New Orleans Review." While at Loyola, he received an NEH summer fellowship to Princeton University and was a participant in the Institute of Medieval and Renaissance Studies at Duke University and in The School of Criticism and Theory at Northwestern University.
As one of three editors of "New Orleans Review" (including poet John Biguenet and fellow English professor John Mosier), Henricksen helped turn the regional magazine into a major organ of critical discussion, bringing such theorists as Frederic Jameson, Jean-Francois Lyotard and others to the pages of the journal. His academic books include "Murray Krieger and Contemporary Critical Theory", "Reorientations: Critical Theories and Pedagogies", with Thais Morgan, and a widely referenced study of novelist Joseph Conrad entitled "Nomadic Voices: Conrad and the Subject of Narrative".
After surgery for throat cancer in 1996, Henricksen returned to Minnesota to live with his new wife, Victoria. There, what had previously been a secondary endeavor, writing fiction, became the primary one. His short stories appeared in numerous magazines, and in 2005 his story collection, "Ticket to a Lonely Town", was the only named finalist in the national competition for the Grace Paley Prize. It was published the following year by Atomic Quill Press. Stories in this book are connected by recurrent characters and places, as the collection dramatizes various causes and forms of loneliness. In 2008 his novel, "After the Floods" (Lost Hills Books) appeared. Praised by the New Orleans "Times-Picayune" as a "thoroughly enjoyable flight of fancy" and "a spiritual comedy," the novel, set partially in post-Katrina New Orleans, combines magical realism and deconstruction in a manner at once imaginative and excessible. Also in 2008, Henricksen co-edited a volume in honor of a former mentor, "From the Other World: Poems in Memory of James Wright" (Lost hills Books), to which many of our best-known poets contributed.
As of 2008, Bruce Henricksen lives in Duluth Minnesota. During that year, he spoke on James Wright in libraries in the Twin Cities and throughout Minnesota. He and a few contributors to the "From the Other World" also participated in a memorial event for James Wright at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, where he and Wright first met.

14 (number)

14 (fourteen ) is the natural number following 13 and preceding 15.
In speech, the numbers 14 and 40 are often confused. When carefully enunciated, they differ in which syllable is stressed: 14 vs 40 . However, in dates such as 1492 or when contrasting numbers in the teens, such as "13, 14, 15," the stress shifts to the first syllable: 14 . 
In mathematics.
Fourteen is a composite number, its divisors being , , and 14.
14 is the 3rd discrete semiprime (2.7) and the 3rd member of the (2.q) discrete semiprime family. The number following 14—15—is itself a discrete semiprime and this is the first such pair of discrete semiprimes. The next example is the pair commencing 21.
The aliquot sum σ(n) of 14 is 10, also a discrete semiprime and this is again the first example of a discrete semiprime having an aliquot sum in the same form. 14 has an aliquot sequence of 6 members (14,10,8,7,1,0)
14 is the third composite number in the 7-aliquot tree.
Fourteen is itself the Aliquot sum of two numbers; the discrete semiprime 22, and the square number 196.
Fourteen is the base of the tetradecimal notation.
In base fifteen and higher bases (such as hexadecimal), fourteen is represented as E.
Fourteen is the sum of the first three squares, which makes it a square pyramidal number.
This number is the lowest even n for which the equation φ(x) = n has no solution, making it the first even nontotient (see Euler's totient function).
14 is a Catalan number, the only semiprime among all Catalan numbers.
Take a set of real numbers and apply the closure and complement operations to it in any possible sequence. At most 14 distinct sets can be generated in this way. This holds even if the reals are replaced by a more general topological space. See Kuratowski's closure-complement problem.

<doc id="19223561" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19223561" title="Operation End Sweep">
Operation End Sweep

Operation End Sweep was a United States Navy and United States Marine Corps operation to remove naval mines from Haiphong harbor and other coastal and inland waterways in North Vietnam between February and July 1973. The operation fulfilled an American obligation under the Paris Peace Accord of January 1973, which ended direct American participation in the Vietnam War. It also was the first operational deployment of a U.S. Navy air mine countermeasures capability.
Background.
The United States had largely disengaged from the Vietnam War when North Vietnam launched its Easter Offensive into South Vietnam in March 1972. In response, the United States Air Force and U.S. Navy launched a major bombing offensive against North Vietnam. In addition, President of the United States Richard Nixon ordered the Commander-in-Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, Admiral Bernard A. Clarey, and the Commander-in-Chief, United States Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral James L. Holloway, to begin a mining campaign against Haiphong and other North Vietnamese ports. The mining campaign, by U.S. Navy and United States Marine Corps attack aircraft from American aircraft carriers, began on 8 May 1972, and over the next several months laid thousands of mines in North Vietnamese waters.
Eventually, North Vietnam and the United States negotiated an end to the war and signed the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam on 27 January 1973. A protocol to the agreement called for the United States to neutralize American mines in North Vietnams coastal and inland waterways.
Preparations.
Under the Hague Convention of 1907, the United States was required to eliminate the mine threat it had created after the end of hostilities. Accordingly, the U.S. Navys Mine Warfare Force (MINEWARFOR) began planning for removal of the mines as soon as Nixon ordered the mining campaign to begin. In order to ease post-war minesweeping, only mines that could be cleared by magnetic sweeps were used, and the vast majority of mines laid were programmed either to self-destruct or render themselves inert after a specified period of time. Of course, the U.S. Navy also knew generally where the mines had been laid, although the inherent inaccuracy of aerial minelaying meant that the precise location of each mine was not known.
Rear Admiral Brian McCauley became Commander, Mine Warfare Force, and Commander, Task Force 78, in September 1972. Task Force 78 was designated as Mine Countermeasures Force, U.S. Seventh Fleet, and was created for the upcoming minesweeping operation that would become known as End Sweep.
Minesweeping equipment and U.S. Navy personnel trained in minesweeping both were in short supply, so, in order to minimize the danger of mine explosions to American personnel and equipment, Task Force 78 planners devised an operational scheme in which minesweeping was limited to areas in which the mines already had rendered themselves inert. If all mines known to be in an area also were known to have passed their self-sterilization dates, Task Force 78 planned to conduct a check sweep of a few passes; if it was not clear that all mines in a given area had become inert, a more thorough clearance sweep was to be used.
In the United States, the Chief of Naval Materiel, Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, Jr., organized a Mine Warfare Program Office charged with controlling scientific and technical support to End Sweep. The program office ensured that resources were allocated to the operation that allowed the rapid development of shallow-water minesweeper gear and precision navigation and locating systems, the latter providing minesweeping forces with an improved capability to determine the configuration of a minefield and to adjust their daily operations accordingly.
Ten ocean minesweepers (MSOs) were assigned to Task Force 78 to sweep deep-water approaches to North Vietnamese ports and inland waterways and to serve as helicopter control vessels. In addition, the tank landing ship was modified in Japan between November 1972 and February 1973 to serve in End Sweep as a “special device minesweeper,” redesignated MSS-2. As such, she was intended to be used for check sweeps through waters which presumably were clear of active mines to ensure that passage indeed was safe. She was pumped full of polyurethane foam so that she would not sink if she struck a mine, was equipped with padding to protect her all-volunteer skeleton crew, and was modified so that her entire crew of six could remain topside during her minesweeping runs, ensuring that they would be blown overboard if she struck a mine rather be injured or killed by slamming into the overhead anywhere below decks.
The Navys newly created air mine countermeasures capability resided entirely in the CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 12 (HM-12), all of which were assigned to the operation. In addition, one detachment each from the Marine Corpss Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 463 (HMH-463) and Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 164 (HMM-164) provided a total of 24 more CH-53s. The helicopters practiced for the operation off Charleston, South Carolina, where it was discovered that the Marine Corps pilots inexperience in towing the heavy Mark 105 hydrofoil minesweeping sleds posed a risk to the personnel and equipment involved, a particularly unacceptable risk because of the scarcity and expense of the sleds. As a result, a scientist devised a buoyant, magnetized pipe filled with styrofoam which any helicopter pilot could tow easily. Painted orange, the new device became known as the Magnetic Orange Pipe (MOP).
Operations.
Task Force 78 was activated as a unit of the Seventh Fleet on 24 November 1972, while peace talks still were underway in Paris, and the ships and helicopter units making it up secretly gathered in the Philippines. The talks broke down in December 1972, however, so the task force awaited further developments into January 1973 while its helicopter crews practiced towing their minesweeping equipment in Subic Bay off Luzon.
On 28 January 1973 – the day after the peace accords were signed in Paris – Task Force 78 departed the Philippines for Haiphong. McCauley met in Haiphong with his North Vietnamese opposite, Colonel Hoang Huu Thai, on 5 February 1973 to coordinate North Vietnamese actions with those of Task Force 78.
Minesweeping began on 6 February 1973, when the ocean minesweepers , , , and swept coastal waters near Haiphong, protected by the guided-missile frigate and destroyer . On 27 February 1973, the amphibious assault ships , , and and the amphibious transport docks , , and joined the task force, carrying the 31 CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters of HM-12, HMM-165, and HMH-463. The helicopters swept the main shipping channel to Haiphong the same day. The next day, however, President Nixon ordered a suspension of End Sweep in response to North Vietnamese delays in releasing prisoners-of-war.
End Sweep resumed on 6 March 1973. On 9 March 1973, a mine exploded – the only one to explode during End Sweep – as a minesweeping helicopter passed it and the explosion was captured on film by the helicopters Swept Mine Locator. On 17 March 1973, Task Force 78 helicopters swept the ports of Hon Gai and Cam Pha. Elsewhere in North Vietnam, U.S. Navy technical personnel prepared 50 North Vietnamese sailors to conduct their own minesweeping operations and American C-130 Hercules transport aircraft delivered minesweeping gear to the North Vietnamese at Cat Bi Airfield outside Haiphong.
"Washtenaw County" arrived at Haiphong from the Philippines on 6 April 1973, and made her first six check runs there on 14 April 1973, the first American ship to enter Haiphong harbor in over a decade. She had made only two out of a planned six runs the following day when further runs were suspended because the United States believed that the North Vietnamese government was not fulfilling its obligations under the Paris Peace Accord. Washington ordered a suspension of all minesweeping operations and, on 17 April 1973, Task Force 78 returned to Subic Bay for upkeep.
On 13 June 1973, the United States and North Vietnam signed a joint communiqué in Paris which, among other things, required that the United States resume minesweeping no later than 20 June and complete all minesweeping no later than 13 July. With all mines by now past their latest possible sterilization date, End Sweep resumed on 18 June 1973. On 20 June, Task Force 78 completed its check sweeps of Haiphong, and soon had also cleared Hon Gai and Cam Pha. Next, the task force concentrated on the coastal areas off Vinh. The final minesweeping operations took place on 5 July 1973 and the next day, Rear Admiral McCauley informed the North Vietnamese that the United States had concluded its mine countermeasures operations in North Vietnamese waters.
Operation End Sweep ended officially on 27 July 1973, and Task Force 78 withdrew from North Vietnamese waters the following day.
Results.
In addition to "Engage", "Force", "Fortify", and "Impervious", the ocean minesweepers , , , , , and took part in some part of End Sweep; six of the ten ocean minesweepers conducted actual sweeping operations, as did "Washtenaw County" in her special role. Nine amphibious warfare ships, six fleet tugs, three salvage ships, and 19 destroyer-type ships also operated in Task Force 78 during at least a portion of the six months of End Sweep.
Two helicopters were lost, and "Enhance" suffered fire damage during the operation. The overall cost of the operation, including repairs to "Enhance", was USD $20,394,000 more than the cost expected for normal operations of the units involved. The six ocean minesweepers that had conducted actual minesweeping operations spent 439 hours involved in them.
Assessment.
Although End Sweep was a great success in the eyes of the American leadership and general public, U.S. Navy mine warfare analysts were less sanguine about what the operation had demonstrated. It was unusual in the U.S. Navy for a minesweeping operation to enjoy the political visibility and priority that End Sweep did, allowing the operation to make use of an amount and quality of U.S. Navy and Marine Corps staff, operational, and scientific resources not generally available to minesweeping, and analysts cautioned that such circumstances could not be counted on in future mine clearance campaigns. Moreover, the operation had been made relatively easy by the U.S. Navys knowledge of the types and locations of the mines that had been laid, the selection of only magnetic mines during the minelaying campaign, and the planned self-sterilization of so many mines before sweeping began.
The American public and many U.S. Navy personnel came away from End Sweep with the impression that helicopters had replaced surface ships in the minesweeping role due to their effectiveness and far greater mobility. Here, too, Navy mine warfare analysts differed with the popular impression. While helicopters swept three to six times faster than surface minesweepers, they also proved to be very demanding in terms of logistical support and manpower, and often were down for repair due to the high stress of minesweeping on the helicopters. Navy mine warfare analysts concluded that a balanced force of surface minesweepers and helicopters supported by a significant number of support ships would be required in future mine clearance operations.

List of Roman domes

This is a list of Roman domes. The Romans were the first builders in the history of architecture to realize the potential of domes for the creation of large and well-defined interior spaces. Domes were introduced in a number of Roman building types such as temples, thermae, palaces, mausolea and later also churches. Half-domes also became a favoured architectural element and were adopted as apses in Christian sacred architecture.
Monumental domes began to appear in the 1st century BC in Rome and the provinces around the Mediterranean Sea. Along with vaults, they gradually replaced the traditional post and lintel construction which makes use of the column and architrave. The construction of domes was greatly facilitated by the invention of concrete, a process which has been termed the "Roman Architectural Revolution". Their enormous dimensions remained unsurpassed until the introduction of structural steel frames in the late 19th century (see List of the world's largest domes).
Domes.
All diameters are clear span in m; for polygonal domes applies the in-circle diameter. Main source is Jürgen Rasch's study of Roman domes (1985).

Yves Farge

Yves Farge (19 August 1899, Salon-de-Provence, Bouches-du-Rhône − 31 March 1953, Tbilisi) was a French journalist and politician.
Biography.
Farge was a journalist for the "Progrès de Lyon". His colleague, Georges Altman, put him in contact with the French Resistance movement Franc-tireur. In 1942, Farge met Jean Moulin. Farge was but in charge of the military organization of the massif du Vercors. He was also a member of the "l’état-major" directed by General Delestraint. After the arrest of those two prominent resistance figures, Farge was sought by the Gestapo and went to Paris, where he presided over the "Comité d’action contre la déportation".
General Charles de Gaulle named Farge "commissaire de la République" for the departements of "la région rhodanienne". Farge saved 800 hostages who were at risk of being shot at Fort Montluc in Lyon.
Farge was politically left-wing without having any specific affiliation. He served as minister of "ravitaillement", a very difficult position, in the provisional government of Georges Bidault, from 8 January to 16 December 1946. He spoke out against wine smuggling and struggled hard against the black market.
Farge was a progressive, and close to the communists. He participated in the founding of the "Mouvement de la Paix" in 1947, of which he became the president until his death in 1953 in a car accident in Georgia. He was also a member of the World Peace Council. For his actions in support of peace, he was posthumously awarded the Stalin Peace Prize in 1953. 
Farge was a "compagnon de la Libération".

George Arnald

George Arnald ARA (1763 – 21 November 1841) was a British painter who specialised in landscapes, including topographical views to illustrated county histories. He is best known for his celebrated painting depicting the Battle of the Nile.
Biography.
George Arnald was born in 1763. One account places his birth in the village of Farndip (now Farndish) in Northamptonshire (now Bedfordshire), although others suggest he was born in Berkshire.
There is little information about Arnald's early years, but it is believed that he began his working life as a domestic servant before turning to the study of art. He was a student of the landscape painter and engraver William Pether (c. 1738–1821).
Arnald first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1788, and eventually had 176 works exhibited there. He also exhibited 63 works at the British Institution. He was elected an associate member of the Royal Academy on 5 November 1810, but was never admitted to full membership. Speaking to Sir George Beaumont, who was influential in the founding of the British Institution and the National Gallery, William Wordsworth lamented Arnald's lack of literary education, stating that he 
Probably his best-known and most acclaimed work was a departure from his usual subject-matter. "The Destruction of L'Orient at the Battle of the Nile, 1 August 1798" is Arnald's only known maritime work, and was one of four paintings commissioned for £500 each as part of a British Institution competition for paintings to hang in the Painted Hall of Greenwich Hospital. It was exhibited at the British Institution in 1827 and is now displayed at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London. It features as a "picture within a picture" in a work by Thomas Davidson, hanging alongside the famous Lemuel Abbott portrait of Lord Nelson in the gallery at Greenwich Hospital.
Arnald was a friend of fellow painter John Varley, and in 1798 and 1799 the two toured Wales together. His students included the portrait painter Henry William Pickersgill, who became a full Royal Academician and whose eminent sitters included William Wordsworth, the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel.
In addition to providing illustrations for a number of books, Arnald published on his own an album of views on the River Meuse in 1828 ["The river Meuse : being delineations of the picturesque scenery on the river and its banks, from the city of Liége to that of Mezières. The drawings were made ... in ... 1818 / and are etched by George Arnald, engraved in mezzotint by S. W. Reynolds, C. Turner, W. Ward ... , T. Lupton, H. Dawe, J. P. Quilley, etc. ... and other eminent engravers"]. In 1839 he published "A practical treatise on landscape painting in oil: illustrated by various diagrams and with two original studies in oil painted on the principles given in the treatise".
Arnald died in Pentonville, London on 21 November 1841.
Work in public collections and galleries.
Arnald's work features in collections including the Tate Collection, the Royal Academy of Arts Collection, the National Portrait Gallery, London, and the collections of the University of Liège in Belgium. The Ferens Art Gallery in Kingston upon Hull has his painting of "Charles I before Hull", and his scene of "The Army under Cromwell marching to Winchester" is in Winchester City Museum.

Eve's footprint

Eve's footprint is the popular name for a set of fossilized footprints discovered on the shore of Langebaan Lagoon, South Africa in 1995. They are thought to be those of a female human and have been dated to approximately 117,000 years ago. This makes them the oldest known footprints of an anatomically-modern human. The estimated age of Eve's footprint means that the individual who left the tracks in the soil, if female, would have lived within the current wide range of estimates for the date of Mitochondrial Eve.
History.
The three footprints were found in 1995 by geologist David Roberts from the Council for Geoscience and announced at a press conference with paleoanthropologist Lee R. Berger of the University of the Witwatersrand at Johannesburg at the National Geographic Society in Washington, D.C. The discovery was documented in the August, 1997, issue of the South African Journal of Science.
Berger and Roberts say the prints were made on a steep sand dune during a turbulent rainstorm. The location where they were found is in southwest South Africa about 60 to 70 miles (about 100 kilometres) northwest of Cape Town in the West Coast National Park. They were found in a ledge of sandstone at the edge of Langebaan Lagoon near the Atlantic coast. The preserved prints were moved to the South African Museum in Cape Town for protection and a concrete replica was mounted on the shores of Langebaan.
The maker of the footprints lived in the time of the emergence of modern "Homo sapiens", or people anatomically similar to humans alive today. The footprints measure eight and a half inches (22-26 centimetres) in length and are about the size of a modern-day (U.S.) woman's size 7½ shoe (British size 6, continental European size 39½). In one foot impression the big toe, ball, arch, and heel clearly are discernible. Roberts thinks that the prints belong to an ancient female about 1.5 meters (5'3" to 5'4") tall. He said that the woman who made these footprints would resemble a contemporary woman.
Fewer than three dozen hominid fossils from the period 100,000 to 200,000 years ago have been found. Berger said, "These footprints are traces of the earliest modern people." Roberts explained further that dry sand blew over the wet footprints and filled the prints. They eventually were buried to a depth of about nine meters (thirty feet). The sand and accompanying crushed seashells hardened like cement into sedimentary rock and protected the footprints.
The team later found associated evidence of stone tool use (a core, scrapers, cutting blades, and a spear point) in the same area that is believed to date from the same period. There also was evidence of the use of ochre, leading to the intriguing possibility that the 'Eve' of 117,000 years ago may have been wearing the colorful powder.

Released as a single in the fall of 1972, "I'd Love You to Want Me" was the singer's highest charting hit on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, where it spent two weeks at number two in November of that year. It was kept from the top spot by Johnny Nash's hit song, "I Can See Clearly Now". The song also spent one week at number one on the "Billboard" easy listening chart, Lavoie's second of four songs to achieve this feat.
When originally released in the United Kingdom in 1972, the song failed to reach the UK Singles Chart; however, a re-release of the single in 1974, on the UK label, peaked at #5.
The song also topped music charts in Australia (Kent Music Report, two weeks), Canada (RPM Magazine, one week) and Germany (Media Control Charts, 13 weeks in 1973-1974).

Order of the First Families of Virginia

The Order of the First Families of Virginia was instituted on 11 May 1912 "to promote historical, biographical, and genealogical researches concerning Virginia history during the period when she was the only one of the thirteen original colonies.".
The Order of the First Families of Virginia states its membership criteria as follows:
No membership list is made available. However, the Order of the First Families of Virginia sponsors the publication of "Adventurers of Purse and Person", which provides genealogical information on early colonists through the first six generations. The most recent edition is the Fourth, edited by the Order's genealogist John Frederick Dorman and published in three volumes, 2004-2007, to celebrate the four hundredth anniversary of the founding of Jamestown. Two groups of colonists are included: 1. Virginia Company shareholders "who either came to Virginia themselves between 1607-1624/4, and had descendants, or who did not come to Virginia within that period but whose grandchildren were resident there;" and 2. "Immigrants to Virginia ..., 1607-1624/5, who left descendants."
Since the membership criteria of the Order of the First Families of Virginia is broadly similar to the stated inclusion criteria for "Adventurers of Purse and Person", it follows that descendants of one or more of the "adventurers" included in the book, are also descendants of one or more of the First Families of Virginia.

List of New York Mets Opening Day starting pitchers

The New York Mets are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in Flushing, Queens, in New York City. They play in the National League East division. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The New York Mets have used 20 different Opening Day starting pitchers in their 50 seasons. The 20 starters have a combined Opening Day record of 26 wins, 12 losses (26–12) and 12 no decisions. No decisions are only awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game. 
Tom Seaver holds the Mets' record for most Opening Day starts with 11, and has an Opening Day record of 6–0. He also has the most starts in Shea Stadium, the Mets' home ballpark from 1964 through 2008. Seaver and Dwight Gooden hold the Mets' record for most Opening Day wins with six each. Al Jackson and Roger Craig share the worst winning percentage as the Opening Day starting pitcher with a record of 0–2.
From 1968 through 1983, Mets' Opening Day starting pitchers went 16 consecutive years without a loss. During this period, Tom Seaver won six starts with five no decisions, Craig Swan won two starts, and Jerry Koosman, Pat Zachry and Randy Jones won one start apiece. Furthermore, in the 31-year period from 1968 through 1998, Mets' Opening Day starting pitchers only lost two games. During that period, they won 19 games with 10 no decisions. The only losses during this period were by Mike Torrez in 1984 and by Dwight Gooden in 1990.
Overall, Mets Opening Day starting pitchers have a record of 0–1 at the Polo Grounds, a 13–5 record with four no decisions at Shea Stadium and a 1–0 record at Citi Field. In addition, although the Mets were nominally the home team in 2000, the game was played in Tokyo Dome in Tokyo, Japan. Mike Hampton started the game in Tokyo and lost, making the Mets' Opening Day starting pitchers' combined home record 14–7, and their away record 12–5. The Mets went on to play in the World Series in , , and , and won the 1969 and 1986 World Series championship games. Tom Seaver (1969 and 1973), Dwight Gooden (1986) and Mike Hampton (2000) were the Opening Day starting pitchers when the Mets played in the World Series, and they had a combined Opening Day record of 2–1.

Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

The federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac refers to the placing into conservatorship of government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by the U.S. Treasury in September 2008. It was one of the financial events among many in the ongoing subprime mortgage crisis.
On September 6, 2008, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), James B. Lockhart III, announced his decision to place two Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation), into conservatorship run by the FHFA.
At the same press conference, United States Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, stated that placing the two GSEs into conservatorship was a decision he fully supported, and that he advised "that conservatorship was the only form in which I would commit taxpayer money to the GSEs." He further said that "I attribute the need for today's action primarily to the inherent conflict and flawed business model embedded in the GSE structure, and to the ongoing housing correction."
The same day, Federal Reserve Bank chairman Ben Bernanke stated in support: "I strongly endorse both the decision by FHFA Director Lockhart to place Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship and the actions taken by Treasury Secretary Paulson to ensure the financial soundness of those two companies."
The following day, Herbert M. Allison was appointed chief executive of Fannie Mae. He came from TIAA-CREF.
Background and financial market crisis.
The combined GSE losses of US$14.9 billion and market concerns about their ability to raise capital and debt threatened to disrupt the U.S. housing financial market. The Treasury committed to invest as much as US$200 billion in preferred stock and extend credit through 2009 to keep the GSEs solvent and operating. The two GSEs have outstanding more than US$ 5 trillion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and debt; the debt portion alone is $1.6 trillion.
The conservatorship action has been described as "one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades,"
and one that "could turn into the biggest and costliest government bailout ever of private companies".
With a growing sense of crisis in U.S. financial markets, the conservatorship action and commitment by the U.S. government to backstop the two GSEs with up to US$ 200 billion in additional capital turned out to be the first significant event in a tumultuous month among U.S.-based investment banking, financial institutions and federal regulatory bodies. By September 15, 2008, the 158 year-old Lehman Brothers holding company filed for bankruptcy with intent to liquidate its assets, leaving its financially sound subsidiaries operational and outside of the bankruptcy filing. The collapse is the largest investment bank failure since Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1990.
The 94 year-old Merrill Lynch accepted a purchase offer by Bank of America for approximately US$ 50 billion, a big drop from a year-earlier market valuation of about US$ 100 billion. A credit rating downgrade of the large insurer American International Group (AIG) led to a September 16, 2008 rescue agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank for a US$85 billion secured loan facility, in exchange for a warrants for 79.9% of the equity of AIG.
Previous attempts for GSE reform.
The GSE business model has outperformed any other real estate business throughout its existence. According to the Annual Report to Congress, filed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, over a span of 37 years, from 1971 through 2007, Fannie's average annual loss rate on its mortgage book was about four basis points. Losses were disproportionately worse during the crisis years, 2008 through 2011, when Fannie's average annual loss rate was 52 basis points. Freddie Mac's results are comparable.
By way of contrast, during the 1991–2007 period, commercial banks' average annual loss rate on single family mortgages was about 15 basis points. During the 2008-2011 period, annual losses were 184 basis points.
Or take a look at the FHFA study that compares, on an apples-to-apples basis, GSEs loan originations with those for private label securitizations. The study segments loans four ways, by ARMs-versus-fixed-rate, as well as by vintage, by FICO score and by loan-to-value ratio. In almost every one of 1800 different comparisons covering years 2001 through 2008, GSE loan performance was exponentially better. On average, GSE fixed-rate loans performed four times better, and GSE ARMs performed five times better.
However, other critics in D.C. claim that the GSE business model faces inherent conflicts due its combination of government mission and private ownership. The GSEs were given monopoly privileges against which private enterprise could not compete. Both GSEs had a line of credit with the US Treasury Department, and both GSEs were exempt from state and local income tax on corporate earnings. The GSEs were the only two Fortune 500 companies exempt from regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because of implicit government backing, Fannie Mae Discount Notes became the second largest short-term notes issued (second only to T-bills).
The American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank, argues that "the government mission required them to keep mortgage interest rates low and to increase their support for affordable housing. Their shareholder ownership, however, required them to fight increases in their capital requirements and regulation that would raise their costs and reduce their risk-taking and profitability. But there were two other parties—Congress and the taxpayers—that also had a stake in the choices that Fannie and Freddie made. Congress got some benefits in the form of political support from the GSEs' ability to hold down mortgage rates, but it garnered even more political benefits from GSE support for affordable housing." However, such claims were at odds with the majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC).
In 2003, the Bush Administration sought to create a new agency, replacing the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 1992 in the wake of the Savings and Loan crisis, and over concern similar lending problems would develop, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight was created as part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. While Senate and House leaders voiced their intention to bring about the needed legislation, no reform bills materialized. A Senate reform bill introduced by Senator Jon Corzine (D-NJ) (S.1656) never made it out of the 21-member (10D/11R) Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. At the time members of the 108th congress expressed faith in the solvency of Fannie and Freddie. Congressman Barney Frank (D-MA), for example, described them as "not facing any kind of financial crisis." 
In 2005, the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act, sponsored by Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and co-sponsored by Senators Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), John McCain (R-AZ) and John Sununu (R-NH)[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:SN00190:@@@P], would have increased government oversight of loans given by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Like the 2003 bill, it also died in the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, this time in the 109th Congress. A full and accurate record of the congressional attempts to regulate the housing GSEs is given in the Congressional record prepared in 2005.
Federal Housing Finance Agency and Treasury authority.
The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008—passed by the United States Congress on July 24, 2008 with bipartisan support and signed into law by President George W. Bush on July 30, 2008 — enabled expanded regulatory authority over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by the newly established FHFA, and gave the U.S. Treasury the authority to advance funds for the purpose of stabilizing Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, limited only by the amount of debt that the entire federal government is permitted by law to commit to. The law raised the Treasury's debt ceiling by US$800 billion, to a total of US$10.7 trillion, in anticipation of the potential need for the Treasury to have the flexibility to support Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal Home Loan Banks.

Prior GSE support measures.
The September 7 conservatorship was termed by "The Economist" as the "second" bailout of the GSEs. Prior to the enactment of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, on July 13, 2008, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced an effort to backstop the GSEs based on prior statutory authority, in coordination with the Federal Reserve Bank. That announcement occurred after a week in which the market values of shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fell almost by half (from a previously diminished value of approximately half of year-earlier market highs).
That plan contained three measures: an increase in the line of credit available to the GSEs from the Treasury, so as to provide liquidity; the right for the Treasury to purchase equity in the GSEs, so as to provide capital; and a consultative role for the Federal Reserve in a reformed GSE regulatory system.
On the same day, the Federal Reserve announced that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would have the right to lend to the GSEs as necessary.
Capital infusion by the Treasury.
The agreement the Treasury made with both GSEs specifies that in exchange for future support and capital investments of up to US$ 100 billion in each GSE, at the inception of the conservatorship, each GSE shall issue to the Treasury US$ 1 billion of senior preferred stock, with a 10% coupon, without cost to the Treasury.
Also each GSE contracted to issue common stock warrants representing an ownership stake of 79.9%, at an exercise price of one-thousandth of a U.S. cent ($ 0.00001) per share, and with a warrant duration of twenty years.
The conservator, FHFA signed the agreements on behalf of the GSEs.
The 100 billion amount for each GSE was chosen to indicate the level of commitment that the U.S. Treasury is willing to make to keep the financial operations and financial conditions solvent and sustainable for both GSEs. The agreements were designed to protect the senior and subordinated debt and the mortgage backed securities of the GSEs. The GSEs' common stock and existing preferred shareholders will bear any losses ahead of the government. Among other conditions of the agreement, each GSE’s retained mortgage and mortgage backed securities portfolio shall not exceed $850 billion as of December 31, 2009, and shall decline by 10% per year until it reaches $250 billion.
FHFA initial actions as conservator.
In the September 6, 2008 conservatorship announcement, Lockhart indicated the following items in the plan of action for the Federal Housing Finance Agency conservatorship:
Government support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
In addition to the government conservatorship, which CBO estimates will increase the federal government's net liabilities by $238 billion, several government agencies have taken steps to increase liquidity within Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Among these steps includes:
National debt accounting.
The on- or off-balance sheet obligations of the two GSEs, which are "independent" corporations rather than federal agencies, are just over $5 trillion, a significant amount when compared to the $9.5 trillion of officially reported United States public debt at the time of the takeover.
The September 6, 2008 conservatorship and the subsequent planned Treasury infusion of capital support the senior liabilities, subordinated indebtedness, and mortgage guarantees of the two firms. Some observers see this as an effective nationalization of the companies that ultimately places taxpayers at risk for all their liabilities.
The federal government follows specialized accounting standards set by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board. The net exposure to taxpayers is difficult to determine at the time of the takeover and depends on several factors, such as declines in housing prices and losses on mortgage assets in the future.
The Congressional Budget Office director Peter R. Orszag announced on September 9, 2008 that the CBO intended to incorporate the assets and liabilities of the two companies into their federal budget planning, due to the degree of government control over the entities.
The White House Budget Director Jim Nussle, on September 12, 2008 indicated their budget plans would not incorporate the GSE debt into the budget because of the temporary nature of the conservator intervention.
Bloomberg reported that according to CMA Datavision of London that "five-year credit-default swap contracts on U.S. government debt increased 3.5 basis points on September 9, 2008 to a record 18, up from 6 basis points in April," in reaction to concerns about the potential rise in U.S. debt from bailouts.
Market consequences.
Bank reserves.
Many commercial banks in the United States own Freddie and Fannie preferred shares. Those shares have had their dividends suspended, and are junior to the senior preferred stock issued to the Treasury in the restructuring of the two companies. The market value of the preferred shares plunged after the restructuring announcement and suspension of dividends. Banks were required to write down the value of Freddie and Fannie preferred stock held in their portfolios, compounding capitalization concerns for certain U.S. banks. Gateway bank agreed to be bought out by Hampton Roads Bankshares Inc. to make up for a writedown of $40 million on its stock in Fannie and Freddie, which put it below regulatory requirements to be considered adequately capitalized.
Credit default swaps.
In the credit default swap (CDS) market, the standard contracts typically used between parties to a swap define the action of placing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship to be equivalent to bankruptcy, because of the change in management control. In CDS parlance, this is termed a credit event, and that triggers the settling of outstanding contracts for the derivatives, which are used to hedge or speculate on the potential risk that a company will default on its bonds. The two GSEs have approximately US$ 1.5 trillion in bonds outstanding, and since the market in credit default swaps is not public, there is no central reporting mechanism to verify how many credit default swaps are linked to those bonds. One estimate floated is US$ 500 billion, and that the entire CDS market has a notional value in the vicinity of US$ 62 trillion.
Settlement on the contracts, will likely be the largest in the market's decade-long history.
Credit-default swaps on Fannie and Freddie have been among the most actively traded the several months leading up to the conservatorship. "Thirteen 'major' dealers of credit-default swaps agreed 'unanimously' that the rescue constitutes a credit event triggering payment or delivery of the companies' bonds," according to a memo circulated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) after the conservatorship announcement.
The day after the conservatorship announcement, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, which sets industry standardized contracts for financial derivatives and swaps, announced it was working on a protocol on how to evaluate and settle Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credit default swaps. Most of these swaps were settled on October 6, 2008.
Paradoxically (in relation to typical experiences when a company issuing bonds has a "credit event"), the value of the two GSEs bonds rose to the vicinity of par value after the conservatorship. This means, that some owners of swaps that were hedging against the risk of a bond default, may be worse off, since the value of the bonds may be higher than when they purchased the swap. Cash auctions are reported to be scheduled for October 2008 to settle CDS contracts in relation to the GSEs.
September 2008 reactions to the seizure.
The immediate reactions in the finance markets on Monday September 8, the day following the seizure, appeared to indicate satisfaction with at least the short-term implications of the Treasury's intervention. Governor of the Bank of Japan Masaaki Shirakawa stated "We expect the action would lead to stabilize the U.S. securities market, financial market and the international financial market." Governor of the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan stated "From my point of view this is positive".
Effects on the subprime mortgage crisis.
The effects on the subprime mortgage crisis have led the government to support the soundness of the obligations and guarantees on securities issued by Fannie and Freddie to obtain funds. Those funds are in turn used to purchase mortgages from originating banks. The continuing soundness of GSE obligations enhances market liquidity (loanable funds) in the following ways:
Financial condition of Fannie and Freddie prior to takeover.
Over 98% of Fannie's loans were paying timely during 2008. Both Fannie and Freddie had positive net worth as of the date of the takeover, meaning the value of their assets exceeded their liabilities. However, Fannie's total assets to capital (leverage ratio) was about 20:1, while Freddie's was about 70:1. These numbers increase significantly if one includes all of the mortgage-backed assets they guaranteed. These ratios are considerably higher than investment banks, which leverage around 30:1.
However, there was concern that the GSEs' liquidity was insufficient to handle growing delinquency rates, such that although viable in September 2008, the scale of loss in the future would be sufficient that insolvency would occur and that knowledge of this future failure would induce immediate or near-immediate failure due to buyers refusing to buy debt. Both GSEs roll-over large amounts of debt on a quarterly basis and failure to sell debt would lead to failure due to lack of liquidity. A slower form of failure would be the issuing of debt at high cost (to compensate buyers for risk) and this would greatly diminish the earning power of both GSEs, rendering them unable to earn the money they would need to handle expected future losses. Both GSEs counted large amounts of deferred tax assets towards their regulatory capital, which were considered by some to be of "low quality" and not truly available capital. The deferred tax assets would only have value if the companies were profitable and could use the assets to offset future taxes. Both companies had experienced significant losses and were likely to face more over the next year or longer.
Ongoing status of Fannie and Freddie conservatorship.
In testimony before a House Financial Services Committee subcommitee on June 3, 2009, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director James B. Lockhart III presented his report, “The Present Condition and Future Status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac”. Highlights of the report include, the Treasury Department’s commitment to fund up to $200 billion in capital for each Enterprise is expected be sufficient; the Enterprises own or guarantee 56% of the single family mortgages in this country, or $5.4 trillion of the total $11.9 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt; their combined share of mortgages originated in the first quarter of 2009 was 73%; private-label mortgage-backed securities (PLS) are a major driver of Enterprise losses; both Enterprises are heavily involved in planning and implementing the Making Home Affordable and the Home Affordable Refinance programs. The report notes:
As of March 31, 2009, seriously delinquent loans accounted for 2.3% of single-family mortgages owned or guaranteed for Freddie Mac and 3.2% for Fannie Mae. While those are historically high levels, they compare favorably to industry averages of 4.7% for all prime loans, 7.2% for all single-family mortgages, 24.9% for all subprime mortgages, and 36.5% for subprime adjustable rate mortgages
The report provides background on the origins of PLS and the risk they present. PLS loans represent only 15% of mortgages but 50% of serious delinquencies. In contrast at year-end 2008, the loans the Enterprises held or guaranteed represented 56% of the U.S. single family mortgages outstanding, but only 20% of serious delinquencies. The credit quality of investments in PLS has proven to be much worse than the initial AAA credit ratings of those securities would have suggested. The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the true economic value of PLS will continue to raise safety and soundness concerns.
The report notes the for-profit structure of the GSEs worked counter to prudent risk management as competition reduced both marketshare and profits, thus eroding the GSEs credit requirements. To maintain profitability, each Enterprise increased purchases of PLS backed by alternative mortgages and of high-risk whole loans. And while many had criticized the OFHEO and sought to replace it:
The George W. Bush administration was prevented from taking official action due to Senate Bill 190 of the 109 Congress never being allowed a full Senate vote, even though it was passed out of committee on a 13-9 vote along party lines (13 Republicans voted "Yes" and 9 Democrats voted "No"), doing so would have prevented Congress' home ownership goals being realized.
On June 16, 2010, it was announced that the two GSEs would have their shares delisted from the NYSE.
An article from August 2012 in Bloomberg noted that the companies "have drawn $190 billion in aid and paid $46 billion in dividends since being taken over by U.S. regulators in 2008" 
On September 24, 2012, a judge dismissed a class-action lawsuit that contended that Freddie Mac made misleading statements about its exposure to risky loans in the run-up to the company's federal takeover.
Plans to rent houses.
On August 10, 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency asked investors for ideas on renting homes owned by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration.

In Toltec legend, Chalchiuhtlatonac (Precious-stone-who-shines) was the second son of a ruler of the Chichemecs who governed the Toltecs for 52 years. He obtained this position because in a step toward diplomacy, the Toltecs to the south had asked the ruler to provide a chief from his family, and he, much flattered, gave them Chalchiuhtlatonac, his second son.

"I'd Never Thought I'd Live to be a Hundred" is a 1969 song by The Moody Blues, from their album "To Our Children's Children's Children", and written by Justin Hayward.
The song is a short ballad with the theme of accomplishment and longevity. The realization of all that the narrator has accomplished makes it seem as if he has lived to be a hundred.
The sequel to the song, "I Never Thought I'd Live to be a Million", which lasts only half a minute, has the same theme, except that the narrator now imagines himself to be a million years old.

Hurricane Ekeka

Hurricane Ekeka (international designation: 9202, JTWC designation: 01C) was an unusual Pacific tropical cyclone that attained major hurricane status during the month of February. The first storm of the 1992 Pacific hurricane season, Ekeka developed on January 28 well to the south of Hawaii. It gradually intensified to reach major hurricane status on February 2, although it subsequently began to weaken due to unfavorable wind shear. It crossed the International Date Line as a weakened tropical storm, and shortly thereafter degraded to tropical depression status. Ekeka continued westward, passing through the Marshall Islands and later over Chuuk State, before dissipating on February 9 about 310 miles (500 km) off the north coast of Papua New Guinea. The storm did not cause any significant damage or deaths.
Meteorological history.
During the El Niño of 1991–92, as typical with other such events, the monsoon trough extended into the central north Pacific Ocean, which is the body of water between the International Date Line and 140ºW. At the same time, sea surface temperatures near the equator were anomalously warm, and wind shear values were low. At the end of January, a large area of convection persisted for several days near the north side of the equator. By January 23, several ships reported squalls and strong southwesterly winds in the region. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring the system on January 26, while it was located about 950 miles (1530 km) south of Ka Lae, the southernmost point in Hawaii. The disturbance organized further as it tracked westward, and on January 28 it developed into Tropical Depression One-C, located a short distance north of Kiritimati and east of Tabuaeran.
With favorable conditions, the depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm; upon doing so, it was named "Ekeka" by the CPHC, which is Hawaiian for Edgar. Ekeka continued gradually intensifying while moving slowly west-northwestward, and it attain hurricane status on January 30 about 100 miles (160 km) northwest of Palmyra Atoll. On February 2, the hurricane attained peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), making Ekeka a major hurricane, or Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Subsequently, it began to weaken due to increased wind shear, and concurrently its forward motion increased as the subtropical ridge strengthened to the north of the hurricane. A large trough in the Westerlies increased the wind shear, which weakened Ekeka to a tropical storm early on February 3. Later that day, it crossed the International Date Line into the western Pacific Ocean; the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed the storm's winds at 50 mph (85 km/h), while the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated winds at 60 mph (95 km/h). At the time, the JMA assessed the pressure as 985 mbar, which is the lowest known minimum central pressure associated with the storm; the CPHC did not include pressure in their year-end report.
Tropical Storm Ekeka continued weakening, degrading to tropical depression status by February 4. The depression moved quickly through the Marshall Islands, and on February 6 turned to the west-southwest. On February 8, the JMA declared Ekeka dissipated; however, the JTWC continued monitoring the system, with Ekeka passing over Chuuk as a weak depression. Early on February 9, the JTWC declared Ekeka dissipated about 800 miles (1300 km) east-southeast of Palau, or about 310 miles (500 km) off the north coast of Papua New Guinea.

No deaths were reported in association with Ekeka. The storm passed through the Marshall Islands without causing significant impact. When Ekeka hit the island of Chuuk, winds of 20 mph (32 km/h) were reported.
While in the central Pacific Ocean, Ekeka became one of only three tropical cyclones on record to be located within the Palmyra Atoll Exclusive Economic Zone; Ekeka was the only hurricane within the area.
Ekeka is most unusual for its formation in January. Tropical cyclones rarely form east of the International Date Line outside of the tropical cyclone season, which starts May 15 in the eastern Pacific and June 1 in the central Pacific, and which ends on November 30 in both regions. In the official Pacific hurricane database, Ekeka was the only tropical cyclone on record to occur in January or February within the Pacific Ocean east of the International Date Line; as such, it was also the earliest cyclone on record within the basin.

Tecpancaltzin

Tecpancaltzin was the eighth Toltec chief. He married a woman named Xochitl, who showed him how to extract pulque from the heart of the maguey plant ("Agave americana"). This discovery and their relationship, however, led to the ruin of the Toltecs, according to Toltec legend, as these were blamed for the string of famines, pest infestations, and invasions that followed.
Tecpancaltzin was succeeded by Topiltzin-Meconetzin (Son of Maguey), the last chieftain.

Armenians in Ethiopia

There is a small community of Armenians in Ethiopia, primarily in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. Armenians had traded with Ethiopia from the first century AD.
Religion.
The Armenian presence in Ethiopia is historic. On a religious basis, the Ethiopian Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church are both members of the Oriental Orthodox communion of churches alongside Coptic Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox and Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (India) churches.
The Armenian inhabitants in Ethiopia are Armenian Apostolics (Orthodox Armenians) belonging to the Armenian Apostolic Church.
The Armenian Apostolic (Orthodox) have their own church, Sourp Kevork (St. George) Armenian Apostolic Church in Addis Ababa.
The first-ever pastor of the Armenian community was Rev. Hovhannes Guevherian.
History.
Armenians had traded with Ethiopia from as early as the first century AD. 
Besides the obvious religious affiliation, there is also the story of the Arba Lijoch children coming to Ethiopia after the Armenian Genocide. "Arba Lijoch" were a group of 40 Armenian orphans who had escaped from the atrocities in Turkey, and were afterwards adopted by Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, then Crown Prince Ras Tafari. He had met them while visiting the Armenian monastery in Jerusalem. They impressed him so much that he obtained permission from the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem to adopt and bring them to Ethiopia, where he then arranged for them to receive musical instruction. 
The Arba Lijoch arrived in Addis Ababa in 1924, and along with their bandleader Kevork Nalbandian became the first official orchestra of the nation. Nalbandian also composed the music for "Marsh Teferi" (words by Yoftehé Negusé), which was the Imperial National Anthem from 1930 to 1974.
Armenians have a much older presence in Ethiopia. Indeed one of the first recorded diplomatic missions to Europe from Ethiopia was led by Matthew the Armenian who traveled to Portugal and Rome at the request of the Dowager Empress Eleni of Ethiopia to appeal for aid against Islamic incursions into Ethiopia in the 16th Century.
