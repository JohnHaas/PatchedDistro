Political positions of Sarah Palin

Sarah Palin has expressed her positions on a wide range of political issues during her career in the public eye.
Social and legal issues.
Religion in public life.
Despite attending a Pentecostal church which supported abstinence from alcohol, Palin, then on the Wasilla City Council, cast the deciding vote against restricting the hours during which the city's bars could operate. According to Rev. Gene Straatmeyer, a local Presbyterian minister, Palin told him during a City Council hearing, "'I go to Assembly of God Church and I am a Sunday school teacher there and I see no relationship between my Christian faith and what hours the bars close.'" Straatmeyer continued, "She felt it was out of line for me to testify on behalf of the church groups I represented." The effort to restrict bar hours was intended to combat drunken driving and spousal abuse, but Palin felt that restricting bar hours would hurt the local economy.
During a candidates' debate for governor in 2006, when asked how she would feel if a church pastor endorsed a candidate for governor, Palin said that she "would never support any government effort to stifle our freedom of religion or freedom of expression or freedom of speech," but would caution the pastor that the endorsement could result in "frustration" and "fewer dollars in the offering plate".
In 2006, Palin told the Associated Press that her personal beliefs would not dictate her public policies, adding that she was "not one to be out there preaching and forcing my views on anyone else."
During a debate for Governor of Alaska in 2006, Palin said she was a proponent of teaching both creationism and evolution in the Alaska public schools. The following day she said: "It doesn't have to be part of the curriculum", and that she would not push to have it added. She also said she would not use religion or views on creationism as a litmus test in picking members of the Alaska Board of Education. (Under state law, the Board of Education determines the content of the public schools' curriculum.) Palin has also said that evolution "should be taught as an accepted principle. And, as you know, I say that also as the daughter of a school teacher, a science teacher, who has really instilled in me a respect for science. It should be taught in our schools. And I won't deny that I see the hand of God in this beautiful creation that is Earth. But that is not part of the state policy or a local curriculum in a school district. Science should be taught in science class."
While Governor, Palin vetoed public funding for private, Christian schools, saying after the fact, "I'm a Christian... funding is unconstitutional. It's illegal. You can't do that. I had to go in there and veto those things and, of course, was accused then of being, 'Oh, you're not a real conservative or a real Republican. Otherwise, you would have fought for that.' No, illegal is illegal."
As Alaska Governor, she signed the "Christian Heritage Week" Proclamation in October 2007 which "reminds Alaskans of the role Christianity has played in our rich heritage." She also declared the week of November 18–25, 2007 as "Bible Week" in Alaska, stating that "the Bible has profoundly influenced art, literature, music, and codes of law."
After the 2008 Republican National Convention, Palin's religious views became the subject of media interest and even scrutiny. She had attended a Pentecostal church for 26 years which practiced laying on of hands and speaking in tongues during church services. She was quoted as saying that she had grown up in the Pentecostal Assembly of God church and that nothing about the service disturbed her. Before running for statewide office in 2002, however, she began attending the non-denominational Wasilla Bible Church, a church which was described by The Times as "more reserved". In June 2008 she made a return visit to her former church, where she gave a speech to ministry students linking religion to war and energy. She said that it was God's will that the Alaska gas pipeline be completed. In October 2008, the McCain campaign said that Palin had deeply held religious beliefs and did not consider herself a Pentecostal.
On June 10, 2010, Palin expressed dismay on her Twitter account that the floodlights of the Empire State Building would not be changed blue and white in honor of Mother Teresa's 100th birthday. Palin asked why the building's owner "won't honor Mother Theresa's compassionate, selfless efforts for humanity, but will honor Communist Mao?" Palin was referring to the Empire State Building's September 9, 2009 lighting scheme, when it was bathed in red and yellow to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Palin opposed the construction of Park51, a proposed 13-story Islamic cultural center with mosque, planned to be built in New York City on Park Place between West Broadway and Church Street, two blocks away from Ground Zero.
In the wake of the Supreme Court decision "Snyder v. Phelps", which held that the Westboro Baptist Church had the right to picket the funerals of dead soldiers on a public sidewalk, Palin asserted that the Court held a double standard for the WBC's speech, as opposed to other religious speech. On March 2, 2011, she tweeted: "Common sense & decency absent as wacko 'church' allowed hate msgs spewed@ soldiers' funerals but we can't invoke God's name in public square" Palin clarified her tweet the next day: "Obviously my comment meant that when we’re told we can’t say ‘God bless you’ in graduation speeches or pray before a local football game but these wackos can invoke God’s name in their hate speech while picketing our military funerals, it shows ridiculous inconsistency. I wasn’t calling for any limit on free speech, and it’s a shame some folks tried to twist my comment in that way. I was simply pointing out the irony of an often selective interpretation of free speech rights.”
Gun rights.
Palin, a strong proponent of gun ownership rights, and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, has stated that she is against a ban on semi-automatic firearms, and was shown firing a military assault rifle in a 2008 campaign video. She praised "District of Columbia vs. Heller", the Supreme Court decision in that invalidated Washington D.C.'s ban on handguns, and believes that any regulation of handgun possession violates the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. She is in favor of gun-safety education for children, and is said to be popular among gun rights advocates.
Abortion.
Palin is opposed to abortion in almost all cases, including rape and incest, but not if the life of the mother is endangered. In 2006, while running for governor, Palin was asked what she would do if her own daughter were raped and became pregnant; she responded that she would "choose life." She and her husband have stated that they have "faith that every baby is created for a good purpose." When asked what she would do as governor if "Roe v. Wade" were overturned, she responded "it would not be up me to unilaterally ban anything. It would be up to the people of Alaska to discuss and decide how we would like our society to reflect our values." Palin personally supported bills to outlaw late-term abortions and to require parental consent for underage abortions in Alaska, but rebuffed religious conservatives who wanted to legislate restrictions on abortion even though she agreed with the bills.
In her televised interview with ABC News anchor Charlie Gibson on September 12, 2008, Sarah Palin made the statement that as a politician she felt that her opinions were to be made openly to the public, but that sometimes it may differ with political legislation. When Gibson asked if she thought "Roe v. Wade" should be overturned, she replied, "I think it should and I think that states should be able to decide that issue." Palin also said that she hoped "to reach out and work with those who are on the other side of this issue, because I know that we can all agree on the need for and the desire for fewer abortions in America and greater support for adoption, for other alternatives that women can and should be empowered to embrace, to allow that culture of life." Gibson noted that Republican presidential nominee John McCain allows exceptions for rape or incest, and asked, "Do you believe in it only in the case where the life of the mother is in danger?" Palin answered, "That is my personal opinion." When pressed on the matter, she said, "My personal opinion is that abortion allowed if the life of the mother is endangered. Please understand me on this. I do understand McCain's position on this. I do understand others who are very passionate about this issue who have a differing ."
Stem cell research.
Palin stated in 2006 that because she believes embryonic stem cell research causes the destruction of life, this research is inconsistent with her pro-life position and she does not support it.
All of the various adult stem cell research approaches are supported by Palin. In an interview with Charlie Gibson, Palin differentiated between the two types of stem cell research "And thankfully, again, not only are there other options, but we're getting closer and closer to finding a tremendous amount of other options, like, as I mentioned, the adult stem cell research".
Sex education.
Palin answered a 2006 gubernatorial questionnaire by choosing support for funding of abstinence-before-marriage programs over support for "explicit sex-education programs, school-based clinics and the distribution of contraceptives in schools". In a subsequent radio interview with KTOO (FM) in Juneau, Alaska, she clarified her position by saying she was against "explicit" sex education, but was in favor of contraceptive education. She characterized in-school discussion of condoms as "relatively benign" and not something that would define an "explicit" program. Palin said of contraception that "kids who may not hear about it at home should hear about it in other avenues." Rebecca Traister of Salon.com analyzed Palin's political record as one that demonstrated her lack of enthusiasm about the Bush era promotion of abstinence-before-marriage education, and one that showed she did not work against existing sex education laws in Alaska.
Women's issues.
Feminism.
Palin has been a member of Feminists for Life since 2006. In August 2006, she told the "Anchorage Daily News" that "no woman should have to choose between her career, education and her child." In an interview with Katie Couric on September 30, 2008, Palin said, "I'm a feminist who believes in equal rights and I believe that women certainly today have every opportunity that a man has to succeed, and to try to do it all, anyway. And I'm very, very thankful that I've been brought up in a family where gender hasn't been an issue."
In subsequent interviews with Brian Williams on October 29, 2008, Palin was quoted as saying, "I am not going to label myself anything, Brian, and I think that's what annoys a lot of Americans, especially in a political campaign is start trying to label different parts of America, different backgrounds. I'm not going to label myself, but I do believe in women's rights; I believe in equal rights, and I am so thankful I was brought up in where really gender has never been an issue."
During various public appearances, such as her May 14 Susan B. Anthony List speech, Palin has referred to the suffragettes as "feminist foremothers" and has called for a "new, conservative feminist movement". Her comments have sparked considerable debate about the nature of feminism and its relation to conservatism and abortion.
Birth status of Barack Obama.
In a December 3, 2009, interview with Rusty Humphries, Palin was asked about President Barack Obama's birth certificate. She stated, "I think the public rightfully is still making it an issue. I don't have a problem with that. I don't know if I would have to bother to make it an issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers." When asked if people had a legitimate reason to question the certificate, she stated, "I think it's a fair question, just like I think past association and past voting records – all of that is fair game." She also stated that the questions were 'fair play' because, "the weird conspiracy theory freaky thing that people talk about that Trig isn't my real son – 'You need to produce his birth certificate, you need to prove that he's your kid,' which we have done. Maybe we can reverse that."
Palin later clarified her position in a Facebook posting by stating: "Voters have every right to ask candidates for information if they so choose. I’ve pointed out that it was seemingly fair game during the 2008 election for many on the left to badger my doctor and lawyer for proof that Trig is in fact my child. Conspiracy-minded reporters and voters had a right to ask... which they have repeatedly. But at no point – not during the campaign, and not during recent interviews – have I asked the president to produce his birth certificate or suggested that he was not born in the United States."
In February 2011, Palin dismissed discussion of Obama's religion and birth status, stating: “The faith, the birth certificate, others can engage in that kind of conversation. It’s distracting. It gets annoying. And let’s just stick with what really matters." Although she believes Barack Obama was born in Hawaii, she did give praise to Donald Trump's questions regarding Barack Obama's birth certificate saying,
"There is something there that the president doesn't want people to see on that birth certificate."
Same-sex unions.
While campaigning for election as Governor of Alaska in 2006, Palin declared that she supported the 1998 Alaska constitutional amendment that proposed adding "...a marriage may exist only between one man and one woman" to the Alaskan constitution in order to ensure that same-sex marriage did not become legal in that state.
Palin opposed state-covered health and retiree benefits to same-sex partners of state employees but complied with an Alaska Supreme Court directive to do so and subsequently vetoed a bill that would have denied the benefits. In an interview with "Newsweek" in 2007, she affirmed her support for an amendment to the state constitution denying benefits to same-sex couples. She later signed a bill ordering a non-binding referendum for a constitutional amendment to deny the benefits. Although the referendum passed in April 2007, with 53 percent of voters supporting a constitutional amendment, a bill to place such an amendment on the ballot in November 2008 stalled in the state legislature.
Palin has stated that she supports a Federal Constitutional Amendment to ban same-sex marriage. This position differed with that of her running mate, John McCain. In a July 31, 2012 interview with Greta Van Susteren, Palin was asked about states' rights as they pertained to same-sex marriage, to which Palin responded, "I believe that states have that constitutional right to make decisions about a variety of issues, but when it comes to some very fundamental, very cornerstone aspects of our society, of our culture, I personally would love to see a national dialogue about what will America continue to define as marriage. As a former Governor, I say let the states decide that, and that's where I would be, if I were in national office. I'd be saying let the states decide. And if you see, Greta, and pay attention to where the states have gone with this particular issue and the votes of the people, overwhelmingly the people within the states have said they want to continue to define marriage as one man and one woman, as the Muslims do, Orthodox Jews do, nondenominational Christians do, faith-practicing Catholics do. It truly is a cornerstone of religion and civilization."
On March 1, 2011, Palin told National Organization for Marriage Chairman Maggie Gallagher that she opposed the Obama administration's refusal to continue defending the Defense of Marriage Act: "I have always believed that marriage is between one man and one woman. Like the majority of Americans, I support the Defense of Marriage Act and find it appalling that the Obama administration decided not to defend this federal law which was enacted with broad bipartisan support and signed into law by a Democrat president. It’s appalling, but not surprising that the President has flip-flopped on yet another issue from his stated position as a candidate to a seemingly opposite position once he was elected."
Legal system.
Judicial appointments.
While interviewing candidates to fill judge vacancies in Alaska state courts, Palin asked prospective appointees questions about work history, background and basic judicial philosophy. She did not ask such individuals about their positions on abortion or any other specific cases.
Jury rights.
On August 31, 2007, Palin signed a Jury Rights Day Proclamation, commemorating September 5, 2007 as the 337th anniversary of the acquittal, in defiance of the legal direction of the bench, of William Penn and William Mead for preaching a Quaker sermon.
Crime and violence.
Capital punishment.
Palin has declared herself in favor of capital punishment. She has stated: "If the legislature passed a death penalty law, I would sign it. We have a right to know that someone who rapes and murders a child or kills an innocent person in a drive-by shooting will never be able to do that again."
Drugs.
Palin is opposed to efforts to decriminalize or legalize marijuana, which she says sends the wrong message to children. Palin does not support full legalization of medical cannabis but said, "I’m not going to get in the way of a doctor prescribing something that he or she believes will help a cancer patient." Palin has admitted to using marijuana, though at a time when doing so was legal under state law. Palin has also said she is more concerned about methamphetamine, which she sees as a greater social threat.
During her June 12, 2010, appearance on "Freedom Watch", Palin elaborated on her stance that even though marijuana should not be legalized, enforcement of marijuana prohibition laws should be made a lower priority: "Well, if we’re talking about pot, I’m not for the legalization of pot because I think that that would just encourage, especially, our young people to think that it was okay to go ahead and use it. And I’m not an advocate for that. However, I think that we need to prioritize our law enforcement efforts. And if somebody’s gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody else any harm, then perhaps there are other things that our cops should be looking at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other problems that we have in society that are appropriate for law enforcement to do and not concentrate on such a, relatively speaking, minimal problem that we have in the country."
On an April 13, 2012, appearance on "Stossel", Palin explained that she disagreed with host John Stossel on the subject of drug legalization but reiterated her belief that the government should better prioritize drug laws: "You take even more of a stronger libertarian view than I do on some of those issues, like the War on Drugs. I happen to believe that we need to continue to do all that we can to discourage drug use, especially with our youth. I would like to see, though, law enforcement prioritize its time and resources and not go out and bust a guy in his house, maybe smoking a joint, who's not doing anybody else any harm, and, in the meantime, go out and find the bad guys and you know, try to help keep society safe that way. Just prioritize; use common sense."
Illegal immigration.
On October 31, 2008, Palin told reporter Greta Van Susteren that closing the borders should be the first priority in dealing with illegal immigration. She rejects amnesty for illegal immigrants who have violated federal law. Palin did, however, state that she supported a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.
On July 31, 2009, Palin announced in a tweet that she supported a bill by Alaska State Representative Bob Lynn which would forbid issuance of a State identification card or driver's license "to a person who has not presented to the department valid documentary evidence that the person is a citizen of the United States, a national of the United States, a legal permanent resident of the United States, or a conditional resident alien of the United States."
In a December 3, 2009, radio interview with Rusty Humphries, Palin was asked her position on illegal aliens and closing the Mexico – United States border, to which she replied, "We must close the border. They're called 'illegal aliens' for a reason, and if they're not going to follow the rules, they should not be in our country."
On the April 28, 2010, episode of "Hannity", Palin expressed support for the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, which makes it a state misdemeanor crime for an alien to be in Arizona without carrying registration documents required by federal law, and requires police to make an attempt, when practicable, to determine a person's immigration status if there is reasonable suspicion that the person is an illegal alien, during a police stop for some other offense. Palin has since endorsed Arizona Governor Jan Brewer's "Secure The Border – Support Arizona" campaign.
On the July 9, 2010, episode of "The O'Reilly Factor", Palin again indicated support for a path to citizenship but clarified that illegal aliens should not be "rewarded for bad behavior": "We won’t complicate it any more. Let’s keep it simple, and let’s say, ‘No, if you are here illegally and you don’t follow the steps that at some point through immigration reform we’re going to be able to provide, and that is to somehow allow you to work. If you’re not going to do that, then you will be deported. You will be gone." Palin emphasized that more border enforcement should come first and said that current attempts at reform should "learn from history", with reference to the amnesty granted by Ronald Reagan, which she believed was "botched".
On June 1, 2011, Palin stated her opposition to the DREAM Act, a bill that would provide conditional permanent residency to certain illegal and deportable alien students who graduate from U.S. high schools, who are of good moral character, arrived in the U.S. legally or illegally as minors and have been in the country continuously for at least five years prior to the bill's enactment: "The immigrants in the past, they had to literally and figuratively stand in line and follow rules to become U.S. citizens. I'd like to see that continue, but unfortunately, the Dream Act kind of usurps that, the system, that is a legal system, to make sure that immigrants who want to be here legally, working hard, producing and supplying revenue and resources for their family, that they're able to do that right and legally. Unfortunately, the DREAM act doesn't accomplish that."
On June 15, 2013, Palin delivered an address at the Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference. She condemned the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 as a "pandering, rewarding-the-rule-breakers, still-no-border-security, special-interest-written amnesty bill." She also cautioned against supporting such a bill merely because Hispanic immigrants have higher fertility rates and said that there were other ways to "incentivize the hard-working, responsible families who want to be in the line, follow the law and become Americans, versus those whose very first act on our soil is to break the law."
Economic issues.
Palin describes herself as a fiscal conservative. At the Republican National Convention, Palin stated "I came to office promising to control spending – by request if possible and by veto if necessary... I suspended the state fuel tax, and championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress."
Shortly after becoming governor, Palin canceled a contract for the construction of an gravel road outside Juneau to a mine and sold the state's Westwind II jet, which had been purchased by the Frank Murkowski administration against the wishes of the Legislature. While governor, she slashed the state budget by $231 million for FY2008. The vetoes – which covered 36 spreadsheet pages – drew praise from those who believed the budget originally reflected too much spending, but anger from those who thought Palin went too far. The $231 million in cuts represented over 300 local projects including an expansion of the Port of Anchorage and the Fire Island wind energy project.
Bailout.
In September 2008, responding to Katie Couric's question asking if America can enter another Great Depression without the $700-billion bailout, Palin said, "Unfortunately, that is the road that America may find itself on. Not necessarily this, as it's been proposed, has to pass or we're going to find ourselves in another Great Depression. But, there has got to be action – bipartisan effort – Congress not pointing fingers at one another but finding the solution to this, taking action, and being serious about the reforms on Wall Street that are needed."
Earmarks.
While Palin was Mayor of Wasilla, the town paid a lobbying firm $24,000 to $36,000 per year to help secure federal earmarks for the town. Palin herself went to Washington to ask for more earmarks from the state's congressional delegation. According to a review by Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan group, Wasilla (a town of 6,700 residents) benefited from $26.9 million in earmarks in Palin's final four years in office. According to reporting by ABC News, however, Wasilla only directly received $7.95 million, and the $26.9 million figure refers to the amount the entire Matanuska-Susitna Borough received.
In the 2005 budget year, Alaska governor Frank Murkowski had requested $550 million in earmarks. In 2008 budget year, Palin sought $256 million in earmarks, and for the 2009 budget Palin gave a list of 31 proposed earmarks, totaling $197 million, to Alaskan Senator Ted Stevens. For the fiscal year 2010 budget, the last one before her resignation, Palin requested eight earmarks worth $69.1 million.
Housing issues.
On September 6, 2008, Palin stated that the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have "gotten too big and too expensive to the taxpayers. The McCain-Palin administration will make them smaller and smarter and more effective for homeowners who need help."
Health care.
Palin supports free-market competition in health care, and laws allowing patients better access to medical pricing information. In 2008, Palin said she was considering incentives for employers to provide health insurance. She added that changes must also include citizens "choosing to take more personal responsibility" to be healthier. In a "Wall Street Journal" editorial, Palin argued in favor of a free-market approach to health care including deregulation, tort reform and "providing Medicare recipients with vouchers that allow them to purchase their own coverage." Palin's Healthcare Decisions Day proclamation in April 2008 stated that it was "designed to raise public awareness of the need to plan ahead for healthcare decisions, related to end of life care and medical decision-making whenever patients are unable to speak for themselves and to encourage the specific use of advance directives to communicate these important healthcare decisions."
Death panels.
Articles that Palin wrote and posted to her Facebook page include "Statement on the Current Health Care Debate" (August 7, 2009) and "Concerning the "Death Panels"" (August 12, 2009). She also mentioned death panels in a statement she made to the New York state Senate Aging Committee" and in a "Wall Street Journal" editorial, both dated September 8, 2009. Palin expressed her opinion of Obama’s plans for health care reform, stating in part in the first article:
In August 2009, Palin's spokesperson said that Palin's "death panel" statements referred to H.R. 3200 "Advance Care Planning Consultation" page 425. According to PolitiFact, "Palin seems to acknowledge that the counseling isn't explicitly mandatory, but that in practice it would be." PolitiFact concluded that "the end-of-life counseling sessions in the House bill are voluntary."
Palin told the media through her spokesperson and three posts to her Facebook page that statements about Ezekiel Emanuel were reasons for her death panel comments. These statements were first made by Betsy McCaughey, and were described by TIME as lacking context, and by PolitiFact and FactCheck as false euthanasia claims.
In early November 2009, Palin said that despite other's prior denials that it contained "death panels", the health care legislation voted on by the U.S. House of Representatives had a "provision mandating bureaucratic panels that will be calling the shots regarding who will receive government health care". In an interview with Barbara Walters, Palin acknowledged that none of the health care bills included the actual word pair; "No, death panel isn't there." In November 2009, when asked about how she came up with the term "death panels," Palin said, "To me, while reading that section of the bill, it became so evident that there would be a panel of bureaucrats who would decide on levels of health care, decide on those who are worthy or not worthy of receiving some government-controlled coverage. Since health care would have to be rationed if it were promised to everyone, it would therefore lead to harm for many individuals not able to receive the government care. That leads, of course, to death." Palin also clarified that, "The term I used to describe the panel making these decisions should not be taken literally."
Palin later said that revisions of medical guidelines for cervical and breast cancer brought to mind "rationed care", and she questioned "what Washington has in mind with a government-controlled takeover of a health care system".
Social Security.
On October 6, 2010, Palin spoke with reporters and fielded a question about Social Security. She stated, "are going to have to make some tough decisions today. Thomas Paine, one of our Founders, had said, 'If there is to be trouble, let it be in my day, so that my child may have peace.' What he meant way back then was that there should be an expectation that some sacrifices will have to be made, in our generation, so that future generations can have the opportunities that we've had to grow and thrive and prosper, so that our private sector can do what a private sector does best in creating jobs. So, yeah, with some practical things that have to be made, some decisions here, with perhaps changing, in future years, not adversely affecting those who are reliant on retirement benefits today, for instance, Social Security benefits, but changing, perhaps, the eligibility in future years. That has to be something that we're brave enough, courageous enough, to start talking about."
Taxes.
In a September 18, 2008, speech at Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Palin said, "Our opponents, they have some strange ideas about raising taxes. To them, raising taxes – and Joe Biden said it again today – raising taxes is about patriotism. To the rest of America, that's not patriotism. Raising taxes is about killing jobs and hurting small businesses and making things worse. This isn't about anyone's patriotism – it's about Barack Obama's poor judgement."
As mayor, using income generated by a two percent sales tax that was enacted prior to her election, Palin cut property taxes by 75 percent and eliminated personal property and business inventory taxes. Palin also supported a voter-approved city sales tax increase of 0.5 percent to pay for a new sports complex. As governor, Palin helped pass a tax increase on oil company profits, although she opposed the Windfall Profits Tax proposed by Senator Barack Obama.
Energy and environment.
Department of Energy.
Palin told "Newsweek" that she favors revamping or even eliminating the United States Department of Energy, along with other Cabinet-level departments, in order to reduce the Federal debt. "That’s the kind of grand reform that is very, very difficult to do. But it can be done," she said.
Natural gas pipeline.
In June 2008, Palin stated that she would work to create jobs by building a pipeline to bring North Slope natural gas to North American markets. In her acceptance speech at the GOP in September 2008, Palin stated: "I fought to bring about the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history," "And when that deal was struck, we began a nearly $40 billion dollar natural gas pipeline to help lead America to energy independence." TransCanada projects the pipeline to be operational by late 2018, barring unforeseen obstacles.
Nuclear energy.
As part of her written comments in July 2009 regarding Obama's cap-and-trade energy plan, Palin included that "... every state can consider the possibility of nuclear energy". This includes new model nuclear reactors, such as those developed by Hyperion Power Generation, such as the deployment of a 225MW reactor for Alaska. Furthermore, she supports the overhaul of nuclear regulatory regime to allow the ready deployment of these new, smaller, nuclear reactors.
Oil and gas development.
As Governor, Palin has strongly promoted oil and natural gas resource development in Alaska, and advocates exposing the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, controverting McCain's position.
In an interview with "Time" in 2008, Palin argued that energy independence through ANWR drilling was essential to reducing American dependence on hostile foreign regimes. "We need to drill, drill, drill," she told the Wall Street Journal; she argues that "ANWR is only the size of the Los Angeles airport, and drilling there isn't environmentally destructive."
In order to assuage a fear that oil and gas development would be hampered by the listing of polar bears as a threatened species, Palin tried to sue the US government.
Palin told RealClearPolitics on May 31, 2011, that she supports the elimination of all energy subsidies, such those for ethanol: "I think that all of our energy subsidies need to be relooked at today and eliminated, and we need to make sure that we're investing and allowing our businesses to invest in reliable energy products right now that aren't going to necessitate subsidies because, bottom line, we can't afford it." She continued, "We've got to allow the free market to dictate what's most efficient and economical for our nation's economy. No, at this time, our country can't afford the subsidies. Before, though, we even start arguing about some of these domestic subsidies that need to be eliminated – should be – we need to look at ending subsidies and loans to foreign countries and their energy production that we're relying on, like Brazil."
Global warming.
After saying that global warming would affect Alaska more than any other state, Palin added: "I'm not one...who would attribute it to being man-made." But she has not completely ruled it out: "Show me where I have ever said that there's absolute proof that nothing that man has ever conducted or engaged in has had any effect or no effect on climate change. I have not said that."
On September 14, 2007, Palin signed an administrative order creating a Climate Change Sub-Cabinet charged with preparing a climate change strategy for Alaska. Palin ignored requests to establish an Alaska Office on Climate Change, an Alaska Climate Response Fund, and emissions reduction targets. Within her executive order, Palin described warming as a "global challenge" and sought "opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from Alaska sources, including the expanded use of alternative fuels, energy conservation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, land use management, and transportation planning." In April 2009 Palin acknowledged that "Simply waiting for low-carbon-emitting renewable capacity to be large enough will mean that it will be too late to meet the mitigation goals for reducing dioxide that will be required under most credible climate-change models." But in December 2009 she wrote, "any potential benefits of proposed emissions reduction policies are far outweighed by their economic costs."
Water.
While governor, Palin opposed The Alaska Clean Water Act stating that "very stringent regulations and policies already in place."
The Clean Water Initiative was voted on as Ballot Measure 4 on August 26, 2008, and lost by a vote of about 57 percent against and 43 percent for the measure. The measure was designed to impose higher water quality standards on a large scale mining operation, known as the Pebble Mine, near the Bristol Bay, which were designed to prevent pollution from entering some of the world's most productive Sockeye salmon runs. The Pebble Mine is primarily a large open pit mine which will extract copper and gold ore, resulting in runoff from the mine finding its way into salmon streams and drinking water, copper dust in particular being poisonous, even in low quantities, to fish.
Palin voiced her opposition to Measure 4, which, according to the Alaska constitution, could be construed as being unconstitutional, since a governor is not by law allowed to advocate either for or against any ballot measure. "Let me take my governor's hat off for just a minute here and tell you, personally, Prop 4- I vote no on that", she said. "I have all the confidence in the world that (the Department of Environmental Conservation) and our (Department of Natural Resources) have great, very stringent regulations and policies in place. We're going to make sure that mines only operate safely, soundly."
The Pebble Mine is a finite resource which will employ 5,500 people and bring $200 million in tax revenue a year to the state. Salmon fishing, a naturally renewable resource each year, employs 12,000 people in the Bristol Bay region alone and contributes $250 million each year to the economy. Many fishermen, environmentalists, naturalists, native Alaskans, residents and nature lovers, among many others, both in Alaska and worldwide, fear that pollution from the mine will destroy the salmon runs as well as the sometimes rare and very diverse wildlife that thrives there.
Overfishing.
On an April 13, 2012, appearance on "Stossel", Palin related how, as a commercial fisherman, she saw firsthand how Japanese fishing trawlers were responsible for "pretty much raping the bottom of the ocean floor before there was strict regulation on overfishing, and these Japanese trawlers, with 20-mile long nets, being able to overfish and then waste the bycatch. The rest of us, as commercial fishermen, we sit there saying, 'Well, pretty soon, there's not going to be a species left for us to help feed the rest of the world.'" Host John Stossel referred to such abusive fishing practices as an example of the tragedy of the commons and suggested giving different groups private rights over different parts of the ocean.
Predator control.
In 2007, Palin supported the Alaska Department of Fish and Game policy allowing Alaska the hunting of wolves from helicopters as part of a predator control program intended to increase moose and caribou populations. The Program has come under criticism and legal actions from wildlife activists stating the purpose of the program is to increase the numbers of prey species to unsustainable levels for sport hunters, residents and non-residents of Alaska.
In May 2007, Palin introduced Bill 256 to streamline the Predator Program and make it more difficult for conservation groups to sue the State. Critics of the Bill claimed it removed scientific standards and claimed the programs are expensive and not effective.
Endangered species.
Polar bears.
In December 2007, Palin wrote an opinion column in which she described her opposition to the listing of polar bears as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. In it she also stated that the polar bear population is more numerous now than 40 years ago and "there is insufficient evidence of polar bears becoming extinct in the foreseeable future". After Dirk Kempthorne, the Republican Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior listed the bear as threatened on May 14, 2008, Palin (representing the state of Alaska) sued the federal government, claiming that the listing would adversely affect energy development in the bears' habitat off Alaska's northern and northwestern coasts, while again questioning the scientific basis for the listing.
Palin claimed that scientists found no ill effects of global warming on the polar bear, a claim disputed by Alaskan state scientists and environmental groups.
Beluga whales.
Palin opposed strengthening protections for beluga whales in Alaska's Cook Inlet. She cited state scientists who claimed that hunting was the only factor causing the whales' decline and that the hunting had been effectively controlled through cooperative agreements with Alaska Native organizations. Recent research states that hunting controls have halted the decline of beluga whales in Cook's Inlet but that the population remains severely depleted and at high risk of extinction. Federal scientists do not attribute the decline in the Cook Inlet beluga population to human pollution. The Cook Inlet Beluga Whale was declared an endangered species by the Bush Administration on October 17, 2008.
Defense.
On her first trip overseas, Palin visited Alaskan troops deployed to Iraq; told how much they missed hunting and fishing, she signed a law in June 2008 that grants free hunting, trapping and fishing licenses to members of the Alaska National Guard and reserve.
As Governor of Alaska, Palin criticized proposed Obama administration cuts to missile defense programs, in response to North Korea's April 5, 2009 rocket test. In May 2009, North Korea conducted a series of short-range missile tests. Military experts believe a long-range missile could reach Alaska, where part of the United States' missile defense system is located. Palin called for the full restoration of Missile Defense Agency funding "to guarantee our protective measures remain the best in the world." The Defense Department had recommended not moving forward with a planned expansion of the missile defense system at Fort Greely in that year's budget. Palin disagreed: "Fort Greely plays a crucial role in the nation's security."
In a September 23, 2009, speech in Hong Kong, Palin said that "we need to maintain a strong defense" even in our current economic difficulties. She expressed her opposition to ending production of the F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft and C-17 cargo aircraft.
Don't Ask, Don't Tell.
During an interview on February 7, 2010, "Fox News Sunday" host Chris Wallace asked Palin if she supported repeal of "don't ask, don't tell", the United States military policy which restricts efforts to discover or reveal closeted gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members or applicants, while barring those who are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service. Palin responded, "I don't think so right now. I was surprised that the President spent time on that in his State of the Union speech when he only spent about 9 percent of his time in the State of the Union on national security issues. And I say that because there are other things to be worried about right now with the military. I think that kind of on the back burner is sufficient for now. To put so much time and effort and politics into it – unnecessary."
Foreign policy.
Afghanistan.
Palin believes that "We can win in Afghanistan" and "we must do what it takes to prevail. The stakes are very high." She urged Obama to "devote the resources necessary in Afghanistan" and pledged to support him if he made the "right" decision.
Iraq.
Palin supported the Bush Administration's policies in Iraq, but was concerned that "dependence on foreign energy" may be obstructing efforts to "have an exit plan in place".
Iran, Syria.
In the September 2008 CBS interview, Palin criticized Barack Obama for saying he would meet with leaders of Syria and Iran without preconditions. Reminded by the interviewer that Henry Kissinger, whom Palin had recently met, supports direct diplomacy with both countries, Palin responded: "I've never heard Henry Kissinger say, 'Yeah, I'll meet with these leaders without preconditions being met.' " Five days earlier Kissinger had made a televised statement of his position regarding Iran: "I am in favor of negotiating with Iran... I do not believe that we can make conditions for the opening of negotiations." However, Kissinger does not advocate negotiations at the presidential level.
During the 2008 vice-presidential debate on October 2, 2008, Palin stated that "A leader like Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is not sane or stable when he says things like that, is not one whom we can allow to acquire nuclear energy, nuclear weapons." She also further criticized Obama's proposal in 2007 to meet with Ahmadinejad without preconditions, stating that such an action "is downright dangerous because leaders like Ahmadinejad, who would seek to acquire nuclear weapons and wipe off the face of the Earth an ally like we have in Israel, should not be met with without preconditions and diplomatic efforts being undertaken first."
In her June 2013 address to the Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference, Palin declared her opposition to American involvement in the ongoing Syrian civil war: "Militarily, where is our Commander-in-Chief? We’re talking now more new interventions. I say, until we know what we’re doing, until we have a Commander-in-Chief who knows what he’s doing, well, Chief, in these radical Islamic countries who aren’t even respecting basic human rights, where both sides are slaughtering each other as they scream over an arbitrary red line, ‘Allah Akbar,’ I say, until we have someone who knows what they’re doing, I say, let Allah sort it out!" "Allah Akbar" is usually translated "God is Great" and used in various contexts by Muslims; "Allah" is the Arabic word for God.
Israel.
In a meeting on September 2, 2008, with leaders of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobby, Palin stated that she would "work to expand and deepen the strategic partnership between U.S. and Israel." Following the meeting, an AIPAC spokesman stated that Palin had "expressed her deep, personal, and lifelong commitment to the safety and well-being of Israel." Palin also stated, in reference to a possible nuclear threat from Iran, that: "Let there be no doubt: I will always keep the threat of military action on the table to defend our security and our ally Israel.",
In an interview with ABC News anchor Charles Gibson, Palin stated that she would not "second-guess" Israeli military action against Iran.
During the 2008 vice-presidential debate, Palin expressed support for a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, pledged to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and reiterated her support for Israel's survival. Specifically, Palin stated that "Israel is our strongest and best ally in the Middle East. We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust, despite, again, warnings from Iran and any other country that would seek to destroy Israel, that that is what they would like to see. We will support Israel. A two-state solution, building our embassy, also, in Jerusalem, those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish, with this peace-seeking nation, and they have a track record of being able to forge these peace agreements." Regarding Joe Biden's support for Israel, Palin stated that "I'm so encouraged to know that we both love Israel, and I think that is a good thing to get to agree on, Senator Biden. I respect your position on that."
In November 2009, Palin expressed her support for the expansion of Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories, a position contrary to that of every U.S. Presidential administration in the past 40 years. In an interview with Barbara Walters, Palin stated, "I believe that the Jewish settlements should be allowed to be expanded upon, because that population of Israel is going to grow. More and more Jewish people will be flocking to Israel in the days and weeks and months ahead. And I don't think that the Obama administration has any right to tell Israel that the Jewish settlements cannot expand."
On March 5, 2011, Palin stated that the United States should refrain from cutting off foreign aid to Israel, while eliminating "waste and fraud" and "inefficiencies": "I don't support that kind of foreign aid at all, but when it comes to Israel – No... I stand strong with Israel and unapologetically I say that America should keep this strong democratic ally that we have there in the Middle East and allow for protections around Israel."
On May 23, 2011, Palin reiterated her opposition to President Obama's statement that an independent Palestine be based on the borders of 1967, before the Yom Kippur War in which Israel occupied East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Palin questioned whether Obama's call for a "sovereign and contiguous" Palestinian state could mean "carving Israel in half" and echoed "The Independent", which asked, "Was the President implying that the new improved Israel will border neither Jordan nor Egypt, as it does now? Would Palestine’s contiguous territory come at the expense of Israel’s? Would Israel get the Gaza Strip and the Mediterranean and Palestine get the Negev and a Red Sea port?"
Libya.
On February 22, 2011, Palin criticized what she felt was the Obama administration's slow response to Muammar Gaddafi's violent response to the 2011 Libyan civil war and said that "NATO and our allies should look at establishing a no-fly zone so Libyan air forces cannot continue slaughtering the Libyan people."
Palin has since been critical of Obama's handling of the United States' military role in the 2011 military intervention in Libya. On April 16, 2011, she said Obama "willfully ignored the will of the American people... when you got us into a third war for fuzzy and inconsistent reasons, a third war that we cannot afford." She further criticized him on April 26, demanding Obama "step up and justify our Libyan involvement, or Americans are going to demand you pull out." She continued, "Simply put, what are we doing there? You’ve put us in a strategic no man’s land. If Gaddafi’s got to go, then tell NATO our continued participation hinges on this: We strike hard and Gaddafi will be gone. If, as you and your spokesmen suggest, we’re not to tell Libya what to do when it comes to that country’s leadership, and if you can’t explain to Americans why we’re willing to protect Libyan resources and civilians but not Syria’s, Yemen’s, Bahrain’s, Egypt’s, Israel’s, etc., then there is no justification for U.S. human and fiscal resources to be spent."
Following the Battle of Tripoli, Palin celebrated Gaddafi's defeat but cautioned against "triumphalism" and warned that the future Libyan government might not be democratic. She supported "work through diplomatic means to help those who want democracy to come out on top." Palin also said the United States should not commit "troops or military assets to serve as peacekeepers or perform humanitarian missions or nation-building in Libya. Our military is already over-committed and strained, and a vaguely designed mission can be the first step toward a quagmire."
NATO, Russia, Georgia, and Ukraine.
Palin has said that the former Soviet states of Georgia and Ukraine should be admitted into NATO, and that if Russia invaded a NATO signatory country, the United States should be prepared to go to war in that country's defense.
Palin opposes New START, a bilateral nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation. She argued that the treaty is "one-sided" because it "actually requires the U.S. to reduce our nuclear weapons and allows the Russians to increase theirs." Palin further stated that the treaty's link between offensive and defensive weapons "virtually guarantees that either we limit our missile defenses or the Russians will withdraw from the treaty."
Foreign aid.
Palin criticized President Obama for committing $2 billion to Egypt's new government as part of a $20 billion aid package pledged at the 37th G8 summit to Arab Spring states. She noted Egypt's "history of corruption when it comes to utilizing American aid" and the possibility of the Muslim Brotherhood taking the reins of Egypt's government. "Throwing borrowed money around is not sound economic policy. And throwing borrowed money around the developing world is not sound foreign policy," Palin said. "Foreign assistance should go to American allies that need it and appreciate it, and for humanitarian purposes when it can truly make a difference."

<doc id="19097990" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19097990" title="Michael Lee White">
Michael Lee White

Michael Lee White (born 1967) is a business and English teacher and writer who resides in China. In August 2008 the Russian government implied that he may be a covert agent of the United States or Military Professional Resources involved in the 2008 South Ossetia war, a claim that the White House has repeatedly denied.
Biography before controversy.
White was born in 1967, the second son of Philip L. White, later a Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Texas at Austin. White served in the United States Army from 1992 to 1997 as a Petroleum Supply Specialist in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Germany, and Bosnia. He fueled helicopters, drove fuel trucks, and, according to a resume posted online, he graduated from Air Assault training school in 1993. Although part of the curriculum of this school has included training in the application of infiltration and extraction techniques (such as Special Patrol Insertion Extraction), it is very common for soldiers with non-elite specialties to attend the ten-day course. This is especially true for soldiers stationed at Fort Campbell and assigned to the 101st Infantry Division (Air Assault), as this entire division is supposed to be able to perform helicopter air assault operations. After two years at Fort Campbell, White was transferred to the 1st Armored Division in Germany in 1994, where he continued to work as a fueler. The division was deployed to Operation "Joint Endeavor" in January 1996 as part of the multinational effort responsible for carrying out the Dayton Peace Accords. 
After his single term of enlistment, White earned a degree in Public Management at Austin Peay State University in Tennessee. He got his first teaching assignment in the Haidian District of Beijing in 1998. It was the first of many education-related travels around the world, including teaching stints in Kazakhstan, Vietnam, and Japan, in addition to graduate work in Development Studies at the University of Melbourne in Australia, and at the University of Essex in Colchester, and Communication, Psychology, and Business at Angelo State University in Texas. White also claims to have visited more than 85 countries, and all major regions of the world, while attending graduate classes or working on four different continents over the past 15 years. The "Wall Street Journal" reported that he married and later separated from a Kazakh citizen.
"Nationality in World History".
White has co-authored with his father a book entitled "Nationality in World History"; the work discusses the roots of nationalism and includes a chapter titled ["The Evolution of the Russian National Identity"]. According to White, "Nationality has caused major conflicts in world history. Much of what has passed for history through the ages concerns such nationalistic conflicts. Many works of contemporary history (political, constitutional, etc.) have been written in a ‘national’ context. It is not wise to simply hope or assume that a phenomenon that has dominated history so far will now simply fade away in the Information Age. "Nationality in World History" aims to help others understand the deeper phenomenon of why and how sovereign nations have been formed and maintained, from prehistory to the present day. We believe that understanding nationality in our species is helpful to attaining a peaceful and more civil future".
Passport controversy.
On August 28, 2008, Col. Gen. Anatoliy Nogovitsyn gave a news conference in Moscow, where he produced a photocopy of an American passport belonging to a Michael Lee White who was born in 1967 and lived in Texas. "The Wall Street Journal" did locate and interview him in Guangzhou, China, on September 2, 2008. White told the "Journal" that he was in Texas caring for his ailing father during the period when Russia alleged that he was in Georgia. The "Journal" says that White showed reporters two U.S. passports in his possession, one issued in 2005 and one issued in 2008. Although U.S. passports typically have a ten-year validity, no explanation is given in the article as to why he has two in his possession. The Associated Press interviewed him the next day, on September 3, and reported that White said he could not show his passport to the AP because university officials who are helping him apply for a work permit have the document. The Office of National Intelligence, which oversees all U.S. intelligence agencies, refused to comment on White, and the Central Intelligence Agency stated that White was not their employee. White claims, and the United States Department of State confirms, that he contacted the authorities immediately in 2005 to report the loss of his passport and that the passport was canceled. White said that he must have left it in a seat pocket on a Moscow to New York flight in October 2005. His current passport shows he left China on July 18, 2008, returning on August 28. The "Wall Street Journal" says there is no entry stamp in the passport from U.S. authorities to show that he returned to the United States during those 41 days, but that sometimes U.S. authorities do not mark the passports of returning Americans. White also told AP that he applied for a Russian visa while teaching in Kazakhstan in the summer of 2005.
Col. Gen. Anatoly Nogovitsyn said that Russian military discovered a passport in a building where Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs forces had been fighting. Nagovitsyn said,
What was the gentleman’s purpose of being among the special forces and what he is doing today, I so far cannot answer..there is a building in Zemonekozi - a settlement to the south of Tskhinvali that was fiercely defended by a Georgian special operations squad. Upon clearing the building, Russian peacekeepers recovered, among other documents, an American passport in the name of Michael Lee White of Texas...I do not know why he was there, but it is a fact that he was in the building, among Georgian special forces troops. 
On August 31, an Austin, Texas-based newspaper reported that on August 29 the U.S. State Department phoned Austin resident John White, White's younger brother, asking how they could contact Michael, stating that it was "urgent that we speak with him". When asked why, the official said that he could not discuss the matter. John White said his brother was a world traveler who had gone to China on August 27, 2008, and that he last contacted his family Saturday evening by e-mail.
The newspaper also reported that it had email conversation on August 30 with Michael Lee White who is apparently in Guangzhou, China, lecturing at the Guangdong University of Business Studies. He said that his passport was lost/stolen during a flight from Moscow to New York in 2005 and that he had no idea how the passport ended up in South Ossetia.
Alexei Kondaurov, a KGB veteran and critic of the Kremlin is quoted as saying that 'using a 'found' passport to expose the Americans seems really small-time". He added, "the Soviet Union's secret services never stooped that low".
Foreign media coverage.
White was interviewed by Guangzhou's leading newspaper, "Southern Metropolis Daily", on September 4, for whom he provided a computer image of the lost/stolen passport in question, in addition to a family photo of his father's 85th birthday party from July 31 in Austin, Texas. The English-language publication "Shenzhen Daily" also ran a story the same day. A "Russian Newsweek" interview with White from September 8 appears not to support the Russian government's accusation, and other Russian sites have noted the U.S. State Department's confirmation of White's claim that the passport was reported lost/stolen and canceled in October 2005. Russian state television Channel One (ORT), however, appears to have repeated the government's innuendos against White in a September 14, 2008 broadcast. Several weeks later, an October 2008 article in the Chinese weekly "Southern Weekly" summarized the chronology of events.

Sta. Rosa Catholic School

Sta. Rosa Catholic School (SRCS) is a school located in Pasig City, the Philippines.
History.
The school originated as the "Sta. Rosa de Lima Learning Center", founded in 1981-1982 by Monsignor Danilo J. Pascual, then Parish Priest of Sta. Rosa de Lima Parish and began in the converted church basement of Sta. Rosa de Lima Parish. The preschool was blessed on June 21, 1981 with Mr. and Mrs. Virgilio Melendres as its main sponsors, and St. Paul College, Pasig donating the furniture.
The name changed.
On April 20, 1985, a new two-room school building was blessed, through the efforts of the late Monsignor Isidro L. Jose, also a former parish priest and the generous donations of parishioners and friends. The learning center was renamed the "Sta. Rosa Parochial School" in 1988, with Mrs. Teresita Mateo appointed as the grade school coordinator. The building was then converted into a four-room school building through the initiative of the late Monsignor Jose and the school principal, Ms. Belen B. Ramos.
The present school.
At a meeting of the Board of Trustees on August 7, 2001, the school was registered as "Sta. Rosa Catholic School".

7.62 cm Infanteriegeschütz L/16.5

The 7.62 cm Infanteriegeschütz L/16.5 was an infantry gun used by Germany in World War I. 
German field guns had proven too heavy to accompany the infantry in the assault and the Germans resorted to a variety of solutions in an effort to find something that could help the infantry deal with bunkers and other obstacles. Enormous numbers of Russian 7.62 cm Model 1910 Putilov fortress guns had been captured early in the war and Krupp was told to adapt them for use as infantry guns. They mounted the barrel and breech of the Russian guns on a new solid box-trail carriage with two narrow seats behind the gunshield, facing to the rear. The gun retained its extraordinary depression of -18.6°, which was a legacy of its original purpose to fire down into fortress ditches, although its limited elevation prevented it from ranging past without digging in the trail. It used captured Russian canister ammunition for short-range engagements, but Rheinmetall manufactured its HE shell.
It proved to be popular with its crews, who appreciated its light weight, accuracy and good effect of the shell. Unfortunately the gun wore out quickly due to the poor-quality steel used by the Russians, and this degraded its accuracy significantly. In their desire to save weight, Krupp had lightened the carriage a bit too much and it proved to be rather fragile in normal use. The "7.7 cm Infanteriegeschütz L/20" was intended to rectify its shortcomings, but it remained in use for the remainder of the war.

Tui Railway Station

Tui railway station was a rural railway station that served the small farming settlement of Tui in the Tasman District of New Zealand’s South Island. It was one of 25 stations on the Nelson Section, and lasted from 1912 to 1955.
Facilities at this station included: stockyards, accessed via a 22-wagon backshunt; two loops, having a 37 and 27 wagon capacity respectively; a station building; a main goods shed with dimensions of and a second smaller goods shed; a loading bank; an outhouse; a railway house (for many years occupied by the local surfaceman); and a water vat.
History.
Tui station was opened along with the Kiwi to Glenhope section of the line on 2 September 1912, the date the Public Works Department handed control over to the Railways Department. This section became the last section of the line for most of the life of the Nelson Section, with Glenhope remaining the terminus for all but five years of its operation.
The area in which the station was located was originally known as Mana, and was home to several sawmills. Much of the verdant growth was cleared so farms could be established on the land. While initially successful, these farms eventually proved to be uneconomic.
One of the more prominent local facilities was a school, which opened the same year as the railway and lasted until amalgamation with the nearby Tapawera school in 1942. This proved to be an unpopular move with local parents of school-aged children, until they were mollified by the decision of the last teacher to work at the school to remain in the area and drive a school bus to and from Tapawera.
With the increasing popularity of motor cars in the early 20th century, the plan for the Tui area included the construction of a road overbridge at the southern end of the station yard to safely convey traffic for the upper Sherry River valley over the railway line. The bridge was completed with no problems in 1909. About along Tui Road from its junction with the main highway nearest the station, the road turned left to cross the overbridge. On the other side of the bridge, the road rounded a 90-degree right-hand curve to pass behind the station yard before turning left again to cross the river.
This station was closed for three days in June 1954 until the Nelson Section was granted a reprieve, and closed permanently on 3 September 1955.
Today.
The road overbridge at the southern end of the yard has been removed, and Tui Road now runs straight through where it used to turn left towards the bridge. At the northern end of the former station yard, the road curves left and heads towards the river.
Tui station was one of the longest surviving and best preserved of the former Nelson Section stations still on its original site. The station building and smaller goods shed remained in situ until 2006 when they were donated to the Nelson Railway Society and moved to Founders Park, Nelson for restoration. The Society received a Merit Award at the 2008 FRONZ Conference for their work on this restoration project. The restored station was officially reopened at a ceremony on Saturday, 16 August 2008.

List of Elvis Presley international hit singles

This is a list of international hit singles by Elvis Presley. The charts from the UK and other countries are explored in detail. How many hit singles an artist has had is an important measure of the artist's success and popular impact, though it is by no means the only measure. Elvis Presley had a worldwide impact on popular music and culture, as shown through his success on pop music charts throughout the world. His international success is even more remarkable considering that except for three 1957 Canadian concerts, Elvis did not perform outside of the United States.
While most of the international singles are the same as those that were released in the US, there are some singles that were international hits that were not hits in the US, such as “Party” and “Wooden Heart”.
International Singles and Chart Information.
Abbreviations for charts:
The numbers below represent the highest position for a song on each respective chart. 45 rpm singles were normally released with one song on each side, The "A-side" was generally considered to be the primary side, while the "B-side" or "flip-side" was considered secondary. Elvis frequently had both sides become hits and appear on the charts. The sides and their chart positions are distinguished by a " / ", A-side / B-side. Extended Plays (EP) usually had two songs per side and would sometimes make the singles chart. The numbers in parentheses are the number of weeks that a song remained at number 1.
1956-1958.
Some countries did not develop recognized, national charts until the 1960s.
1958-1964.
Elvis Presley returns from US Army duty in 1960. The focus of much of his work after his return is on his movie career and recording associated soundtracks.
1964-1967.
After The Beatles' rise to worldwide fame in 1964, Elvis' chart performance falls off.
1968-1977.
Elvis begins his musical comeback in late 1968 with his NBC TV Special. In 1973 his "Aloha from Hawaii" TV special is broadcast worldwide and seen by more than 1 billion viewers. He dies in 1977. Soon after his death, another TV special, "Elvis In Concert" is broadcast in the US.
1978-1999.
After Elvis' death numerous singles were re-released or remixed and released.
2000-present.
Elvis experiences a resurgence in popularity after the release of “Elv1s 30 Number 1 Hits” CD and the "A Little Less Conversation" remix in 2002, the 25th anniversary of his death. In anticipation of the expiration of the European copyrights on Elvis’ early recordings, BMG re-releases many of Elvis’ singles on CD. "Billboard" begins publishing a European Hot 100 singles chart (EUR).

Finality (law)

Finality, in law, is the concept that certain disputes must achieve a resolution from which no further appeal may be taken, and from which no collateral proceedings may be permitted to disturb that resolution. For example, in some jurisdictions, a person convicted of a crime may not sue their defense attorney for incompetence or legal malpractice if the civil lawsuit would call into question the finality of the criminal conviction. Finality is considered to be important because, absent this there would be no certainty as to the meaning of the law, or the outcome of any legal process.
The importance of finality is the source of the concept of "res judicata" - that the decisions of one court are settled law, and may not be retried in another case brought in a different court.

Fred L. Schiele

Fred Lyle Schiele, Sr., known also as Buddy Schiele (November 28, 1933 – January 24, 2002), served from 1964–1968 as a United States Democratic Party member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from Concordia Parish in the eastern portion of the state adjacent to the Mississippi River. He did not seek reelection in the 1967 primary election but instead unsuccessfully opposed incumbent Sheriff Noah W. Cross. On April 6, 1973, Schiele (pronounced SHE LEE) was appointed sheriff by Governor Edwin Washington Edwards, pending a special election, after Cross was forced to resign after twenty-five years in office because of the failure of the appeal of his federal conviction of perjury. Edwards settled on Schiele because the two had been legislative colleagues, and Schiele managed Edwards' 1971–1972 gubernatorial campaign in Concordia Parish. 
Schiele was one of four sons born in Vidalia, the parish seat of Concordia Parish, to Catesby Edward Schiele and the former Lucille Rountree (1897–1977). He graduated in 1951 from Vidalia High School. In 1981, at the age of forty-eight, he procured his bachelor’s degree in business administration from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Prior to his involvement in politics, Schiele ran a cotton gin in Ferriday, the other principal city of Concordia Parish. He also served on the board of First Federal Savings and Loan in Vidalia. 
In 1954, Schiele married the former Maxine Smith (born July 15, 1937), a 1955 graduate of Vidalia High School. The couple had five children: Fred Schiele, Jr. (born 1955), a former deputy sheriff for his father and the appointed chief of police in Ferriday chief of police, who later entered the trucking business in Dallas; Carole Ann Schiele Rice (born 1960) and Patricia Leigh Schiele (born 1962), both of Loranger in Tangipahoa Parish; Alan Maxwell Schiele (born 1964), a deputy sheriff in East Baton Rouge Parish, and Steven Lowery Schiele, II (born 1975) of Port Vincent, a village in Livingston Parish. Steven is named for Steven Schiele, I, a first cousin who was killed in an automobile accident in 1971. There were also three grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
Schiele won a full term in the 1975 election, but he was unseated in 1979 by fellow Democrat John Patrick, an insurance agent. He then completed his college degree and was employed thereafter by the Probation and Paroles section of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety. Schiele attempted a comeback in 1987, when he challenged incumbent Sheriff Hubert Lee McGlothin (1940–2004), who had previously been the mayor of Ferriday. In the 1987 contest, Schiele polled 1,155 votes (12.8 percent). McGlothin resigned midway in his second term as sheriff as a result of a criminal conviction. The Concordia Parish Police Jury, the parish governing body, then appointed Randy Maxwell, effective August 31, 1990, to serve until a special election was held on March 21, 1991. In that all-Democrat contest, Maxwell defeated Schiele, 4,619 (62.9 percent) to 1,900 (25.9 percent). Two other candidates shared the remaining 11.3 percent of the vote. Maxwell was unopposed in the regular jungle primary for sheriff on October 19, 1991, and has since remained in the position though he has had close elections.
The probation and paroles division relocated the Schieles to Alexandria, where he died of a massive heart attack at the age of sixty-eight. He was Methodist. After her husband’s death, Mrs. Schiele, a native of Natchez, Mississippi, moved to Loranger to be near her two daughters. Schiele, like Sheriff Cross his predecessor, is buried in the Natchez City Cemetery across the Mississippi River from Vidalia.

Wynnewood, Dallas

Wynnewood is one of the main neighborhoods of Oak Cliff, the southwestern part of Dallas, Texas. Wynnewood covers that are bordered, roughly, by the Dallas Area Rapid Transit railway line to the north, Zang Boulevard to the east, Kiest Boulevard to the south, and Polk Street to the west.
History.
The history of Wynnewood is inextricably connected with the development of suburban living in post-World War II America. Indeed, Wynnewood is the southern equivalent of famous Levittown, New York, a planned community with which Wynnewood is exactly contemporaneous. But the parallels do not end there.
Just as Levittown was named after Levitt and Sons, the company that planned and built the suburb, so Wynnewood carries the name of the Wynne family. The that were to become Wynnewood were originally purchased in 1913 by the American Home Realty Company, but remained undeveloped until the 1940s; at that point the company was acquired by Toddie Lee Wynne, Sr., and Benjamin Hick Majors. When Wynne’s nephew Angus Gilchrist Wynne, Jr., returned from the war, he was appointed president of American Home Realty. His task was to take advantage of the post-war boom, which created a propitious time for housing development.
Construction took place in several phases. It started in March, 1946, in the triangle marked by Illinois, Bristol, and Garapan. The very first homes to be completed were those on Veasy Street (later renamed Wynnewood Drive). The first resident to occupy a Wynnewood home was J. D. Jones of 2342 Veasy. The entire development was largely complete by 1954.
Conception of the “City of Wynnewood, U.S.A.”.
Angus Wynne and his architect, Roscoe DeWitt, conceived of Wynnewood as “one-self-contained community,” as the American Home Realty Company declared in a contemporary advertisement. In fact, another contemporary ad referred to the “City of Wynnewood, U.S.A.” Of course, the Wynnewood community did not grow organically over decades or even centuries, like traditional cities; it reflected the carefully thought-out blueprint of its creators. Wynnewood was to consist of 2,200 homes and 1,000 apartments, with a large shopping area at their center. The homes cost between $6,000 and $20,000, thus ranging from rather modest floor plans in the original core of Wynnewood to upscale residences in Wynnewood North. The mix of apartments and homes in different price ranges ensured a certain socio-economic diversity; racial diversity, on the other hand, was not yet conceivable: the community was initially all-white.
In Wynnewood, Wynne and DeWitt attempted to marry the principles of mass production with individuality. In Wynnewood, one would not find “regimented rows upon rows of houses, dreadful uniformity.”. Indeed, the homes in the Wynnewood community have a sufficient diversity of styles and layouts not to appear like “cookie-cutter” houses. Nevertheless, they were built with great efficiency, from components manufactured in specially established “pre-fabrication mills.” A contemporary article describes the work method of the construction teams in the following words:
Employing nearly 300 workers, one-third of whom are carpenters, the contractors have their forces set up in skilled groups specializing in their fields. For example, the employees include groups such as wall erection, rafter erection, frame gables, window and door frames. The groups start down a street in the addition, taking each house in order, and with the completion of their repetitive work on that street, cross over and return down the next street, working much on the order of an assembly line. Following are brick masons who are equipped to complete one house daily.
Great emphasis was placed on the quality of workmanship. For example, the electric wiring in the Wynnewood community followed the standards of the “Dallas Adequate Wiring Committee,” set up to promote the kind of wiring that would be able to handle the expanding use of electricity for household appliances.
The streets at the core of Wynnewood are named after WWII Navy commanders, ships, and battles: for example, Eisenhower, Salerno, Nicholson, Garapan, Anzio, Grayson, O’Banion, and Bristol. This reflects Angus Wynne’s Navy career. DeWitt Circle commemorates the architect.
Wynnewood Shopping Village.
Unlike modern-day developers, who often fail to provide neighborhoods with the facilities necessary for everyday life, Wynne and his advisers planned a large shopping center at the heart of their community. Begun in the summer of 1947, by 1954 the Wynnewood Shopping Village had expanded to 150 shops on with 6,400 parking spaces. There were a movie theater, a post office, the Wynnewood State Bank, department stores, grocery stores, drug stores, restaurants, furniture and jewelry stores, doctors’ offices—even a hotel. What made (and still makes) the Wynnewood Shopping Center unique is the fact that it is laid out like a “village”: shops are not crammed into one huge air-conditioned complex, but are housed in blocks of one-story buildings surrounded by trees.
Wynnewood Today.
Over the decades, Wynnewood has in some ways lost the identity that the founders were hoping to achieve in this particular community. (Many of the residents of Wynnewood North, however, engaged through their neighborhood association, still actively press to maintain the uniqueness of their distinctive neighborhood.) Yet Wynnewood has retained some of its original characteristics: it is still one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Dallas, not only in socio-economic but also in racial terms. The homes have turned out to be as solid as their creators promised. The tree-lined streets exude a sense of quietness and comfort. The apartments have become subsidized housing, with some of the problems attendant upon this type of dwelling. The most disappointing aspect in the recent history of Wynnewood is the fate of the shopping village, which is only a shadow of its former self. Many of its buildings have been razed: the Professional Building (which used to be occupied by doctors’ offices) is gone, as are the movie theater, the hotel, and the department stores. There have been discussions in recent years about reviving the shopping center, whose services are still badly needed by the community; but as of the fall of 2008, nothing has come of these discussions.<br>The following images give an impression of Wynnewood as it looks in 2008.

Troy Eid

Troy A. Eid, a former United States Attorney now in private law practice with Greenberg Traurig LLP in Denver, CO, is the Chair of the Indian Law and Order Commission [http://www.indianlawandordercommission.com/ This all volunteer blue-ribbon advisory panel was created by the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 to recommend changes to the President and Congress on strengthening public safety on Indian reservations throughout the United States. Eid, a Republican who was appointed as Colorado’s U.S. Attorney by President George W. Bush, was named to the Indian Law and Order Commission by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and unanimously elected Chair by its nine members in April 2011. The Commission released their full report "A Roadmap For Making Native America Safer" on Nov. 12, 2013. He is also an Adjunct Professor of Law at both the University of Colorado Law School and the University of Denver College of Law, where he teaches civil and criminal law with a focus on energy, natural resources, environmental regulation, and American Indian law.
Early career.
Troy Eid was born in 1963 in Chicago, Illinois to Edward and Sandra Eid. Edward Eid was an Egyptian who immigrated to the United States in 1957 with just $100. Troy was raised in Wheat Ridge, Colorado and graduated from Stanford University in 1986, majoring in Russian Language and Literature. At Stanford he was a research assistant for then-Associate Professor Condoleezza Rice. At graduation, Eid was awarded the prestigious John W. Gardner Fellowship, a joint Stanford-University of California at Berkeley award honoring the late John Gardner, the architect of the Great Society under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Eid was elected editor-in-chief of the student newspaper, "The Stanford Daily", and met his future wife, Allison Hartwell, while standing in line at a dorm cafeteria, where she was working as a food-service worker; she later said: "It was love at first sight in the meal card line." Eid graduated in 1986 and, along with Hartwell, attended the University of Chicago Law School, where he earned his law degree in 1991. Eid is admitted to practice law in Colorado and the Navajo Nation, and his legal practice has focused on environmental, natural resources and federal Indian law. He was elected to membership in the American Law Institute, and has been recognized as one of the country's top practicing attorneys in both American Indian Law and environmental law by "Chambers USA" and was named by "The Denver Post" as one of 2007's "People to Watch". He passed the Navajo Nation bar examination in 2005 and now chairs the Committee on Training for the Navajo Nation Bar Association, which is responsible for legal education and the semi-annual bar exam on the country’s largest Indian reservation.
Eid served as a law clerk to Edith Jones, Chief Judge of the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals before entering private law practice in 1992 at Holme Roberts & Owen in Denver. From 1994 to 1999, Eid served as general counsel and chief operating officer of the National Information Infrastructure Testbed, an Internet technology research consortium formed to prototype advanced Internet applications in such areas manufacturing, health care and environmental protection. In his capacity with the consortium, Eid directed engineering teams in North America, Europe and Asia.
Cabinet of Gov. Bill Owens.
From 1999 to 2003, Eid served in the cabinet of then-Colorado Governor Bill Owens. Owens first appointed him chief legal counsel, where he oversaw the appointment of 34 state judges. Eid also served as executive director for the Department of Personnel & Administration, where he was responsible for Colorado's workforce of 70,000. Within days of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, Eid was chosen to head an independent commission reviewing the Jefferson County law enforcement response. He also chaired the Colorado State's Board of Ethics, served on more than a dozen state boards during his time in Owens' cabinet and eventually served as chief administrative officer for Colorado's $13-billion state government. Owens described Eid as a model of integrity and uprightness while serving on the cabinet, and said of his work during that time, ""It's a trial by fire, and when you survive it, typically it means you're going to be a very good lawyer." In recognition of his reforms to the state personnel system, Eid—who co-chaired a statewide commission with former Colorado Governor Richard D. Lamm (D) focused on the future of the state workforce—was awarded the "Outstanding Governmental Official of the Year Award" by both the Denver Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in 2003.
Appointment to U.S. Attorney.
When Colorado U.S. Attorney John Suthers was appointed the state's attorney general in December 2004, Troy Eid was considered for his replacement, along with Larimer County District Attorney Stu VanMeveren and Arapahoe County District Attorney Jim Peters. Eid withdrew his name from consideration in January 2006, claiming the 13-month selection process was taking too long. Eid also withdrew in part because his wife, Allison Eid, was under consideration for the Denver-based Tenth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; the appointment would have created a conflict of interest since the U.S. Attorney oversees cases that often end up in the circuit court. Eid denied that his withdrawal had anything to do with Jack Abramoff, who had recently been fired from Greenberg Traurig and who was later sentenced to serve five years and ten months in prison on numerous fraud convictions. Eid insisted the fact that he had been selected for an internal ethics committee at the firm indicated that he didn't "have an Abramoff problem."
After withdrawing, Eid announced he would run for an at-large seat on the University of Colorado Board of Regents. In March 2006, Allison Eid was appointed Associate Justice on the Colorado Supreme Court, which removed the potential conflict because the U.S. Attorney does not get involved in state court matters. By that time, VanMeveren and Peters had also been removed from consideration for U.S. Attorney. When the White House asked for three more names, Senator Wayne Allard recommended only William Leone, who had been serving as acting U.S. Attorney since January 1, 2005. Leone, however, had been placed on a list of U.S. Attorneys to be fired for political reasons by Kyle Sampson, Chief of Staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, and the White House instead asked Eid to reconsider. White House officials did not consider any other candidates besides Eid, who suspended his campaign for the University of Colorado Board of Regents in order to accept the U.S. Attorney position.
Eid was appointed to the position by President George W. Bush on June 9, 2006, making him the 41st United States Attorney for the state of Colorado and the first Arab-American ever appointed to serve as a U.S. Attorney. Eid, who said he was "totally stunned" by the invitation, was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on August 4, 2006. He served as Colorado's chief federal criminal prosecutor and represented the United States in civil cases where the government was party to a lawsuit. When Eid started the position with about 2,500 civil and criminal cases among 120 people, which he described as one of the heaviest caseloads outside of Washington, D.C. In addition to the cases, Eid said his priorities upon assuming the office were enforcing immigration laws, cracking down on drug trafficking, and creating a cyber-crime unit to fight child solicitation and pornography. In his first few weeks on the job, Eid visited with local, state and federal law enforcement and met one-on-one with everybody on his approximately 140-person staff. The salary was about $142,000 a year.
Joseph Nacchio trial.
Eid was appointed as the United States Attorney for the District of Coloardo on June 9, 2006. Among the cases Eid inherited from his predecessor, acting U.S. Attorney Bill Leone, was the ongoing prosecution of Joseph Nacchio, the former chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Qwest Communications International indicted on 42 counts of insider trading. Nacchio was accused of selling $101 million of Qwest stock in the first five months of 2001 despite knowledge from company insider's that Qwest's financial condition was deteriorating. Leone had been lead prosecutor on the Nacchio case since 2002, but several members of the prosecution team had left throughout the years due to infighting that threatened to derail the case. Due to the problems with the Nacchio team and prior failures to achieve convictions against other Qwest employees, U.S. Department of Justice officials became concerned about the Denver office's ability to get a conviction and considered taking over the prosecution. Eid persuaded them otherwise in part by hiring Cliff Stricklin, who prosecuted the case against former Enron officials Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay in response to the Enron scandal. Although Stricklin was difficult to woo following his Enron success, Eid successfully hired Stricklin in August 2006 as First Assistant U.S. Attorney of Colorado and the head prosecutor for the Nacchio case
The prosecution team, which had about seven months to prepare for trial, also included Justice Department litigator Colleen Conry; Colorado Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Traskos; former tobacco litigation task force prosecutor Leo Wise; and Colorado Assistant U.S. Attorney James Hearty, the only prosecutor who served on Leone's original Qwest team. The prosecutors reportedly got along very well and heeded lessons from previous unsuccessful corporate fraud, which prompted Stricklin to describe them as "the very best team" he ever worked with. The trial began in March 2007 and in April, Nacchio was convicted of 19 of the 42 counts of insider trading. On July 28, he was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to pay a $19 million fine and forfeit the $52 million he grossed on the illegal sales. Eid described the Nacchio case as the largest insider trading case in United States history; regarding the verdict and sentencing, Eid said, "This is what the American criminal justice system is all about" and said, "'Convicted felon Joe Nacchio' has a very nice ring to it."
Nacchio appealed the verdict, arguing that then-federal Judge Edward Nottingham had improperly excluded a defense witness from offering expert evidence during the trial. In a two-to-one decision on March 17, 2008, the Tenth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned all 19 guilty counts and ordered a new trial before a different judge. Eid appealed the decision to the full appellate court, and recruited Edwin Kneedler, principal deputy solicitor general for the Department of Justice and a veteran Supreme Court attorney, to represent the government in the case; Eid said of Kneedler, "We wanted the best and we got him." In Feb. of 2009, an en banc panel of the Tenth Circuit reversed the previous panel's decision and reinstated all 19 convictions.
Operation Central.
Beginning in 2007, Eid oversaw the nationally recognized Operation Central, a successful joint U.S.-Mexican prosecution of criminal trafficking in endangered sea turtles. A three-year international investigation led to multiple arrests on charges of smuggling the skins of endangered sea turtles and other protected animals for use in making boots, belts and wallets. Eid described as "unprecedented" the cooperation between U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents and Mexican authorities.
Sea turtles are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, a multilateral treaty of which the U.S., Mexico and 170 other countries are parties.
In recognition of the success of Operation Central, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Department of Justice were later awarded the Animal Welfare Institute’s prestigious Clark R. Bavin Law Enforcement Award for this multi-year undercover investigation of unlawful international trafficking in sea turtle parts and products. The award was presented by Willem Wijnstekers, Secretary-General of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
Operation Central was the largest probe ever of the unlawful commercial exploitation of highly endangered sea turtles – all of which are listed under Appendix I of CITES which bans international trade. Operation Central was planned and designed to infiltrate two widely active segments of the black market wildlife trade – sea turtle skin and skin products moving illegally from Mexico to the United States and sea turtle shell and shell products being smuggled to the United States from China. The investigation also documented the role of U.S. retailers in the unlawful commercial exploitation of other CITES-listed species (including caimans and lizards) in the exotic boot trade. The government of Mexico coordinated enforcement activities with the Fish and Wildlife Service that also resulted in arrests in Mexico.
The Clark R. Bavin Wildlife Law Enforcement Awards are named in memory of the late Chief of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Office of Law Enforcement, who pioneered the agency's highly effective use of covert investigations and "sting" operations to uncover illegal wildlife trade. The awards have traditionally been presented by the Secretary-General of CITES during meetings of the Conference of the Parties.
Other U.S. Attorney service.
In August 2008, Troy Eid charged Marc Garold Ramsey, 39, for sending a threatening letter with a white powdery substance to 2008 Republican Party presidential nominee Senator John McCain. Although the powder was not lethal, Ramsey could face at least five years on charges of knowingly mailing a threat. Later that month, Eid also assessed an alleged assassination plot against then-Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, after alleged plotters Shawn Robert Adolf, Tharin Robert Gartrell and Nathan Johnson were arrested just prior to the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Although the trio were charged with drug and weapon charges, Eid declared that the racist statements the suspects made following their arrests had not risen to the legal standard that would have allowed the filing of federal charges for threatening a presidential candidate. At an August 26 press conference, Eid dismissed the trio as drug addicts and said the "meth heads were not a true threat to the candidate, the Democratic National Convention or the people of Colorado."
Eid was accused by some of showing a political bias by prosecuting Ramsey without charging Gartrell, Adolf and Johnson, but Eid defended the decision; in a letter responding to the criticism, he wrote, “It would have been disgraceful for me or any other prosecutor to charge someone for a crime he didn’t commit. ... There was no probable cause to support such a charge. To the extent you challenge my motives or those of the many investigating agents and career prosecutors who all reached this conclusion in this matter, you’re mistaken.” Eid aides admitted, however, that the decision not to charge was at least in part because they did not believe a jury would convict them based on the reliability of Johnson's testimony; Jeffrey Dorschner, Eid's spokesman, said a defense attorney “would tear him apart.”
Eid also focused extensively on Native American issues while serving as Colorado’s U.S. Attorney. He partnered with the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and the Director of its Justice Department, Janelle Doughty, to create a regional program to train tribal, state and local law enforcement officers to enforce federal criminal law on Indian reservations in Southwestern Colorado. This program later expanded to include officers from more than 35 Indian tribes from 17 states. Eid’s pilot program gained the attention of Senator Byron L. Dorgan, who praised it as a national success story in strengthening criminal justice in Indian Country and used it as the model for the bill’s expanded training provisions.
Resignation and Attorney General bid.
With the election of President Barack Obama, Eid was expected to be replaced as U.S. Attorney, as is the custom with a change of presidential administrations. On January 7, 2009, Eid announced he would resign as U.S. Attorney on January 19, the day before President Barack Obama's inauguration, and run for Colorado Attorney General in 2010. Eid sought to fill the position expected to be vacated by John W. Suthers, who was planning to run for governor or U.S. Senate. However, shortly after Eid's resignation, Suthers announced that he would seek re-election as attorney general rather than run for higher office. In response, Eid dropped plans to run for attorney general, describing Suthers as one of his close friends and claiming, "Challenging John is not part of my equation." Eid rejoined the private firm Greenberg Traurig, where he had worked from 2003 to 2006. Eid said he had not decided to seek any other office.
Support for S. 797 Tribal Law and Order Act of 2009 and Indian Law and Order Commission Service.
Eid testified before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in support of S. 797, the Tribal Law and Order Act on June 25, 2009. Introduced April 2, 2009, S. 797 is legislation aimed at amending the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act, the Indian Tribal Justice Technical and Legal Assistance Act of 2000, the Indian Tribal Justice Act and the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. A primary goal of S.797 is to improve the prosecution of crimes on Tribal Lands by filling the jurisdictional gap left when federal jurisdiction over tribal lands was removed in 1953 by Public Law 280. In his testimony, Eid cited examples of the jurisdictional complexity he encountered during his time as U.S. Attorney.
Eid testified in support of the Tribal Law & Order Act at the invitation of U.S. Senator Byron L. Dorgan. In July 2009, Dorgan wrote Eid: “Your continued dedication to Indian Country after your service to the United States is truly admirable.” Eid also worked extensively to support passage of the legislation. When the bill lacked sufficient votes in the U.S. House of Representatives, Eid and former U.S. Attorney Thomas Heffelfinger of Minnesota wrote a joint letter to Republican leaders urging its passage. In recognition of Eid’s efforts, The Denver Post wrote: “Special kudos to former U.S. Attorney Troy Eid, who worked tirelessly to bring justice to tribal lands”.
The Tribal Law and Order created the nine-member Indian Law and Order Commission, ILOC, which is responsible for reporting to the President and Congress by July 2012 on legal and policy recommendations to strengthen public safety in and near Indian reservations across the United States. Eid was appointed to the Commission by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) on December 23, 2010 and unanimously elected chair by the commission's members on April 6, 2011. After the Commission met with Indian tribes and Nations across the United States, including Alaska, and hearing from numerous tribal, state and federal leaders, and non-proft organizations, the Commission presented their full report on November 12, 2013. The report, titled "A Roadmap For Making Native America Safer", offers a broad range of recommendations intended to improve the criminal justice systems serving Native American and Alaskan Native communities.
On November 15, 2013, just days after presenting the Commission's report to Congress, Mr. Eid appeared on the Alaska Public Radio Network to debate the commission's findings with Alaska Attorney General Michael Geraghty. During the debate, which can be heard here, Mr. Eid emphasized the commission's recommendations that tribal governments should be given jurisdiction to self govern crime within their boundaries.
Mr. Eid appeared before a Senate Committee on Indian Affairs Oversight Committee on February 12, 2014 to reaffirm ILOC's recommendations and answer any questions. The full hearing can be seen here, or you can read Mr. Eid's testimony.
Family.
Eid is married to Allison Hartwell Eid, who was appointed an Associate Justice on the Colorado Supreme Court by then-Governor Bill Owens in February 2006. The Eids have two children together named Alex and Emily. Allison has described her husband as one who enjoys and embraces challenges; citing his decision to take the Navajo Nation's bar exam during his time as a private attorney, she said, "What 41-year-old man is going to willingly take the bar? He's just someone who jumps in and says, 'I'm going to meet this challenge.'"
Writings.
Eid wrote the article "Strategic Democracy-Building: How U.S. States Can Help" for "The Washington Quarterly" magazine, anthologized in the 2003 book, "Winning Hearts and Minds: Using Soft Power to Undermine Terrorist Networks." He also wrote a 2007 article for "The Federal Lawyer" entitled "Beyond Oliphant: Strengthening Criminal Justice in Indian Country."
Eid and one of his former students at CU Law School, Carrie Covington Doyle, co-authored an article concluding that the federal criminal justice system in Indian Country illegally discriminates against the rights of Native Americans in violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Among other things, Eid and Doyle noted that the punishments imposed on Native American offenders, especially juveniles, are systematically harsher than punishments for identical or very similar offenses committed by non-Indians.

A New Trick to Cheat the Devil

A New Trick to Cheat the Devil is an early seventeenth-century stage play, a comedy written by Robert Davenport that was first printed in 1639. One of only three surviving Davenport plays, it has been called an entertaining and extravagant farce.
Publication.
The play was first published in 1639, in a quarto printed by John Okes for the bookseller Humphrey Blunden. This was the only edition of the play prior to the nineteenth century.
The 1639 quarto includes a short preface, apparently written by the bookseller. This prefatory note describes the play as "an Orphant, and wanting the Father which first begot it..." This seems to indicate that Davenport was dead by 1639; but other evidence suggests that he was still alive. In the following year, two plays, Nathanael Richards's "Messalina" and Thomas Rawlins's "The Rebellion", were printed with commendatory poems written by Davenport. And the address "To the knowning Reader" prefixed to Davenport's "King John and Matilda" suggests that Davenport was still alive in 1655, when that play was first published.
Date.
No firm evidence on the play's date of authorship is extant. The earliest evidence for Davenport's career as a dramatist comes from 1624; the period from 1624 to its publication in 1639 has been regarded as the range of possible dates for "New Trick".
One curious feature is that the play contains a "yellow starch" reference. in Act IV, scene 1, the Devil says "I was first father to this yellow Sterch..." This is an allusion to the fashion for wearing ruffs and cuffs dyed yellow, which was strongly associated with Mistress Anne Turner, the woman executed for her role in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury on 15 November 1615. References to yellow starch and "yellow bands" are common in plays written in the 1615–18 years, but seem rather dated in a play from the 1620s or '30s. (The same dating conundrum applies to Davenport's other comedy, "The City Nightcap".) more data on yellow starch references, see: "The World Tossed at Tennis".
Devil and prodigal.
"New Trick" naturally belongs in at least two classes of English Renaissance play. It is a "prodigal son" drama, one of a long series of plays that trace the fall and recovery of a protagonist in the manner of the Biblical parable. It is also, as its title indicates, a devil play, a sub-genre that extended the influence of the Medieval morality play into English Renaissance theatre.
Earlier plays in the Devil sub-genre, like "Doctor Faustus" and "The Devil's Charter", presented the infernal influences as real aspects of the world. Later plays in the tradition, like "New Trick" or "The Soddered Citizen" (c. 1630), treat Satanic matters as spurious and fraudulent.
Sources.
As in his other plays, Davenport draws plot materials in "New Trick" from folklore and from previous dramas, more so than from the formal prose literature of his day. Uncertainty in the play's date makes it difficult, in many cases, to say which plays may have influenced Davenport's work, and in turn which plays might have been influenced by Davenport's work. Influence from Shakespeare is plain and evident; A passage in I,2 that is rich in classical allusions draws heavily upon Ovid.
The play's brief subplot also depends on folklore material. A version of the same story appears in a poem printed in Scotland in 1603 and 1622. Folktales in several traditions replicate similar plots.
Synopsis.
The play opens with its hero and heroine, Slightall and Anne Changeable; they are in love and plan to marry. Anne's father, Master Changeable, supports the match, but her social-climber harridan mother, Mistress Changeable, wants her daughter to wed an aristocrat, Lord Skales. The young and naive Anne is swayed by her mother's materialist temptations, and rejects Slightall for the lord. Slightall is crushed and devastated, and quickly lapses into spendthirft debauchery.
When she actually meets the lord, however, Anne is deeply disappointed; man for man, she much prefers Slightall, and is not shy about saying so. She seeks out Slightall to express her regret, but he is too deeply enmeshed in his heartbreak to respond. Anne, in deep psychological distress, reproaches everyone in her circle, father, mother, lordly future husband and others, for their faults; they think she has lost her reason.
Slightall mortgages his lands to an Usurer to gain funds to waste on self-indulgence. The Usurer tells his Scrivener how he conspires with Slightall's corrupt servant Geoffrey to drag Slightall down into bankruptcy. The Usurer's scenes allow Davenport to comment on the social and economic conditions of the day.
Slightall's bad servant Geoffrey is counterbalanced by a loyal servant, Roger, who stands by his master even when his formal employment has come to an end. Master Changeable is also a partisan in Slightall's cause. Anne's father arranges a complex charade: after a masque of infernal spirits dressed as a Beggar, a Whore, a Puritan and similar figures, Changeable himself masquerades as the Devil and draws Slightall into the standard infernal bargain. He, the "Devil," will provide financial support to Slightall in return for Slightall's soul. Slightall gains the funds to redeem his mortgages from the Usurer on the final day possible. The time comes for Slightall to pay the Devil his due: Mistress Changeable, Lord Scales, and others watch what they think is an infernal marriage, in which Slightall will marry a "shee Lamia," a succubus. Slightall actually marries Anne, to their own delight and the discomfiture of the rival party.
The drama's subplot is confined to a single long scene, III,1. Two friars, Bernard and John, pay a late-night call upon their friend, the Host of an inn. They seek shelter for the night. The Host is absent, and his wife the Hostess is ready to meet her lover, the local Constable, for a tryst. She is naturally unhappy with the presence of her visitors, and confines the two monks to an upper room. The humble Friar Bernard goes to sleep, but Friar John is disquiet; he spies on the Hostess through a chink, and sees the Constable arrive and lay out a tasty supper for the two of them. When the Host suddenly and unexpectedly returns, the Hostess hides the food and the Constable – all of which Friar John witnesses.
John makes enough noise to attract the attention of the Host, who is happy to greet his monkish friends. The Hostess, very dissatisfied, denies that there is any good cheer to be had in the house. The crafty John pretends to conjure the demon Asteroth to supply a magic meal; he exposes, item by item, the Constable's hidden delectables, which the Host and friars enjoy. Finally, John tells the Host that he will conjure the demon Asteroth in person, in the guise of the local Constable; the Host must not be fooled be this appearance, but must beat the demon soundly. Of course, the friar exposes the real Constable in his hiding place, and the Host gives the would-be adulterer a vigorous beating before the man escapes.

Quagmire is a neighbor and friend of the Griffin family and is best known for his hypersexuality. Creator and voice actor Seth MacFarlane describes Quagmire as "an appalling human being who is still caught in the rat-pack era" based on anachronistic 1950s party-animal clichés. His neighbor and close friend Peter Griffin describes him as a "heartless sex hound" and refers to him as "a rapist" in "The Cleveland Show". Quagmire is a commercial airline pilot. He has had two spouses: Joan, who was a maid that worked for the Griffins who died; and Charmise, who was a prostitute whom he divorced.
Origins and appearance.
The name "Quagmire" was chosen by a college acquaintance of MacFarlane's; the word quagmire refers to both a soft soil that yields easily (such as quicksand), and a situation that is difficult to get out of. The title of the infidelity-themed episode "The Cleveland–Loretta Quagmire" plays on the second meaning. MacFarlane came up with Quagmire's voice after listening to fast-talking radio jockeys from the 1950s era, describing the character as a "50s radio guy on coke." The "giggity" phrase was inspired by Steve Marmel's Jerry Lewis impression. Quagmire's home follows the same retro theme, decked out in a style reminiscent of the swinging party set of the 1950s and '60s; nearly every part of the house has a discreetly hidden bed. 
In a DVD bonus feature, MacFarlane singled out a line in "Love Thy Trophy", in which Quagmire answers a one-night stand's question about his job with the words "I have a question for you, too. Why are you still here?" as the moment where the character's over-sexed personality was crystallized.
In "The Cleveland–Loretta Quagmire", Quagmire has sex with Cleveland Brown's wife, Loretta, which ends their marriage. 
In "Jerome Is the New Black" and "Tiegs for Two", it is revealed that Quagmire's sex addiction is rooted in the pain and loneliness he has felt ever since breaking up with model Cheryl Tiegs in the 1980s.
Sexual appetites.
Quagmire is characterized as indulging in numerous sexual fetishes, from frotteurism, BDSM, biastophilia, and erotic asphyxiation to voyeurism, somnophilia, toucherism, zoophilia, and necrophilia. He is also a rapist; several episodes feature gags in which he has sex with women who are unconscious. His sexual exploits are a running gag throughout the show. He typically shouts variations of his catchphrase "giggity" when in sexual situations.

Biography.
Early years.
Steve was born in San Jose, and has been in California most of his life. He lived in Germany for a couple years where his little brother was born. By age 5, his family had settled in Saratoga, California. Steve and his two brothers and one sister all studied music growing up. His older sister studied piano and his older brother, the baritone horn. Steve took piano lessons off and on from age 5 and up. He also joined the school string orchestra in 5th grade playing violin, and played alto saxophone in the school concert band in 6th and 7th grades.
By the end of 7th grade, Steve had met up with future ALO bandmates Zach Gill and Dan Lebowitz to form their first rock band, One Percent Away. Steve bought a short-scale electric bass guitar and started lessons at the local guitar store, Torres Guitars, as well as taking notes from Gill's dad. The band changed their name to Django in high school and recorded their first album during their senior year, entitled "Contact".
College years.
Steve and his bandmates left for Santa Barbara, California after graduating high school to pursue degrees in music. After waivering between different studies within the UCSB Music Department, Steve took his last couple years of college to focus on a degree in ethnomusicology, writing his final thesis on the origin and evolution of Mariachi music from Mexico. Steve was also very active in the Jazz and Middle Eastern Music Ensembles. In the middle of college, Django picked up drummer Dave Brogan during the Summer of 1996, just before folding the project all together. Following Django, Steve and bandmates Gill and Lebowitz continued creating new bands, including Magnum Family, I.V. Dogs, The LAG Acoustic Buffet and eventually, in their last year at UCSB, The Animal Liberation Orchestra & The Free Range Horns.
After graduating from UCSB, Steve went on tour with Gill, Lebowitz and high school friend Rob Binkley, driving around the U.S. playing coffee shops, bars, small clubs and street corners, under the name The BLAG Buffet. On this trip, Steve was gifted his grandfather's Vega Artist banjo upon a pitstop/visit in Billings, MT. Upon his return to CA, Steve resettled back in his hometown of Saratoga for a few months, just before moving to San Francisco, California, which would be his home for the next 6 years.
San Francisco years.
In San Francisco, Steve worked restaurant jobs and eventually picked up a full-time job at a design firm where he learned print and web design skills that would later apply to a number of years as a freelance designer. Steve continued playing with ALO while in SF, with the addition of Shree Shyam Das on drums, who became a close friend and musical collaborator. Steve also picked up many gigs within the local scene, playing local clubs as well as private events for the booming dot-com businesses in the Bay Area. Through an outreach from Gill's keyboard repair technician, Steve ended up joining a bluegrass outfit called Philboyd Studge, playing string bass and singing occasional lead vocals. He also filled in occasionally with college friends who had also relocated to SF, The Court & Spark, as well as lending string bass to several of their studio recordings. During a break with ALO, Steve and Lebowitz did some Winter touring with the group Global Funk Council, a spin-off of Karl Denson's Tiny Universe.
ALO reunited in the Spring of 2002 with college bandmate Dave Brogan on drums, and has been touring the globe and recording steadily ever since. Through their college friendship with surfer/singer/songwriter Jack Johnson, Steve has also became part of the Brushfire Records family with ALO signing a record contract with the label in 2005. Steve has not only recorded two full-length records with ALO for Brushfire, but also appeared on several label compilations such as "A Brokedown Melody" and "Thank You... Goodnight". With occasional breaks and the on-going interest to promote side-projects from within the band, Steve has additionally toured with Brett Dennen, whom he met at the High Sierra Music Festival one Summer. And while on tour with Dennen, met support act Sara Bareilles which later resulted in touring with Sara and her band as well. Through the Bay Area jamband scene connection and from a long-time friendship with keyboardist Trevor Garrod who also graduated from Saratoga High, Steve has also done substantial touring with San Francisco rockers, Tea Leaf Green, filling in for their permanent bassist, Reed Mathis.
Steve joined San Francisco country/soul/rock band Nicki Bluhm & The Gramblers in 2009. 
Present.

Ancient Olympic Games

The Olympic Games () were a series of athletic competitions among representatives of city-states of Ancient Greece. They were held in honor of Zeus, and the Greeks gave them a mythological origin. Historical records indicate that they began in 776 BC in Olympia. They continued to be celebrated when Greece came under Roman rule, until the emperor Theodosius I suppressed them in 394 AD as part of the campaign to impose Christianity as the state religion of Rome. The games were held every four years, or "olympiad", which became a unit of time in historical chronologies.
During the celebration of the games, an Olympic Truce was enacted so that athletes could travel from their countries to the games in safety. The prizes for the victors were olive leaf wreaths or crowns. The games became a political tool used by city-states to assert dominance over their rivals. Politicians would announce political alliances at the games, and in times of war, priests would offer sacrifices to the gods for victory. The games were also used to help spread Hellenistic culture throughout the Mediterranean. The Olympics also featured religious celebrations and artistic competitions. The statue of Zeus at Olympia was counted as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Sculptors and poets would congregate each olympiad to display their works of art to would-be patrons.
The ancient Olympics had fewer events than the modern games, and only freeborn Greek men were allowed to participate, although a woman Bilistiche is also mentioned as a winning chariot owner. As long as they met the entrance criteria, athletes from any city-state and Macedon were allowed to participate, although the Hellanodikai, the officials in charge, allowed king Alexander I to participate in the games only after he had proven his Greek ancestry. The games were always held at Olympia rather than alternating to different locations as is the tradition with the modern Olympic Games. Victors at the Olympics were honored, and their feats chronicled for future generations.
Origins.
To the Greeks, it was important to root the Olympic Games in mythology. During the time of the ancient games their origins were attributed to the gods, and competing legends persisted as to who actually was responsible for the genesis of the games. These origin of traditions have become nearly impossible to untangle, yet a chronology and patterns have arisen that help people understand the story behind the games.
The earliest myths regarding the origin of the games are recounted by the Greek historian, Pausanias. According to the story, the dactyl Herakles (not to be confused with the son of Zeus) and four of his brothers, Paeonaeus, Epimedes, Iasius and Idas, raced at Olympia to entertain the newborn Zeus. He crowned the victor with an olive tree wreath, (which thus became a peace symbol) which also explains the four year interval, bringing the games around every fifth year (counting inclusively). The other Olympian gods (so named because they lived permanently on Mount Olympus), would also engage in wrestling, jumping and running contests.
Another myth, this one occurring after the aforementioned myth, is attributed to Pindar. He claims the festival at Olympia involved Pelops, king of Olympia and eponymous hero of the Peloponnesus, and Herakles, the son of Zeus. The story goes that after completing his labors, Herakles established an athletic festival to honor his father. Pelops, using trickery, and the help of Poseidon, won a chariot race against a local king and claimed the king's daughter. This is also attributed to Pausanias and is dated by the historian at 776 BC.
The games of previous millennia were discontinued and then revived by Lycurgus of Sparta, Iphitos of Elis, and Cleoisthenes of Pisa at the behest of the Oracle of Delphi who claimed that the people had strayed from the gods, which had caused a plague and constant war. Restoration of the games would end the plague, usher in a time of peace, and signal a return to a more traditional lifestyle. The patterns that emerge from these myths are that the Greeks believed the games had their roots in religion, that athletic competition was tied to worship of the gods, and the revival of the ancient games was intended to bring peace, harmony and a return to the origins of Greek life. Since these myths were documented by historians like Pausanias, who lived during the reign of Marcus Aurelius in the 160s AD, it is likely that these stories are more fable than fact. The games were abolished in 393 CE by Emperor Theodosius.
The origins of many aspects of the Olympics date to funeral games of the Mycenean period and later. Early examples are known such as those held for Patroclus by Achilles, described by Homer and in Book 5 of Virgil's "Aeneid", in which Aeneas organizes athletic contests on the anniversary of his father's death.
History.
The games were held to be one of the two central rituals in Ancient Greece, the other being the much older religious festival, the Eleusinian Mysteries.
The games started in Olympia, Greece, in a sanctuary site for the Greek deities near the towns of Elis and Pisa (both in Elis on the peninsula of Peloponnesos). The first games began as an annual foot race of young women in competition for the position of the priestess for the goddess, Hera and a second race was instituted for a consort for the priestess who would participate in the religious traditions at the temple.
The Heraea Games, the first recorded competition for women in the Olympic Stadium, were held as early as the sixth century BC. It originally consisted of foot races only, as did the competition for males. Some texts, including Pausanias's "Description of Greece", c. AD 175, state that Hippodameia gathered a group known as the "Sixteen Women" and made them administrators of the Heraea Games, out of gratitude for her marriage to Pelops. Other texts related to the Elis and Pisa conflict indicate that the "Sixteen Women" were peacemakers from Pisa and Elis and, because of their political competence, became administrators of the Heraea. Being the consort of Hera in Classical Greek mythology, Zeus was the father of the deities in the pantheon of that era. The Sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia housed a statue in ivory and gold of Zeus that had been sculpted by Phidias circa 445 BC. This statue was one of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World. By the time of the Classical Greek culture, in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, the games were restricted to male participants. 
The historian Ephorus, who lived in the fourth century BC, is one potential candidate for establishing the use of Olympiads to count years, although credit for codifying this particular epoch usually falls to Hippias of Elis, to Eratosthenes, or even to Timaeus, whom Eratosthenes may have imitated. The Olympic Games were held at four-year intervals, and later, the ancient historians' method of counting the years even referred to these games, using the term "Olympiad" for the period between two games. Previously, the local dating systems of the Greek states were used (they continued to be used by everyone except the historians), which led to confusion when trying to determine dates. For example, Diodorus states that there was a solar eclipse in the third year of the 113th Olympiad, which must be the eclipse of 316 BC. This gives a date of (mid-summer) 765 BC for the first year of the first Olympiad. Nevertheless, there is disagreement among scholars as to when the games began.
The only competition held then was, according to the later Greek traveller Pausanias who wrote in 175 AD., the "stadion" race, a race over about , measured after the feet of Hercules. The word "stadium" is derived from this foot race. 
The Greek tradition of athletic nudity (gymnos) was introduced in 720 BC, either by the Spartans or by the Megarian Orsippus, and this was adopted early in the Olympics as well.
Several groups fought over control of the sanctuary at Olympia, and hence the games, for prestige and political advantage. Pausanias later writes that in 668 BC, Pheidon of Argos was commissioned by the town of Pisa to capture the sanctuary from the town of Elis, which he did and then personally controlled the games for that year. The next year, Elis regained control.
The Olympic Games were part of the Panhellenic Games, four separate games held at two- or four-year intervals, but arranged so that there was at least one set of games every year. The Olympic Games were more important and more prestigious than the Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian Games.
The games were in decline for many years but continued past 385 AD, by which time flooding and earth quakes had damaged the buildings and invasions by barbarians had reached Olympia. In 394 Theodosius I banned all pagan festivals, but archeological evidence indicates that some games were still held.
Culture.
The ancient Olympics were as much a religious festival as an athletic event. The games were held in honor of the Greek god Zeus, and on the middle day of the games, 100 oxen would be sacrificed to him. Over time Olympia, site of the games, became a central spot for the worship of the head of the Greek pantheon and a temple, built by the Greek architect Libon was erected on the mountaintop. The temple was one of the largest Doric temples in Greece. The sculptor Pheidias created a statue of the god made of gold and ivory. It stood tall. It was placed on a throne in the temple. The statue became one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. As the historian Strabo put it, "... the glory of the temple persisted ... on account both of the festal assembly and of the Olympian Games, in which the prize was a crown and which were regarded as sacred, the greatest games in the world. The temple was adorned by its numerous offerings, which were dedicated there from all parts of Greece."
Artistic expression was a major part of the games. Sculptors, poets and other artisans would come to the games to display their works in what became an artistic competition. Sculptors created works like Myron's "Diskobolos" or "Discus Thrower". Their aim was to highlight natural human movement and the shape of muscles and the body. Poets would be commissioned to write prose in honor of the Olympic victors. These poems, known as "Epinicians", were passed on from generation to generation and many of them have lasted far longer than any other honor made for the same purpose. Baron Pierre de Coubertin, one of the founders of the modern Olympic Games, wanted to fully imitate the ancient Olympics in every way. Included in his vision was to feature an artistic competition modeled on the ancient Olympics and held every four years, during the celebration of the Olympic Games. His desire came to fruition at the Olympics held in Athens in 1896.
Politics.
Power in ancient Greece became centered around the city-state in the 8th century BC. The city-state was a population center organized into a self-contained political entity. These city-states often lived in close proximity to each other, which created competition for limited resources. Though conflict between the city-states was ubiquitous, it was also in their self-interest to engage in trade, military alliances and cultural interaction. The city-states had a dichotomous relationship with each other: On one hand, they relied on their neighbors for political and military alliances, while on the other they competed fiercely with those same neighbors for vital resources. The Olympic Games were established in this political context and served as a venue for representatives of the city-states to peacefully compete against each other.
In the first 200 years of the games' existence, they only had regional religious importance. Only Greeks in proximity to the mountain competed in these early games. This is evidenced by the dominance of Peloponnesian athletes in the victors' rolls. The spread of Greek colonies in the 5th and 6th centuries BC is repeatedly linked to successful Olympic athletes. For example, Pausanias recounts that Cyrene was founded c. 630 BC by settlers from Thera with Spartan support. The support Sparta gave was primarily the loan of three-time Olympic champion Chionis. The appeal of settling with an Olympic champion helped to populate the colonies and maintain cultural and political ties with the city-states near Olympia. Thus, Hellenistic culture and the games spread while the primacy of Olympia persisted. 
The games faced a serious challenge during the Peloponnesian War, which primarily pitted Athens against Sparta, but, in reality, touched nearly every Hellenistic city-state. The Olympics were used during this time to announce alliances and offer sacrifices to the gods for victory.
During the Olympic Games, a truce, or "ekecheiria" was observed. Three runners, known as "spondophoroi" were sent from Elis to the participant cities at each set of games to announce the beginning of the truce. During this period, armies were forbidden from entering Olympia, wars were suspended, and legal disputes and the use of the death penalty were forbidden. The truce was primarily designed to allow athletes and visitors to travel safely to the games and was, for the most part, observed. Thucydides wrote of a situation when the Spartans were forbidden from attending the games, and the violators of the truce were fined 2,000 minae for assaulting the city of Lepreum during the period of the "ekecheiria". The Spartans disputed the fine and claimed that the truce had not yet taken hold.
While a martial truce was observed by all participating city-states, no such reprieve from conflict existed in the political arena. The Olympic Games evolved the most influential athletic and cultural stage in ancient Greece, and arguably in the ancient world. As such the games became a vehicle for city-states to promote themselves. The result was political intrigue and controversy. For example, Pausanias, a Greek historian, explains the situation of the athlete Sotades, "Sotades at the ninety-ninth Festival was victorious in the long race and proclaimed a Cretan, as in fact he was. But at the next Festival he made himself an Ephesian, being bribed to do so by the Ephesian people. For this act he was banished by the Cretans."
Events.
Only free men who spoke Greek were allowed to participate in the Ancient Games of classical times. They were to some extent "international", in the sense that they included athletes from the various Greek city-states. Additionally, participants eventually came from Greek colonies as well, extending the range of the games to far shores of the Mediterranean and of the Black Sea.
To be in the games, the athletes had to qualify and have their names written in the lists. It seems that only young people were allowed to participate, as the Greek writer Plutarch relates that one young man was rejected for seeming overmature, and only after his lover, who presumably vouched for his youth, interceded with the King of Sparta, was he permitted to participate. Before being able to participate, every participant had to take an oath in front of the statue of Zeus, saying that he had been in training for ten months.
At first, the Olympic Games lasted only one day, but eventually grew to five days. The Olympic Games originally contained one event: the "stadion" (or "stade") race, a short sprint measuring between , or the length of the stadium. The length of the race is uncertain, since tracks found at archeological sites, as well as literary evidence, provide conflicting measurements. Runners had to pass five stakes that divided the lanes: one stake at the start, another at the finish, and three stakes in between. 
The "diaulos", or two-stade race, was introduced in 724 BC, during the 14th Olympic games. The race was a single lap of the stadium, approximately , and scholars debate whether or not the runners had individual "turning" posts for the return leg of the race, or whether all the runners approached a common post, turned, and then raced back to the starting line. 
A third foot race, the "dolichos", was introduced in 720 BC. Accounts of the race present conflicting evidence as to the length of the "dolichos"; however, the length of the race was 18–24 laps, or about three miles (5 km). The runners would begin and end their event in the stadium proper, but the race course would wind its way through the Olympic grounds. The course often would flank important shrines and statues in the sanctuary, passing by the Nike statue by the temple of Zeus before returning to the stadium. 
The last running event added to the Olympic program was the "hoplitodromos", or "Hoplite race", introduced in 520 BC and traditionally run as the last race of the Olympic Games. The runners would run either a single or double "diaulos" (approximately 400 or 800 yards) in full or partial armour, carrying a shield and additionally equipped either with greaves or a helmet. As the armour weighed between 50 and , the "hoplitodromos" emulated the speed and stamina needed for warfare. Due to the weight of the armour, it was easy for runners to drop their shields or trip over fallen competitors. In a vase painting depicting the event, some runners are shown leaping over fallen shields. The course they used for these runs were made out of clay, with sand over the clay.
Over the years, more events were added: boxing ("pygme"/"pygmachia"), wrestling ("pale") in 708 BC, and pankration, a fighting competition combining both elements. Wrestling was also the final decisive event in the ancient pentathlon. Boxing became increasingly brutal over the centuries. Initially, soft leather covered their fingers, but eventually, hard leather with metal sometimes was used. The fights had no rest periods and no rules against hitting a man while he was down. Bouts continued until one man either surrendered or died- however, killing an opponent wasn't a good thing, as the dead boxer was automatically declared the winner.
Other events include chariot racing, as well as a pentathlon, consisting of wrestling, "stadion", long jump, javelin throw, and discus throw (the latter three were not separate events). In the chariot racing event, it was not the rider, but the owner of the chariot and team who was considered to be the competitor, so one owner could win more than one of the top spots. 
The addition of events meant the festival grew from one day to five days, three of which were used for competition. The other two days were dedicated to religious rituals. On the final day, there was a banquet for all the participants, consisting of 100 oxen that had been sacrificed to Zeus on the first day.
The winner of an Olympic event was awarded an olive branch and often was received with much honour throughout Greece, especially in his home town, where he was often granted large sums of money (in Athens, 500 drachma, a small fortune) and prizes including vats of olive oil. (See Milo of Croton.) Sculptors would create statues of Olympic victors, and poets would sing odes in their praise for money.
Participation in most events was limited to male athletes except for women who were allowed to take part by entering horses in the equestrian events. In 396 BC, and again in 392 BC, the horses of a Spartan princess named Cynisca won the four-horse race.
The athletes usually competed nude, not only as the weather was appropriate, but also as the festival was meant to celebrate, in part, the achievements of the human body. Olive oil was used by the competitors, not only as a substitute for soap for washing, bathing, and cleaning, but also as a natural cosmetic, to keep skin smooth, and provide an appealing look for the participants. Because the men competed nude, married women were forbidden to watch the Olympics under penalty of death. Contrastingly, in Sparta—which, compared to Athens, was less restrictive to its female citizens in general—both men and women did exercise unclothed.
Olympic festivals in other places.
Athletic festivals under the name of "Olympic games", named in imitation of the original festival at Olympia, were established over time in various places all over the Greek world. Some of these are only known to us by inscriptions and coins; but others, as the Olympic festival at Antioch, obtained great celebrity. After these Olympic festivals had been established in several places, the great Olympic festival itself was sometimes designated in inscriptions by the addition of Pisa.

<doc id="19098447" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19098447" title="SARG04">
SARG04

SARG04 is a quantum cryptography protocol derived from the first protocol of that kind, BB84.
Origin.
Researchers built SARG04 when they noticed that by using the four states of BB84 with a different information encoding they could develop a new protocol which would be more robust when attenuated laser pulses are used instead of single-photon sources. SARG04 was defined by Scarani et al. in 2004 in Physical Review Letters as a prepare and measure version (in which it is equivalent to BB84 when viewed at the level of quantum processing).
An entanglement-based version has been defined as well.
Intended use.
The intended use of SARG04 is in situations where the information is originated by a Poissonian source producing weak pulses (this means: mean number of photons < 1) and received by an imperfect detector.
Modus operandi.
The modus operandi of SARG04 is based on the principle that the hardware must remain the same (as prior protocols) and the only change must be in the protocol itself.
In the original "prepare and measure" version, SARG04's two conjugated bases are chosen with equal probability.
Double clicks are important for comprehending SARG04: double clicks work differently in BB84 and SARG04.
Security.
Kiyoshi Tamaki and Hoi-Kwong Lo were successful in proving security for one and two-photon pulses using SARG04.
It has been confirmed that SARG04 is more robust than BB84 against incoherent PNS attacks.
Unfortunately an incoherent attack has been identified which performs better than a simple phase-covariant cloning machine, and SARG04 has been found to be particularly vulnerable in single-photon implementations when Q >= 14.9%.
Comparison with BB84.
In single-photon implementations, SARG04 was theorised to be equal with BB84, but experiments shown that it is inferior.

Androsace filiformis

Androsace filiformis is a species of flowering plant in the primrose family known by the common names filiform rockjasmine and slender-stemmed androsace. It is an uncommon plant native to the western United States, where it grows in mountain meadows. It is also known from Eurasia. This is a small annual herb forming hairy to hairless patches up to 12 centimeters tall. The basal rosette contains finely toothed leaves up to 2 centimeters long, often much smaller, and oval to nearly triangular in shape. There are generally several open umbels of tiny five-lobed white flowers on long pedicels.

CSS Alabama's South Atlantic Expeditionary Raid

The CSS "Alabama's" South Atlantic Expeditionary Raid commenced shortly after the CSS Alabama left Haiti and the Caribbean Sea and cruised south toward Brazil in the south Atlantic Ocean. The raid lasted from about the beginning of February, 1863 to the end of July, 1863.
The primary area of operation during this expeditionary raid, was the Atlantic seaboard of South America starting from the northern end of Brazil then ranging up down along the Brazilian coast before finally heading east toward southernAfrica.
Raid overview.
The CSS "Alabama" worked its way slowly down the east coast of Brazil in the most devastating of its seven raids, capturing or burning dozens of enemy Yankee vessels.
From this raiding area off the coast of Brazil, the CSS "Alabama" made her way into the Indian Ocean by way of the Cape of Good Hope to continue her unhindered wrecking of enemy commerce in the Indian Ocean as far as Indonesia.

Animalize Tour

The Animalize Tour was a concert tour by American band Kiss in support of their "Animalize" album. 
It was divided into two halves: the European leg and the U.S. leg, with two very different shows and stage sets. The European staging was essentially the Unmasked Tour stage, decorated to resemble the "Animalize" album cover (amps painted with leopard spots and tiger stripes). One short-lived prop saw two growling panthers covering Eric Carr's bass drums. 
When "Animalize" became a surprise hit in America, a much larger stage set was designed for the American leg of the tour by Tait Towers.
The shows would start much in the same manner as the Dynasty show, with the band being lifted onto the stage by a lift behind the drum riser. Sound effects of a large airplane landing would be played over the speakers while the band was coming up, and after the famous "You Wanted The Best" intro the band would launch into "Detroit Rock City". This was the first tour with Bruce Kulick on lead guitar, replacing Mark St. John who couldn't play due to his arthritic condition. Originally Kulick was a temporary replacement, but St. John's condition did not improve, and Kulick was named an official member on December 8, 1984. Bon Jovi was the opening act on the European leg, with Queensrÿche, WASP and Krokus opening shows in North America.
The "Animalize" period was the band's most successful of the decade with the crossover success of "Heaven's on Fire" onto CHR/Top 40 radio, a very well-attended concert trek, and with "Animalize" selling nearly 2 million copies by the end of the tour.

<doc id="19098522" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19098522" title="The Fifth Corner">
The Fifth Corner

The Fifth Corner is a very short-lived American television series which aired on NBC and produced by TriStar Television in 1992. The two-hour pilot aired on April 17, 1992, and one final episode aired the week after.
Series overview.
Richard Braun (McArthur) is a man who wakes up one day with absolutely no recollection of who he is. It's a bad time for him to suffer from amnesia, as he also discovers to his horror he wakes up next to a dead woman in bed. The questions begin. Who is he? What is his profession? Is Richard Braun even his real name? Did he kill the woman?
Aided by his sidekick/driver Boone (Freeman), Braun sets out to try to discover his real identity. He returns home to find items such as designer clothes, weapons, fake IDs and passports, which leads him to believe that he is a deep-undercover spy. He also learns a little bit about his likes and dislikes. There are also some bad guys led by Dr. Grandwell (Coburn) who would like to know about his past and real identity. During this process, a reporter named Erica Fontaine (Delaney) also sets out to find out more about who Braun is.
Episodes.
"Trio" (April 17, 1992) Friday, 9pm-11pm. Written and directed by John Herzfeld. Guest Cast: Sergio Calderon; A man who lost his memory finds himself tied to the murder of a woman and a larger conspiracy. He discovers he has many names, one of which is the nickname Fifth Corner. A beautiful redhead named Erica is on his trail. Everyone wants his mysterious diary (a laptop with details of all his assignments). His evil boss Grandwell wants him back working for The Corporation, which disappoints Fifth Corner's rival The Hat who wants him dead.
Each episode featured a self-contained mystery involving another persona of Fifth Corner. We began with the name Richard Braun, but then switched to George Thompson. The mystery was who killed the woman "Richard" woke up with in bed, and why she was killed. "George" switched our attention to Grandwell and the mystery of who the Fifth Corner was.
"Eva" (April 24, 1992) Friday, 10-11pm Written by John Herzfeld. Directed by Albert Pyun. Guest Cast: Peter Kwong and Tim Thomerson. Fifth Corner (aka “George”) search for his wife Eva is interrupted when he is arrested as Jack Previn for the murder of a Japanese electronic genius. He is about to be extradited to Japan when the blonde who works for The Hat arrives and post bail. The new name is Jack Previn and the mystery is the death of a Japanese inventor and his missing amazing electronic gadget. The arc story of Fifth Corner's search for his identity and Erica's obsession about bringing down Grandwell continue as the series primary focus.
"Home" (never aired). Written by John Herzfeld and Bryce Zabel. Directed by Sam Pillsbury. Guest Cast: Barbara Barrie and Chris Allport. While Fifth Corner continues to search for his identity Grandwell has erased all evidence of Erica's existence. Fifth Corner may have found his family and his name, John Avlean. The mob is moving in on John's big brother's restaurant. When the Fifth Corner and Boone take on the mob, things go wrong. This week's name is John Avlean and the mystery deals with the mob's attempt to take over John's big brother's restaurant.
“Woman at Her Toilette.” (unaired). Written by Leslie Bohem and John Herzfeld. Directed by Gabrielle Beaumont. Guest Cast: Marina Sirtis, and Frank Stallone. Grandwell wants the painting he had Anthony Parachini (Fifth Corner) steal for him. Fifth Corner can’t remember where the painting is, but finds yet another identity, Jean Michel, that leads him to it. To complicate things, a hit squad arrives to kill Grandwell, and Anthony and get the painting. To save Erica and get her life back, Fifth Corner makes a deal with Grandwell. Two new names are featured, Anthony who worked for Grandwell and Jean who lead a secret life from Grandwell. The mystery is where is the painting.
“Sword of Damocles.” (never aired). Written and directed by John Herzfeld. Guest Cast: Paul Cain and Tianna Thorpe. Fifth Corner had agreed never see Erica again if Grandwell restores her identity. When Erica learns of the deal, she rejects it, even if it means she will be killed. Grandwell remains in his forgiving mood in regard to Fifth Corner, but The Hat finally convinces Grandwell to let him kill Fifth Corner. Grandwell expects and hopes The Hat will fail. The last episode spares us a new name or mystery as we rush towards the resolution of Grandwell and Fifth Corner arc story. The final gunfight is the perfect example of where this series went wrong, as everyone was busy self-analyzing each other that the actual shooting was almost an afterthought. The series ends with many of the questions unanswered including the real name of Fifth Corner.

<doc id="19098525" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19098525" title="William A. Eddy">
William A. Eddy

William Alfred "Bill" Eddy, Ph.D., Col., USMC (March 9, 1896–May 3, 1962) was a U.S. minister to Saudi Arabia (1944–1946), university professor and college president (1936–42), and United States Marine Corps officer—serving in World War I and World War II, and U.S. intelligence officer.
After serving in World War I, Eddy had an academic career as a literary scholar and professor of English, at Dartmouth College and the American University in Cairo. He was later president of both Hobart College and William Smith College (1936–42). Dr. Eddy returned to military service just before the start of World War II, serving as an intelligence officer. From 1943 to 1945, he was the U.S. Minister to Saudi Arabia, a consultant for the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco) and an instrumental figure in the development of the United States' relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries. He was a key figure in the formation of the CIA.
In 2008 "Arabian Knight: Colonel Bill Eddy USMC and the Rise of American Power in the Middle East", the first biography on Bill Eddy, was published by Selwa Press. It is written by the Middle East specialist, author and "Washington Post" journalist Thomas Lippman.
Early life.
William Alfred Eddy was born in 1896 in the city of Sidon, at the time a part of Syria, now in Lebanon. His parents, William King Eddy and Elizabeth Mills (Nelson) Eddy, were Presbyterian missionaries from the United States. Eddy grew up speaking both English at home and in school and Arabic on the streets with his friends. He stayed in the Middle East until high school and then went to the College of Wooster for his college preparatory education. His overseas upbringing and firsthand knowledge of Arabic and Arab culture would play a pivotal role in his life and in American–Saudi relations.
World War I.
Following his graduation from Princeton University in 1917 and marriage to Mary Garvin, Eddy was accepted into the United States Marine Corps on June 6, 1917 as a "temporary second lieutenant" and was a part of the first American Marines fighting in Europe in World War I, serving as an intelligence officer with the 6th Marine Regiment.
During the war he fought alongside other U.S. Marines in the German Offensive of 1918 and in the Battle of Belleau Wood against German Empire troops that same year. The battle is seen as an important success for allied forces against the Germans. Eddy was seriously injured at Belleau Wood, losing one leg because of his wounds, and was sent back to the U.S. to recuperate.
For his actions as a combat Marine in World War I, he received the Navy Cross, the Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, and two Purple Hearts.
Teaching and academic years.
After his military service, Eddy taught at Peekskill Military Academy in New York. In 1922, he received his doctorate from Princeton University. His dissertation was on "Gulliver's Travels".
In 1923, he was appointed as the chair of the English Department at the American University in Cairo in Egypt. His wife and children found life in Egypt difficult, however, and Eddy returned to the U.S. in 1928 to accept a teaching position at Dartmouth College.
In 1936, he became president of Hobart College in upstate New York.
World War II.
With the threat of another World War looming, Eddy returned to active duty in the United States Marine Corps at the rank of lieutenant colonel and in 1941 became the Naval Attaché and Naval Attaché for Air in Cairo. He would work with both Naval intelligence and the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) for the duration of the war.
Early in the war, Eddy suggested that the United States try to become closer to Saudi Arabia because of its strategic importance and because of the country's relative independence and internal stability.
In December 1941, Eddy was redeployed as Naval Attaché to Tangier, Morocco in order to try to help secure areas of North Africa under threat by the Germans. He was instrumental in obtaining intelligence there and set up an intelligence network which streamlined the process of conveying information from the field back to the US.
While in Tangier Eddy was also part of a group which helped organize subversive fighting elements in Spanish Morocco in case the Germans made it west.
His intelligence work on the ground was a key to the success of allied operations including the pivotal Patton-led Operation Torch, which began in 1942.
Saudi Arabia.
In 1943, the Navy and the OSS agreed to cooperate in sending Eddy to Saudi Arabia as a U.S. State Department employee. His official title was "Special Assistant to the American Minister" resident at the American Legation in the city of Jeddah. He was told to visit neighboring Gulf states as well in order to begin and build the U.S.–Middle East relationships that were already beginning to emerge.
At the time, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had already begun in earnest to begin a relationship with Saudi Arabia, and oil exploration and drilling was continuing and building up via the US company CASOC, Aramco's predecessor.
In 1944, he met King Abdul-Aziz Al Saud (Ibn Saud) for the first time, and they would maintain a close relationship until the king's death in 1953. On September 23, 1944, he became the "Envoy Extraordinary and Ministory Plenipotentiary" to Saudi Arabia, remaining in this post until May 28, 1946—the 2nd resident U.S. chief of mission to Saudi Arabia.
On February 14, 1945, King Abdul-Aziz had a historic meeting with President Roosevelt on board the U.S. Naval ship the on the Great Bitter Lake of the Suez Canal in Egypt. Colonel Eddy was asked by the King to be translator for both the King and for President Roosevelt for their conversation. It was the first time the King had left Saudi Arabia. Much of the men's conversation was recorded by Eddy in a later work titled "FDR Meets Ibn Saud".
During his brief stay in the kingdom, Eddy was instrumental in cementing the U.S.-Saudi relationship and in bringing in U.S. business to the kingdom and in keeping out other foreign, mainly British at the time, business interests.
Eddy left in 1946 and then spent some time in Yemen further developing U.S. relations with the Middle East.
CIA.
On August 1, 1946, Eddy was appointed the post of Special Assistant to the Secretary of State for Research and Intelligence. He was an instrumental figure in the passing of the National Security Act of 1947 which in essence allowed for the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency. Eddy and his family moved to Washington, D.C. where he worked on creating and developing the CIA and also on continuing the development of U.S.–Middle Eastern relations.
American support of the partition of Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state met with some skepticism throughout the Middle East. Despite the U.S. support of the Zionist cause, however, many Arab states like Saudi Arabia continued to build their relationship with the U.S. because of their strong ties with people like Colonel Eddy.
Writing from his new home base of Beirut in the late 1940s, Eddy included in his CIA assessment of the region a warning about religious fundamentalism that could grow with the continued US support of the partition idea.
Aramco.
During the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s, Eddy worked as a consultant for the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco). He was an instrumental figure in keeping Aramco–Saudi relations as peaceful as could be. Given King Abdul-Aziz's relationship with Eddy and other Americans like Thomas Barger, the Saudis resisted completely nationalizing the company and instead brokered several key deals that would maintain American involvement and training while at the same time expanding benefits brought by the oil revenue to more Saudis.
Final days.
His final days were spent in Beirut. Dr. William Eddy died of a stroke on May 3, 1962 at age 66 in the hospital of the American University of Beirut, which his father and family friends had helped to found.
He was buried in the city of his birth, Sidon, in an Arab Christian graveyard. His grave is inscribed: "William Alfred Eddy. Colonel, U.S.M.C. Born Sidon, March 9, 1896. Died Beirut, May 3, 1962."

<doc id="19098526" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19098526" title="Water supply and sanitation in the Republic of Ireland">
Water supply and sanitation in the Republic of Ireland

"This article was written in 2008 with some updating, including in 2013. Please feel free to further update it, if need be."
Water supply and sanitation services in Ireland, in contrast to most countries in the world, are provided free of charge to domestic users, and have been since 1997. Only non-domestic users are billed for these services. The bulk of the costs of service provision is met from tax revenues transferred by the national government to local authorities, which are responsible for service provision. Ireland is the only OECD country without domestic water charges.
Some 1.6 billion litres of water are treated each day nationally by local authorities; 540 million litres of this is for the wider Dublin area. The low density and spatial distribution of population has resulted in an extensive network of water distribution compared to many other countries – with over 25,000 km of pipes in total.
The quality of water from the public mains is usually quite high. Amongst public water supplies, 98.7% of supplies were from free from E. coli, representing an 86% reduction in the number of contaminated supplies since 2005. High levels of leakage in the public water network, averaging 41% across the country, remain a concern.
In December 2010, as part of a bailout programme agreed with the EU-ECB-IMF, the government agreed to consider transferring responsibility for water services provision from local authorities to a new water utility and to introduce of domestic water charges in 2012/2013. 
In January 2012, the Minister of Environment, Phil Hogan, announced a six-week consultation on a planned fundamental reform of the water sector. In addition to the introduction of metered domestic water tariffs, a new utility, Irish Water, would be established and take over responsibility for water services from the local authorities. Independent economic regulation of water services will be introduced through the Commission for Energy Regulation. Reforms will come into effect in January 2014.
Water resources and use.
Water resources are abundant in Ireland, with 82% of drinking water supplies in Ireland sourced from surface water (i.e. rivers and lakes) and 18% coming from groundwater - 10.5% from groundwater and 7.6% from springs. This high dependence on surface water is above the EU average. Only about 2% of Ireland's abundant water resources are abstracted for human use. Unaccounted for water constitutes 41% of total water supply, followed by supply for domestic demand (39%), and non-domestic demand (20%).
[[File:Cork river lee.jpg|thumb|200x200px|
The River Lee is a source of water supply for the city of Cork
80% of the Irish population is served by 939 public water supplies. The remaining 20% is served by 643 public group water schemes(serving 2.3% of the population), 486 private group water schemes (serving 4.7%), 1,429 small private supplies (serving 0.7%) and private wells that are exempt from the regulations (serving 12.3%).
In the absence of domestic tariffs and meters, domestic water use is higher than in other European countries, with daily domestic consumption of water by customer at approximately 160 litres in Ireland. This compares to 150 litres in the UK (where approximately 40% of households are metered), 121 litres in Germany and 114 litres in Denmark (all users are metered in both countries). At 141m³ per inhabitant, Ireland has the third highest freshwater abstraction rate per inhabitant of 26 EU countries, ranked behind only Italy and Croatia.
Water shortages that are possibly related to increases in demand, high levels of leakage and changing precipitation patterns due to climate change have left some larger urban areas– particularly Dublin – struggling to meet demand during prolonged dry spells. With a surplus supply of 1% at any given time, the greater Dublin area faces water shortages in the coming 10 years. Furthermore, studies have shown that as the city's population grows close to 2 million there will be a demand for an extra 300 million litres of water per day, compared to 540 million litres per day today.
A 2006 feasibility study for the Greater Dublin water supply urges the immediate development of a new water source, pointing out that it will be needed no later than 2015-2016 to avert water rationing and the curtailment of economic growth. It also argues there is no time to waste because it will take at least a decade to build this proposed new source.
Dublin City Council has produced proposals for water to be abstracted from Lough Derg on the Shannon river to supply Dublin’s water needs, with raw water stored in the midlands as part of the process, but this project must be progressed through statutory planning processes. Also, regional variations in rainfall and population distribution give much less favourable conditions in the east of the country compared to other areas.
Service quality.
The quality of water from the public mains is usually quite high and compliant with EU drinking water standards. However, the poor microbiological quality of rural private group water schemes and groundwater continue to challenge authorities responsible for drinking water.
The quality of drinking water in Ireland was brought forcefully to the attention of the Irish public with the outbreak of waterborne cryptosporidiosis in Galway during 2007, which caused illness in over 240 people, and led to the imposition of a boil water notice in Galway for a period of 5 months during the peak tourist season. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), while "many have taken the quality of drinking water in Ireland for granted in the past, this can no longer be the case".
On 14 November 2002, Ireland was condemned by the European Court of Justice over the microbiological contamination of hundreds of public and private water supplies. The EU's Drinking Water Directive requires an absence of E. coli in drinking water supplies in order to protect human health. In 2007 EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas gave the Irish government a final warning before a fine would be issued: "I am concerned that, more than four years after a court ruling, and despite substantial Government investments, a significant number of local authority and private water supplies still show a presence of E. coli." 
The Environmental Protection Agency’s 2011 report on drinking water reported that drinking water quality in public water supplies was continuing to improve. Chemical standard compliance stands at 99.5%. 1.3% of supplies were found to have had E.coli, a reduction of 86% since 2005. 10.2% of private group supplies had E.coli, down from 11.6% in 2010. 7.7% of small private supplies were found to have E.coli exceedences, down from 7.4% in 2010.
In October and November, 2013, severe difficulties were encountered with the water supply to Dublin. The Ballymore Eustace water treatment works processes water from its main supply, the Poulaphouca reservoir. During October, the water characteristics changed, in a way that has yet to be described in detail. The effect was that particles in the water would not settle out satisfactorily, leaving tap water cloudy. As a result, the supply to the Dublin has been restricted, with supplies withdrawn from 8pm until 7am.
Wastewater treatment.
The proportion of waste water discharges where secondary treatment facilities have been provided has increased significantly from 26% between 1998-1999 to 93%. This is due predominantly to the new wastewater treatment plants at Ringsend (Dublin), Cork City, Limerick City, Galway City and Dundalk. The provision of secondary treatment facilities with nutrient reduction continues to increase.
According to a 2011 EPA report, 11 of 174 agglomerations covered by the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive did not have the required level of wastewater treatment, but are expected to have secondary treatment by 2015 at the latest. 70% of agglomerations (larger urban areas in Ireland) were compliant with the requirements of the Directive in 2011, an improvement on 63% compliance in 2010and 57% in 2009.
The report found that:
Septic tanks and other domestic wastewater treatment systems.
Whilst 66% of households are connected to public sewerage schemes, with the majority in urban areas, 27.5% of households used an individual septic tank, while 3% adopted other individual sewerage systems.
In October 2009, the European Court of Justice ruled against Ireland regarding septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems. It deemed Ireland non-compliant with Articles 4 and 8 of the Waste Directive in relation to domestic wastewaters disposed of in the countryside. Ireland was fined €2 million and the Court imposed daily fines of €12,000 for each day of delay in achieving compliance. Central to ending the case against Ireland was establishing a national inspection plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems. In 2012, the government passed the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012, which provided for a new inspection system and requires owners of septic tanks and other on-site treatment systems to register their systems with their local authority. A new registration and inspection regime was introduced in June 2012. System owners must register their system’s details and systems may be inspected. By July 2013, almost 90% of owners of premises connected with such systems had registered their systems. The government has announced details of a grant scheme for remedial work on a system.
Responsibility for water supply and sanitation.
The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is responsible for water and sanitation policy sector within the Irish government. Enforcement of drinking water quality regulations is the responsibility of the Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Regulation.
Drinking Water quality. Water services authorities – local authorities in the case of public supplies  – are responsible for the monitoring of drinking water. Local authorities are responsible for testing the quality of water, in conjunction with the Local Health Office (HSE). Under the 2007 Drinking Water Regulations, the EPA has supervisory powers for public water supplies. It can direct a water services authority to improve the management or quality of a public water supply. The EPA audits water services authorities in respect of their role in the production of drinking water. Where it finds any deficiencies, it makes recommendations as to what action the water services authority needs to take to remedy any deficiency. Likewise, water services authorities have a supervisory role in relation to group water schemes and private supplies, and must notify the EPA of drinking water non-compliances or risks to public health from a public water supply.
Economic regulation. Unlike the United Kingdom, there is currently no economic regulator for water supply and sanitation in Ireland. Under the 2013 Water Services Act, the Commission for Energy Regulation is assigned powers to advise the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on the development of a regulatory framework for water services. Economic regulation of water services is due to commence after enactment of the forthcoming Water Services (Amendment) No. 2 Bill 2013.
Service provision.
See also Local government in the Republic of Ireland, Dublin's Water History
Water services are the responsibility of local authorities, which receive a subsidy from central government. Local authorities, comprising 5 city councils and 29 county councils, are water services authorities.
Dublin Region Every day approximately 540 million litres of high quality drinking water is produced and supplied to over 1.44 million customers in the Dublin Region. This corresponds to a per capita water production of 378 litres per day before losses and including commercial uses.
Dublin City Council's Water Services Division is responsible for supplying 70% of this water and the balance is being provided by Fingal County Council. Water is collected from Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow for treatment at the City Council's three water treatment plants at Ballymore Eustace, Roundwood and Ballyboden and at the Fingal County Council plant at Leixlip. It is then distributed to customers in Dublin City and in the South Dublin, Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal, Kildare and Wicklow County Council areas through a network of service reservoirs and 8,000 km of pipes of which 2,700 km are the responsibility of Dublin City Council.
Group water schemes. Group water schemes are found in rural areas and are outside the scope of the urban public mains systems administered by local authorities. A group scheme is a scheme servicing water or wastewater services to two or more households not connected to the public water supply and/or wastewater collection systems. Group schemes are private or public, depending on whether their water is supplied from the public mains or a private source. All group schemes connected to public supplies are fitted with a water meter so the local authority can monitor the amount of water used by the group. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government provides funding, via local authorities, for establishing authorised group schemes as well as a range of capital and operational supports to group water schemes, subject to local authority approval and certain limits.The EPA 2011 report on drinking water quality in Ireland indicates that there are some 1,129 group water schemes, serving 7% of the public, covered by the Drinking Water Regulations because they serve more than 50 people or supply a commercial operation. 643 are public group schemes and 486 are private group water schemes.
The National Federation of Group Water Schemes was established to represent the interests of members of group water schemes. It provides advisory,training, developmental and other services to scheme members.
Financial aspects and efficiency.
Although there are no domestic water charges in Ireland, the country has undertaken significant investments in water and sanitation. In 2011, water services cost €1.2 billion (capital and operational spending), with 85% of the cost funded by the Exchequer. These investments were financed by the national government with support from the European Union. Despite these substantial investments, water leakage (41% of total water) remains much higher than in England and Wales (approximately 25%) or in most other EU countries.
In 2013, €326 million was allocated by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for infrastructural spending on water. An increase in infrastructural investment is needed, however, with a 2011 assessment by PwC on transferring responsibility for water services from a local authority to a national utility assuming in its analysis that €600 million of capital investment is needed annually (excluding the cost of the current metering programme and increased efficiencies in infrastructural spending).
Tariffs.
All water charges for domestic use in urban areas in Ireland were abolished on 1 January 1997. Domestic use is defined as drinking, washing, heating and sanitation. There are approximately 1.35 million domestic water connections served by public water supplies. Members of rural group water schemes usually pay for domestic water and wastewater services. As part of a Programme of Assistance agreed with the EC-ECB-IMF ‘troika’ in November 2010, the Fianna Fáil-Green Party government committed to re-introducing domestic water charges in 2012/2013. This followed a commitment made in the Renewed Programme for Government, published in October 2009, to introduce charges based on a system of a free allowance per household, with charges on usage above the allowance. A month before the government’s agreement with the troika,the administration’s ‘National Recovery Plan 2010-2014’ stated that metering would form part of charges and be introduced by 2014. Domestic water charges, a requirement under the EC-ECB-IMF’s Programme of Assistance, will be introduced in Quarter 4 2014, with households receiving their first bills in Quarter 1 2015. Bills will be issued for usage in arrears, similar to those for electricity or gas.
Households are expected to receive a free allowance, with charges based on metered usage above the free allowance. Environment Minister Phil Hogan has said households unmetered at the time of charges introduction will be charged on an assessed basis (e.g. dwelling type,number of people in a house etc.).
Non-domestic water charges - either flat rate or metered - are levied on businesses, schools, hospitals and other non-domestic users. There are about 150,000 non-domestic connections, which constitute approximately 20% of total public water supply.
Non-domestic customers pay a combined charge for water and wastewater. Local authorities set the rates. In 2013, the national average water rate stood at €1.13 per m³. The national average wastewater rate was €1.19 per m³. €2.37 per m³ is the average combined rate. Significant variation exists in the local authorities’ rates, however, with Kildare County Council having a combined rate of €1.59 per m³, in contrast with €3.04 per m³ charged by Wicklow County Council. The cost of water for industrial users has remained relatively static since 2007.
Under the Fine Gael-Labour government’s water sector reform programme, the introduction of economic regulation in January 2014 is expected to lead to a standardisation of non-domestic tariffs over time.
Investment.
Under the EU’s Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive 1991, local authorities are obliged to construct secondary and tertiary water treatment plants by 2008. New wastewater treatment plants were built in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway between 2000 and 2011, generating additional capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 3.96 million. Over the same period, drinking water treatment capacity has been increased by an amount sufficient to meet the needs of a population equivalent of 1.4 million people. The compliance level under the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive increased from 25% to 93%. Under the government’s ‘Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016’ blueprint, €1.58 billion in capital investment is to be allocated for water services between 2012-2016, with €326 million now earmarked for 2013. The majority of the funding will be channelled through the 2010-2013 Water Services Investment Programme, which is targeting reduction in leakage levels; improvements in drinking water standards; capacity and security of supply (including planning a new long-term source for the Greater Dublin Area) and wastewater discharges. Infrastructure under the Greater Dublin Strategic Drainage Strategy is also promised. 
Financing and Subsidies.
Funding for maintaining and improving the water supply and sanitation infrastructure comes from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. Indirectly, substantial funding historically came from the European Union through its European Regional Development Fund. In addition, local authorities levy planning contributions mainly for small capital improvements. Group scheme members are entitled to a subsidy from their local authority. After the abolition of domestic water charges in 1997, it was intended that this scheme would extend those benefits to households supplied by group water schemes. The amount of subsidy is 100% of the qualifying expenditure, meaning that all running costs of the scheme are covered by the subsidy as long as they do not exceed the subsidy limit. The amount is around €50 per house per year. Group water schemes are also entitled to technical and grant assistance for any upgrading works that may need to be carried out.
Efficiency and levels of water leakage.
Leakage levels in Ireland currently stand at 41%, with considerable variation between local authorities, in part explained by corrosion of antiquated pipes. As part of the National Water Study, conducted in 2000, a water audit was undertaken for 91 water schemes outside Dublin to establish levels of non-revenue water (NRW). The report noted that the poor quality of data and the low level of consumer metering limited the reliability of their figures. They found an average level of NRW of 47%, corresponding to 34 litres/connection/hour and 29 m3/km/day. This compares to only 10.1 m3/km/day in England, Scotland 21.3 m3/km/day, Netherlands 1.6 m3/km/day and Denmark 1.7 m3/km/day.
History since 1977.
The history of water supply in Ireland since the mid-1970s is dominated by controversies about whether there should be charges for domestic water supply. Domestic water charges were first abolished in 1977, only to be reintroduced by some local authorities following legislation in 1983 authorising them to do so.Domestic water charges were then prohibited by legislation in 1997 following an anti-water charges campaign in 1994-97. This resulted in a legal prohibition of domestic water charges at national level.

Economic history of the Republic of Ireland, Taxation in the Republic of Ireland
The first abolition of domestic water charges.
Domestic rates, which financed the cost of water services were abolished for the first time by a Fianna Fáil government, following the 1977 general election. In the same period, an increase took place in Income Tax and Value Added Tax. The revenue from these increases, and from borrowing which was very high during the late 1970s and early 1980s, was to be used to fund the local authorities, which had previously relied on domestic rates for their funding. From then on the central government paid a "rate support grant" to Local Authorities.
However, in 1983 the then Fine Gael-Labour government decided to cut this grant and passed legislation to allow councils to levy service charges. This was perceived by some as "double taxation", since the previously increased taxes remained at their high levels. Opponents also argued that rates were unrelated to consumption and that there were insufficient provisions to protect the poor.
The Dublin fight against water charges 1994-1997.
Many councils decided to introduce water charges, while others such as Dublin initially decided against introducing them. After water charges were introduced in Dublin in 1994, an anti-water charges campaign was initiated and included demonstrations and a boycott of the new charges. The city threatened to cut the water supply to those who did not pay. After lengthy court battles, some non-paying users were cut off, but the non-payment of water charges continued.
On 19 December 1996, on the eve of general elections, the Minister for the Environment Brendan Howlin from the Labour Party of the Rainbow Government of Fine Gael–Labour Party–Democratic Left announced that the water charge was going to be replaced by a new system in which motor tax collected in each area would be the source for local council funding.
The second abolition of domestic water charges.
Domestic water charges in Ireland were thus prohibited under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997, passed in May 1997 shortly before the June 1997 general elections in which Fine Gael lost to Fianna Fáil under Bertie Ahern. However, given popular discontent the new government chose not to pursue domestic water charges. Instead, it embarked on extensive consultations which resulted in the 1998 water services pricing policy. The policy banned cross-subsidy of domestic services from non-domestic charges. For non-domestic users, the policy required the recovery of average operational and marginal capital costs of water services from these users. It also foresaw the metering of all non-domestic users by 2006. Domestic operational costs were to be paid for through a local government fund, and capital costs were to be financed through the capital programme of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.
As a result, according to one critical observer, "a generation of people is growing up without realizing that water is expensive to deliver". According to a water industry source, Irish households use more water than UK metered equivalents. Investment costs are rising as water is accessed from further afield and from water bodies that are potentially sensitive fish habitats.
The Water Services Bill 2003.
The Water Services Bill 2003 was presented to the Oireachtas by then Environment Minister, Martin Cullen of Fianna Fáil. The bill was designed to consolidate Ireland's existing body of 15 different enactments into a single act, and to transpose EU water legislation. Cullen called it "the first root and branch consolidation and modernisation of water services law for more than 120 years since the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878", adding that "like the Victorian sewers which we have upgraded or replaced, this Bill replaces Victorian legislation with a new modern legal framework." The bill covered the management of water supply and sanitation, not wider environmental issues surrounding water resources.
In September 2004 Cullen's successor, Environment Minister Dick Roche, also of Fianna Fáil, defended the proposed bill in Dáil Eireann. There he was faced with charges that the bill was a "Trojan horse to introduce privatisation and domestic water charges". The Opposition also criticized the lack of a statutory right of access to water in the bill, lack of public participation in the review of proposed strategic plans, calling the bill "a thinly disguised attempt to privatise the water supply" as well as "a formula to get around the 1997 Act and re-introduce water charges by another name." Ultimately, the bill was not passed.
According to one commentator, if the Water Services Bill, 2003, had been passed earlier and implemented effectively, people would not now have had to boil their drinking water in Galway in 2007 because of an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis.
2007 Water Services Act.
In May 2007, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition enacted the Water Services Act 2007. As well as updating and consolidating existing legislation, the Act also:
Fianna Fáil-Green Party government (2007-2011) policy.
In 2008, the Minister for the Environment, John Gormley, Green Party leader and former Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1994–1995 during the water charges conflict, said that domestic water charges will not be introduced during the lifetime of the government. He also said water shortages will be a key issue that Ireland will have to grapple with in the future. The Minister said there were other ways of tackling potential shortages which have already left some larger urban areas – particularly Dublin – struggling to meet demand during prolonged dry spells. The main focus of government policy would be to reduce the leakages from main water supply pipes.
In October 2009, however, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party agreed on a Renewed Programme for Government, which pledged to introduce domestic water charges based on a system of a free allowance per household, with charges only on usage in excess of the allowance. In October 2010, the administration’s ‘National Recovery Plan 2010-2014’ pledged that metering would form part of charges. Metering was to be introduced by 2014. As part of the EC-ECB-IMF Programme of Assistance to Ireland, agreed in November 2010, the Coalition agreed to the introduction of domestic water charges in 2012/2013.
Fine Gael-Labour government policy (since 2011).
In March 2011, the new Fine Gael-Labour government’s Programme for Government (2011-2016) contained three commitments regarding water sector reform, to:
In January 2012, the Minister of Environment, Phil Hogan, announced a six-week consultation on a planned fundamental reform of the water sector. Metered domestic water charges would be introduced. A new public utility, Irish Water,would be established and take over responsibilities for water and wastewater services from the local authorities. Independent economic regulation, through the Commission for Energy Regulation, would oversee the new utility’s running costs, infrastructural investment plans and the design and level of domestic and non-domestic water charges.
Domestic water charges are scheduled to commence in October 2014, with households receiving their first bills in Quarter 1 2015, with bills paid for usage in arrears.
In July 2013, Irish Water was legally established and began a national metering programme. Sustaining 1,600 jobs during the three and a half year programme, the company will initially install meters for approximately 1.05 million households. International evidence suggests that metering can lead to water consumption of 10-15% less than those without meters. Irish Water will be able to borrow on commercial markets for capital investment. This will remove borrowing for water services from the general government balance (i.e. the public finances).
From 1 January 2014, Irish Water will become the national water services authority, assuming all responsibilities for water services from local authorities except for those relating to certain rural water services and inspections of wastewater treatment systems. Ireland’s 34 local authorities will continue to provide some water and wastewater services on behalf of Irish Water through a service level agreement. The first agreement is due to last for 12 years (2014-2025). Legislation providing for the transfer of functions, water charges and the economic regulation of water is due to be published and enacted by the end of 2013.

Masonic University

The Masonic University was an educational facility operated by the Grand Lodge of Kentucky in La Grange, Kentucky, located twenty miles northeast of Louisville, in the mid-nineteenth century. Among its faculty was Kentucky Chief Jurist and Confederate spy Thomas Hines, and Robert Morris, the poet laureate of Freemasonry.
History.
The initial money to found the school came from the will of William M. Funk, who left $10,000 for the purpose of such an institution, naming it the Funk Seminary. The Kentucky General Assembly approved of the school and chartered it in 1842. The Grand Lodge of Kentucky took control of it in 1844, and renamed it the Masonic College. It was renamed Masonic University in 1852.
The Masonic University had its greatest era in the 1850s. However, the beginning of the Civil War in 1861 severely crippled it. This is best represented by the departure of the principal of its grammar school, Hines, who left to found the Buckner's Guides, a Confederate force. It was during this time that Rob Morris began running the school (1860). His home, the Rob Morris House, still stands a few blocks southeast of the site of the university.
Eventually the Grand Lodge decided they had better uses for the money used to run the school, selling it off in 1873 in favor of concentrating on the Masonic Widows and Orphans Home, then just established in Louisville.
In 1881 the school finally closed. The building burned to the ground in 1911. The Oldham County Fiscal Court Building now stands at the site.
Operations.
As a means to support the school, a one-dollar donation was requested from each Freemason in Kentucky. Tuition was six dollars, but was waived for students whose father was a Mason and was either very poor, or dead.
The first president of the Masonic University was J.R. Finley, who was paid a yearly salary of $750. Finley traveled throughout the United States from 1844 to 1846 to attain "books, maps, and mineralogical specimens" from various Masonic lodges. The journey also saw fifty-eight new students for the school, including one from Spain and four from France.
Students at the school did not live on campus, but instead boarded in nearby homes. However, they never studied at the homes, but instead in the individual school rooms under the supervision of one of the professors. The schools were nonsectarian; students could attend who had no relationship to a Freemason. The commencement ceremonies, first held on July 23, 1847, were not open to the general public. Subjects taught were reading, writing, math, Greek, Latin, and bookkeeping. It was mandatory for those who attended the university due to charity to learn one of the following: carpentry, coopering, horseshoeing, horticulture, or smithing.

Clerk of the Signet

The Clerks of the Signet were English officials who played an intermediate role in the passage of letters patent through the seals. For most of the history of the position, four clerks were in office simultaneously.
Letters patent prepared by the Clerk of the Patents were engrossed at the Patent Office and then sent by the Secretary of State to receive the royal sign-manual. The duty of the Clerks of the Signet was to compare the signed bills with a transcript prepared by the Clerk of the Patents, and then to rewrite the transcript as a bill of privy signet, which was returned to the Secretary of State to be signed with that instrument.
By the end of the seventeenth centuries, many of the Clerks of the Signet performed their work through deputies, with the office itself becoming a sinecure. The Treasury was given the authority to reduce the number of clerkships in 1832, abolishing one in 1833 and another in 1846. The two remaining posts were done away with in 1851.
List of Clerks of the Signet.
Appointments were not made under the Commonwealth of England until 1655.
Appointments resumed upon the Restoration in 1660, including two of the former officeholders, Warwick and Windebanke.

The Pride of Mid-America Marching Band

The "Pride of Mid-America" is the name of the Ball State University marching band. Consisting of nearly 200 members, it is the largest student organization at Ball State.
History.
The band was first organized in 1926 by Claude E. Palmer, who at that time was the head of the Music Department at the former Ball State Teachers College. In 1945, Robert Hargreaves became the new Director of the Bands, working with Robert Holmes as Associate Director of Bands. The next year, Hargreaves selected Robert Hamilton as the new director. 
In 1950, Herbert Fred was designated Director of Bands. Under his direction, the Ball State Marching Band was one of the first bands in the country to perform drill on the field. In addition, the band began accepting women into the organization, which previously had been only accessible to men.
In the late 50's, Hargreaves appointed Earl Dunn as the new Director of Bands. During the 60's, the band membership grew from 66 to 190, receiving national recognition for its outstanding performances. The marching band even participated in the Inaugural Parade for Lyndon B. Johnson on January 20, 1965. band also performed for presidents Richard Nixon and George H. W. Bush.
By the mid-60's, the band had established a reputation of playing Big Band arrangements for the halftime shows. "The Pride" also appeared in the 1965 and 1967 Grantland Rice Bowl games; in televised performances of the Chicago Bears(1966-8); and in the of the Western Conference. By the end of the 70's, the band had 250 players, and was still growing in both membership and prestige.
In 1984, Joseph Scagnoli became the new director of the Ball State Marching Band. Growing to 300 members, it was the first band in Indiana to perform curvilinear drills on the field. In 1989, the band traveled to Fresno, California for the California Raisin Bowl, and to Las Vegas, Nevada in 1993 and 1995 to perform in the Las Vegas Bowl. "The Pride" also played for the Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, and the Indianapolis Colts.
The marching band became so popular during the 90's it recorded a cassette featuring the Ball State Fight Song, Victory March, and Fanfare. All copies sold out quickly due to its popularity. A compact disc was released in 1998, featuring the Ball State traditional songs and fight songs of the Mid-American Conference. By the end of the decade, Christian Zembower had become the new director.
In 2006, Dr. Thomas Caneva was appointed Director of Bands, and Dan Kalantarian was appointed associate Director of Bands. In 2007, the band executed new drills, debuted a new uniform, and performed for David Letterman (Ball State's most famous alumnus) at the inauguration of the new Letterman Communication and Media Building. They also performed a pregame and half-time show at Indiana University and had an appearance at the International Bowl in early 2008.
The band's other appearances included an Indianapolis Colts game at the new Lucas Oil Stadium, an appearance at the MAC Championship in Detroit, Michigan, and a trip in early 2009 to Mobile, Alabama for the GMAC Bowl.
Namesake.
The name, "Pride of Mid-America," was first introduced in the 60's by former director Earl Dunn. Some speculations lead to the thought that the name came from the prestige and recognition that the marching band started to have at the time. It was perhaps linked to the sudden growth in number of members during Dunn's direction, or referred to the university's participation in the Mid-American Conference. Nevertheless, where the name was inspired from is not clearly determined.
Today, the name represents Ball State and its traditions, and has become the main title of the marching band. It is also used as an encouragement tool for the members, such as the traditional dismissal after every rehearsal or performance, which goes:
Leader: "Who are we?!"
Band: "Ball State!"
Leader: "Who are we?" 
Band: "Ball State!"
Leader: "What do we have?!"
Band: "PRIDE!"
Leader: "What do we have?!"
Band: "PRIDE!"
Leader: "Let's go, let's go!"
Band: "Let's go, Ball U!"
Organization.
Instruments and auxiliary groups.
"The Pride" consists of a great number of brass and woodwind players, and a limited number of percussion players who are required to audition. As part of the auxiliary, the band currently has a colorguard, but it previously included cardettes and majorettes in past years. As of the 2010 season, the colorguard has 20 members.
Staff.
Director.
The directors of "The Pride" have often changed their duties and responsibilities. As for today, the director is mainly in charge of arranging the music, and writing drill patterns. 
Former and today's directors:
Graduate Assistants.
They often help and shadow the director as part of the graduate work. The current graduate assistants are Dustin Palmer and Bruce McFarland.
Appointed Instructors.
The marching band counts on several instructors to help with the band. They are appointed by the director of bands and/or the assistant director of bands. The band also uses a color guard instructor and a percussion instructor.
The percussion instructor has several duties including instructing the Ball State Drumline by arranging music, directing sectional rehearsals, and practicing drill.
The color guard instructor is responsible for providing and teaching flag and/or dance routine to the group, as well as practicing drill.
Drum Major.
"The Pride" has currently three drum majors. Their current duties include: conduct the band, guide the players, assist the section leaders, and enforce rules and regulations.
Section Leader.
Each instrument section in the band counts on a section leader. Their main responsibility is to help and guide their peers through learning music and drill during rehearsals. They follow any instruction from the director and from the drum major(s).
Equipment Crew.
It is vital for the band to have an equipment crew. They are responsible of taking care of the instruments owned by the university (drums and sousaphones) and help with stadium hardware. The crew is led by the Equipment Manager, a hired individual by the band.
Music and Drill.
Members march drill while playing their instruments on the field. The forms vary depending on the theme that is played or the occasion. As of today, the band performs modern drill with a traditional marching style known as relaxed straight leg (walking style), and forms designs from simple geometric shapes and straight lines, to complex curves, words, and figures.
Pregame.
Part of Ball State football tradition is the pregame show done by "The Pride." In the past, pregame has consisted of:
Half-Time.
"The Pride's" half-time show consists of a variety of music, such as themes from movies and show, popular tunes on the radio, and classics like Michael Jackson and The Beatles. The music is accompanied by interesting drill and formations by the members.
In the Stands.
During the rest of the game, the band cheers on the football team from the stands, occasionally playing traditional tunes such as the Fight Song and Touchdown Tag.

James Knox Taylor

James Knox Taylor (October 11, 1857 - August 27, 1929) was Supervising Architect of the United States Department of the Treasury from 1897 to 1912. His name is listed "ex officio" as supervising architect of hundreds of federal buildings built throughout the United States during the period.
Early career.
The son of H. Knox and Mary (Young) Taylor, he was born in Knoxville, Illinois and attended schools in Minnesota. He attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he was a classmate of William Martin Aiken, who would precede him in the position of Supervisory Architect, and Cass Gilbert. After graduation he worked in the New York City office of Charles C. Haight and later with Bruce Price. In 1882 he moved to St. Paul, Minnesota where he formed a partnership with Gilbert, as Gilbert & Taylor. They built many homes and churches. Subsequently they designed the Pioneer and Endicott Buildings. In 1893 he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and formed a partnership with Amos J. Boyden. In 1895 he got a job with Aiken, the Supervisory Architect, as a temporary draftsman. In 1897, following a Civil Service Commission examination, he became the Supervisory Architect, the first architect promoted from within.
Tarsney Act.
In 1893 Missouri Congressman John Charles Tarsney introduced a bill that allowed the Supervisory Architect to hold competitions among private architects for major structures. Competitions under Taylor's supervision included the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, James Farley Post Office, Cleveland Federal Building, U.S. Post Office and Courthouse (Baltimore, Maryland) and U.S. Customhouse (San Francisco, California) (which are all now on the National Register of Historic Places) among others. The competitions were met with enthusiasm by the community but were also marred by scandal, as when Taylor picked his ex-partner Cass Gilbert for the New York Customs House commission. In 1913 the act was repealed.
In 1912, Taylor returned to MIT for two years as director of the department of architecture, then moved to Yonkers, New York, where for several years he continued practicing. In 1928, he retired to Tampa, Florida, where he died the following year.
Selected works.
From 1897 through 1912 Taylor is credited as "supervising architect" for federal buildings constructed during his tenure, a list which includes dozens of post offices, court houses and other structures. Local architects are often credited as well. As the head of a sizable government office, Taylor's direct involvement with any of these projects is open to question.

The Bush Club

The Bush Club is an Australian bushwalking club founded in 1939 in Sydney, New South Wales by the well-known conservationists and bushwalkers Marie Byles and Paddy Pallin. The Bush Club has hundreds of members located in and around Sydney and is affiliated with the Confederation of Bushwalking Clubs NSW and through them with Bushwalking Australia. The club, since inception, has provided a wide range of walks of all difficulties and durations.
History.
The Bush Club was founded in 1939 as an alternative club to the older Sydney Bushwalking Club. Whilst the Sydney Bushwalking Club was successful it predominantly focused on lengthy, difficult walks, often involving several days camping in the wild. Marie Byles felt that there were many people in the Sydney region who wished to walk but who were unable to undertake harder, multi-day walks because of health, family or work reasons - or who simply preferred shorter trips. With the assistance of Paddy Pallin, the Bush Club was founded to provide a club for such people.
Geographical Area of Activity.
The club has walked since inception in all the national park areas surrounding Sydney. Large numbers of walks are performed in The Royal National Park and adjacent areas, the Blue Mountains National Park and the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area and the many national parks of the Hawkesbury River region. A number of urban walks and heritage walks in the inner parts of Sydney are also held. Walks in other countries and walks in other significant national parks around Australia are occasionally organised.
Current activities.
The Bush Club continues to provide walks to its members. Members from within the club suggest and volunteer to lead specific walks, which are then advertised to the membership in a quarterly newsletter. Walks are rated from one star (easiest) to 4 star (hardest) and special 'Less Active Walkers' walks suitable for older, less active members are offered. Special 'Take It Easy' walks are also offered. These are walks of all difficulty levels deliberately taken at a slower pace, the aim of which is to encourage less fit members to try more difficult walks. The club also undertakes canyoning activities in the summer months.
As of August 2008 the club has approximately 600 active members and reported offering 383 walks in the year ended June 2008.

Fibronectin binding protein A

Fibronectin binding protein A (FnBPA) is a "Staphylococcus aureus" MSCRAMM cell surface-bound protein that binds to both fibronectin and fibrinogen.
It is an adhesin which enables "Staphylococcus aureus" ("S. aureus") to adhere to host cells of another organism, and an invasin facilitating its internalisation into these cells. This is true over a range of different cell types. The FnBP alone is capable of providing this invasive property, without the requirement of co-receptors. Even FnBP coated beads have been shown to become internalised into cells
"S. aureus" is able to bind to host cells in the absence of the FnBP, but its adherence and invasive properties are much reduced (up to a 500-fold decrease in number of internalised cells)
Structure.
The FnBP inserts into the cell wall of "S. aureus" by means of a C-terminal LPXTG anchor. Two fibronectin binding domains have been identified - one is present in the C-terminal D repeat region, and one in the N-terminal A region 
Mechanism.
The fibronectin binding protein is able to bind fibronectin present in the extracellular matrix. Similarly, the α5β1 integrin present on host cells also binds fibronectin to create a link to its actin cytoskeleton, binding via the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif present in fibronectin. Fibronectin is able to act as a ‘bridge’ between "S. aureus" and the host cell, with both "S. aureus" and the host cell binding at either end of the molecule, and therefore facilitate adherence.
Clinical significance.
The FnBP is involved in adherence to a wide range of mammalian cells and is hence implicated in various infections. 
It is implicated in the pathogenesis of osteomyelitis, and is the predominant adhesin for adherence to osteoblasts, a cell type present in large quantities within bone. Few "S. aureus" cells become internalised into osteoblasts in the absence of the FnBP 
It is also an important virulence factor in "S. aureus" endocarditis.

Peter J. Taggares

Peter J. Taggares was one of the wealthiest and most influential farmers in Washington state. At his death, his holdings included the largest irrigated potato farm in Oregon and one of the world's largest vineyards. He was also involved in politics, having contributed to numerous candidates from both major US political parties.
Life.
Taggares' father, Peter Taggares (Tagaris), emigrated from Greece at the age of 18. He traveled across the United States, eventually settling in Prosser, Washington, where he farmed and raised his family.
Taggares quit school after the third grade. In 1956, he established a small farm near Othello, Washington. From that beginning he built an agricultural empire in the Pacific Northwest second only to that of JR Simplot. At his death his holdings, estimated to be worth half a billion dollars, included the largest irrigated farm in Oregon and one of the world's largest vineyards. Chef Reddy Corp., which he founded in 1964, became one of the nations largest producers of French fries.
On his farm every piece of equipment was painted white. This extended from his tractors, potato diggers, and potato trucks to his corporate jet, Mercedes, Cadillacs and yacht. On his farm in Othello, Washington, even the telephone poles are white.
Involvement in politics.
Although Taggares maintained a low profile outside of the agricultural community, he was frequently involved in politics and was frustrated by the government's inability to make decisions. He was a campaign contributor. In 1997 he was fined $52,500 (the largest such fine in Washington State history) for illegally contributing money to political candidates, much of it in the names of his employees.
Commodities trading.
In the mid-1970s, Taggares and his competitor, J. R. Simplot, were involved in the largest default in the history of American commodities futures trading. The incident, which led to a fine and temporary suspension from futures trading, nearly destroyed the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Samuel Beckett Bridge

Samuel Beckett Bridge () is a cable-stayed bridge in Dublin that joins Sir John Rogerson's Quay on the south side of the River Liffey to Guild Street and North Wall Quay in the Docklands area.
Design and construction.
The architect is Santiago Calatrava, a designer of a number of innovative bridges and buildings. This is the second bridge in the area designed by Calatrava, the first being the James Joyce Bridge, which is further upstream.
Constructed by a "Graham Hollandia Joint Venture", the main span of the Samuel Beckett Bridge is supported by 31 cable stays from a doubly back-stayed single forward arc tubular tapered spar, with decking provided for four traffic and two pedestrian lanes. It is also capable of opening through an angle of 90 degrees allowing ships to pass through. This is achieved through a rotational mechanism housed in the base of the pylon.
The shape of the spar and its cables is said to evoke an image of a harp lying on its edge. (The harp is a secular icon for Ireland and things Irish.)
The steel structure of the bridge was constructed in Rotterdam by Hollandia, a Dutch company also responsible for the steel fabrication of the London Eye. The steel span of the bridge was transferred from the Hollandia wharf in Krimpen aan den IJssel on May 3rd, 2009, with support from specialist transport company ALE Heavylift.
The bridge, which cost €60 million, is named for Irish writer Samuel Beckett, was officially opened to pedestrians on 10 December 2009 by Dublin Lord Mayor, Emer Costello and to road traffic at 7 am the following day.
Criticism.
Since launch, both the location of the bridge and the traffic management provisions in place have attracted criticism; with commentators noting that improvements could be made, and that traffic management restrictions that prevent certain turns onto the bridge, are designed to force drivers to use the East-Link Toll Bridge.

Gang Ranch

The Gang Ranch is a Canadian ranch in the Chilcotin region of the Central Interior of British Columbia. It is located north of Clinton on the west bank of the Fraser River opposite the Indian Reserve community of Dog Creek. The ranch, near Alkali Lake, was founded in 1863. For many years the largest ranch in North America, it is now the second-largest in Canada, after the Douglas Lake Ranch. The Churn Creek Protected Area is also nearby.
Two American brothers, Thaddeus and Jerome Harper, traveled from Harpers Ferry, Virginia, via California, to British Columbia in the Cariboo Gold Rush. They mined in Yale, and lived in Victoria for a time. At one point, they were accused of supporting the rebel Confederacy and plotting against the nearby North. One account suggests that they were asked to leave the border area of British Columbia. Some miners worked their way up the Fraser River seeking gold and found the remote plateau. Unsuccessful in their search for gold, the Harpers settled on the west bank of the Fraser River in 1863 and installed a gang plow. Thus the Gang Ranch began its long operation. 
The Harpers made an agreement with the Chilcotin Indian Kalalest whereby the land at the confluence of the Chilcotin and Fraser rivers was divided between the First Nations and the Harpers. The Harpers began to drive cattle from Washington or Oregon, hundreds of miles on the hoof, northwards to feed the hungry gold miners. One drive was made from Utah. The brothers bought and sold stock and land, moving frequently at first. The town of Horsefly was first called "Harper's Camp" and included a steam sawmill. From their gains with the cattle drives, the brothers expanded the Gang Ranch.
The Harpers had misfortune, including a severe winter in 1878 which killed thousands of cattle. Despite this, the brothers persevered. In 1883, they bought of Chilcotin land from the government. The brothers also had rangeland at Hat Creek, Cache Creek and Kamloops, in all about . The ranch first operated under the name "Canadian Ranching Company". The brothers ran into financial difficulty and the Western Canadian Ranching Company was sold to an English partner, Galpin, of the Cassell publishing house, in 1891.
Considerable work was needed: fencing pastures and building sawmills, bridges, bunkhouses,and roads. At the same time, they had to oversee the feeding, droving, and rounding-up of thousands of head of cattle in rough terrain. With the goodwill and assistance of the Chilcotin people, the ranch grew and prospered. Families such as Gaspard, Paternaude, Farwell and Kalalest settled in the area.
The English owners continued with the ranch for decades, into the twentieth century. A combination of absentee landowners, salaried English managers, isolation, and rough BC bush meant that the business was not always profitable. The hardscrabble way of the ranch, combined with the hard work of developing a business in raw territory, was costly. Then the Depression and the market crash took its toll. The English owners eventually sold the ranch, but not before introducing English farming practices to the area, and English housewares and furniture to the "Big House" on the premises.
In the late 1970s, the ranch was bought by Alsager Holdings. This was the first time in many years that the ranch had been Canadian owned and television news crews came out several times from Vancouver, to cover the story of the ranch's Canadian ownership and subsequent fall into receivership. Dale Alsager and his wife lived on the ranch in a house they built at the headquarters. Lonnie Jones was then manager and cow boss. He rode and made camp with the cowboy crew. Bob Munsey from Paulina, Oregon was the cow boss before Lonnie Jones took over.

Peter Hately Waddell

Peter Hately Waddell (19 May 1817 – 5 May 1891) was a Scottish cleric and prolific writer.
Life.
Waddell was the son of James Waddell of Balquhatston, and was born at Balquhatston House, Slamannan, Stirlingshire on 19 May 1817. His father soon afterwards disposed of the property and removed to Glasgow, and Waddell was educated in the high school and at the university of Glasgow. He was a student of divinity at the time of the disruption of 1843 of the Church of Scotland, and then cast in his lot with the seceders, who afterwards formed the free church of Scotland. Having been licensed as a preacher, in 1843 he was ordained as minister of Rhynie, Aberdeenshire, and in the following year he removed to Girvan, Ayrshire, to the pastorate of a small free-church congregation. His attachment to the free church was loosened when he found that its members intended to retain in the entirety the rigid definitions contained in the Westminster "confession of faith". He had outgrown his early Calvinistic training, and, finding himself at variance with the church of his adoption, he voluntarily resigned his charge, and founded an independent chapel at Girvan styled ‘the Church of the Future,’ defining his aims and intentions in a discourse with the same title, published in Glasgow in 1861. Many of his congregation left the free church and joined with him. Waddell remained at Girvan till 1862, when he went to Glasgow, and began preaching in the city hall as an independent minister. He soon gathered a large congregation, and in 1870 a church was erected for him in East Howard Street, Glasgow. Financial difficulties led to the abandonment of this building, and Waddell once more gathered a congregation by preaching in the Trades Hall. In 1888, at the request of friends and adherents, he joined the established church. Advancing years compelled him to retire from the ministry in October 1890, and he then began to make selections from his published works to form a volume. The task was not completed when his death took place at Ashton Terrace, Dowanhill, on 5 May 1891. He graduated D.D. from an American university.
Works.
Waddell was an orator of very exceptional power. His skill as a dialectician was displayed in a series of lectures on Ronan's ‘Life of Jesus,’ delivered in Glasgow City Hall before large audiences in 1863, and afterwards published. His profound admiration for Burns led to his issuing a new edition of the powers with an elaborate criticism (Glasgow, 1867–9, 4to). He presided at the meeting held in Burn’s cottage on 25 January 1859 in celebration of the poet’s birth, and then delivered an impassioned eulogy on Burns.
His chief historical work was a volume entitled "Ossian and the Clyde", in which he sought to confirm the authenticity of the Ossianic poems by the identification of topographical references that could not be know to Macpherson. He also contributed a remarkable series of letters to a Glasgow journal on Ptolemy’s map of Egypt, showing that the discoveries of Speke and Grant had been foreshadowed by the old geographer. He took a keen interest in educational matters, and was a member of the first two school boards in Glasgow. His most original contribution to literature was a translation of the Psalms of David from Hebrew into the Scottish language, under the title "The Psalms: frae Hebrew intil Scottis", in which he showed his profound linguistic knowledge. This work was followed in 1870 by a similar translation of Isaiah. In the early part of his career he attracted much notice by lectures which he delivered in London and the principal Scottish towns. Between 1882 and 1885 he edited the Waverley novels with notes and an introduction.

<doc id="19098817" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19098817" title="Welsh syntax">
Welsh syntax

The syntax of the Welsh language has much in common with the syntax of other Insular Celtic languages. It is, for example, heavily right-branching (including a verb–subject–object word order), and the verb for "be" (in Welsh, "bod") is crucial to constructing many different types of clauses. Any verb may be inflected for three tenses (preterite, future, and unreality), and a range of additional tenses are constructed with auxiliary verbs and particles. Welsh lacks true subordinating conjunctions, and instead relies on special verb forms and preverbal particles to create subordinate clauses. There are two registers of Welsh, "Literary Welsh" and "Colloquial Welsh"; this article primarily describes Colloquial Welsh.
Word order.
The usual Welsh word order is verb–subject–object. In addition to a verb and a subject, which are obligatory in a canonical clause, Welsh typically organizes additional information as follows:
Focus.
Welsh has a highly-developed system of fronting constituents in focus in which parts of a sentence can be moved to the front for emphasis, rather than stressing them phonetically as English does. Most elements of a sentence can be moved to sentence-initial position.
The subject of a verb causes a soft mutation.
Sentence elements following "yn", such as verbnouns, lose the "yn" when moved initially:
Nominal syntax.
Determiners precede the noun they modify, while adjectives generally follow it. A modifier that precedes its head noun often causes a mutation, and adjectives following a feminine noun are lenited. Thus:
See "Colloquial" and/or "Literary Welsh morphology" for more precise details on the mutations and the environments that trigger them.
Genitive relationships are expressed by apposition. The genitive in Welsh is formed by putting two noun phrases next to each other, the possessor coming second. So English "The cat's mother", or "mother of the cat", corresponds to Welsh – literally, "mother the cat"; "the project manager's phone number" is – literally, "number phone manager the project". Only the last noun in a genitive sequence can take the definite article.
Verbal syntax.
Syntax with "bod".
"Bod" "be" is used for a number of constructions, including equating two noun phrases, using adjectives predicatively, and forming a wide range of grammatical tenses.
Noun and adjective complements.
One way to equate noun phrases is to use what King (2003) calls "identification forms" of "bod", with the word order NP1 – "bod" – NP2
Alternatively, a verb-initial word order may be used, with the "affirmative forms" of "bod" and a particle "yn" which triggers the soft mutation: "bod" – NP1 – "yn"+SM – NP2. This construction has both interrogative and negative variations which utilize different verb-forms and require, in the case of the negative, the addition of "ddim" "not".
The predicative adjective construction uses this same verb-initial construction: "bod" – NP – "yn"+SM – adjective.
Verb complements.
In addition to the inflected preterite, future, and conditional tense forms, "Bod" + subject + "yn" + verbnoun (with no mutation) is used to express a range of other times:
While the present and imperfect have special interrogative and negative forms, the future and conditional forms:
All of these "bod" constructions may be given perfect meaning by replacing "yn" with "wedi" (lit. "after"), while substituting "newydd" (lit. "newly") for "wedi" (together with lenition of the verbnoun) expresses what may be termed the immediate perfect ("has just", etc.). Thus:
Syntax without "bod".
Welsh has inflected preterite, future, and conditional tenses. These do not take any particle such as "yn", but instead soft mutation occurs after the subject: "Welson ni gi?" "We saw a dog" (where "gi" is the lenited form of "ci" "dog"). In negative sentences the soft mutation is instead placed on "dim" "not": "Welson ni ddim ci" "We didn't see a dog".
Questions are formed the same way as with the future and conditional "bod" forms above, as are negative statements "except" when there is a "specific" noun phrase functioning as the direct object. A specific noun phrase is a pronoun ("fi", "nhw", etc.), a definite noun ("yr ardal", "y ffilm", etc.), or a noun preceded by a definite adjective ("fy nhad", "ei chalon hi", etc.). In these cases, "ddim" is replaced by "mo" (a contraction of "ddim o"). Thus:
The preterite, future, and conditional can also be formed with the appropriate inflected tense of "to do" with a verbal noun (again with soft mutation after the subject). The preterite may also be formed with (which is the third person singular preterite of "to happen"), which does not alter its form.
For affirmative statements with inflected verbs, it is particularly common to attach "mi" or "fe", preverbal particles which trigger the soft mutation:
The passive voice can be expressed with the verb "cael" "get" followed by the verb noun modified by a possessive adjective. For example:
The agent is introduced with the preposition "gan" "with, by". A "static passive", expressing the result of an action, can be expressed with the verb "bod" "be" followed by the preposition "wedi" "after" and, again, the verbal noun modified by possessive adjective. For example:
The prepositional phrase can also be used attributively:
The construction can be negated by replacing "wedi" with "heb" "without".
Subordination.
Relative clauses.
There are two relative pronouns in Welsh, "a" and "y". "A" is used in 'direct' relative clauses, i.e. those where the relativised element is the subject of its clause or the direct object of an inflected verb (rather than a periphrastic construction with "bod").
"A" cannot coexist with "mae". Instead, a special form, "sydd" or "sy", is used:
In all other cases, known as 'indirect' relative clauses - those where the relativised element is genitival or the object of a preposition, "y", the complementizer, is used.
Note that because the object of a verbnoun is genitival, all periphrastic constructions take "y".
Complementization.
Syntactic complementization.
Welsh has a number of complementizers used under different circumstances. "Y" is used in all non-focused affirmative clauses other than the present periphrastic with "bod":
The present periphrastic with "bod" tends to use a construction with the verbnoun "bod" in a genitival construction with the subject of the subordinate clause:
Negative clauses can be made negative normally or by replacing "y" with "na":
Focused clauses are complementized with "mai" or "taw":
Focused clauses can be made negative with "nad", or made negative normally (with "mai nid" or "mai dim"):

Augustus, Prince of Anhalt-Plötzkau

Augustus of Anhalt-Plötzkau (Dessau, 14 July 1575 – Plötzkau, 22 August 1653), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the unified principality of Anhalt. From 1603, he was ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Plötzkau.
Augustus was the fourth son of Joachim Ernest, Prince of Anhalt, but second-born son of his second wife Eleonore, daughter of Christoph, Duke of Württemberg.
Life.
In 1586, after the death of his father, Augustus inherited Anhalt jointly with his half- and full brothers under the regency of the eldest, John George I.
After seventeen years of joint rule, the surviving brothers agreed to a formal division of their lands in 1603. Augustus received Plötzkau, which was created from parts of the old principality of Anhalt-Bernburg.
In 1611 he proposed publishing the two Rosicrucian manifestos together, but was unable to locate a copy of "Confessio".
From 1621 until 1642, Augustus acted as regent in Anhalt-Zerbst for his infant nephew John VI, and from 1650 until 1653 in Anhalt-Köthen for another infant nephew, William Louis.
Marriage and issue.
In Ansbach on 25 January 1618 Augustus married Sibylle (b. Laubach, 19 October 1590 - d. Plötzkau, 23 March 1659), daughter of John George I, Count of Solms-Laubach. They had eight children:

Marine Accident Investigation (MAI) is the process of detailed and systematically examining and investigating marine accidents relating to ships or other marine crafts, in order to determine the causes of the accident (collision, fire/explosion, grounding, foundering, and other) and suggest recommendations to avoid accidents in the future. Marine accident investigators have both national and international professional organizations.
IMO requires all flag States of their registered ships to investigate and report serious marine accidents.
National Administration usually assign their Professional Investigators conduct marine accident investigation by interview of witnesses, collect evidences and data for accident analysis, the probable causes and findings of the accident are concluded and recommendation are suggested to prevent future occurrence of similar accident in the final accident investigation report for public.
Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) are now installed on most of the ocean going vessel according to the IMO requirement, VDR have made a substantial contribution to the understanding of accident causes and the improvement of safety. Recorded data has enabled accident investigators to reconstruct events to identify precisely what went wrong and to ensure that effective, rather than convenient, more reliable recommendations can be made to prevent the same thing happening again from the correct lessons learned.

O Clássico

O Clássico ("The Classic") is the name given in football to any match between S.L. Benfica and F.C. Porto. Originally, the term "O Clássico" only referred to games disputed in the Primeira Liga, but now tends to take into account matches that take place between these two sides in other domestic competitions such as the Taça de Portugal, Taça da Liga and Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira. Despite being the two most successful Portuguese clubs in European football with nine International titles shared between both of them, they have never faced each other in a European competition. Benfica and Porto are two of the three clubs which are labelled as the Big Three in Portugal.
The rivalry comes about as Lisbon and Porto are the two largest cities in Portugal, and the two clubs are two of the wealthiest, currently the most successful and influential football clubs in Portugal. The animosity between these two sides also extends from the country's political, cultural and sporting history.
Rivalry.
The first match between the "Águias" and the "Dragões" was an exhibition game that was played on the 28 April 1912, where Benfica defeated Porto 8–2. Eight years later, Porto would win their first "Clássico", after beating their rivals Benfica 3–2. Porto would have to wait another nine years to accumulate their second victory over Benfica. Prior to the establishment of the Primeira Liga in 1934, both Benfica and Porto were competing within their football league district. Both sides were also competing in the Campeonato de Portugal which later became in 1938 the Taça de Portugal.
Up until 1934, Benfica would win the Campeonato de Lisboa nine times as well as triumphing in the Taça de Honra de Lisboa twice, whilst Porto would win the Campeonato de Porto nineteen times as well as claiming the Taça de Honra de Porto twice. Benfica would meet Porto for the very first time in an official match in the domestic cup competition which during the early periods of Portuguese football was the Campeonato de Portugal. Benfica defeated Porto in the final of the 1931 Campeonato de Portugal, 3–0 at the Campo do Arnado in Coimbra. Two from Vítor Silva and one from Augusto Dinis sealed the win to claim Benfica's second Campeonato de Portugal.
The inception of the Primeira Liga, saw Porto win the very first edition of the competition. Both sides met for the very first time in the competition on the 3 February 1935, where Porto triumphed over their rivals 2–1. Benfica would win the return tie 3–0. Despite Benfica's win, the "águias" would finish third in the league, three points behind Porto. The next five seasons would see Benfica win three and Porto win two league titles. When the 1940s arrived, both sides would take a back seat to Sporting CP, who would win five league titles in a decade.
The late 1950s and 1960s saw Benfica dominate not just Portuguese football but also European football. The arrival of Eusébio saw Benfica secure eight league titles in the space of ten years. Benfica's league titles were joined by two consecutive European Cups which were won in 1961, 3–2 against Barcelona, and in 1962, 5–3 against Real Madrid. The 70s saw the continuation of Benfica's dominance up until the 1977–78 season, where Porto secured the league title for the first time in nineteen years. The 80s and early 90s saw both Benfica and Porto battle for the league title. Porto's resurgence and the introduction of Pinto da Costa as chairman saw Porto reach new heights, winning the European Cup for the first time after beating Bayern Munich, 2–1 in the 1987 European Cup Final. Three years later Benfica reached its eight European final, the 1990 European Cup Final, where it lost to Milan 1–0.
In the 1990s, the "dragões" began to dominate Portuguese football, winning a record five consecutive league titles. The intensity between these two sides in the 90s was culminated by the fact that former Portuguese international team mates, João Vieira Pinto who played for Benfica and Paulinho Santos who played for Porto publicly declared their dislike for each other. The new millennium saw a continuation of Porto's dominance. Porto would reach the heights of their 1987 European Cup final win after José Mourinho guided the "dragons" to the UEFA Cup in 2003 and the UEFA Champions League in 2004. Benfica won the league title in 2005, for the first time in over ten years to halter Porto's momentum. Over recent years, both sides have battled out for top spot. The rivalry has intensified over recent years due to Benfica's Cristian Rodríguez switching alliances to Porto in the summer of 2008. He became the third Benfica player in recent history to have switched allegiances to Porto. In 2010, after four seasons, Benfica won its 32nd championship thus establishing a new Portuguese record.
In recent history, Benfica beat Porto 3–0 in 2009–10 Taça da Liga final and conquered the first of its fourth consecutive League Cup (establishment a new record), a trophy that Porto has never won in six editions. In the next year, Porto recorded their biggest home win over the "águias", after defeating Benfica 5–0 in a league fixture. Porto would secure a treble in the same season in which they claimed league and cup as well as the UEFA Europa League.

<doc id="19099003" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19099003" title="Ny Tid (Trondheim)">
Ny Tid (Trondheim)

Ny Tid was a Norwegian newspaper established in 1899 by the typographers Joh. Halseth and Alf Scheflo at the same time as they established their own printing office in Trondheim. The publishers meant to create a worker's newspaper, not a socialist paper. When the first issue came out on 20 September, the newspaper was an organ of the Liberal Party of Norway, but the paper quickly became socialist and thus an organ of the labour movement and later the Norwegian Labour Party in Trondheim when the labour movement took over the paper in July 1900. The paper was first released weekly, but from 1902 on it was released daily.
The purpose for publishing was to propagandize the publishers' political view. Martin Tranmæl was a member of the first editing committee as a 20 year old, and in 1906 became the editor of the paper. He held the position of editor until 1918, when he became party secretary for the Norwegian Labour Party. 
It was under Tranmæl that the newspaper expanded. After Tranmæl left as editor, "Ny Tid" became a radical opposition newspaper.
In 1921, the Norwegian Labour Party split, creating a Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway. The social democrats established their own newspaper, "Trøndelag Social-Demokrat", but this had little effect on the circulation of "Ny Tid". The second party split, which came in 1923, ended with the communists becoming a large percentage of the party in Trondheim; they thereby retained the party's property, including "Ny Tid" which became an organ for the Communist Party of Norway. The Labour Party in Sør-Trøndelag established the year after "Arbeider-Avisen".
"Ny Tid" marketed themselves in the 1930s as an opponent of the Nazis and Fascism. After the Spanish Civil War broke out, Ny Tid wrote on their front page ""Lys fascismen og krigen i bann. Fram til antikrigs og antifascistmøte i morgen på Reina"".
The circulation of "Ny Tid" fell along with the communist's lowering support, especially after Johan Nygaardsvolds cabinet came to power in 1935. The Nygaardsvold government created increased support for the Norwegian Labour Party in Nygaardsvold's part of the country; the Arbeider-Avisen profited from this. 
In March 1939, "Ny Tid" was shut down while having competition from "Arbeider-Avisen".
NKP's increased popularity after the Second World War, gave a resurrected circulation to "Ny Tid". The newspaper continued circulating until July 1945, but shut down for the second time in eight years in May 1947.

HMAS Geraldton (FCPB 213)

HMAS "Geraldton" (FCPB 213), named for the port city of Geraldton, Western Australia, was a "Fremantle" class patrol boat of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).
Design and construction.
Starting in the late 1960s, planning began for a new class of patrol boat to replace the "Attack" class, with designs calling for improved seakeeping capability, and updated weapons and equipment. The "Fremantle"s had a full load displacement of , were long overall, had a beam of , and a maximum draught of . Main propulsion machinery consisted of two MTU series 538 diesel engines, which supplied to the two propeller shafts. Exhaust was not expelled through a funnel, like most ships, but through vents below the waterline. The patrol boat could reach a maximum speed of , and had a maximum range of at . The ship's company consisted of 22 personnel. Each patrol boat was armed with a single 40 mm Bofors gun as main armament, supplemented by two .50 cal Browning machineguns and an 81-mm mortar, although the mortar was removed from all ships sometime after 1988. The main weapon was originally to be two 30-mm guns on a twin-mount, but the reconditioned Bofors were selected to keep costs down; provision was made to install an updated weapon later in the class' service life, but this did not eventuate.
"Geraldton" was laid down by North Queensland Engineers and Agents at Cairns, Queensland on 3 May 1982. She was launched on 22 October 1983, and commissioned into the RAN on 10 December 1983.
Fate.
"Geraldton" was decommissioned on 7 October 2006. She was taken apart for scrap in Darwin.

The Best Recipe

The Best Recipe is a series of cookbooks produced and published by "Cook's Illustrated" magazine based on both content from the magazine as well as original content created for the books. The titular first book in the series was published in 1999 in conjunction with the first season of the "America's Test Kitchen" television show and claimed 700 recipes; it was followed by many others, each with a different subject emphasis. The flagship book was revised and republished in 2004 as "The New Best Recipe" (ISBN 0936184744), and paperback reprints of older books (often with changed titles) began in 2006.
Content.
The books follow a format roughly similar to the magazines, with each recipe introduced by a fairly lengthy commentary on how the editors developed the recipe and various issues of kitchen science involved in perfecting it. Sidebars include equipment and ingredient evaluations, as well as illustrations of specific techniques; most volumes also contain a series of color plates illustrating finished dishes. The original "The Best Recipe" also contained a short section of miscellaneous recipes as well as a description of recipes tied into the first season of the "America's Test Kitchen" television show; these features do not appear in later books. 
Unlike series such as "Foods of the World" with a more encyclopedic format, the "Best Recipe" series is published as self-contained books providing broad coverage of a specific subject. As a result, recipes are often duplicated between books (for example, identical recipes for American-style cornbread appear in at least three different volumes, and chicken tikka masala in at least two), a controversial approach that has led many reviewers to complain of editorial laziness or reduced value. 
Subjects.
The "Best Recipe" books cover numerous genres:

Diesel Traction Group (NZ)

The Diesel Traction Group (DTG) is the Christchurch-based operator of a fleet of ex-New Zealand Railways Department diesel-electric locomotives. The fleet represents a full collection of New Zealand locomotive classes built by the English Electric Company and is a historically significant collection of early New Zealand diesel traction. All of the DTG's locomotives are owned by individual members through the sale of shareholdings.
History.
The DTG was formed in September 1983 to preserve one of the DG class locomotives that were being withdrawn from service at the time. DG 772 (TMS DG 2255) was purchased from NZR and moved to Ferrymead on 17 October 1983. During 1984, the DTG investigated purchasing a second DG, this time one of the ten that were fitted with a new cab during their last major overhaul in the early 1980s, but the proposal did not proceed. 
In 1988, DG 772 was upgraded to main line mechanical certification condition, repainted in its original colour scheme and used in the Ferrymead 125 celebrations, including a mainline excursion to Springfield. Further mainline charters to Dunedin, Clyde and Arthurs Pass followed.
The Group's second locomotive was Drewry TR 22 (TMS TR 91), one of the early designs of the TR class which entered service in 1939. It was offered for sale by tender and was delivered to Ferrymead in July 1985 without an engine or transmission. These vital items of equipment were purchased separately from NZR stores the following year and after installation into the locomotive, it was recommissioned into service a year after its arrival. TR 22 was then placed on lease to the Ferrymead Railway as a light shunter, and was later sold to the railway's operators.
In November 1987, the Group's members purchased two DE class locomotives, DE's 511 and 512 (TMS DE 1412 and DE 1429), from Dunedin where they had been recently withdrawn from shunting duties. They were delivered to Ferrymead with other rolling stock the same month. DE 511 was repainted in the original colours and certified to mainline mechanical standard for participation in the Ferrymead 125 event the following year, which included shared operation of the Springfield excursion with DG 772. Following this, DE 511 was used occasionally in service on the Ferrymead Railway. DE 1429 retained its latter-day TMS number and colours in preservation, and had its engine overhauled in 1989-1990. It is in regular use on a variety of duties at Ferrymead.
In 1989, the DTG purchased DI class locomotive DI 1102 (TMS DI 1820), along with a number of spare parts and a complete diesel engine from class leader DI 1100 (TMS DI 1808), which was then being scrapped at Hutt Workshops. Following the completion of DG 772 in 2009, the DTG has turned their attention to restoring this locomotive to working order for use on the main line.
In 2009, the DTG was named as the custodians of FRONZ's English Electric DF class locomotive, DF 1501, after it was removed from its plinth in Auckland at the request of the site owners, scrap dealer Sims PMI. The locomotive was towed south in January 2009, and the DTG have stated their intention is to restore DF 1501 to working order at some time in the future. At present, the locomotive is receiving preventative maintenance, and will be displayed in the National Railway Museum of New Zealand. 
Location.
The DTG is based at Ferrymead Heritage Park, and their locomotives are used on passenger trains and heavy shunting services on the Ferrymead Railway. In the past, the group's locomotives have also ventured out onto other heritage/tourist railways and charters on the national rail network or visited other heritage railways. The DTG is a member of the Federation of Rail Organisations of New Zealand.
DTG Fleet.
Wagons.
The DTG also possesses a small collection of five ex-NZR goods wagons, several of which are loaned by the Rail Heritage Trust.

<doc id="19099145" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19099145" title="Northwestern Cycleway">
Northwestern Cycleway

The Northwestern Cycleway (sometimes also referred to as the North West or Northwestern Cycle Route) is a 12 km mostly off-road cycle route connecting the Auckland CBD in Auckland City with Henderson, Waitakere City in New Zealand. For most of its length, it runs alongside the Northwestern Motorway (State Highway 16).
The cycleway is used (as of March 2013) by approximately 800 users daily at the St Lukes Road intersection, approximately 750 daily at the Great North Road intersection, and approximately 650 daily at the Te Atatu intersection (some but not all users would have been counted at all three locations). For the St Lukes Road intersection, this represents a 70% growth since regular counts started in 2007. 
History.
The original path was built by Waitakere City Council and Auckland City Council on land leased from Transit New Zealand. It originally only connected from Te Atatu to Waterview, before being extended in the early 2000s a further 5 km east towards the city, with a new overbridge over Great North Road, completed in 2004, connecting these two original sections.
Kingsland upgrade.
In November 2009, the NZTA started construction on a missing section in the Kingsland area, where cyclists to this point were forced to detour through a hilly residential area. The project was to cost $3m for approximately 1.2 km length, including several new planned side accesses (five side accesses were eventually constructed). Costs are relatively high due to the need to work around underground services, and to bridge Mountain View Road where it crosses under the motorway. After completion of the path itself, fences and noise walls will be replaced, and landscaping replanted. 
The new path section was opened in April 2010, costing $3.7 (though much of this cost was in fact for new motorway noise walls for local residents) and was very well received by cyclists and the local cycle advocacy groups Cycle Action Auckland.
Western & CBD extension.
NZTA intends to improve and extend the path further northwest (from its current termination in Henderson up to Westgate in the coming years, as part of the planned Waterview Connection motorway upgrades. The works will include improving path widths and reducing occasional flooding of the cycleway on the low-lying causeway.
Separate from the Waterview upgrades, as part of the Lincoln Road Interchange works, NZTA has also announced that it will extend the cycleway a further 2 km further west, from its current end at Central Park Drive to Huruhuru Road Overbridge.
Together with Auckland Council, NZTA is also extending the path eastwards towards the Auckland CBD, through Spaghetti Junction, a project which was also supported by the Auckland Regional Council / Auckland Regional Transport Authority. A preliminary alignment was assessed for the cycleway to cross Spaghetti Junction and then continue to the university area in the east of the CBD via Grafton Gully. The extension was originally hoped to be in place as early as 2012, with later extensions to the waterfront not ruled out.
In May 2012, it was confirmed that construction was expected to start near the end of 2012 for up to $10 million, though it is hoped to be constructed for less. The project's expected benefit-cost-ratio was $4.6 for every $ invested. The extension will reach 2.1 km from the current end of the cycleway at Upper Queen Street to Beach Road, though a further $3 million stage, that included an upgrade of the existing section along Ian McKinnon Drive, was deferred for now.
In November 2012, construction on the NZTA section of the cycleway extension began, to be completed 2014, with a Beach Road section, linking the new cycleway extension to Quay Street / Tamaki Drive to be constructed by Auckland Transport for $1.5 million by 2015.
Link to SH20 / Waikaraka Cycleways.
In May 2011, the Board of Inquiry hearing the resource consent process for the Waterview Connection decided that NZTA was to set aside $8 million for the construction of an off-road surface cycleway between SH16 and the existing SH20 section in Hillsborough, as part of the tunneling project. This will create a connection between the Northwestern Cycleway and the SH20 and Waikaraka Cycleways.
User growth.
A cyclist count study for the Auckland Regional Transport Authority found that at the Great North Road section of the cycleway, the average daily number of users in 2008 was 532, a gain of 59% compared to the year before. In 2010, this success trend continued, with an increase of 70% over the 2007 levels to over 600 cyclists.

Frederick Mann

Sir Frederick Wollaston Mann KCMG (2 May 1869 – 29 May 1958) was the chief justice of the Australian state of Victoria between 1 October 1935 and 31 January 1944. He was also Victoria’s lieutenant governor between 12 May 1936 and May 1945. Mann was nicknamed the “Little Gentleman” because of his height (he was 168 cms) and he was unfailingly courteous. He had a reputation of being a careful judge delivering decisions of precision and clarity. In 1935, he became the first Australian born person to become chief justice of Victoria.
Early years.
Mann was born at Mount Gambier, South Australia. He was the son of Gilbert Hill Cheke Mann and Sophia Charlotte Mann (nee Wollaston). Mann’s maternal grandfather was John Ramsden Wollaston, a pioneering Anglican archdeacon in Western Australia. Mann’s younger brother was to became an icon of early Australian radio broadcasting. Mann began his education at Christ Church Grammar School in Mount Gambier. Later he transferred to the public education system when he transferred to Mount Gambier Public School. After leaving school, he studied privately at home.
He left South Australia and moved to Melbourne in 1887 where he obtained work as a tally clerk. He then worked as a clerk in the Crown Law Department of the Victorian Government. Whilst working, he studied at the University of Melbourne and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1894. In 1895 he won the Supreme Court prize at the University of Melbourne. He completed his Bachelor of Laws in 1896 and a Master of Laws in 1898. He was called to the Victorian Bar in 1896 but continued working for the State Government rather than practice in his own right.
Military service.
He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 4th Victorian Battalion of the Australian Imperial Regiment known as the “4th Vic.Imperial Bushmen “ He departed Melbourne on 1 May 1900 in the transport “Victorian’. He served in the Boer War for sixteen months until he was wounded at Hartbeesfontein on 16 February 1901. He was awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal. On his return to Australia in November, he set up chambers in Melbourne as a barrister. As a barrister, he specialized in both common law and Equity cases, and became known for his “careful cross-examination technique”. 
On 8 April 1911 he married Adeline Mary Raleigh at All Saints Church of England in East St Kilda. They had five children from the marriage.
Judicial career.
On 22 July 1919, Mann was appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria. In 1931 he became the Chairman of the Court of Industrial Appeal and held that appointment until 1933. He was knighted in the King's Birthday Honours of June 1933, formally receiving his knighthood by Letters Patent on 12 July 1933. Between 1923 and 1934, he acted as Chief Justice of Victoria on many occasions. He was appointed Chief Justice in 1935 in succession to Sir William Irvine. In the same year he became president of the Melbourne Club. In 1936, he denounced Victorian police criminal investigation methods of the time as “crude, untrained and overly reliant upon informers and physical coercion”. Police at that time were tempted to obtain convictions through extorting confessions rather than through investigation.
On 30 March 1936 he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Victoria, taking office on 12 May 1936. The Melbourne newspaper “The Sun” described him as 'lucid, fearless, cold, crisp, alert, analytical, unostentatious and retiring … dignified and decorous'. Mann was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the Coronation Honours of 1937. In 1941 Mann heard the matter of Trustee's Executors & Agency Co Ltd v Reilly. In that case, he was called upon to decide what the phrase “in respect of” meant. He said:
“the words ‘in respect of’ are diffecult (sic) of definition, but they have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connection or relation between the two subject matters to which the words refer”. 
Mann’s dictum in that case on the definition of the meaning of the words “in respect of” is still used today. 
Mann retired as chief justice in January 1944 and retired as lieutenant-governor in May 1945. In later years he became a trustee of the Melbourne Botanical Gardens Maud Gibson Trust. He died in 1958 at his home in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra.

Cross River (British Columbia)

The Cross River is a tributary of the Kootenay River in the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is part of the Columbia River basin, as the Kootenay River is tributary to the Columbia River.
The history regarding this river and Whiteman's Pass across the Continental Divide begins with James Sinclair leading a party of Red River immigrants through the pass in 1841. They left Fort Garry (now the city of Winnipeg) in 1841 with 23 families, including a 75-year-old woman, with an aim to settle in the Oregon Country to reinforce British claims to the area. After a brief stop at Fort Edmonton, he was guided by Maskepetoon, the chief of the Wetaskiwin Cree, via Lake Minnewanka to the present site of Banff, Alberta where the Spray River joins with the Bow River and then south up the Spray River valley where the reservoir now lies. They trekked up the Spray River, then along a tributary, White Man's Creek, and across the Great Divide at White Man's Pass. In his book "The Place of Bows," E.J. Hart suggests that although the party was made up largely of Metis, the presence of a few men from the Maritimes, "seem to account for the name 'Whiteman's' being attached to the pass."
The Reverend Robert Terrill Rundle was also in the area in 1841. After camping at the confluence of the Bow and Spray rivers, Rundle explored the Spray Valley where it parallels the mountain that now bears his name (Appleby 1975).
In 1845, Father Pierre-Jean De Smet, a Jesuit priest, came east from Lake Windermere via the Kootenay River and one of its tributaries to the summit of White Man's Pass "where all was wild sublimity". He erected a large cross on the pass. Father De Smet and British Army Lieutenants Henry James Warre and Mervin Vavasour are said to have met near the summit. Few Europeans were travelling in the Canadian Rockies at this time and it was a remarkable coincidence that the two parties met (Esther Fraser, "The Canadian Rockies" wrote that Warre and Vavasour "probably" used this pass).
Father De Smet built a cross that he referred to as the, "Cross of Peace" near the summit of the pass, and the river which drains the west side of the pass was henceforth known as the Cross River. From White Man's Pass, de Smet travelled down the Spray River, which was "jewelled with enamelled beads", and on out to the foothills (Fraser 1969). He wrote, "The Christian's standard, the cross has been reared at the sources of these two rivers. May it be a sign of salvation and peace to all the scattered and itinerant tribes east and west of these gigantic an luid mountains." The river's indigenous Nakoda ("Stoney") name, Tsha-kooap-te-ha-wap-ta, alludes to the cross erected near the river by Pierre-Jean De Smet in 1845.
Lts. Warre and Vavasour were travelling eastward, returning from a secret mission to determine if troops could be dispatched through the mountains to defend British interests in the southwestern part of the Columbia District. The trip had been encouraged by Sir George Simpson Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company. Warre and Vavasour reported that the mountain passes were unsuitable for troop transport. Of this pass and others, they wrote: "Without attempting to describe the numerous Defiles through which we passed, or the difficulty of forcing a passage through the burnt Forests, and over the high land, we may venture to assert, that Sir George Simpson's idea of transporting troops. . . with their stores, etc. through such an extent of uncultivated Country and over such impracticable Mounatins would appear to Us quite unfeasible."
Course.
The Cross River originates in Kootenay National Park on the west slopes of the Continental Divide near White Man Pass, Alberta a tributary of the Spray River/ It flows generally south and west, picking up the waters of Mitchell River from the north, before emptying into the Kootenay River.

Rudolph, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst

Rudolph of Anhalt-Zerbst (Harzgerode, 28 October 1576 – Zerbst, 30 July 1621), was a German prince of the House of Ascania and ruler of the unified principality of Anhalt. From 1603, he was ruler of the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst.
Rudolph was the fifth son of Joachim Ernest, Prince of Anhalt, but third-born son by his second wife Eleonore, daughter of Christoph, Duke of Württemberg.
Life.
In 1586, after the death of his father, Rudolph inherited the principality of Anhalt jointly with his half- and full brothers, but because he was still a minor, his older brother John George I acted as regent.
By the accounts of contemporary witnesses, Rudolph was an eager pupil and student. In 1596 the twenty-year-old prince was invited to the coronation of King Christian IV of Denmark in Copenhagen.
His Grand Tour began in 1600 when he arrived in Sicily. With his younger brother Louis, Rudolph spent a year in Florence. On 21 November 1601 he was admitted to the University of Siena. A year later, in 1602, the prince left Switzerland (where he had lived for some time) and returned to Dessau.
In 1603, a formal division of the principality of Anhalt was agreed upon by Rudolph and his surviving brothers. He received Zerbst, where his main residence was, and supported there the renovation of the "Gymnasium Francisceum", beginning with the addition of a library. In 1618, Rudolph joined the Fruitbearing Society.
Marriages and Issue.
In Wolfenbüttel on 29 December 1605 Rudolph married Dorothea Hedwig (b. Wolfenbüttel, 3 February 1587 - d. Zerbst, 16 October 1609), daughter of Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. They had four daughters:
The death of his wife caused Rudolph to fall into a deep depression, according to contemporary witnesses.
In Oldenburg on 31 August 1612 Rudolph married for a second time to Magdalene (b. Oldenburg, 6 October 1585 - d. Coswig, 14 April 1657), heiress of Jever and daughter of John VII, Count of Oldenburg; only when Rudolph met her did he find a way out of his depression. They had two children:

Artisan cheese

Artisanal cheese refers to cheeses produced by hand using the traditional craftsmanship of skilled cheesemakers. As a result the cheeses are often more complex in taste and variety. Many are aged and ripened to achieve certain aesthetics. This contrasts with the more mild flavors of mass-produced cheeses produced in large scale operations, often shipped and sold right away.
Part of the artisanal cheese making process is aging and ripening of the cheeses to develop flavor and textural characteristics. One type of artisanal cheese is known as farmstead cheese, made traditionally with milk from the producer's own herds of cows, sheep, and goats. Artisan cheeses may be made by mixing milk from multiple farms, whereas the more strict definition of farmstead cheese (or farmhouse cheese) requires that milk come only from one farm.

RealFlight

RealFlight is a radio-controlled airplane and helicopter simulation software series created by Knife Edge Software and published by Great Planes. The software allows for the flying of numerous aircraft with simulated physics so that the user can get an attempted real-life flying experience.
Included in the software are various flying sites (or airports) and aircraft models, almost all of which represent real-life models. The software also includes an airport editor and an aircraft editor to allow for the creation of new flying sites and aircraft. Within RealFlight, editing aircraft is limited to changing the physical and aerodynamic properties. In order to create new visual models, the use of a 3D modeling application such as Autodesk 3ds Max or Blender is required.
The software is released in "generations," with each new generation including major updates and new features. The most recent is RealFlight Generation 6, which included additions such as water and water physics, an improved user interface, more aircraft, more flying sites, and an improved "InterLink Elite" controller. RealFlight requires the connection of an InterLink controller, which is included with the software, in order to operate.
Add-Ons and Expansion Packs.
Knife Edge Software also develops packs containing additional content for RealFlight, each of which adds new airfields and additional aircraft. For users of RealFlight G4 or newer, the older series of "Add-On" packs have been reworked, with several aircraft receiving updates, and can be downloaded freely from the RealFlight website.
The "Add-Ons" volumes, which are no longer officially supported, have been superseded by the newer "Expansion Pack" series of products. The Add-Ons line is compatible with versions of RealFlight dating back to RealFlight Classic, with the exception of Add-Ons 5, which requires RealFlight G2 or higher. Expansion Pack 1 through Expansion Pack 4 require RealFlight G3 or higher, and Expansion Pack 5 and up require RealFlight G4 or higher. Expansion Packs 1 through 3 are now discontinued products.

Boyce was on the run for one year and eight months until US Marshals and FBI Agents captured him in the small town of Port Angeles, Washington on August 21, 1981, ending one of the most extensive and complex manhunts in the history of the US Marshals Service.

Henry Guinness

Henry Seymour Guinness (24 November 1858 – 4 April 1945) was an Irish engineer, banker and politician.
Engineering career.
Born at Burton Hall, Stillorgan, County Dublin, his father Henry's home, Guinness was educated at Winchester College and then the Royal Indian Engineering College, and worked as an engineer in the Indian Public Works in 1880–95. He served as a lieutenant in the Burma State Railway Volunteer Rifles in the Third Anglo-Burmese War. Back in Ireland he was a director of the Great Northern Railway in 1902–24, director of the Bank of Ireland, and assistant managing director at Guinness in 1924–30.
Public life.
He was appointed High Sheriff of County Dublin in 1899. A supporter of the Irish Unionist Alliance until 1921, he was chosen to represent the Irish business world as a Senator in the Senate of Southern Ireland, which failed to function. 
During the Irish War of Independence Guinness arranged for the Sinn Féin led Dublin Corporation to be funded by the Bank of Ireland, as rates due from the Local Government Board had been withheld in 1920. W. T. Cosgrave chaired the British-run Local Government Board finance committee for Dublin, while being at the same time the Minister for Local Government of the Irish Republic. In 1951 he recalled that "I went to the Bank of Ireland and there interviewed two of the Directors, H.S. Guinness and Andrew Jameson. They eventually gave the accommodation so urgently required for the Corporation. It was for this reason that when President of the Executive Council at a later stage, I nominated these two gentlemen as Senators."
Guinness was elected as an independent member of the first Irish Senate ("Seanad Éireann") of the new Irish Free State for 12 years at the 1922 election. He supported measures such as a regular financial system and also the proposal by W. B. Yeats for the local translation of ancient Irish manuscripts. He did not seek re-election in 1934.
Personal life.
He lived at Burton Hall, Stillorgan, for many years. In March 1923, during the Irish Civil War, the anti-Treaty republicans tried to burn it down, without success.
He married Mary Bainbridge in 1900 and they had 4 children. His father Henry (1829–93) had been the Dublin manager of the Guinness Mahon bank.
Guinness was also the first to write a number of essays and short books on the history of the Guinness family. The originals and supporting notes are at the National Library of Ireland.

Ivan Lyakhov

Ivan Lyakhov (), died around 1800, was a Russian merchant who explored large sections of the New Siberian Islands in the 18th century.
Lyakhov began his explorations in the spring of 1770 on dogsleds in order to explore the islands off the northern Siberian coast reported by Yakov Permyakov and Merkury Vagin in 1710. In this journey he visited the southern section of the New Siberian Islands. Lyakhov's intentions were mainly commercial, for he hoped to find mammoth ivory. His theory was that both the islands he explored, and which were later named after him Lyakhov Islands, and those he sighted in the distance but was not able to explore, were mainly formed by a substratum of bones and tusks of mammoths.
Lyakhov went on another exploratory venture to the New Siberian Islands in 1773-1774. He visited again the Lyakhov Islands, crossed the Sannikov Strait and discovered Kotelny Island.
Lyakhov undertook his last expedition in 1775. This time there was a scientific background to his explorations, for he brought along with him a land surveyor. During this journey Great Lyakhovsky Island (Большой Ляховский) was thoroughly surveyed and described.

Johann Goldfuß

Johann Goldfuß (December 11, 1908 Wildstein Austria-Hungary (now Skalná, Czech Republic) – July 3, 1970 Schwandorf, Bavaria, Germany) was a German luthier.
Born in Bohemia, he studied his craft with Mathias Heinicke, who was one of the main representatives of the school of luthiers of Saxony-Bohemia. Johann Goldfuß worked with Heinicke for 17 years, becoming himself a master craftsman. His work was interrupted during World War II, when he was drafted and then taken prisoner of war. 
When he was released, in 1949, he found out that his family had been expelled from Czechoslovakia and had moved to Schwandorf, Bavaria. He started his craft again, first repairing violins and eventually opened a new workshop for violins. His wife Katharina was able to go back to Czechoslovakia and to smuggle to his new homeland the tools which had been left behind. He built over 300 violins, violas and cellos which were known for the outstanding uniformity of their sounds. Concerned about the acoustic improvement of his instruments, in 1969 he used for the first time the golden ratio in the design of violins.
He founded the "Geigenbau Goldfuss" company which specializes in the production of violins and string instruments which have gained recognition for their high quality and are used by violinists in concerts all over the world. Besides the production of string instruments, Johann Goldfuß is also known for his restoration of classical violins. He died of a heart attack on July 3, 1970.
The company founded by Johann Goldfuß was taken over by his son Horst Goldfuß and has since moved to Regensburg.

7.7 cm Infanteriegeschütz L/20

The 7.7 cm Infanteriegeschütz L/20 was an infantry gun used by Germany in World War I. It was designed by Krupp to rectify the shortcomings of the 7.62 cm Infanteriegeschütz L/16.5.
Krupp mounted a shortened 7.7 cm Feldkanone 96 n.A on one of their mountain howitzer carriages. It fired the full range of ammunition of the FK 96 n.A., but generally only with a reduced charge, although it retained the capacity to fire the old full-power charges that gave a maximum muzzle velocity of 435 m/s (1427 ft/s). It also used a new full-power anti-tank round. Generally it broke down into two loads for transport, although it could break down into a maximum of eight loads.
While generally liked by the troops it was thought to be too heavy and slow to break down and reassemble. The German search for a better infantry gun that maximized use of existing components continued with Krupp's 7.7 cm Infanteriegeschütz L/27.

Scrubs (clothing)

Scrubs are the shirts and trousers or gowns worn by surgeons, midwives and other operating room personnel when "scrubbing in" for surgery. In the United Kingdom, they are sometimes known as Theatre Blues. They are designed to be simple with minimal places for contaminants to hide, easy to launder, and cheap to replace if damaged or stained irreparably. The wearing of scrubs has been extended outside of surgery in many hospitals. Originally issued as replacement clothing if street clothing was contaminated, scrubs are now worn by any hospital personnel in any clean environment. The spread of Methicillin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus" (MRSA) has increased the use of scrubs but can give wearers a false sense of security that they are 'clean' when in fact are as easily contaminated as any other clothing. They have also been mandated in some American prisons as a prison uniform. The television show "Scrubs" is partly named for this garment.
History of surgical attire.
In contrast to the uniforms long required of nurses, surgeons did not wear any kind of specialized garments until well into the 20th century. Surgical procedures were conducted in an operating theater. The surgeon wore his own clothes, with perhaps a butcher's apron to protect his clothing from blood stains, and he operated bare-handed with non-sterile instruments and supplies. (Gut and silk sutures were sold as open strands with reusable, hand-threaded needles; packing gauze was made of sweepings from the floors of cotton mills.) In contrast to today's concept of surgery as a profession that emphasizes cleanliness and conscientiousness, up to the early 20th century the mark of a busy and successful surgeon was the profusion of blood and fluids on his clothes. The importance of dress as a badge of one's class in society was paramount and the processes behind the transmission of infection were the subject of controversy within the profession.
With the "Spanish flu" pandemic of 1918 and the growing medical interest in Lister's antiseptic theory, some surgeons began wearing cotton gauze masks in surgery; however, this was not to protect the patient from intra-operative infection, but to protect the surgeon from the patient's diseases. Around the same time, operating theatre staff began wearing heavy rubber gloves to protect their hands from the solutions used to clean the room and equipment, a practice surgeons grudgingly adopted.
By the 1940s, advances in surgical antisepsis (now called aseptic technique) and the science of wound infection led to the adoption of antiseptic drapes and gowns for operating room use. Instruments, supplies and dressings were routinely sterilized by exposure to either high-pressure steam or ethylene oxide.
Originally, operating room attire was white to emphasize cleanliness. However, the combination of bright operating lights and an all-white environment led to eye strain for the surgeon and staff. By the 1950s and 1960s, most hospitals had abandoned white operating room apparel in favor of various shades of green, which provided a high-contrast environment, reduced eye fatigue, and made bright red blood splashes less conspicuous. 
By the 1970s, surgical attire had largely reached its modern state — a short-sleeve V-necked shirt and drawstring pants or a short-sleeve calf-length dress, made of green cotton or cotton/polyester blend. Over this was worn a tie-back or bouffant-style cloth cap, a gauze or synthetic textile mask, a cloth or synthetic surgical gown, latex gloves, and supportive closed-toe shoes. This uniform was originally known as "surgical greens" because of its color, but came to be called "scrubs" because it was worn in a "scrubbed" environment.
In many operating rooms, it is forbidden to wear any exposed clothing, such as a t-shirt, beneath scrubs. As scrubs are designed to promote a clean environment, the wearing of outside clothing is thought to introduce unwanted pathogens.
Modern scrubs.
Today, any medical uniform consisting of a short-sleeve shirt and pants is known as "scrubs". Scrubs may also include a waist-length long-sleeved jacket with no lapels and stockinette cuffs, known as a "warm-up jacket". Nearly all patient care personnel at hospitals in the United States wear some form of scrubs while on duty, as do some staffers in doctor, dental, and veterinary offices. Doctors in the United States may wear their own clothes with a white coat except for surgery. Support staff such as custodians and unit clerks also wear scrubs in some facilities. When the medic is not performing surgery the scrub is typically worn under the White coat.
Colors and patterns.
Scrubs worn in surgery are almost always colored solid light green, light blue or a light green-blue shade, although some medical centers have switched to pink as a theft deterrent. Surgical scrubs are not owned by the wearer; due to concerns about home laundering and sterility issues, these scrubs are hospital-owned or hospital-leased through a commercial linen service.
Non-surgical scrubs come in a wider variety of colors and patterns, ranging from official issue garments to custom made, whether by commercial uniform companies or by home-sewing using commercially available printed patterns.
Some hospitals use scrub color to differentiate between patient care departments (i.e. Surgery, Labor and Delivery, Emergency, etc.) or between licensed patient care personnel (nurses, radiological technicians, respiratory and physical therapists, etc.), unlicensed assistive personnel, and non-patient care support staff (i.e. portering, dietary, unit clerks, etc.). Hospitals may also extend the practice to differentiate non-staff members/visitors.
Custom made printed scrub tops, featuring cartoon characters and cheerful prints are common in pediatricians' offices, veterinary offices, dental clinics and children's hospitals, while prints for various holidays can be seen throughout the year. Some acute care facilities or larger hospitals also have relaxed rules regarding the wear of non-regulation scrubs in non-surgical units, and they are no longer just the classic v-neck scrub tops, but are now offered in many different styles and patterns.
Some scrubs are found in custom colors, e.g. a university hospital may have scrubs in the school's colors.
External wear.
In the UK, all NHS hospital trusts have stringent clothing policies, and many of these specifically forbid the wearing of the iconic white coat for medical staff, owing to infection control concerns. This has meant that several hospitals around the UK have opted for scrubs for staff, especially in Accident and Emergency departments.
As an item of casual dress, scrubs have gained acceptance outside of hospitals, for example, as pajamas, workout clothing, or loungewear. They are sometimes used by backpackers in an effort to reduce weight load. Large stencils with the hospital's name or logo imprinted on them (commonly on pockets or at knees) are designed to prevent theft due to their increased popularity as casual wear.
Scrub caps.
Scrub caps have graduated from being functional to also being a personalized accessory both in the operating room and outside. Before the antiseptic focus of the 1940s, hats were not considered essential to surgery. From the 1940s through the 1950s, as a hygienic focus swept the industry, hats became standard wear to help protect patients from contaminants in hair. Full-face hats were even designed for men with beards. These hats have been and continue to be distributed by group purchasing organizations (GPOs) who supply hospitals with most equipment.
In the medical fashion 'revolution' of the seventies, more and more medical professionals began personalizing their scrubs by either sewing their own hats or buying premade hats made of eclectic fabric. Several styles were popular, including the 'bouffant' surgical cap, a utilitarian hairnet-like hat which typically comes in light blue, and the 'milkmaid', a bonnet-like wrap around hat.
Bouffant surgical caps are perhaps the most widely used scrub hats in hospitals, and their usage is not limited to only nurses and surgeons: hospital patients are required to wear a bouffant cap when having surgery of any kind.

Anachronisms in the Book of Mormon

There are a variety of words and phrases in the Book of Mormon that are considered anachronistic—their existence in the text of the Book of Mormon is at odds with known linguistic patterns, archaeological findings, or known historical events.
Each of the anachronisms is a word, phrase, artifact, or other concept that critics, historians, archaeologists, or linguists believe did not exist in the Americas during the time period that the Book of Mormon claims to have been written in.
Latter Day Saint scholars and apologists respond to the anachronisms in several ways.
The list below summarizes the most prominent and problematic anachronisms, as well as perspectives by Mormon apologists, and rebuttals.
Background.
According to Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon was originally engraved on golden plates, which he received in 1827 from an angel named Moroni, whom Smith identified as a resurrected inhabitant of the American continent. Smith claimed to translate the original text into English, from what the text of the book says is "Reformed Egyptian". The book itself was published in 1830.
The Book of Mormon is claimed to represent the history of some part of the Americas, and its inhabitants, from c. 2500 BC to 400 AD, thus putting it within the pre-Columbian era.
Critics claim that its origin lies firmly in the 19th century, and that Smith created the book with the resources available to him, including the King James Version of the Bible.
Unlike the Bible, no manuscripts in the supposed original language of the Book of Mormon are known to exist. No Reformed Egyptian manuscripts or plates have ever been excavated by archaeologists. 
Historical anachronisms.
Quoting Isaiah.
Book of Mormon prophets in the Americas quote chapters 48–54 of the Book of Isaiah after having left the Jerusalem area around 600 BC. Since Isaiah died around 698 BC, under traditional biblical belief, there would be no conflict. However, recently, many Biblical scholars assert that these chapters were not written by Isaiah, but rather, by one or more other people during the Babylonian captivity sometime between 586 and 538 BC (between 14 and 82 years after it could have been known to Lehi and his family).
Baptism.
Baptism is mentioned as a ritual that is taught and performed among the Nephite civilization, with its first mention being taught by Nephi between 559 and 545 BC. However, baptism as a ritual as described in the Book of Mormon (i.e., as a one time cleansing ritual that also grants membership to the church) is widely believed to be unknown until its institution in early Christianity many hundreds of years after the practice was ostensibly taught and practiced as related in the Book of Mormon. The first known mention of baptism in this form is by John the Baptist. A similar incarnation of the practice of baptism was practiced by the Jewish group the Essenes between the 2nd century BC and the first century AD.
Flora and fauna anachronisms.
Horses.
Horses are mentioned fourteen times in the Book of Mormon, and are portrayed as an integral part of the cultures described. There is no evidence that horses existed on the American continent during the 2500–3000 year history of the Book of Mormon (2500 BC–400 AD). Horses evolved in North America, but are believed to have become extinct on the American continent at the end of the Pleistocene. Horses did not reappear in the Americas until the Spaniards brought them from Europe. They were brought to the Caribbean by Christopher Columbus in 1493, and to the American continent by Cortés in 1519.
Apologists assert that there is fossil evidence that some New World horses may have survived the Pleistocene–Holocene transition, though these findings are disputed by critics.
Others believe that the word "horse" in the Book of Mormon does not refer to members of the genus "Equus".
FARMS apologist Robert R. Bennett stated that as a comparison, the famed horses of the Huns did not leave an archeological trace yet numbered in the thousands. Bennett also points out the limited evidence of lions in Palestine:
"The biblical narrative mentions lions, yet it was not until very recently that the only other evidence for lions in Palestine was pictographic or literary. Before the announcement in a 1988 publication of two bone samples, there was no archaeological evidence to confirm the existence of lions in that region."
Critics argue that this rebuttal is not applicable since pictographic and literary evidence of horses in the New World (outside of the Book of Mormon) is unknown.
Elephants.
Elephants are mentioned twice in a single verse in the Book of Ether. Mastodons and mammoths lived in the New World during the Pleistocene; however, as with the prehistoric horse, the fossil record indicates that they became extinct along with most of the megafauna towards the end of the last ice age. The source of this extinction is speculated to be the result of human predation, a significant climate change, or a combination of both factors. It is known that a small population of mammoths survived on St. Paul Island, Alaska up until 5725 BP, but even this date is thousands of years before the Jaredite record in the Book of Mormon begins.
The main point of contention is how late these animals were present before becoming extinct.
Various Latter Day Saint authors have cited evidence that North American mound builder cultures were familiar with the elephant. The oldest mound builder societies date to around 2000 BC. The mound builder/elephant controversy did not originate with the Book of Mormon. In "The Mound Builders, Their Works and Relics", author Stephen Dennison Peet cites instances of exhumed mastodon remains and arguments given for why the remains were believed to be contemporary with mound builders. Elephant effigy pipes, of the characteristic mound builder platform style, were reported as archaeological finds in Iowa, and many have readily identified the animal depicted in the shape of the Wisconsin "elephant mound", though others question whether this is in fact the animal represented. The former Iowa state archaeologist Marshall McKusick discusses the evidence indicating that the elephant platform pipes are frauds in his book on the so-called Davenport Tablets.
Critics note that the co-existence of man and elephantine animals is congruent with the archaeological record, but does not address the anachronism, since the dates of all elephantine remains have been placed well before their mention in the Book of Mormon.
There are instances of stories preserved orally by Native Americans which some Latter Day Saint scholars believe may describe elephants. One such story is related by the Naskapi Indian Tribe, located in eastern Quebec and the Labrador region of Canada. The story concerns a monster from the Naskapi tradition called "Katcheetohuskw", which is described as being very large, with large ears, teeth and a long nose. Similar versions of "monster" legends related by other tribes refer to a monster called "Ursida", which is described as more of a large, stiff-legged bear rather than a mammoth. The story of the "monster bear" is considered by some scholars to be purely mythical. Delaware and other native American legends of the “mastodon” are likewise said to exist.
Cattle and cows.
There are six references to "cattle" made in the Book of Mormon, including verbiage suggesting they were domesticated. There has been no evidence recovered that Old World cattle (members of the genus "Bos") inhabited the New World prior to European contact in the sixteenth century AD. 
Apologists argue that the term "cattle" may be more generic that suggesting members of the genus Bos, and may have referred to bison, mountain goats, llamas, or other American species. According to the Book of Mormon, varieties of "cattle" (including goats and sheep) could be found in ancient America. Without these the Nephites could not have kept the Law of Moses, as directed.
Latter Day Saint apologists note that the word "cattle" may refer to the ancestor of the American bison, Bison antiquus (of the sub family Bovinae). Bison antiquus, sometimes called the ancient bison, was the most common large herbivore of the North American continent for over ten thousand years, and is a direct ancestor of the living American bison.
However, no species of bison is known to have been domesticated as the "cattle" in the Book of Mormon are suggested to have been. Furthermore, it is widely accepted that the only large mammal to be domesticated in the Americas was the llama; no species of goats, deer, sheep, or other "cattle" were domesticated before the arrival of the Europeans to the continent. Apologists counter that the wording in the Book of Mormon does not require the "cattle" to have been domesticated in the strictest sense.
Goats.
Goats are mentioned three times in the Book of Mormon placing them among the Nephites and the Jaredites. In two of the verses, "goats" are distinguished from "wild goats" indicating that there were at least two varieties, one of them possibly domesticated, or tamed.
Domesticated goats are not native to the Americas, having been domesticated in pre-historic times on the Eurasian continent. Domestic goats were introduced on the American continent upon the arrival of the Europeans in the 15th century, 1000 years after the conclusion of the Book of Mormon, and nearly 2000 years after they are last mentioned in the Book of Mormon. The mountain goat is indigenous to North America, but it has never been domesticated, and is known for being very aggressive.
Matthew Roper, a FARMS writer, discussed the topic of goats in his article "Deer as 'Goat' and Pre-Columbian Domesticate". He noted that when early Spanish explorers visited the southeastern United States they found native Americans herding tame deer. Quoting an
early historian of Spain, Peter Martyr d'Anghiera, recorded:
"In all these regions they visited, the Spaniards noticed herds of deer similar to our herds of cattle. These deer bring forth and nourish their young in the houses of the natives. During the daytime they wander freely through the woods in search of their food, and in the evening they come back to their little ones, who have been cared for, allowing themselves to be shut up in the courtyards and even to be milked, when they have suckled their fawns. The only milk the natives know is that of the does, from which they make cheese."
Roper also noted early Spanish colonists called native Mesoamerican brocket deer goats. He quotes, "Friar Diego de Landa noted, 'There are wild goats which the Indians call yuc.'" He quoted another friar in the late 16th century, "in Yucatán 'there are in that province ... great numbers of deer, and small goats'".
Swine.
Swine are referred to twice in the Book of Mormon, and the narrative of the Book of Mormon suggests that the swine were domesticated by the Jaredites. There have not been any remains, references, artwork, tools, or any other evidence suggesting that swine were ever present in the pre-Columbian New World.
Apologists note that peccaries (also known as javelinas), which bear a superficial resemblance to pigs, have been present in South America since prehistoric times. Latter Day Saint authors advocating the original mound builder setting for the Book of Mormon have similarly suggested North American peccaries (also called “wild pigs”) as the "swine" of the Jaredites.
Critics rebut that peccaries have never been domesticated.
Barley and wheat.
Grains are mentioned twenty-eight times in the Book of Mormon, including barley and wheat. The introduction of domesticated modern barley and wheat to the New World was made by Europeans sometime after 1492, many centuries after the time in which the Book of Mormon is set.
FARMS apologist Robert Bennett offered two possible explanations for this anachronism:
"Research on this matter supports two possible explanations. First, the terms barley and wheat, as used in the Book of Mormon, may refer to certain other New World crop plants that were given Old World designations; and second, the terms may refer to genuine varieties of New World barley and wheat," states Mr Benett of the Maxwell Institute. "For example, the Spanish called the fruit of the prickly pear cactus a "fig," and emigrants from England called maize "corn," an English term referring to grains in general. A similar practice may have been employed when Book of Mormon people encountered New World plant species for the first time."
Bennett also postulates that references to "barley" could refer to Hordeum pusillum, also known as "little barley", a species of grass native to the Americas. The seeds are edible, and this plant was part of the pre-Columbian Eastern Agricultural Complex of cultivated plants used by Native Americans. Hordeum pusillum was unknown in Mesoamerica, where there is no evidence of pre-Columbian barley cultivation. However, evidence exists that this plant was domesticated in North America in the Woodland periods contemporary with mound builder societies (early centuries AD) and has been carbon-dated to 2,500 years ago.
Honey bees.
In Ether 2:3, it says that the Jaredites
The Mayans used "Melipona beecheii", a stingless bee, for honey, but this is not the same as the true honey bee, which is of the genus "Apis".
Technology anachronisms.
Chariots or wheeled vehicles.
The Book of Mormon mentions the use of chariots as a mode of transportation five times. There is no archaeological evidence to support the use of wheeled vehicles in Mesoamerica. Many parts of ancient Mesoamerica were not suitable for wheeled transport. Clark Wissler, the Curator of Ethnography at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, noted:
This affirmation, however, is not entirely correct. Wheels were used in a limited context in Mesoamerica for what were probably ritual objects, "small clay animal effigies mounted on wheels. Lack of suitable draft animals and a terrain unsuitable for wheeled traffice are the probable reasons that wheeled transport was never developed. 
A comparison of the South American Inca civilization to Mesoamerican civilizations shows the same lack of wheeled vehicles. Although the Incas used a vast network of paved roads (see Inca road system), these roads are so rough, steep and narrow that they appear to be unsuitable for wheeled use. Bridges that the Inca people built, and even continue to use and maintain today in some remote areas, are straw-rope bridges so narrow (about 2–3 feet wide) that no wheeled vehicle can fit (see image and technology at Inca rope bridges). Inca roads were used mainly by chaski message runners and llama caravans. Mayan paved roads at Yucatan had characteristics which could allow the use of wheeled vehicles, but there is no evidence that those highways were used by other than people on foot and nobles who were borne on litters. 
Some apologists have pointed to the discovery of wheeled toys left in tombs. However, several researchers, including W. H. Holmes of the Bureau of American Ethnology, suspect that the toys were introduced into the tombs after the arrival of Europeans on the continent. He stated:
"Charnay obtained from an ancient cemetery at Tenenepanco, Mexico, a number of toy chariots of terra cotta, presumably buried with the body of a child, some of which retained their wheels. The possibility that these "toys are of a post-discovery manufacture" must be taken into account, especially since mention is made of the discovery of brass bells in the same cemetery with the toys." (emphasis in original)
One Latter Day Saint researcher responds to the lack of evidence with a comparison to Biblical archaeology, suggesting that though there are no archaeological evidences that any of the numerous ancient American civilizations used wheeled transportation, few chariot fragments have been found in the Middle East dating to Biblical times (apart from the disassembled chariots found in Tutankhamun's tomb). Although few fragments of chariots have been found in the Middle East, there are many images of ancient chariots on pottery and frescoes and in many sculptures of Mediterranean origin, thus confirming their existence in those societies. The complete absence of these images among the hundreds of frescoes, hundreds of thousands of pieces of decorated pottery and pre-Columbian artwork found in the New World does not support the existence of Old World-style chariots in the New World.
Referencing the discovery of wheeled chariot "toys" in Mayan funerary settings, Mormon scholar William J. Hamblin has suggested that the "chariots" mentioned in the Book of Mormon might refer to mythic or cultic wheeled vehicles.
Silk.
The Book of Mormon mentions the use of silk six times. Silk is a material that is created from the cocoon of the Asian moth "Bombyx mori", and was unknown to the pre-Columbian Americas.
Mormon scholar John L. Sorenson believes that there are several materials which were used in Mesoamerica which the Spanish called "silk" upon their arrival. He alleges that the inhabitants of Mexico used the fiber spun by a wild silkworm to create a fabric.
Compass.
The Book of Mormon also states that a "compass" or "Liahona" was used by Nephi around 600 BC. The compass is widely recognized to have been invented in China around 1100 AD, and remains of a compass have never been found in America. In the Book of Alma when Alma, speaking to his son Helaman, explains "our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass" (). Alma tells his son that "it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ ... to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass ... to the promised land" ().
Apologists counter that the compass used by Nephi (the Liahona) was, according to the narrative, created by God himself (), and not by the Nephites. Also, unlike a normal compass, the Book of Mormon says that there was also writing on the ball that displayed additional instructions from God (). Apologists claim that it is possible that the compass used by the Nephites was not copied or used by the civilization, and as such archaeological evidence of compasses may not exist in the Americas. Based on this theory, Joseph Smith would have chosen the word "compass" in his translation of the golden plates as a best fit for the concept of the compass, and as such it is not necessarily an anachronism.
Windows.
The Book of Mormon describes that the Jaredite people were familiar with the concept of "windows" near the time of the Biblical Tower of Babel (presumably circa 2000 BC. See Chronology of the Bible), and that they specifically avoided crafting windows for lighting in their covered seagoing vessels, because the windows would be "dashed in pieces" during the ocean voyage. Transparent window panes are a more recent invention. The earliest known production of glass dates to 3500 BC in Egypt and Mesopotamia, though the specimens are non-transparent beads. The earliest known production of transparent glass panes is much more recent—dating to the 11th century AD in Germany.
Apologists note that the Hebrew word "חַלּוֹן" ("chalon") translated "window" in Genesis 8:6 in the Bible, refers to an opening or porthole that was covered, but by what is not specified. It is not specifically stated that the window referred to in the Book of Mormon was an opening covered by a transparent material. Latter Day Saint apologists argue that the word "window" simply parallels the language of the King James Bible. They claim that a wooden or other covering might have been "dashed in pieces" by the "mountain waves" that would "dash upon" them, and that even a thick glass casting would not have provided constant light to the interior of the vessels.
Uses of metal.
The Book of Mormon mentions a number of metals, and the use of metal. However, while pre-Columbian tribes used metal, often beaten, there is no accepted evidence of high-temperature smelting. The word "dross" (meaning a by-product of smelting) appears twice in the Book of Alma too; according to Brent Lee Metcalfe:
The Book of Mosiah also mentions "ziff" as a metal, but it is not clear what the identity of ziff might be.
Steel and iron.
Steel and iron are mentioned several times in the Book of Mormon. There is no evidence of steel (hardened iron) production in North, Central, or South America.
Between 2004 and 2007, a Purdue University archaeologist, Kevin J. Vaughn, discovered a 2000-year-old iron ore mine near Nazca, Peru, however there is no evidence of smelting, and the ore (hematite) was apparently used to make pigments. There are other numerous excavations that included iron ore. He noted:
"Even though ancient Andean people smelted some metals, such as copper, they never smelted iron like they did in the Old World... Metals were used for a variety of tools in the Old World, such as weapons, while in the Americas, metals were used as prestige goods for the wealthy elite." 
Apologists counter that the word "steel" may be referring to another alloy of hardened metal such as the hardened copper alloy that is translated with the word "steel" in the King James Version of the Bible. This alloy is in fact a hardened copper similar to bronze and not hardened iron. Though usually more resistant to oxidation than iron, hardened alloys of copper can oxidize. It is therefore not certain that the mention of "rust" is the same as iron oxide.
Metal swords, which had "rusted".
The Book of Mormon makes numerous references to swords and their use in battle. When the remnants of the Jaredite's final battle were discovered, the Book of Mormon narrative states that "the blades thereof were cankered with rust."
Warriors in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica are known to have used wooden clubs with blade-like obsidian flakes, which cannot rust because it is stone.
Apologists counter that most references to swords do not speak of the material they were made of, and that they may refer to a number of weapons such as the macuahuitl, a "sword" made of obsidian blades that was used by the Aztecs. It was very sharp and could decapitate a man or horse. However, this does not explain several references to swords that were explicitly made out of steel, and another metal that was capable of "rusting". Obsidian flakes on a macuahuitl are not capable of rusting.
Some studies have shown that metallurgy did exist in a primitive state in Mesoamerica during the Preclassic/Formative and Classic periods (which corresponds to the time period in the Book of Mormon). These metals include brass, iron ore, copper, silver, and gold. However, the metals were never used to make swords; Vaughn noted:
"Even though ancient Andean people smelted some metals, such as copper, they never smelted iron like they did in the Old World...Metals were used for a variety of tools in the Old World, such as weapons, while in the Americas, metals were used as prestige goods for the wealthy elite."
The closest evidence to a pre-columbian metal blade on Mesoamerica come from The Mayan World, but those artifacts were not swords, but small copper axes, and those were used more as a tool.
Cimiters.
"Cimiters" are mentioned about ten times in the Book of Mormon. The word "cimiter" (scimitar) is considered an anachronism, since the word was never used by the Hebrews (from which the Book of Mormon peoples came from), or any other civilization prior to 450 AD. As with swords, there is no evidence that native American peoples had metal blades.
The word cimiter (scimitar) has at different times referred to a long curved sword used by the Persians and Turks, or a smaller curved knife, similar to the kopis of the Turks, or makhaira of the Greeks.
Apologists, including Michael R. Ash, and William Hamblin of FAIR, note that the Book of Mormon does not mention the materials that the "cimiters" were made out of, and postulate that the word is was chosen by Joseph Smith as the closest workable English word for the weapon used by the Nephites that was not made of metal, and was short and curved.
System of exchange based on measures of precious metals.
The Book of Mormon details a system of weights and measures used by the societies described therein. However, the overall use of metal in ancient America seems to have been extremely limited. A more common exchange medium in Mesoamerica were cacao beans.
Linguistic anachronisms.
Knowledge of Hebrew and Egyptian languages.
The Book of Mormon account refers to various groups of literate peoples, at least one of which is described as using a language and writing system with roots in Hebrew and Egyptian. Archaeological evidence has been found for five or six different Mesoamerican scripts, but archaeological dating methods make it difficult to establish which was earliest (and hence the forebear from which the others developed) and a significant portion of the documented scripts have not been deciphered. None of the documented Mesoamerican language scripts have any known relation to Hebrew or Egyptian. The Book of Mormon describes another literate culture, the Jaredites, but does not identify the language or writing system by name. The text of the Book of Mormon refers only to a language used prior to the alleged confounding of languages at the great tower, presumed to refer to the Tower of Babel.
Linguistic studies on the evolution of the spoken languages of the Americas agree with the widely held model that the initial colonization of the Americas by Homo sapiens occurred over 10,000 years ago instead of during the time frame given in the Book of Mormon.
Some apologists argue that the Book of Mormon does not describe all of the original settlers of the Americas, but rather a subset of the larger population, who settled in a limited geographical setting, and that evidence of the knowledge of Hebrew or Egyptian would be too sparse to be found. Critics note that this is not congruent with past church teachings or the preface to past editions of the Book of Mormon.
"Christ" and "Messiah".
The words "Christ" and "Messiah" are used several hundred times throughout the Book of Mormon. The first instance of the word "Christ" dates to between 559 and 545 BC. The first instance of the word "Messiah" dates to about 600 BC.
"Christ" is the English transliteration of the Greek word Χριστός (transliterated precisely as Christós); it is relatively synonymous with the Hebrew word rendered "Messiah" (). Both words have the meaning of "anointed," and are used in the Bible to refer to "the Anointed One". In Greek translations of the Old Testament (including the Septuagint), the word "Christ" is used for the Hebrew "Messiah", and in Hebrew translations of the New Testament, the word "Messiah" is used for the Greek "Christ". If you take any passage in the Bible that uses the word "Christ", you can substitute for it the word "Messiah" or "the Messiah" with no change in meaning (e.g. ).
The Book of Mormon uses both terms throughout the book. In the vast majority of cases, it uses the terms in an identical manner as the Bible, where it doesn't matter which word is used:
The Book of Mormon occasionally uses the word "Christ" in a way that is not interchangeable with "Messiah". For example in , the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob says an angel informed him that the name of the Messiah would be Christ:"Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that Christ—for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this should be his name—should come among the Jews" () The word "Messiah" was used frequently before this point, but from this point on the word "Christ" is used almost exclusively in the Book of Mormon.
Richard Packham argues that the Greek word "Christ" in the Book of Mormon challenges the authenticity of the work --> since, Joseph Smith clearly stated that, "There was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of the Lord, translated the Book of Mormon."
The Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research states that the word 'Christ' is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word 'Messiah' and Smith simply chose the more familiar Greek word to translate the word that appeared in the language of the plates.
Hugh Nibley postulated that the word "Messiah" could have been derived from Arabic rather than Hebrew, although Arabic is not mentioned as one of the languages in which the golden plates were written.
Greek names.
Joseph Smith stated in a letter to the editor of "Times and Seasons", "There was no Greek or Latin upon the plates from which I, through the grace of the Lord, translated the Book of Mormon." Nevertheless, the Book of Mormon contains some names which appear to be Greek, some of which are Hellenizations of Hebrew names (e.g. Antipas, Archeantus, Esrom, Ezias, Jonas, Judea, Lachoneus and Zenos).
Others Greek names are non-biblical and their presence in the book is puzzling to both believers and skeptics, since neither Smith nor the Nephites spoke Greek. One explanation has been offered by Brian D. Stubbs, who said that though the language of the Mulekites isn't put forward in the Book of Mormon, it could have consisted of Phoenician, Greek, or Arabic.
"Church" and "synagogue".
The word "church" first occurs in 1 Nephi 4:26, where a prophet named Nephi disguises himself as Laban, a prominent man in Jerusalem whom Nephi had slain:"And he servant, supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he did follow me" ().
According to the Book of Mormon, this exchange happened in Jerusalem, around 600 BC. The meaning of the word "church" in the Book of Mormon is more comparable to usage in the Bible than modern English. The concept of a church, meaning "a convocation of believers", existed among the House of Israel prior to Christianity. For instance, Psalms speaks of praising the Lord "in the congregation of the saints"; the Septuagint contains the Greek word "ecclesia" for "congregation," which is also translated as "church" in the New Testament. The Book of Mormon using the word "church" in the same "style" as the Bible is seen by some apologists as support for the Book of Mormon.
A similar question regards the word "synagogue," found in Alma 16:13:"And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people in their temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in their synagogues, which were built after the manner of the Jews" ().
Scholars note that synagogues did not exist in their modern form before the destruction of the temple and the Babylonian captivity. The oldest known synagogue is located in Delos, Greece, and has been dated to 150 BC.
Other anachronisms.
Critics Jerald and Sandra Tanner and Marvin W. Cowan contend that certain linguistic properties of the Book of Mormon provide evidence that the book was fabricated by Joseph Smith.
These critics cite linguistic anachronisms such as:
"Adieu".
The French word "adieu" appears once in the Book of Mormon in Jacob 7:27.
Supporters of the Book of Mormon argue that the text is a translation into modern English, so the use of a French word is not amiss. For example, Daniel H. Ludlow contends that the use of the French word "adieu", and others, may have been the result of Joseph Smith choosing the best word available to convey the meaning of the original text.
Anachronisms apparently perpetuated from the King James translation.
A significant portion of the Book of Mormon quotes from the brass plates, which purport to be another source of Old Testament writings mirroring those of the Bible. In many cases, the Biblical quotations in the English-language Book of Mormon, are close, or identical to the equivalent sections of the King James Version. Critics consider several Book of Mormon anachronisms to originate in the 1611 KJV.
"Satyr".
In 2 Nephi 23:21, the Book of Mormon quotes Isaiah 13:21, which mentions a "satyr". Satyrs are creatures from Greek mythology, which are half-man, half-goat. The King James Bible translates Isaiah 34:14 thus:
Other English-language versions of the Bible, including the New International Version, translate the word שעיר (sa`iyr) as "wild goat"; other translations include "monkey" and "dancing devil".

California Medical Association

The California Medical Association (CMA) is a professional organization representing more than 39,000 physicians in the state of California. The organization was founded in 1856 and is a constituent organization of the American Medical Association.
The CMA is a professional organization representing physicians and surgeons in the state of California. The CMA serves more than 39,000 members in all modes of practice and specialties. The CMA is dedicated to serving its member physicians through a comprehensive program of legislative, legal, regulatory, economic and social advocacy. The CMA's goal is to provide members with the necessary support, so that they can surpass the challenges and continue to run successful medical practices.
History.
The CMA and its leaders:
Organization.
On , the Medical Society of the State of California held its first meeting at Pioneer Hall on J Street in what is now Old Town Sacramento. The society's first president, Benjamin Franklin Keene, M.D.—also a state senator representing El Dorado County—led the meeting of 1875.
After the 1850 cholera outbreak in Sacramento, the surviving physicians became close colleagues and friends, and began to found county medical societies. The first were founded in Sacramento and San Francisco. Each society kept in contact, and society secretaries Thomas Logan, M.D., (Sacramento) and Elias Cooper, M.D., (San Francisco)—historical figures in their own right—set up that landmark first meeting in 1856. Dr. Logan, a notable medical scholar, would later reform the CMA after years of strife, reorganizing the society in 1875 and eventually serving as the state’s Director of Public Health as well as president of the CMA and then the American Medical Association. Dr. Cooper, an eye surgeon and co-founder of the Illinois Medical Society previously, would found the medical school that became Stanford University School of Medicine.
Controversy arose over which physicians were credible, and as a result a credentials committee formed to "prevent admissions of improper persons." Dr. Morse became the Medical Society’s first Censor, a precursor to the Medical Board of California of today.
In the early years, travel was difficult, so that the society's focus remained in Northern California, and its counterpart, the Southern California Medical Society, was not created until 1898. County societies sprouted up throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s. In 1900, CMA membership cost $10 and included malpractice coverage. In 1923, the society renamed itself the California Medical Association to comply with name changes at other state medical associations and the American Medical Association.
John Frederick Morse, M.D., a historian and journal editor for the medical society who would form some of the first disciplinary and licensing terms for state physicians, is credited with starting the first journal of the Medical Society, starting with his own funds a short-lived publication called the California State Journal of Medicine. There were several revivals of publications over the years. In 1873, the society published the first Transactions of the Medical Society of California, a volume published annually until Volume 31, issued in April 1901. In that year it was recommended that, because the annual transactions were "an extravagant and unnecessary way of perpetuating the proceedings of the society, the more rational one of publishing a monthly journal" be adopted. Thus, The California State Journal of Medicine was revived. In 1924 its name was changed to California and Western Medicine, and in 1946 to California Medicine. Philip Mills Jones, M.D., is regarded as that journal’s founder.
In 1974, the journal became The Western Journal of Medicine, in conjunction with a plan to create a regional medical journal for the West. For more than twenty years, The Western Journal served as the official journal for the state medical associations of Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, and six research and specialty societies, in addition to the CMA. In 1998, the Journal was taken over by the British Medical Journal, and has since ceased publication.
Merger with the California Osteopathic Association.
In 1961, the CMA merged with the California Osteopathic Association. At the time, the CMA consisted of 40 medical societies, which were organized by county; after the merger, the COA became the 41st medical society. In 1975, full CMA membership was offered to qualified osteopathic physicians (D.O.). In 1999, the CMA passed a resolution to work with the current osteopathic medical association, Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons of California, on issues that concern both M.D. and D.O. physicians. In 2005, the CMA opposed efforts to consolidate the D.O. and M.D. medical boards.
Medicine.
The physicians who founded the Medical Society of the State of California were veterans in the fight against cholera, encephalitis, typhoid and smallpox—diseases that became prevalent in the newly minted lands of California after the Gold Rush of 1849. They dedicated their organization to "promote the science and art of medicine, protection of public health, and the betterment of the medical profession."
A deadly cholera epidemic struck Sacramento in October 1850. Despite their unfamiliarity with these diseases, physicians remained committed to helping their patients. About 5,000 people in Sacramento and the surrounding areas died of cholera, and thousands of others deserted the area in fear of the disease.
Dr. Morse noted physicians’ remarkable commitment: "Not one educated physician turned his back upon the city in its distress and threatened destruction." The dead in the cholera epidemic included seventeen physicians, a third of the physician population of California. They are memorialized in a plaque at the historic Sacramento City Cemetery, with only one of them buried in a marked grave.
The CMA also helped to establish some of the first blood banks and cornea banks in the West and helped create the California Tumor and Tissue Registry in 1947—what is today the second largest tumor and tissue registry in the world.
Politics and activism.
During the 20th century and beyond, the CMA has fought against tobacco use and smoking and insisted early on—in the face of criticism and fear of the newly found disease—that HIV and AIDS patients deserve needed health care. The CMA continues to advocate for patients on a broad range of health care issues, including broader immunization against disease and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
In 1975, the CMA preserved access to care for many when it forged ahead on a plan to keep medical malpractice rates affordable. Hearing the outcry of CMA physicians who had faced rate increases up to 400 percent, threatening practice viability, Governor Jerry Brown called together a special session of the legislature to discuss the malpractice cost crisis. They passed that year a collection of statutes called the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA), a model for national medical liability reform. At the insistence of CMA physicians, MICRA kept patients whole and ensured compensation for their injuries while setting a cap on non-economic damages, going a long way in keeping malpractice insurance premiums affordable. CMA continues the fight to protect MICRA against a ballot measure funded by trial lawyers.
By the 1960s, it was clear to the CMA that the managed care industry needed oversight and regulation. In the 1970s, the CMA sponsored a key piece of legislation, the Knox-Keene Health Care Services Act. The law instituted financial and quality standards for HMOs, set a basic minimum benefit package, required plans to ensure continuity of patient care, and protected the physician-patient relationship in health care decisions. In 2000, the CMA sponsored AB 1455, which gave the Department of Managed Health Care the authority to levy penalties and fines against health plans that engage in unfair business and payment practices.
While the CMA had made some progress in the Legislature, physicians were frustrated that despite three decades of legislative and regulatory efforts, health plans still ran roughshod over physicians and patients often couldn’t get the care they needed. In 2000, in a historic action, the CMA filed a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) lawsuit against for-profit HMOs in California, alleging that they were using fraud and other illegal activities to interfere in the physician-patient relationship. Eventually, more than 800,000 physicians and 19 state and county medical association’s joined the CMA as plaintiffs, becoming the largest class action health care lawsuit in U.S. history.
Of the 10 defendants, six settled (including the now merged Anthem/Wellpoint/Blue Cross), and three had their cases dismissed by the court. The settling health plans agreed to pay a combined $585 million in monetary damages. But of even greater value were the binding commitments made by the insurers to change the way they do business with physicians. These prospective commitments have been valued far in excess of the monetary relief, at well over $1 billion over four years.
The CMA continues to advocate on behalf of physicians and patients to make sure that health plans are complying with the laws and regulations of the State of California.
Demography.
At the medical society's second annual session in 1857, the Committee on Education declared that at the very least German, French—but especially Spanish—should be part of a medical student’s education, stating: "In no country in the world is there such a national admixture of languages as this State." CMA began on the principles that all patients of all ethnicities should be treated for their illnesses, and the CMA supplied the nation with some of its first ethnic medical leaders. Just as in 1857, the CMA continues to work toward bridging language and ethnic barriers with patients by placing new physicians in underserved areas of the state through the Stephen M. Thompson Loan Forgiveness Program, and studying the effects of limited English proficiency on patient care.
In recent decades, the CMA House of Delegates approved "mode-of-practice" forums to provide representation for physicians based on the type of practice they are in—solo/small group, medium, large and very large group, academic, hospital-based, or government employed. An ethnic physicians' forum also was established.
Today, the California Medical Association has more than 39,000 members in all modes of practice and specialties representing the patients of California.
California Medical Association Foundation.
The CMA Foundation primarily began in 1963 as a charitable arm of the California Medical Association, disbursing over $1 million dollars in grants and loans to medical students. The CMA, while supporting the interests of California's physicians, realized that it was important to help along future physicians during their educational years, and so remained as a source of resources for medical students until 1995, when Dr. Rolland C. Lowe, M.D., CMAF Board Chair, recommended that the Foundation expand its role to encompass community health. 
New projects began in 1996 and 1997, such as ComPACT (tobacco education) and the Physician Leadership Recognition Dinner. These programs established our position in the community as leaders of public health initiatives. The Pharmacy Partnership Project, begun in 1996, gathered pharmacists from across California working in independent pharmacies to remove tobacco products from their stores. We realized a nearly 80% success rate (currently 78% of independent pharmacies in California are tobacco free). In July 2000, the Partnership changed its name to Prescription for Change to encourage chain pharmacies to go tobacco free as well. Overall, the mission of this project is to facilitate public education campaigns, advertisements, and media coverage that focus on increasing consumer awareness about pharmacies selling tobacco.
Beginning in 2000, the CMA Foundation initiated its community involvement by launching the AWARE Project (Alliance Working for Antibiotic Resistance Education), a nationally recognized project. In addition, there are many other health projects, public outreach programs, and physician conferences that point to CMA Foundation's commitment to improving the health of California's residents.
Institute for Medical Quality.
In January 1996, the California Medical Association launched a new not-for-profit subsidiary, the Institute for Medical Quality (IMQ), to help improve the quality of care delivered to patients in California. Some, but not all, IMQ programs involve surveys of facilities and medical practices. Each program is carefully developed and continuously updated by physicians whose practices are similar to those they are evaluating or advising. IMQ is a 501(c)3 corporation.
Audio-Digest Foundation.
The Audio-Digest Foundation is a continuing education provider that was an affiliate of the California Medical Association (CMA). In 2008, it was sold by CMA and is now a Learner's Digest International business.
The organization was established in 1953 and was founded by Jerry Lyle Pettis. It currently employs 70 full-time staff members and is based in Glendale, California. The organization produces continuing medical education/continuing education (CME/CE) audio programs for physicians and health care professionals who subscribe. Programs are published on 15 specialties. These are typically audio tapes of meetings (such as seminars, short courses at universities, conferences and symposia) at which experts present new research.
The organization is accredited to provide continuing education to physicians by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, to nurses (by the American Nurses Credentialing Center's Commission of Accreditation), and to physician assistants (by the American Academy of Physician Assistants, which accepts educational activities by ACCME-accredited organizations up to a certain number of credits).

2008 Bihar flood

It was one of the most disastrous floods in the history of Bihar, an impoverished and densely populated state in India. A breach in the Kosi embankment near the Indo-Nepal border (at Kusaha VDC, Sunsari district, Nepal) occurred on 18 August 2008. The river changed course and inundated areas which hadn't experienced floods in many decades. The flood affected over 2.3 million people in the northern part of Bihar.
Incident.
On 18 August 2008, heavy monsoon rains and poor maintenance caused a breach in the Kosi embankment. Water passed through the breach at an estimated 129,800 m³/s, inundating multiple villages in Nepal and hundreds of villages in northern Bihar. The flood submerged most of the Kosi alluvial fan area, which is very fertile, with a dense agrarian population.
Background.
The Kosi River's upper basin in southern Tibet and eastern Nepal drains some 60,000 km² of mountainous terrain, a region that tectonic forces are elevating by about 1 cm a year. If erosion keeps pace with geologic uplift, an estimated 600 million cubic meters of sediment is potentially carried downstream in an average year. However, empirical measurements of the river's sediment load have yielded estimates of 100 million cubic meters annually, indicating that the area is rising.
River gradient ranges from more than 10 meters/km for major upper tributaries in the mountains to as little as 6 cm/km as the lower Kosi nears the Ganges. As the gradient decreases on the plains, current slows and turbulence that holds sediments in suspension diminishes. Sediments settle out and are deposited on the riverbed. This process eventually raises a channel above the surrounding terrain. The river breaks out, seeking lower terrain, which it again proceeds to elevate by deposition. This creates a cone-shaped alluvial fan. The Kosi alluvial fan is one of the largest in the world, covering some 15,000 km² and extending 180 km from the outermost foothills of the Himalayas to the Ganges river valley.
Flood waters naturally spread out over the surface of this cone. Flows over 25,000 m³/s have been measured where the Kosi exits the Himalayan foothills, enough to create a flow of water 30 km wide. At this rate, in one week enough water would accumulate to cover the entire megafan to a depth of 1.5 meters.
Preventative flood control measures include upstream reservoirs that can also serve irrigation needs and produce hydroelectric power. However, in Nepal these are mostly in the planning stages. The flood control measures mainly consist of downstream embankments meant to confine the river to a fixed channel. In theory, the faster flow along this channel would carry high flows away and keep sediments in suspension. 
On 18 August 2008 one of the man-made embankments failed. The river reverted from the prescribed western channel to an old channel near the centre of its alluvial fan. The river spread out widely and inundated towns, villages, and cultivated fields on the densely populated alluvial fan. Recurrent flooding on the lower Kosi contributes largely to India's history of suffering more flood deaths than any other country except Bangladesh, and has earned the Kosi the epithet "The Sorrow of Bihar".
Affected areas.
India.
Flooding occurred throughout the Kosi River valley in northern Bihar, in the districts of Supaul, Araria, Saharsa, Madhepura, Bhagalpur, West Champaran and Purnea.
The flood killed 250 people and forced nearly 3 million people from their homes in Bihar. More than 300,000 houses were destroyed and at least 340,000 hectares (840,000 acres) of crops were damaged. Villagers in Bihar ate raw rice and flour mixed with polluted water. Hunger and disease were widespread. The Supaul district was the worst-hit; surging waters swamped 1,000 square kilometres (247,000 acres) of farmlands, destroying crops.
Nepal.
It affected six districts in Nepal. Approximately 42,800 Nepalese (7,572 households) were affected by the Koshi floods in Sunsari District, in addition to an estimated 11,000 Indian nationals (2,328 households), according to the Government of Nepal (GoN). Koshi Wildlife Reserve along the Koshi river was severely impacted by the floods including its wildlife and biodiversity. 
Relief and Rehabilitation Work.
In response to the disaster, widely reported as the region's worst flood in 50 years, Nitish Kumar, Chief Minister of Bihar, met Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to seek his help in dealing with the "catastrophe".
The Prime Minister declared a “national calamity” on 28 August and earmarked US$230 million in aid for the region. Rescue operations were carried out by the Indian Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and non-government organizations. Indian Air Force helicopters dropped relief supplies in the worst-hit districts. Mumbai Fire Brigade sent a 22-member disaster management team to help in relief work.
Chief Minister Kumar requested a rehabilitation package of Rs 145 billion from the central government for the flood ravaged Kosi region.
The Bihar government returned funds from Gujarat for relief work because of purported differences with the Gujarat Chief Minister, Narendra Modi.
On 1 September, describing the floods as a “disaster,” the Dalai Lama gave 100,000 rupees to the Bihar government for relief work.
The Government of Bihar initiated Kosi Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Programme covering 30,000 affected families in Saharsa, Supaul and Madhepura district based on a pilot project implemented by ODR Collaborative, a network of organizations, supporting the Government and an owner driven reconstruction policy was formulated to support each family with Rs. 55,000 to construct their own house. After signing an agreement with the World Bank in January 2011, this programme has been upscaled to cover 100,000 families for reconstruction of hazard safe houses. The cost per house will be Rs. 55,000 ($1200) with an additional cost of Rs. 2,300 ($50) for a toilet and Rs. 5,000 ($110) for solar powered lighting. In cases where beneficiaries do not own land, the Government of Bihar will provide additional assistance of Rs. 5000 ($110) for the people to buy the land. Towards this project, the World Bank is contributing $220 million. Technical guidelines have been brought out to enable owners to build houses with various local materials including bamboo.
The Rehabilitation work has been incredibly slow. Out of a total 100,000 houses to be constructed by the Government in the Kosi region comprising Madhepura, Saharsa and Supaul districts, only 12,500 were erected till February 2014.
Administrative lapse.
Fax messages sent by engineers at the Kosi dam warning the state government of the impending disaster went unheeded as the official authorized to respond was on leave. Consequently, many residents waiting for evacuation instructions never received warning of the flood. Nitish Mishra, Bihar's disaster management minister, said, "There should definitely be some accountability," and that action would be taken.

Welsh Hound

The Welsh Hound (Bytheuad) is a breed of hunting dog of the foxhound type, indigenous to Wales.
History.
The Welsh Hound is a native breed to the British Isles, and has descended from the Segussi breed of rough coated hound which existed in northern Europe in Roman times. From medieval times through the early part of the twentieth century, the bards, who had always held a special place in Welsh society, sang odes to the hounds, often naming individual hounds, and praising their qualities. "The ancient laws of Wales codified during the reign of Hywel Dda (942 – 948 AD) give the value of the Welsh Hound as 240 pence trained, 120 pence untrained. By comparison a sound pack horse was valued at the same time as 120 pence."
Temperament.
The Welsh Hound has been kept as a hunting dog for many hundreds of years, living and hunting in packs. It is adapted to hunting in rocky and mountainous terrain in its native Wales. The different traits of the Welsh Hound make it unsuitable for hunting in other parts of the United Kingdom due to the proximity of roads and railway lines. A ban on hunting would have a catasrophic effect on the Welsh Hound since it has been bred to hunt amid the Welsh hills since the immemorial. Welsh Hounds tend to be slower than English hounds so they are not typically used for drag hunting. When trained, Welsh Hounds are very obedient and are expected to be immediately responsive to the huntsman's commands. Because of its irrepressible hunting instincts, the Welsh Hound is completely unsuitable as a pet.
Breed recognition.
The Welsh Hound is registered with The Welsh Hound Association, which has been keeping the breed's stud book since 1922, and maintaining the breed as purebred since 1928. The association was formed "for the purpose of preserving and promoting the Welsh Fox Hound as a specific British breed". The Welsh Hound was recognized by the United Kennel Club on January 1, 2006.
Since the outlawing of hunting with dogs in Great Britain, various clubs have been offering registration for the Welsh Hound as a rare breed pet.
Appearance.
Coat is hard and wiry, red with white patches. Similar in appearance to the (English) Foxhound. Height : 24 in/61 cm Weight : 75 lb/34 kg.

Anything Goes (1956 film)

Anything Goes is a 1956 American musical film directed by Robert Lewis and starring Bing Crosby, Donald O'Connor, Jeanmaire, and Mitzi Gaynor. Adapted from the 1934 stage play "Anything Goes" by Cole Porter, Guy Bolton, and P.G. Wodehouse, the film is about two entertainers scheduled to appear in a Broadway show together who travel to Paris, where each discovers the perfect leading lady for the female role—each promising the role to the girl they selected without informing the other. On the return voyage, with each man having brought his leading lady along, the Atlantic becomes a stormy crossing when each man must tell his discovery that she might not get the role. 
The book was drastically rewritten for this second film version, which was also released by Paramount. Although this version again stars Bing Crosby (whose character was once more renamed), Donald O'Connor, and comedian Phil Harris in a cameo, the film almost completely excises the rest of the original characters in favor of a new plot. The film features almost no similarities to the play or the stage production, apart from some songs and the title.
Plot.
Showbiz partners Bill Benson and Ted Adams each travel to Paris to sign a dancer to star in their new show. The problem? There is only "one" role, and the men have unknowingly cast "two" dancers, Patsy Blair and Gaby Duval. It is up to the men to sort out their mess on the cruise back to America.
Production.
The primary musical numbers ("Anything Goes", "You're the Top", "I Get a Kick Out of You", "It's De-Lovely" and "Blow, Gabriel, Blow") appear in the film with updated arrangements, while the lesser-known Porter songs were cut completely, and new songs, written by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn, were substituted. These substitutions ranged from the lively tap number by Donald O'Connor with bouncy children and as many bouncy balls ("You Can Bounce Right Back") to the crazy kitsch ("Second-hand Turban"). Musical numbers were staged by Nick Castle, with the "Anything Goes" number staged by Ernie Flatt, and Roland Petit providing the choreography of "I Get a Kick of You" for his wife Zizi Jeanmaire.
Soundtrack.
The original soundtrack album was released by Decca Records and includes a mix of soundtrack performances and studio re-creations.
The album stayed in Decca's catalog until 1969 when it was discontinued. In 2004, Decca Broadway re-released the recording on CD with three additional Crosby tracks: "Sailor Beware", "My Heart and I", and "Moonburn".

Mini Graff

Mini Graff is a New Zealand born, Sydney-based street artist who works in and around the city's urban fringe. The streets and inhabitants of the area provide the content and impetus for her work.
Mini Graff stencils and prints images onto a variety of media (walls, boards, vinyl, paper, rarely canvas) which strongly relate to the given environment and community, transforming an anonymous repetitive urban landscape into a unique and personal aesthetic experience. Parody, humor and social commentary are common themes in Graff's work - notions that are translated into experiments with scale in public space - from discrete interventions to large scale installations.
Graff has participated in several public art projects including Sydney Art and About, plus coordinated and presented numerous printmaking workshops to various audience groups including high school students, tertiary institutions and public art galleries. Graffs' recent Suburban Roadhouse series explores concepts of trademark and ownership in public/domestic space.
Mini Graff is featured in the video for Deepchild's song Blackness of the Sea.
Techniques.
Mini Graff's primary medium is handcut stencils transferred with aerosol paint or daubed with sponges. Her installations range from single colour, single stencil works to multiple stencils and colours incorporating 3D elements such as handcut butterflies, plastic figures of people and model houses.
Depending on the nature and exposure of the site, Mini Graff also pre-prints onto paper, stickers and wallpaper, and hangs them in the place of painted stencils.
Mini Graff's recent work has expanded into exploring colour and abstract patterns using brightly coloured adhesive vinyl strips to draw pedestrians' attention to common street structures. Her work demonstrates how a simple treatment applied to an object rendered invisible by familiarity, such as a sign post, can return it to our awareness.

Canterbury in the 2008 Air New Zealand Cup

Canterbury was one of fourteen teams who took part in the 2008 Air New Zealand Cup. At the start of the season Canterbury had yet to win the top-flight New Zealand rugby competition since its change in format, though it had won the 2004 National Provincial Championship and had held the Ranfurly Shield last in 2007. This was the thirty-third consecutive year Canterbury participated at the highest level of provincial rugby, having been at this level every year since the league system was instituted in 1976.
2008 Squad.
The 2008 Air New Zealand Cup squad was announced at the conclusion of the pre-season. The 2008 squad included twelve players new to the Canterbury first team (indicated by an asterisk). The captaincy went to Kieran Read, taking over from previous captain Corey Flynn who, while in the squad came into the season uncertain of a strat due to injury while playing for the Crusaders.
Coach.
Rob Penney
Forwards.
Wyatt Crockett, Ben Franks (on loan to Tasman), Owen Franks*, Corey Flynn, Ti'i Paulo, Steve Fualau, Campbell Johnstone, Peter Borlase*, Michael Paterson, Isaac Ross, James Broadhurst* (2007 Canterbury Colts and Canterbury B), Kieran Read (Captain), Nasi Manu, Hayden Hopgood, George Whitelock* (Otago), Mose Tuiali'i, Richard Wheeler.
Backs.

Unavailable players.
The following Canterbury players were unavailable through the season due to All Blacks duty: Greg Somerville, Richie McCaw, Andrew Ellis, Dan Carter and Leon MacDonald.
Canterbury lost the services of the following players from the 2007 squad due to retirement or transfer: Johnny Leo'o to Japan, Aaron Mauger to Leicester Tigers (England), Caleb Ralph to Fukuoka Sanix Blues (Japan), Reuben Thorne to Yamaha Jubilo (Japan), Kevin O'Neill to Waikato and Kevin Senio to Castres Olympique (France) (Rico Gear who left to play for Worcester Warriors (England) was a loan player from Tasman). Campbell Johnstone left half way through the season.
Pre-season.
Sevens.
Canterbury took part in the provincial sevens tournament at Queenstown with team captained by Steven Yates. Day one saw Canterbury go undefeated with wins over the West Coast 42-0, Wellington 20-10 and North Harbour 27-5. Two losses on day two however saw Canterbury eliminated early on. They were defeated in a close game with southern rivals Otago 17-19 and then fell to perennial sevens stalwart Bay of Plenty 26-29.
Captain Steven Yates headed the try-scoring with five touchdowns while Nick McCashin top-scored with 32 points.
Canterbury 2008 sevens squad: Steven Yates (five tries), Ben Nowell (three tries), Mikaele Tuu'u, Julian Poff (one try), Wane Seru, Ryan Hooper, Nick Thomson (three tries), Jacob Stevens (four tries), Willy Heinz (two tries), Nick McCashin (two tries, eleven conversions), Lloyd Carter (two tries), Pisi Napolioni.
Warm-up matches.
Canterbury's build-up consisted of three matches against Crusaders stablemate Tasman, Southland and Wellington. None of these games were afforded first-class status by Canterbury, although this does not preclude the fact that their opponents in these matches my have awarded provincial caps.
Tasman defeated Cantebury at the small North Canterbury township of Omihi 19-31. This game was played in four twenty minute quarters and featured few first choice players from the previous season. Canterbury then defeated Southland at Rugby Park Invercargill 24-14. The final pre-season game was a defeat to Wellington at Porirua Park 12-20. This game resulted in the unfortunate injury of back-line veteran Casey Laulala who suffered an arm fracture.
Regular season.
Round 6.
This was prop Campbell Johnstone's final game for the province and was given the honour of leading his team onto the field. He earned 69 provincial caps for canterbury in a career that started in 2002 against Marlborough. Johnstone finished with a combined 105 first class appearances for Canterbury and the Crusaders, and three test caps. Steven Brett was selected for the run on side at first five, in what would have been his first game back at top class rugby since injury in the Super 14, but was stood down in favour of Colin Slade. This was the lowest attendance to watch a Canterbury side this season and coincidentally was North Harbour's highest home gate.
Round 7.
Entering this match Northland had failed to win a match since the opening round victory over Waikato while Canterbury had byreflection kept a blemish free campaign since their opening round lost to Manawatu. Northland had not beaten Canterbury since 1999. The expectation was that Canterbury would have little trouble overcoming the Taniwha in what is thought to be their last first class meeting before Northland is demoted to the Heartland Cup. Against expectation Northland proved to be a stern opponent and matched Canterbury in their defensive prowess in a game that after the first twenty-three minutes was scoreless. The game marked the return of Andrew Ellis and Steven Brett, both coming back from injury.
Round 8.
Canterbury ran out convincing winners over a Bay of Plenty team that had shared the top of the table with Wellington three weeks before. After Canterbury's near miss against Northland the previous week Bay of Plenty went to Christchurch believing a win was within their grasp. For both teams home quarter-finals were still very much on the line, but Canterbury took their eighth consecutive victory against the Steamers. Brett, who had returned to the team the previous week, this week took over the goal kicking duties from new-comer Colin Slade. He returned a mixed bag missing four of seven shots.
Round 9.
Corey Flynn played his first game in Canterbury colours this year when he was subbed on for Ti'i Paulo late in the game, he had been convalesing since breaking his arm playing for the Crusaders against the Hurricanes in the Super 14 semi-final earlier in the year. Hawke's Bay were chasing a home quarterfinal spot going into this game and went ahead early, that would prove to be the last time they would trouble the scorers. Canterbury scored 31 unanswered points, based around an inpregnable defensive effort after their early lapse. Stephen Brett showed a return to form with the boot kicking all his conversions and landing a rare drop goal. Canterbury secured a bonus point on the full time hooter and ensured that they would finish second on the table to Wellington regardless of the results in round 10.
Round 10.
Southland's final home game of the season saw them still chasing a possible top four place, while Canterbury were destined to take second regardless of the result. However Canterbury's rock solid defence (the best in the competition after ten weeks) kept the Stags out of the game from the start. Even the 13-0 half time score looked like a match winner. Slade regained his starting place as first five and kicking duties due to Steven Brett's recurring leg injury. Casey Laulala made his first appearance of the season following breaking his arm against Wellington. Mose Tuiali'i however saw his Canterbury career end on a low note by being knocked out cold in a freak lineout clash with team-mate Isaac Ross - ironically Tuiali'i had been benched for most of the game in order to save one of the team's stars of the season for the play-offs.
Play-offs.
Quarter-final.
Tasman hung in to this game as long as they could but the previous two weeks heroics that saw them almost take the Ranfurly Shield off Wellington and then flatten Manawatu could not be repeated against their Crusader stablemates. The Canterbury backline was especially potent with attacking options being in evidence from 9 to 15.
Semi-final.
Richie McCaw made his first provincial start for two years bolstering Canterbury who were one win away from a first final appearance since 2004. A clear and windless night beckoned good omens for running rugby and between them the two sides scored seven tries in a match that will be remembered more for the strong almost vicious contest for the ball. Inspirational Hawkes Bay captain and stalwart left the field and his career after being knocked out cold defending a certain try. On the other side Slade continued his good season with a 16 point haul to take him to second on the scoring chart for the season. This game marked the final home games for Scott Hamilton and Greg Somerville.

Wasilla High School

Wasilla High School (WHS) is a public secondary school in Wasilla, Alaska, United States, serving students in grades 9–12. The school is part of the Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District, with admission based primarily on the locations of students' homes.
The school gained notoriety in 2008 following former pupil, Governor Sarah Palin's nomination as the Republican vice-presidential running mate to John McCain in the 2008 United States presidential election.
Academics.
Classes are run on a semester schedule. Students take seven classes at at time. Classes are offered in: fine arts, language arts, mathematics, physical education, social studies, world language, technology, and science. As of the 2010-2011 school year, there are ten AP classes offered. WHS also participates in the University of Alaska Anchorage's Tech Prep program, allowing students to receive college credit for automotive technology classes.
Athletics.
WHS is a 4A member school of the Alaska School Activities Association (ASAA), the governing body for high school athletics in Alaska.
The fall sports offered at WHS are cross country running, football, cheerleading (football), powderpuff, swimming, and volleyball. The winter sports offered are basketball, hockey, Native Youth Olympics, cross country skiing, cheerleading (basketball), and wrestling. The spring sports offered are baseball, soccer, softball, and track and field.
Environmental projects.
In 2000, Wasilla High School received a $5000 environmental education grant from the Environmental Protection Agency. The school worked in partnership with local government agencies and businesses to raise awareness of groundwater issues in the school and the community. Then, they worked on many projects to tell their community to save the environment.
Extracurricular activities.
Close-Up is program that takes students to study in Washington D.C. for one week. The Rose Urban Rural Exchange program is a one week student exchange program between students in urban and rural Alaska.
Graduation rate.
A Johns Hopkins University study named Wasilla High School as a "dropout factory". Wasilla's dropout rate was 6.5 percent in 2006, a number that was much higher than most of the schools in the Mat-Su district. The study was conducted by finding the difference between a class with 400 freshman students which ended up with 260 seniors four years later. However, the Johns Hopkins study did not follow specific students. If a student started school at Wasilla High and then graduated from another high school, the study would consider him or her a dropout. Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District has an open enrollment policy and it is fairly common for students to transfer from one school to another when their parents found new jobs in other areas. The School Board President Sarah Welton said that the study was flawed and that the false impression made on others in the country would be very unfortunate. Only 58% of incoming freshman graduate as seniors.
In spring of 2009, the students of Wasilla High School took a qualifying exam for graduation. The subjects tested were math, writing, and reading. In math, 87 percent of Wasilla's students received a proficient score. 
Statewide, 80.2 percent of tenth graders received a proficient score.
In writing, 78.1 percent of Wasilla's students received a proficient score. Statewide, 78.8 percent of tenth graders received a proficient score.
In reading, 94.1 percent of Wasilla's students received a proficient score.
Statewide, 90.0 percent of tenth graders received a proficient score.
As of the 2008-2009 school year, Wasilla's graduation rate is 77.8 percent, higher than the statewide graduation rate of 67.6 percent.
In September 2008, Wasilla High had 1300 students.

Incandescence (novel)

Incandescence is a 2008 science fiction novel by Australian author Greg Egan. The book is based on the idea that the theory of general relativity could be discovered by a pre-industrial civilisation.
Plot summary.
The novel has two narratives in alternate chapters. The first follows two citizens of the Amalgam, a Milky Way-spanning civilisation, investigating the origin of DNA found on a meteor by the Aloof. The Aloof control the galactic core and, until the novel begins, have rejected all attempts at contact by the Amalgam. The second narrative is set on a small world known as the Splinter, and covers the attempts by its inhabitants to understand the environment within which their home exists. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that the Splinter orbits a collapsed star within its accretion disk and is subject to various dangers. The two stories come together in a complex twist which involves a kind of past/future first contact role reversal. 
Much of the narrative explores the effects of orbital dynamics around a high mass object and requires an understanding of Newtonian gravitation and at least a basic familiarity with general relativity and its application to black holes and neutron stars to be compelling. Understanding the story's wider frame of reference and the Splinter's encounter with the Wanderer are tied in with this.
The Amalgam is explored in two other short stories, "Glory" and "Riding the Crocodile".
Criticism.
One review compared "Incandescence" to "a not particularly enthralling lecture on the process of scientific discovery, combined with the physics of a black hole"
. Another reviewer described much of this criticism as "trite received opinion" and said the book had "hints of greatness and pleasing moments" but its structure was "a failed literary experiment" and ultimately rather dull.
On June 6, 2008, British writer Adam Roberts released a review criticizing "Incandescence" for its awkward prose and weak characterization.
In response, Egan dissected the review, going so far as to call it "probably the first genuine hatchet job I've ever received.". In particular, he accuses Adam Roberts of malicious nitpicking and a straw man argument, and suggests that Roberts should have known he would be unfairly biased against the book and refused to review it:

Battle of Blood River Poort

In the Battle of Blood River Poort or Scheeper's Nek on 17 September 1901 a Boer commando led by Louis Botha crushed a British force commanded by Major Hubert Gough during the Second Boer War. 
Background.
In August 1901, the Boer leaders determined to send forces south into Natal and the Cape Colony hoping to cause an uprising in the Dutch-majority Cape Colony or at least to gain recruits for their armies. Accordingly, a commando under Botha moved southeast toward Natal while another commando under Jan Smuts raided south into the Cape Colony. 
British Intelligence detected the plan, but Botha evaded the British intercepting columns. The cold spring rains made the march especially difficult for the Boers' horses. On 14 September, Botha let his 1,000-man commando camp near Utrecht to permit the horses to recover. Meanwhile, Gough's 24th Mounted Infantry (MI) made a move by train from Kroonstad in the Orange Free State to Dundee in Natal. Gough received intelligence that Botha and 700 Boers were nearby.
Battle.
Gough led his MI from Dundee to De Jaeger's Drift, a ford on the Buffalo River. Dismissing the intelligence report as exaggerated, he led three companies on a reconnaissance across the river. Through his field glasses, he spotted 300 Boers who dismounted at a farm near Blood River Poort. Leaving his colleague Lieutenant-Colonel H. K. Stewart with 450 MI in the rear, Gough moved forward into a plain in the early afternoon, planning to surprise the Boers at the farm. Unknown to Gough, Botha was moving around his right flank with 700 men.
Botha's mounted attack completely swamped Gough's outnumbered force. Lieutenant Llewellyn Price-Davies of the King's Royal Rifle Corps won the Victoria Cross for valiantly defending the field guns. Gough was captured, escaped, captured again and finally escaped on foot in the darkness. On the British side, four officers and 19 other ranks were killed or mortally wounded, 2 officers and 19 men wounded, and 6 officers and 235 men captured. According to Boer policy, the captured were stripped of their weapons and any useful gear, and most of their clothing, and were allowed to walk to the nearest British post. The Boers seized two field guns, 180 rifles and a large quantity of small arms ammunition. The 200 captured horses turned out to be in poor condition and of little use to the raiders. Boer losses were light.
Aftermath.
Botha was unable to exploit his victory because he found all the crossings of the Buffalo River blocked by the British. The Boers moved to the southeast, hoping to find a place to cross into Natal. On the Zululand border, Botha attacked a British camp named Fort Itala, believing it to be weakly defended. Instead, the Boers received a bloody nose when 56 of their men were killed or wounded. When Botha realized that British forces were approaching in overwhelming strength, he turned back into the Transvaal, his raid a failure.

Pierre de Milard

Pierre de Milard (often referred to as Chevalier Milard, also spelled Chevalier Millard; 1736–1778) was a former French Navy officer, who became a senior officer in the Royal Burmese Armed Forces. He had a key role in supporting the Burmese military efforts against Siam and Qing China. He was lavishly rewarded for his efforts, and made the governor of Tabe. De Milard was very close to King Hsinbyushin. Suffering from a long illness in his last years, the Burmese king asked de Milard on a few occasions to sleep in the same room in order to guard against possible attempts on his life.
Brief.
In 1756, Pierre de Milard was a member of a French navy force of two or three warships sent to Syriam to provide reinforcements and supplies to the forces of Hanthawaddy in the Konbaung–Hanthawaddy War. The force was to join the French officer Sieur de Bruno who was helping defend the city of Syriam against a Konbaung attack. The Konbaung leader Alaungpaya managed to capture Syriam in July 1756 however. The two French ships with reinforcements and supplies were also captured by Alaungpaya, when Alaungpaya forced Bruno to write a letter to trick them. The French captains were killed and the sailors forced to join the Burmese army
Chevalier Milard was among the soldiers who were forced into the Burmese army. He was only 20 years old when he was captured. The incorporated French troops with their guns and muskets played a key role in the later battles between the Burmese and the Mons. They became an elite corps, which was to play a role in the Burmese battles against the Siamese (attacks and capture of Ayutthaya from 1759 to 1767) and the Manchus (battles against the Chinese armies of the Qian Long emperor from 1766 to 1769).
Ultimately Chevalier Milard was nominated Captain of the Guard and Master of the Ordnance for the Konbaung dynasty.
Milard was involved in the reopening of contacts between the Burmese and the French as Burma was looking for supplies of weapons for its conflicts with the Siamese and the Manchu Chinese. Commercial contacts resumed in 1770 and Milard arranged the visit of the French envoy M. Feraud and the re-establishment of the French shipyard in Rangoon.
Milard was very close to the Burmese ruler Hsinbyushin and for some time slept in the same room as him in order to protect him against possible attacks linked to a succession dispute.
Chevalier Milard was also noted for his charitable activities towards schools and churches, thereby promoting Western education in Burma. He died in 1778. He was buried near the village of Ngayabya in the Sagaing district. His tombstone, written in Latin and Burmese was transferred by the Archaeological Department of Burma in 1924 for preservation. His tombstone records that he fought for the Burmese kings in his campaigns against Hanthawaddy Pegu, Ayutthaya or Manipur as "Captain of the Feringhis" ("Captain of the French"), with the title of "Thiri Yazathu Khyawhthin", baron ("myosa") of Tabe in the Sagaing district.

The Horsham & District Football League is an amateur Australian rules football league based in the Wimmera area of Western Victoria.
History.
The league in its present form was created in 1946. Prior to World War 2 a number of local leagues existed around Horsham, shrinking to one in 1934. The clubs that played in the previous incarnation in 1934 were Green Park (who won the premiership), CYMS, Quantong, Adelphians, Church of England, Longerenong and Pimpinio Seconds. The clubs that played in 1946 were Kalkee (who won the premiership), Horsham Homers, Wonwondah, Jung, Wail, Laharum, RSL, Longerenong College, Taylors Lake and YCW.
In 1982 the league expanded after the West Wimmera FL disbanded and five clubs joined, the clubs Goroke, Noradjuha, Douglas-Harrow-Miga Lake, Gerang - Kiata, and Netherby-Lorquon. This brought the total to sixteen clubs, since then Netherby-Lorquon went into recess and Imperials-Wonwondah moved to the Wimmera Football League in 1983.

HMAS "Warrnambool" (FCPB 204), named after the city of Warrnambool, Victoria, was a "Fremantle" class patrol boat of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).
Design and construction.
Starting in the late 1960s, planning began for a new class of patrol boat to replace the "Attack" class, with designs calling for improved seakeeping capability, and updated weapons and equipment. The "Fremantle"s had a full load displacement of , were long overall, had a beam of , and a maximum draught of . Main propulsion machinery consisted of two MTU series 538 diesel engines, which supplied to the two propeller shafts. Exhaust was not expelled through a funnel, like most ships, but through vents below the waterline. The patrol boat could reach a maximum speed of , and had a maximum range of at . The ship's company consisted of 22 personnel. Each patrol boat was armed with a single 40 mm Bofors gun as main armament, supplemented by two .50 cal Browning machineguns and an 81-mm mortar, although the mortar was removed from all ships sometime in the late 90s. The main weapon was originally to be two 30-mm guns on a twin-mount, but the reconditioned Bofors were selected to keep costs down; provision was made to install an updated weapon later in the class' service life, but this did not eventuate.

Oil reserves in Saudi Arabia

The proven oil reserves in Saudi Arabia are the second largest claimed in the world, estimated to be (Gbbl hereafter), including 2.5 Gbbl in the Saudi–Kuwaiti neutral zone. These reserves were the largest in the world until Venezuela announced they had increased their proven reserves to 297 Gbbl in January 2011. The Saudi reserves are about one-fifth of the world's total conventional oil reserves, a large fraction of these reserves comes from a small number of very large oil fields, and past production amounts to 40% of the stated reserves.
Major oil fields.
Although Saudi Arabia has around 100 major oil and gas fields, over half of its oil reserves are contained in only eight giant oil fields, including the Ghawar Field, the biggest oil field in the world with an estimated 70 billion barrels of remaining reserves. 90% of Saudi Arabia's oil production comes from five fields and up to 60% of its production comes from the Ghawar field.
Production.
Saudi Arabia produced (Mbbl/d) in 1980, 10.6 Mbbl/d in 2006, and in the region of 9.2 Mbbl/d in 2008. Saudi Arabia maintains the world’s largest crude oil production capacity, estimated to be approx. 11 Mbbl/d at mid-year 2008 and announced plans to increase this capacity to 12.5 Mbbl/d by 2009 Cumulative production up to, and including, the year 2009 was 119.4 billion bbl. Using the stated number of 267 Gbbl, past production amounts to 40% of the stated reserves.
After the then U.S. president George W. Bush asked the Saudis to raise production on a visit to Saudi Arabia in January 2008 and they declined, Bush questioned whether they had the ability to raise production any more. In the summer of 2008, Saudi Arabia announced an increase in planned production of 500,000 barrels per day. However, there are experts who believe Saudi oil production has already peaked or will do so in the near future.
Data quality.
Since 1982, the Saudis have withheld their well data and any detailed data on their reserves, giving outside experts no way to verify Saudi claims regarding the overall size of their reserves and output. This has caused some to question the current state of their oil fields. In a study discussed in Matthew Simmons's book "Twilight in the Desert", 200 technical papers on Saudi reserves by the Society of Petroleum Engineers were analyzed to reach the conclusion that Saudi Arabia's oil production faces near term decline, and that it will not be able to consistently produce more than 2004 levels. Simmons also argues that the Saudis may have irretrievably damaged their large oil fields by over-pumping salt water into the fields in an effort to maintain the fields' pressure and boost short term oil extraction.
Diplomatic cables leaked during the United States diplomatic cables leak in 2011 revealed that Sadad al Husseini, former vice president of Saudi Arabia's oil monopoly Saudi Aramco, warned the US that the oil reserves in Saudi Arabia might in fact be 40% lower than claimed (300bn barrels).

<doc id="19099904" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19099904" title="Oil reserves in Canada">
Oil reserves in Canada

Oil reserves in Canada were estimated at in 2007. This figure includes the oil sands reserves that are estimated by government regulators to be economically producible at current prices using current technology. According to this figure, Canada's reserves are third only to Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Over 95% of these reserves are in the oil sands deposits in the province of Alberta. Alberta contains nearly all of Canada's oil sands and much of its conventional oil reserves. The balance is concentrated in several other provinces and territories. Saskatchewan and offshore areas of Newfoundland in particular have substantial oil production and reserves. Alberta has 39% of Canada's remaining conventional oil reserves, offshore Newfoundland 28% and Saskatchewan 27%, but if oil sands are included, Alberta's share is over 98%.
Status.
Canada has a highly sophisticated energy industry and is both an importer and exporter of oil and refined products. In 2006, in addition to producing , Canada imported , consumed itself, and exported to the U.S. The excess of exports over imports was . Over 99% of Canadian oil exports are sent to the United States, and Canada is the United States' largest supplier of oil. 
The decision of accounting of the Alberta oil sands deposits as proven reserves was made by the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (AEUB), now known as the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB). Although now widely accepted, this addition was controversial at the time because oil sands contain an extremely heavy form of crude oil known as bitumen which will not flow toward a well under reservoir conditions. Instead, it must be mined, heated, or diluted with solvents to allow it to be produced, and must be upgraded to lighter oil to be usable by refineries. Historically known as bituminous sands or sometimes as "tar sands", the deposits were exposed as major rivers cut through the oil-bearing formations to reveal the bitumen in the river banks. In recent years technological breakthroughs have overcome the economical and technical difficulties of producing the oil sands, and by 2007 64% of Alberta's petroleum production of was from oil sands rather than conventional oil fields. The ERCB estimates that by 2017 oil sands production will make up 88% of Alberta's predicted oil production of .
Analysts estimate that a price of $30 to $40 per barrel is required to make new oil sands production profitable. In recent years prices have greatly exceeded those levels and the Alberta government expects $116 billion worth of new oil sands projects to be undertaken between 2008 and 2017. However the biggest constraint on oil sands development is a serious labor and housing shortage in Alberta as a whole and the oil sands centre of Fort McMurray in particular. According to Statistics Canada, by September, 2006 unemployment rates in Alberta had fallen to record low levels and per-capita incomes had risen to double the Canadian average. Another hurdle has been Canada's capacity to rapidly increase its export pipelines. The National Energy Board indicated that exporters faced pipeline apportionment in 2007. However, surging crude oil prices sparked a jump in applications for oil pipelines in 2007, and new pipelines were planned to carry Canadian oil as far south as U.S. refineries on the Gulf of Mexico.
Canada is the only major oil producer in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to have an increase in oil production in recent years. Production in the other major OECD producers (the United States, United Kingdom, Norway and Mexico) have been declining, as has conventional oil production in Canada. But total crude oil production in Canada was projected to increase by an average of 8.6 percent per year from 2008 to 2011 as a result of new non-conventional oil projects.

Oil reserves in Iraq

Oil reserves in Iraq are considered the world’s fifth-largest proven oil reserves, with 140 billion barrels.
As a result of military occupation and civil unrest, the official statistics have not been revised since 2001 and are largely based on 2-D seismic data from three decades ago. International geologists and consultants have estimated that unexplored territory may contain vastly larger reserves.
A measure of the uncertainty about Iraq's oil reserves is indicated by widely differing estimates. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimated in 2003 that Iraq had . The United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 1995 estimated proven reserves were . Iraq's prewar deputy oil minister said that potential reserves might be . The source of the uncertainty is that due to decades of war and unrest, many of Iraq's oil wells are run down and unkept. Repairs to the wells and oil facilities should make far more oil available economically from the same deposits. Iraq may prove to contain the largest extractable deposits of oil in the entire Middle East once these upgrading and facility improvements have advanced.
After more than a decade of sanctions and two Gulf Wars, Iraq’s oil infrastructure needs modernization and investment. Despite a large reconstruction effort, the Iraqi oil industry has not been able to meet hydrocarbon production and export targets. The World Bank estimates that an additional $1 billion per year would need to be invested just to maintain current production. Long-term Iraq reconstruction costs could reach $100 billion or higher, of which more than a third will go to the oil, gas and electricity sectors. Another challenge to Iraq's development of the oil sector is that resources are not evenly divided across sectarian lines. Most known resources are in the Shiite areas of the south and the Kurdish north, with few resources in control of the Sunni population in the center. 
In 2006, Iraq's oil production averaged , down from around of production prior to the coalition invasion in 2003. Iraq's reserve to production ratio is 158 years.
Oil extraction contracts awarded.
2009.
On June 30 and December 11, 2009, the Iraqi ministry of oil awarded contracts to international oil companies for some of Iraq's many oil fields. The winning oil companies enter joint ventures with the Iraqi ministry of oil, and the terms of the awarded contracts include extraction of oil for a fixed fee of circa $1.40 per barrel. The fees will only be paid once a production threshold set by the Iraqi ministry of oil is reached.
Oil fields contracted include the "super-giant" Majnoon Field, Halfaya Field, West Qurna Field and Rumaila Field. The East Baghdad Field, situated in part under Sadr City, did not receive any bids and the Iraqi oil ministry is considering working the field itself. Oil minister Hussein al-Shahristani told Iraqi public television that the increasing oil production "would finance infrastructure projects across Iraq - schools, roads, airports, housing, hospitals". Iraq's oil deposits hold known reserves of 43 billion barrels of crude, as well as large quantities of natural gas.

Amaldus Nielsen

Amaldus Clarin Nielsen (23 May 1838 – 10 December 1932) was a Norwegian painter.
Early life.
He was born in Halse as a son of shipmaster and merchant Niels Clemetsen Nielsen (1795–1845) and his wife Andrea Marie Møller (1802–1866). He grew up in Mandal in Vest-Agder county, Norway. He lived most of his childhood and adolescence without a father. He received some tuition from a traveling drawing teacher and traveled to Copenhagen to study in 1854.
Career.
After one year of painting studies in Copenhagen, he enrolled at the Academy of Art in 1855. He failed to progress in the academy's system, but with financial support from his brother and business owner Diderik Cappelen (1856-1935), he studied under Hans Gude at the Düsseldorf Academy from 1857 to 1859. He spent the years 1859 to 1863 travelling over Western and Southern Norway, and spent 1863 to 1864 in Düsseldorf again. He is associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting. He then travelled home due to illness, moved to Christiania where he sealed a deal to make paintings that the Christiania Kunstforening would sell at auctions, securing a steady income. He spent the years 1867 to 1868 in Karlsruhe before finally settling at Majorstuen in 1869.
He painted in the naturalist style, and has been called "Norway's first naturalist painter". Important paintings include "Hvalørhei" (1874), "Skovbillede" (1896), "Morgen ved Ny-Hellesund" (1885, one of several from Ny-Hellesund), "Ensomt sted" (1901), "Fra Bankefjorden" (1910) and "Kveld på Jæren" (1925) Most of his paintings portrayed Western and Southern Norway, but also Østfold.
He participated almost annually in the Autumn Exhibit between 1883 and 1911, and held notable exhibitions in Christiania Kunstforening (1895, 1906, 1924, 1931), at the 1862 International Exhibition, the Exposition Universelle of 1889 and in Munich in 1913. Eleven of his works are owned by the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design. He is also represented in Mandal Kunstforening and Mandal Bymuseum, but is perhaps best known for the collection of about 300 works which was donated to Oslo municipality by Nielsen's heirs in 1933. Since 1994 this collection is on permanent exhibit in the Stenersen Museum. Nielsen was also decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1890. The square "Amaldus Nielsens plass", which includes a bust of Nielsen, was named after him.
Personal life.
In October 1868 in Christiania he married Johanne Nicoline Augusta Vangensteen, born 1845 as a daughter of district stipendiary magistrate Ove Bodvar Hussein Vangensteen (1806–1859). The couple had eleven children. Both his wife and three children died in March 1886 from a diphtheria epidemic. After a period of grief, he married Laura Tandberg (1857–1928) in February 1888 in Risør. Nielsen died in December 1932, aged 94, from pneumonia.

TANGO

The TANGO control system is a free open source device-oriented controls toolkit for controlling any kind of hardware or software and building SCADA systems. It is used for controlling synchrotrons, lasers, physics experiments in over 20 sites. It is being actively developed by a consortium of research institutes.
TANGO is a distributed control system. It runs on a single machine as well as hundreds of machines. TANGO uses two network protocols - the omniorb implementation of CORBA and Zeromq. The basic communication model is the client-server model. Communication between clients and servers can be synchronous, asynchronous or event driven. CORBA is used for synchronous and asynchronous communication and Zeromq is used for event-driven communication (since version 8 of TANGO).
TANGO is based on the concept of Devices. Devices implement object oriented and service oriented approaches to software architecture. The Device model in TANGO implements commands/methods, attributes / data fields and properties for configuring Devices. In TANGO all control objects are Devices.
Device Servers.
TANGO is a software for building control systems which need to provide network access to hardware. Hardware can range from single bits of digital input/output up to sophisticated detector systems or entire plant control systems (SCADAs). Hardware access is managed in a process called a Device Server. The Device Server contains Devices belonging to different Device Classes which implement the hardware access. At Device Server startup time Devices (instances of Device Classes) are created which then represent logical instances of hardware in the control system. Clients "import" the Devices via a database and send requests to the devices using TANGO. Devices can store configuration and setup values in a Mysql database permanently.
Hundreds of Device Classes have been written by the community. A list of device classes on SourceForge can be found here. Many more exist and can be obtained by contacting the TANGO community via the mailing list.
TANGO manages complexity using hierarchies.

Smiley v. Citibank

Smiley v. Citibank, (517 U.S. 735), is a 1996 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding a regulation of the Comptroller of Currency which included credit card late fees and other penalties within the definition of interest and thus prevented individual states from limiting them when charged by nationally-chartered banks. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for a unanimous court that the regulation was reasonable enough under the Court's own "Chevron" standard for the justices to defer to the Comptroller.
The decision, which had begun as a class action in California, was seen as a victory for banks and credit-card issuers, who could mostly charge late fees as they pleased. For that same reason consumer advocates were displeased, warning that late fees could rise to previously unseen levels. They did, and one of the Citibank attorneys has expressed regret for his involvement.
The case.
Background.
In its 1978 "Marquette Bank" decision, the court had unanimously held that the National Banking Act of 1863, which created nationally-chartered banks in addition to the state ones that had previously existed, barred states from enforcing their anti-usury laws, which set caps on interest rates, against any national bank based in another state. In 1980, Citibank took advantage of that decision and moved its money-losing credit-card operations to South Dakota, after persuading that state's legislature and governor to repeal its anti-usury law. Other states and banks followed the example, and by 1990 the number of credit cards in circulation had doubled, while the average household's revolving balance increased more than fivefold. At the time late fees were bringing in $2 billion annually to the industry.
The increased use of more freely available credit changed the American economy, but not without creating some backlash. Consumer advocates complained that some issuers were using late fees of $5 or $10, charged if a single month's payment was even one day overdue, to gouge extra profits from customers who might otherwise be borrowing and spending responsibly. Laws in some states limited those fees, yet companies and banks continued to charge rates above those limits, claiming the late fees were a form of interest and thus not subject to the laws of those states as long as they were headquartered elsewhere.
Litigation and regulation.
Activist lawyers were challenging this notion in lawsuits across the country, mostly in state courts, with different degrees of success at different levels. In Pennsylvania, Michael Donovan, Michael Malakoff and Ann Miller had filed one of their own, with the intent of taking it to the Supreme Court and forcing a resolution of the issue. Barbara Smiley, a California woman who had filed a class action against Citibank's South Dakota subsidiary in her state's courts in 1992 alleging that the $15 late fee she was charged for her Citibank Classic card violated California law. After reading about the Pennsylvania lawyers in "Business Week", she contacted them to represent her.
Citibank responded to Smiley's original filing with a motion to dismiss on the grounds that late fees were interest covered by the National Banking Act. California's Superior Court in Los Angeles County denied the motion, but after Citibank appealed that denial, the Second District of the California Courts of Appeal ordered the lower court to either grant the motion or explain why it wasn't. The Superior Court granted the motion and dismissed the case, a decision upheld on appeal.
On March 3, 1995, after the Superior Court had dismissed the complaint, the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC), the official charged by the National Banking Act with regulating national banks, issued a proposed regulation defining "interest" under the Act as including "any payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor ... any default or breach by a borrower of a condition upon which credit was extended." It specifically included late fees, among many others that had been criticized as unfair and misleading to consumers. It was formally adopted a year later.
Later in 1995, the California Supreme Court agreed to review Smiley's case, and did so. It affirmed the lower courts, but with two justices dissenting. Since New Jersey's Supreme Court had reached the opposite conclusion in a similar case, the Supreme Court granted Smiley's "certiorari" petition.
Before the Court.
Donovan argued Smiley's case before the justices. Late fees, he said, were not interest whatever the Comptroller's regulation said since they were fixed amounts and did not vary based on the money owed or schedule of payments. He also pointed to two previous documents from OCC suggesting that, in the past, it did not consider penalty fees of any kind to be interest. For more than a hundred years, he noted, OCC had not seen fit to define specifically what kind of payments were considered interest. Yet, coincidentally, only when a case turning on that issue appeared headed to the Supreme Court did it see a need to do so. 
He claimed that it was not entitled to the deference the Court accorded agencies of the executive branch. It was not, he said, a reasonable interpretation of the National Banking Act and thus, per the rule it had established in the 1984 "Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc." case, the Court should review it afresh and rule on whether it was the best interpretation of the statute.
Richard Kendall of the Los Angeles firm Shearman & Sterling argued the case for Citibank. He was joined by Irving Gornstein on behalf of the government as "amicus curiae". Both argued for the Court to defer to the Comptroller's statutory interpretation.
Decision.
Two months after oral argument, the Court ruled unanimously in Citibank's favor. Antonin Scalia wrote for the Court.
The cases from New Jersey and California, he uncharacteristically agreed, made it "difficult indeed to contend that the word 'interest' in the National Bank Act is unambiguous with regard to the point at issue here." Nevertheless, he rejected all of Donovan's arguments.
The Court did not find the timing of the regulation to be fatal. "antiquity nor contemporaneity with the statute is a condition of validity." It was "irrelevant" that it was issued in advance of a case to be heard by the Supreme Court. He also found the regulation to be rational. "It seems to us perfectly possible to draw a line, as the regulation does, between [penalties and ... all other payments." Nor did he find the prior documents in which representatives of the Comptroller's office had said that they did not consider late fees could be considered as interest payments adequately controlling since they did not fully represent an official agency position. "What these statements show, if anything, is that there was good reason for the Comptroller to promulgate the new regulation, in order to eliminate uncertainty and confusion."
After dealing with another issue Donovan raised, that the regulation was not entitled to deference because it pre-empted state laws, by saying two issues had been confused and thus that question was moot, Scalia said "he question before us is not whether it represents the best interpretation of the statute, but whether it represents a reasonable one. The answer is obviously yes." Legal dictionaries of the late 19th century, as well as the Court's own jurisprudence of that era, did not define interest so narrowly, and indeed such flat fees were often intended to evade state anti-usury laws, as state courts of that era had ruled. Finally, he rejected an argument that penalties were inherently separate from interest by suggesting the petitioner had misread the case they were relying on and citing what he considered more appropriate. The section of the National Banking Act at issue, he noted, did not distinguish between interest and penalties.
Reaction.
Lawyers and lobbyists for the credit-card industry, who had feared costly litigation and a myriad of state laws if the Court ruled against OCC, praised the decision. "It's a big victory for the 97 percent or so of cardholders who pay their bills on time," said a Citibank spokeswoman. "There's no reason why those of us who pay on time should subsidize those who do not", said Kendall. That's not equity."
On the other side, Donovan described the result as "an unfortunate interpretation ... that will allow small states to override the longstanding consumer protection laws of more heavily populated ... states." His co-counsel Ann Miller called the decision "incorrect and shortsighted ... I don't think that the answer the U.S. Supreme Court came up with is going to be the long-term resolution of the problems posed by old laws trying to deal with new and very changed banking practices."
Donovan was especially critical of the role played by the OCC. "We got tackled by a player standing on the sideline as we were sprinting toward the goal line". However, it did show him that he'd underestimated the role played by a regulatory body that, he recalled William Rehnquist saying during oral argument, had never come before the Court with a regulation that wasn't favorable to the banking industry. "We should have focused more on the appropriateness of an executive agency defining what Congress meant by a law as opposed to a court defining what Congress meant by a law."
Aftermath.
Duncan McDonald, formerly general counsel for Citibank's credit-card division. He and others had merely hoped to have the freedom to set the fees at the $15 they had calculated as a fair market rate, but afterwards some cards late fees went as high as $39.
"I certainly didn't imagine that someday we might've ended up creating Frankenstein," he told PBS's "Frontline" a decade later. "Millions and millions of people are being excessively charged late fees and bad-check fees and over-the-limit fees and then these 25 percent APRs to make the profits for the industry, so that they can keep the rates lower for people who are rate sensitive, who can in fact shop the system."
On May 22, 2009, the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the Credit CARD Act) was signed into law.

Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń

Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń (; UMK) is located in Toruń, Poland. It was named after Nicolaus Copernicus who was born in this town in 1473.
History.
The beginnings of higher education in Toruń.
The first institution of higher education in Torun, the Toruń Academic Gymnasium was founded in 1568 on Piekary street. It was one of the first universities in northern Poland. The Academic Gymnasium was the precursor to scientific and cultural life (including the first museum created in 1594) in the region. Thanks to the efforts of Heinrich Stroband, city mayor in 1594, academics in Toruń received good working conditions for teaching and research. Among his professors in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were meritorious scholars of Polish and Prussian history, authors of textbooks and papers from various disciplines of humanities, and associates scientific journals.
The establishment of the university in a modern form began in the nineteenth century. During the partitions of Poland the Prussian government planned to create a University of Theology, which was to include faculties of law and economics, unfortunately this project did not materialise.
In the interwar period the city authorities of Toruń again sought to establish a university. Soon after the annexation of Pomerania to the reborn Poland in 1920, a new phase of efforts to develop the university began. Even before 1920 the Supreme People's Council had considered the proposal to establish higher educational institutions in the Polish territories annexed by Prussia at the University of Gdansk and in Toruń. However, political developments and the uncertain future of Pomerania prompted the council's leadership to accept the December 1918 resolution of the Sejm to overlook Toruń as a location for a new university and instead go ahead with the development of a university in Poznań.
In 1920, the first declaration requesting the establishment of a university was put forward in November by the National Workers Party whose members chose Toruń-born Nicolaus Copernicus to be the patron of the University. For this purpose a number of educational societies, such as the Baltic Institute (later transferred to Gdynia, and then to Gdańsk) amongst others, were established in the town.
Finally in 1938 it was decided to set up the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń as a subsidiary of Poznań's Adam Mickiewicz University; work was to start at the beginning of 1940. This program, however, was interrupted by World War II. It was not until 1947, (two years after the creation of the Nicolaus Copernicus University) that prof. Karol Gorski revealed that before the outbreak of World War II there was an approved plan to open Poznań University long-distance division in Toruń in 1940, to teach the humanities and theology.

Oil reserves in Venezuela

The proven oil reserves in Venezuela are claimed to be the largest in the world, according to an announcement in early 2011 by then president Hugo Chávez and the Venezuelan government. The reported proven reserves reach , surpassing that of the previous long-term world leader, Saudi Arabia. OPEC said that Saudi Arabia's reserves stood at in 2009. The appropriateness of this politically beneficial rapid increase in Venezuela's proven reserves is controversial.
Venezuela's development of its oil reserves has been affected by political unrest in recent years. In late 2002, nearly half of the workers at the state oil company PDVSA went on strike, after which the company fired 18,000 of them. The crude oil that Venezuela has is very heavy by international standards, and as a result much of it must be processed by specialized domestic and international refineries. Venezuela continues to be one of the largest suppliers of oil to the United States, sending about to the U.S. Venezuela is also a major oil refiner and the owner of the Citgo gasoline chain.
In October 2007, the Venezuelan government said its proven oil reserves had risen to . The energy and oil ministry said it had certified an additional of proven reserves in the country's Faja del Orinoco region. In February 2008, Venezuelan proven oil reserves were .
By 2009, Venezuela reported of conventional oil reserves, the largest of any country in South America. In 2008, it had net oil exports of to the United States. As a result of the lack of transparency in the country's accounting, Venezuela's true level of oil production is difficult to determine, but OPEC analysts estimate that it produced around of oil in 2009. This would give it 234 years of remaining production at current rates.
Orinoco Oil Belt.
In addition to conventional oil, Venezuela has oil sands deposits similar in size to those of Canada, and approximately equal to the world's reserves of conventional oil. Venezuela's Orinoco tar sands are less viscous than Canada's Athabasca oil sands – meaning they can be produced by more conventional means – but they are buried too deep to be extracted by surface mining. Estimates of the recoverable reserves of the Orinoco Belt range from to . In 2009, USGS updated this value to .
According to the United States Geological Survey, the Orinoco Belt alone is estimated to contain 900– of heavy crude in proven and unproven deposits. Of this, the United States Geological Survey estimated that 380– could be technically recoverable, which would make Venezuela's total recoverable reserves (proven and unproven) among the largest in the world. The technology needed to recover ultra-heavy crude oil, such as in most of the Orinoco Belt, may be much more complex and expensive than that of Saudi Arabia's light oil industry.

Oil reserves in Russia

There have been widely varying estimates of proven oil reserves in Russia. Most estimates included only Western Siberian reserves, which have been exploited since the 1970s and supply two-thirds of Russian oil. However, there are potentially huge reserves elsewhere. In 2005, the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources estimated that another of oil exist in Eastern Siberia. In July 2013, the Russian Natural Resources Ministry made official estimates of reserves available for the first time. According to Russian Natural Resources Minister Sergey Donskoy, as of 1 January 2012, recoverable reserves of oil in Russia under category ABC1 (equivalent to proven reserves) were 17.8 billion tons and category C2 reserves (equivalent to probable and possible) were 10.9 billion tons.
Production.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia’s petroleum output fell sharply, and has rebounded only in the last several years. Soviet Union reached a peak of in total liquids in 1988, and production had fallen to around by the mid-1990s. A turnaround in Russian oil output began in 1999, which many analysts attribute to the privatization of the industry. Higher world oil prices, the use of Japanese technology, and the rejuvenation of old oil fields also helped. By 2007 Russian production had recovered to , but was growing at a slower rate than 2002-2004. In 2008, production fell 1 percent in the first quarter and Lukoil vice president Leonid Fedun said $1 trillion would have to be spent on developing new reserves if current production levels were to be maintained. The editor-in-chief of the Russian Petroleum Investor claims that Russian production had reached a secondary peak in 2007.
In 2007, Russia produced roughly of liquids, consumed roughly in liquids, and exported (in net) around . Over 70 percent of Russian oil production was exported, while the remaining 30 percent was refined locally. In early 2008 Russian officials were reported to be concerned because, after rising just 2% during 2007, oil production started to decline again in 2008. The Russian government proposed tax cuts on oil in an attempt to stimulate production.
By 2011, Russian oil production had increased to 10,540,000 bbl/day. It is the largest producer and exporter of oil in the world.

The Russia reserve estimates in the table below were posted in 2006, except that from the US EIA
The ABC1 classification is based on the Russian system, and is that system's closest equivalent to the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) proven reserves. It is regarded by some as somewhat less strict than the SPE proven reserves.

Nilambur–Shoranur railway line

The Nilambur–Shoranur railway ( ) is a branch line of the Southern Railway Zone in Kerala state and one of the shortest broad gauge railway lines in India. It is a single line with 66 km length running from Shoranur Junction (in Palakkad district) to Nilambur Railway Station (in Malappuram district). This station is just 4 km from the town of Nilambur on the Kozhikode–Ooty highway. Shoranur–Nilambur Road passenger trains are running on this route.
It is 40 km away from Malappuram town.
History.
Nilambur is well known for its rich forest, and teak plantation. During the British rule, this forest used to cater to the needs of strong woods for all constructions and furniture making. This was the reason for connecting the railway line to Nilambur from Shoranur junction. Another reason was to quickly transport armed forces to control Malabar Rebellion occurred in 1921. The line was opened in 1927 in stages: from Shoranur to Angadipuram on 3 February, on to Vaniyambalam on 3 August, with completion on 26 October. The line was closed on 5 JDecember 1940, reopening due to public protest to Angadipuram in April 1953 and throughout on 15 April 1954.
Scenery.
The line passes through the eastern part of the Malappuram district and one can enjoy the beauty of the Nilambur forests while passing through. The line crosses Kunthippuzha between Kulukkalloor and Cherukara which borders Palakkad and Malappuram districts. Velliyar river, a major tributary of Kadalundi river (between Pattikkad and Melattur), Olippuzha river, another tributary of Kadalundi river (between Melattur and Tuvvur) and Kuthirappuzha, a tributary of Chaliyar river (between Vaniyambalam and Nilambur road) are other major rivers that this line crosses. Vaniyambalam Para, a huge granite rock is visible from the railway line which is one kilometer away from the Vaniyambalam station.

The future.
The Nilambur-Mysore Railway Action Council aims to link this line to Nanjangud near Mysore.(Golden I.T. Corridor)
It is hoped that this line will be extended up to Mysore, with its possible route being Nilambur–Gudalur Road (Devala)–Sulthan Bathery–Nanjangud–Mysore. With the extension, the route would become the shortest route from Kerala to Bangalore, Mysore, Hyderabad and North Indian cities. It is expected that the railway line would be extended by 236 km for this purpose. The engineering cum traffic survey of this line has been completed. and the estimated cost of the new line is around 3800 crores.
Sanction has been granted in principle for this line by the Railway Board and Planning Commission.

Oil reserves in Libya

Oil reserves in Libya are the largest in Africa and the fifth largest in the world with as of 2010. Oil production was as of 2010, giving Libya 77 years of reserves at current production rates if no new reserves were to be found. Libya is considered a highly attractive oil area due to its low cost of oil production (as low as $1 "per" barrel at some fields), and proximity to European markets. Libya's challenge is maintaining production at mature fields, while finding and developing new oil fields. Most of Libya remains unexplored as a result of past sanctions and disagreements with foreign oil companies.
The majority (85%) of Libyan oil is exported to European markets. 11% or of oil imports to the European union in 2010 came from Libya, making it the third biggest importer behind Norway and Russia.
Cumulative production through 2009 was 27 Gbbl. Given the stated number, this would be 65% of reserves.
The drilling of oil wells in Libya was first authorised by the Petroleum Law of 1955. The National Oil Corporation is the largest oil company of Libya .

Oil reserves in Nigeria

Although Libya has more reserves, there were of proven oil reserves in Nigeria as of 2011, ranking the country as the largest oil producer in Africa and the 11th largest in the world, averaging in 2006. At current rates this would be 45 years of supply if no new oil was found. Pipeline vandalism, kidnappings, and militant takeover of oil facilities have reduced production, which could be increased to in the absence of such problems. The Nigerian government hopes to increase oil production capacity to by 2010. Nigeria is the world’s eighth largest exporter of crude oil and sends 43% of its exports to the United States. Nigeria is heavily dependent on the oil sector, which accounts for 95% of its export revenues.
Prospective resources.
Nigeria and São Tomé have an agreement in which the Joint Development Authority was created to explore and produce oil in the waters between Sao Tome and Nigeria. Nigeria and Sao Tome share this area, called the Joint Development Zone, or JDZ. This area could contain up to, or over, 14 billion barrels of oil. In 2006, Chevron drilled an exploratory well called OBO-1 and news reports came out that they had discovered over a thousand million barrels of oil in block 1 alone. The news, reported on CNN, AP,

Pedro de Avendaño

Pedro de Avendaño a Spanish soldier that had arrived in Chile with the army of García Hurtado de Mendoza in 1557. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Millarapue. He later served in the garrison of Cañete under captain Alonso de Reinoso. Reinoso eventually found an Indian who betrayed the location of the fugitive Mapuche toqui Caupolicán. Avendaño, with 50 men and the traitorous Indian as a guide, marched in stormy weather into the mountains to Pilmaiquén and captured Caupolicán as he was planning a new counter-offensive against the Spanish, near the modern Antihuala, on February 5, 1558. He brought the toqui back to Cañete where he was eventually executed by empalement at the order of corregidor Reinoso. 
Given an encomienda in Purén, his bad treatment of the natives in his charge was infamous among the Mapuche. During the short interim governorship of Rodrigo de Quiroga following the departure of Mendoza, in July 1561, Avendaño and two other Spaniards were ambushed and killed and their heads taken by a group of Mapuche under Guenupilqui near Purén. News of this killing and the display of the heads, triggered the second great Mapuche revolt in the Arauco War.

Oil reserves in the United States

Proven oil reserves in the United States were as of 2011, excluding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The 2011 data represent a 39% increase in proved reserves since 2008. The Energy Information Administration estimates US undiscovered technically recoverable oil resources to be an additional 198 billion barrels.
Proven reserves.
US proven oil reserves were as of 2011. The 2011 data represent a 39% increase in proved reserves since 2008, but is 32% lower than the of proven reserves in 1970, when the supergiant Prudhoe Bay field was found in Alaska. 
Production.
United States crude oil production had been declining since reaching a smaller secondary production peak in 1988 (caused by Alaskan production). Total production of crude oil from 1970 through 2006 was , or roughly five and a half times the decline in proved reserves. Since the oil price peaked about US$147.50 in summer 2008 many projects have been brought online. It takes a few years to develop an oil field. In 2012 the oil production of the USA increased by 800,000 barrels, the highest ever recorded increase in one year since oil drilling began 1859. Oil-bearing shales in North Dakota and Montana are producing increasing amounts of oil. As of April 2013, US crude production was at a more than 20-year high, since the shale gas and tight oil boom; production was near 7.2 million barrels per day. Experts think that the USA could pass Saudi Arabia as the largest oil producer.
The reserves-to-production ratio (R/P) equaled 11.26 years in 2007. The ratio was 11.08 years in 1970. It hit a trough of 8.49 years in 1986 as oil pumped through the Alaska pipeline began to peak.
Consumption and imports.
The US consumption of petroleum products peaked in 2005; by 2012, consumption had declined 11% from the peak. 
Net imports of oil and products account for nearly half of the US trade deficit. Because of declining production and increasing demand, net US imports of oil and petroleum products increased from in 1970 to in 2007, before declining. Its largest net suppliers of petroleum products in 2007 were Canada and Mexico, which supplied , respectively. As of 2011, the US consumed 18.8 million barrels of petroleum products per day, and imported a net 8.4 million barrels per day; the EIA reported the United States "Dependence on Net Petroleum Imports" in 2011 as 45%. During 2008-2009 the USA became a net exporter of refined oil products; before the US bought gasoline, diesel and kerosene in Europe, and smaller amounts from other countries.
Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
The United States maintains a Strategic Petroleum Reserve at four sites on the Gulf of Mexico, with a total capacity of of crude oil. The maximum total withdrawal capability from the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve is per day. This is roughly 32% of US oil imports, or 75% of imports from OPEC.
Prospective resources.
Services under the U.S. Department of the Interior estimate the total volume of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil in the United States to be roughly . Over 1 million exploratory and developmental crude oil wells have already been drilled in the US since 1949.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates undiscovered technically recoverable crude oil onshore in United States to be 
Offshore.
The Minerals Management Service (MMS) estimates the Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) contains between of undiscovered technically recoverable crude oil, with a mean estimate of . The Gulf of Mexico OCS ranks first with a mean estimate of , followed by Alaska OCS with . At $80/bbl crude prices, the MMS estimates that are economically recoverable. As of 2008, a total of about of the OCS are off-limits to leasing and development. The moratoria and presidential withdrawal cover about 85 percent of OCS area offshore the lower 48 states. The MMS estimates that the resources in OCS areas currently off limits to leasing and development total (mean estimate).
Arctic.
In 1998, the USGS estimated that the 1002 area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge contains a total of between 5.7 and of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil, with a mean estimate of , of which falls within the Federal portion of the ANWR 1002 Area. In May 2008 the EIA used this assessment to estimate the potential cumulative production of the 1002 area of ANWR to be a maximum of from 2018 to 2030. This estimate is a best case scenario of technically recoverable oil during the area's primary production years if legislation were passed in 2008 to allow drilling.
A 2002 assessment concluded that the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska contains between 6.7 and of oil, with a mean (expected) value of . The quantity of undiscovered oil beneath Federal lands (excluding State and Native areas) is estimated to range between 5.9 and 13.2 BBO, with a mean value of 9.3 BBO. Most oil accumulations are expected to be of moderate size, on the order of 30 to each. Large accumulations like the Prudhoe Bay oil field (whose ultimate recovery is approximately ), are not expected to occur. The volumes of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil estimated for NPRA are similar to the volumes estimated for ANWR. However, because of differences in accumulation sizes (the ANWR study area is estimated to contain more accumulations in larger size classes) and differences in assessment area (the NPRA study area is more than 12 times larger than the ANWR study area), economically recoverable resources are different at low oil prices. But at market prices above $40 per barrel, estimates of economically recoverable oil for NPRA are similar to ANWR.
Tight oil.
In April 2008, the USGS released a report giving a new resource assessment of the Bakken Formation underlying portions of Montana and North Dakota. The USGS believes that with new horizontal drilling technology there is somewhere between of undiscovered, technically recoverable oil in this formation that was initially discovered in 1951. If accurate, this reassessment would make it the largest "continuous" oil accumulation (The USGS uses "continuous" to describe accumulations requiring extensive artificial fracturing to allow the oil to flow to the borehole) ever discovered in the U.S. The formation is estimated to contain significantly more - figures in excess of have been reported - but it is yet uncertain how much of this oil is recoverable using current technology. In 2011, Harold Hamm claimed that the recoverable share may reach ; this would mean that Bakken contains more extractable petroleum than all other known oil fields in the country, combined.
Unconventional prospective resources.
Oil shale.
The United States has the largest known deposits of oil shale in the world, according to the Bureau of Land Management and holds an estimated of potentially recoverable oil. Oil shale does not actually contain oil, but a waxy oil precursor known as kerogen. There is no significant commercial production of oil from oil shale in the United States.
Oil sands.
There are significant volumes of heavy oil in the oil sands of northeast Utah. There has yet to be any significant production from these deposits
